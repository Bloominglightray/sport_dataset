The following year, 1882, the championships opened to international competitors. Between 1890 and 1906 sectional tournaments were held in the east and the west of the country to determine the best two doubles teams, which competed in a play-off in Newport to see who would play the defending champions in the challenge round. The challenge system was abolished in 1920. The doubles event was held in various locations; Newport (1881–1914), Forest Hills (1915–1916, 1942–1945, 1968–1977), Longwood (1917–1933, 1935–1941, 1946–1967) and Germantown, Philadelphia (1934) before it settled in 1978 at the USTA National Tennis Center, now the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, in New York City.\nChampions.\nU.S. National Championships.\nThe following pairings won the U.S. Open tennis championship, or its predecessor United States National tennis championship, in Men's Doubles.\nSee also.\nU.S. Open other competitions\nGrand Slam men's doubles"

        "text": "WWF WrestleMania X8 (later rebranded \"WWE\") is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and released on the GameCube by THQ in June 2002.\nGameplay.\n\"WrestleMania X8\" features a simple grappling system. Each wrestler has five front grapples, five rear grapples, and miscellaneous grapples, such as an evade and grapple in which a wrestler will dodge and then perform a hold or throw. There are meters based on color for the competitors in a match, and a pin is possible when the player's meter is fully red and their opponent's is fully blue. A large portion of the gameplay revolves around counter moves, with different buttons countering different maneuvers and allow different responses, such as strike and grapple. The game features a wide selection of signature moves used by wrestlers, and all wrestlers in the game have their unique entrances. There are a variety of weapons available, as well as the ability to perform a number of different grapples with them.\nThe game features a variety of match types, including Standard, Hardcore, Table, Ladder, TLC, Battle Royal, Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell, and Ironman. The number of participants in the match can also be chosen, including a singles match, a tag team match, a handicap match, Triple Threat, Fatal Four-Way, Battle Royal, and Royal Rumble. The Hell in a Cell match features the ability to utilize unique grapples on the walls of the cell, as well as the ability to climb to the roof of the cell and fight atop it, with the option of throwing an opponent through the roof to the mat below.\nThe game marks the WWE video game debuts of former WCW and ECW wrestlers signed during the Invasion storyline such as Booker T, Rob Van Dam, The Hurricane, and Lance Storm (Diamond Dallas Page, another major figure in the WCW/ECW Alliance and the WWF European Champion entering the namesake pay-per-view, was not included in the game). It was also the first appearance of Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair on a WWF/WWE video game since the 16-bit \"WWF Royal Rumble\" game (Hogan was on the Genesis version, while Flair was on the SNES version), as well as the only appearance for Scott Hall as an active WWE wrestler under the nWo gimmick, as he was released from the company prior to the game's release and was thus removed from \"WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth\". In addition, the game features \"Rollin'\" as The Undertaker's entrance theme music although Fred Durst was not included in the game in contrast to previous WWF games that featured the song, while some former WCW wrestlers (including the nWo) and The Hardy Boyz do not have their proper entrance music.\nModes.\nThe game features a Path of a Champion mode, a single player mode in which a player can attempt a championship path and make an attempt to win it. The titles offered are the WWF Heavyweight Championship, WWF Intercontinental Championship, WWF European Championship, WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, WWF Hardcore Championship and WWF World Tag Team Championship. There are four difficulties in which to play the mode, and there are a variety of unlockables for winning championships with particular wrestlers.\nAnother mode in the game is the Battle for the Belts mode, in which a player can go after one of 51 fictional belts, some of which actually resemble real title belts from other promotions, such as the XPW World Heavyweight Championship, the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the WCW Hardcore Championship, the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship, and the AWA World Heavyweight Championship (circa 1970's). \"Battle for the Belts\" even has the WWF Women's Championship, despite the belt itself not being featured in the Path of a Champion mode, as well as the Smoking Skull and Brahma Bull Championships (the latter of which was never actually seen on WWF programming). A player can challenge either the CPU controlled wrestler who holds the belt or another player who has the belt in an attempt to win it. A player can customize the belt by naming it and changing its color. The game also features a Create-A-Wrestler mode in which a wrestler can be created with customized appearance, moves, profile, and a wide variety of other options.\nDevelopment.\n\"WrestleMania X8\" was Yuke's first WWE game on a Nintendo platform, replacing AKI Corporation as the developer for these systems; some former AKI developers were hired by Yuke's to develop a game with gameplay style closer to their titles rather than Yuke's own \"SmackDown\" series on PlayStation, while taking advantage of GameCube's graphical capabilities compared to Nintendo 64.\nThe game's development was complete before the World Wrestling Federation's lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund, but was released after, so the packaging was initially released with the unabbreviated \"World Wrestling Federation\" before changing to feature the new World Wrestling Entertainment logo. Although new packaging and paraphernalia feature the WWE logo, the game still contains the WWF logo, only removed from the \"fist\" SmackDown and Raw stages. Stone Cold Steve Austin was replaced with The Rock on the cover of later releases due to Austin's walkout following the game's release.\nReception.\n\"WWF WrestleMania X8\" received \"average\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of 32 out of 40.\nSequel.\nThe game was succeeded by \"WWE WrestleMania XIX\" for the GameCube in 2003."

        "text": "WWE WrestleMania XIX is a professional wrestling video game released for the GameCube by THQ in 2003. Based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), it is the sequel to \"WWE WrestleMania X8\". The roster consists of around sixty-nine WWE wrestlers between May 2002 and March 2003, as the WWE was beginning to shift its momentum from the Attitude Era into the Ruthless Aggression Era.\nUnlike the previous game and other contemporary WWE games, \"WrestleMania XIX\" does not feature a conventional story/career mode in which players control a particular wrestler in a series of matches. Instead, the game features \"Revenge Mode\" a mission-based mode in which players try to achieve certain goals in various locations outside of the ring. Most of the background music of the game was also in the Xbox game \"WWE Raw 2\" and the PlayStation 2 game \"WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain\".\nRevenge Mode.\nIn Revenge Mode, players can select any superstar on the roster (except for Stephanie McMahon and Vince McMahon) or a created superstar. The story begins with the player being dragged out of an arena by security guards and literally tossed into the street. Later, the player encounters Stephanie McMahon. Stephanie notices that the player wants revenge on Vince McMahon for firing them, and the player and Stephanie devise a plan to ruin Vince's flagship pay-per-view, WrestleMania. To do this, the player is sent to various locations and must combat workers and wrestlers hired as security (both authentic and created who are generated and unlocked randomly) they encounter in each location, with objectives such as disrupting a construction site, sinking a WWE owned shipment barge, and destroying a mall that was set up for fan festivities.\nAfter the player completes objectives in the perimeter areas, they fight Vince at WrestleMania XIX in a match. If the player wins, Stephanie appears to congratulate the player but immediately regrets the deal, getting speared by Goldberg and seemingly disappearing into cash.\nReception.\nCritic reviews.\nThe game received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\nSequel.\n\"WrestleMania XIX\" was succeeded by \"WWE Day of Reckoning\" in 2004."

At 6'4\" and 185 pounds he had talent as both a right-handed pitcher and as a basketball player. His high school nickname was \"bean pole\". As a senior at Garden City High School, he helped lead his team to their first-ever Nassau County baseball championship in 1945, and was a star basketball player; he was subsequently one of the inaugural inductees into the Nassau County High School Sports Hall of Fame. He enrolled in Colgate College and played collegiately for the Colgate University Raiders in 1945–1946. In the summer of 1947 was signed by the New York Yankees while still only 19 years old. He played two seasons for Yankee farm teams in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and then Amsterdam, New York, appearing in 35 games compiling a 2–3 won-lost record.\nIn between those minor league baseball seasons, he also joined the New York Knicks for their 1947–1948 season, effectively playing in two professional sports simultaneously. On December 6, 1947, he set a then NBA single-game scoring record, recording 47 points. Incredibly he pitched one more season in the Yankees organization that following summer, until deciding that basketball was his future.\nBraun was one of the premier guards of the 1950s and spent 13 seasons in the NBA, all but the last with the New York Knicks. Braun led the Knicks in scoring during his first seven seasons. He did not play during the 1950–1951 or 1951–1952 seasons due to military service. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team in 1948 and 1954. He ended his career in 1962, after one season with the Boston Celtics. Braun played in five NBA All-Star Games and scored 10,625 points in his professional career. Braun was a player-coach for the Knicks in 1960 and 1961 as well, compiling a 40–87 head coaching record.\nCarl Braun is featured in the 1948 Bowman set of basketball cards, the 1957 Topps set, and the 1961 Fleer set. Though sportscaster Marty Glickman made the term \"swish\" a popular basketball colloquialism, he attributed the genesis of the word to Braun, who he heard say it following a good shot during warmup. Glickman used the term frequently in broadcasts throughout the 1950s. Braun was elected to the National Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.\nPersonal life.\nBraun was born in Brooklyn and moved to Garden City, New York as a teenager where he went to high school and lived most of his adult life. After retiring from professional sports, Braun was a Wall Street stockbroker. He retired to Florida around 1990. He married his wife Joan in 1952 with whom he had four daughters Susan, Patricia, Nancy and Carol, and six grandchildren. He and Joan were married 58 years."

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\nEarly career.\nHe attended the then Longwood College (at the time an NCAA Division II school) from 1989 through 1992. In November 2005, Tucker was among the selection of Longwood's first Hall of Fame class, including basketball player Jerome Kersey and LPGA golfer Tina Barrett.\nAfter college, Tucker begin his pro baseball career in the minors in . Tucker spent most of the 1993 season with the Single-A Carolina League Wilmington Blue Rocks. Before making the move up to Double-A and spending time with the Memphis Chicks of the Southern League. In , Tucker played in Triple-A with the Omaha Royals of the American Association before joining Major League Baseball and the Kansas City Royals.\nMajor League career.\nTucker made his Major League debut for the Royals at age 23 on April 26, 1995. Starting in left field and batting leadoff, Tucker singled in his first big-league at-bat against pitcher Mike Mussina in a 5-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles. Before the 1997 season, Tucker was traded to the Braves along with Keith Lockhart in exchange for outfielder Jermaine Dye and pitcher Jamie Walker.\nTucker enjoyed his most productive season in 1997 with the Braves, when he posted career highs in batting average (.283), runs (80) and hits (141) in 138 games.

        "title": "Code of Points (gymnastics)",
        "text": "The Code of Points is a rulebook that defines the scoring system for each level of competition in gymnastics. There is not a universal international \"Code of Points\", and every oversight organization — such as the FIG (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique), NCAA Gymnastics, and most national gymnastics federations — designs and employs its own unique \"Code of Points\".\nThe FIG Code of Points.\nThe FIG Code of Points is defined in a public document provided by the Federation. Gymnasts competing at lower levels or outside the FIG's jurisdiction (e.g., NCAA gymnastics and local club teams) may not be scored according to the FIG code.\n2006 Revised Code.\nIn 2006, the \"Code of Points\" and the entire gymnastics scoring system were completely overhauled. The change stemmed from the judging controversy at 2004 Olympics in Athens, which brought the reliability and objectivity of the scoring system into question, and arguments that execution had been sacrificed for difficulty in artistic gymnastics. It follows a similarly radical scoring change in figure skating that also was prompted by irregularities in judging at major events.\nProponents of the new system believe it is a necessary step in advancing gymnastics, promoting difficult skills and increasing judging objectivity. Opponents feel that people outside the gymnastics community will not understand the scoring and will lose interest in the sport, and that, without emphasising artistry, the essence of gymnastics will change. Many opponents of the new scoring system feel that this system, in essence, chooses the winners before competition ever begins. Competitors no longer compete on the same level. Each contestant begins with a unique start value; therefore, contestants assigned a lower start value or difficulty rating are knocked out of the winner's circle before the competition begins. They may compete, but they cannot win. A competitor with a higher difficulty rating will begin competition with a higher combined base score. There has been dissent over the fact that the new \"Code\" effectively abolishes the \"perfect 10\" score, for many years one of the hallmarks of gymnastics. There has also been concern that the new \"Code\" strongly favors extreme difficulty over form, execution and consistency. At the 2006 World Championships, for instance, Vanessa Ferrari of Italy was able to controversially win the women's all-around title despite a fall on the balance beam, in part by picking up extra points from performing more high-difficulty skills on floor exercise. The 2006 report of the FIG's Athletes' Commission, drafted after a review and discussion of the year's events noted several areas of concern including numerous inconsistencies in judging and evaluation of skills and routines.\nHowever, the leadership of the FIG remains committed to the new \"Code.\" While small revisions have been made to the \"Code,\" there is currently no indication that it will be significantly altered or that there will be a return to the old \"Code\" or 10.0 scoring system.\nTable of elements.\nThe \"Table of Elements\" is the section of the \"Code of Points\" used to identify, classify and assign value to gymnastics elements. Every acrobatic and dance skill is listed, illustrated and assigned a difficulty rating. For all apparatus except vault, difficulty ratings for both the women's and men's elements range from A (easiest) to J (most difficult). Difficulty ratings are valued as follows: A (.10), B (.20), C (.30), D (.40), E (.50), F (.60), G (.70), H (.80), I (.90), and J (1.0). The values are used to tabulate the gymnast's score. Each vault is assigned a difficulty value ranging from 2.0 (easiest) to 6.4 (most difficult). The \"Table of Elements\" did not undergo major changes in the 2006 \"Code\" overhaul.\nAs other aspects of the \"Code,\" the \"Table of Elements\" is frequently re-evaluated. Skills listed in the \"Table\" may have their difficulty ratings raised or lowered after evaluation by the FIG Technical Committee. In addition, skills that are determined to be too dangerous to the athletes may be banned outright, for example roll-out skills like the Thomas Salto. The Technical Committee may also give specific hazardous skills artificially low difficulty ratings to deter gymnasts from trying to compete them, such as the \"Biles\" on balance beam and also \"Produnova\" on women's vault, which were assigned a D-score of H (0.8) to the beam skill and 6.4 to the vault skill. The former is a double-twisting double back tucked somersault dismount, and latter is a front handspring double front somersault. The \"Biles\" on balance beam was originated by American Simone Biles at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, and that skill's D-score assignment of H (0.8), which the FIG has defended their somewhat underscored difficulty value of the \"Biles\" on balance beam by explaining that due to the extremely high risks of causing injury associated when training and/or performing this skill, they as the governing body have the responsibility of trying keep gymnasts safe. The D-scores for skills deemed unnecessarily risky have been set to a somewhat lower value than they truly deserve in order to discourage gymnasts who are not technically or physically ready from attempting them. The \"Produnova\" on vault has been long considered the most difficult vault ever to be successfully completed by women. Only five women have ever successfully/officially landed the skill and earn a score in competition, and its originator, Elena Produnova of Russia, the only woman who managed to first stick the vault on landing at the 1999 University Games in Moscow when it was first unveiled to the world—the vault was later officially verified for its successful completion by the FIG at the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. However, its difficulty value has been steadily decreasing over the years even though still no additional women have been able to land the skill safely or moreover officially attempted the skill in competition for many years now. This vault at one time had a D-score of 7.1, then to 7.0, and later to just 6.4 now, which is now equal to the D-score of the \"Biles\" on vault—technically a Yurchenko half twist onto vaulting platform and then into a double twist off it after (or again a “½ on–2/1 off” in practice). Even with the same D-score, many still see the \"Produnova\" as being underscored again due to the FIG openly acknowledging deliberately scoring lower of certain proportionately riskier skills such as this one in order to discourage gymnasts selecting and/or training such skills for competition.\nMany of the skills in the \"Table of Elements\" are named after gymnasts. An original element is named after an athlete when he or she is the first person to successfully perform it at an official FIG event, such as a World Championships, an Olympics, or a FIG World Cup. Gymnasts and their coaches must submit their original skill to the FIG before the meet for evaluation and possible inclusion in the \"Table of Elements\".\nJudging and score tabulation.\nTwo panels of judges evaluate each performance. One evaluates the difficulty and other evaluates execution. The final mark is the combined total of these two scores.\nThe D-score (or difficulty score) indicates the difficulty of the exercise on three criteria: \nThe D-score judging panel does not take deductions. However, they may decide not to award points for elements that are performed incorrectly or not completed. They may also decide not to award connection value points if there are extra steps or pauses between skills that are meant to be connected.\nThere is no upper limit on the D-score.\nThe E-score (or execution score) evaluates the execution and artistry of the routine.\nThe D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.\nScoring for vault is somewhat different:\nAs with other apparatus, the D-score and E-score are added together for the gymnast's final mark.\nThere are several acts that completely invalidate the vault and result in a score of 0. These include receiving spotting (assistance) from a coach, going before the signal and not using the U-shaped safety mat for Yurchenko-style vaults.\nAn inquiry into a gymnast's score can be initiated if it was felt that the score was too low. Only the D-score can be contested, however.\nPre-2006 Code.\nSkills: Every acrobatic and dance element was awarded a specific difficulty rating, ranging from A (easiest) to “Super E” (hardest) in the \"Table of Elements\". A gymnast earned bonus points by performing difficult skills alone or in combination.\nRequired elements: Routine composition was decided by the gymnast and his or her coaches, however, on every apparatus except vault there was a list of required elements (similar to the EGR in the new \"Code\") that had to be performed during the routine. Examples of required elements included 360 degree turns on balance beam and a backwards salto (somersault) on floor exercise.\nBase score: The base score was the default Start Value of the routine, provided the gymnast fulfilled all required elements. This changed over the years and tended to lower as the codes went on. For instance, for the 1992-1996 code, a base score of 9.4 was awarded if all of the basic elements were fulfilled. For the 1996-2000 code, the base score was a 9.0. Finally, a base score of 8.8 was awarded for the 2000-2004 Olympic years. Before the new code, the base score again dropped to an 8.6 but this was not adopted for a very long time (only 2005-2006).\nStart Value: The Start Value (SV) of each routine was determined by adding the base score to the bonus points earned from performing difficult elements and combinations. Ideally, a gymnast wanted to have an SV as close to 10.0 as possible.\nOn vault, every vault was assigned a specific Start Value in the \"Code\".\nThe score was determined by subtracting any deductions for poor form, execution, steps, falls or other infractions from the SV."

        "title": "Speed sailing",
        "text": "Speed sailing is the art of sailing a craft as fast as possible over a predetermined route, and having its overall or peak speed recorded and accredited by a regulatory body. The term usually refers to sailing on water, even though sailing on land and ice is progressively faster because of the lower friction involved. The World Sailing Speed Record Council is the body authorized by the World Sailing to confirm speed records of sailing craft (boats or sailboards) on water (not on ice or land).\nSailing craft used.\nThe craft used vary from single sailor windsurfers or kitesurfers, to multi-hulls with crews of fifteen people. Many short course record attempts are made with boats based on the classic proa boat layout. Recent developments include hulls that rely on hydrofoils or planing hulls, which allow the hull to lift out of the water, and thereby increases speed by reducing friction. An example of a multihull hydrofoil design is the Hydroptère, designed by Alain Thébault. The design is based on experience from a range of hydrofoil sailcraft that Thébault built in cooperation with the late Eric Tabarly since the 1990s. On 4 September 2009, l’Hydroptère broke the world record, sustaining a speed of 51.36 knots for 500m in 30 knots of wind. On 24 November 2012, Vestas Sailrocket 2 raised the bar to 65.45 knots, a record which still stands.\nThroughout the 1970s, the speed sailing 500 meter and Nautical Mile records were dominated by large multihulls, as typified by the Crossbow and Crossbow II of Timothy Colman. This has changed since to smaller, very lightweight boats. The Yellow Pages Endeavour, a highly optimized one-way proa design using a rigid wingsail lost its decade old 1993 500m record to a windsurfer in 2004. This was followed by frequently changing records, with windsurfers holding the record through 2008, when it was taken by a succession of kitesurfers. In 2009, in a radical shift away from the tiny surfboard based craft, the trimaran Hydroptère, with a length of 18.28 meters and a displacement of 6.5 metric tons, took the 500m speed record back for the D class boats.\nWindsurfing.\nAntoine Albeau holds the windsurfing speed record (on the 500-metre course) with a speed of 53.27 knots (2015, Lüderitz speed canal, Namibia, beating his own previous record of 49.09 knots (90,91 km/h) from 2008, on the purpose built Saintes Marie de la Mer canal in Southern France. The previous record of 48.7 knots (90,19 km/h) was held by Finian Maynard, an Irish born windsurfer who sails for the British Virgin Islands who achieved this speed on 10 April 2005 on the same purpose-built canal. Between 1988 and 2009, A total of 8 Outright Sailing Speed Records were set on The Canal in Saintes Marie De la Mer starting with the first outright record above 40 knots by British speed windsurfer Erik Beale at 40.48 knots, 1988 and subsequent records by Pascal Maka, 42.91 knots, 1990; Thierry Bielak, 45.34, 1993; Finian Maynard 48.70, 2008 and finally Antoine Albeau 49.09, 2009. Windsurfers are not as efficient as the larger boats used in record attempts. Albeau's 49.09 knot record was set in winds of 45 to 50 knots, while the Yellow Pages Endeavour, which held a record of 46.52 knots from 1993 to 2004, was optimized to sail in a 19 knot wind. Venue has much to do with the windsurfer's success, as all windsurfing 500m records since 1988 have been made at the same canal. Zara Davis holds the outright nautical mile record for a woman, set in Walvis Bay Namibia, an open water venue, in November 2006. The previous record was held by Valerie Ghibaudo of France\nKitesurfing.\nFrenchman kitesurfer Sebastien Cattelan became the first sailor to break the 50 knots barrier with 50.26 knots on 3 October 2008 at the Lüderitz Speed Challenge in Namibia. On 4 October 2008 Frenchman Alex Caizergues, also using a kite, broke this record with a 50.57 knots run. Earlier in the event, on 19 September, kitesurfer Rob Douglas (United States) made a 49.84 knots (92.30 km/h) run, becoming the first kitesurfer to establish an outright speed sailing world record – held until that date only by sailboats or windsurfers. Douglas also became the world's third over-50 knots sailor,\nwhen on 8 September he made a 50.54 knots (93.60 km/h) run. The current speed record over a 500 meter (1,640 ft) course for a kiteboard, officially ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council, is 55.65 kn, held by Robert Douglas, and set in Luderitz, Namibia in October 2010.\nThe WSSRC Nautical Mile record for kitesurfing was originally set in Walvis Bay, Namibia in 2005 by Dirk Hanel (GER) at 35.44 kn, and broken again in 2006 by Rob Munro (GB) at Walvis Bay, 35.65 kn. Munro remains the current world speedsailing record holder for kitesurfing over the nautical mile. Aurelia Herpin (FRA) holds the women's record of 29.83 kn.\nLongest distance run in 24 hours.\nThe records for the longest distance sailed within 24 hours are also recorded by the WSSRC. There are different categories:\nThe class VO70 has proven itself to be the fastest distance monohull sailboat class ever built. Today all major distance monohull records are established by VO70's. For example, in October 2008 the yacht Ericsson 4 officially travelled 596.6 nautical miles in 24 hours, establishing a 24-hour monohull record. Skipper Torben Grael and his crew made the record on the first leg of the 2008-2009 Volvo Ocean Race. They sailed Ericsson 4 hard as a strong cold front hit the fleet, bringing winds approaching 40 knots, and propelling the yacht at an average speed of 24.8 knots."

        "text": "Benetton Rugby, also known as Benetton Treviso ( or ), is an Italian professional rugby union team based in Treviso, Veneto competing in the United Rugby Championship, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and European Champions Cup. Treviso rugby team was founded in 1932 and has won 15 Italian national championships. The team has been owned by the Benetton clothing company since 1979. Treviso have competed in the United Rugby Championship (formerly the Pro14 and Pro12) since 2010, and have previously competed in the Italian domestic championship.\nTreviso have supplied many players to the Italian national team, such as Alessandro Zanni and Leonardo Ghiraldini. Conversely, several notable foreign internationals have played for Treviso, including Rugby World Cup winners Craig Green, John Kirwan and Michael Lynagh. The President of Treviso Rugby is Amerino Zatta. Since 1982, the club has also had a women's team, known as \"Red Panthers\", which has won 16 national championships.\nHistory.\nAmateur era: 1932–1995.\nTreviso rugby team was founded in 1932. The club won its first honour when it took the 1956 Italian premiership. Benetton Treviso won its first Italian Cup in 1970 and in 1978 won the Italian premiership again. The year after Benetton became the main sponsor, the team's name became \"Benetton Rugby Treviso\". Treviso won the domestic premiership in 1983, then again in 1989 and in the 1992 season.\nProfessional era: 1995–present.\nBenetton Treviso Rugby turned professional after 1995. They dominated the Italian league from 1997 until 2010, winning the championship 10 times (1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010) during those 14 seasons and twice finishing second. They also won the Italian Cup in 1998.\nBenetton Treviso has competed in the Heineken Cup competition almost every year since the competition began in 1995 along with the professional era. Benetton Treviso competed in the inaugural 1995–96 Heineken Cup, winning one game and losing one. The following season they played four matches, winning one game. In the 1998–99 Heineken Cup, they won three games. Benetton Treviso spent the 2000–01 and 2002–03 seasons in the European Challenge Cup, but have appeared in the Heineken Cup in each season since then. They won half of their games during the 2004–05 Heineken Cup, but won only one match in the following four seasons (at Newport Gwent Dragons in 2007). In the 2009–10 Heineken Cup opener, they defeated reigning French Top 14 champions Perpignan 9–8 in Treviso.\nFollowing the 2009–10 season, Treviso left the Italian domestic competition and in 2010–11 was one of two Italian teams to join the Celtic League to play against clubs from Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The new league was to be known as the Pro12. Both Italian teams were guaranteed places annually into the Heineken Cup, which had previously been awarded to the two top teams in the domestic Italian National Championship of Excellence. An agreement had been reached in early March 2010 to allow two Italian teams a place in the Celtic League. In 2010, it was proposed that Aironi and a new team, Praetorians Roma, would join, but Treviso were nominated instead. Treviso and a combination of Duchi Nord-Ovest rugby clubs could not agree to form one regional representative club and lost out in the first round of bidding. However, Pretorians Roma failed to satisfy financial criteria, and Treviso instead joined the Pro12.\nTreviso finished their first two season in the Pro12 (2010–11 and 2011–12) in 10th place, while in the 2012–13 season they finished 7th with 50 points. In the next three seasons, Treviso performed poorly, ending 11th, 11th and 12th out of twelve teams.\nAfter that, a new head coach was engaged for the 2016/2017 season, the New Zealander Kieran Crowley. The former All Black formed a new coaching team with two ex-Italian internationals, Marco Bortolami and Fabio Ongaro. Treviso finished the season in 10th place.\nIn 2017/2018, the championship was joined by two South Africans teams, becoming the Pro14, and was divided into two conferences. This season Treviso nearly reached the European Rugby Champions Cup play-offs, ending 5th in the conference with 55 points. For first time since Treviso joined this league the club has been able to record more wins than losses (11 against 10).\nAhead of the 2017/18 season, Benetton Rugby Treviso was renamed Benetton Rugby. From 2022/23 season, he instituted an Academy Under 23 and a territorial Academy Under 19.\nStadium.\nThe team play at the Stadio Comunale di Monigo in Treviso, 4 km northwest of the city centre. The stadium has two covered stands and a capacity of 5,000.\nStaff and coaching team.\nThe staff for the 2023–24 season is: \nSelected former players.\nItalian players.\nFormer players who have played for Benetton and have caps for Italy\nOverseas players.\nFormer players who have played for Benetton and have caps for their Representative Team\nI Dogi.\nTreviso is an executive member of the historical territorial representative of I Dogi (the Doges) that have recovered in 2015 and represents several clubs in Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Currently no provision is made for a selection Seniors who take the field with the shirt of \"The Doges\": to represent its brand and colors are at this stage the representative under-14, under-16 male and female under-18 male and female managed by Veneto Regional Committee. May occur during the right conditions, there is still the desire to be able to field, even if it is currently not a priority.\nIn the past, Dogi was a historical invitational team that included the best players of Triveneto, area of Italy in which this sport is very widespread. The team was founded on 17 December 1973 in Treviso, and played its last game on 17 November 1993. In twenty years they played 22 games with teams of international level, collecting 15 victories.

The club was established in 1970, and has since won the Italian championship in 2002, and the Coppa Italia three times. They also compete in European rugby competitions and were runners-up in the European Shield in 2004. Viadana plays in yellow and black. The club did not compete professionally between 2010 and 2012 as they focused their efforts on Aironi. Aironi was based at Viadana's home ground and represented a number of regional teams in the multi-national Celtic League. The FIR withdrew Aironi's licence to play at the end of the 2012, so Viadana reformed as a professional team will play in Italy's top division, the National championship of Excellence, from the 2012–13 season and currently in the Top12.\nHistory.\nThey were founded in 1970 as a rugby sector in the Vitellianense Cebogas Multisports Club by some ex Rugby Parma F.C. players. They started in the lowest possible league, Serie D.\nIn 1980–81 Viadana won Serie B but after three years the team were relegated back to Serie C. But they bounced back the following year and won promotion back to Serie B. 1986–87 they won promotion to Serie A2 and finished sixth in their first year. However they were relegated back the following year and didn't return for three years.\nThey finally won promotion to Serie A in 1998–99. In their first season Arix Viadana won the Coppa Italia and made it to the semifinal of the playoffs. In 2000–01 they finished third in the league but again lost in the semifinal playoffs to Benetton Treviso.\nIn 2002 the Italian championship was reformed with the birth of Super 10 (now Top12). During this season Arix Viadana finished first and beat favourites Benetton Treviso, in the playoffs, and Calvisano, in the final, to win the title of Italian champion for the first time. They were the first team from outside a provincial capital to do so. They won the Coppa Italia a second time in 2003.\nIn 2004 they became the first Italian team to have made the final of a European competition when they lost the European Shield final 19–25 to Montpellier. In 2007 they defeated Cammi Calvisano to win their third Coppa Italia. In 2008, despite their relatively experienced team, Viadana were beaten in the semifinals by Benetton Treviso and subsequently lost out on a lucrative Heineken Cup place. In the 2008–09 and 2009–10 Super 10 seasons Montepaschi Viadana reaches the final championship, losing both times against Benetton Treviso.\nViadana were the largest shareholders in Aironi, a new team that competed in the 2010–11 and 2012–12 Celtic League. Many of the club's top players joined Aironi on its formation. As of June 2010 it was announced that will the impending establishment of Aironi the club would no longer compete as a professional club. The Senior and Under 20 teams would be merged with GranDucato Parma Rugby. Viadana would continue as an independent club but only below Under 20 level.\nAt the end of the 2012 Aironi's licence to play in the Pro12 was withdrawn by the FIR. Aironi's place in the Pro12 was taken by newly formed Zebre, a team based in Parma. Many Aironi players joined Zebre on its formation.\nViadana was then reformed as a semi-professional team for the 2012–13 season of the National championship of Excellence, the reformed Italian championship from 2010, with a number of Aironi's players joining them, as well as the head coach Rowland Phillips. They won three titles of the Excellence Trophy in the 2012–13, 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons.\nThe 2012–13 was the last season of Silvano Melegari, and of the Arix Group, as president of the club, after 20 years of history.

It reached its peak in the 1937–38 season when, after Tommaso Fattori, a legendary figure for the history of the club (the stadium of L'Aquila, Stadio Tommaso Fattori is named after him), joined the team, the club won the local tournament qualifying for the final one, where it finished the season fourth out of 54 participants. It first played in a championship in 1948.\nIn 1949–50 L'Aquila participated in the Serie B and were in contention for promotion to Serie A up to the final game of the season, Genoa eventually winning out. The following year the team won promotion to the Serie A then the highest division in Italy. In 1958–59 they were losing finalists in the Serie A Grand Final. In 1963–64 they were relegated to Serie B, but returned to Serie A the following year. They won their first title in 1967 defeating Fiamme Oro Padova 6 to 0.

        "title": "List of Super Bowl halftime shows",
        "text": "Halftime shows are a tradition during American football games at all levels of competition. Entertainment during the Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), represents a fundamental link to pop culture, which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest.\nBackground.\nDuring most of the Super Bowl's first decade (starting on January 15, 1967), the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game, saw the introduction of popular music acts, starting with Michael Jackson in 1993, including New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett.\nStarting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme—begun with Super Bowl III—ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows\".\nSince Super Bowl XLV, the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.\nThe NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members, management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends. The Super Bowl XXVII halftime show with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and Frito-Lay agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's Heal the World Foundation. According to Nielsen SoundScan data, the halftime performers regularly experience significant spikes in weekly album sales and paid digital downloads due to the exposure. For Super Bowl XLIX, it was reported by the \"Wall Street Journal\" that league officials asked representatives of potential acts if they would be willing to provide financial compensation to the NFL in exchange for their appearance, in the form of either an up-front fee, or a cut of revenue from concert performances made after the Super Bowl. While these reports were denied by an NFL spokeswoman, the request had, according to the \"Journal\", received a \"chilly\" response from those involved.\nHistory.\nThe following is a list of the performers, producers, themes, and sponsors for each Super Bowl game's show. This list does not include national anthem performers, which are listed in the article List of national anthem performers at the Super Bowl. Names in bold are headline performers.\nDetails on specific shows.\nSuper Bowl XL.\nFor the Rolling Stones, the stage was in the form of the group's iconic tongue logo (John Pasche's design first used in 1971 on their \"Sticky Fingers\" album). It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: \"Start Me Up\", \"Rough Justice\", and \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined. In the wake of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, ABC and the NFL imposed a five-second delay and censored lyrics considered too sexually explicit in the first two songs by briefly turning off Mick Jagger's microphone—censoring to which the group had previously agreed.\nHowever, the choice of the Rolling Stones sparked controversy in the Detroit community because the band did not represent the traditional Detroit \"Motown Sound\", and no artists from the area were included."

        "title": "David Bauer (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Father David William Bauer (November 2, 1924November 9, 1988) was a Canadian ice hockey player and coach, educator and Catholic priest. He was offered a playing contract by the Boston Bruins at age 15, but declined on the advice of his father to complete a proper education. The experience of not pursuing his dream of playing professional hockey was traumatic for Bauer, who then committed himself to look for more meaning in life and play a role in world peace. After he served as captain of the Toronto St. Michael's Majors for two seasons and won the 1944 Memorial Cup, he became ordained as a Catholic priest in the Congregation of St. Basil and taught at St. Michael's College School. He coached multiple levels of hockey at St. Michael's, sat on the junior ice hockey council for the Ontario Hockey Association, lobbied for a shortened playing schedule for students athletes, and coached the St. Michael's Majors to victory in the 1961 Memorial Cup. Bauer was reassigned to St. Mark's College at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1961, then coached the UBC Thunderbirds for two seasons and led them to the finals at the 1963 CIAU University Cup.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association approved a proposal by Bauer to have a team of Canadian university students combined with senior ice hockey players to represent Canada in ice hockey at the Olympics and at the Ice Hockey World Championships; which was a radical change from the existing practice of the reigning Allan Cup champion team being selected. He established the Canada men's national ice hockey team program in September 1963, and sought players with athletic and academic morals committed to their studies and training. He prepared the players for the larger international ice hockey rink surface and differences from the North American ice hockey rules, and intended to change Canada's reputation of being heavily penalized for rough play. Canada finished in fourth place based on goal differential at the 1964 Winter Olympics, amidst accusations that International Ice Hockey Federation president Bunny Ahearne made a last-minute change to the tie-breaking rules to take away a medal from Canada. Bauer transitioned into managing the national team when the program relocated to Winnipeg in 1965, and assembled teams that won the bronze medal at the 1966 and 1967 World Championships, and the 1968 Winter Olympics. He later managed the national team which finished in sixth place at the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nWhen Canada withdrew from international play during the 1970s, Bauer instructed at hockey schools in Japan for two six-week periods each year, where his teachings on personal growth and discipline fit into the culture of Japan. He also coached the Austria men's national ice hockey team during the 1973 Ice Hockey World Championships. Throughout his career, he felt that hockey was a means to teach the game of life and way for boys to become men. He advocated for players receiving an education and was opposed to the growing professionalism in the amateur game. Bauer received many honours, which included induction into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, the Hockey Hall of Fame, the IIHF Hall of Fame and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. He was made an officer of the Order of Canada, and is the namesake of the Father Bauer Arena and the Father David Bauer Olympic Arena, both of which are used by Canada for international hockey.\nEarly life and family.\nDavid William Bauer was born on November 2, 1924, in Waterloo, Ontario. His great-grandparents had emigrated from Bavaria to Waterloo via Buffalo, New York. His father Sir Edgar J. Bauer was an automotive supplies manufacturer and a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Sylvester. Edgar Bauer also served as president of Globe Furniture and the Waterloo Fire Insurance Company, and sat on the Waterloo City Council and the public utilities commission. His mother Alice Bertha Hayes was active in the Catholic Women's League of Canada and a member of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Guild.\nBauer was the youngest of 11 children and had five brothers and five sisters. He attended St. Louis Separate School as a youth followed by three years at St. Jerome's College School. As a youth, Bauer played pond hockey in Victoria Park with friends who included Howie Meeker and George Hainsworth Jr. The Bauers later had an ice rink constructed at their house, including side boards, painted lines and floodlights.\nAll of Bauer's brothers played ice hockey and won a league championship. Bobby Bauer won two Stanley Cups playing for the Boston Bruins. Bobby and Frank won the 1934 Memorial Cup playing for the Toronto St. Michael's Majors. Eugene won a league championship with the Kitchener Greenshirts in 1935. Jerry and Ray won a league championship with the Waterloo Siskins in 1940.\nStudent life and playing career.\nBauer aspired to play in the National Hockey League (NHL) and attended training camp for the Boston Bruins held in Hershey, Pennsylvania in October 1941. The highest level of hockey he had played at the time was as a centreman for his school team. He was offered a contract to play for the Boston Olympics, a farm team for the Bruins. His father insisted his son was too young for professional hockey, and that he should first complete a proper education. Bauer later stated that it was a traumatic experience for him not to pursue his dream of playing professional hockey, which had resulted in him looking for something more in life.\nBauer returned to Waterloo for another year at St. Jerome's, then followed in the footsteps of his brothers Frank and Bobby when he enrolled at St. Michael's College School to play hockey. Bauer served as team captain of the Toronto St. Michael's Majors for two seasons from 1942 to 1944. He excelled as a student, played as a left winger, and was considered a gentlemanly player and a role model by his teammates. During the summer between grades 11 and 12, Bauer returned home and was a pitcher in a senior baseball league in Waterloo.\nBauer and the Majors were finalists for the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1943–44 season, but lost to the Oshawa Generals. Wartime replacement rules allowed the Generals to add up to four players from the Majors in the remainder of the playoffs. Bauer played for the Generals team which won the Eastern Canada championship and then won the 1944 Memorial Cup to become Canadian junior champions. Bauer scored four goals and five assists during the championship series for the Generals.\nBauer received two varsity letters for athletics at St. Michael's College School. He also played golf, tennis, baseball and was the quarterback on the for St. Michael's football team. The school had an undefeated football season in his senior year.\nBauer played one final game for the Majors in the 1944–45 season, shortly before he enlisted in the Canadian Army on November 24, 1944, and assigned to Basic Training Unit 12 in Chatham, Ontario. All of his brothers completed military service during World War II; Bobby and Ray were in the Royal Canadian Air Force, Jerry was in the Royal Canadian Navy, and Frank, Eugene and Dave were in the Canadian Army. While serving with the army, Bauer played hockey for the Royal Canadian Postal Corps in the Ottawa National Defence Hockey League and then briefly with the Windsor Spitfires in the Windsor City Hockey League. He enrolled at the University of Toronto upon release from the Army. His playing career ended with the University of Toronto Varsity Blues during the 1945–46 season after he began studies for priesthood.\nPlaying statistics.\nRegular season and playoffs statistics.\nEntering the priesthood.\nBauer went to Richmond Hill in 1946, and entered the novitiate for the Congregation of St. Basil to study for the priesthood, then took his religious vows on September 12, 1947. He returned to the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto to complete undergraduate studies and earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1949. His influences as a student included philosopher Jacques Maritain and writer Christopher Dawson. Bauer earned his teaching certificate from the Ontario College of Education in 1951.\nIn 1952, the Bauer family was a major contributor towards funding and establishing the Carmel of St. Joseph Monastery in St. Agatha near Waterloo. Bauer was ordained as a Catholic priest on June 29, 1953, at St. Basil's Church in Toronto by Cardinal James McGuigan. Bauer conducted his first mass as a priest at St. Jerome's Roman Catholic Church in Waterloo in 1953.\nSt. Michael's teacher and coach.\nBauer taught at St. Michael's College School from 1953 to 1961, and sought for the education system to produce more wise leaders. The school was operated by the Basilian fathers. Their motto, \"Teach me goodness, discipline and knowledge\" was derived from Psalm 119. Bauer taught ethics, religion, theology and history, while coaching the hockey and football programs. In January 1957, he was named assistant principal of St. Michael's.\nBauer sat on the junior ice hockey council for the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), and coached and managed teams at all levels of hockey offered by St. Michael's. He protected his players against the advances of professional teams that tried to sign junior-aged players to contracts, and felt that the players needed more time to develop. He and the Basilian fathers lobbied for a shortened schedule for the Toronto St. Michael's Majors in the OHA's top tier of junior hockey after the 1958–59 season, since they believed it was too long and detrimental to academic studies for their students.\nBob Goldham resigned as head coach of the Majors in 1960, and Bauer took over as head coach for the 1960–61 OHA season in addition to his role as general manager. He stressed fundamentals of defensive play without the puck and taught players how to absorb contact without getting hurt. He occasionally had his players switch positions with one another to learn an appreciation of their teammate's contributions. The Majors finished in second place during the season, then defeated the Guelph Royals in the playoffs for the OHA championship. The Majors won the Eastern Canada final defeating the Moncton Beavers then travelled to Edmonton to play in the 1961 Memorial Cup. The Majors defeated the Edmonton Oil Kings in six games and won the school's fourth Memorial Cup.\nThe Basilian fathers again discussed the length of the season and the amount of travel having an effect on academics. They were also concerned with increasing physical play and growing similarities with professional leagues. The Majors had played 98 games including the regular season and playoffs for the Memorial Cup. St. Michael's could no longer justify participation in the top tier of the OHA and chose to withdraw from the Ontario Hockey Association Junior A series. Bauer stated in a 1987 interview that, \"We regretted very much leaving because we knew that this [school] is a major recreational institution in this country\".\nAfter the official announcement on June 6, 1961, Bauer placed his protégé Jim Gregory in charge of the team. The Majors operated for one more season and played a shortened 33-game schedule in the Metro Junior A League for the 1961–62 OHA season. The team was transferred to Neil McNeil High School and became known as the Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons in 1962.\nSt. Mark's and the Thunderbirds.\nThe Basilian fathers reassigned Bauer to St. Mark's College at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1961. He taught ethics to nurses at the college, and served as the dean of residence and the chaplain at St. Paul's Hospital.\nPrior to Bauer's arrival at St. Mark's, he received a letter from the university's athletics department asking him to coach the UBC Thunderbirds which played in the Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association. He agreed to assist the coach for the 1961–62 season, but was initially reluctant to do more. Players on the Thunderbirds wanted to get rid of coach Al Stuart and Bauer agreed to take over in January 1962, after persistent requests by the players and meetings with the UBC athletic director.\nAfter it was announced the Bauer was coaching, more players wanted to join the team in addition to Bauer beginning a recruitment program across Canada. UBC physical education teacher Bob Hindmarch became general manager of the Thunderbirds and made the financial and academic arrangements for the players to get to Vancouver. The university had no rink of its own at the time, and used Kerrisdale Arena or the North Shore Winter Club's curling rink for practice, with games played at the Vancouver Forum. Bauer taught a defense first mentality to his team which was not the most skilled, and cancelled practices as needed to allow his players to catch up academically. The Thunderbirds won two exhibition games, but were winless in league games during the season.\nIn the 1962–63 season, 120 players came to training camp for the Thunderbirds. Bauer selected the best skaters for the team, and arranged for exhibition games versus senior ice hockey teams in British Columbia. The Thunderbirds combined with players from the Toronto Marlboros to play an exhibition game versus the Soviet Union national ice hockey team, but lost by a 6–0 score. The Thunderbirds had an annual rivalry with the Alberta Golden Bears for the Hamber Cup, which they had never won since the trophy was established in 1950. The Thunderbirds won their first Hamber cup in a two-game series including a 3–2 overtime loss and a 3–1 victory. Bauer led the Thunderbirds to eight wins, one loss and one tie in the regular season to win the Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association title, and qualify for the national championship. The Thunderbirds reached the final game of the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union men's ice hockey championship tournament in Kingston, Ontario. They lost the championship game for the CIAU University Cup by a 3–2 score to the McMaster Marauders, who scored the winning goal scored on a power play resulting from a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty.\nDuring the season, Bauer worked with Vancouver alderman Frank Fredrickson, to secure C$500,000 in funding necessary to build a new arena. The Thunderbird Sports Centre opened in September 1963.\nInternational ice hockey.\nNational team proposal.\nBauer and his brother Ray attended the 1962 Ice Hockey World Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which was the first time North America hosted the World Championships. The Bauer family had a history of international competition. Ray Bauer represented Canada at the 1949 Ice Hockey World Championships as a member of the Sudbury Wolves, and Bobby Bauer coached the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen at the 1956 Winter Olympics and the 1960 Winter Olympics.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) annually chose an amateur senior team to represent the country at international competitions, which was usually the reigning Allan Cup champion team since it met the amateur eligibility requirements for the ice hockey at the Olympic Games and the Ice Hockey World Championships. When the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen represented Canada, Ray Bauer funded expenses for the team through the family business, since the Government of Canada declined to provide funding and the CAHA did not cover all of the travel expenses. The Bauers felt it was unfair for one city to pay most of the expenses to send a team to represent the whole country. Bauer spoke with American coaches during the World Championships, and learned of their detailed preparation plans for the 1964 Winter Olympics, whereas Canada did not yet know which team would represent the country.\nBauer suggested it might be time for Canadian universities and colleges to represent the country since they met amateur eligibility requirements, and he felt there were young men who would be interested in a program which combined education and hockey. He felt that a core group of students could be reinforced with the best available Canadian senior players for international competition. He discussed the concept with CAHA president Jack Roxburgh and secretary Gordon Juckes who were also in attendance at the World Championships, and was invited make a presentation at the next CAHA annual meeting in May 1962. Bauer's proposal was unanimously endorsed in principle at the general meeting, then given final approval at the CAHA executive meeting in August 1962, with partial funding provided towards board and tuition. The Canadian Olympic Association gave its approval to the proposal in October 1962.\nThe proposal was opposed by professional leagues including the NHL who would be competing for the same players. University of Alberta physical education director Maury Van Vliet, criticized the idea in a letter to the newspapers, and felt that the CAHA was letting Bauer assemble an all-star team at \"a university that does not own a rink, located in an area that has never produced a hockey player, with a team that has never beaten anyone\". When the CAHA approved the plan with only 20 minutes of discussion, journalist Trent Frayne stated that \"Father Bauer is the greatest lobbyist in the history of hockey\". Journalist Scott Young wrote that it was the best hockey news in Canada in years and should be given a chance. Journalist Jim Coleman reported that consensus at the time was \"for Canada to embark on a radical new course\", even if it included establishing a team of university students to represent Canada at international hockey events.\nNational team development.\nBauer and UBC officials met with the CAHA in January 1963 and reached a financial agreement for the new team. Bauer began the national team program in September 1963. He recruited Bob Hindmarch to be the team's general manager and assistant coach, and Dennis Selder took over coaching duties of the UBC Thunderbirds.\nBauer sought players with athletic and academic morals committed to their studies and training. He prepared the players for the larger international ice hockey rink surface, and differences from the North American ice hockey rules where body checking was limited to a team's defensive zone. He intended to change Canada's reputation in Europe of being heavily penalized for rough play and frequently criticized for hooliganism on ice.\nBauer kept a regular schedule for the team which attended classes in the day time, practiced late in the afternoon, and studied later in the evening. Most of the team lived on the Point Grey campus of the University of British Columbia in a house which had previously been a transmitter station during World War II. The close-knit atmosphere promoting team bonding, as did a group effort to fix and renovate the house. Bauer recruited a German housekeeper named Ma Byers from a local restaurant in Vancouver to cook and act as a mother figure to the players.\nBauer searched for funding from Canadian businesses, and received donations from Max Bell, Charles Hay and James A. Richardson. The team was assisted by Canadian Pacific Railway president Ian Sinclair, who arranged for free or discounted transportation for the team. Bauer's mother and brothers contributed funds through the family business, and the Government of Canada's Fitness Council later contributed after Montreal journalist Andy O'Brien wrote about the players being starving scholar athletes. Bauer also arranged for the national team players to give back to the community in exchange for better funding from politicians.\nBauer's national team played its first game wearing Canadian jerseys on November 12, 1963, in an exhibition win versus the Melville Millionaires. The national team went on to play 33 exhibition games across Canada in preparation for the Olympics.\n1964 Winter Olympic Games.\nIce hockey at the 1964 Winter Olympics was played from January 27 to February 9 at Innsbruck, Austria. Canada won its qualification game by a 14–1 score over Yugoslavia to be seeded in Group A. Bauer's team followed with an 8–0 win over Switzerland, a 4–2 win over Germany, a 6–2 win over Finland, and an 8–6 win over the United States. During the game versus Sweden, opposing player Carl-Göran Öberg broke his stick and tossed it aside. The broken end of the stick went towards the Canadian players' bench, where it struck Bauer in the face and opened a bleeding wound. Bauer demanded for his players to remain on the bench and not retaliate, since he did not want to take penalties late in the game. Canada went on to win by a 3–1 score, and Bauer forgave Öberg for the incident. On the next day, Bauer invited Öberg to sit with him while watching the Soviet Union play Czechoslovakia. Canada lost the final two games of the Olympics by a 3–1 score to Czechoslovakia, and by a 3–2 to the Soviet Union after Canada held a 2–1 advantage in the second period.\nBased on his understanding of the tie-breaking procedure, Bauer's philosophy was to simply win the games against the weaker countries instead of running up the score. Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden finished with identical records of five wins and two losses. Canada thought they had won the bronze medal based on the goal differential in the three games among the tied countries. When they attended the presentation of the Olympic medals, they were disappointed to learn they had finished in fourth place based on goal differential of all seven games played. The players and CAHA president Art Potter accused that International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) president Bunny Ahearne, made a last-minute decision to change the rules and take away a medal from Canada. Bauer was one of only three Canadians who attended the medal ceremony, where he was awarded a gold medal for his example of good sportsmanship in the stick-throwing incident. Later that night, the players gathered in Bauer's room where Marshall Johnston summarized the team's feeling that, \"The shepherd and his flock have been fleeced\".\nThe national team played an exhibition tour in Europe after the Olympics then had an audience with Pope Paul VI in the Vatican City on February 15, 1964. When Bauer returned to Canada, he met with the CAHA to discuss the negative academic impact of the national team. He felt that the players had been capable students who were aware of the academic sacrifices in advance, but that representing Canada had been more important to them than their studies. Despite that seven of the players had dropped out of their courses and nine others completed less than half of their courses, Bauer felt it possible to find other methods to prevent academic impacts for the students on the national team.\nAt the CAHA general meeting in May 1964, Ahearne clarified that the decision to place Canada fourth in the standings was supported by the IIHF statutes and that no rules were changed. Former CAHA president and past IIHF president Robert Lebel agreed that the correct decision was made despite the accusations. At the same meeting, Bauer was given approval to continue the national team program and transitioned from coaching into a managing and advisory role.\nNational team from 1965 to 1969.\nBauer travelled with the team regularly on international tours during the late 1960s. He attracted a following as a priest in Europe, and conducted mass at various locations including motels with a portable altar, a chapel within the Embassy of France in Moscow, churches in Prague and houses of his friends. While in Austria he conducted mass on several occasions at the Mariatrost Basilica, a noted pilgrimage site in Graz.\nThe CAHA merged the national team into the Winnipeg Maroons in 1965, and relocated the program to a new home base in Winnipeg. The Maroons were one of the best senior ice hockey teams in Canada at the time, and their coach Gord Simpson continued in the same role for the national team. Players on the team attending UBC were transferred to the University of Manitoba, and Bauer continued his recruitments efforts. He saw the merger as the beginning of a truly national team based in the geographic centre of the country.\nBauer assembled a mix of veteran and student players for the 1965 Ice Hockey World Championships. Canada finished in fourth place with four wins in seven games. He was satisfied with the result since the team had only been together for three weeks, but he felt it would be difficult for Canada to win the World Championships within the next five years. Bauer conferred with CAHA president Lionel Fleury, and discussed the merits of skipping the next World Championships to regroup and give the players more time to develop as a team.\nAfter the CAHA made an unsuccessful bid to host the Ice Hockey World Championships as part of the Canadian Centennial celebrations in 1967, Bauer hoped that the rejection of the bid would inspire more support from the Government of Canada and the Canadian public to restore national pride in hockey. In April 1966, Bauer said, \"Our biggest problem is the task of making Canadian out of all of us. We have to start someplace and we have to help our own Canadian athletes\".\nBauer recruited Jackie McLeod to become the next coach of the national team since they had a similar style of being good listeners to players. At the 1966 Ice Hockey World Championships, Bauer expressed his frustrations about officiating at international events after a loss to Czechoslovakia by a 2–1 score, which saw two Canadian goals disallowed. The players wanted to withdraw from the World Championships prior to the final game versus the Soviet Union. Bauer talked the players into continuing after staying up all night, but Canada lost the final game and earned the bronze medal.\nThe Canadian Hockey Foundation was established in 1966 to oversee the national team. Since the foundation was not directly connected to the CAHA, it allowed the national team more flexibility in choosing players since it could bypass the professional-amateur agreement between the CAHA and the NHL. Bauer stated that the foundation had its limits, since it was not granted tax-exempt status to accept donations.\nThe CAHA hosted a Canadian Centennial tournament in 1967 and invited the national teams from the United States, Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. The event was also an attempt to show that Winnipeg would be a suitable host location for the World Championships. The national team Bauer assembled for the event won all three games played and defeated the Soviet Union by a 5–4 score in the final game. At the 1967 Ice Hockey World Championships, Bauer's team won four of seven games played, but lost to the Soviet Union by a 2–1 score and finished with the bronze medal.\nThe CAHA established a second national team to increase the available pool of players at the next Olympics in 1968. Bauer recruited Jack Bownass to coach the second team which was based in Ottawa. Bauer considered both teams equal and disliked attempts by the media to label them as an \"A-team\" in Winnipeg and a \"B-team\" in Ottawa. In ice hockey at the 1968 Winter Olympics, Canada won five of seven games played and earned the bronze medal. Canada went into the final game versus the Soviet Union with a chance to win gold, but lost by a 5–0 score and Bauer described it as the best game he had seen the Soviets play.\nHockey Canada was incorporated in 1968, and the took over management of the national team from the Canadian Hockey Foundation in 1969. Bauer was appointed a member of the board of directors, which decided at its first meeting to make the eligibility of professionals at the World Championships its priority for improving the national team. Hockey Canada successfully secured funding from the Government of Canada for the national team to travel to the 1969 Ice Hockey World Championships in Sweden. Bauer's team was inexperienced internationally, and lost twice each to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden, and place fourth overall.\nNational team goes on hiatus.\nBauer was against the use of professionals at the World Championships. His participation in the national team ended in 1969, when Canada was granted permission by the IIHF to use a limited number of professionals while hosting the 1970 Ice Hockey World Championships. On January 4, 1970, Canada withdrew from international play and hosting the World Championships due to disagreements with the IIHF and the International Olympic Committee over the use of professionals and eligibility of players for the Olympics. The national team was disbanded shortly thereafter.\nBauer remained involved with hockey while serving on the directorate of Canada's National Health &amp; Fitness Council, and continued in an advisory role to hockey coaches and players at UBC. He offered advice to Tom Watt on selecting a Canadian team for the 1972 Winter Universiade, but chose not to coach or manage since Canada had not yet returned to international play.\nBauer wrote an article published in the \"Toronto Sun\" on September 2, 1972, giving reasons why he expected total victory in the 1972 Summit Series featuring Canada's top professional players. He felt that Canada's talent was undeniable, and that the younger Soviet team would use their conditioning and defensive play to limit scoring. He also stated of the Soviets that, \"I think they've realized they've reached a certain plateau and they could improve only by playing our professionals\". He was interviewed on television by Bill Good during game three on the series, and stated that the losses were indicative of domestic hockey issues in Canada, and that we could learn from the Soviets instead of underrating their abilities. Bauer hoped that the series would promote unity in Canada and better international relationships.\nCoaching in Japan and Austria.\nWhile attending the 1968 Winter Olympic Games, Bauer was approached by Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, chairman of the Japan Ice Hockey Federation and owner of the Seibu Tetsudo hockey club to assist with its hockey programs. Bauer first travelled to Japan in October 1968 for a month-long series of hockey clinics across the country. He continued travels to Japan and instructed at hockey schools for two six-week periods each year. His teachings on personal growth and being disciplined on the ice were welcomed within the culture of Japan.\nBauer was never paid for his services, but had his travel and expenses covered by the Seibu Group. Japanese players reciprocated Bauer's efforts by embarking on hockey tours of Canada including stops at UBC. Bauer occasionally coached the Seibu team in league play, but was unable to lead them to a league championship. He declined an offer from Tsutsumi to permanently move to Japan, but continued to work in Japan until 1978. He remained friends with the Japan Ice Hockey Federation and helped to suggest coaches and players from Canada to travel to Japan.\nBauer was invited by the Austrian Ice Hockey Association to coach the Austria men's national ice hockey team in Group B during the 1973 Ice Hockey World Championships hosted in Graz. The team finished in fifth place with two wins and five losses and avoided relegation to Group C.\n1980 Winter Olympic Games.\nThe CAHA agreed to return to international play as of the 1977 Ice Hockey World Championships when professionals were allowed to participate. In October 1977, at a House of Commons and Senate committee studying Canada's role in international hockey, Bauer urged for a plan to be put into place for ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics to avoid setting up the country and players for embarrassment. Hockey Canada named Bauer to be the managing director of the Olympic team that was still restricted to amateurs.\nBauer arranged a training camp six months in length to build teamwork and systems with 150 junior and college players attending. He felt that a lot of work was needed to improve the talent level to win at the Olympics, and struggled to retain talent in competition with professional teams signing amateur players to contracts. Clare Drake, Tom Watt and Lorne Davis were named to coach the national team. Bauer chose to let the coaches do the coaching, but assigned them reading material on subjects he wanted instilled into the players.\nAfter the Olympics, Bauer gave an interview with \"The Globe and Mail\" and made no excuses for the sixth-place finish, but felt that the establishment of a permanent a national team had been completed.\nLater life and death.\nBauer was invited to assist the China men's national ice hockey team in advance of them hosting Group C during the 1981 Ice Hockey World Championships. A relationship for clinics run by UBC instructors had been developed by Bob Hindmarch, but Bauer was unable to travel since he was infected with shingles at the time and recommended another coach instead.\nBauer was appointed vice-president of Hockey Canada in 1981, and chairman of the national team program for the 1984 Winter Olympics. He continued teaching at St. Mark's and assisting with the UBC Thunderbirds hockey team. He wanted to keep the same national team together from the 1980 Winter Olympics and raised $400,000 towards the next Olympics. His involvement with the national team gradually decreased until he was in an advisory role with Hockey Canada by 1984.\nBauer spent his last months resting at the family cottage in Bayfield, Ontario, after he had pancreatic surgery in July 1988. He died at the hospital in Goderich, Ontario from pancreatic cancer on November 9, 1988. He was remembered with services at St. Basil's Church in Toronto, and St. Louis Church in Waterloo, and was interred in the family plot in Mount Hope Cemetery in Waterloo.\nCoaching philosophy.\nBauer was an advocate for players remaining in amateur hockey to receive an education, as opposed to the growing professionalism in the being detrimental to opportunities from learning. He felt that hockey was a means to teach the game of life and way for boys to become men, and modelled the national team after his experiences at St. Michael's. Bauer said that, \"We try to give our players a well-rounded education, not merely ice skills but mental and moral conditioning as well\". He stated that, \"If you can improve the boy as a person he will improve as a hockey player\". As a member of the Basilian Order, Bauer believed that education and the whole person were important and that an individual's relationship with God was only a portion of the whole.\nBauer frowned upon the use of foul language or fisticuffs, and wanted his players to be gentlemanly. He stressed discipline, teamwork and fair play. According to national team manager Rick Noonan, Bauer was gentle in his ways and \"would consult and involve everybody\" on the team.\nImpact on players.\nBauer had an impact on players for the Canadian national team. Glenn Anderson stated that, \"Bauer's influence on me knows no bounds. Although he knew the game inside and out, he was more concerned with the human spirit. He had such an inner strength. And it rubbed off on me. I was blessed to have met him, while he walked among us. Bauer taught us more than a game, but how to have faith in ourselves to be the best\". Brian Conacher said, \"I know that had I not played for Father Bauer, I would never have made it to the NHL. He taught me the discipline and the skills that were lacking. Father Bauer was very involved in the mental, physical and spiritual well-being of all his players. He truly was like a father to this whole group of guys. He was a very inspirational kind of coach. He left an indelible mark on every young man that he came in contact with\".\nHonours and awards.\nBauer was among the inaugural appointees of the Order of Canada when it was established in 1967. He was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada on July 6, 1967, for his contribution to ice hockey and the Canadian national team. The formal investiture was made by the Governor General of Canada on November 24, 1967. Bauer was inducted into both the Waterloo County Hall of Fame, and the Waterloo County Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. He was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a builder for ice hockey in 1973.\nBauer was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the builder category in 1989, the Olympic Hall of Fame in 1992, the UBC Sports Hall of Fame in the builder category in 1996, the IIHF Hall of Fame in the builder category in 1997, the BC Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009, and the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.\nLegacy.\nThe Canadian Press described Bauer as, \"The kindly Roman Catholic priest who brought a reluctant Canadian hockey fraternity into the modern age of international play with his concept of a national team\". Canada's national team was called \"the most nobly conceived of all Canadian hockey enterprises\" in the book \"Hockey Is Our Game\" by Jim Coleman. Bauer was \"an inspirational coach, a caring educator, a master motivator\" and \"devoted to the concept that education and hockey could mix\", according to Kevin Shea of The Hockey Hall of Fame. Brian Conacher stated that, \"Father Bauer, in many respects, was a visionary, a pioneer in recognizing how good European hockey had become. It became evident that the Canadian style — rough and tumble, we'll beat them in the alley if we can’t beat them on the rink type of attitude — was passé\".\nRick Noonan stated, \"The fact that father was a Basilian priest, he used to worry about that a lot, that people would misinterpret that he was trying to turn everyone into a Catholic. But really, he was very ecumenical. Should a player take the Lord's name in vain in the heat of the moment during a game, he would find a gentle hand on his shoulder: \"Now, now, I do the praying around here\". Tom Watt who was an assistant coach for the national team stated, \"Father Bauer is a great Canadian, but I could never get it straight — sometimes when you thought you were talking about hockey, the priest came out of him and sometimes when you thought you were talking to a priest the hockey came out of him\".\nBauer is the namesake of two hockey arenas, including the Father Bauer Arena which opened in 1963 at the University of British Columbia, and the Father David Bauer Olympic Arena in Calgary which was named for him in 1986 and served as a training facility for the Canadian national team. He is also the namesake of a street named Father Bauer Drive in Waterloo.\nScholarships awarded by St. Michael's College School and the University of British Columbia are named for Bauer. Funds from the sale of the Bauer's family cottage were donated to endow the Quest Program to assist in communicating faith by electronic means at the Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, Saskatchewan.\nThe foundation of the national team was featured in a Heritage Minutes clip, and Bauer was subject of the biographical book \"Father Bauer and The Great Experiment\" by Greg Oliver."

        "title": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005",
        "text": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club start 2005 as defending county champions and 11–4 favourites to retain their title. They play their totesport League cricket in Division Two. Warwickshire won the title in 2004 through their batting, and they have further enhanced it with the addition of Alex Loudon.\nIn the traditional Champion County v MCC match that kicks off the season, Warwickshire fared well, but ultimately lost to what essentially was an England A squad. However, when the Championship started, they immediately imposed their authority by thrashing Division One newcomers Glamorgan by an innings. Their first Sunday League game, against Somerset was abandoned as a draw because of rain.\nIn the second Championship game, Warwickshire were outplayed by Kent, who should have won. But determination saw Warwickshire through to the draw. The Bears were 9 wickets down when time was called. Then Ian Bell and Ashley Giles helped trounce Middlesex in the Championship. The following day they beat the Spitfires by 19 runs. On 3 and 4 May they beat Holland in the first round of the C&amp;G Trophy.\nThey then lost to Sussex in first the totesport League and then the Championship. On 17 May they beat Leicestershire at home to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy. Three days later they beat Derbyshire easily in the one-day league. They then beat Cambridge UCCE by 18 runs in an MCC University match, before trouncing title rivals Hampshire by ten wickets at home inside two days.\nThe first game of June saw a comfortable 4-day draw away to Surrey, before a 49-run win against the same opposition kept them in the promotion fight in the National League Division Two. Their fine first-class form continued, as they won their third County Championship match in style at Gloucestershire, but they were thumped by Kent in the next game, hampered by a groin injury to Heath Streak. That injury could have been a cause of their seven-wicket defeat at home to Leicestershire.\nWarwickshire's long batting line-up came to surprisingly little use in the Twenty20 Cup, as they lost their first two matches, and their first win came against hapless Glamorgan. After six games, they had only scraped five points, and endured two one-run losses to Worcestershire. They managed to get through to the quarter-finals, however, thanks to big wins over Somerset and Northamptonshire. They followed that up with two wins in the National League, over Derbyshire and Durham, and also made it to the C&amp;G Trophy semi-final with a five-wicket victory of Kent. So, going into the Twenty20 game with Surrey, they were on a five-game win streak, and after the scores were tied under the Duckworth-Lewis method the teams had to face off in a bowl-off. Warwickshire lost 3–4 to bow out of the tournament.\nTheir poor form was continued in the County Championship, where they lost in three days – with only four balls delivered on the third day – against Nottinghamshire. A win over Yorkshire meant that they kept their vital third place in Division 2 in the National League, though, and they advanced to second after defeating Kent. A crucial, and close, three-wicket win against Middlesex in the Championship followed, as Warwickshire jumped up to fifth place in the Championship, half a point ahead of Surrey in the third relegation spot, and they followed that up with a big ten-wicket win over whipping boys Glamorgan. A loss to Nottinghamshire, however, sent them right back into the mire. Some relief came in the C&amp;G Trophy, when Warwickshire thumped Lancashire to progress to the final. Rain cancelled the National League match with Leicestershire, meaning that Warwickshire still trailed the promotion places by two points, and their loss to Sussex the following day did not help. However, they got revenge over Sussex by beating them in the County Championship later on in the week, but the next week saw two losses to Hampshire – first in the Championship and then in the C&amp;G Trophy final.\nThe one-day losses continued, as the Bears fell to Somerset in the National League on the first Sunday in September, but they recovered with a Championship draw and a League win over Surrey. The latter left them with an outside chance of League promotion, trailing Derbyshire in third place by four points but with two games in hand, but they went up into third place with a win in Scotland, and got a four-point lead and a vastly superior net run rate to the fourth-place with a 102-run win over Yorkshire. Their Championship season ended in fourth place after a 181-run win over Gloucestershire, and despite losing their last National League match of the season to Durham Dynamos, Warwickshire were promoted, and will play in Division One of both the Championship and League in 2006.\nMatch details.\nMCC v Warwickshire (8–11 April).\nMCC beat Warwickshire by 7 wickets\nWarwickshire were the Champion County in 2004, and therefore they kicked off the 2005 season with the traditional match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's on 8 April. The MCC side was effectively an \"England A\" team, with the match being the closest thing to a Test trial this season. It rained on and off throughout the first day. Just before 5pm, the captains tossed. Nick Knight of Warwickshire won the toss and elected to bat. However, more rain came down and at around 5pm play was abandoned – the first day of the 2005 cricket season would see no play.\nThe second day saw 87 overs of play before bad light ended the day's play. Warwickshire put on 347 for 5 declared. Nick Knight's 115 was the first century of the season. Wagh contributed 66 and Trott 75. The third day started with a confident and chanceless first wicket partnership of 109 between Alastair Cook and Matt Prior. Then Cook, who grafted out his innings with careful footwork and plenty of off-side shots, and Owais Shah, who got off to a difficult start, put on 166 runs for the second wicket, before Cook fell for 120. The MCC declared soon after at 275 for 2, 70 runs behind. Warwickshire started their second innings confidently, and were 70 for 3 at close on the third day.\nOn the fourth and last day, Warwickshire powered on to 225 for 4 before declaring, with Tony Frost top scoring with 91. This set the MCC a target of 296 to win. On a wicket that held up well, Cook added 97 to his first innings century. By the time he was third out at 235, Andy Flower was well set. He scored an undefeated 110 as the hosts won by 7 wickets with eight overs to spare. The MCC remain undefeated in the traditional game against the previous season's traditional county since the fixture was re-established in 1970. The match leaves Prior and Cook in contention for possible future England call-ups.(Cricinfo scorecard)\nWarwickshire v Glamorgan (13–16 April).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (1pt) by an innings and 43 runs\nGlamorgan won the toss at a cold Edgbaston and chose to bat. The pitch had been roughed up to encourage turn for the benefit of Ashley Giles. The England selectors will have been pleased that he made the most of it, taking 6 for 44, the third-best figures of his career. First, however, Matthew Elliott, Glamorgan's Australian batsman scored 84 to take his team to a comfortable looking 157 for 3. However, Glamorgan then lost their final seven wickets for just 41 runs. Warwickshire's catching was excellent, as they restricted their opposition to 198 off 63.3 overs, two short of their first bonus point. Nick Knight and Mark Wagh then saw Warwickshire through to 68 for no loss, before bad light stopped play.\nAfter losing Knight and Wagh with only 4 added to the overnight score, the Champion county showed their class. After the start of the day, the pitch calmed down, and England hopeful, Ian Bell, who scored 96, and Michael Powell put on 153 for the fourth wicket. Dougie Brown then helped himself to a half-century being unbeaten on 85 at close, with Powell on 144 not out and Warwickshire on 415 for 4, 217 ahead. Alex Wharf and Simon Jones bowled enthusiastically, but without much to show for it.\nThe bat dominated on a cold third day, with runs coming at around 5 an over, though this was aided by there being short boundaries. This allowed 362 runs to be scored, even though almost all the third session was lost to bad light. In the morning, Warwickshire's runs flowed freely. Although Powell only add 2, Brown moved on to 122, and Heath Streak had time to score 41 not out before Warwickshire declared on 564 for 8, 366 ahead. Elliott and David Hemp put on 162 for the second wicket. However, Matthew Maynard went for a duck, leaving Glamorgan on 213 for 4 at close.\nOn the fourth day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a partnership of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, \"Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch they were always going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We had a bit of luck so we are not going to start going around saying that we are going to win the Championship just because we have won one match.\" John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, \"Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game.\" (Cricinfo scorecard)\nWarwickshire v Somerset (17 April).\nMatch abandoned – Warwickshire (2pts), Somerset (2pts)\nWarwickshire won the toss at Edgbaston and put Somerset in to bat. Mike Burns dominated proceedings with his 107 from 134 balls, supported by Keith Parsons' 51 and James Hildreth's 54, as Somerset scored 254 for 5 in their 45 overs. However, then bad weather put an end to the day's play before Warwickshire had a chance to bat. \nKent v Warwickshire (20–23 April).\nKent (10pts) drew with Warwickshire (10pts)\nThe first day at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury saw Warwickshire and England left arm spin bowler Ashley Giles take 5 for 86, and Martin van Jaarsveld 118 as Kent finished on 342 for 9. At the end of a second day, Kent took their score to 347. Nick Knight, who scored 100, and Ian Bell, with 63, got Warwickshire off to a good start. But from 179 for 1, Min Patel and Amjad Khan bowled Kent into the match. Warwickshire finished the day on 288 for 7 off 100 overs.\nOn the third day, Warwickshire were soon finished off for 309, 38 behind Kent. The Dane Khan did the brunt of the damage, finishing with on 6 for 73. Then van Jaarsveld and David Fulton played with great determination and put together their second century stand of the game with 155. At close, Kent were 308 for 6, 346 ahead, and they declared overnight.\nOn a fourth-day pitch favouring the spinners, Warwickshire found themselves in deep trouble on 73 for 5. If Kent were to finish champions, they really should have won from that position, but Tony Frost and Alex Loudon had different ideas when they batted throughout the whole afternoon session. After tea, Patel took three quick wickets, and Kent again looked on course for the win. But Frost, who scored 82, survived throughout the entire evening session, and after the ninth wicket fell, last man Neil Warren survived for 15 balls to earn Warwickshire the draw. They were 233 for 9 at stumps. (BBC scorecard)\nWarwickshire v Middlesex (27–30 April).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Middlesex (5pts) by seven wickets\nMiddlesex batted first at Edgbaston. Their Irish left-hander, Ed Joyce, was the anchor of the innings making 92 as he took his side from 56 for 4 to 253 for 7. He was assisted by a quick-fire half-century from Scott Styris, an innings somewhat out of pace with his team-mates' innings. They were finally all out for 298. Warwickshire lost 2 wickets in scoring 18 by the close.\nOnly 68 overs were possible on the second day. Ian Bell dominated, setting out his case for an England call-up, with 143 not out. He said, \"If I was to play for England, I'd bat anywhere I was told to bat. Just to play would be great. I'm batting at three for Warwickshire and enjoying it. I know there’s some competition [for Test places] and there's a lot being talked about it. I've just got to concentrate on scoring as many runs as I can for Warwickshire.\" No other player scored so freely though, and Warwickshire ended the day on 277 for 6.\nOn the third day, England spin bowler Ashley Giles, who notched up 62, stayed with him. Bell was finally run out for a seven-hour 231 as Warwickshire closed on 430. Giles then starred with the ball, taking two wickets as Middlesex finished on 137 for 3 at stumps. On the fourth day, Giles tripled his tally to end with 6, as Middlesex faltered to 246 despite 63 from Joyce. That left Warwickshire needing only 115 to win, and despite Paul Hutchison taking two wickets, Bell led his team to a seven-wicket victory by scoring 47. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nWarwickshire v Kent (1 May).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 19 runs\nNick Knight scored 122 off 125, the highest score of the National League season thus far, to boot the Bears up to 279 for 7 off their 45 overs. A spirited fightback from the Spitfires saw them hang in until the 44th over, but eventually, despite 82 from Martin van Jaarsveld and a 40-run last wicket stand between Simon Cook and Martin Saggers, they perished for 260 all out with 11 balls to go. (BBC scorecard)\nHolland v Warwickshire (3–4 May).\nWarwickshire beat Holland by 23 runs to progress to the Second Round of the C&amp;G Trophy\nNick Knight made 108 in Rotterdam to take Warwickshire to 237 for 5, despite five maidens being bowled by the Dutch. In reply Holland were 101 for 4 off 27 runs when rain prevented play for the first day, leaving them 137 to win off 23 overs on the second day. Daan van Bunge was doing well with 37 off 37 balls at close. Van Bunge was the mainstay of the reply on the second day, and the Dutch looked good as long as he and Billy Stelling were at the crease, and they led the way to 205 for 5 before Stelling was caught off Neil Carter. That precipitated a collapse, as the last 4 wickets went for 9 runs, and Warwickshire saved a 23-run victory. (BBC scorecard)\nSussex v Warwickshire (8 May).\nSussex (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by 44 runs (D/L method)\nSussex Sharks had England wicket-keeper Matt Prior and former Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin to thank for their imposing win over the Bears. Prior scored 144 – a career best score – and Goodwin 79 to lift Sussex to a massive 283 for 7, Zimbabwe all-rounder Heath Streak the only bowler with reasonably respectable figures of three for 39 off 9 overs. The reply was shortened by rain, setting Warwickshire 198 to win off 30 overs, but after 48 from Neil Carter there was little left in the Warwickshire reply as they finished on 153 for 7.\nSussex v Warwickshire (10–12 May).\nSussex (21pts) beat Warwickshire (2pts) by an innings and 87 runs\nMichael Yardy (88) and Murray Goodwin (108) as Sussex made 282 for 6 on the first day at Hove. Batting was not easy, with Heath Streak, Dewald Pretorius and Neil Carter all swinging the ball. On the second day, Sussex moved to 412 all out, and in reply, defending champions Warwickshire made 141 for 5. There was worse news for England cricket fans as Ashley Giles was unable to field because of a strained hip flexor muscle. Giles said, \"It's a shame because it's been going really well. It's the best start to a season I've had but the hip was a bit stiff last week and it got worse yesterday. I haven't had this kind of injury before so, even without the England situation, it would be stupid to make it any worse.\"\nOn the third day, Sussex completed the match. Warwickshire were all out for 179, and then, following-on they were dismissed again for 146. Fifteen wickets fell in 64 overs as the Sussex bowlers made the most of an erratically bouncing pitch. It was Warwickshire's first Championship loss since the last day of the 2003 season. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nWarwickshire v Leicestershire (17 May).\nWarwickshire beat Leicestershire by 83 runs to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nDougie Brown took a wicket in each of his first three overs to help a poor Warwickshire one-day side to victory at Edgbaston. Warwickshire batted first, and the hosts were on 78 for two after 15 overs, with Nick Knight (69) and Ian Bell (35) in control. Then Bell was stumped attacking a ball from Claude Henderson leaving the score on 116 for 3 in the 22nd over. There then was a collapse as 5 fell for 64, before Heath Streak and Tony Frost put on 55 in the last 9 overs to lift Warwickshire to 235.\nIn Leicestershire's innings immediately faltered as Brown's wickets reduced them to 16 for 3. Brown was helped by good tight bowling from Heath Streak at the other end, which meant they chose to attack Brown. Leicestershire tried to rebuild, but never managed it, finally being dismissed for 152 with 6.3 overs to go. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nDerbyshire v Warwickshire (20 May).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by 52 runs\nDerbyshire Phantoms suffered another drubbing at Derby after Warwickshire Bears raced past 200 thanks to half-centuries from Nick Knight and Jim Troughton. Although 6 wickets fell in the last 10 overs, they still made 260, with Troughton top-scoring with 73. In reply, Derbyshire lost wickets regularly, and although Jonathan Moss scored 65, no-one was able to stay with him as the hosts were all out for 208. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCambridge UCCE v Warwickshire (21–23 May).\nWarwickshire beat Cambridge UCCE by 18 runs\nWarwickshire survived a scare as a virtual second XI still beat the Cambridge students by 18 runs. The first day at Fenner's was ruined by rain, with only 6 overs possible. Warwickshire batted first, losing three wickets for no runs to collapse to 48 for 4, but Jonathan Trott's three-hour 150 not out lifted the visitors to 296 for 6 declared. In reply, Zohail Sharif made an unbeaten fifty as the students made their way to 109 for 1 in just 24 overs. An overnight declaration from the students was followed by an equalling blazing accumulation of runs from Warwickshire led them to 127 for 1. In the reply, Cambridge came too close for comfort, though, and at 281 for 6 with 34 runs left to hit it looked like they could do it – but opening batsman and off spinner Alex Loudon came to the rescue with three wickets for 48, as Cambridge collapsed to 296 all out and lost the match by 18 runs.\nWarwickshire v Hampshire (25–26 May).\nWarwickshire (19pts) beat Hampshire (3pts) by ten wickets\nDefending champions Warwickshire needed a win against table-toppers Hampshire to stay in the title chase, and in a low-scoring match at Stratford-on-Avon they managed it. The Scot Dougie Brown was the pick of the bowlers, taking four for 59 as the visitors crumbled to 184, rescued somewhat by a run-a-ball 34 from off-spinner Shaun Udal who batted at nine. Nick Knight and 22-year-old Ian Westwood, batting in his fourth first-class game, sent Warwickshire to 135 for 0 before losing a couple of wickets before stumps. The second day belonged to Hampshire, however, taking seven wickets – captain Shane Warne with six of them for 88 runs, as they crumbled to 265.\nHowever, a magnificent spell from Zimbabwean all-rounder Heath Streak, who took four wickets for 11 from nine overs, including five maidens, reduced Hampshire to 34 for 5 before Michael Brown and Sean Ervine rebuilt. However, two quick wickets before tea meant that Hampshire led by six runs with three wickets remaining – a surefire loss, almost. They rebuilt somewhat, but another two wickets from Streak resulted in him finishing with 6 for 31, and Hampshire were bowled out for 124. Nick Knight then smashed 39 not out off 27 balls to see Warwickshire past the 44-run target inside 4.4 overs and a win inside two days.\nWarwickshire v Scotland (29 May).\nScotland (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one wicket\nA poor pitch at Stratford-on-Avon, and some lacklustre batting saw the Warwickshire Bears record their second loss in the National League, as they crumbled to 113 all out on their home ground. Australian-born Paul Hoffmann took three for 19 for Scotland Saltires, but all the Scottish bowlers chipped in with wickets, and it was in fact a good recovery from Warwickshire as they were 17 for 5 and 48 for 7. In reply, Dougie Lockhart and South African Jonathan Beukes recorded good partnership to lift Scotland to 70 for 1, but a burst of wickets from Heath Streak turned the match again, as Scotland lost four wickets for 20 runs. However, Hoffmann saw Scotland across the line, smashing a six off Neil Carter to win the match by one wicket. Extras were the second-highest scorer, with 28, as Warwickshire conceded 20 wides.\nSurrey v Warwickshire (1–4 June).\nSurrey (10pts) drew with Warwickshire (8pts)\nSurrey had the better of the first three days at Whitgift School, which is located in Croydon and is now in its fifth year as a festival venue. Richard Clinton and Jonathan Batty both made 84 to bring up a first innings total of 340 for the hosts, and Mohammad Akram then took 5 for 51 as the defending champions were all out for 209 on the second day, and Scott Newman survived five overs with Clinton, adding 14 runs. Surrey declared on 310 for 7, which gave them just over a day to bowl out Warwickshire. Despite fine bowling from Harbhajan Singh, who was making his Surrey debut, the Warwickshire batsmen held up well with Michael Powell and Alex Loudon putting on an unbeaten partnership of 131 to see them safe on 222 for 3 at close. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSurrey v Warwickshire (5 June).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by 49 runs\nAt Whitgift School, Warwickshire Bears recorded a massive 309 for 8 in 45 overs to bat Surrey Lions out of the game. Neil Carter opened the innings with a typical 58 off only 36 balls, smashing four sixes and five fours in the process, while James Troughton scored 69. Only medium-pacer Neil Saker, playing in his seventh List-A game, avoided the routing as he was hit for 17 off five overs, taking the wicket of Jonathan Trott for 9. In reply, Mark Ramprakash and Ali Brown looked to take Surrey to the target, but when Brown departed for 52 off 34 balls, the air went out of Surrey's balloon. Ramprakash scored 89 not out, and became Surrey's top scorer, but Surrey finished all out for 260 with 22 balls remaining in their innings as Carter took three for 37 while Heath Streak and Dougie Brown snared two wickets each.\nGloucestershire v Warwickshire (10–13 June).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by an innings and 2 runs\nA massive batting effort from Warwickshire compounded with a remarkable second-innings bowling spell from Heath Streak and a spineless Gloucestershire effort in general, saw Warwickshire move to the top of the Division One table. It started all right enough for the hosts at Bristol, as a marathon three-hour fifty from James Pearson and 23 extras sent them to 254 on the first day. However, a partnership of 151 between Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott lifted Warwickshire into the ascendancy, as no Gloucestershire bowler found the required bite, and everyone of the top ten except Michael Powell went into double figures as Warwickshire amassed 473 in nearly 150 overs. Then, Streak stole the show. As Streak grabbed four wickets in the first hour, Gloucestershire were quickly 20 for 5, and despite a rescuing effort from Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher, Gloucestershire were all out for 217 – two runs short of making Warwickshire bat again.\nWarwickshire v Kent (15–18 June).\nKent (22pts) beat Warwickshire (3pts) by an innings and 164 runs\nWarwickshire felt the loss of seamer Heath Streak to injury as they went down by a massive margin to a strong Kent side at Maidstone. Batting first, Warwickshire were 116 for 8 when Tony Frost departed for 23, Simon Cook and Amjad Khan having taken three wickets each. However, a ninth-wicket partnership of 97 between Streak and Neil Carter, along with a level-headed stand from the number 11 Neil Warren lifted Warwickshire to 252. As it turned out, it was nowhere near enough. Streak limpered off in his fifth over with a groin injury, leaving all-rounder Alex Loudon and Carter to do the brunt of the bowling, and they were woefully ineffective against Kent's batting line-up. Matthew Walker and Darren Stevens both made centuries for Kent, Martin van Jaarsveld chipped in with 62, while Loudon was Warwickshire's best bowler with three for 130, Kent amassed 569 – a lead of 317 runs. In the twenty overs remaining on the third day, Andrew Hall dug out two wickets for Kent, including England Test batsman Ian Bell for a duck. On a fourth-day pitch which turned plenty, Min Patel could take six for 53, as Warwickshire crumbled in a woeful heap for 153.\nWarwickshire v Leicestershire (19 June).\nLeicestershire (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by seven wickets\nThe most striking feature of this match would be Ashley Giles returning to bowl for Warwickshire Bears after a hip injury, replacing Heath Streak, who had been injured in the groin in the previous match. However, it couldn't help them against Leicestershire Foxes. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and promptly crumbled to 43 for 4, after good new-ball bowling from Ottis Gibson and Charl Willoughby. Jonathan Trott hit 93, however, as the Bears recovered to 217 for 6. Their innings included three run outs. Leicestershire were always on target and won with eight balls to spare, Darren Maddy recording a 114-ball century and ending with 107 not out as Leicestershire reached 218 for 3.\nWorcestershire v Warwickshire (22 June).\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\nIn the local battle at New Road, Worcestershire Royals eked out a victory over rivals Warwickshire Bears. Graeme Hick and Ben Smith both made big scores, with 67 and 47, and skipper Gareth Batty also made 21 to send Worcestershire to 177 for 7. Warwickshire then collapsed to accurate bowling, losing their entire top order except Jonathan Trott to end up on 68 for 5 – but Michael Powell made 40 not out batting at seven, turning the innings almost back to Warwickshire's favour. In the end, however, they were two runs short, their No. 11 Nick Warren only managing to hit one off the two balls he faced.\nNorthamptonshire v Warwickshire (24 June).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by 38 runs\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks took their second victory from two Twenty20 Cup matches thus far, as they accumulated 143 for 5 in 14 overs, despite no batsman hitting more than 40 in a rain-shortened match at Northampton. Scotsman Dougie Brown took one for nine off three overs for Warwickshire Bears, but the target was too large for the visitors, as Northamptonshire bowler Ben Phillips removed four Warwickshire lower-order batsmen – his second four-wicket-haul in three days – as the Bears crumbled to 105 for 9.\nGlamorgan v Warwickshire (25 June).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 54 runs\nWarwickshire Bears won their first Twenty20 match of the season in style, the deep batting line-up finally paying off. Almost every batsman contributed in their massive 205 for 7, Jamie Troughton top-scoring with 42, and no Glamorgan Dragons bowler escaped their wrath. When the Dragons batted, only Matthew Elliott and Sourav Ganguly gave them any hope of winning, and Ganguly's 36 off 35 balls was verging on the point of being useless when the required rate was 10 an over. A disciplined Warwickshire fielding effort – the Bears only conceded one extra – and Alex Loudon taking five for 33, resulted in Glamorgan falling to 151 all out in 18.2 overs.\nGloucestershire v Warwickshire (28 June).\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Warwickshire (1pt)\n37 balls were delivered before Gloucestershire Steelbacks and Warwickshire Bears were forced to abandon the game at The County Ground, Bristol due to rain. Warwickshire were 44 for 1 after 10 leg-byes and 16 not out from Nick Knight when the game was stopped. \nWarwickshire v Glamorgan (30 June).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by four runs\nGlamorgan Dragons continued their poor form in an eventful game at Edgbaston. Jamie Troughton's 51 rescued Warwickshire Bears from a potentially tricky situation at 56 for 4, and quick hitting from Dougie Brown along with eleven extras gave the hosts a total of 169 for 9. Glamorgan started well, with Sourav Ganguly and Matthew Elliott lifting them to 88 for 1 before leaving in quick succession to Neil Carter and Jonathan Trott respectively. Michael Powell and David Hemp then built another big partnership of 59 to see Glamorgan 147 for 3, but Carter and Brown then shared five wickets as Glamorgan's lower middle order fell apart. Powell tried to pair up with Dean Cosker, but the damage was already done, and Powell was run out on the penultimate ball as they needed six runs from two balls.\nWarwickshire v Worcestershire (1 July).\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by one run\nWorcestershire Royals took their second successive one-run victory over Warwickshire Bears, to the agony of home fans at Edgbaston. After Heath Streak took two early wickets, Neil Carter entered the scene as the sixth bowler to be used. He took five wickets inside four overs, for 19 runs, as Worcestershire were all out for 141 with seven balls to spare. In reply, two run outs and wickets from Gareth Batty and Zander de Bruyn left Warwickshire trailing by 60 with one wicket in hand, with Heath Streak and James Anyon at the crease. Streak rotated the strike well, facing most of the balls and hitting most of the runs, and brought the score to 140 for 9 with a ball to spare. Then – setting off for the last run that would tie the scores (and win the match for Warwickshire on fewer wickets lost) – Streak was run out for 59, off 32 balls, and Warwickshire's quarter-final hopes were dented, but not wiped out.\nWarwickshire v Somerset (4 July).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 47 runs\nWarwickshire Bears jumped on the quarter-final train just as it seemed to be leaving the station, grabbing the ticket out of the hands of Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped them up with a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.\nWarwickshire v Northamptonshire (6 July).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 41 runs\nWarwickshire Bears were lifted to a total of 205 for 2 by hitting eight sixes at Edgbaston, Ian Bell carrying his side with 66 not out off just 38 balls. Nick Knight also made 61 as Northamptonshire Steelbacks failed to make any impact with the ball. The Northamptonshire reply was stifled by some reasonably economical bowling, with no regular bowler conceding more than eight an over, and good fielding which yielded one run out and stopped the boundaries. Warwickshire seamer Jamie Anyon took three for 34, for his second successive match with a three-wicket haul, while Usman Afzaal became top scorer with a run-a-ball 43. Ben Phillips hit 41 not out from number four to complement his bowling figures of two for 43. In the end, Northamptonshire made 164 for 6, but still went through – along with Warwickshire, who finished second in their group thanks to their win over Somerset two days earlier.\nWarwickshire v Derbyshire (9 July).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by five wickets\nWarwickshire Bears squeezed to a five-wicket win at Edgbaston thanks to good bowling and a quickfire innings from wicket-keeper Trevor Penney. Derbyshire Phantoms batted first, losing wickets regularly, with only Steve Stubbings making over 25 with his 108-ball 69. Neil Carter excelled with the ball, taking three for 28, although four of six Warwickshire bowlers took part in Derbyshire's collapse to 201 for 9. Warwickshire's reply was haunted by wickets taken by Jonathan Moss – who ended with three for 32 – however, Jonathan Trott and Trevor Penney added 38 for the last wicket, and Warwickshire passed the target with five balls to spare.\nWarwickshire v Kent (15 July).\nWarwickshire beat Kent by five wickets to progress to the Semi-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nAndrew Hall and Robert Key gave Kent some hope of winning the match at Edgbaston with their opening partnership of 120 runs, but spinners Ashley Giles and Alex Loudon broke through twice each to limit the final score to 259 for 6. Warwickshire's reply centred on former England ODI player Nic Knight, who made fourteen fours in his 27th one-day century. Three wickets from Justin Kemp had earlier set Warwickshire back to 118 for 3, but Knight and Trevor Penney who made 50 not out off 43 balls, guided Warwickshire to the target with nearly four overs to spare.\nDurham v Warwickshire (17 July).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Durham (0pts) by five wickets\nDurham Dynamos were to regret their decision of batting first against Warwickshire Bears. On a poor pitch, Warwickshire bowlers Heath Streak, Dougie Brown and Neil Carter took full advantage – the latter two bowling a total of nine maiden overs, while Streak took three for 13 before breaking down with an injury. Durham were 49 for 8 before Liam Plunkett and Neil Killeen chipped in with low but sensible scores, while Dale Benkenstein made 90 at the other end – over sixty per cent of Durham's total of 147. Despite Ashley Noffke taking two early wickets, Alex Loudon anchored the chase with 51 off 61 deliveries, and Warwickshire batted to 148 for 5 with over ten overs remaining.\nSurrey v Warwickshire (18 July).\nMatch tied (D/L Method); Surrey won 4–3 in a bowl-out and progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\nIn an incredible finish to the knock-out quarter-final between Surrey Lions and Warwickshire Bears, the match was tied, so the players had to resort to a bowl-off – cricket's version of a penalty shootout, in which five players have two attempts at bowling at unguarded stumps, and if the stumps fall down, that was one point for their team. Surrey opened the batting in this match at The Oval, having been put in to bat by the Bears' captain Nick Knight. It was a shaky effort, often interrupted by wickets, and part-timer Jonathan Trott snared two wickets for 19 – admittedly tail-enders Ian Salisbury and Tim Murtagh. Mark Ramprakash, however, hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 34 to guide Surrey to 149 for 8, well below a par score. Warwickshire's innings then began under heavy cloud cover that assisted the Surrey swing bowlers. After Neil Carter went first ball, Warwickshire struggled in the rain, and the bad weather eventually stopped play just before five overs was played – so that, if the players couldn't return, the match would be declared a no-result. However, the rain gave way reasonably quickly, and quick hitting from Trevor Penney in particular – who made 20 off 12 balls before being caught off a ball from Rikki Clarke closed down the deficit.\nWith five overs being cut off the Warwickshire chase, they needed 118 from 15 overs, and they had got to 115 for 8 with one ball remaining and Dewald Pretorius and an injured Heath Streak, who had not bowled, at the crease. The umpires consulted, and were uncertain about what would happen if Warwickshire scored two – which, in the event, happened. As the par scores under Duckworth-Lewis were level, the captains agreed to have a bowl-off (alternatively the umpires could have forced a bowl-off or decided the game on a toss of the coin). After five players had tried to get the stumps down, both teams had managed the feat twice, and now a sudden death style bowl-off followed. The next player from each side managed to get the stumps down once each, so the score was now 3–3, but Warwickshire's Heath Streak missed both his attempts and Tim Murtagh got the stumps down and won the match for the hosts by 4–3.\nWarwickshire v Nottinghamshire (20–22 July).\nNottinghamshire (20pts) beat Warwickshire (4pts) by ten wickets\nAn eventful match at Edgbaston looked to give Nottinghamshire the lead in the County Championship, as they swept aside Warwickshire with few problems. The Warwickshire batting line-up sorely missed Ian Bell, who was on Test match duty for England, and after an opening partnership of 101 between Nic Knight and Ian Westwood, an implosion followed. Warwickshire faltered to 168 for 8, and only 21-year-old Luke Parker, playing his seventh first-class match, saved them from a sub-200 score as he made an unbeaten 34.\nWarwickshire's bowling, which lacked an injured Heath Streak, also suffered, and despite excellent figures of six for 92 from Alex Loudon the Nottinghamshire batsmen ran away with it as Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian and Australian David Hussey all made fifties. Then, it was a Nottinghamshire spinner's turn to take centre stage – Graeme Swann. In 23 overs, he took six for 57, including the entire Warwickshire middle order from three to six – only Westwood passed 25, and Warwickshire could only muster 133. As if to make the humiliation complete, Swann was promoted to number 1, and hit one boundary and four additional runs before stumps were drawn after one over. Nottinghamshire were eight for no loss overnight, chasing 12 to win, and Darren Bicknell hit the winning runs off Dewald Pretorius four balls into the fourth day.\nYorkshire v Warwickshire (24 July).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by seven wickets\nYorkshire Phoenix were tied down by Warwickshire Bears bowlers Dougie Brown and Alex Loudon, as the Phoenix only managed to post 201 for 7 at Scarborough. Brown took one for 32 and Loudon one for 23 off nine overs each, Michael Lumb being restricted to 57 off 86 balls as top scorer for Yorkshire. Two early wickets from Neil Carter also helped the Warwickshire fielding effort. In reply, Carter smacked six sixes and five fours, taking 38 balls to make 65, and Jonathan Trott and Jamie Troughton took Warwickshire to the target with seven wickets and just over seven overs to spare, as Yorkshire's losing streak in the National League was extended to three matches.\nKent v Warwickshire (27 July).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Kent (0pts) by three wickets\nIn a day/night match at St Lawrence Ground, Warwickshire captain Nick Knight sent Kent in to bat, and his South African pace bowler Dewald Pretorius took a flurry of wickets in good bowling conditions. Ending with five for 32, he took the first five wickets of the innings as Kent collapsed to 29 for 5, but South Africans Justin Kemp and Martin van Jaarsveld rebuilt quickly. Despite little support – no batsman apart from himself passed 25 – Kemp made his way to 84 off 93 balls, as Kent scrambled 177 for 9. In reply, Warwickshire got to 19 for 0, but a fiery spell from Martin Saggers yielded three wickets, as Nick Knight, Ian Bell and Jamie Troughton were all dismissed in single figures. Warwickshire's fifth-wicket partners saw off the opening bowling, however, and went after the part-timers instead, in chase of what suddenly looked like a big target of 178.\nAlex Loudon rebuilt well, however, with just 20 of his 73 runs coming in boundaries, while his first partner Jonathan Trott failed to hit any runs and probably did the team a favour when he edged a ball from Robert Joseph – cousin of West Indies batsman Sylvester Joseph – behind, gone for 10 off 40 balls. The wicket looked like it was the first of a collapse, however, as Trevor Frost departed shortly afterwards with Warwickshire on 62 for 6. However, Trevor Penney made 42 – including just the one four – in a 77-run partnership with Loudon, and Dougie Brown made an unbeaten 16 at the end to lead Warwickshire home with five balls to spare.\nMiddlesex v Warwickshire (3–6 August).\nWarwickshire (19pts) beat Middlesex (5.5pts) by three wickets\nWarwickshire had got adequate replacement for their injured Zimbabwean Heath Streak, as Makhaya Ntini took four for 79 on his debut for the Bears against Middlesex. However, Paul Weekes made 92 not out to rescue them from a poor position at 139 for 6 to a final total of 323. Then, another overseas player making his overseas debut – Stuart Clark from New South Wales, Australia – took five wickets, three on the first day and two on the second, as Warwickshire plummeted to 85 for 6. It took another 92 – from Scot Dougie Brown to see them past 200, and his four-hour knock proved invaluable to Warwickshire's eventual turn-around.\nBen Hutton and Owais Shah looked to set a massive target on day three, however, pairing up for 151 to add to Middlesex' 51-run first innings lead – but again Ntini came to the rescue for Warwickshire, as only Shah got the ball off the square and Middlesex whimpered from 281 for 3 to 330 all out. Shah finished not out, having hit 15 fours and two sixes in a five-hour 156. Peter Trego then took two wickets with two balls as Warwickshire fell to six for two, but Jamie Troughton smacked four sixes and twelve fours in a quickfire 119 as Warwickshire forced their way to 221 for 3 at stumps, with Nick Knight not out overnight on 67, leaving the match poised with 161 to win and seven wickets in hand. Knight was dismissed for 75 by the Australian Clark, who also removed Neil Carter for 15, but Alex Loudon proved too difficult to get out. His unbeaten 95, along with 27 not out from Luke Parker, saw Warwickshire pass the target with three wickets to spare, despite Middlesex' slow over rate, which caused them to be deducted half a point.\nGlamorgan v Warwickshire (10–12 August).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (3pts) by ten wickets\nWarwickshire took control of proceedings on the first day at Colwyn Bay, as they fielded a bowling attack with no English-born players against Glamorgan. South African international Makhaya Ntini was the least effective, only getting the wicket of number 11 Dean Cosker, and conceding 49 runs in the process. Meanwhile, Scot Dougie Brown took four for 58, but Glamorgan actually recovered quite well from 76 for 6 to their final score of 239. However, their blunt bowling attack were shown up again, as Ian Westwood recorded his maiden first-class century, four batsmen passed fifty, and Warwickshire muscled their way to 545 for 7 before declaring. Jonathan Trott also made 152 for Warwickshire, while Robert Croft was the most effective bowler – with three for 126.\nWicket-keeper Mark Wallace then smashed 68 not out off 50 balls to see Glamorgan to the end of the day at 99 for 1. However, he only faced two balls on the third morning before being lbw to Brown. Most of the Warwickshire bowlers got in among the wickets – part-time medium pace bowler Trott taking two for 19 in four overs, for example – and Warwickshire were set three to win, which they achieved off fourteen deliveries as Nick Knight hit a single off David Harrison.\nNottinghamshire v Warwickshire (14–16 August).\nNottinghamshire (22pts) beat Warwickshire (2.5pts) by an innings and 151 runs\nRyan Sidebottom dug out the top four, ending with four for 41, and Andrew Harris got exactly the same figures (but from half the overs), as Warwickshire crashed to 156 at Trent Bridge after winning the toss and opting to bat first. And from then on, it only got worse for the visitors from the Midlands. Only Dougie Brown's 34 not out took them past 150, and he then took two wickets as Nottinghamshire looked to go the same way – being 45 for 3. However, David Hussey and Chris Read batted well together, seeing Nottinghamshire to stumps and making fifties. Their 148-run partnership gave Nottinghamshire a healthy lead, but Hussey did not stop there. He made a career-best 232 not out – eventually running out of partners as Nottinghamshire finished on 514, to secure a first-innings lead of 358. Brown took five for 128, but despite bowling the most overs of all he could not stop the rampant Hussey. Nick Knight was injured and could not bat, so with ten men Warwickshire had to score 358 to make Nottinghamshire bat again. It was an impossible task – Alex Loudon and Neil Carter both made scores in the forties, but the team succumbed to 207 and their third innings defeat of the season. Warwickshire were later deducted 0.5 points for a slow over rate on day two.\nWarwickshire v Lancashire (20 August).\nWarwickshire beat Lancashire by 99 runs to progress to the C&amp;G Trophy Final\nWarwickshire put in a fine bowling effort to send Lancashire out of the C&amp;G Trophy, despite Lancashire's Australian Marcus North taking three wickets. North's bowling – and others, Sajid Mahmood took two wickets – set Warwickshire back to 155 for 7, but Michael Powell and Trevor Frost put on an eighth-wicket partnership of 81 runs to carry Warwickshire to a total of 236 for 8 after 50 overs. Lancashire looked on track when Mal Loye and Stuart Law negotiated some tricky early bowling to put on 49 for the fourth wicket and see the score to 80 for 3, but medium pacer Jamie Anyon took two wickets, and a fiery spell from Neil Carter, which included two wickets to see him end with four for 26, had Lancashire bowled out for 137.\nLeicestershire v Warwickshire (22 August).\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled; Leicestershire (2pts), Warwickshire (2pts)\nLeicestershire Foxes and Warwickshire Bears were looking to fight it out for a spot in the top three, but rain made play impossible at Grace Road, and the teams shared the spoils.\nWarwickshire v Sussex (23 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by five wickets\nSussex Sharks opened up a four-point gap after a spell of left-arm spin bowling from Michael Yardy yielded the last six wickets of Warwickshire Bears' innings for 27 runs, the best bowling figures in Division Two of the National League all season. Earlier, Sussex pacer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan had made inroads with three wickets for 25, and it was only the 73-run partnership between Alex Loudon and Michael Powell that got Warwickshire past 100. Yardy's six-for left Warwickshire all out for 169, however, and in the chase Sussex were troubled by Makhaya Ntini's fast bowling as both opening batsmen were removed and Sussex crumbled to 16 for 2. However, Zimbabwean Murray Goodwin scored a solid, two-hour 86 not out, and guided the team to the target, putting on 82 with Robin Martin-Jenkins after spinner Alex Loudon had taken two wickets to set Sussex back to 91 for 5.\nWarwickshire v Sussex (25–28 August).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Sussex (8pts) by 101 runs\nFor once, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan went wicketless on the first day, and thus Sussex lost the match and the Championship lead at Edgbaston. Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott, who had made a career best 152 two weeks previously, now notched up his third first class century of the season as he carried his team to 329 for 7 on the first day. Trott continued on the second, and was eventually last out, having shattered his previous highest score and gone on to make 210 before he was bowled by Rana. Warwickshire were thus all out for 475, Mushtaq Ahmed and James Kirtley taking three wickets each, and Warwickshire got a good start with the ball as Makhaya Ntini and Dougie Brown removed an opener each. However, Michael Yardy, Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams all made solid contributions as Sussex moved to 244 for 3 at stumps on day two.\nThe third day saw a total of sixteen wickets fall, as Sussex came back to dismiss Warwickshire for a low score after giving up a 47-run lead on first innings. Goodwin made 150, his fourth century of the season, as Sussex scored 428, while most of the Warwickshire bowlers got wickets but conceded plenty of runs in the process. Then, Rana set out to repair his poor first innings effort, taking four wickets in 15 overs as Warwickshire could only muster 180 – and that was mostly thanks to a 50-run partnership between Trevor Frost and Brown. Sussex needed 228 to win, but collapsed. Wickets were shared out among the entire Warwickshire team, James Anyon getting the most with four for 33, and Makhaya Ntini, Neil Carter and Alex Loudon also got two each, to see Sussex all out for 126.\nHampshire v Warwickshire (30 August – 1 September).\nHampshire (22pts) beat Warwickshire (4pts) by an innings and 86 runs\nHampshire dominated proceedings against Warwickshire at The Rose Bowl, occupying the crease for a day and a half to amass 576 runs in their first innings. The top three of James Adams, Sean Ervine and John Crawley set the tone with fifties, and when Crawley departed for 60 the score had moved to 279 for 3. Jonathan Trott and Makhaya Ntini shared three wickets before the end of the day, leaving Hampshire 353 for 6 overnight, but Shane Watson and Dimitri Mascarenhas shared a mammoth 234-run partnership for the seventh wicket. Watson hit a career-best 203 not out, while Mascarenhas took three hours for an unbeaten 102, the first century of his season, before Shaun Udal declared. Warwickshire stumbled early on, falling to 21 for 2, but an unbeaten 97 from Nick Knight lifted them to 145 for 4 at the close of play on day two.\nKnight could not save Warwickshire alone, though, and Warwickshire lost sixteen wickets on the third day to crumble to an innings defeat. Knight got his century, ending with 116, but no other batsman passed 30, as they were all out for 258 in the first innings. They were asked to follow on 318 behind, and did rather well initially, getting the score to 110 for 1 after two hours. Then, Jonathan Trott and Ian Westwood fell in quick succession, leaving Jamie Troughton to try and tie together a match-saving innings with the lower order. He made a two-hour 76 before being ninth out, caught off Shaun Udal's bowling, ending Warwickshire's resistance. No further runs were added for the tenth wicket, as Makhaya Ntini was bowled by Udal, and Warwickshire ended on 232 all out – 86 runs short of making Hampshire bat again. Hampshire captain Udal finished with a second innings analysis of 22–8–44–6, after only one wicket in the first innings. The win left Hampshire briefly on top of the Championship, before Nottinghamshire took over the following day.\nHampshire v Warwickshire (3 September).\nHampshire won by 18 runs and won the C&amp;G Trophy\nHampshire became the third team to win a major county trophy in 2005, as they prevailed in a high-scoring final at Lord's, leaving only the County Championship left for grabs. Nic Pothas and Sean Ervine added 136 runs for the second wicket to propel Hampshire to a big total against Warwickshire, whose bowlers gave away 20 runs from wides but still managed to bowl Hampshire out on the last ball. Ervine was fifth out, taking 91 balls for his second successive C&amp;G century, before he was caught off Jonathan Trott, who finished with three wickets for 35 runs. Neil Carter took five wickets to redeem his 66 conceded runs, while Makhaya Ntini bowled two maiden overs for Warwickshire, but went wicketless.\nWarwickshire were set to chase 291 to win, and Carter fulfilled his job as a pinch hitter well, scoring four fours and one six en route to 32, and Nick Knight and Ian Bell kept up with the required run rate well. However, Bell suffered cramps just before he reached 50, and that limited his movements – he succumbed shortly afterwards, chipping a simple catch to Chris Tremlett and was gone for 54. The other batsmen tried to add runs with Knight, but yielded to the Hampshire bowling and fielding effort, and when Knight was finally dismissed for 118 Warwickshire needed 40 runs for the last three wickets. Shane Watson effectively stopped that, having Dougie Brown and Ashley Giles out bowled, leaving Warwickshire to hit about 20 runs in the last over. It was too much for Makhaya Ntini, who was bowled by Chris Tremlett with the second ball of the last over, and thus Hampshire took an 18-run victory.\nSomerset v Warwickshire (5 September).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by four wickets\nJonathan Trott set up Warwickshire Bears for a big total at Taunton, making 112 not out as Warwickshire eased to 278 for 5, also helped by scores in the 40s from Neil Carter, Nick Knight and Trevor Penney. Somerset Sabres scored quickly in reply, Matthew Wood spending 39 balls for his 53 before being bowled by Trott, but at 187 for 6, the odds were long. However, Will Durston and John Francis added 94 for the seventh wicket, as Somerset won with an over to spare. Warwickshire's opening bowler Dougie Brown only bowled two of a possible nine overs, conceding 23 runs.\nWarwickshire v Surrey (10–13 September).\nWarwickshire (10pts) drew with Surrey (8pts)\nAlmost one and a half days was lost to rain at Edgbaston, but when play finally got underway, Surrey tried their best to force a result – needing a win in this match to avoid losing too much ground to Middlesex in the relegation battle. As a result, seven of the dismissals were outfield catches, as Surrey were bowled out for 225 in the 60 overs possible on day two. Hosts Warwickshire started strongly, Ian Westwood and Nick Knight adding 93 for the first wicket, but Jade Dernbach had two men bowled as Surrey started to eye a hope. Scores of 60 from Alex Loudon and Michael Powell, along with 117 from Knight, saw Warwickshire to 338, a lead of 113. Losing three wickets early, Surrey went on the defensive in order not to lose further points, and 127 from Mark Ramprakash along with solid contributions from Rikki Clarke and wicket-keeper Jonathan Batty lifted them to 313 for 5. Surrey declared when Ramprakash was dismissed, giving Warwickshire 11 overs to bat, and Knight and Westwood batted out without loss to draw the game.\nWarwickshire v Surrey (14 September).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by 68 runs\nWarwickshire Bears hammered the Surrey Lions' bowlers at Edgbaston, which resulted in the Bears recording 292 for 8 batting first. Neil Carter set that pace, taking eleven fours in a blitzing thirty-ball 51 – his fourth half-century in List A cricket. Jade Dernbach had him caught, however, but that did not stop Warwickshire, as Jamie Troughton slashed five sixes and six fours before brothers Tim and Chris Murtagh combined to remove him for 82 – caught Chris, bowled Tim. However, Troughton had added 144 with Jonathan Trott, and not even four late wickets from Rikki Clarke could stop the flow of runs, and both Jade Dernbach and Azhar Mahmood conceded 61 in their nine overs. Surrey had six batsmen going into double figures in their reply, but no partnership was worth 50, as Jamie Anyon and Trott got three wickets each. Extras were the second highest scorer, with 32, behind Clarke's 42.\nScotland v Warwickshire (18 September).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Scotland (0pts) by five wickets\nWarwickshire Bears kept their promotion hopes alive with a win over Scottish Saltires, although the Scots kept them at bat for 41.4 overs at their home ground, The Grange. Fraser Watts and Ian Stanger both hit half-centuries for Scotland, as the Saltires made their way to 177 for 1, and despite two wickets from Jamie Anyon and the golden duck from West Indian Vasbert Drakes, the Scots ended on 220 for 5. However, Jonathan Trott and Nick Knight shared a swift 109-run stand for the second wicket to see Warwickshire to 151 for 1, and Knight made his 29th List A century as Warwickshire won by five wickets. Drakes, playing in his first match for Scotland, got two wickets for 30 on Scotland debut, while Ian Stanger got two for 26.\nWarwickshire v Yorkshire (20 September).\nWarwickshire (4pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by 102 runs\nYorkshire Phoenix conceded 309 for 3 after winning the toss and fielding first at Edgbaston despite Scotsman John Blain taking two early wickets to leave the hosts Warwickshire Bears at 49 for 2. Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell struck 216 runs together, with Bell being the most destructive – he hit eight fours and five sixes in an 84-ball century, and added a further 37 before Yorkshire wicket-keeper Simon Guy finally had him stumped. With Jamie Troughton smacking three sixes and two fours in a 13-ball 34, Warwickshire made 309 for 3 in their 45 overs, the sixth highest total in Division Two this season. Yorkshire attempted the chase, with Michael Wood and Anthony McGrath hitting at just under a run a ball, but after McGrath's dismissal Yorkshire lost five wickets for 34, and only just managed to bat out their 45 overs, scoring 207 for 9. Alex Loudon and Neil Carter took three wickets each.\nWarwickshire v Gloucestershire (21–24 September).\nWarwickshire (18pts) beat Gloucestershire (3pts) by 181 runs\nWarwickshire came back from 18 for 3 and then 90 for 5 to win their last Championship game of the season. A two-hour partnership yielding 70 runs between Jamie Troughton and Trevor Frost took Warwickshire past 150, before Sri Lankan Malinga Bandara removed four of the last five wickets, and Warwickshire ended on 208 all out. However, early wickets taken by Neil Carter and Dougie Brown sent Gloucestershire to 29 for 3 at the close of play on day one. Warwickshire continued to chip away on the second day, as five bowlers shared the remaining seven wickets, and Gloucestershire were bowled out for 118. South African-born first class debutant Grant Hodnett was the only one to pass 20 for Gloucestershire, taking three hours before falling one short of a half-century on debut. Ian Westwood did manage a fifty, hitting 55 in a 94-run stand with Nick Knight, and Warwickshire closed on 197 for 3. Despite four wickets from Malinga Bandara, Warwickshire managed 320 for 9 before declaring.\nGloucestershire attempted to chase a total of 411 to win, but after an opening stand of 80 Naqqash Tahir removed both openers in quick succession, and Gloucestershire closed on 97 for 2. Off spinner Alex Loudon then celebrated his call-up to the England team to tour Pakistan the following winter by taking six for 66 as Gloucestershire were bowled out for 229.\nWarwickshire v Durham (25 September).\nDurham (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by eight wickets on the Duckworth-Lewis method\nEarly wickets and few runs early on meant that Warwickshire Bears posted 187 for 8 at their home ground, Edgbaston. Australian Brad Williams took two wickets for the Durham Dynamos, as Warwickshire lost their first four wickets for 43, and despite a run-a-ball 48 from number 8 Dougie Brown, Warwickshire never got the run rate up above 4.5 an over. Durham lost Gordon Muchall for 3, but half-centuries from Australian Jimmy Maher and England all-rounder Paul Collingwood put Durham to a score of 135 for 2, and Durham passed the revised target of 154 with 17 balls to spare."

        "text": "The 2005 English cricket season was the 106th in which the County Championship had been an official competition. Before it began, a resurgent England cricket team had won four Test series in a row, going unbeaten through the 2004 calendar year. The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. Australia still started the Test series as favourites but most fans expected England to put up a challenge.\nDespite losing the first Test by 239 runs. England came back to win the second and fourth Tests, and draw the third and fifth, to win the Ashes for the first time since 1986–87. It was the 72nd test series between the two sides with England finally winning 2-1. Andrew Flintoff dominated with both bat and ball for England, scoring 402 runs – more than any Australian – and taking 24 wickets – more than any Australian bar Shane Warne. Warne also had a spectacular series, with 40 wickets at a bowling average of 19.92, and 249 runs, but most of his efforts came in losing causes – such as making 42 with the bat in the second innings of the second Test.\nIn domestic cricket, Nottinghamshire won the County Championship, for the first time since 1987, and Durham enjoyed promotion in both the shorter and the longer form of the game. Surrey, the 2000 and 2002 Championship winners, were relegated in the Championship, and played in Division Two in both the Championship and the National League in 2006. Hampshire Hawks won the 50-over knock-out C&amp;G Trophy, but were relegated in the National League, which Essex Eagles won in emphatic fashion, as they lost only one game and had a 14-point gap to the runners-up, Middlesex Crusaders.\nThe Australian women also toured England at the same time as the men, and England won the Women's Ashes 1–0 after two Tests. However, the Australian women won the ODI series 3–2. To round off the season, investors in partnership with Leicestershire arranged an , which Pakistani side Faisalabad Wolves won.\nRoll of honour.\nTest series:\nODI series:\nTwenty20 International:\nCounty Championship:\nTotesport (one-day) League:\nC&amp;G Trophy:\nTwenty20 Cup:\nWomen's Tests:\nWomen's ODIs:\nWomen's Twenty20 Internationals:\nUnder-19s \"Tests\":\nUnder-19s \"ODIs\":\nMonth by Month review.\nApril.\nThe cricket season started early, on 8 April, with MCC playing the Champion County, or at least it would have done if the rain had not delayed the start till the next day. The other games played were all between the first-class counties and university sides. The first matches showed a bumper crop of centuries, with little joy for bowlers, but there were no surprises. The MCC ended up beating Warwickshire.\nAway from the cricket field, on 8 April the ECB announced that triangular One Day International tournaments would no longer be played in England. On 11 April Kevin Pietersen, England's South African-born all-rounder was reported to have a foot injury that could see him miss the start of the season, and Chris Schofield began his case for unfair dismissal against Lancashire, which he eventually won.\nThe first round of the Frizzell County Championship saw Warwickshire gain maximum points, with Hampshire also winning in Division One. Durham replicated Warwickshire's feat in Division Two, where Worcestershire also won.\nThe first round of the totesport National Cricket League was held on 17 April, though most of the games were affected by the rain. 5 results were possible in the 8 matches. Rain continued to bedevil the second round of the County Championship, with only Yorkshire and Durham securing wins. In the MCC University matches, Bradford/Leeds UCCE shocked an injury-weakened Surrey by beating them at the Oval.\nThe second round of the totesport League saw a heavy defeat for Surrey away to Durham, with other wins for Northamptonshire, Middlesex, Kent and Sussex, which left Middlesex and Durham at the top of the tables at the end of April.\nIn the third round of the Championship, Surrey thrashed what already appear to be Division One whipping boys Glamorgan to go third, with Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire also recording big wins to go second and first respectively. In the second division, Essex and Lancashire beat Somerset and Worcestershire respectively. However, Durham, who sat this round out, led the table at the end of April, from Essex and Worcestershire, with Derbyshire and Leicestershire propping the table up.\nMay.\nMay started with one-day games played on 1 and 2 May. Middlesex established themselves at the top of Division One after winning their first three matches. Yorkshire and Durham were the unbeaten sides in the Second Division. This was followed by the first round of the C&amp;G Trophy, which for the last time included the minor counties and Scotland, Holland, Denmark and Ireland. However, there were no upsets. Durham lost to Derbyshire by 1 wicket, and Leicestershire beat Somerset by 3 wickets in the only all first-class county fixtures.\nThe fourth round of the Championship saw Gloucestershire sent Glamorgan down for another heavy defeat., as title contenders Hampshire and Nottinghamshire win against Middlesex and Surrey respectively. Surrey were found guilty of ball-tampering in this match, which later led to all their cricketers being fined by Surrey, and to the loss of 8 Championship points. The Second Division saw wins for Durham, Essex, Lancashire and Yorkshire. Whilst these games were being played Loughborough UCCE chalked up the second victory for a UCCE side this season by thrashing Worcestershire by 8 wickets in a game the students dominated in throughout.\nOn 10 May the Bangladeshis got their tour off with a three-day game against the British Universities, which was drawn. The fifth round of the Championship saw Surrey dish out another defeat to Glamorgan as Middlesex and Sussex won. The Second Division saw Durham maintaining their lead at the top with a 9 wicket win against Lancashire. Worcestershire overcame bottom club Derbyshire, with Yorkshire beating Leicestershire in the only other decided game.\nEssex, Lancashire, Hampshire, Worcestershire and Durham all won their totesport games on 15 May, with Leicestershire beating Surrey to continue Surrey's dismal form. The quarter-finals of the C&amp;G Trophy followed, as did a tour match between the Bangladeshi's and Sussex in which the tourists lost by an innings and 226 runs, boding ill for the impending Test series. On 20 May Surrey finally won a totesport League game, beating fellow wooden spoon candidates, Scotland, in Edinburgh by five wickets.\n20 May saw the start of another Championship round. Glamorgan lost yet again, this time to Hampshire, and in the other first division tie, Kent beat Nottinghamshire by 196 runs. Division Two saw Worcestershire beat Essex, as first-placed Durham drew with second-placed Yorkshire, and Lancashire drew at Somerset. At the same time, Bangladesh put up a stronger performance in Northampton in a match severely hampered by rain. The last round of the County Championship in May saw Nottinghamshire beat Gloucestershire to finish may top of Division One. Warwickshire beat Hampshire by ten wickets to leave them third and second in the table respectively, as Kent and Surrey drew to keep them in fourth and fifth. The table remains propped up by Glamorgan, who are strong favourites for relegation, with Sussex, Middlesex and Gloucestershire in places six to eight. Durham did not play in this round of the Championship, but remained in first place in Division Two, with Yorkshire missing a chance of taking over as leaders when they drew with Essex. Also in the round Somerset beat Northamptonshire and eighth placed Leicestershire beat ninth- (and bottom-) placed Derbyshire.\nThe Test match season finally started on 26 May, with Bangladesh completely overwhelmed in just over two days. After being dismissed for 108, Bangladesh could only watch as England made 528 for 3 declared, Marcus Trescothick top-scoring with 194. In their second innings, the tourists could only muster 159 as they went down by a mammoth innings and 261 runs. The one-day league games played over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend left Middlesex top of Division One, with Essex one win behind them with two games in hand. Gloucestershire, Hampshire and Nottinghamshire (who had not won a game by the end of May) were in the relegation spots. As with the County Championship, Durham led the Second Division from Yorkshire, with Derbyshire, Scotland and Leicestershire occupying the bottom three places.\nJune.\nThe eighth round of the Championship saw Hampshire beat title rivals Nottinghamshire and Kent beat Gloucestershire, and then lose 8 points for the poor quality of the Maidstone pitch. The other First Division matches were draws, with Glamorgan avoiding defeat after following-on against Sussex. The Second Division saw four draws. Meanwhile, the students of Cambridge UCCE edged past Middlesex by 2 wickets. The Second Test against Bangladesh at Chester-le-Street was another one-sided affair. 5 wickets from Stephen Harmison, on his home ground, helped dismiss the Bangladeshis for 104. Trescothick's 151, Ian Bell's 162* and Graham Thorpe's 66* saw England to 447 for 3 declared. Although Bangladesh did better in their second innings, their 316 saw them lose by an innings and 27 runs.\nAfter another totesport League round, the top division of the Championship continued with Kent thrashing Glamorgan, Warwickshire thrashing Gloucestershire and local rivals Surrey and Middlesex drawing. In the Second Division, Durham pulled away further at the top with another win, this time against Essex, with Worcestershire also scoring a win against Somerset. However, the main focus was on the warm-up games for the NatWest Series and the first ever Twenty20 International between England and Australia. The only surprise in the warm-ups was a welcome win for Bangladesh over Worcestershire, which provided a welcome confidence boost to the Bangladeshis before they took on England and Australia in the NatWest Series.\nThe Twenty20 International on 13 June saw England score 179 for 8, a total probably 20 above the par score at the Rose Bowl. The Australian innings was a dream for Darren Gough (3 wickets), Jon Lewis (4 wickets) and all Englishmen as the Aussies were reduced to 31 for 7. Ultimately they were dismissed for 79 – first blood to England by 100 runs. Lord's hosted a 50-over match between the next day as part of the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal to raise funds to help countries hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December. An MCC side including Shaun Pollock, Sourav Ganguly and Stephen Fleming beat an International XI that included Brian Lara, Rahul Dravid, Shane Warne and Graeme Smith by 112 runs. Then on 15 June came another surprise – Australia were beaten in their final NatWest Series warm-up match by Somerset, or more specifically Graeme Smith and Sanath Jayasuriya, who put on 197 for Somerset's first wicket.\nThe first NatWest series match saw England easily defeat Bangladesh at the Oval by 10 wickets. The last County Championship round before the mid-season Twenty20 break saw Surrey beat Hampshire, Middlesex beat Glamorgan, Kent beat Warwickshire and Sussex and Nottinghamshire draw to leave Kent top, and Glamorgan bottom of the first division. In the second division, Lancashire beat Derbyshire, who remain bottom; Leicestershire beat second-placed Worcestershire; and leaders Durham drew with Northamptonshire. The last round of the totesport League before the break left Essex and Middlesex at the top of Division One, with Nottinghamshire and Gloucestershire propping them up. Durham held top place in Division Two, with Surrey languishing one place below Scotland at the bottom.\nThe second NatWest match on 18 June saw what many described as the biggest-ever upset in one-day cricket, and wild celebrations in Dhaka as Bangladesh restricted World Champions Australia to 249 for 5, before Mohammed Ashraful's 100 assisted the Bangladeshis in reaching their target with four balls and five wickets spare. With England scoring a narrow three wicket victory against Australia, the Aussies finished the weekend bottom of the NatWest table, with England well on top. 20 June saw the second tsunami appeal match of the season, this time a Twenty20 affair at the Oval. An Asian XI including Dravid, Muralitharan and Harbhajan Singh scored 157 in an innings finished with a hat-trick from Adam Hollioake. The total was easily surpassed with Greg Blewett's 91 meaning that Stephen Fleming's duck and Brian Lara's 9 could not prevent the International XI winning by 6 wickets with 11 balls left.\nThe fourth NatWest Series match saw normal service resumed, with England beating Bangladesh by 168 runs after the hosts put on 391 for 4, the second-highest score in ODIs. The 2005 Twenty20 Cup started on 22 June, again with large audiences, and with last year's winners, Leicestershire, and runners-up, Surrey, both scoring wins. The fifth ODI allowed Australia back in, with a comfortable 57 win against England. Any anticipation over the next Australia v Bangladesh tie was easily brushed aside by the Aussies, who struck out Bangladesh for 139, and then reached their target in 19 overs without losing a wicket. Bangladesh were eliminated from the Series in the seventh ODI, when England beat them by five wickets. The eighth match should have been a rehearsal for the final, and Australia's 261 for 9 set the stage well. But rain was always expected and the contest was rained off as a \"no result\" with England 37 for 1 off 6 overs in their reply. Bangladesh's tour of England ended with a creditable performance against Australia in the ninth ODI, although their 250 for 8 was ultimately overcome by the Aussie with six wickets and eleven balls left after they had wobbled earlier in the innings. At the same time, the Twenty20 Cup was continuing apace, and Oxford University (610 for 5 declared) beat Cambridge University (129 and 268), with Salil Oberoi's 247 gaining positive comment in his native India.\nJuly.\nJuly began with Twenty20 Cup group games, before England tied the final of the NatWest Series after coming back from 33 for 5 to post 196 for 9 – the same as Australia – on 2 July. Two days later, Lancashire became the first team to qualify for the Twenty20 Cup quarter-finals, and the following day Northamptonshire and Surrey joined them.\nThe final round of the group stage of the Twenty20 Cup was played on 6 July. Middlesex made it through from the South Division despite loss – while Sussex, Middlesex' conquerors, were knocked out. Warwickshire and Somerset qualified from the Midlands/Wales/West Division thanks to wins over Northamptonshire and Gloucestershire respectively, while Derbyshire sneaked through from the North Division after a win over Nottinghamshire, and Leicestershire defeated Yorkshire to join them.\nIn the NatWest Challenge, a three-ODI series played over five days, England won the first ODI but lost the next two to lose the series 1–2, their only tournament loss in the entire season. In the County Championship, Nottinghamshire enjoyed the lead in Division One for a couple of days after beating Glamorgan by ten wickets – Glamorgan's eighth loss – but Kent, whose match started on 10 July took it back despite losing to Sussex, the six bonus points being enough to take the lead. In Division Two of the Championship, Durham's lead was closed from 21 points to 11 after losing to Lancashire by an innings and 228 runs, the highest margin of victory thus far in the season.\nThe following day, Surrey got off the last place in Division Two of the totesport League thanks to a three-run victory over Yorkshire, but Surrey were knocked out of the C&amp;G Trophy on 15 July – Hampshire, Lancashire, Warwickshire and Yorkshire reached the semi-finals. Three days later, the quarter-finals of the Twenty20 Cup were held, and Lancashire, Leicestershire, Somerset and Surrey proceeded to the semi-finals at The Oval on 30 July.\nIn the National League, Essex Eagles beat Lancashire Lightning by eight wickets on 19 July to extend their lead in the first division to eight points with one game in hand. The next round of Championship matches saw Hampshire, Kent, Nottinghamshire and Middlesex record victories to form the top four on 23 July. In Division Two, Northamptonshire and Yorkshire recorded wins, while the top sides Durham and Lancashire drew to remain on top.\nHowever, the eyes of most cricket fans were on Lord's, where England took on Australia. Glenn McGrath worried the English batsmen to end with nine wickets for 82, and Australia recorded their highest team score of the entire series with their second-innings 384 as they completed a 239-run victory on the fourth day of the Test.\nEngland Under-19s began their three-ODI series with Sri Lanka Under-19s on 26 July, with a win, before they travelled to Old Trafford where they played out a no-result and a win to take the series 2–0. In the County Championship, there were four draws in five matches, as rain thwarted play on the first three days of the round from 26 to 29 July. Division Two leaders Durham were the only team to win after beating Somerset at the Riverside.\nThe month was rounded off with the finals day of the Twenty20 Cup on 30 July, where Lancashire Lightning beat Surrey Lions in the first match, amassing 217 for 4 to win by 20 runs, before Somerset Sabres eked through in the second semi-final after a four-run victory. In the final, however, Graeme Smith hit 64 not out for the Sabres, and Somerset won by four wickets to take their first Twenty20 Cup win.\nAugust.\nAugust began with the Australian tourists completing a draw against Worcestershire in a three-day tour match, while Sussex Sharks kept up their good National League run with a win over Somerset Sabres, their seventh win in succession. Six matches in the Championship started on 3 August, with Kent, Sussex, Warwickshire and Hampshire recording victories. In Division Two, Lancashire used their victory at Grace Road in Leicestershire to exploit a rare slip-up from Durham and grab 16 points in the title-battle, closing the gap to 18 with a game in hand.\nHowever, the Championship matches came in the background due to the second Ashes Test, where England took on Australia at Edgbaston Cricket Ground for the second Test of the five-match series. England carried a 0–1 series deficit into Edgbaston, and after three days of cricket England led by 106 with two Australian wickets left to grab. Shane Warne, Brett Lee (Australia's top-scorer with 43 not out) and Michael Kasprowicz cut 104 of those runs off the target, but Kasprowicz gloved Steve Harmison behind to Geraint Jones, to leave England 2-run winners and the series tied at one-all.\nThe English youth team were the first English representative team to record a Test victory this summer, however, beating Sri Lanka by 220 runs in an Under-19 Test two days before England seniors defeated Australia. On 6 August, Essex Eagles took control of Division One of the National League after eking out a four-run win over Middlesex Crusaders, and three days later the second Under-19 Test and the first women's Test began – the first ended in an England win, almost as convincing as the first Test, while Arran Brindle scored a maiden Test century to save the draw for England Women. The Ashes battle recommenced on 11 August, and after two English centuries – 166 from Michael Vaughan and a second-innings 106 from Andrew Strauss – Ricky Ponting played a rearguard 156 to save the draw.\nThere were also matches in the Championship during the Test – rain played a major part, however, and four of seven matches ended in draws, including the top of the table battle in Division One between Kent and Hampshire. Kent gained two bonus points over Hampshire, however, and now led by 17 points. Another National League round on 15 August saw the table-toppers in Division 1, Essex Eagles, fell to 122 and a 60-run loss against Gloucestershire Gladiators, while Sussex Sharks suffered their second successive loss in Division Two. England's youth team also completed their series, whitewashing Sri Lanka with a 173-run win in the final Test.\nThe following day, five Championship matches began, including a drawn Roses match between Lancashire and Yorkshire, while Sussex went top of Division One after beating Middlesex inside two days. On 18 August, Australia were scheduled to play Scotland in a match that was to be broadcast on BBC – however, the match was rained off, giving the Australians even less time to warm up. Two days later, they began a drawn two-day friendly game with Northamptonshire, on the same day as the C&amp;G Trophy semi-finals. Warwickshire and Hampshire took convincing victories to reach the final. Meanwhile, in the Midlands, Australia's women played two ODIs with England on 19 August and 21 August, winning the first after bowling England out for 128 to go 2–0 up in the series, but losing the second by a two-run margin. There were also a total of ten National League matches from 21 August to 24 August – three were rained off, while the Sharks took a four-point lead in Division Two despite losing their first match with Leicestershire Foxes.\nCounty Championship cricket began again on 24 August, with eight matches played in this period. Four were drawn, but Division One table-toppers Sussex fell to a 101-run defeat against Warwickshire as their Pakistani overseas player Rana Naved-ul-Hasan went wicketless in the first innings. Lancashire also recorded a win to go second in Division Two, six points off leaders Durham with a game in hand.\nOn the international stage, England and Australia began their battle for the Ashes once again on 25 August, where England chased 129 to win with seven wickets down after earning a 259-run lead on first innings and becoming the first team to ask Australia to follow on in 17 years. The men's win got much more media coverage than the women's first Ashes victory since 1963, achieved through a six-wicket victory in the second and final Test inspired by the all-round efforts of Katherine Brunt (who took nine wickets and made 52 runs in her only innings).\nMore National League games followed, with Essex Eagles securing the title thanks to a 12-run win over C&amp;G Trophy finalists Hampshire Hawks, while Sussex Sharks ended the month with wins over Scottish Saltires and Surrey Lions to take a ten-point lead in Division Two, though with second-placed Durham Dynamos having two games in hand. The County Championship also moved towards its conclusion, with Nottinghamshire and Hampshire recording wins on the matches that started on 30 August to take the top two spots in the Division One table. In Division Two, Derbyshire came close to breaking their winless streak when they finished three runs short of a winning total against Durham, and had to settle for a draw; runners-up Lancashire lost further ground in the title battle through a 285-run defeat at the hands of Northamptonshire.\nSeptember.\nSeptember began with Australia's women recording a four-run win in the final ODI of the five-match series – Clare Connor out as last woman when England needed five to win off the last over. Karen Rolton then hit 96 not out in the second women's Twenty20 international ever to be played, as Australia won by seven wickets. On 3 September, Hampshire batted first to make 290 in the C&amp;G Trophy final, and Andy Bichel, Shane Watson and Chris Tremlett combined to bowl their final opponents Warwickshire out for 272 to win the Trophy, becoming the third club to win a major trophy in England this season. Meanwhile, former England Under-19 player Alastair Cook took the Australian bowlers on for 270 in a drawn non-first class tour match.\nThere were National League games from 4 September to 6 September, and Sussex Sharks became the first team to promote from Division Two, despite not even playing. In the Championship, Nottinghamshire began their match two days early, and completed an innings defeat inside two days to take a 23.5-point lead over second-placed Hampshire. Hampshire had a bye, however, so Sussex took the opportunity to go second with a two-day victory over Glamorgan. Nottinghamshire had a game in hand and 10 points on Sussex, however, and their only challenge looked to come from Kent, who drew their match with Middlesex to be third in the table, trailing by 19.5 points with the same number of games as Nottinghamshire.\nThe final Test match of the season started on 8 September with England needing a draw or better to win back the Ashes after 16 years of Australian domination. England opener Andrew Strauss made a first-innings century, which was matched by his Australian counterpart Matthew Hayden, who ground out his hundred from 218 balls and went on to top score with 138. However, Andrew Flintoff and Matthew Hoggard grabbed the last nine wickets for 103 runs as Australia were bowled out six overs into the fourth day afternoon. Going into the second innings with a 4-run lead, England fell to 199 for 7, but Ashley Giles held out for his fourth Test half-century and a 109-run stand with Kevin Pietersen – who made the series' second-highest score with 158 to give England a total of 335. Australia walked off after three minutes in their second innings, to give England the draw and the 2–1 series victory.\nMeanwhile, in the County Championship, Lancashire assumed the ascendancy of Division Two with an eight-wicket win over Essex which also secured their return to Division One after only one season on the lowest rung of the Championship ladder. National League losses for Worcestershire Royals and Hampshire Hawks then left four teams on 22 points in the bottom of Division One – three of them would have to go down.\nNottinghamshire and Kent then faced off for the match that would decide the County Championship title, with Kent trailing by 19.5 points before the match at Trent Bridge. Kent failed to chase 420 in five hours, and Nottinghamshire recorded a 214-run win to take the Championship title. Durham and Yorkshire also secured Championship promotion with draws, while the first was won by Faisalabad Wolves after a five-wicket win over Chilaw Marians in the final.\nIn the National League, Warwickshire Bears won three matches in seven days to go third in the Division Two table before the final round, with Derbyshire Phantoms the only team that had a theoretical possibility of catching the Bears. Lancashire Lightning and Worcestershire Royals both lost in Division One, leaving them tied on points with two other teams at the bottom of the table. The final round of the Championship saw Hampshire beat the newly crowned county champions Nottinghamshire by an innings and 188 runs, their second win over Nottinghamshire in the Championship this year, but they still finished 2.5 points behind. Surrey were relegated after conceding too many bonus points to Middlesex, and a total of four innings victories were registered on the final matchday.\nThe season ended with nine National League matches – Lancashire Lightning survived in Division One after beating Worcestershire Royals, while Gloucestershire Gladiators were relegated despite a win. Warwickshire Bears confirmed promotion, despite losing to Durham Dynamos, while Scottish Saltires played their last National League game, losing by eight wickets."

        "title": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005",
        "text": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005 are playing their cricket in Division One of both the County Championship and totesport League. They started the Championship at 18–1 to win it, and as one of the teams most likely to be relegated from it. So they were—only their five draws prevented them from finishing bottom, and they were the only team to lose to bottom-placed Glamorgan. By the end of August, they were relegated, with three games to spare. In the National League, they were never better than sixth at any time during the season, and lost three games in succession to be ninth before the final round of matches. They won their last match, but were still relegated due to a worse net run rate than Lancashire. They were thus the first club to suffer double relegation since Leicestershire in 2003. Their Twenty20 and C&amp;G Trophy campaigns ended almost as early as they could have done—Gloucestershire did get past the first round of the C&amp;G Trophy, beating Berkshire, but were knocked out by Surrey.\nGloucestershire played 18 first-class matches in 2005, winning two, drawing six and losing ten. In List A cricket, they won seven, lost ten and abandoned one game, while eight Twenty20 matches resulted in three wins, three losses and two no-results.\nMatch details.\nApril.\nTheir first first-class game was against Oxford UCCE, and Gloucestershire used it as batting practice. This was followed by a defeat by 48 runs in their first Championship game, away to Hampshire, and a defeat in the Sunday League at home to Northamptonshire. Gloucestershire then drew with Kent in the Championship.\nMCC University Match: Oxford UCCE v Gloucestershire (9–11 April).\nMatch drawn\nOxford Universities Cricketing Centre of Excellence and Gloucestershire started their 2005 first-class season at the Parks in Oxford on 9 April. Gloucestershire won the toss and chose to bat. They made 305 for 9 declared off 89.2 overs, Phil Weston's 103 making him the first Gloucestershire centurion of the season. The declaration left 9 overs for Oxford to bat through until the end of the first day. They were 21 for 2 at the close.\nOn the second day, Oxford UCCE collapsed to 116 all out. Gloucestershire chose batting practice rather than to enforce the follow-on. At close they were 262 for 1, with Craig Spearman undefeated on 170. In the final over, which was the first one Stephen Moreton had bowled in first-class cricket, Spearman scored 6,6,6,6,4 and 6, with Spearman being dropped twice. The innings continued on the third and last day, and Gloucestershire closed on 490 for 4 declared from 101 overs. Spearman had made 216 before he retired out. There were few overs in the day left, but victory for Gloucestershire looked on the cards when they reduced Oxford UCCE to 24 for 6. Then a rearguard undefeated 64 from Knappett and 22 from Woods rescued some pride for Oxford UCCE and saw them through for the draw. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Hampshire v Gloucestershire (13–16 April).\nHampshire (17pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by 48 runs\nHampshire won the toss and elected to bat. There were 1,200 at the Rose Bowl to watch Simon Katich flawless 72 not out, as he was the only one able to cope with the conditions as Hampshire were all out for 197 before tea. Katich's innings was one of defence coupled with the odd drive, hook and pull. Hampshire's meagre total suggests they miss Kevin Pietersen, who performed so well for England in the one-dayers against Zimbabwe and South Africa over the winter. Pietersen said of his foot injury, \"If I got a ball on my foot or I slipped I could be out for six to eight weeks. It's a bit tender and it's just a case of biding my time,\" he said. However, they did have to face good, fast-medium-pace bowling from Gloucestershire. Gloucestershire fared well in reply, and Shane Warne brought himself into the attack after only 18 overs. He took Craig Spearman's wicket when Spearman tried to sweep him, but Gloucestershire were sitting pretty at close on 118 for 2, 79 behind with 8 first-innings wickets remaining.\nOn the second day, Hampshire's bowlers, led by Warne, battled hard to get them back into the game. Except for Jon Lewis, who scored 40 off 61 balls batting at number ten, no one after the first three Gloucester batsmen scored more than ten. Their first innings ended for 221, just 24 ahead. Hampshire also struggled, and scored only 94 for their first 6 wickets. Warne and Sean Ervine survived the last six overs to push the score to 111 for 6 at close.\nThe third day saw yet another change in fortunes, which just about left Hampshire on top. The bowlers dominated the first two days, but the start of the third day was dominated by Hampshire's bowlers batting. Warne increased his score to 62, Chris Tremlett got 64 and Richard Logan 28 through aggressive batting as Hampshire closed their second innings on 275. This left Gloucestershire a challenging target of 252. Spearman and Phil Weston then put on 129 for the first wicket, only for five wickets to fall in quick succession before bad light stopped play, with the visitors on 149 for 5, needing 103 for victory.\nIt took only 18.4 overs on the fourth day for the match to be settled. With Billy Taylor finishing on 6 for 45 as Gloucester were all out for 203. After the game Hampshire's captain, Shane Warne, said, \"We believe we can win from any position and it's so important to win your first few games. It was a tremendous team effort and everyone pulled their weight. This is the type of game you never forget. We found ourselves behind the eight ball at the start of every day but I always felt we were in with a chance if we could remove their openers.\" Cricinfo scorecard\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Northamptonshire (24 April).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 9 runs\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks batted first at Bristol. Two quick wickets reduced them to 14 for 2. It was a slow pitch that was not conducive to a high score, but they made their way to 202 for 7 off their 45 overs, thanks in part to Damien Wright smashing three sixes in four balls in the penultimate over, and thanks to Gloucestershire Gladiators dropping three catches.\nIn reply Northamptonshire took wickets regularly leaving the hosts on 111 for 5. There was a recovery of sorts after that, led by Alex Gidman's 71, but the hosts were always on the back foot from there. Eventually they finished on 193 for 8, a deficit of 9 runs. Four Northamptonshire bowlers got two wickets each, Welshman Steffan Jones getting them for the fewest runs, as he conceded only 29. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Kent (27–30 April).\nGloucestershire (8pts) drew with Kent (11pts)\nPlay started at 4.30pm on the first day at Bristol. Kent progressed to 66 for 2 at close, with Robert Key (26) and Matthew Walker (22) the not out batsmen. On the second day, Key and Walker proceeded to their centuries. Key top-scored with 164, an innings which gave him a good shout for the No.3 spot in the England national team. When Walker was third man out with the score on 260, it precipitated a minor collapse, and Kent finished the second day on 339 for 6.\nOn the third day Kent lost their last four wickets in 40 minutes, finishing on 359. Gloucestershire, however, lost wickets steadily, and would have lost more had Kent not dropped four chances. Chris Taylor, the Gloucester captain, was the mainstay of the innings with a painstaking 66 from 173 balls. They finished the day on 208 for 7, 2 away from saving the follow-on, and most probably the match as well.\nGloucestershire added 40 runs on the last day, and then Kent batted out the day for a draw, finishing on 229 for 5 declared. Walker and Stevens had time to score half-centuries, and Geraint Jones had some useful batting practice in getting to 36 not out, but there was never much prospect of a result once the follow-on was saved. Kent captain David Fulton said, \"If there had been any realistic chance of a result we would have been happy to go for it. But the pitch has just got flatter, and it was obvious we couldn't really hope to bowl them out quickly.\" (BBC scorecard)\nMay.\nThen on 2 May they beat Hampshire easily by 60 runs, before easily beat Berkshire over 2 days in the first round of the C&amp;G Trophy. The next two games were Championship encounters: a win over Division One whipping boys, Glamorgan and a defeat at Lord's to Middlesex. Little one-day practice may have been one of the reasons they lost by three wickets to Surrey in the C&amp;G Trophy, as they hadn't played a one-day game in two weeks. This one-day drought had also left them languishing near the bottom of the table, and a no-result against Middlesex didn't help. An innings defeat by Nottinghamshire followed, which left them eighth in Division One of the Championship at the end of May, and they ended the month with a League loss to Lancashire.\nNational League: Hampshire v Gloucestershire (2 May).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 60 runs\nJon Lewis won the game for Gloucestershire Gladiators with 40 runs off 28 balls with the bat, and then taking out the Hampshire Hawks top order by taking 5 for 19 with the ball. Lewis had come in as a pinch hitter at number four after Matt Windows retired hurt. It was the Gladiators won the toss at the Rose Bowl, Southampton and, thanks to Lewis and 63 from Phil Weston, they scored 210 for 9. Hampshire's innings was stopped by Lewis, and despite a 55-run partnership between John Crawley and Nic Pothas, it was never enough, and they finished on 150 all out. (BBC scorecard)\nC&amp;G Trophy Round One: Berkshire v Gloucestershire (3–4 May).\nGloucestershire beat Berkshire by 85 runs to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nBerkshire did well at their home ground in Reading. Despite 80 from Phil Weston, Gloucestershire only made 223 from 49.3 overs. Apart from a second-wicket partnership worth 118 between Weston and Chris Taylor, wickets fell regularly, leaving the minor county in with a clear chance. Berkshire progressed well in reply, reaching 69 for 2 off 14 overs when rain halted play for the day. On the second day, however, Berkshire soon capitulated to 138, as Sri Lankan spinner Upul Chandana took 4 for 27. The last eight wickets fell for 26 runs. (BBC scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Gloucestershire (6–9 May).\nGloucestershire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (4pts) by 7 wickets\nGloucestershire batted first at Cardiff and didn't regret it. With the top four all making good contributions and the three first partnerships all accounting for more than fifty runs, Chris Taylor smashed his way to 176 off 185 balls with four sixes, letting himself loose after getting his century and hitting over 70 runs with the last 43 balls he faced. By stumps, Gloucestershire were 439 for 8, and well in control of the game. England ODI bowler Alex Wharf did the brunt of the bowling effort with 30.1 overs, getting Taylor out eventually, and finishing with three wickets for 127 as Gloucestershire were bowled out for 466 early on the second day.\nMatthew Elliott and Ian Thomas started the reply well for the hosts Glamorgan, putting on 40 for the first wicket before Thomas departed, but the Gloucestershire seamers Jon Lewis and Alex Gidman utilised the conditions well to reduce Glamorgan to 48 for 4. Healthy and quick contributions from the lower order, led by wicketkeeper Mark Wallace, who made a half-century to lift Glamorgan to a slightly respectable 239. Following on, Glamorgan played more sensibly, and stumps were drawn when Glamorgan lost their first wicket of their second innings, Ian Thomas for 40.\nThe third day, however, was the day of the spinners. After Matt Elliott (123), David Hemp (57) and Michael Powell (39) lifted Glamorgan to 274 for 2 and a lead of 47, Sri Lankan leg-spinner Upul Chandana and all-rounder Ian Fisher shared the last eight wickets between them for 71 runs, Chandana finishing with five for 117 and Fisher with four for 89, and resulting in a target of 119 for Gloucestershire to win. Glamorgan had some hope when their spinners, Dean Cosker and Robert Croft took three wickets of their own to see Gloucestershire to 59 for 3 at close on day 3, but on the morning of day 4, there just wasn't any help left and Gloucestershire's experienced batsman Tim Hancock could guide the visitors to the target with a fine 41 not out.\nCounty Championship: Middlesex v Gloucestershire (11–13 May).\nMiddlesex (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by 340 runs\nMiddlesex won convincingly at Lord's. Ed Joyce continued with his good form, top-scoring with 75 as Middlesex made 390 all out, their highest score of the season so far, on the first day. Gloucestershire faced out a maiden over before the close of play. On the second day, in conditions still favouring the batsmen, 5 wickets from Alan Richardson and 4 from Melvyn Betts saw the visitors crumble to 232. Only Craig Spearman passed 30 for Gloucestershire, as he spent 144 minutes making 69. Middlesex were 93 for 3 in their second innings at stumps.\nMiddlesex batted for another 62 overs, allowing Owais Shah to make his century, and Ed Joyce 93, before declaring on 342 for 6, leaving Gloucestershire a theoretical 501 to win. Their batting was worse than in their first innings as another 3 wickets from Richardson and 4 from Betts saw them all out for a miserable 160. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nC&amp;G Trophy Round Two: Gloucestershire v Surrey (17 May).\nSurrey beat Gloucestershire by three wickets to progress to the quarter-finals of the C &amp; G Trophy\nSurrey overcame their poor one-day form, with four losses in four National League games, to reach the quarter-finals in a close game at Bristol against Gloucestershire. Surrey won the toss and fielded first, restricting Gloucestershire to 230 for 8 after most of the Surrey bowlers got wickets. Chris Taylor made 74 and top-scored, but it was the all-rounder Alex Gidman who managed to keep his head calm, scoring 58 not out while the tail crashed to single figure scores around him. In reply, Surrey struggled to 110 for 4, losing wickets at key moments, but Rikki Clarke (62 not out) stood tall towards the end, taking the winning runs off James Averis with three balls and three wickets remaining in the innings.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Middlesex (22 May).\nMatch abandoned – Gloucestershire (2pts), Middlesex (2pts)\nJust as at nearby Taunton in Somerset, where Somerset were playing Lancashire in the Championship, rain hit Bristol heavily, as Gloucestershire Gladiators were hoping to climb out of the bottom of the table. The visitors from Middlesex Crusaders were struggling, faltering to 95 for 5 after 21 overs with only Owais Shah hitting more than 20—he made a half-century. Then rain intervened, and Gloucestershire were set 87 in 13 overs—however, when seven overs of the chase was over and Gloucestershire had made 40 for 2, rain stopped play again and the game was called off completely.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Nottinghamshire (25–27 May).\nNottinghamshire (22pts) beat Gloucestershire (4.5pts) by an innings and 27 runs\nAt Bristol, the visiting captain Stephen Fleming from Nottinghamshire won the toss and chose to bat—a wise choice, as it turned out, as only Mark Hardinges took wickets, but he conceded many runs in the process, finishing with four for 115. Gloucestershire were toothless, conceding 28 runs off no-balls, while their No. 5 David Hussey was deprived of a century when the team collapsed around him, finishing on 98 not out. With a run rate of above four in their 469 all out, they were putting pressure on the hosts, who started sedately without losing wickets. However, a spell from Ryan Sidebottom resulted in three wickets falling with only one run being scored, and that gave Northamptonshire the edge in the game. Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 250, as Mark Ealham removed the tail with three for 26 off 16 overs (with ten maidens), and, being forced to follow on, Gloucestershire lost both openers before stumps to have scored three runs for two wickets.\nThe rot continued on day 3, as Ealham and Sidebottom took more wickets, and Gloucestershire crashed to 56 for 5. Despite a lower-order partnership worth 77 between James Pearson (68) and Sri Lankan international Upul Chandana (49) for the seventh wicket, Gloucestershire were still all out for 192—27 runs short of making Nottinghamshire bat again. To compound the misery, Gloucestershire lost half a point for a slow over rate, and the result seemed to cement them near the bottom of the Division 1 table, as they lost contact with Middlesex and Sussex to settle in eighth place.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Lancashire (30 May).\nLancashire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by six wickets\nLancashire Lightning were lethal with the ball at Bristol as they beat Gloucestershire Gladiators by six wickets in a low-scoring encounter. Dominic Cork was the most punishing bowler, taking four for 14 off nine overs (including five wides) as Gloucestershire whimpered to 86, as veteran wicketkeeper Mark Alleyne top-scored with 24 not out. Alleyne was one of two Gloucestershire batsmen to make it into double figures. Jon Lewis, who had earlier on in the day been called up to the England ODI squad to meet Bangladesh and Australia, took three for 40, but it was not enough to stop Lancashire from cruising to the target with nearly 25 overs to spare.\nJune.\nThe first game in June was a 3-day defeat away to Kent, and the 3-day defeat trend continued with an innings defeat at home to Warwickshire. Their losing form continued with two League defeats, to Essex and Northamptonshire.\nCounty Championship: Kent v Gloucestershire (1–3 June).\nKent (18pts) beat Gloucestershire (3pts) by 7 wickets&lt;br&gt;\nKent deducted 8pts because of the poor quality of the pitch\nKent may have some cause to regret playing this match in their outground at Maidstone even though they secured a comfortable victory against Gloucestershire, as they ended up being fined 8pts for the poor quality of the pitch. Gloucestershire could only manage 183 in their first innings, and only 98 in their second, while Irish wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien held nine catches. Kent's bowlers all contributed, as Simon Cook, Andrew Hall and Amjad Khan took five wickets each. Kent made 204 in their first innings despite Mark Hardinges 5 for 51, and lost only 3 wickets in reaching their second-innings target of 78. No batsman made 40 in the entire match, and despite some overs on the first day being lost to rain, the game was over in 3 days. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Warwickshire (10–13 June).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by an innings and 2 runs\nA massive batting effort from Warwickshire compounded with a remarkable second-innings bowling spell from Heath Streak and a spineless Gloucestershire effort in general, saw Warwickshire move to the top of the Division One table. It started all right enough for the hosts at Bristol, as a marathon three-hour fifty from James Pearson and 23 extras sent them to 254 on the first day. However, a partnership of 151 between Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott lifted Warwickshire into the ascendancy, as no Gloucestershire bowler found the required bite, and everyone of the top ten except Michael Powell went into double figures as Warwickshire amassed 473 in nearly 150 overs. Then, Streak stole the show. As Streak grabbed four wickets in the first hour, Gloucestershire were quickly 20 for 5, and despite a rescuing effort from Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher, Gloucestershire were all out for 217 – two runs short of making Warwickshire bat again.\nNational League: Essex v Gloucestershire (17 June).\nEssex (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 55 runs\nAndy Flower smashed the Gloucestershire Gladiators' bowlers all around The County Ground in Chelmsford as he and Ronnie Irani paired up for 139 to send Essex Eagles to a final score of 271 for 7. Flower hit 127 not out off 93 balls, as Upul Chandana especially got to be punished, conceding 64 runs from 9 overs. In reply, Alex Tudor snared out a couple of early wickets, Gloucestershire lost wickets at regular intervals, and even a quick hit-out from Chandana – who scored 32 off 30 balls – was not enough to take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.\nNational League: Northamptonshire v Gloucestershire (19 June).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by five wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks were both forced to win this relegation clash, the last one-day game these sides would play before the Twenty20 Cup began. Winning the toss and batting, Gloucestershire crumbled from 53 for 0 to 55 for 4 in a collapse very reminiscent of what happened at their home ground on that same day in the England vs Australia game, but 63 from Mark Hardinges rescued them to a competitive total of 215 for 9. Bilal Shafayat and Tim Roberts looked to secure the victory, pairing up for 166 for the first wicket, but two wickets from Martyn Ball and two run-outs saw a collapse to 207 for 5. Shafayat, however, kept his cool, seeing the hosts to the target with ten balls to spare.\nTwenty20 Cup Group stage.\nGloucestershire stayed in Northampton for the Twenty20 game, and lost again. Two home wins followed, though, over Glamorgan and Worcestershire, and they looked very solid after their initial setback – after two no-results and yet another win over Worcestershire had ensured that they had grabbed eight points from six games. However, their bowling let them down in the last two games, first allowing whipping boys Glamorgan to take a thumping ten-wicket victory at Cardiff, and then handing Somerset the highest team score in Twenty20 Cup history, with 228 for 5 – which sent Somerset through and Gloucestershire out.\nNorthamptonshire v Gloucestershire (22 June).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 81 runs\nThe Gloucestershire Gladiators took a massive beating by the Northamptonshire Steelbacks in their match at Milton Keynes. Despite Gloucestershire's Martyn Ball taking two for 18 from four overs, positively economical, five no-balls and the fact that 16 overs had to be found from bowlers other than Ball allowed Northamptonshire to run away to 224 for 5 – a Twenty20 Cup record . David Sales top-scored for the hosts with 78 not out, while Australian Damien Wright paired up with him for 84 for the sixth wicket, scoring an unbeaten 38 of his own. Gloucestershire were in trouble from the start, as opening batsman Craig Spearman was run out for a duck, and when Wright ripped out two more wickets, the Gladiators were 10 for three. Four wickets from Ben Phillips resulted in a serious collapse, as Gloucestershire were all out for 143.\nGloucestershire v Glamorgan (24 June).\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by seven wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons were out of luck at Bristol, as their top order collapsed to the bowling of Carl Greenidge. Only a last-wicket partnership between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan batted out 20 overs, as they were 70 for 8 at one point but finished on 128 for 9. However, it was never enough. Croft took two wickets with his off-spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 built the platform as Gloucestershire Steelbacks eased to victory with 17 balls to spare.\nGloucestershire v Worcestershire (26 June).\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\nThis was a game of two batsmen. After Simon Kirby had ripped out two Worcestershire Royals wickets early on, to finish with figures of two for 15 from four overs, the Royals had been 24 for 3. Zander de Bruyn then hit eight fours and three sixes in his 76 not out, lifting the Royals to 162 for 6 and setting a potentially tricky target. However, William Weston replied with 73 not out of his own, and despite only Craig Spearman passing 20 of the other batsmen, Weston secured a win for Gloucestershire with two balls to spare.\nGloucestershire v Warwickshire (28 June).\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Warwickshire (1pt)\n37 balls were delivered before Gloucestershire Steelbacks and Warwickshire Bears were forced to abandon the game at The County Ground, Bristol due to rain. Warwickshire were 44 for 1 after 10 leg-byes and 16 not out from Nick Knight when the game was stopped. \nGloucestershire v Somerset (1 July).\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Somerset (1pt)\nOnly thirteen overs of play was possible at The County Ground, Bristol. By that time, two Somerset Sabres batsmen had departed for golden ducks – Graeme Smith and James Hildreth – and Somerset were 61 for 7. Gloucestershire Gladiators would have fancied their chances, but rain intervened to spoil the party.\n(Cricinfo scorecard\nWorcestershire v Gloucestershire (2 July).\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by nine wickets\nThe visitors Gloucestershire Gladiators recorded an easy victory at New Road as Worcestershire scored only 100 all out in their innings, Stephen Moore top-scoring with only 23. Martyn Ball took three for 24, but all the bowlers got wickets, and Mark Alleyne conceded only six runs in four overs. Although they lost Craig Spearman with the score on 22, the Gladiators knocked off their target easily, with nine wickets and five overs to spare.\nGlamorgan v Gloucestershire (5 July).\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by ten wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons broke their streak of four successive losses with a comfortable victory at Sophia Gardins. The two brothers David Harrison and Adam Harrison took two wickets each for Glamorgan, as Gloucestershire Gladiators crumbled to 57 for 7. Jon Lewis and Mark Alleyne shared a 68-run stand, but a quick burst of wickets from Robert Croft and Andrew Davies had them all out for 128 at Sophia Gardens. Croft and Matthew Elliott both made fifties as Glamorgan Dragons knocked off the runs with ten wickets and 7.3 overs to spare, helped by five no-balls and four wides from the Gloucestershire bowlers.\nSomerset v Gloucestershire (6 July).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 95 runs\nSomerset Sabres made it through to the quarter-finals after recording a massive score of 228 for 5 in twenty overs – the highest team total in Twenty20 Cup history, eclipsing a record set a couple of weeks earlier. The most economical bowler was Steve Kirby, and he conceded 35 runs in four overs, while the other four where all taken for more than 40 runs. Graeme Smith top-scored with 53, Ian Blackwell made 45, and James Hildreth recorded 32 off 10 balls – 28 from six shots to the boundary and four from the other four deliveries. Somerset's innings featured eight sixes and twenty extras. Gloucestershire Gladiators, who were second in the Midland/Wales/West group before this game at Taunton, had to go for expansive strokes, and were all out in sixteen overs, Gareth Andrew taking four for 22 while Craig Spearman top scored with 35 off 17 balls. Keith Parsons also contributed bowling-wise, taking three for 12.\nJuly.\nIndeed, conceding high scores were a part of Gloucestershire's game in July. In the County Championship, they let away 603 against Surrey, but saved the draw after trailing by 325 runs on first-innings. In the National League, Middlesex amassed 333 for 4 at Southgate – only to see that Gloucestershire scored even more, as they recorded only their second win in seven games, and that against second-placed Middlesex. A Bangladesh A side visited Bristol next, and Gloucestershire eventually won that friendly game by 130 runs despite being 72 for 7 in their first innings. However, they lost in the National League to Worcestershire, to go bottom of the Division 1 table. Gloucestershire were contented with a draw in their next match against Sussex in the Championship, never attempting the chase for 314 in 74 overs.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Surrey (8–11 July).\nGloucestershire (8pts) drew with Surrey (12pts)\nAt tea on day 2, it seemed inconceivable that, barring rain, this game would go to a draw, but Surrey failed to turn the screw and were denied victory by Alex Gidman and Steve Adshead. Surrey won the toss and opted to bat, and after Scott Newman and Richard Clinton had added 136 for the first wicket, things looked promising for the visitors to Bristol. With seven fifties – numbers 7, 8 and 9 Azhar Mahmood, Martin Bicknell and Harbhajan Singh all adding more than 75 runs – but no century, Surrey amassed 603 before being bowled out at lunch, none of the four bowlers conceding less than 100 runs. This was also the highest total without a century in England, breaking a 106-year-old record by Nottinghamshire, and the second highest total without a century in first-class cricket.\nThen, a burst of three wickets from Rikki Clarke sent Gloucestershire to the ropes at 83 for 5. Alex Gidman, Mark Hardinges and Ian Fisher lifted the first-innings total to 288, still trailing by 325, but Gidman and wicket-keeper Adshead had more tricks saved for the second innings. Gloucestershire batted a marathon 157.2 overs against the Surrey spin-bowling – Harbhajan bowling 49 of those – Gidman made a six-hour 142, Adshead pairing up with him for a little over four of those hours to add 93, and the second-innings total read 494. Surrey were eventually set a target of 180 to win in eleven overs. and not even Twenty20 style hitting from Azhar Mahmood, who hit three fours and one six in his 26 could send them to that, as they finished with 84 for 3.\nNational League: Middlesex v Gloucestershire (17 July).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by four wickets\nMiddlesex Crusaders amassed 333 for 4 in 45 overs – that's nearly seven and a half runs an over, well over the average five in 45-over games – and still lost to Gloucestershire Gladiators. It didn't look as the score would be as big at first, as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 to up the run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.\nTour Match: Gloucestershire v Bangladesh A (20–22 July).\nGloucestershire won by 130 runs\nBangladesh A, still without a win on tour of England, shocked Gloucestershire initially at Bristol. Shahadat Hossain took three wickets for the tourists, and Syed Rasel and Talha Jubair also chipped in, as Gloucestershire imploded to 72 for 7. However, 83 from wicketkeeper Stephen Snell lifted them to 232, before Jon Lewis and James Averis dug into the tourists to reduce them to 29 for 3. However, Tushar Imran played his way to his fourth first-class century, a career-best 119, to give the tourists a slender lead of 19 after a 122-run fourth-wicket stand between Tushar and Alok Kapali. However, Gloucestershire were determined to prove their class the second time around, and after losing Kadeer Ali for 1 after half an hour they were in control, batting their way to 330 for 5 in just 65.1 overs before declaring as Alex Gidman recorded a 94-ball century. Sri Lankan overseas player Malinga Bandara then took five for 45 with his leg-spin as the tourists imploded from 106 for 2 to 181 all out.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Worcestershire (24 July).\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 20 runs (D/L method)\nDespite being strengthened by their new acquisition from the West Indies, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Gloucestershire Gladiators still went down at Bristol. Having been put in to bat by Worcestershire Royals after rain delayed the start, Kabir Ali dug out a wicket with his first ball, and despite 51 from Matt Windows Gloucestershire still only posted 168 for 9. In reply, Vikram Solanki and Stephen Moore batted 12.4 overs without loss before rain intervened, and Worcestershire were then 20 runs ahead of their Duckworth/Lewis target.\nCounty Championship: Sussex v Gloucestershire (26–29 July).\nSussex (7pts) drew with Gloucestershire (7pts)\nRain damaged both the first and the second day at The County Ground, Hove, and only 93 overs were possible in two days. Yet, 18 wickets fell on those two days, 14 of which on the second day. Sussex resumed play on the second day with an overnight score of 97 for 4, and immediately lost two wickets to swing bowler Jon Lewis, who ended with four for 62. However, a quick blast of four fours, one six and one single from Jason Lewry lifted Sussex to 191 all out. The Gloucestershire reply never got off the mark, as seven batsmen were out in single figures and the highest partnership was 33. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan got good output with the ball, however, taking four for 26 as Gloucestershire ended on 142.\nDespite early breakthroughs from Lewis and Steve Kirby Sussex fought back, as Michael Yardy, Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams all passed 40 to see Sussex to 200 for 4 at stumps on day three. Lewis took four wickets on the fourth morning to bowl Sussex out for 267, Yardy completing his century before he was caught off Ian Fisher, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 317 required off 74 overs. Gloucestershire never attempted the chase, however, and Sussex failed to get them out, despite 19 overs of spin from Mushtaq Ahmed which yielded three wickets for 25.\nAugust.\nHowever, that was followed up by another loss, by 178 runs to Hampshire. They quickly got themselves up again, however, as they recorded a five-wicket National League win over the same team on Sunday – before crumbling to 87 all out in the same competition on Tuesday, losing to Nottinghamshire.\nThe team played another match with Sussex in the Championship, this time at Cheltenham College, and were duly beaten by 226 runs, and relegation from Division One was now almost a certainty. However, the Sunday brought a pleasant surprise, as they thumped Essex by 60 runs to move out of the relegation zone. A Championship draw with Surrey came in the third week of August, before a win over Lancashire sent them out of the relegation zone in the National League, but a loss to Glamorgan the following day immediately set them back. The month ended with Gloucestershire becoming the first team to lose to Glamorgan in 2005.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Hampshire (3–6 August).\nHampshire (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (7pts) by 178 runs\nGloucestershire bowlers Steve Kirby, Jon Lewis and Malinga Bandara threatened to make a mockery of Shaun Udal's decision to have a bat at Bristol, as Hampshire fell to 81 for 7, with five batsmen out for single-figures. However, a 257-run partnership – a Hampshire record for the eighth wicket – between Nic Pothas and Andy Bichel turned the match around, as Lewis was carted for 112 runs in his 20 overs, despite five of them being maiden overs. Hampshire finished their innings on 385 all out, after Pothas had made 139 and Bichel 138, and Gloucestershire struggled initially with the bat, losing their first two wickets for 25 runs (admittedly with Kirby filling the role of nightwatchman).\nOn the second day, Alex Gidman posted 115 and Steve Adshead 73 to lift Gloucestershire from 191 for 6 to 363. Hampshire then collapsed again, falling to 23 for 3 (including the wicket of nightwatchman Chris Tremlett) before John Crawley and Shane Watson rescued them with a 120-run partnership, as spinners Bandara and Ian Fisher toiled away to little effect. Hampshire eventually declared on 388 for 7, with four of their batsmen passing fifty, which left Gloucestershire 411 to win in a day. That never looked likely, but attritional cricket from Ramnaresh Sarwan and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 156 for 2, and then Gidman came in to add a further 39 for the fourth wicket. However, Shane Watson got a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Gidman, Shaun Udal unleashed a spell of furious off-spin on the tail, taking six for 61, and Gloucestershire were bowled out with an hour to spare.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Hampshire (7 August).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by five wickets\nMark Hardinges took four for 40 to help Gloucestershire Gladiators record a thumping victory over Hampshire Hawks, after tying down and frustrating the opponents' batsmen. Hardinges was the main culprit as Hampshire lost their last nine wickets for exactly 100 runs to post a total of 178, despite Nic Pothas, Sean Ervine and Shane Watson all making at least 40. In reply, William Weston and Matt Windows paired up for 106 runs for the second wicket, and not even Chris Tremlett, who took three for 34, could stop Gloucestershire from reaching the target with more than ten overs to spare.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Nottinghamshire (9 August).\nNottinghamshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by eight wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators were gracious hosts at Cheltenham College, as they allowed themselves to be beaten by eight wickets and bowled out for 87 by Nottinghamshire Outlaws. Despite the low scores, it took a whole 35.1 overs to get them out, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Mark Alleyne gluing to the crease for scores of 15 off 46 balls and 11 off 28 balls respectively. All the bowlers got wickets, with the exception of spinner Samit Patel, who nevertheless got fine figures of 5–2–7–0. Pakistani batsman and part-time leg-spinner Younis Khan, with only ten List A wickets to his name, got three for 5 – including Sarwan and Alleyne – to wrap up Gloucestershire's resistance. In reply, Anurag Singh hit an unbeaten 30 and Younis Khan 28 not out as Nottinghamshire eased to the target in half the time allotted.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Sussex (10–13 August).\nSussex (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by 226 runs\nSussex recorded a comfortable win at Bristol against Gloucestershire, to escape further from the relegation zone – in a match completely dominated by Sussex' overseas bowlers. Murray Goodwin, Chris Adams and Matt Prior all made quick half-centuries, to propel Sussex to 365, while the Gloucestershire spinners shared seven wickets – Malinga Bandara taking four for 64 and Ian Fisher three for 93. Indeed, spinners were to take the brunt of the bowling, as Gloucestershire had only gone in with two specialist seamers – and one of them, Steve Kirby, broke down with an injury in his fifth over of the day.\nGloucestershire resumed the second day on 28 for 1, and players from the Indian subcontinent were to dominate the day's proceedings, as they took all of the thirteen wickets. Sussex' Pakistani spinner Mushtaq Ahmed took six for 65, while Rana Naved-ul-Hasan added three to his overnight tally of one to end with four for 53. No Gloucestershire batsman passed 50, as they trailed by 141 on first innings. Sussex took on seven overs from the seamers, before Michael Ball and Bandara started another marathon spell. The openers survived to pair up for 67, but then Bandara took a burst of wickets, finishing the day with four for 58 as Sussex closed the second day's play on 128 for 4.\nOn the third day, Prior and Michael Yardy made a fifth wicket-partnership worth 141 runs, and Sussex could declare with a lead of 405 runs, after Bandara was taken for runs to end with the expensive innings bowling analysis of 26–3–112–4. Again, Gloucestershire subsided to the Pakistani bowlers, but for once an English-born bowler got his name up on Gloucestershire's scorecard – Alex Gidman was lbw to James Kirtley for 7. Rana took five and Mushtaq three as Gloucestershire collapsed to 179, Ramnaresh Sarwan making 117 of those.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Essex (14 August).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Essex (0pts) by 60 runs\nEssex Eagles imploded to 122 all out in chase of a small target to bring a tiny measure of excitement into the National League title race, while Gloucestershire Gladiators recorded a rare victory to take them out of the relegation zone. Batting first, Gloucestershire were bowled out for 182 in only 44.1 overs, Matt Windows top-scoring with 57 while Darren Gough and Grant Flower took three wickets each. Malinga Bandara and Martyn Ball shared the highest partnership of the match, adding 59 runs for the ninth wicket to carry Gloucestershire from 118 for 8. Essex then crawled to 49 for 7, James Averis finishing with amazing figures of 8–2–9–2, while Ball and Mark Alleyne also grabbed two wickets each. Despite 46 from New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams, Essex were all out for 122 when Adams was caught off the bowling of Mark Hardinges.\nCounty Championship: Surrey v Gloucestershire (16–19 August).\nSurrey (12pts) drew with Gloucestershire (11pts)\nSurrey's bowlers Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram shared out the first three wickets for only one solitary run, as Gloucestershire looked to collapse in the first innings at The Oval. Alex Gidman fought back, however, making 84 from number six, while Steve Adshead shepherded the tail with 148 not out, and Gloucestershire made their way to 350. Surrey and Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq ended with one for 110 in his first first class game of the season. Surrey initially struggled with the bat, as opener Mark Butcher only made six before he was dismissed by William Rudge.\nHowever, Gloucestershire's bowlers failed to get consistent bite, and Mark Ramprakash smashed his way past 1,000 first class runs in the season with a season-best 192. He was well supported by Graham Thorpe, Jonathan Batty, Ali Brown and Tim Murtagh, who all made scores above 30, and Surrey finished their first innings with a total of 463 in the middle of the first session on day three, with wickets shared out among the Gloucestershire bowlers. Surrey got an early breakthrough by dismissing Craig Spearman, but Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan stuck to the crease, adding 151 for the second wicket. However, three wickets from Nayan Doshi late on day three seemed to turn the game Surrey's way, with Gloucestershire leading by 181 runs for the loss of six wickets at stumps. However, the fourth day's play was rained off, and the match ended in a draw.\nNational League: Lancashire v Gloucestershire (22 August).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by six wickets\nThree centuries were recorded at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched a victory over the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, but pretty much everything went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, and went on to make 129 before being bowled by James Averis – who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century – which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process lifting his List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Gloucestershire (23 August).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by four wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators crashed back into the relegation zone with a defeat against Glamorgan Dragons at Sophia Gardens, succumbing to medium pace bowler David Harrison, who bowled four maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 9–4–16–2. Despite half-centuries from Kabir Ali and Alex Gidman, who looked to give the visitors a comfortable target after moving to 103 for 3, Dean Cosker ripped out three quick wickets, and Gidman was forced to consolidate. He did top score with 62, but Glamorgan were set a rather modest target of 195 to win. Jon Lewis made inroads with his medium pace early on, taking three wickets as Glamorgan stuttered to 40 for 4, but Michael Powell and Dan Cherry put Glamorgan back in it with a 79-run stand, and Gloucestershire's bowlers were made to rue their 15 wides, as they helped Glamorgan to reach their target with two overs remaining.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Glamorgan (25–28 August).\nGlamorgan (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (3pts) by 322 runs\nGlamorgan recorded their first Championship win in thirteen attempts this season at Bristol against fellow relegation candidates Gloucestershire. David Cherry made his second century of the season with changing partners, as he carried his bat to 152 not out at stumps – the total on 350 for 8. Cherry was last out, for 166, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 382 – to pass 350 for only the third time so far this season. Then, David Harrison and Alex Wharf embarked on a 19th-century-like bowling effort – in that they did almost all of the bowling. The seam pairing bowled 33 of the 34 overs, sharing all ten wickets. Gloucestershire crashed to 66 for 8 before Steve Adshead and Jon Lewis added 67 for the ninth wicket, but Whatf had Adshead caught and bowled before bowling William Rudge with the next ball. Robert Croft did not opt to bat again, however, preferring to set a big target for Gloucestershire to chase.\nHowever, Gloucestershire bowled with more effect the second time around, Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a marathon 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket with his first ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven as they made their way to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win – which would have been a first class record chase. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.\nSeptember.\nSeptember began with a draw with Middlesex, and then four successive losses: a National League loss to Worcestershire Royals and Championship and League losses to Nottinghamshire before a 12-day break. Then came a los to Warwickshire in the Championship, and though they beat Leicestershire Foxes in the final match, they could not escape relegation on net run rate.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Middlesex (30 August – 2 September).\nGloucestershire (10pts) drew with Middlesex (9pts)\nGloucestershire recovered well from last week's defeat at the hands of Glamorgan, to give Middlesex a decent fight and take the most points from a drawn game at Bristol. The hosts batted first, and after losing Craig Spearman and Ramnaresh Sarwan early, Gloucestershire fought back with three partnerships worth more than 60. Alex Gidman, Steve Adshead and Malinga Bandara all recorded fifties; the Sri Lankan Bandara, batting at eight, took the liberty to hit two sixes in an 89-ball 70. For Middlesex, Alan Richardson and Jamie Dalrymple took four wickets each, but gave up more than four runs an over in the process as Glamorgan made 333 in 92.2 overs. Middlesex batted to stumps on day one without loss, but William Rudge removed the top three to set them back slightly. Wickets continued to fall, with Malinga Bandara taking four of them, and Middlesex crashed to 248 for 9 before a last wicket partnership between Melvyn Betts and Stuart Clark took them to 297 before Bandara dismissed Betts lbw to end with five for 71.\nBetts and Clark then shared five of the ten Gloucestershire wickets to fall, interrupting Gloucestershire's innings rather regularly, but not preventing four partnerships of above 50. Kadeer Ali top-scored with 61, while Mark Hardinges was stranded on 58 to lift the hosts to a total 287, which set Middlesex 324 in five hours to win. Gloucestershire got a breakthrough in the very first over, as Ed Smith hit two fours off Jon Lewis before being caught behind after four deliveries. With Owais Shah dismissed by Bandara, Middlesex went into defensive mode, and eventually the match was declared a draw with Middlesex 121 short of the winning target.\nNational League: Worcestershire v Gloucestershire (4 September).\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by eight wickets\nA menacing spell from Shoaib Akhtar, who got six wickets for 16 runs, including the first five as Gloucestershire crashed to 22 for 5, left Gloucestershire Gladiators without any hope in the bottom-fight at New Road, Worcester. Akhtar's bowling analysis was the best in the National League all season. After Akhtar was taken off, Malinga Bandara and Mark Alleyne set about trying to bat out fifty overs, but Alleyne was caught by Worcestershire Royals' Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali cleaned up the tail with two wickets as Gloucestershire were all out for 105. Bandara then got the wickets of Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki with successive deliveries, but Chris Gayle guided the hosts home with an unbeaten 53 off 70 balls, as Worcestershire won with more than 20 overs to spare.\nCounty Championship: Nottinghamshire v Gloucestershire (5–6 September).\nNottinghamshire (20pts) beat Gloucestershire (1.5pts) by an innings and 64 runs\nTen wickets fell on the first day at Trent Bridge, and twenty on the second, as Nottinghamshire recorded a victory to extend their hold on Division One of the County Championship. Batting first, they lost openers Jason Gallian and Darren Bicknell early on to be 16 for 2, and after a 27-run third-wicket stand Steve Kirby trapped Younis Khan lbw for 12. However, Russell Warren and David Hussey rebuilt, and Hussey went on to smash a four-and-a-half-hour 157, his third Championship century of the season, as Nottinghamshire made a total of 336. The first day's play ended when the last Nottinghamshire wicket fell, after 82.4 overs, and Gloucestershire were then penalised 1.5 points for their slow over rate.\nGloucestershire's batting, however, gave below-average scores. Their first innings lasted for 35 overs, Mark Ealham taking five for 31 as the visitors were asked to follow on. Kadeer Ali carried his bat and made 55 not out in their all out total of 103. Batting again, they crashed to 98 for 8, Ealham again taking four wickets, before Jon Lewis cut loose. Gloucestershire required 135 runs to make Nottinghamshire bat again, and Lewis decided that the best way of making that was to smash the ball about. He hit eight fours and three sixes for a 27-ball 55, before the cameo was ended by Hussey holding a catch off his bat. The quickfire innings lifted Gloucestershire to 169 – still 64 short of making Nottinghamshire bat again.\nNational League: Nottinghamshire v Gloucestershire (9 September).\nNottinghamshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by one wicket\nThe relegation battle in the National League tightened further, as the match at Trent Bridge became a low-scoring thriller, where Gloucestershire Gladiators failed to put away two good positions – first they collapsed from 75 for 2 to make 116, then they allowed Nottinghamshire to hit 19 for the last wicket. They were put in to bat by Nottinghamshire Outlaws and after losing Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan for ducks, Steve Adshead and Craig Spearman rebuilt with a 60-run third-wicket stand. Mark Ealham and Gareth Clough shared the last seven wickets, however, after Ryan Sidebottom had bowled Spearman for 18, and Gloucestershire were all out for 116. James Averis then took four wickets for the Gladiators, as Nottinghamshire lost their first five wickets for 32 runs, but Anurag Singh and Mark Ealham put them back on track by adding 30 for the sixth wicket. Jon Lewis broke through their defences, however, shattering Ealham's stumps as he was bowled, and when Anurag Singh departed for 41, Nottinghamshire's task looked steep. They needed 19 for the last wicket with Ryan Sidebottom and Greg Smith batting – but Smith hit two fours as he ended with 16 not out to take Nottinghamshire to the victory.\nCounty Championship: Warwickshire v Gloucestershire (21–24 September).\nWarwickshire (18pts) beat Gloucestershire (3pts) by 181 runs\nWarwickshire came back from 18 for 3 and then 90 for 5 to win their last Championship game of the season. A two-hour partnership yielding 70 runs between Jamie Troughton and Trevor Frost took Warwickshire past 150, before Sri Lankan Malinga Bandara removed four of the last five wickets, and Warwickshire ended on 208 all out. However, early wickets taken by Neil Carter and Dougie Brown sent Gloucestershire to 29 for 3 at the close of play on day one. Warwickshire continued to chip away on the second day, as five bowlers shared the remaining seven wickets, and Gloucestershire were bowled out for 118. South African-born first class debutant Grant Hodnett was the only one to pass 20 for Gloucestershire, taking three hours before falling one short of a half-century on debut. Ian Westwood did manage a fifty, hitting 55 in a 94-run stand with Nick Knight, and Warwickshire closed on 197 for 3. Despite four wickets from Malinga Bandara, Warwickshire managed 320 for 9 before declaring.\nGloucestershire attempted to chase a total of 411 to win, but after an opening stand of 80 Naqqash Tahir removed both openers in quick succession, and Gloucestershire closed on 97 for 2. Off spinner Alex Loudon then celebrated his call-up to the England team to tour Pakistan the following winter by taking six for 66 as Gloucestershire were bowled out for 229.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Glamorgan (25 September).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by three wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators made it past Glamorgan Dragons to take a victory in their final game of the season, but they were still relegated into Division Two, thus suffering relegation in both forms of cricket. Winning the toss and bowling first, Gloucestershire's spinners Malinga Bandara and Mark Hardinges shared four for 87 in their 18 overs after the opening bowlers Jon Lewis and James Averis went wicketless. Gloucestershire did concede 32 extras, however, as Glamorgan assembled 262 for 8. Steve Adshead and Kadeer Ali added 86 for Gloucestershire's first wicket, before Craig Spearman took on the Gloucestershire bowlers to hit 80 off 71 balls. Despite his dismissal to send the score to 228 for 6, Bandara, Lewis and Mark Alleyne added the required runs, as Gloucestershire won with 14 balls to spare."

        "title": "Irish Real Tennis Association",
        "text": "The Irish Real Tennis Association (Cumann Leadóige na h-Éireann) encourages the preservation and development of the game and facilities of real tennis in the Republic of Ireland.\nBackground.\nTennis is first recorded in Ireland in 1609 with a court in Thomas Street, Dublin. Today there are no courts in Northern Ireland and two courts in the Republic of Ireland, neither in playable condition. One is a peculiar open-air court on Lambay Island, part of an Edwin Lutyens-designed estate for the Baring family. It is private property, in a fairly inaccessible location, and the lack of a roof is a practical problem given Ireland's climate.\nThe other court was built by Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh in 1885 at his Earlsfort Terrace house (), located a few minutes' walk from St. Stephen's Green, Dublin. Constructed of a brick exterior with a black marble interior, the court saw Tom Pettitt successfully defend his world championship against challenger Charles Saunders in 1890. Pettitt resigned the title later that year. In 1939, Rupert Edward Cecil Lee Guinness, 2nd Earl of Iveagh presented his famed court to the nation as a gift. Despite his written wishes (not legally part of the bequest) that the court remain in use, it was immediately shut down, and internal playing features dismantled. The court has since been used by University College Dublin, first as a gymnasium and more recently as a laboratory and offices.\nSaving the Dublin court.\nSince the late 1980s Michael Bolton and Ted Neville had monitored the Earlsfort Terrace court, and lobbied for its restoration when eventually vacated by the university. Additionally, Edward Hughes, former president of the United States Court Tennis Association took an interest in the future of the structure. In 1998, after a plan was announced to permanently convert the court into a 320-seat music recital hall, these men joined their efforts and formed the Irish Real Tennis Association (IRTA). After recruiting members and finding support from the Dublin International Sports Council, \"An Taisce\", and the Irish Georgian Society, the IRTA issued legal and public relations challenges to the proposed conversion. The challenges ranged from the local planning level to a High Court appeal. The IRTA lost every battle, but ended up winning the war, at least so far, as the government abandoned its planned project.\nAs of November 2007, the university has vacated the building, and the Office of Public Works is entering into discussions with the IRTA about restoring the court for an active real tennis venue.\nFuture goals.\nThe IRTA is hopeful that the government will allow them to restore the Dublin court. This would transition the association from a preservation focus, to an active public sporting club. Its mission would be twofold: management of the tennis court; and functioning as the national governing body for real tennis.\nThe association has already made some steps in this direction. Beginning in 2003 they have annually held both an Irish National tournament and an Irish Open tournament, at real tennis clubs in England. The IRTA is also working to demonstrate to the government that they have the financial and membership support to undertake the estimated €750,000 historic restoration project. Individual membership is €15 (€30 family) and open to all interested in promoting real tennis in Ireland.\nTournaments.\n2003, handicapped matches held at the Bristol and Bath Tennis Club, May 31 - June 1:\n2004, handicapped matches held at the Bristol and Bath Tennis Club, May 1 - May 2:\n2005, handicapped matches held at the Royal County of Berkshire Real Tennis Club (Holyport), May 28 - May 29:\n2006, handicapped matches held at the Royal County of Berkshire Real Tennis Club, May 27 - May 28:\n2007, held at the Bristol and Bath Tennis Club, May 26 - May 27:\n2008, handicapped matches held at the Cambridge University Real Tennis Club and Newmarket &amp; Suffolk Real Tennis Club, May 31 - June 1\n2009, handicapped matches held at the Middlesex University Real Tennis Club, May 30 - May 31"

        "text": "Jody Richard Davis (born November 12, 1956) is an American former professional baseball player and minor league manager. He was a catcher in Major League Baseball with the Chicago Cubs and Atlanta Braves from to . A two-time National League All-Star, Davis won the 1986 National League Gold Glove Award.\nMajor League career.\nDavis was selected by the New York Mets in the third round of the 1976 Major League Baseball Draft. In , the Mets traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals and in he was drafted from the Cardinals by the Chicago Cubs in the Rule 5 draft.\nDavis made his major league debut on 21 April 1981 at the age of 24, and became the Cubs starting catcher as a rookie. In the earlier years of his career, Davis showed promise on offense and became a fan favorite among Cubs fans. In his second full season, 1983, he set what would turn out to be career highs with 151 games played, a batting average of .271 and 24 home runs. Davis also had 84 RBI in the same season. In 1984, he set a career high with 94 RBI and earned his first All-Star selection, as the Cubs won the National League Eastern Division title, their first title of any kind since . In the only post-season appearance of his career, Davis hit .389 with 2 doubles, 2 home runs, 6 RBI and an .833 slugging percentage in the 1984 National League Championship Series as the Cubs were defeated by the San Diego Padres in a five-game series.\nDavis possessed a strong throwing arm and finished second among National League catchers in caught stealing percentage in 1981. In 1982, he finished second among National League catchers, behind Gold Glove winner Gary Carter, in Total Zone Runs, and he finished eighth among all National League players in Defensive Wins Above Replacement (Defensive WAR). However, Davis slumped defensively in 1983, leading the league in passed balls with 21 and finishing second in errors with 13. In 1984, with the help of bullpen coach and former catcher Johnny Oates, Davis began to regain his form as a defensive asset. In 1985, his 1.6 Defensive WAR once again placed him among the top 10 defensive players in the league. In 1986, Davis turned in a stellar defensive campaign. He led National League catchers in putouts, assists, and baserunners caught stealing, and he finished second to Bob Brenly in fielding percentage. His 21 Total Zone Runs and 3.3 Defensive WAR led not only National League catchers but indeed all National League players. When Davis broke the 100 assists barrier in , he joined Johnny Bench, Jim Sundberg, Gary Carter and Tony Peña as the only catchers to have more than 100 assists in a season since the end of the Second World War. His defensive excellence helped earn him his second All-Star Game appearance and garnered the Gold Glove Award.\nAround the same time, his offense started slipping. In 1986, Davis hit 21 home runs but struck out 110 times. His batting average slipped to .229 in 1988 and, he was replaced by rookie catcher Damon Berryhill, before being traded with three games left of the season to his hometown Atlanta Braves. Davis played only two games with the Braves that year, but he stayed in Atlanta for one full season and one partial season. With the Braves, he was also seeing occasional action as a first baseman. In 1989, Davis batted .169 with Atlanta in 78 games. In 1990, he played in 12 games, going 2-for-28 for a batting average of .071. Davis was granted a release by the Braves, after which time he signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers organization (AAA Toledo Mud Hens). He played only 3 games for the Mud Hens before deciding to retire at the age of 33.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a ten-year Major League Baseball career, Davis played in 1,082 games, accumulating 877 hits in 3,585 at bats for a .245 career batting average along with 127 home runs and 490 runs batted in. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage as a catcher. On 15 April 1987, Davis hit the 4,000th home run in the history of Wrigley Field.\nJody holds the all-time MLB record for number of baserunners caught stealing at 89, set in 1986.\nManaging career.\nDavis managed the Calgary Outlaws of the Canadian Baseball League to a 24–13 record during the league's only season (2003). Since the league suspended operations at its All-Star break, the Outlaws were awarded the Jenkins Cup. Following his time in Canada, Davis was a minor league manager and roving catching instructor in the Chicago Cubs system, serving as manager of the Peoria Chiefs in 2006, Daytona Cubs of the Florida State League in and when his team won the Florida State League championship. He also managed the Boise Hawks in the Cubs system in 2010.\nDuring the following off-season, he managed in the Venezuelan Winter League where he was named Manager of the Year.\nIn 2017 and 2018 he managed the Pensacola Blue Wahoos (AA) and in 2019 he managed the Louisville Bats (AAA), both in the Cincinnati Reds organization.\nHe was the hitting instructor in the San Diego Padres organization in 2015 and 2016.\nPersonal life.\nDavis has been married twice and has three children from his first marriage: Joshua, Ashley, and Jeremy. He is the second-cousin of former Major League Baseball player Wade Davis. He graduated from North Hall High School and attended Middle Georgia College before being drafted.He was included in the inaugural class of the North Hall High School Athletics Hall of Fame, created in 2023. The baseball field at the school has also been named after him. \nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Montpellier Hérault Rugby (MHR) (; ) is a French professional rugby union club, based in Montpellier, Occitanie and named after the Hérault river. The club competes in the top level of the French league system, the Top 14. They originally played at Stade Sabathé (capacity 5,000) but moved to the Stade Yves-du-Manoir, later known as Altrad Stadium, and since renamed the GGL Stadium, in 2007. They wear white and blue.\nHistory.\nThe club was established in 1986 through the merger of two other rugby union clubs, the Stade Montpelliérain and MUC Rugby.\nIn 1993 the club won the Challenge de l'Espérance.\nIn 2003 the club became the champion of France's second division national rugby league, the Pro D2. After finishing second in the league table at the end of the 2002–03 season, Montpellier advanced to the playoffs. They defeated Auch in the semi-finals and Tarbes in the finals to win promotion to the Top 14. The following season the club played for the European Shield, and contested the final. Played in May 2004, Montpellier defeated Italian club Viadana 25 points to 19 to win the Shield.\nThe club barely avoided relegation after the 2006–07 season. Winning only nine games during a twenty-six-game season, Montpellier found itself in a relegation position with only two games left to play. Thanks to a bonus-point victory in week 25, the team finished just four points ahead of Agen which was relegated to the Pro D2 at the end of the year.\nAfter 2006–07, the club's fortunes began to improve. In June 2007, Fulgence Ouedraogo became the first Montpellier player to play on the French national rugby union team. That same summer the club's new stadium, the Stade Yves-du-Manoir (now GGL Stadium), opened. In 2007–08 Montpellier enjoyed its first winning season in the Top 14. The club made its next step up the table in 2010–11 when it unexpectedly finished sixth by a single point and made the Top 14 playoffs for the first time. The underdog squad defeated both Castres and Racing Métro to make the championship game where they were defeated 15–10 by Toulouse. Since that season, Montpellier has become a consistent playoff contender, finishing fifth in both 2011–12 and 2012–13 and second on the league table in 2013–14.\nThanks to the club's excellent 2010–11 showing, Montpellier was awarded its first spot in the Heineken Cup tournament for 2011–12. The club returned for the 2012–13 tournament and made the quarter-finals before being eliminated by Clermont. Montpellier returned for the final edition of the Heineken Cup in 2013–14, and are participating in the successor to the Heineken Cup, the European Rugby Champions Cup, in 2014–15.\nFrom 2011 the club has been chaired and funded by Mohed Altrad.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Montpellier squad for the 2023–24 season is: "

        "text": "Félix Mantilla Botella (; , ; born 23 September 1974) is a Spanish former professional tennis player and coach. In common with many of his fellow countrymen, Mantilla's best surface is clay. While not as successful away from the clay, Mantilla also produced good hardcourt results. Mantilla's best stroke was his single-handed backhand and he was known for his baseline consistency from both sides and high endurance levels. He reached the semi-finals of the 1998 French Open, won the 2003 Rome Masters, and achieved a career-high singles ranking of World No. 10.\nTennis career.\nMantilla began playing tennis at the age of ten and was a member of the winning Spanish Sunshine Cup team along with Albert Costa in 1992.\nMantilla turned professional in 1993 playing Futures and Challenger events.

He also played his first match on the ATP Tour in Prague, losing to compatriot Àlex Corretja in 3 sets.\nAt the beginning of 1994 Mantilla was ranked 301st in the ATP Entry Rankings, but at the end of 1995 he had progressed to 84th and had a 10–5 record for the season. Mantilla made his first two finals that year losing in the Budapest Challenger to Jiří Novák in 3 sets and following his first semi final appearance at the ATP level losing to Sjeng Schalken, it was followed up with his first final on the ATP Buenos Aires losing to Carlos Moyá in straight sets.\nMantilla's ranking had jumped up 66 places at the end of 1996 where he finished the year ranked 18th. He compiled a 48–27 record for the year mostly on the clay, and in the process won three Challenger titles, each of them without losing a set. This feat was achieved in Punta del Este defeating Kris Goosens in the final. Mantilla followed the success with victories in Naples over Karim Alami and later in the year in Tashkent over Lars Rehmann.\nOn the ATP main tour, Mantilla qualified for his first TMS event in Monte-Carlo and defeated the two time Roland Garros champion Sergi Bruguera before losing in the quarter-finals to Albert Costa.

After this he went on to win his first ATP title in Oporto over Hernán Gumy 6–7, 6–4, 6–3. Mantilla proceeded to make two more finals in Gstaad and Umag where he lost to Albert Costa on both occasions. In total for 1996 Mantilla won three Challenger titles and his first title in Oporto and made three finals.\nIn 1997 Mantilla went a career best of 53–22 for the season.

This year also had his best performance at the US Open reaching 4th round losing to Richard Krajicek, and in 3rd round won over John Van Lottum in 5 sets, playing last sets with big cramps that impeded normal movement. He closed the best year in his career with a victory on National Tennis Masters competition in Spain (national version of ATP World Tour Finals) defeating Francisco Clavet at the final in Zaragoza after losing the first set. After winning Clavet, Mantilla declared: \"Next year I want to win more important tournaments, shine in the big occasions and be a better tennis player\".\nIn 1998 Mantilla after losing a bet with Luis Lobo in Rome, in which he had to dye his hair blonde. Mantilla reached his highest ever ranking of number 10 on 8 June after reaching the semi-finals at Roland Garros. He beat Wolfgang Schranz, Byron Black, Fabrice Santoro and Ramón Delgado to reach the quarter-final. There he defeated Thomas Muster, gaining revenge for his loss in Rome against the same opponent who when Mantilla was eating a banana at the change of ends, had taken the banana out of his hands and started to eat it himself, at the end of the match Mantilla did not shake hands with Muster. He lost his semi final to Carlos Moyà. He defended his title in Bournemouth in clay, defeating Albert Costa. He also improves his achievements in hard courts and reached two finals: Dubai, losing to Àlex Corretja and Long Island losing to Patrick Rafter. He also reached the semifinals in Auckland.\nMantilla won his only title for 1999 in Barcelona over Karim Alami, destroying his rivals at the first three rounds and defeating excellent clay players from quarterfinals: Carlos Moya, Francisco Clavet and Karim Alami. He defeated world number 1 Pete Sampras at Indian Wells on hardcourt and managed to repeat the feat defeating the then number 1 Lleyton Hewitt in 2002 on hardcourt as well. Apart from his title he reached the semis of the TMS events in Monte Carlo and Rome losing to Gustavo Kuerten and to Pat Rafter respectively.

Mantilla said about his game \"I don't have the serve of Sampras or the volley of Rafter or the talent of Agassi, you know. I must be very focus every point. I must be strong mentally.\"\nAfter 2003 Mantilla's career went into decline, with the onset of injuries to his Achilles tendon and to his shoulder and the game moving at a speed that Mantilla's game could not keep up with.

        "title": "Ben Wilson (basketball)",
        "text": "Benjamin Wilson Jr. (March 18, 1967 – November 21, 1984) was an American high school basketball player from Chicago, Illinois. Wilson, a Neal F. Simeon Vocational High School basketball player, was regarded as the top high school player in the U.S. by scouts and coaches attending the 1984 Athletes For Better Education basketball camp. Wilson is noted as the first Chicago athlete to receive this honor. On November 21, 1984, Wilson died due to injuries he sustained in a shooting the day before.\nEarly life.\nBorn in 1967 to Ben Wilson Sr. and Mary Wilson (née Gunter), Wilson was raised in the Chatham neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. Mary Wilson had two sons from a previous marriage, including Curtis Glenn, and would have sons Anthony and Jeffrey with the elder Wilson before the couple divorced. Wilson began playing basketball in elementary school. He started at St. Dorothy School and transferred to Ruggles Elementary School, graduating in 1981. Wilson practiced at Cole Park in Chatham and participated in summer league games in Chicago. \nAs his game developed, friends and family surrounding Wilson began to notice that his talent could make him one of the best players in the sport. They made it a point to protect Wilson from trouble as he got older. As he was entering high school, the nationwide crack epidemic was in full swing and some of the people closest to Wilson, including his older brother Curtis, became addicted. Chicago's violent crime rate was very high during this time as well, especially on the South Side.\nHigh school career.\nIn the fall of 1981, Wilson began his freshman year at Simeon. During the 1982–83 season, he was the only sophomore on the varsity basketball team. For the 1983–84 season, Simeon advanced to the Illinois AA State Championship, which was held at Assembly Hall on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Behind Wilson, Simeon defeated West Aurora High School by nine points in the semifinals and beat top-ranked Evanston Township High School to win their first ever state title. \n\"ESPN HS\" regarded Wilson as the best junior in the country for the 1983–84 season. He played basketball with R. Kelly and Nick Anderson. Wilson was described as \"Magic Johnson with a jump shot\" by his Simeon coach, Bob Hambric.\nAthletes For Better Education (AFBE).\nIn July 1984, Wilson attended the invitation-only Athletes For Better Education camp in Princeton, New Jersey. The camp allowed scouts and coaches to watch top high school students in a single location. After the week-long event, Wilson was ranked the number-one high school player in America. As his senior season approached, it was believed that Wilson was considering scholarship offers from the University of Illinois, DePaul University and Indiana University.\nDeath.\nBackground.\nOn November 20, 1984, Wilson decided against lunching with teammates as he wanted to talk to his girlfriend, Jetun Rush, with whom he had been having significant issues. The couple had conceived a child early in 1984, a son named Brandon, and Rush would neither speak to Wilson nor let him see his child. Meanwhile, Calumet High School student Billy Moore was outside Simeon's campus with a .22 caliber revolver looking to avenge his cousin, who had been allegedly robbed of $10 by a Simeon student. \nAfter finding out the conflict had been resolved, Moore and his friend Omar Dixon decided to stay nearby. Eventually the two followed Moore's friend Erica Murphy to a nearby luncheonette located on South Vincennes Avenue, just up the street from Simeon.\nThe shooting.\nBilly Moore, in the ESPN documentary about Ben Wilson, described what happened next. He and Omar Dixon were outside the luncheonette when Wilson and Rush came up the street behind them. Rush was trying to break away from Wilson, who in his desperation to speak to her failed to pay attention to where he was going and bumped into Moore. Moore called to Wilson to watch where he was going, and Wilson responded by turning around and heading back toward Moore. The two engaged in a loud argument, with an infuriated Wilson and Moore exchanging expletives. \nDuring the argument, Moore drew the pistol he had been carrying. Wilson taunted him and dared him to shoot; Moore later said he felt that the much larger Wilson was just \"punking\" him. Wilson then lunged at Moore, who responded by firing two shots at him. The first struck Wilson in his groin while the second struck him in his abdomen and caused significant internal bleeding. Moore and Dixon then fled. Within minutes, word of the shooting reached Simeon's campus, and a crowd gathered near Wilson. Emergency services were called at 12:37 PM local time, while Simeon basketball coach Bob Hambric made a call to WMAQ-TV newsman Warner Saunders and informed him of what happened.\nParamedics were slow in reaching the scene and at approximately 1:20 PM, Hambric decided to take it upon himself to get his star player to the hospital. Just as he was getting into his car, an ambulance arrived to the scene on South Vincennes. According to Chicago's then emergency protocol, Wilson was taken to the nearest available hospital, which was St. Bernard Hospital in Englewood. St. Bernard was a small community hospital that was not equipped to handle emergencies or trauma cases like shootings, so a call was put out for any available trauma surgeon to report immediately to St. Bernard.\nAftermath.\nAt Simeon, the basketball team remained sequestered in the teachers' lounge for the rest of the day. Wilson's teammate Teri Sampson recalls that throughout the night, the reports progressively worsened, going from Wilson possibly recovering in time for the state playoffs, to perhaps missing a year of play, to possibly never playing again, to fighting for his life.\nWilson's brother Curtis Glenn recounted in the ESPN documentary seeing his brother being wheeled by him in the hospital and noticing his feet were unnaturally pale. Upon examination it was discovered that Wilson's aorta was damaged by the second shot and there was no blood reaching his lower extremities. Despite doctors repeatedly telling her they could save her son, Mary Wilson's professional experience as a nurse told her that even if they were able to repair the damage, Ben would likely be in a persistent vegetative state afterward due to the massive blood he had already lost. Early the next morning, Mary Wilson asked that her son be taken off of life support, and Ben Wilson died shortly thereafter. He was buried at Oak Woods Cemetery.\nSoon after the shooting, Erica Murphy returned to her home to find Billy Moore sitting in her living room watching television. It was through this that he discovered who he had shot. Moore remained there until the police began pounding on Murphy's door looking for him later that evening. Dixon's arrest followed, with the charges upgraded to murder once word of Wilson's death reached the police. Police presented both suspects with a case theory that after Moore's conflict with Wilson, Dixon tried to pick Wilson's pockets, and then urged Moore to shoot Wilson. Both young men signed confessions to that effect that were later recanted. Despite being underage at the time, the Cook County State’s Attorney's office elected to try both men as adults.\nAt their trial, the prosecutors presented the same case theory to the jury when the trial began the following year. Jetun Rush was the prosecution's lead witness and testified to the same effect. Moore and Dixon's attorneys chose to present Wilson's celebrity as the primary reason for the charges against the two teenagers. Both Moore and Dixon were convicted on charges of murder and attempted armed robbery. Per the recommendations of the prosecuting attorneys, they both were given significant prison sentences. Moore received a forty-year sentence while Dixon received a thirty-year sentence. Dixon was given the lesser sentence because even though he was involved in the crime, Moore had been the one to fire the fatal shots.\nThe Wilson family's lawsuit against the hospital for inappropriate delay of medical care was settled in 1992 for an undisclosed amount. Dixon was released on parole in 2000, and Moore in 2005. Dixon later began an unrelated sentence for armed robbery, although Moore, interviewed in the 2012 documentary \"Benji\", claims that his own confession was coerced, and that Dixon was not involved in Wilson's shooting. Wilson died on the same day that Simeon was to open its season. The team chose to play the game, a rematch with Evanston, and won.\nPersonal life.\nHe had one son, Brandon Wilson (b. September 1984), with his high school girlfriend Jetun Rush. Brandon, who was 10 weeks old when his father died, went on to play basketball at the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore, wearing Wilson's number 25. He played professionally with the Long Island Wizards. Brandon went on to coach basketball. He attended and graduated from the Nassau Police Academy. He served in the Port Washington Police Department for 5 years. \nOn January 13, 2022, Brandon Sherrod Wilson died in a car accident. Brandon died after he swerved into a shoulder on the Northern State Parkway, and hit a pole and two trees.\nLegacy.\nWilson's friend and Simeon teammate, former NBA and University of Illinois basketball player Nick Anderson, wore jersey number 25 during his career in Wilson's honor. Juwan Howard wore 25 at the University of Michigan as a tribute to Wilson. Former Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose, who graduated from Simeon in 2007, wore number 25, and the team won the state championship in 2006 and 2007. He also wore number 25 with the New York Knicks, after being traded. Simeon basketball player Jabari Parker had the number 25 stitched into the team sneakers during his time at Simeon. \nFollowing Nick Anderson's tribute to Wilson in wearing number 25 at Illinois, many others who graduated from Simeon and moved on to play for the Illini have carried on the tradition of wearing the jersey number 25. In the years since his murder in 1984, Deon Thomas, Bryant Notree, Calvin Brock, and Kendrick Nunn have all worn 25 during their basketball career at Illinois to honor Wilson. ESPN premiered a documentary on Wilson titled \"Benji\" on October 23, 2012."

        "text": "The FEI World Equestrian Games are the major international championships for equestrianism, and are administered by the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI). The games have been held every four years, halfway between sets of consecutive Summer Olympic Games, since 1990. Prior to that year, all ten of the FEI's individual disciplines held separate championships, usually in separate countries. The modern WEG runs over two weeks and, like the Olympics, the location rotates to different parts of the world. Riders and horses competing at WEG go through a rigorous selection process, and each participating country sends teams that have distinguished themselves through competition as the nation's best in each respective discipline. At the 2010 Games, 57 countries were represented by 800 people and their horses.\nThe WEG gradually expanded to include eight of the FEI's ten disciplines: combined driving, dressage, endurance riding, eventing, paraequestrianism, reining, show jumping, and vaulting. The FEI's two remaining regional disciplines, horseball and tent pegging, still conduct independent championships.\nThe 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky marked a series of firsts in WEG history: the first time WEG were held outside Europe; the first time that championships for eight FEI disciplines were held at one location (the Kentucky Horse Park); and the first time WEG had a title sponsor (in this case the animal health and nutrition group corporation Alltech, headquartered in the nearby city of Nicholasville). Permanent upgrades added to the Kentucky Horse Park leading up to the event included the completion of a 6,000 seat, climate-controlled indoor arena and completion of a 7,500 seat outdoor stadium.\nThe Tryon International Equestrian Center, near Mill Spring, North Carolina, was the location of the 2018 FEI World Equestrian Games.\nMedal count.\nThe current historical medal count (as of 2022) of the FEI World Equestrian Games is as follows:\nMedal count is sorted by total gold medals, then total silver medals, then total bronze medals, then alphabetically. The table doesn't count events before 1990."

        "title": "Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)",
        "text": "Robert Clyde Jones (born December 18, 1951) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Denver Nuggets in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the Philadelphia 76ers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"the Secretary of Defense\", Jones won an NBA championship with the 76ers in 1983, was a four-time NBA All-Star, an eight-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team, and was the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 1983.\nBiography.\nBobby Jones was one of the most admired defenders ever to wear an NBA uniform. While most other players depended on the occasional thrown elbow, hip-check, or grab of the uniform to gain an advantage, Jones relied on hustle and determination. It was Jones’ stellar defense along with his other specialties such as leadership, that made him a standout sixth man. Opposing teams could ill afford to relax on defense when Jones came off the bench, and they also had to work a lot harder on offense to get the ball in or even near the basket.\nJones's coaches would marvel that he was so good at things they had trouble getting many other players to do at all, such as blocking shots, moving without the ball, hustling back on defense, tipping passes, diving after loose balls, and giving up an open outside shot so a teammate could hit from inside—all things that rarely show up in a box score. \nWhat that work added up to was a 12-year pro career that featured eight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team; the first-ever NBA Sixth Man Award; membership on the ABA All-Rookie Team; four appearances in the NBA All-Star Game and one in the ABA All-Star Game; and perhaps most prized, an NBA Championship with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1983. Above all, Jones's value as a player was evidenced by the fact that his teams never missed the playoffs.\n\"If I was going to ask a youngster to model after someone, I would pick Bobby Jones.\" Said longtime 76ers teammate Julius Erving, \"He's a player who's totally selfless, who runs like a deer, jumps like a gazelle, plays with his head and heart each night, and then walks away from the court as if nothing happened.\"\nAs for his almost polite approach to the game, Jones believed that anything less would have been downright unacceptable. \"If I have to play defense by holding on, that's when I quit,\" Jones said early in his career. \"If I have to use an elbow to get position, then I’m going to have to settle for another position. And if I foul, or if the official makes a mistake, there's no use screaming about it. It won’t change things or make me happier.\"\nOn one of the few occasions Jones did address a referee, it was to point out that the official had called a foul on the wrong player: it was Jones, not a teammate, who was the guilty party. The trusting ref changed his call and assigned the foul to Jones—his fifth of the game. Larry Brown, Jones's coach with the Denver Nuggets, remarked, \"Watching Bobby Jones on the basketball court is like watching an honest man in a liars’ poker game.\"\nAs for vices such as drinking, smoking, and cursing, they were out of the question. When a computer-generated ranking sponsored by Seagram Distillers rated Jones the NBA's \"most consistent and productive player\" in 1976–77, Jones turned over the $10,000 prize to religious charities. At the award dinner (held without alcohol at Jones's request) he pronounced from the podium: \"I’m definitely against whiskey, and I just felt God gave me this money not to keep, but to use.\" And while he never asked teammates or coaches to avoid expletives, they frequently found themselves crying out \"Oh, shoot!\" in his presence.\nNothing seemed to disturb Jones on the court; the final buzzer meant the end of just another day on the job. \"He has a rare ability to divorce himself from the games after they end,\" Dean Smith, Jones's coach at North Carolina, told the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" in 1984. \"He is a man at peace with himself. It's what I term internal affirmation—and in Bobby, it's strong.\"\nJones suffers from asthma, as well as occasional epileptic seizures, and a chronic heart disorder, each of which require medication. Stricken by a seizure in his kitchen one day, Jones fell onto a butcher block and gashed open his head. The incident nearly led him to quit basketball for the clergy. His perseverance earned him Philadelphia's Most Courageous Athlete Award in 1983.\nStrangely, Jones was never in love with the sport of basketball. As a kid growing up in North Carolina, he essentially had to play. His father had played on the Oklahoma Sooners national championship runner-up team of 1949, and older brother Kirby was an All-State cager and later a Sooner as well. Since Kirby versus Mr. Jones did not make for many close matches, Bobby was invariably enlisted to join them in their games behind the house. \"I didn’t enjoy sports,\" Jones remembered. \"I would rather watch television, but my father wanted me to play.\"\nAs a sophomore at South Mecklenburg High School in Charlotte, the 6-foot-6 Jones made the basketball team. His brother Kirby was also on the squad. Bobby actually liked track and field better, because he could practice by himself and on his own terms. Twice he won the state high jump title, finishing second in his junior year to Bob McAdoo. As a senior, Jones broke the state record by clearing the bar at a height of 6 feet, 8 inches.\nJones blossomed on the court in his junior year, earning Charlotte's Player of the Year Award and leading South Mecklenburg into the state playoffs. His squad lost to a Greensboro team that starred McAdoo, but South Mecklenburg won the championship a year later. Still, with all of his success as a cager, Jones did not think much about a future in basketball. \"It was a seasonal thing,\" he said, \"but the colleges became interested, so I thought it was a way I could go to school free.\" Jones ended up playing for Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina.\nJones had a splendid year as a college sophomore, then doctors discovered that he had an irregular heartbeat. Their prescription: a few weeks’ rest. (Jones later had to take medication before every game to control the problem.)\nAt around the same time, tryouts for the 1972 U.S. Olympic Team were about to be held. Jones was not only unaware of the trials, but he also did not know that the Games were being staged in Munich. When Smith heard that a couple of players had been taken ill at the tryouts, he got on the phone and got Jones a shot. Jones made the team but had little time on the court, playing only 5 minutes in the Soviet Union's infamous win over the United States in the gold medal game.\nThe American Basketball Association's Carolina Cougars selected Jones after his junior season in the 1973 Special Circumstances Draft, but Jones wanted to finish his psychology degree and polish his game, so he returned to North Carolina for his senior year. He turned in an All-America campaign in 1973–74, averaging 16.1 points, and was selected by the Houston Rockets with the fifth overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft.\nMeanwhile, the Cougars franchise was moved to Missouri after the 1973–74 season and became the Spirits of St. Louis. Former Carolina Coach Larry Brown had moved on to the Denver Nuggets, and he was hell-bent on getting his hands on Jones. After acquiring his rights from St. Louis in exchange for the rights to Marvin Barnes, the Nuggets outbid Houston for Jones's services, offering him a seven-year, $1.4-million contract.\nWith Brown at the reins and Jones in the frontcourt, Denver went 65–19 in 1974–75, the best record in the ABA that year and the second-best mark in league history. Jones shot .604 from the floor for an ABA record, scored 14.8 points per game, and won a spot on the ABA All-Rookie Team. In 1975–76, the ABA's final season, Jones averaged 14.9 points and 9.5 rebounds and again topped the circuit in field-goal percentage at .581. He also played in the 1976 ABA All-Star Game and was named to the All-ABA Second Team. The Nuggets, with stars David Thompson and Dan Issel, finished with a league-best 60–24 record.\nJones made a graceful transition to the NBA with the ABA–NBA merger in June 1976, as did the rest of the Nuggets. Denver shocked the more established circuit by winning the Midwest Division that season and the next year as well. Thompson was an offensive machine, and Jones made solid contributions at both ends of the floor. In 1976–77 he averaged a career-high 15.1 points, ranked third in the league with a .570 field-goal percentage, and played in his first NBA All-Star Game. He also outpolled all other players in earning the first of eight straight selections to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. The following season Jones averaged 14.5 points, elevated his field-goal percentage to a league-leading .578, and returned to the All-Star Game.\nNuggets management, however, feared Jones would be limited by his health problems. After the 1977–78 campaign he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers with Ralph Simpson for forward George McGinnis. McGinnis lasted a year and a half in Denver; Jones went on to play eight seasons in Philadelphia.\nPrimarily a starter during his four seasons with the Nuggets, Jones was forced to make yet another transition after his first year with the Sixers. Coach Billy Cunningham thought Jones would be best utilized as a sixth man, coming off the bench for frontcourtmen Julius Erving, Darryl Dawkins, and Caldwell Jones. Cunningham was worried that the change would devastate Jones, but it took Jones about half a minute to agree to the coach's plan.\nDuring his first two seasons coming off the bench, beginning with the 1979–80 campaign, Jones still averaged about 25 minutes and 13 to 14 points, shooting at least .530 from the floor each year. He returned to the NBA All-Star Game in both 1981 and 1982 and was an All-Defensive First Team selection each year. In 1981–82, Bobby Jones briefly returned to the starting lineup for that season, starting 73 games.\nWith their system working to near perfection, the 76ers went to the Finals twice during the period, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in both 1980 and 1982. The arrival of workhorse center Moses Malone from Houston prior to the 1982–83 campaign proved to be the final piece of the championship puzzle. In the regular season Malone repeated as league MVP, and Jones won the first-ever NBA Sixth Man Award. Philadelphia then romped through the playoffs, eventually sweeping the Lakers in the 1983 NBA Finals. In game one of the conference finals, the Milwaukee Bucks led by 109–108 with one minute 36 seconds to go. Alton Lister of the Bucks tried to inbound the ball but Jones stole the pass and flipped the ball to Clint Richardson. Richardson scored on a dunk to send the 76ers ahead 110–109. A \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" article on Jones paraphrased the famous John Havlicek call by Johnny Most stating, \"Bobby Jones stole the ball. It was grand larceny. Bobby Jones stole the ball and robbed the Milwaukee Bucks of a game, turning an almost-sure upset into a 111–109 overtime victory for the 76ers.\"\nThe Sixers began a steady decline after that championship year, finishing second to Boston the next three seasons. Jones turned in steady defense and solid numbers during those years, although his playing time and production tailed off gradually. Still, he was as efficient as ever. In his last season, 1985–86, Jones shot .559 from the floor. He retired at age 34, and the Sixers retired his uniform No. 24 shortly afterward.\nJones left the NBA as one of the most admired players of the era, if not of all time. Said a young Charles Barkley while a teammate of Jones's, \"If everyone in the world was like Bobby Jones, the world wouldn’t have any problems.\"\nPost-NBA career.\nIn 2003, Jones cofounded a Charlotte, North Carolina-based religiously affiliated non-profit, 2xsalt, that supports underprivileged youth through sports, along with Bart Kofoed and former teammate and Hall of Famer David Thompson.\nBobby Jones has coached several school basketball teams in the Charlotte area including Charlotte Christian, Carmel Christian School, and the South Charlotte Thunder.\nDuring his entire tenure with the Sixers, Jones' jersey always included the letter B with a period before his last name (B. JONES) above his number 24; he still wore it even after former teammate Caldwell Jones was traded for Moses Malone in 1982 and Caldwell's brother Charles left after only one season with the Sixers (1983–84). However, during the 2008 season, as part of the Sixers' 25th anniversary of the 1983 champions, he was given a framed replica jersey that simply states his last name without the letter B, since he was the only Sixer named Jones to play on the 1983 team.\nOn April 6, 2019, Jones was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nOn January 28, 2020 Joel Embiid requested and was granted permission by Jones to wear his retired jersey number 24 for the Sixers, in honor of the late Kobe Bryant."

        "title": "Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's individual road race",
        "text": "The men's individual road race was a cycling event at the 2004 Summer Olympics. It was held on 14 August 2004. There were 144 competitors from 43 nations. The maximum number of cyclists per nation had been set at five since professionals were allowed in 1996. The event was won by Paolo Bettini of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's individual road race since 1992 and fifth overall (three more than any other nation). Sérgio Paulinho's silver was Portugal's first medal in the event. Belgium earned its first medal in the men's road race since 1964 with Axel Merckx's bronze.\nSummary.\nIn a race that showed numerous break away attempts, it wasn't until Paolo Bettini and Sérgio Paulinho broke away from the group with a couple of laps remaining and opened up a comfortable gap on the final lap that an idea of the medal positions could be gained. With the peloton giving up the chase of the leaders, Axel Merckx broke away to open up a sufficient gap for him to take bronze. Bettini out sprinted Paulinho for the gold, finishing in a time of 5 hours 41 minutes and 44 seconds. Among the other pre-race favourites, World Champion Igor Astarloa of Spain crashed on the opening lap, and 2000 Olympic road race champion Jan Ullrich finished among the peloton in 19th place. A number of other top names in the field, including Germany's Andreas Klöden and Russia's Viatcheslav Ekimov, pulled out before the end of the race, presumably with the Time Trial race, to be held four days later, in mind.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and then at every Summer Olympics since 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial had been re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race. Of the top 10 cyclists from 2000, all three medalists plus three more cyclists returned: gold medalist Jan Ullrich of Germany, silver medalist Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, bronze medalist Andreas Klöden of Germany, sixth-place finisher Frank Høj of Denmark, eighth-place finisher George Hincapie of the United States, and ninth-place finisher Paolo Bettini of Italy. Lance Armstrong, having just won his sixth consecutive Tour de France, did not compete. Reigning world champion Igor Astarloa of Spain did compete.\nSerbia and Montenegro made its debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its 17th appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a 211.2 kilometre course in Athens' Plateia Kozia. Using a city-streets course, \"[r]ather than riding in the hilly country outside of Athens\", resulted in a \"relatively flat course\" that did not challenge the professional peloton.\nResults.\nThere were 75 finishers, with three (plus one non-finisher) later disqualified for doping."

        "title": "American Football League playoffs",
        "text": "For its first nine seasons, 1960 through 1968, the American Football League determined its champion via a single playoff game between the winners of its two divisions (although ties in the standings in 1963 (Eastern) and 1968 (Western) necessitated a tiebreaker divisional playoff game the week before).\nIn 1969, the tenth and final year of the independent ten-team AFL, a four-team playoff was held, with the second-place teams in each division traveling to play the winner of the other division in what were called the \"Interdivisional\" playoffs. These playoffs were not, and are not considered to have been, \"wildcard\" playoffs since the runners-up in both divisions qualified, rather than the two best non-division winners. (Had the 1969 playoffs been true wildcard playoffs, the Western's third-place team, San Diego (8–6–0), would have qualified while the Eastern's runner-up, Houston (6–6–2), would not have.) The 1969 AFL playoffs were only the second time a U.S. major professional football league allowed teams other than the first place teams (including ties) to compete in post-season playoffs (the first was the seven-team All-America Football Conference's 1949 four-team playoff).\nPrior to the advent of the Super Bowl for the 1966 season, the AFL went to great lengths to avoid scheduling its playoffs head-to-head with the NFL. In 1960, the NFL's game was held on Monday, December 26; the AFL had that week off, and played its title contest on Sunday, January 1, as the college bowl games were played on Monday. In 1961 and 1962, the AFL played its game during the off-week between the end of the NFL's regular season and its title game (thus resulting in the AFL holding championship games on December 24, 1961, and December 23, 1962, a week before the NFL's games of December 31, 1961, and December 30, 1962). In 1963, the AFL held its Eastern Division tiebreaker playoff on Saturday, December 28, 1963, thereby avoiding the NFL championship game that Sunday (the AFL championship game was held on January 5). In 1964, pro football had a championship weekend, with the AFL's title game held on Saturday, December 26, and the NFL championship on Sunday. For 1965, the AFL tried to return to the practice of playing its game on a Sunday during the off-week between the NFL playoff, slating its championship contest for December 26, while the NFL's game was not held until January 2, 1966; the Colts and Packers required a Western Conference tiebreaker on the December 26, date --- and since that game went to overtime, the TV audience for the Bills–Chargers title game in San Diego was diminished considerably. Even in 1966, the AFL originally scheduled its championship game for the off-week, planning to hold its playoff on Monday, December 26, six days before the NFL title game on January 1.\nNegotiations prior to the first Super Bowl, in early December 1966, resulted in the two leagues agreeing to have championship doubleheaders for the next four years, with each holding its title game on the same day but staggered, so that television audiences could view both. Thus the final four AFL championship games were held on the same day as the NFL championship game: January 1, 1967; December 31, 1967; December 29, 1968; and January 4, 1970.\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame and the National Football League include AFL playoffs in their statistics for the NFL playoffs.\n1963 Playoffs.\n1963 Championship.\nThe Chargers championship win is noted for being the only and most recent major sports championship won for the city of San Diego. No other city with at least two professional sports teams has a championship drought as long, as of 2020 (57 years). This is also the only time that the Chargers have beaten the Patriots in a postseason game.\n1964 Championship.\nMike Stratton's hit on San Diego Chargers running back Keith Lincoln set the stage for the Buffalo Bills and their first AFL championship.\n1965 Championship.\nThis was the last AFL Championship Game before the Super Bowl era began the following season and the last time a final pro football championship game was played in December. It was also the most recent championship won by a Buffalo-based professional sports team.\n1966 Championship.\nThe Bills went into the 1966 AFL Championship having already won the game the previous two years. Though the game was to be played in Buffalo, the visiting Kansas City Chiefs were three-point favorites, mainly because of their explosive and innovative offense led by Head Coach Hank Stram. The Bills were a more conventional team with a solid defensive line and a running mindset on offense.\nKansas City dominated the game from start to finish, forcing four turnovers (without losing any themselves) and outscoring Buffalo 24–0 over the last three quarters.\nOn the opening kickoff, Fletcher Smith's short kick was fielded by defensive end Dudley Meredith, who promptly fumbled the ball, and KC punter Jerrel Wilson, who also played on the kick coverage team, recovered it for the Chiefs on the Bills 31-yard line. This led to the first score of the game, a 29-yard touchdown pass from Len Dawson to tight end Fred Arbanas. After an exchange of punts, Buffalo tied the game when receiver Elbert Dubenion raced ahead of defensive back Fred Williamson, caught a pass from Jack Kemp at the Chiefs 45, and raced all the way to the end zone for a 69-yard touchdown reception.\nLater on, Mike Garrett's 27-yard punt return gave the Chiefs a first down on the Bills 45-yard line. After a few plays, Dawson made a key 15-yard completion to Arbanas on the Buffalo 29. It was the last catch of the day for Arbanas, who ended up leaving the game with a separated shoulder, but it paid off big time as Dawson threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Otis Taylor on the next play, giving the Chiefs a 14-7 second quarter lead. Buffalo responded with a drive deep into Chiefs territory, featuring Kemp's 30-yard completion to rookie receiver Rob Burnett on the Kansas City 12-yard line. But in what turned out to be one of the most crucial plays of the game, Kemp's next pass was intercepted in the end zone by safety Johnny Robinson, who returned it 72 yards to the Bills 28. Mike Mercer eventually cashed in the turnover with a 32-yard field goal that gave the Chiefs a 17-7 halftime lead.\nThe third quarter was a defensive struggle with each team punting twice. Near the end, Kansas City got the ball on the Bills 42-yard line, but failed to score when Mercer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Chiefs put the game away with consecutive touchdown drives. First, Dawson's 45-yard completion to Chris Burford gave the team a first down on the Buffalo 4-yard line. Garrett then ran the ball on the next four plays, his last carry a 1-yard touchdown run. Then on the first play of Buffalo's next drive, receiver Glenn Bass lost a fumble that was recovered by Bobby Hunt and returned 21 yards to the Bills 20-yard line, leading to the final score of the game on Garrett's 18-yard touchdown burst. Buffalo could do nothing with their next drive, and on their final one of the day, Kemp was intercepted by Emmitt Thomas.\nDawson was near perfect, completing 16/24 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 28 yards. Garrett rushed for 39 yards and two touchdowns, caught 4 passes for 16 yards, returned a kickoff for 3 yards, and added another 37 yards on 3 punt returns. Kemp completed just 12/25 passes for 253 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. Burnett caught 6 passes for 127 yards.\n1967 Championship.\nThe Oakland Raiders were ten and a half point favorites over the Houston Oilers in the 1967 AFL Championship Game. Quarterback Daryle Lamonica, acquired in a trade from the Buffalo Bills in the offseason, led the Raiders to a 13–1 record, throwing 30 touchdown passes in the process. The Oilers went from last place in the Eastern Conference in 1966 to first in '67, beating out the New York Jets by a game. Most of the Oilers' offense centered on big fullback Hoyle Granger, and a midseason quarterback trade for the shifty Pete Beathard (sending their own starter, Jacky Lee, to the Kansas City Chiefs) proved to be the spark that turned Houston's season around.\nThe previous meeting between the two teams had been a close game won 19-7 by the Raiders, with Lamonica struggling offensively. This was not the case in the rematch. Oakland took a 10–0 lead in the second quarter on a 69-yard run down the left sidelines by Hewritt Dixon, and on a fake field goal attempt Lamonica passed to Dave Kocourek for the 17-0 halftime margin. Former Oilers quarterback George Blanda, who had led Houston to the AFL's first two championships, kicked four field goals for the Raiders. Houston did not score until the fourth quarter, when they already trailed 30–0.\nOakland lost Super Bowl II to the NFL champion Green Bay Packers.\n1968 Playoffs.\n1968 Championship.\nThe Jets went on to win Super Bowl III to become the first AFL Super Bowl champion.\n1969 Playoffs.\n1969 Championship.\nThis was the final AFL Championship Game, as well as the final game played between two AFL teams before the merger with the National Football League. The Chiefs won Super Bowl IV as the last AFL champion."

Along with Turk Broda, he was the first player in NHL history to win five Stanley Cups, and he was the last Maple Leaf to win the Hart Trophy for most valuable player, until Auston Matthews in 2022. He was an essential contributor to the Maple Leafs becoming what many consider as the National Hockey League's first dynasty. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966. He has been called the quintessential Maple Leaf and by some the greatest player in the team's history. In 2017 Kennedy was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\nKennedy was raised in the small Ontario town of Humberstone, now Port Colborne. Kennedy was born just eleven days after his father was killed in a hunting accident. His mother, left alone to raise four children, took a job at the local hockey arena which became Kennedy's second home. After a stellar junior hockey career, Kennedy first came to the attention of the Montreal Canadiens and attended their training camp while still in high school. Disappointed and heart sick at the idea of not playing for his favourite team, Montréal who owned his rights eventually traded him to Toronto for defensemen Frank Eddols. A move that contributed to the falling out between Conn Smythe who was away fighting the war with the 48th Highlanders in Europe, and Frank Selke who was left behind to manage the team, resulting in the latter eventually leaving the Leafs organization for the Canadiens. \nAlthough young, Kennedy was successful with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished second on the team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself as the leader of the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A \"Sports Illustrated\" poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.\nYouth.\nTed \"Teeder\" Kennedy was born December 12, 1925, in the small village of Humberstone, Ontario, which in 1970 was amalgamated into the city of Port Colborne. Ted's father, Gordon Kennedy, was killed in a hunting accident eleven days before he was born and his mother, Margaret, was left to raise a family of four children. To supplement her income she took a job selling confectioneries at a local hockey arena which became young Ted's second home. When Ted was seven years old a family friend took him to Toronto to see the first two games of the 1932 Stanley Cup Finals and from watching those games Maple Leaf right winger Charlie Conacher became his childhood hero. He wore Conacher's no. 9 throughout his minor hockey career. In Port Colborne, Kennedy was childhood friends with Elmer Iseler, who found fame as a choir conductor and Don Gallinger who became infamous when he was banned for life by the NHL for gambling while playing with the Boston Bruins in 1948.\nKennedy played with the Port Colborne Lions in the Ontario Minor Hockey Association as a bantam, midget and juvenile. His nickname \"Teeder\" is a short form of his real name which was used by other neighbourhood boys because they could not pronounce \"Theodore\" and was overheard by a local reporter with the Welland Tribune. During Kennedy's NHL years, newspapers often used the spelling \"Teeter\". Kennedy was captain of the midget Port Colborne Lions when they won the O.M.H.A. Championship in 1941. The \"Toronto Star\" described the 15-year-old Kennedy as a \"shifty rightwinger\" who had \"paced the Lions to victory, scoring five goals, two of which were solo efforts.\" On May 7, 1941, at a banquet in Port Colborne honouring the championship team, one of the speakers was Hap Day, coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He spoke to the players, advising them that \"keen desire\" and \"hard work\" was required to get to the top in hockey as in any job in life and that hockey salaries were \"equal to other leading professions\". Day then presented members of the team with jackets bearing the championship crest. In only two years, Kennedy was playing for Hap Day's Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe next season Kennedy's juvenile team made it to the finals. During the season, Kennedy had scored seven goals in one game and six in another and it was efforts such as those which were attracting the attention of professional hockey people. The first team to approach Kennedy was the NHL's Montreal Canadiens, although for Kennedy \"It was a boyhood dream to play for Toronto.\" Dinty Moore, also of Port Colborne, brought Kennedy to the attention Montreal General Manager Tommy Gorman and Kennedy was put on their negotiation list. In the fall of 1942, Montreal contacted the sixteen-year-old about joining the Canadiens. Kennedy's mother was wary of a career in hockey for her son as he was also headed towards studying business at the University of Western Ontario. She agreed to let her son attend the training camp when Montreal scout Dinty Moore assured her Ted was going to receive a good education at Montreal's prestigious Lower Canada College and they were going to cover the cost. Upon arriving in Montreal, foreshadowing future troubles, Kennedy discovered there was no one from the Canadiens to greet him at the train. The teenager was left to his own devices to check into a hotel and make his way around the new city. Then later, as he tried to combine hockey and school, he became concerned his studies were suffering and approached Canadien management to ask if they could find him accommodation closer to the school. He felt they were unresponsive and he soon became disillusioned with the experience in Montreal. After three weeks in Montreal he was feeling homesick and upon completing spring training with the Montreal Royals, he returned to Port Colborne in mid-November.\nBack home, Kennedy played with the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942–43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with teaching him how to \"operate in front of the net\". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, \"Well, you know, Ted, if you turn pro, it will have to be with the Canadiens.\" Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him \"a coming great\", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first worried about what he may have done wrong, but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.\nPlaying career.\nStyle of play.\nAlthough Kennedy was not a gifted skater, he compensated with a fierce determination and tireless hard work. Among modern era players his style of play has been compared to Bobby Clarke and Jarome Iginla. Line-mate Howie Meeker said that while he was a much better skater than Kennedy, . Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's coaching style of emphasizing defense, positional hockey and physical play. He brought to the Leafs a classy, humble leadership and the knack for scoring goals when they were most needed. He fought for every inch of ice and was difficult to separate from the puck. He was also known for his agility, stick-handling, playmaking, passing skills and physical toughness.\nDick Irvin once compared the styles of Syl Apps, previous captain of the Leafs, to Kennedy in how the two centres used their wingers. \"Apps used to hit the defense at top speed and Gordie Drillon would come along and pick up the garbage\", said Irvin, whereas Kennedy would \"go into the corners and get the puck out to their wings.\" Hap Day had said he could see Nels Stewart's influence on Kennedy. Like Stewart, Kennedy had a more upright lie on his hockey stick which kept the puck closer to his feet. Kennedy was also widely believed to be the best faceoff man in hockey and seldom lost an important faceoff. Along with his regular shift, he also played a role on the penalty kill.\nMaking the team.\nOn March 3, 1943, Kennedy signed a professional contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs, but management of the Leafs still wished to see Kennedy playing in an NHL game. Late in the 1942–43 season, they received permission from Kennedy's mother to take him out of school so he could accompany them on a road trip. He played in two of the final three games of the regular season, but did not continue with them into the playoffs. Making his NHL debut March 7, 1943, against the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, he was put on the Leafs' third line on rightwing, instead of his customary centre position, on a line with Bud Poile and Gaye Stewart. He was told by coach Hap Day to simply \"stay with your check and keep him from scoring.\" Kennedy's line scored three goals and he picked up one assist in a 5–5 tie. He then picked another assist in the next game in Boston. Kennedy had impressed the Leaf coaches, but his rights were still \"officially\" owned by the Montreal Canadiens.\nToronto first tried to buy his rights from Montreal, but a trade was arranged exchanging Kennedy for Frank Eddolls. Toronto newspapers of the day in reporting the trade described the 17-year-old Kennedy as \"a rangy youngster whose record in the OHA is exceptionally good\", that he was \"highly recommended by other hockey men\" and was a \"high-scoring right-winger\". Nevertheless, interim manager Frank Selke had made the trade while Conn Smythe, owner of the Leafs, was away in service in World War II and Eddolls was one of his prized prospects. Smythe was furious when he discovered the trade, creating a rift between the two which ultimately led Selke to leave Toronto to manage the Canadiens. Ironically, Kennedy eventually became Smythe's favourite player and he called Kennedy \"the greatest competitor in hockey\". Looking back, some hockey pundits have called the trade the best the Toronto Maple Leafs have ever made. In 2001, Sports Illustrated writer and Montreal native, Michael Farber, included the Kennedy trade for Eddolls as one of \"the five darkest days\" in Montreal Canadiens' history.\nKennedy played full-time with the Leafs for the first time in the 1943–44 season. Although the Leafs had won the Stanley Cup in 1942, at the time of Kennedy's arrival the Leafs were a team decimated by the loss of some of its best players to the war effort. Andy Lytle, sports editor of \"The Toronto Star\", wrote of the Leaf team eliminated from the previous season's playoffs, \"I do not suppose that Toronto was so weakly represented in the N.H.L. playoffs since the club originated.\" During training camp, Kennedy read in a newspaper interview of Coach Hap Day speaking about the best new prospects on the Leafs, but he had failed to mention Kennedy. This served to fire up Kennedy to give an even greater effort towards making the team. Toronto's first pre-season exhibition game was against the St. Catharine Saints, a senior team now being coached by Kennedy's former junior coach Nels Stewart. After the game, Kennedy approached Stewart for advice, because he was disappointed he had not scored in the game. Stewart, who was the all-time NHL goal scoring leader until Maurice Richard overtook him in the 1952–53 season, advised when facing the goaltender to \"either draw him out, or pick the corner.\"\nKennedy began the season playing right wing. Then, in mid-December, Leaf centre Mel Hill fractured his ankle. This gave Kennedy his first opportunity to play regularly at the centre position, where he remained for most of his career. In a January 8 game at Maple Leaf Gardens against the Boston Bruins, the mayor of Port Colborne presented Kennedy and Don Gallinger with gold watches on behalf of his town's citizens. Kennedy finished the season as the team's second best goal-scorer with 26 and was fourth in points. He was just 18 years old. In the playoffs, Toronto faced the powerful Montreal Canadiens. Although Toronto won the first game 3–1, they were then swept in the next four and eliminated from the playoffs. The \"Toronto Daily Star\" said of Kennedy's rookie season, \"For our money the best rookie of the year though playing with one of the weakest lines in N.H.L. history.\" Kennedy was ineligible for the rookie-of-the-year award because of the two games he played with the Leafs at the end of the 1942–43 season.\nThe first Stanley Cup and the great upset.\nIn only his second NHL season, Kennedy finished the 1944–45 regular season leading the team in goals and points with 29 goals and 25 assists. In the last game of the season against the New York Rangers, Kennedy's line-mates fed him pass after pass attempting to get him to 30 goals. The Maple Leafs finished in third place and faced the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs. The Canadiens of 1944–45 were a record-breaking, powerhouse hockey team. Going into the playoffs, their coach, Dick Irvin, declared them as the greatest team to have ever played in the NHL. The Montreal club had the top three point leaders in the league, placed 5 of the 6 positions on the first All-Star team, Maurice Richard had scored his famous 50 goals in 50 games, Montreal had finished 28 points ahead of Toronto and scored almost a goal-per-game more. As of 2009, Montreal's regular season winning percentage for 1944–45 is the fifth highest in NHL history and the year previously they had achieved the second highest in history and won the Stanley Cup. The Leafs were given little chance of winning the series.\nAs with all NHL playoff series of the era, the winner was the first team to win four games of a best-of-seven. Going into the series, Hap Day made a critical decision to predominantly play only two lines of his best players to compensate for the Canadiens' depth in talent. The first game was in Montreal and no goals were scored for the first two periods. In the third period, with just twenty-two seconds remaining and everyone anticipating overtime, Ted Kennedy banked a backhand shot off the goalpost which then rebounded off goaltender Bill Durnan's pads and into the net to win the game 1–0. The goal shocked the Montreal team, especially as the famed \"Punch Line\" had been held scoreless. In the second game, also in Montreal, Kennedy struck again only four minutes into the first period scoring the all-important first goal to put the Toronto ahead by 1–0. Toronto went on to win the game 3–2 and were able to leave Montreal with an unexpected 2–0 series lead. Montreal won the next game in Toronto 4–1. In the fourth game in Toronto, Montreal got off to a quick start and led 2–0 on goals by Elmer Lach and Richard, his first of the series, before the game was three minutes old. In the second period, Kennedy set up Mel Hill to get Toronto back in the game and the Leafs went on to win in overtime. As Toronto needed only one more victory to win the series, Montreal was facing elimination in game five in Montreal. Maurice Richard finally overcame Leaf checking and scored four goals in an 11–3 victory. However, Toronto won the sixth game in Maple Leaf Gardens 3–2 to win the series and complete the shocking upset. In the game, Toronto's Elwyn Morris, a defenceman who had scored only one goal all season, sparked the Leafs when he stole the puck from Montreal defenceman Frank Eddolls to score the first goal of the game. Eddolls was the player traded to Montreal to bring Kennedy to Toronto. This series is considered one of the greatest upsets in NHL history.\nOn completion of the Montreal series, \"the Globe and Mail\" said of the 19-year-old Kennedy, \"Ted Kennedy's all-round display was the best individual performance of the six-game set.\" The \"Toronto Star\" was even more laudatory \"There are a few great hockey players in the N.H.L. today. Kennedy is assuredly and emphatically one.\" Kennedy said that the 1945 upset of the Canadiens was the peak event of his career.\nToronto faced Detroit in the Stanley Cup Finals. Toronto won the first three games of the series without giving up a goal, as rookie goaltender Frank McCool recorded consecutive shutouts. Toronto then had to ward off a determined Detroit comeback bid, before winning the Stanley Cup in the seventh game. Kennedy had continued with a strong performance against Detroit, scoring the game-winning goal in game 2, was chosen the first star (best player) of game 3 and scored all three goals in a 5–3 loss in game 5.\nConn Smythe realized the importance of finding the right line-mates for Kennedy, telling coach Hap Day in September 1945, \"we must get something really rapid to team up with this guy and we'll be set for a decade with a first rate front line.\" Smythe's first attempt was to acquire future Hockey Hall of Famer Edgar Laprade, at the time a star in senior hockey whose rights were owned by the New York Rangers. A deal could not be made as New York General Manager Lester Patrick was asking for several players in return.\nAfter the triumph of the previous season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost for the rest of the season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.\nThe NHL's \"first dynasty\".\nOn September 19, 1946, an informal ceremony was held in which former Leaf great Charlie Conacher presented Ted Kennedy with his No. 9 sweater he had worn during his career. Conacher had been Kennedy's boyhood hero, but when Kennedy arrived Lorne Carr already wore No.9. Kennedy was initially given No.12, then switched to No. 10. When Kennedy heard Carr was retiring, he immediately wrote a letter to Leaf management requesting No.9. His Leaf teammates had always teased Kennedy about his compulsion, so they contacted Conacher and arranged for the ceremony. Conacher, now working as a broker, explaining why he was willing to take time off work said \"He's a good kid and a great player. You just can't disappoint a guy like that.\"\nConn Smythe instituted a major rebuilding campaign for the 1946–47. Gone from the team was Sweeney Schriner, Lorne Carr, Bob Davidson, Mel Hill, Elwin Morris, Babe Pratt, Billy Taylor and new additions were Harry Watson, Jimmy Thomson, Gus Mortson, Garth Boesch, Joe Klukay, Don Metz, Vic Lynn and Howie Meeker. The team was very young, with six rookies in the lineup, and was felt to be two years away from challenging for the championship. However, some of those rookies, such as Boesch and Meeker, had just returned from the war and were more mature than most. As Hap Day observed, \"They'd been through real battles.\"\nKennedy said that during this period, with all the changes on the team and with players returning from the war he had to \"re-establish myself as an NHLer.\" Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy was going to turn out to be just a \"wartime flash in the pan\". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. \"Come on, Teeder!\" was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.\nKennedy became famous across Canada from the radio broadcasts of Foster Hewitt. It was not until the 1952–53 season that hockey games were broadcast on television in Canada.\nKennedy now centered a line between Howie Meeker and Vic Lynn and they clicked \"immediately\". These were the line-mates Smythe had been trying to find for Kennedy since 1945. Kennedy served as the playmaker between the fast skating and goal scoring of Meeker and Lynn. Meeker had just returned from the war and Lynn had come up from the American league and both were hungry to stay in the NHL. \"We were very eager people\", Kennedy recalled. The line soon acquired the nickname the \"KLM\" line.\nAt the end of the season Kennedy led the Leafs in points and they finished in second place to Montreal. In the first round of the playoffs Toronto faced Detroit. Except for a one-sided 9–1 loss in the second game in Detroit, Toronto dominated the series and won in five games. Toronto now faced Montreal for the Stanley Cup. The match up was between the very young Maple Leafs and the veteran Montreal Canadiens who had dominated the NHL for the past four years. After Toronto lost the opening game by a one-sided 6–0, Canadien goaltender Bill Durnan was quoted in a Montreal newspaper as saying, \"How did the Maple Leafs manage to get into the playoffs?\" Hap Day used the quote to inspire his team. In the second game, Kennedy opened the scoring at 1:12 of the game then assisted on line-mate Lynn's goal on the next face-off putting the Leafs up 2–0 at less than 2 minutes into the game. Toronto went on to win the game 4–0. In game 3 Toronto had built a 3–0 lead by halfway through the second, but Montreal battled back to close the gap to 3–2. With Montreal pressing in the dying seconds of the game, Kennedy dug the puck out of a desperate scramble in front of the Toronto goalmouth, carried the puck up ice, then forcing goaltender Durnan to go down, he put the puck behind him to clinch the game. Toronto won game 4 in overtime 2–1 while the Canadiens won game 5 in Montreal 3–1. Kennedy's line came up with their best game of the series in game 6. Montreal had taken an early two-goal lead and appeared to be heading for a seventh game in Montreal. In the second period, Lynn tied the game with assists from Kennedy and Meeker. Then in the third with less than six minutes to go in the game Kennedy scored and Toronto held on to win the Stanley Cup.\nKennedy was voted the star in two of Toronto's wins in Montreal, scoring the winning goal in both, and was described as the most determined player in the playoffs. He still holds the NHL all-time record as the youngest player to score a Stanley Cup winning goal. Kennedy finished the playoffs leading the Leafs in points and was second overall. However, despite winning the Stanley Cup the Toronto Maple Leafs did not place a single player on either the first or second All-Star teams.\n\"Strongest team ever\".\nThe 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in what has been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third line, behind Apps and Kennedy. Decades later, Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and \"The Globe and Mail\" reporter Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have been relegated to the fourth line on this Leaf team.\nThe Leafs finished in first place at the end of the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, then lifted the puck over him. In the Cup Finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.\nOn the afternoon of Thursday, April 16, 1948, the Leaf players were greeted by thousands of Toronto fans as they got off the train from Detroit. They then rode open cars through a cascade of multi-coloured paper and ticket tape through Toronto's business district to arrive at a civic reception at City Hall. Speaking to the huge crowd, Conn Smythe announced that Kennedy was succeeding Syl Apps as captain who was retiring.\nIn the off-season, on Saturday, June 12, 1948, Kennedy married Doreen Dent of Toronto in Knox College Chapel in Toronto.\nThe Leafs struggled early in the 1948–49 season having lost Apps and Nick Metz to retirement, and then Kennedy for a month and Cal Gardner for two months due to injuries. By the end of January, Toronto was only one point ahead of the last place New York Rangers who had even played two fewer games than Toronto. Kennedy's return to the team in mid-January provided the needed spark to pull the Leafs out of their prolonged slump. Although finishing the regular season with a losing record of 23 wins 25 losses and 12 ties, they were able to place fourth, which was the last position qualifying for the playoffs. However, in the first round of the playoffs they defeated Boston in five games. Kennedy had scored the game-winning goal which put Toronto up 3–0 in games. Toronto then faced the first-place Detroit Red Wings. During the season, Detroit General Manager Jack Adams said of the Red Wings, \"This is the greatest team in my 22 seasons here.\" However, Toronto swept the Red Wings in four straight games to win their third consecutive Stanley Cup. Kennedy finished the playoffs with two goals and six assists to lead the Leafs in points and was second only to Detroit's Gordie Howe overall.\nThis was the first time a National Hockey League team had won three Cups in a row and had not been accomplished since the Ottawa Silver Seven in the pre-NHL era, 44 years before. The Leafs had also won nine consecutive Stanley Cup Finals games dating back to April 19, 1947 (initial cup won on this date, with the following two wins being finals sweeps). This Toronto Maple Leafs team is distinguished as the first dynasty in the history of the NHL.\nThe Gordie Howe incident.\nAt the beginning of the 1949–50, Conn Smythe liked the Leafs' chances for continued success, saying, \"We'll be hard to keep away from a fourth Stanley Cup,\" but as the season progressed many hockey people felt Detroit would end the Leafs' Stanley Cup streak. By the end of the season, Toronto had finished in third and Kennedy finished second on the Leafs in points.\nThe 1950 playoffs were overshadowed by an on-ice mishap in the opening game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was carrying it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, and was able to dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, \"I don't know how he got it. I avoided his check along the boards and didn't feel anything hit me, although he may have struck my stick.\"\nNHL President Clarence Campbell was at the game and was seated near where the incident occurred. After receiving a report from the game's officials, Campbell called a news conference and said the injury was not Kennedy's fault. Campbell also publicly rebuked Ivan for his accusation, saying, \"That is a pretty serious business and a very vicious charge.\" It was also argued that since Kennedy was a right-handed shot, the butt-end of his stick was towards the boards and away from Howe. Sportswriter Ted Reeve of the \"Toronto Telegram\" quipped, \"How would a right-handed stickhandler going down the left boards give anyone a butt end? Unless he wanted to lift the snappers out of someone in the rail seats.\" Howe was lost from the playoffs, but the incident influenced the momentum of the series. Detroit won the second game of the series 3–1, a violent and fight-filled affair which included a stick-swinging incident between the Leafs' Jimmy Thomson and Detroit's Leo Reise and a fight between Kennedy and Ted Lindsay. After the game, Campbell threatened the players with fines if the violent play continued, and both teams continued to play hockey for the remainder of the series. However, Detroit was now determined to \"win the series for Gordie\" and defeated the Leafs in seven strongly-contested games to eliminate them from the playoffs, going on to win the Stanley Cup.\nIn recovery from his hospital bed, Howe said, \"Ted is too good a player to deliberately injure another player.\" Then, years later, while still believing that he had been hit by Kennedy's stick, Howe reiterated that there was no intent to injure on Kennedy's part and considered his injuries self-inflicted. However, the incident still continues at times to be described as a deliberate act by Kennedy. In 2001, \"The Sporting News\" ran an article on the 30 toughest players in the NHL. In referring to Howe's injury, the incident was described \"he was knocked heavily into the boards by Toronto's Teeder Kennedy\".\nThe Final Cup.\nExcept for being left with a lifelong facial tick, Howe made a full recovery and for the 1950–51 season as he finished the season leading the league in points. The Maple Leafs finished in second place behind Detroit. Kennedy finished second on the team in points behind Bentley and tied with Howe for the league lead in assists with 43. In the first round of the playoffs Montreal upset Detroit and Toronto defeated Boston.\nThe Stanley Cup Finals between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is remarkable as each game required overtime to be decided. In the third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved the game for the Leafs and won it. First, he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later at the other end of the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.\nIt was in the next game of the series which Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko scored one of the most famous goals in NHL history with a goal in overtime to win the Stanley Cup. However, without Kennedy's face-off skills Barilko's goal would not have occurred. Montreal had been leading late in the game 2–1 and it appeared that the teams were headed to a sixth game in Montreal. With just 39 seconds remaining, Toronto was able to get a faceoff in the Montreal end. Toronto coach Joe Primeau had pulled the goaltender so they could have six skaters. Primeau had the option of changing his players, but decided to leave Kennedy out to take the faceoff against Canadien Billy Reay. Kennedy's plan on the faceoff was to get the puck to Max Bentley, who was stationed at the point. Then Montreal coach Dick Irvin decided to switch and have his best forwards, the Punch Line, out for this critical faceoff. Kennedy faced Lach instead. Kennedy later recalled he was relieved at the switch as he had trouble with Reay on faceoffs, but when Lach came out he felt \"I had a chance,\" Kennedy won the faceoff from Lach, got the puck to Bentley and from the ensuing scramble around the net Tod Sloan tied the game. The goal dispirited the Montreal team and led to Barilko's famed overtime goal which won another Stanley Cup for the Leafs.\nFollowing the 1951 cup, Kennedy said that without the Howe incident of the previous season, \"we probably would have been the first team to win 5 in a row.\"\nLatter years.\n 1950–51 season was Kennedy's last Stanley Cup. In the years following until Kennedy's retirement in 1957 the Leafs either finished out of the playoffs or lost in the first round. However, Kennedy continued to play productive hockey. The Leafs never missed the playoffs in the years Kennedy played a full season.\nOn October 13, 1951, the Leafs and the Chicago Black Hawks played an afternoon exhibition of hockey, prior to their regularly scheduled evening game, for Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II, during her visit to Canada. It was captain Teeder Kennedy, representing the players, who greeted the Princess at the game. Kennedy said it was a thrilling moment and recalled thinking at the time, \"Here's a kid from the little village of Humberstone, Ontario being presented to the Queen.\" The 1951–52 season was dominated by Gordie Howe and the Red Wings as they finished the regular season in first and then swept third place Toronto in the first round of the playoffs and Montreal in second round without losing a single game.\nIn a game in Boston in January of the 1952–53 season Kennedy suffered a separated shoulder in a scuffle with Milt Schmidt of the Bruins and underwent surgery. Originally thought lost for the season, Kennedy trained hard and was able to return to the Leafs in mid-March. However, Toronto still finished out of a playoff position. Despite missing more than two months of the schedule Kennedy still finished second in points on the team. For his efforts Kennedy received the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy which is awarded by the Maple Leaf Gardens board of directors as the player most valuable to the Leafs.\nFor the 1953–54 season, Kennedy finished tied for second on the team in points and was elected to the NHL's 2nd All-Star team. The Leafs finished in 3rd place and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Detroit in five games. At the end of the season, Kennedy announced his intentions to retire. Conn Smythe told reporters he had tendered Kennedy \"the highest offer ever made a hockey player\". This was a raise above his $25,000 yearly salary (approximately $ in dollars) according to a contemporary newspaper report. However, Smythe said that Kennedy had told him that lately he felt \"he hadn't produced in proportion to what he's been paid.\" Smythe insisted the Leafs needed Kennedy as Toronto was a young team.\nSmythe was able to talk Kennedy into playing the 1954–55 season. At the conclusion of the season, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy, for most valuable player, and would be the last Maple Leaf to win the award until Auston Matthews in 2022. To this point Kennedy had had an impressive career. He had played on five Stanley Cup teams, something no other NHL player had achieved at the time. Toronto had only missed the playoffs twice during his eleven years, one of which Kennedy was injured. By age 22 he had won three Stanley Cups and was the youngest player to have scored 100 goals. Yet, Kennedy had never won an award, nor been elected to a first All-Star team. Although he did finish third in the league in assists, awarding Kennedy the Hart was considered as much as an acknowledgement of his career as his performance in the season. Kennedy along with first ever Hart recipient Frank Nighbor, are the only forwards to have won the award without finishing in the top ten in league scoring. After the Leafs were swept in four straight games in the playoffs by the Detroit Red Wings, Kennedy announced his retirement. For the second time, Kennedy was awarded with the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy as most valuable Toronto Maple Leaf.\nAfter missing the entire 1955–56 season, he came out of retirement to play half of the 1956–57 season to help the Leafs who were short on players due to injuries and were struggling to make the playoffs. Kennedy returned November 27 to train himself back into shape after the Leafs had won only one game in their last 11. He scored 22 points in 30 games, but the Leafs finished out of the playoffs. He shared the captaincy with Jim Thomson. A highlight of the season was March 16, 1957, when the Maple Leafs scored 14 goals against the New York Rangers and Kennedy got four assists in what is still the Leafs' all-time record for goals in a single game. When it became clear the team was not going to make the playoffs, he sat out the last two games so the management could have a look at a young Frank Mahovlich. Kennedy said, \"It was time for a new generation to lead the team.\" Mahovlich had practiced with Kennedy the previous day and, in expressing regret at never having played in a game with Kennedy said, \"Teeder Kennedy's last practice was my first.\"\nDuring Detroit Red Wing Ted Lindsay's attempts to form a players' union in the 1950s, he was approaching selected leaders among the other five NHL teams. Although Kennedy was the lone holdout, which greatly disappointed Lindsay, he still respected Kennedy for not informing Conn Smythe about being approached. \"I won't squeal\", Kennedy told him. According to Glenn Hall, Conn Smythe \"ostracized\" his captain when he discovered Kennedy had not told him about Lindsay's endeavors. There was speculation that this led to Kennedy failing to land a job with the Leafs after retirement.\nRetirement.\nKennedy continued for a short time after retirement as a salesman with Canadian Building Materials, with whom he had worked for during his hockey career in the off-season, but soon left the company. In 1957–58, he was the second coach of the Peterborough Petes OHA \"Junior A\" team before being succeeded by Scotty Bowman. After a successful season coaching Peterborough, Kennedy reportedly turned down an offer to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs prior to their signing of Punch Imlach.\nHe returned to Port Colborne to raise thoroughbred horses, which was an occupation he had been involved during his hockey career. Kennedy owned the Faraway Hills Farm and the St. Marys Thoroughbred Training Centre in Ontario which included a quarter-mile indoor track. His horse, \"On Board\", won the grand championship for stallions three times at the Canadian National Exhibition and at the Royal Winter Fair.\nIn 1966 Ted Kennedy was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1975, an arena in Port Colborne, the \"Teeder Kennedy Youth Arena\", was named in his honour.\nKennedy was a steward with the Ontario Racing Commission from 1977 to 1985. In June 1979, Kennedy was one of three stewards who scratched \"Come Lucky Chance\" from the $100,000 Canadian Oaks after the horse had thrown its rider prior to the race. Infuriated by the ruling was the horse's owner, 84-year-old Conn Smythe. Although, Smythe was quoted as saying, \"I'll raise hell with only two of the stewards.\" In July 1984, Kennedy was one of the stewards for the Queen's Plate, who ruled against an appeal by Larry Attard riding \"Let's Go Blue\" that he was interfered with by the winning horse \"Key To The Moon\". Kennedy was then head of security at Fort Erie Racetrack.\nIn 1987, Kennedy appeared along with Leaf defenseman of the 1970s, Jim McKenny, in an educational video for the Ontario Government on the dangers to athletes of drug and alcohol abuse. Kennedy, an abstainer, said he was always considered \"one of the boys\" on the team even through he did not drink. Kennedy's stellar career contrasted with McKenny, considered along with Bobby Orr as the best prospects in junior, had his career negatively impacted by alcoholism.\nDuring his retirement, Kennedy also participated in Old-Timers hockey for charity benefits. He was also an avid golfer, scoring a 215-yard hole in one in 1981 at Scarboro Golf and Country Club.\nOn October 3, 1993, Kennedy, along with Syl Apps, were honoured in a pre-game ceremony by having banners raised at Maple Leaf Gardens.\nIn 1995, it was reported Kennedy had again returned to live in the hometown of his youth Port Colborne. In 1999, Kennedy underwent hip replacement surgery.\nTed Kennedy was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.\nTed Kennedy died on August 14, 2009, in a Port Colborne nursing home, at the age of 83, of congestive heart failure. He is survived by his wife Doreen, son Mark, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.\nFollowing the announcement of Kennedy's passing, many fans and papers published tributes, while former NHL players paid their respects. Jean Béliveau, a former member of the rival Montreal Canadiens, expressed sadness upon the news, stating \"I was certainly happy to play against him, and I'm so sorry to hear (of his death)\". He added, \"He was a complete centreman, a good playmaker, a good passer, good on faceoffs.\" Brian Burke, the Leafs' general manager at the time of Kennedy's passing, issued a statement, reading \"He truly was a man of great class and he was one of the most accomplished leaders in our team's long history.\" NHL commissioner Gary Bettman also issued a statement mourning Kennedy's loss.\nLegacy.\nThe quintessential Leaf.\nTed Kennedy never played for another team, never wanted to, and captained the Toronto Maple Leafs during its greatest era. He has been called the quintessential Maple Leaf. However, Kennedy was never voted to the first All-Star team. Frank Selke explained Kennedy \"never made the first All-Star team because he lacked one thing – colour. He's been unlucky that way.\" On another occasion Selke had said, \"Many times men were named who were not his equal in all-round effectiveness.\" Despite Kennedy's sparse acquisition of individual awards, many sportswriters consider Kennedy as possibly the greatest player to have played for the Toronto Maple Leafs. In the book \"The Maple Leafs Top 100\" Kennedy is ranked second only to Dave Keon as the best Toronto Maple Leaf of all time. While \"The Hockey News\" ranked Kennedy at only #57 on their list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, in 2009 The Edmonton Journal published a list of top 50 NHL players of All-Time and Ted Kennedy finished at #10, ahead of all other Maple Leafs and such players as Howie Morenz and Patrick Roy. The list, with the intention of minimizing subjectivity, was compiled using voting for the Hart and Smythe trophies for most valuable player during the regular season and playoffs respectively. When the list was adjusted to account for the fact that goalies and defensemen are traditionally overlooked for the Hart, Kennedy's ranking even improved to #8.\nPlayoff performer.\nKennedy had the reputation for excelling in the playoffs. He was the first player in NHL history to win five Stanley Cups and by just age 22 he had already won three Stanley Cups. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in Stanley Cup Finals with 23. He is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal when he scored the winning goal of game 6 in 1947 at 21.4 years of age. Until the Pittsburgh Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009, with 22-year-old Sidney Crosby as captain, Kennedy shared the honours with Wayne Gretzky as the youngest captains to have won the Cup. In 2001 The Hockey News assembled a panel of five hockey experts to choose the winners of a \"would-be\" Conn Smythe Trophy, for best playoff performance, had the trophy been awarded prior to the 1964–65 season. Using microfilms of newspapers of the day and studying statistics and quotes from writers and coaches they chose winners from 1917–18 to 1963–64. Only Kennedy was chosen as many as three times for his playoff performances in 1945, 1947 and 1948. He is fourth all-time in playoff goals and sixth all-time in points for the Maple Leafs\nFace-off skills.\nHis face-off skills were highly regarded and it was considered invaluable. The April 27, 1998, issue of Sport Illustrated published \"The Best Ever on the Draw\", a poll of NHL experts of the top ten players of all time for skills on the faceoff, and Kennedy was ranked at #1. Lloyd Percival once called Kennedy the \"Billy the Kid\" of hockey. Derek Sanderson, considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s, related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill. In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter, \"I went all-out at face-offs. Your centre is your quarterback and our other guys knew exactly what I was trying to do.\" In the 1970s, GM of the Leafs, Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face-off performance. Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation. \"This can't involve (just) the centermen. It has to involve all five guys,\" Kennedy told Gregory and coach Roger Neilson. \"Everyone has to be in tune. Everybody has a job to do. This is a team.\""

        "title": "1973–74 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1973 season began on December 22, 1973. The postseason tournament concluded with the Miami Dolphins defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII, 24–7, on January 13, 1974, at Rice Stadium in Houston, Texas.\nLike the previous NFL seasons, the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly divisional rotation, excluding the wild card teams who would always play on the road.\nThis was the first NFL postseason in which none of the twelve \"old guard\" NFL teams played in the conference championship games.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl VIII.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 22, 1973.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 27, Washington Redskins 20.\nMinnesota scored 17 points in the fourth quarter to overcome a 13–10 deficit, including two touchdowns in a span of 1:05.\nBoth offenses struggled in the first quarter. The Vikings were completely unable to move the ball, finishing the quarter without any first downs, while Washington kicker Curt Knight missed two field goal attempts. One miss was from 49 yards and the other from 17, spoiling an impressive drive that saw the Redskins drive from their own 14 to inside the Vikings 10-yard line.\nMinnesota finally managed to get rolling in the second quarter, with a 50-yard completion from Tarkenton to running back Oscar Reed setting up Fred Cox's 19-yard field goal. But with 3:30 left in the half, Vikings cornerback Bobby Bryant fumbled a punt return that was recovered by Redskins running back Bob Brunet on the Minnesota 21-yard line. Billy Kilmer then completed a 17-yard pass to Charley Taylor before Larry Brown scored on a 3-yard touchdown run to give the Redskins a 7–3 lead. Minnesota responded with a drive into field goal range, but Mike Bass intercepted a pass from Tarkenton to maintain Washington's lead going into halftime.\nThe Vikings then took the opening kickoff of the second half and marched 79 yards, including a 46-yard run by Reed, to score on fullback Bill Brown's 2-yard rushing touchdown. To make matters worse for Washington, star cornerback Pat Fischer suffered cracked ribs on the drive and was replaced by Speedy Duncan, an 11-year veteran who normally only played as a kick returner. Still, the Redskins managed to take back the lead with Knight's two third quarter field goals, first tying a playoff record from 52 yards, and the second from 46 yards on the first play of the fourth quarter.\nNow facing a 13–10 fourth quarter deficit, the Vikings stormed back with two quick touchdowns. First they drove 71 yards in 8 plays to score on Tarkenton's pass to John Gilliam, who beat single coverage by Duncan for a 28-yard touchdown catch. Then on the first play of Washington's ensuing drive, Nate Wright intercepted a pass from Kilmer and returned it 26 yards to the Redskins 8-yard line, setting up a 6-yard touchdown pass from Tarkenton to Gilliam that made the score 24–13. With 5:28 left, Washington got back to within four points, getting good field position due to Ken Stone blocking a Vikings punt and converting it into Kilmer's 28-yard touchdown pass to Roy Jefferson. But the Vikings managed to burn up 4 minutes with their ensuing drive, finishing it off with a 30-yard Cox field goal that gave them a 27–20 lead. The Redskins had less than two minutes to drive for a tying touchdown, and ended up turning the ball over on downs at the Vikings 42-yard line.\nTarkenton completed 16/28 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns, with 1 interception. Reed had 17 carries for 95 yards and caught 4 passes for 76. Brown rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 2 passes for 13 yards.\n“Sometimes they’re not concentrating on me,” said Oscar Reed, in reference to his big plays in the game. “Since early in the season they’ve been keying on Chuck Foreman. I’m not the world’s greatest pass catcher or runner, but given a little room, I’ll use what I’ve got.”\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Redskins and Vikings.\nAFC: Oakland Raiders 33, Pittsburgh Steelers 14.\nThe Raiders outgained Pittsburgh in total yards 361 to 223, forced three turnovers without losing any on their side, and scored 16 unanswered points in the second half to defeat the Steelers.\nAfter forcing the Steelers to punt on the game's opening drive, Oakland drove 82 yards in 16 plays, including a 20-yard burst by running back Marv Hubbard, to go up 7–0 on Hubbard's 1-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Pittsburgh drove into Raiders territory, only to lose the ball when Terry Bradshaw's pass was deflected by Otis Sistrunk into the arms of linebacker Phil Villapiano for an interception. A 21-yard completion from Ken Stabler to receiver Mike Siani on the ensuing drive set up a 25-yard field goal by George Blanda, increasing the Raiders lead to 10–0 with 8 minutes left in the half. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but their defense subsequently forced the Raiders to go three-and-out. Then safety Glen Edwards returned Ray Guy's 40-yard punt 20 yards to the Oakland 45-yard line. On the next play, Bradshaw completed a 24-yard pass to running back Preston Pearson. Bradshaw eventually threw an incomplete pass on third down, but a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty gave the Steelers a first down on the Oakland 7. Following a 3-yard running play, Bradshaw finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown toss to Pearson, cutting the score to 10–7 going into halftime.\nOakland dominated the second half with 16 consecutive points. After Clarence Davis returned the second half kickoff 30 yards to the Raiders 32, a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Pittsburgh and a 17-yard completion from Stabler to Hubbard led to Blanda's 31-yard field goal. The Steelers had to punt on their next drive, and George Atkinson returned the ball 13 yards to the Oakland 43, sparking a drive that ended with another Blanda field goal that gave the Raiders a 16–7 lead. Pittsburgh seemed primed to respond when Frank Lewis caught a 17-yard reception that put them in Raiders territory, but on the next play, Willie Brown intercepted a pass from Bradshaw and returned it 54 yards for a touchdown. With the Steelers now facing a 23–7 deficit, the situation continued to unravel as Bradshaw was intercepted again on the next drive, this time by Atkinson, who returned it 8 yards to the Raiders 37. Oakland running back Charlie Smith then took off on a 40-yard run to the Steelers 22, setting up Blanda's third field goal that gave them a 26–7 lead.\nWith 9:12 left in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh got one last chance to get back in the game as Bradshaw's 26-yard touchdown pass to Lewis cut the score to 26–14. But after a punt from each team, Oakland put the game away, mainly due to Hubbard, who rushed for gains of 16, 15, 9, and 2 yards before finishing the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Raiders a 33–14 lead with 14 seconds left on the clock.\nStabler completed 14/17 passes for 142 yards. Hubbard rushed for 91 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching a 17-yard pass. Smith added 73 yards rushing and 10 yards receiving. Bradshaw was held to just 12/25 completions for 167 yards, with 2 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. Future Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris was held to 29 yards on 10 carries.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Steelers and Raiders, with Pittsburgh winning last year's meeting.\nSunday, December 23, 1973.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 34, Cincinnati Bengals 16.\nThe Dolphins outgained Cincinnati in total yards, 400–194, and first downs, 27–11, while also scoring on three of their first four possessions and shutting out the Bengals in the second half. The Dolphins racked up 241 yards on the ground, including 106 from Mercury Morris and 71 from Larry Csonka, while receiver Paul Warfield caught 5 passes for 95 yards and a score.\nMiami dominated the game early on, scoring on their opening drive with Bob Griese's 13-yard touchdown pass to Warfield. Morris racked up 33 rushing yards on the way to Miami's next first quarter touchdown, a 1-yard run by Csonka. In the second quarter, faced with 3rd and 1 from his own 44, Griese completed a 48-yard bomb to Warfield that set up Morris' 4-yard touchdown run. Miami's three touchdowns came on drives of 80, 80, and 73 yards, while all Cincinnati could manage in the first 26 minutes of the contest was 24-yard field goal by Horst Muhlmann on their first drive of the game. Even that drive caused a major setback for the team, as running back Essex Johnson, the team's leading rusher during the season with 997 yards, suffered a game-ending injury after picking up 14 yards on his first carry.\nFacing the prospect of going into their locker room with a 21–3 deficit, the Bengals suddenly stormed back with 13 points in the final 3:26 of the second quarter. First, defensive back Neal Craig intercepted Griese's pass intended for Jim Mandich near the sideline and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. Then the Bengals defense forced a punt and got the ball back on their own 33 with less than two minutes left. It took nearly all of that time for the team to cross midfield, but quarterback Ken Anderson finally got them into scoring range with a 22-yard scramble to the Dolphins 38, where Muhlmann made a 46-yard field goal that cut the score to 21–13. Now with just 8 seconds left until halftime, Morris fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Bengals linebacker Jim LeClair recovered on the Dolphins 3-yard line. On the next play, Muhlmann kicked a 12-yard field goal that sent both teams into their locker rooms with a score of 21–16.\nHowever, Cincinnati's hope of a comeback was quickly crushed in the second half. On the third play of the third quarter, Anderson tried to connect on a deep pass to tight end Bob Trumpy, but it was intercepted by Dick Anderson, who returned the ball 19 yards to the Bengals 28. Seven plays later, Miami went up 28–16 with Griese's 7-yard touchdown pass to Mandich. Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian put the finishing touches on his team's victory with field goals from 50 and 46 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Bengals and Dolphins.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 27, Los Angeles Rams 16.\nThe Cowboys avenged a 37–31 regular season loss to L.A. as two Rams turnovers in the first quarter gave the Cowboys a 14–0 lead. Lee Roy Jordan's interception of a John Hadl pass on the first play of the game led to Calvin Hill's 3-yard touchdown run. Mel Renfro then recovered a Lawrence McCutcheon fumble on the L.A. 35-yard line to set up the Cowboys again which later resulted in Roger Staubach's 4-yard touchdown pass to Drew Pearson.\nIn the second quarter, Toni Fritsch then added a 39-yard field goal to increase Dallas' lead to 17–0. However, a 40-yard reception by Rams receiver Harold Jackson set up David Ray's 33-yard field goal that made the score 17–3. Ray would miss three field goals throughout the game, but made two more to cut the score to 17–9 in the fourth quarter. Then Hill lost a fumble that L.A. converted into Tony Baker's 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 17–16 with 10 minutes left in regulation.\nEver since taking their 17–0 lead in the second quarter, the Cowboys had managed just four first downs and had not crossed midfield, as Staubach faced a relentless pass rush that sacked him seven times (2½ by Jack Youngblood, 2 by Merlin Olsen). But when faced with third down and long after an Olsen sack on the ensuing drive, Staubach threw a short pass over the middle to Drew Pearson, and as the Rams were about to stop Pearson for a short gain, defensive backs Dave Elmendorf and Steve Preece collided and fell, allowing Pearson to scamper untouched for an 83-yard touchdown that effectively clinched the game. Fritsch added another field goal for the 27–16 final.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Rams and Cowboys.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, December 30, 1973.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 27, Dallas Cowboys 10.\nThe Vikings forced 4 interceptions and recovered 2 fumbles in the second half while also holding Dallas to 152 total yards en route to a 27–10 victory over the Cowboys.\nWith the loss of running back Calvin Hill and defensive tackle Bob Lilly to injuries, Dallas' offense could not get anything going. Minnesota jumped to a 10–0 lead by halftime with a Fred Cox field goal and an 86-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard rushing touchdown by Chuck Foreman. The touchdown drive included Fran Tarkenton's completions to tight end Stu Voigt for gains of 16 and 7 yards, a 2-yard run by Foreman on 4th down and 1, and a 12-yard scramble by Tarkenton himself.\nWhat followed would be an amazingly sloppy second half in which both teams combined for 10 turnovers. Three minutes into the third quarter, Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach threw an interception to Minnesota cornerback Bobby Bryant on the Vikings 2-yard line. But the Cowboys defense forced a punt and Golden Richards returned it 63 yards for a touchdown, cutting the score to 10–7. Tarkenton quickly struck back, throwing a 54-yard touchdown pass to John Gilliam, who managed to outrun single coverage by Cowboys future Hall of Fame defensive back Mel Renfro. Dallas responded with Toni Fritsch's 17-yard field goal which cut the lead to 17–10.\nThen a wave of turnovers began. On the ensuing possession, Dallas got a huge opportunity to score when Charlie Waters forced a fumble from Foreman that safety Cliff Harris recovered on the Minnesota 37. However, the Vikings took the ball right back when Staubach threw a pass that was deflected into the arms of linebacker Jeff Siemon. An even better scoring chance awaited the Cowboys at the end of the Vikings' next drive, as Tarkenton threw an interception to Waters on the Minnesota 24. But Dallas fared no better this time, losing the ball again when Jim Marshall knocked it out of Staubach's hand as he wound up for a pass, and defensive lineman Gary Larsen recovered it. The offensive futility continued with Minnesota, as their next drive ended with a fumbled handoff exchange between Tarkenton and Foreman that Dallas lineman Larry Cole recovered on the Vikings 47-yard line.\nA few plays later, Dallas faced 3rd and 3 with 9 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Staubach attempted a pass to Bob Hayes near the right sideline, but Bryant intercepted the pass and raced 63 yards for a touchdown that put the Vikings up 24–10. Then on Dallas' next drive, Staubach tried to connect with Drew Pearson, but a devastating hit by Nate Wright caused the ball to bounce off his hands and into the arms of Jeff Wright, who returned the ball 13 yards to set up Cox's 34-yard game clinching field goal.\nBoth teams combined for a net total of just 163 passing yards. Tarkenton completed only 10/21 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown with one interception, while also rushing for 16 yards. Staubach had one of the worst postseason performances of his career, completing just 10/21 passes for 89 yards and throwing 4 interceptions, though he did rush for 30 yards. Foreman was the top offensive performer of the day with 76 rushing yards and 4 receptions for 28, while fullback Oscar Reed added 18 carries for 75 yards and an 8-yard catch.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Vikings and Cowboys, with Dallas winning the only previous meeting.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 27, Oakland Raiders 10.\nMiami threw only six passes during the game, completing just 3 for 34 yards, but gained 266 rushing yards (more than Oakland's total yards for the game) on 53 carries. Fullback Larry Csonka led the Dolphins to a victory with 117 rushing yards and an AFC playoff record 3 rushing touchdowns.\nMiami scored on an opening 64-yard drive when quarterback Bob Griese's 27-yard run set up Csonka's 11-yard rushing touchdown. Csonka scored again late in the second quarter at the end of a 63-yard drive that took more than 8 minutes off the clock, finishing it with a 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 14–0 with 14 seconds left in the half.\nOakland managed to get on the board in the third quarter with a 21-yard George Blanda field goal, but this was quickly countered with a 42-yard Garo Yepremian field goal set up by Charlie Leigh's 53-yard kickoff return. Oakland then drove 78 yards and scored on Ken Stabler's 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Siani, cutting the lead to 17–10. In the fourth quarter, after Griese's 17-yard run on a QB draw set up Yepremian's 26-yard field goal, the Raiders were faced with fourth down and inches on the Dolphins 42 and were forced to \"go for it\". But running back Marv Hubbard fumbled the ball while trying to get through the line. The ball bounced into the hands of Stabler, who was tackled for a loss by defensive back Dick Anderson, and the Dolphins used their running game to take time off the clock and set up Csonka's third touchdown to clinch the game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Raiders and Dolphins, with Oakland winning the only previous meeting.\nSuper Bowl VIII: Miami Dolphins 24, Minnesota Vikings 7.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Vikings and Dolphins."

        "text": "The women's Individual Pursuit at the 2004 Summer Olympics (Cycling) was an event that consisted of matches between two cyclists. The riders would start at opposite ends of the track. They had 12 laps (3 kilometres) in which to catch the other cyclist. If neither was caught before one had gone 12 laps, the times for the distance were used to determine the victor. In the twelve matches of the 2004 event, one cyclist was lapped.\nRecords.\nUlmer held the world record coming into this event, which she set at the world championships in Melbourne in May 2004. She reduced the world record by more than 6 seconds during this event. All three of the medallists in Athens beat the previous world record.\nWR denotes world record&lt;br&gt;\nQ denotes qualification for next round\nQualifying round.\nThe riders raced against each other in matches of two. Qualification for the next round was not based on who won those matches, however. The cyclists with the eight fastest times advanced, regardless of whether they won or lost their match. This resulted in the first two heats not having any riders advance while the next four heats each had both winners and losers advance.\nFirst round.\nIn the first round of actual match competition, cyclists were seeded into matches based on their times from the qualifying round. The fastest cyclist faced the eighth-fastest, the second-fastest faced the third, and so forth. Winners advanced to the finals while losers in each match received a final ranking based on their time in the round.\nFinals.\nIn the women's individual pursuit finals, the current world champion and world record holder, Sarah Ulmer from New Zealand, set a new world record in the final for a time of 3:24.537 for the gold medal. It is the first time New Zealand has ever won a cycling gold medal. The Australian, Katie Mactier (3:27.650), set a very fast first 1000 m of 1:10.618, with a lead of one second, but Ulmer reversed this lead in the second 1000 m, and went on to win the pursuit by 3 seconds. Netherlands rider and former world champion, Leontien Ziljaard-van Moorsel rode a time of 3:27.037 for the bronze defeating Australian, Katherine Bates (3:31.715)"

        "title": "Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's sprint",
        "text": "The men's sprint at the 2004 Summer Olympics (Cycling) was an event that consisted of cyclists making three laps around the track. Only the time for the last 200 metres of the 750 metres covered was counted as official time. There were 19 competitors from 13 nations, with each nation limited to two cyclists. The event was won by Ryan Bayley of Australia, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint after three times coming in second (most recently in 1992). Theo Bos of the Netherlands took silver, the Dutch team's first medal in the event since 1936. René Wolff earned bronze, stretching Germany's podium streak to four Games (five if East Germany is included; cyclists from eastern Germany had been on the podium in the event every Games since 1976 except the boycotted 1984 Games).\nAustralian Ryan Bayley defeated current world champion, Theo Bos from the Netherlands, when the sprinting gold medal was taken to a third decider race. In the race for the bronze René Wolff from Germany defeated Laurent Gané from France.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Three of the quarterfinalists from 2000 returned: fourth-place finisher Laurent Gané of France, sixth-place finisher José Antonio Villanueva of Spain, and seventh-place finisher Sean Eadie of Australia. Three recent world champions were competing: Gané (2003, also runner-up in 2000, 2001, and 2004), Eadie (2002), and Theo Bos of the Netherlands (2004). René Wolff of Germany and Ryan Bayley of Australia were also significant contenders, each having reached the podium at world championships.\nFor the second consecutive Games, no nations made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 23rd appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches along with the new qualifying round of time trials. There were five main match rounds, with two one-round repechages.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nTimes and average speeds are listed. Q denotes qualification for the next round.\nAfter Tomohiro Nagatsuka dropped out of competition following the round, all of the cyclists following him advanced one position. This allowed Stefan Nimke to compete in the first round despite having originally placed 19th.\nRound 1.\nThe first round consisted of nine heats of two riders each. Winners advanced to the next round, losers competed in the 1/16 repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nThe nine defeated cyclists from the 1/16 round took part in the 1/16 repechage. They raced in three heats of three riders each. The winner of each heat rejoined the nine victors of the 1/16 round in advancing to the 1/8 round\n1/8 finals.\nThe 1/8 round consisted of six matches, each pitting two of the twelve remaining cyclists against each other. The winners advanced to the quarterfinals, with the losers getting another chance in the 1/8 repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nThe six cyclists defeated in the 1/8 round competed in the 1/8 repechage. Two heats of three riders were held. Winners rejoined the victors from the 1/8 round and advanced to the quarterfinals. The four other riders competed in the 9th through 12th place classification.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe eight riders that had advanced to the quarterfinals competed pairwise in four matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races. All four quarterfinals matches were decided without a third race. Winners advanced to the semifinals, losers competed in a 5th to 8th place classification.\nSemifinals.\nThe four riders that had advanced to the semifinals competed pairwise in two matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races. Both semifinals matches were decided without a third race. Winners advanced to the finals, losers competed in the bronze medal match.\nFinals.\nClassification 9-12.\nThe 9-12 classification was a single race with all four riders that had lost in the 1/8 repechage taking place. The winner of the race received 9th place, with the others taking the three following places in order.\nClassification 5-8.\nThe 5-8 classification was a single race with all four riders that had lost in the quarterfinals taking place. The winner of the race received 5th place, with the others taking the three following places in order.\nBronze medal match.\nThe bronze medal match was contested in a set of three races, with the winner of two races declared the winner. Since René Wolff won both of the first two races, the third was not run.\nFinal.\nThe final was a best-of-three match. Bos took a lead in the series when he won the first race, but Bayley defeated him in the second race. The third race was decisive and Bayley came out on top again."

        "title": "Essex County Cricket Club in 2005",
        "text": "Essex County Cricket Club played their cricket during the 2005 season in Division Two of the County Championship and Division One of the Sunday League. They started the season 8–1 to win the Second Division Title, and were second in the Championship table at 9 May, but five matches without a win following that sent them down to fifth place at the Twenty20 break in June. They only intermittently broke into the top three after the Twenty20 break, and when they did their opponents behind them usually had a game in hand. They finished fifth, 15.5 points behind the promotion spot, and with 36 bowling points they picked up the fewest in the entire Division Two. In the National League, however, they only lost once in sixteen games – against Gloucestershire Gladiators in August – and won the League on 28 August with three games to play. In the C&amp;G Trophy, they went out to Lancashire at the second round stage, while they finished fifth in the group stage of the Twenty20 Cup, two points off a guaranteed quarter-final spot.\nEssex played 17 first-class games in 2005, winning six, drawing seven and losing four. They also played 18 List A games, winning 14, losing two and having two no-results, and in eight Twenty20 games they won three, lost three and had two no-results.\nMatch details.\nApril.\nTheir first first-class game of the season was a four wicket win against Cambridge UCCE, as a warm-up before their first County Championship game against Yorkshire, which was drawn after rain fell on all four days. Then there was a rain-affected win in the Sunday League against Hampshire and a mid-week game against Glamorgan, which was abandoned as a \"no result\" without a ball being bowled. Essex then beat Somerset by nine wickets in the Championship, chasing 77 to win to go second in the Division Two table, seven points behind Durham.\nMCC University Match: Cambridge UCCE v Essex (9–11 April).\nEssex beat Cambridge UCCE by 4 wickets\nCambridge UCCE and Essex started the season at Fenner's Ground in Cambridge. For the first time the Cambridge UCCE team was dominated by players from Anglia Polytechnic University rather than Cambridge University. Cambridge UCCE batted first and completed an innings of 321 on the first day, after being seven down for 139. Matthew Friedlander, who has represented Boland in South Africa, made 81, getting together with Wright, who made 76 to help the students past 300. James Middlebrook took 5 for 54 for Essex. On the second day, Essex put together 307 for 4 declared, although no player scored more than Ravinder Bopara, with 69. Cambridge UCCE scored 64 for 3 by close of play. On the third and final day, Cambridge UCCE piled on more runs, finally declaring on 255 for 4, the top-score of which being 129 not out from Adnan Akram.\nThis left Essex 270 to win. They lost wickets in doing so, with Palladino (who would later this season go on to play for Essex) taking four wickets, and the students gamely going for a win. However, an all-round performance by Essex finally saw them home with four wickets left. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Essex v Yorkshire (13–16 April).\nEssex (12pts) drew with Yorkshire (5.5pts)\nAt Chelmsford, Yorkshire won the toss and put Essex in to bat. Essex lost two of ten wickets on the first day, as Will Jefferson, Essex' 6'10\" opener put on 149 before being out leg before just before the end of the first day's play. Essex captain, Ronnie Irani, said, \"People think his height is a weakness, they try and over-test it – they try and pitch it up too much or bowl short too much.\" Jefferson could have been run out for 0 after a mix-up with Cook – who fell early for 11 – and was dropped on 6. However, Jefferson was given support by Zimbabwean Grant Flower, who was 55 not out at close, with Essex on 224 for 2, after 26 overs were lost to rain. Seven Yorkshire bowlers were used, but few had any success, and England bowler Matthew Hoggard went wicketless on the first day.\nA total of 47 overs were possible in the next two days, as Essex moved on to 394 for 4 – losing two men to Hoggard. Andy Flower, Grant's brother, and Ronnie Irani were on unbeaten half-centuries at the close of the third day's play, a draw a virtual certainty.\nAfter adding 7 in 11 balls on the fourth and final day, Essex declared on 401 for 4, batting on to score the extra bonus point before putting Yorkshire in. Whilst Yorkshire's captain, Craig White, resisted with 59 not out, the team were bowled out for 205, 196 behind. Essex enforced the follow-on, but as rain affected play and cutting down the length of their innings, Yorkshire held on. Jaques scored 67 not out from 88 balls out of his team's 105 for 2, as Yorkshire escaped with the draw, but were fined 0.5 points for a slow over rate during Essex' innings. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNational League: Hampshire v Essex (17 April).\nEssex (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 16 runs (D/L method)\nAt the Rose Bowl, Hampshire Hawks batted first, scoring 175 for 9, as Tim Phillips took 3 for 31. It was a good day for spin, with Grant Flower also taking 2 wickets. In reply, Essex Eagles' Will Jefferson was 44 not out, and Essex 69 for 2 off 16 overs when rain put an end to play, leaving Essex the winners on the Duckworth–Lewis method. England's star one-day player of the winter, Kevin Pietersen, managed only 5 off 14 balls for Hampshire before being bowled. (BBC scorecard)\nNational League: Glamorgan v Essex (22 April).\nMatch abandoned – Glamorgan (2pts), Essex (2pts)\nThis match, which was scheduled to be played at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff was abandoned without a ball being bowled. It was the first time for almost eight years a one-day league match at Cardiff has ended as a no-result. (BBC scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Somerset v Essex (27–30 April).\nEssex (22pts) beat Somerset (2pts) by nine wickets\nOn 35 overs were possible on the first day. On a green Taunton pitch, Somerset fared poorly against Essex's seam attack. Alex Tudor, who had moved from Surrey, took the first two wickets, including Marcus Trescothick for 4. Somerset were on 119 for 5 at stumps.\nSomerset were soon dismissed on the Thursday for 190. Essex's youngsters, Alastair Cook, who looked to be headed for an England call-up before long, and Ravinder Bopara, aged 20 and 19 respectively, made merry with the bat. Although the pitch did not seam as much as the first day, they put on 181 together. Cook was finally out bowled for 111, and Bopara not out for 71 at close, with Essex on 224 for 3, 34 runs ahead.\nBopara could not add to his overnight total on the third day, as he was caught off Richard Johnson's bowling. But Essex were able to take control, finally declaring on 427 for 8 when Tudor was run out for 57. Somerset's fast bowlers, Johnson and Andrew Caddick had picked up three wickets each, but had not been able to stop the flow of runs. Foster was not out on 78 when the declaration came. In reply, Somerset fared okay till Trescothick went with the score on 57, and then, at 65 for 1, Andre Adams, Essex's New Zealand import took a hat-trick. Mike Burns edged an outswinger, and Sanath Jayasuriya and James Hildreth were both leg before. With Adams picking up one more wicket before the close of play, Somerset finished on 128 for 5, still 109 runs off making Essex bat again.\nOn the Saturday, Somerset's tail was quickly reduced to 180 for 8. There was then something of a rearguard action with 63 put on by Caddick and Robert Turner for the ninth wicket, and Turner and Nixon McLean putting on 70 for the tenth. This left Essex with a target of 77 to win, which they did easily with the loss of just one wicket. (BBC scorecard)\nMay.\nMay began with wins over Devon (in the C&amp;G Trophy) and Leicestershire in the Championship, before they played out a draw against Northamptonshire despite trailing by 374 runs on first innings, as they batted out the remainder of the match to make 495 for 6. Following that, a League game against Glamorgan was won by five wickets. On 17 May they were eliminated from the C&amp;G Trophy at the second round stage at Old Trafford. Two Championship matches followed, a defeat against Worcestershire which saw them go out of the promotion zone and a draw with Yorkshire, which left them third in the table behind Durham and Yorkshire at the end of May, though with Worcestershire trailing four points behind with a game in hand.\nC&amp;G Trophy Round One: Devon v Essex (3–4 May).\nEssex beat Devon by 180 runs to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nNo play was possible on the originally scheduled day of play at Exmouth because of rain, and the reserve day had to be used. When play started on what was a wettish pitch with a slow outfield Essex hit over the top and ended on 264 for 5 off their 50 overs, with Andy Flower and Ravinder Bopara recording half-centuries. Devon were bowled out for just under a third of that score, making 84, although that could be seen as a recovery from 23 for 6 – a position they were in thanks to Essex pacers Andre Adams and Darren Gough, who shared three wickets each with the new ball. Devon's Neil Hancock, who turned out in two Twenty20 games and one National League match for Somerset in 2004, top scored with 40 despite batting at seven. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Essex v Leicestershire (6–9 May).\nEssex (21pts) beat Leicestershire (3.5pts) by six wickets\nIn a relatively closely fought game at Chelmsford, the Essex team showed more resilience than the visitors, as all the Essex players contributed with either 25 runs, five wickets or five catches. It started with a good bowling effort on the first day after Ronnie Irani had chosen to put Leicestershire in. Darren Robinson and Darren Maddy then put on 98 as Essex failed to get a wicket in the first hour and a half, but the part-time medium pace of Essex number three Ravinder Bopara got Maddy out, and four middle-order batsmen were dismissed in single figures as Leicestershire lost eight wickets for 69. David Masters (27) and Phil DeFreitas (20) added 49 for the ninth wicket to take Leicestershire to a final total of 220 in 81 overs. Dale Steyn, the young South African pace bowler with three Test caps, took three for 69 on Essex debut, but Darren Gough got the best figures with three for 46 – including Robinson, Paul Nixon for a golden duck and DeFreitas.\nEvery Essex batsman except number 11 Steyn (run out for 0) scored in double figures, and William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 as Essex got into a relatively comfortable lead of 142, despite three wickets from DeFreitas and Ottis Gibson. Leicestershire surpassed their first innings score with five wickets in hand the second time around, though, before Gough and Napier dug out two wickets to have them 228 for 7. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman had all passed 30, and Claude Henderson paired up with Ackerman to add 96 for the eighth wicket – the second-highest partnership of the match, as Leicestershire made their way to a lead of 190. Gough was the only bowler to take more than two wickets, ending with four for 60, while Steyn conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Gibson.\nEssex had the entire fourth day to secure their victory, though they only spent half of it. Their 191 runs were up inside 44.2 overs, England A left-hander Alastair Cook the fastest scorer with 59 off 69 balls while Zimbabwean keeper Andy Flower finished with 74 not out to lead Essex to their target. Leicestershire were trying to slow the chase down by bowling few overs, and were deducted half a point for the slow over rate.(Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Northamptonshire v Essex (11–14 May).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Essex (6pts)\nAt Northampton the home side batted first. Bilal Shafayat (153) and Usman Afzaal (168) scored centuries to help Northamptonshire to 552 for 7 declared. When Essex finally got to bat after nearly nine hours in the field, Johann Louw took 6 for 51, as Essex lost their last seven wickets for 44. Three batsmen were dismissed for ducks by Louw, and another for three, as Essex made a total of 178. The follow-on was enforced, and Essex batted for nearly eleven hours to draw the game. Alastair Cook made a career-best 195 in 513 minutes, supported by Zimbabwean Andy Flower, who made 142 not out, as Essex made it to the draw by making 495 for 6 declared. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNational League: Essex v Glamorgan (15 May).\nEssex (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by five wickets\nEssex Eagles continued their unbeaten run in all cricket this season, after getting the 185 runs they needed for the last six wickets against Glamorgan Dragons at Chelmsford. Essex won the toss and chose to field first, and Glamorgan made 216 for 7. James Middlebrook was the main contributor with the ball, taking two for 27 off 9 overs, but South African pace bowler Dale Steyn also contributed with three for 34 amid no-balls and wides. Andrew Davies and David Harrison then reduced Essex to 31 for 4 before Ravinder Bopara (96 not out) and, once again, Middlebrook (46) took centre stage. With a partnership of 122, the two cut nearly two-thirds off the target, and wicket-keeper James Foster contributed with 38 off 30 balls to see Essex to the target with five wickets and sixteen balls to spare.\nC&amp;G Trophy Round Two: Lancashire v Essex (17 May).\nLancashire beat Essex by 6 wickets to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nAndrew Flintoff took four for 26 and the other five bowlers dug out a wicket each, as Essex made 195 for 9 en route to their first of two one-day defeats in the 2005 season, Ravinder Bopara top-scoring with 42 off 83 balls. In reply, Lancashire's opening partnership of Mal Loye and Stuart Law put on 53 in 10.1 overs at Old Trafford, before Alex Tudor dismissed them both. Brad Hodge, however, kept the run rate up by scoring at nearly five an over, well ahead of the required four. Hodge was dropped on 32, and Lancashire might have been put under pressure if it had been taken, but instead he went on to make 82 off 102 balls before he was caught behind off Tim Phillips, as Lancashire made their target with 6 wickets and 6 overs to spare. (Inningsbreak scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Essex v Worcestershire (20–23 May).\nWorcestershire (21pts) beat Essex (4pts) by eight wickets\nEssex and Worcestershire scored runs at a rate of nearly four an over in the match at Chelmsford, and thus the match ended in a result despite some 40 overs being lost to rain. Ronnie Irani, with 85, was the only one to pass 40 for Essex, while Matthew Mason and Gareth Batty took wickets amid showers on the first day. Essex totalled 220 in their first innings, Mason taking four for 48, Batty three for 26, and Sri Lankan overseas player Chaminda Vaas going wicketless. In reply, Ben Smith made a century including fourteen fours, and with help of Gareth Batty (54) and Kabir Ali (53), both former England players, Worcestershire got to 383 all out – a lead of 163. Alastair Cook, Essex' 20-year-old prodigy, made a quick 46 in reply, but it was their 37-year-old Zimbabwean Andy Flower who was the top scorer, lasting three and a half hours at the crease and pairing up with five different batsmen for his 85 – which led them to 329.\nSetting Worcestershire 167 to win, Essex got two wickets before the close of play on day three, removing opener Stephen Peters for 0 and nightwatchman and wicketkeeper Jamie Pipe for 11, caught off Darren Gough and Dale Steyn respectively. On the fourth day, however, Stephen Moore built on his good batting form after 246 against Derbyshire a week before, however, making 63 not out and adding 146 up with Graeme Hick (76 not out) to secure an eight-wicket win and go past Essex in the table.\nCounty Championship: Yorkshire v Essex (25–28 May).\nEssex (12pts) drew with Yorkshire (9pts)\nCenturies from Andy Flower (188) and Ronnie Irani (103) along with 93 from the former Yorkshire player Darren Gough helped Essex to a total of 622 for 8 declared at Headingley. The total was Essex' highest in the 2005 season. Essex were 76 for 4 after two wickets from Deon Kruis, but after that Yorkshire's bowlers conceded 136.5 runs for every wicket, and the partnerships for the fifth to eighth wicket were all worth more than 100 runs for Essex. The highest stand was between Andy Flower and Irani, who added 213 for the fifth wicket.\nNew Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams then took two early wickets to dig into the Yorkshire effort, and they finished the second day on 53 for 2. The third day saw runs hit at a rate just below three an over by Yorkshire, as only Gough could take more than one wicket – ending with five for 85. Yorkshire saw out the day to end on 336 for 8, meaning that Essex would have to take twelve wickets on the final day to win the game. They only dug out seven – Tim Bresnan, Chris Silverwood and Deon Kruis frustrating them to build a further 72 runs overnight in the first innings, and following on Yorkshire withstood the spin of James Middlebrook who had to bowl 29 of 68 Essex overs. Yorkshire made their way to 238 for 5 with Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath making half-centuries, after an opening stand of 94.\nNational League: Nottinghamshire v Essex (30 May).\nEssex (4pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by six wickets\nFormer England international Darren Gough took four wickets for 16 runs, including both opening batsmen, as Essex Eagles took a six-wicket win at Trent Bridge over Nottinghamshire Outlaws to keep their unbeaten record going and to go second in the table. Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 154 as Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook helped out Gough, taking two for 27 including the wicket of top-scorer David Hussey. Essex' batsmen all got past 20 in the chase – excluding Ravinder Bopara who made a duck – and captain Ronnie Irani, opening the batting, guided Essex to 94 for 2 with a run-a-ball 53. Andy Flower then took Essex to the target after putting on 50 with brother Grant.\nJune.\nJune started with a draw in the Championship against Derbyshire, before taking a last-wicket National League win against Middlesex at Lord's to go top of the National League. Four days later, they travelled to the Riverside Ground to take on Durham in a top-of-the-table battle in the Championship, but Essex lost by an innings and 19 runs inside three days to fall to fourth. However, they recorded National League wins over Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, to take a four-point lead in the National League before the Twenty20 break.\nCounty Championship: Essex v Derbyshire (1–4 June).\nDerbyshire (11pts) drew with Essex (9pts)\nDerbyshire batted first at Chelmsford, and they put on 462 with Steve Stubbings making 92 and Graeme Welch 112. Essex lost quick wickets in reply, going to 34 for 4, but then Ronnie Irani, James Foster and James Middlebrook all made half-centuries as the hosts made 320. Derbyshire, who were without a win all season, declared at lunchtime on the fourth day, at 236 for 3 from 63 overs, with Michael Di Venuto making 110. A half-century from Alastair Cook and a maiden first-class century from Ravinder Bopara saw Essex through to the draw on 245 for 5, well short of their theoretical target of 379. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNational League: Middlesex v Essex (5 June).\nEssex (4pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by one wicket\nEssex Eagles won the top of the table clash in the National League against Middlesex Crusaders at Lord's, after hitting 50 runs for the last two wickets to seal victory. Middlesex' innings opened with a 101-run partnership from Paul Weekes and Ed Smith, lasting nearly an hour and a half, as the pair scored at about four an over. A burst of wickets followed, which reduced Middlesex to 144 for 5, but a display of aggressive hitting from Scott Styris – who scored 71 from 43 balls, including seven sixes – took the target up to 244. In reply, Essex scored runs to be on a par with the required rate, but lost wickets, Irfan Pathan grabbing two and the others helping out as Essex lost their first seven for 182, and Ryan ten Doeschate and former England all-rounder Alex Tudor were at the crease. Tudor went quickly, as did No. 10 Andre Adams, and Essex required 26 for the last wicket. But ten Doeschate, who had earlier been taken for 25 runs in his only over, now made up for it by hitting eight boundaries as the Dutch-South African recorded a career highest score of 51 not out off 41 balls, taking Essex to the target with three balls and a wicket to spare. His batting partner, Darren Gough, contributed with four runs in the seven-minute last-wicket stand worth 26.\nCounty Championship: Durham v Essex (9–11 June).\nDurham (22pts) beat Essex (3pts) by an innings and 19 runs\nDurham continued their run of unbeaten matches in the 2005 season by defeating Essex in just three days at Chester-le-Street. Durham batted first, and made a total of 505 in the first innings, with Gordon Muchall and stand-in captain Dale Benkenstein both making centuries and ten batsmen made it into double figures. The Durham bowlers then backed up the batsmen's efforts by seeing off the Essex batsmen in just 55 overs to leave them all out for 106, Ashley Noffke and Mark Davies taking four wickets each. Essex followed on 399 behind, and were 140 for 6 after three wickets from Davies, despite nightwatchman Dale Steyn making 82. However, number nine Andre Adams made 103, James Foster added 78, and Essex made it to 366 for 7 – before Davies grabbed two wickets, and Neil Killeen dismissed Foster to give Durham an innings win despite lacking internationals Paul Collingwood, Steve Harmison and Mike Hussey. They did have New Zealand international Nathan Astle in the side – he contributed with 15 runs and no wicket for 24. (BBC scorecard)\nNational League: Essex v Gloucestershire (17 June).\nEssex (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 55 runs\nAndy Flower took the Gloucestershire Gladiators' bowlers for 127 runs in 93 balls at The County Ground in Chelmsford as he and Ronnie Irani paired up for 139 to send Essex Eagles to a final score of 271 for 7. Upul Chandana got the most expensive figures, with 64 runs off nine overs, but James Averis also conceded six an over – and unlike Chandana, he did not take a wicket. In reply, Alex Tudor snared out a couple of wickets in the first 20 minutes, and Gloucestershire lost nine men for 182 after three wickets from Pakistani spinner Danish Kaneria. Even a hit-out from Chandana – who scored 32 off 30 balls, his highest score in six innings in 2005 – was not enough to take a win from the Eagles, their fifth of the season. Essex thus went top of the National League table along with Middlesex.\nNational League: Worcestershire v Essex (19 June).\nEssex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 39 runs\nIn these teams' last match before the Twenty20 season started, played at New Road in Worcester, Essex Eagles prevailed to take a four-point lead into the month-long break as their bowlers took out Worcestershire for 164 to defend a total of 203 for 9. Having won the toss, skipper Ronnie Irani was the first victim of the Worcestershire Royals bowling, as he departed for a three-ball duck in the third over. Chaminda Vaas and Ray Price got two wickets each as Essex' batting made it to 167 for 8, but Ryan ten Doeschate took them past 200 with a 38-ball 34. Worcestershire started with a 66-run opening stand between Graeme Hick and Stephen Moore, but part-timer William Jefferson removed both of them in quick succession. Jefferson ended with the bowling analysis of 4–0–9–2, in his only bowling effort of the season, as Worcestershire put on 98 for the last nine wickets – 40 short of the required runs to win. Stephen Peters made 41 not out from number six, but after Moore and Hick he was the only batsman to pass 20, as James Middlebrook grabbed three wickets and Andre Adams and Ravinder Bopara two each.\nTwenty20 Cup Group Stage.\nEssex began their Twenty20 Cup with a loss against Sussex Sharks, but came back to beat Kent Spitfires and the Sharks in their two next matches. Rainy weather in the South Division resulted in two abandoned matches, meaning that five teams were challenging for two or three play-off places, and Essex were one of them, as they were third with a game to play after beating Surrey in a five-over match at Chelmsford by a solitary run. Their last match was against the Spitfires, who were yet to win in seven Twenty20 matches this season, but Kent came up trumps as they won by five runs, sending Essex into fifth place in the group and out of the quarter-finals.\nSussex v Essex (22 June).\nSussex (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by nine wickets\nEssex Eagles lost their last nine wickets for 54 runs, and the target of 110 was not enough to win their first match of the 2005 Twenty20 Cup to Sussex Sharks. Winning the toss and batting, Essex made their way to 55 for 1 in the sixth over, as Ronnie Irani hit 34 off 18 balls. But the dismissal of Irani and then James Middlebrook for 29 set them back to 73 for 3, before Andy Flower was run out. Grant Flower put on 14 with Ryan ten Doeschate, before Mushtaq Ahmed ended their innings with five for 11 from 21 deliveries – as Essex posted an all-out total of 109, losing their last six wickets for 11. Sussex scored at a rate around 7.5 runs an over, with Matt Prior scoring an unbeaten 66 off 50 balls, and 14 extras helped the Sharks past the target after 14.4 overs. Andre Adams was the only Essex bowler to take a wicket, dismissing Ian Ward in the third over.\nEssex v Kent (24 June).\nEssex (2pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 29 runs\nThe match at Chelmsford was shortened by the English rain, as both sides were limited to 12 overs. Andy Flower made 46 off 29 balls, and 17 extras boosted the Essex Eagles run-rate to exactly eleven an over. Defending 133, Essex got off to a good start as Tony Palladino took two wickets in the second over, Matthew Walker and Justin Kemp scored at 7.5 an over – well below the required 11 – and though Essex conceded nine extras, Kent Spitfires finished on 103 for 4, thirty runs short of their winning target.\nEssex v Sussex (26 June).\nEssex (2pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 43 runs\nAfter Sussex bowler Johannes van der Wath had taken two wickets inside seven minutes and sent Essex Eagles to six for two at Chelmsford, Andy Flower (59) and Ryan ten Doeschate (42 not out from number six) rebuilt to send the hosts to 151 for 5 after their 20 overs. Sussex lost two wickets in the first two overs, falling to seven for two, and though Chris Adams made 44, only one batsman passed 20 as Grant Flower took three wickets for a single run, and James Middlebrook (two for 16) and Andre Adams (two for 12) took the final wickets as Sussex were bowled out for 108.\nHampshire v Essex (28 June).\nMatch abandoned; Hampshire (1pt), Essex (1pt)\nHampshire Hawks and Essex Eagles shared the spoils as the match at The Rose Bowl, Southampton never got underway.\nEssex v Hampshire (29 June).\nNo result; Essex (1pt), Hampshire (1pt)\nHampshire Hawks and Essex Eagles played out their second no-result in their two days, after the Hawks batted to a total of 151 for 9 in their 20 overs, with Greg Lamb making 67. However, the Essex innings never got off, due to rain.\nMiddlesex v Essex (1 July).\nMiddlesex (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by 31 runs\nMiddlesex Crusaders defeated Essex Eagles despite missing Irish batsman Ed Joyce, who had gone off to play in the 2005 ICC Trophy. The opening partnership between Owais Shah and Ed Smith yielded 100 runs, Shah eventually making 79, and despite three wickets from Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook, Middlesex finished on 185 for 6 as Irfan Pathan hit two sixes to end with 21. Pathan then took three wickets inside 20 minutes, those of Alistair Cook, Ronnie Irani and Ravinder Bopara, and Essex were 45 for 5. James Foster made 62 not out at just the rate required to win, but Andre Adams could only hit at 7.5 an over as Essex finished on 154 for 7, 32 short of victory. Pathan had Adams caught near the end to finish with four for 27.\nEssex v Surrey (5 July).\nEssex (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by one run\nRain ravaged The County Ground, Chelmsford and delayed the match between Essex Eagles and Surrey Lions to after ten o'clock. When it finally began, it had been shortened to five overs a side, and Essex made runs at a run rate above 14, totalling 71 for 3 – Ronnie Irani making 32, while Azhar Mahmood took two wickets for three runs in his only ver for Surrey. In reply, Tony Palladino took two wickets for Essex, but Surrey needed eight off five after James Middlebrook bowled a wide that went for four – however, he only conceded six runs from the remaining balls of the game, and Surrey finished on 70 for 2. Yet, they would have to be exceedingly unlucky in their last game to be eliminated, as they led the group two points ahead of number three, Essex.\nKent v Essex (6 July).\nKent (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by five runs\nDane Amjad Khan, who missed the 2005 ICC Trophy and most of the Twenty20 Cup due to injury, returned to cricket with a spell of three for 24 to set Essex Eagles back to 26 for 3. Before that, Khan's Kent Spitfires had batted first, setting a target of 155 to win after left-hander Michael Carberry hit 59 not out, while Essex' New Zealand bowler Andre Adams took two for 12 off three overs. However, the Spitfires kept taking wickets, grabbing seven as Essex' innings stopped on 149 – Mark Pettini making 60 in a losing cause before he was run out, while Andrew Hall joined in with Khan as he grabbed two for 30 for Kent.\nJuly.\nComing back after the Twenty20 knock-out, Essex continued their run of unbeaten games in the National League. Topping the league before the interval, Essex continued with victories over Northamptonshire and Lancashire to open up an eight-point gap at the top of the table, being undefeated after nine of sixteen games. To add to that, they beat Northamptonshire by ten wickets in the County Championship, ensuring they were still only three points off the third and last promotion spot.\nAfter their one-day win over Lancashire, they stayed in the North, drawing their County Championship match with the Lancastrians, and then travelled to Grace Road to draw a match with Leicestershire – their sixth draw of the season, which left them three points adrift of the promotion places at the end of July, having played a game more than the third-placed Lancashire side.\nNational League: Essex v Northamptonshire (8 July).\nEssex (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nEssex Eagles recorded their seventh win in eight attempts in the National League, cementing their place at the top. After Northamptonshire Steelbacks won the toss and batted at Chelmsford, three run-outs and Grant Flower's bowling, which yielded three for 21, saw them go from 185 for 5 to 200 all out. Essex's reply saw Flower hit 90 not out after Essex had been 95 for 4, and as Dutch-South African Ryan ten Doeschate hit 29 not out Essex went past the target with ten balls to spare.\nCounty Championship: Essex v Northamptonshire (10–13 July).\nEssex (22pts) beat Northamptonshire (3pts) by ten wickets\nEssex won the match at Chelmsford, where spinners took 24 of the 30 wickets to fall. Batting first, Essex made 506 against Northamptonshire, despite Monty Panesar taking a career best seven-wicket-haul in the innings, but conceded 181 runs in the process from 56.3 overs. The Northamptonshire reply was stifled by four wickets from James Middlebrook, as they lost their first six wickets for 141, but Ben Phillips and Damien Wright added 95 for the seventh wicket before Tony Palladino grabbed three wickets in four balls, and they finished on 247.\nFollowing on 259 behind, Northamptonshire had made 203 for 2 when Essex' captain Ronnie Irani brought Alastair Cook on as his seventh bowler. The off-spinner, normally an opening batsmen, claimed his first first-class wicket by dismissing Usman Afzaal lbw for 47, and also got Bilal Shafayat and Riki Wessels out as three Northamptonshire wickets fell for five runs, and Danish Kaneria wrapped up the rest of Northamptonshire's batsmen, ending with six for 74 as Northants bowed out for 261. Chasing a target of 3, William Jefferson hit a four with the second ball of Essex' innings, thus ending the game.\nNational League: Lancashire v Essex (19 July).\nEssex (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by eight wickets (D/L method)\nIn cloudy conditions at Old Trafford, Essex Eagles grabbed eight Lancashire Lightning wickets and limited seven batsmen to sub-15 scores in a match shortened to 40 overs a side. Only Iain Sutcliffe and Mark Chilton passed 15 for Lancashire, while spinners Danish Kaneria and James Middlebrook shared five wickets between them. Lancashire eventually finished on 154 for 8, and Essex were set 156 to win due to a small rain-interruption in Lancashire's innings. Despite two wickets from James Anderson, Essex made it to the target with more than seven overs to spare, Grant Flower making 66 and Ravinder Bopara an unbeaten 45.\nCounty Championship: Lancashire v Essex (21–24 July).\nLancashire (10pts) drew with Essex (9pts)\nEssex batted through five sessions to make 536 for 9 declared at Old Trafford. Grant Flower made 115 before being caught behind off Gary Keedy, while his brother Andy made 138. Australian Andrew Crook got the best figures for Lancashire, three for 71 with his part-time off-spin, but also conceded runs at 7.1 an over – more than any other Lancs bowler. When Lancashire batted, their number three Mal Loye replied with 194 after Andre Adams had the hosts' captain Mark Chilton caught behind for 4. Loye spent 200 balls for his century at the crease and eventually ended up with an innings lasting 460 minutes before he was caught by Alastair Cook off Grant Flower, six runs short of what could have been his second double century in July 2005. After Loye's efforts, Lancashire batted 220.3 overs – Danish Kaneria bowling 70.2 of those without a single wicket – to make 655 for 6 before the captains agreed to a draw. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Leicestershire v Essex (26–29 July).\nLeicestershire (11pts) drew with Essex (8pts)\nRonnie Irani and Alastair Cook, who both made fifties, lifted Essex to 297 after being put in to bat at Grace Road. David Masters was Leicestershire's best bowler, with four for 65, and he bowled eleven maidens in 25 overs. However, Masters and the rest of the Leicestershire middle order showed precariously little resistance with the bat, as Darren Gough took two quick wickets before stumps on day 1 and Tony Palladino joined in with two more as Leicestershire imploded to 20 for 4. John Maunders and Aftab Habib lifted Leicestershire to a more respectable score, but they were still 132 for 6 at close on day 2, with half the second day's play lost due to rain. The third day was rained off, and on the fourth day Habib went on to make an unbeaten 153, Leicestershire declared on 382 for 8, and the match ended in a draw as Essex easily survived 29 overs to make 80 for 2.\nAugust.\nAugust began with a win over Championship leaders Durham at their secondary home ground in Southend, as Essex took third place in the table and closed the gap to 22 points. Middlesex visited Southend the following day, and Essex won a closely fought game by two runs to take an eight-point lead over second-placed Middlesex with two games in hand – with 16 points to number three and six games to play. The next week-end, they suffered a 60-run loss to Gloucestershire after they were bowled out for 122, but as Middlesex also lost to Northamptonshire the next week-end, Essex went closer to the title. A midweek Championship match saw the team go down to a 120-run first innings deficit against Derbyshire in Derby, but they still won the match, sending them into second place in the Division Two table. A no-result in the National League extended their lead to ten points with four games remaining, before they declared twice in a rain-hit match with Somerset and lost by five wickets. The next day – the last Sunday in August – they won the National League win over Hampshire Hawks to take their first major trophy since winning the Natwest Trophy in 1997.\nCounty Championship: Essex v Durham (3–6 August).\nEssex (18pts) beat Durham (3pts) by two wickets\nDurham won the toss at Southend-on-Sea, and their first innings lasted two sessions for 196, New Zealander Andre Adams taking five for 60 while Danish Kaneria took three for 30 for Essex. Essex also lost five wickets on the first day, to trail by 89, and as Tony Palladino and James Middlebrook were dismissed in quick succession Durham were 62 behind with three wickets in hand, with Australian Michael Lewis having taken four for 69. However, opener Alastair Cook was still there, and he was eventually last out after batting for four and a half hours, crafting 107 as Essex made it to 245 and a lead of 49. Adams dug out both openers when Durham returned to bat, but four partnerships of more than 40 – the highest between Dale Benkenstein and Gareth Breese, who added 92 – saw Durham to a first-innings total of 347, as captain Benkenstein top-scored with 124.\nEssex needed 299 to win, and had four sessions to do it. They lost Ravinder Bopara after 12 minutes, caught off Liam Plunkett, but Andy Flower and Alastair Cook forged a 72-run partnership before Durham medium-pacer Mark Davies struck and had Cook caught behind. At stumps on day three, Essex were 129 for 2. Lewis and Gareth Breese did a lot of bowling for Durham on the fourth day, totalling 65.1 of Durham's total of 100.1 overs, and after Ronnie Irani departed for 48, Durham limited the Essex partnerships to no more than 25. Andy Flower stood tall, however, spending six and a half hours at the crease to end with 132 not out – and his eighth-wicket partnership of 25 saw Essex cut the target to 10. Palladino hung in there with Flower, contributing a single, and Essex won by two wickets.\nNational League: Essex v Middlesex (7 August).\nEssex (4pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by four runs\nEssex Eagles extended their lead in the National League to eight points with a win over Middlesex Crusaders. Batting first, they had been worried by the opponents' captain Ben Hutton, who took three for 42, including top-scorer Ronnie Irani, as Essex were 118 for 6 at one point. The Dutch international Ryan ten Doeschate made 44 off 37 balls, with four fours, and played a major part in getting the Essex total to 202 for 8. Middlesex' top-order were taken out by Essex' bowlers, as only Paul Weekes passed 20 from the top seven, while Ed Smith and Ed Joyce both recorded ducks. At 102 for 6, and with skipper Hutton gone for 2, Middlesex still needed 101 runs with only four wickets in hand, but a patient 71-run partnership between Weekes and Ben Scott left Middlesex to hit 31 runs for the last three wickets when Weekes was lbw to Danish Kaneria. Scott hogged the strike, but could not get the necessary boundaries, and Middlesex finished their 45 overs on 198 for 9, five runs short of a victory that would have put them level on points with Essex.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Essex (14 August).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Essex (0pts) by 60 runs\nEssex Eagles fell to 122 all out in chase of 183 to win, losing their first game of the season, while Gloucestershire Gladiators recorded their fourth victory in eleven games to take them out of the relegation zone. Batting first, Gloucestershire were bowled out for 182 in 44.1 of the 45 overs, Matt Windows top-scoring with 57 while Darren Gough and Grant Flower took three wickets each. Malinga Bandara and Martyn Ball shared the highest partnership of the match, adding 59 runs for the ninth wicket to carry Gloucestershire from 118 for 8. Essex then lost their first seven wickets for 49 runs, James Averis finishing with figures of 8–2–9–2, while Ball and Mark Alleyne also grabbed two wickets each. Despite 46 from New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams, Essex ended all out for 122 when Adams was caught off the bowling of Mark Hardinges.\nCounty Championship: Derbyshire v Essex (16–19 August).\nEssex (19pts) beat Derbyshire (6pts) by five wickets\nEssex came back from a 120-run first innings deficit, after Derbyshire had used a day and a half for their first innings at The County Ground, Derby. Derbyshire struck runs at a rate of 2.75 an over, but four batsmen still made fifties, and especially Luke Sutton took his time at the crease. His 88 took five hours, and he faced 241 deliveries. However, Derbyshire's tactic of attrition seemed to work – after making 426, all while Danish Kaneria was bowling (the Pakistani leg spinner bowled 60.1 overs, taking six for 111), Derbyshire immediately got breakthroughs with the ball. Essex were 18 for 3 before the Flower brothers – Grant and Andy – put on 60 for the fourth wicket to help close the gap. By stumps, Essex were 113 for 4 from 50 overs.\nAfter run rates of just above 2.5 on the first two days, the third day gave the spectators nearly 400 runs while eighteen wickets fell. Graeme Welch took two wickets in consecutive deliveries in the early stages, as Essex were 128 for 6, but Ronnie Irani made a four-hour 99 and also had support from James Middlebrook (42) and Darren Gough – the latter registering 51 off just 38 deliveries. Welch finished with figures of five for 68, his second five-for of the season, as Essex finished on 306. Then, Essex' bowlers got wickets at a much more rapid rate than in the first innings, where Derbyshire had made 206 for the first four. In the second, they managed 34, as Ravinder Bopara got two wickets and Danish and Graham Napier dug out one each. Another three-hour effort from Luke Sutton and a 91-ball 74 from Jonathan Moss saw Derbyshire to stumps with a lead of 314 with eight down – Sutton still not out with 38. A further 22 runs were added on the second day, while Danish dismissed Jake Needham to complete his second five-for of the match – Sutton was left stranded on 46 not out, setting Essex 337 to win. As Alastair Cook (14), Grant Flower (11-ball duck) and Bopara (10) were dismissed in succession, Essex lost their first three wickets for 82, but William Jefferson made 83 to set them back on track, and a 177-run partnership between Andy Flower and Ronnie Irani left Essex with 33 to hit with five wickets to spare. Ronnie Irani and James Foster made it with five wickets to spare, and Derbyshire's run of matches without a win continued.\nNational League: Essex v Nottinghamshire (22 August).\nNo result; Essex (2pts), Nottinghamshire (2pts)\nEssex Eagles edged closer to the National League title with two points at Chelmsford, though rain ravaged the game. Only eight overs of play were possible before the umpires called off the game, and in that time Essex lost both openers but still scored at nearly seven an over with the total at 53 for 2 – a score including six wides bowled by the Nottinghamshire Outlaws bowlers.\nCounty Championship: Essex v Somerset (24–27 August).\nSomerset (16pts) beat Essex (5pts) by five wickets\nSomerset exploited Essex' declarations to take their fourth win of the Championship season despite rain curtailing play by nearly 33% at Colchester. After the first day was over with only three overs bowled and Alastair Cook dismissed for a duck, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but double-digit contributions from the rest of the batting line-up – William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 – gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They made their way to 400 and the five batting points before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster added 87 to his overnight score to end with 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel whipped out two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth scored twelve boundaries for an unbeaten 76 at the close of day three to see Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out. André Nel removed Michael Wood for a duck again, but Arul Suppiah added 29 at more than a run a ball, and former England Under-19 player Hildreth settled in well. He made his second unbeaten score of the match, this time worth 125, guiding Somerset past the winning target in 66.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Danish Kaneria bowled 24 of Essex' 66 overs, but to little effect, ending with one wicket for 80 runs, while Nel got William Durston for a duck to end with four wickets for the match – all ducks.\nNational League: Essex v Hampshire (28 August).\nEssex (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 12 runs\nAndré Nel and Danish Kaneria conceded runs at less than four runs an over to help Essex Eagles to victory over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, and the four points for the win increased their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title for Essex. After an opening stand of 70 between William Jefferson and Ronnie Irani, Hampshire got four wickets for 31 as three Essex batsmen were dismissed in single figures before James Middlebrook put on 68 with Jefferson. However, three wickets fell for three runs and the score was 172 for 7, with Jefferson caught for 88, but Hampshire could only take two more wickets in the last half-hour as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria dismissed Pothas and went on to concede 26 in nine overs – well short of the required run rate at five an over, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – with their overseas players Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributing four runs off 18 deliveries, for a run rate of 1.33 an over.\nSeptember.\nSeptember started with a two-day draw with Australia, before Essex beat Lancashire by 55 runs in the National League. Lancashire came back in the Championship, though, beating Essex inside three days to leave Essex 10.5 points adrift of the third-placed Yorkshire – who had a game in hand. Yorkshire drew that game, earning 12 points to increase the distance to 22.5 points, resulting in Essex' promotion chances slimming to exactly zero. Essex had to be content with a National League victory, cementing the already confirmed title with a win over Worcestershire, before a Championship draw with Worcestershire and a seven-wicket League win over Northamptonshire rounded off the season.\nTour Match: Essex v Australians (3–4 September).\nMatch drawn\nBoth sides surpassed 500 in their innings in this two-day match, which included four centuries and expensive bowling figures on either side – as Jason Gillespie was the most economical, with an analysis reading 22–3–80–0. Essex batted first at Chelmsford after winning the toss, and Will Jefferson added 140 for the first wicket with Alastair Cook before being bowled by Michael Kasprowicz. However, the second-wicket partnership was worth even more than the first. Cook slashed 33 fours and one six on his way to 214 – which would have been his highest first class score if the match had had first class status – and added 270 with Ravinder Bopara.\nAfter 105 overs, Essex declared with the score 502 for 4, giving Australia the turn to catch up with the score. Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden added 213 for the first wicket, Hayden went on to make a 118-ball 150 before retiring, while Brad Hodge top scored with 166 from number 4, including a 161-run fifth-wicket partnership with Brad Haddin. For Essex, James Middlebrook got the best bowling figures with two for 110, including Adam Gilchrist for 8, as Australia finished the day's batting practice with the score 561 for 6.\nNational League: Essex v Lancashire (7 September).\nEssex (4pts) beat Lancashire (0pts) by 55 runs\nDutch–South African Ryan ten Doeschate made a career-best 89 not out with five sixes as Essex Eagles made their way to 273 for 6 at Chelmsford. Sajid Mahmood was the main recipient of ten Doeschate's boundary-hitting – ending with figures of two for 67 in nine overs. England Under-19 player Tom Smith, who had taken 15 Test wickets in three U-19 matches with Sri Lanka, finished with 42 conceded runs off his five overs. When Lancashire Lightning batted, Darren Gough got the early wicket of Iain Sutcliffe, and despite scores in the 30s from Andrew Crook and Mal Loye, Lancashire lost their first four wickets for 91 runs. Andrew Symonds rebuilt with Mark Chilton, but once Symonds was bowled by Gough – who ended with four for 31 – Lancashire began to lose wickets, as the last six fell for 65. Kyle Hogg took 25 balls for his 36, lifting Lancashire to a total of 218, but they were still defeated.\nCounty Championship: Essex v Lancashire (9–11 September).\nLancashire (20pts) beat Essex (5pts) by eight wickets\nLancashire's Indian spinner Murali Kartik got match figures of ten for 168 at The County Ground, Chelmsford, helping them to promotion in Division Two of the County Championship with two weeks to spare. Essex won the toss and chose to bat first, and were bowled out for 267, Kartik taking five and James Anderson three wickets. They struggled to 145 for 7, despite Alastair Cook's 64, but James Middlebrook and Andre Adams rescued them to two batting points in the first innings. Iain Sutcliffe and Mark Chilton added 94 for the first wicket, but Adams and Danish Kaneria fought back with two wickets each, as Lancashire ended on 139 for 4. On the second day, Andrew Symonds and Glen Chapple both made fifties, sharing a 136-run stand with sent Lancashire to 340 – before spinners Middlebrook and Danish Kaneria removed the last four wickets for no further score.\nIn the last session of the second day, Kartik took four wickets, and despite six double-digit scores Essex completed the day on 134 for 6, only leading by 61 runs. Sajid Mahmood then took two on the third day to finish Essex off for 227, setting Lancashire 155 to win, and a 106-run opening stand between Mark Chilton and Sutcliffe brought them to the brink. Two wickets from Kaneria did not stop them, as Law hit an unbeaten 13 to power on to an eight-wicket victory, Sutcliffe ending with 80 not out as Lancashire won by eight wickets.\nNational League: Essex v Worcestershire (18 September).\nEssex (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by four wickets\nEssex Eagles continued on their winning ways with their twelfth National League victory of the season, taking a win in the last over thanks to a 78-run stand between Grant Flower and Ravinder Bopara. However, it was Worcestershire Royals who won the toss and batted first, Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki (coming in for Chris Gayle who retired hurt) adding 103 for the first wicket. Gayle returned when Solanki was dismissed, hitting 44, and 25 from Ben Smith helped Worcestershire to 227 for 5. Andre Adams took three wickets as Worcestershire lost four for one solitary run, but Smith added 10 with the number 11 Nadeem Malik to bring the total of 240 for 9. Essex lost captain Ronnie Irani for nine early on, but a stroke-filled half-century from Alastair Cook sent Essex to 135 for 3, and Grant Flower then hit four sixes to complete a run-a-ball 81. Despite two late wickets from Kabir Ali, Bopara saw Essex home with five deliveries to spare to finish on 46 not out.\nCounty Championship: Worcestershire v Essex (21–24 September).\nWorcestershire (11pts) drew with Essex (10pts)\nA total of 19 wickets fell in four days at New Road, despite only half a day being lost to rain. Batting first, Essex made 574, with Worcestershire's Stuart Wedge taking five for 112 in his second first class game, getting Ravinder Bopara as his first wicket. Essex got two wickets in the first 40 minutes; first class debutant Jahid Ahmed got his first wicket by removing 21-year-old Daryl Mitchell for 6, and Andre Adams bowled Graeme Hick for 17, but Worcestershire's third-wicket partnership added 333 in a little over four hours, with Stephen Moore hitting 152 out of his 191 runs in boundaries. However, Worcestershire declared at the end of the third day on 424 for 3, and Essex scored 201 for one wicket in 36 overs, Alastair Cook rounding off his first season as an Essex regular with an unbeaten 117. Worcestershire were set 352 in 60 overs to win, and despite an 84-ball ton from Graeme Hick Worcestershire finished four runs short of the ten extra points a win would have given.\nNational League: Northamptonshire v Essex (25 September).\nEssex (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by seven wickets\nEssex Eagles took their thirteenth win in sixteen matches to round off their one-day season to end with a 16-point victory overall. Their bowlers built the foundation for this victory, as all seven bowlers to be used got at least one wicket, and despite half-centuries from Australians Martin Love and Damien Wright Northamptonshire Steelbacks were bowled out for 208. Wright then took two wickets to set Essex back to 22 for 2, but Alastair Cook then followed his 117 not out against Worcestershire in the County Championship earlier on in the week. His 110-ball 94 – a career best List A score, improving his previous best by 32 runs – was part of a 168-run stand with Grant Flower, which took Essex to the brink, with 190 for 3. Flower then hit the remaining 19 runs with Ravinder Bopara, and Essex won with seven wickets and 25 balls in hand.\nStatistics.\nFirst-class cricket.\nMost runs.\n\"Qualification: 750 runs\"\nMost wickets.\n\"Qualification: 30 wickets\"\nList-A cricket.\nMost runs.\n\"Qualification: 300 runs\"\nMost wickets.\n\"Qualification: 15 wickets\""

        "title": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005",
        "text": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club started their 2005 season as defending totesport League champions, but the 2005 season ended without a trophy – instead, they suffered relegation in the first-class form. They played their first-class cricket in the First Division of the County Championship. They started the Championship season at 25–1 to win, and favourites to be relegated – which they eventually were, winning one of sixteen games in the Championship season to finish bottom – nearly 100 points behind the first team to avoid relegation. By the end of August, they had confirmed relegation with three games remaining. In the National League, they hovered around mid-table for most of the season, before a run of three unbeaten games at the end of August sent them out of the relegation zone, and they finished the season in fourth place. In the C&amp;G Trophy, they were knocked out at the second round stage by eventual champions Hampshire, while the Twenty20 campaign saw them finish bottom of their group with two wins from eight matches.\nGlamorgan played 17 first class games in 2005, winning one, drawing two and losing 14. Their 18 List A matches gave seven wins, seven losses and four no-results, while eight Twenty20 matches ended with two wins, five losses and one no-result.\nMatch details.\nApril.\nTheir first three-day game of the season was batting practice against the students of Cardiff UCCE, where Glamorgan made 994 runs for the loss of thirteen wickets in a drawn game. They then moved on to an away Championship match with defending county champions Warwickshire, which they lost by an innings and 43 runs.\nAfter that, their first two totesport League games were washed out by rain and abandoned as no results. The next Championship game was also lost, against Surrey, as Glamorgan ended the month without victories in any form of cricket.\nMCC University Match: Glamorgan v Cardiff UCCE (9–11 April).\nMatch drawn\nOn the first day of this match at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, Glamorgan scored runs at nearly six an over as David Hemp (120), Matthew Maynard (105) and Ian Thomas (133) all making centuries. They continued on the second day, adding 87 for the last three wickets to end with a total of 603, until Cardiff UCCE finally dismissed them – before they were bowled out for 152 in reply, spinner Dean Cosker taking three for 13. However, Glamorgan chose not to enforce the follow-on and elected for more batting practice. By close of play they were 134 for no loss. On the third and final day, Mark Wallace and Jonathan Hughes both completed their centuries, making 117 and 109 (retired hurt) respectively. Glamorgan eventually declared on 381 for 3 after 28 third-day overs, leaving Cardiff UCCE an impossible 833 to win – before Andrew Davies nipped out a wicket after five minutes. After Simon Jones got another, and Cardiff UCCE were 57 for 2, Rhodri Lloyd and Simon Butler got together for three hours, until the end of the match. When Lloyd was out for 102, Butler was on 104, and the game ended in a draw.\nCounty Championship: Warwickshire v Glamorgan (13–16 April).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (1pt) by an innings and 43 runs\nGlamorgan won the toss at a cold Edgbaston and chose to bat. The pitch had been roughed up to encourage turn for the benefit of Ashley Giles. The England selectors would have been pleased that he made the most of it, taking six for 44, the third-best figures of his first-class career to date. Earlier in that innings, however, Matthew Elliott, Glamorgan's Australian batsman scored 84 to take his team to a comfortable looking 157 for 3. However, Glamorgan then lost their final seven wickets for 41 runs. Warwickshire held five catches to restrict their opposition to 198, two short of their first bonus point. Nick Knight and Mark Wagh then saw Warwickshire through to 68 for no loss, before bad light stopped play.\nAfter losing Knight and Wagh with only 4 added to the overnight score, the Champion county showed their class. After the start of the day, the pitch calmed down, and England hopeful, Ian Bell, who scored 96, and Mike Powell put on 153 for the fourth wicket. Dougie Brown then helped himself to a half-century being unbeaten on 85 at close, with Powell on 144 not out and Warwickshire on 415 for 4, 217 ahead. Alex Wharf and Simon Jones bowled enthusiastically, but without much to show for it.\nOn a cold third day, runs came at around five an over, though this was aided by the short boundaries. This allowed 362 runs to be scored, even though almost all the third session was lost to bad light. In the first session of the third day, Warwickshire's runs flowed freely. Although Powell only added 2, Brown moved on to 122, and Heath Streak had time to score 41 not out before Warwickshire declared on 564 for 8, 366 ahead. Elliott and David Hemp put on 162 for the second wicket. However, Matthew Maynard went for a duck, leaving Glamorgan on 213 for 4 at close.\nOn the fourth day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a partnership of 75, but this was not enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, \"Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch they were always going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We had a bit of luck so we are not going to start going around saying that we are going to win the Championship just because we have won one match.\" John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, \"Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we didn't get back into the game.\"\nNational League: Lancashire v Glamorgan (17 April).\nMatch abandoned – Lancashire (2pts), Glamorgan (2pts)\nSimon Jones took three for 19 for the defending champions Glamorgan Dragons when they took on Lancashire Lightning at Old Trafford. Afterwards he said, \"The older I've got the easier I've found bowling. My control has got better over the last couple of years and that showed today.\" Alex Wharf and Robert Croft chipped in as well, both taking two wickets as Lancashire moved to 160 for 8 off 41.2 overs, with Hogg top-scoring with 41 not out. Rain then brought proceedings to a close and the game was abandoned. (BBC scorecard)\nNational League: Glamorgan v Essex (22 April).\nMatch abandoned – Glamorgan (2pts), Essex (2pts)\nThis match, which was scheduled to be played at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff, was abandoned without a ball being bowled. It was the first time for almost eight years a one-day league match at Cardiff has ended as a no-result. (BBC scorecard)\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Surrey (27–30 April).\nSurrey (18pts) beat Glamorgan (5pts) by five wickets\nGlamorgan batted first at Cardiff, coming out finally at 2:30 p.m. as rain delayed the start. Matthew Elliott was then dismissed first ball. However, Mark Wallace performed better, adding 86 from 107 balls to still be there at the close of play. Surrey probably had the best of the day, which ended with the Dragons on 238 for 9. However, it could have been a lot worse for Glamorgan, as David Hemp was dropped three times. Mohammad Akram got good rewards for his bowling, taking four wickets.\nGlamorgan picked up 12 more runs on day two to finish on 250. Then, on another rain affected day, Surrey moved to 162 for 4. The day's highlight was an innings by Mark Ramprakash, Surrey's stand-in captain, who became the second active player to pass 25,000 first-class runs. He finished the day on 72 not out. The second day ended with Surrey on 162 for 4.\nRamprakash completed his century on the third day, but only Rikki Clarke (35) could add more than 20 runs, and Surrey were bowled out for 248. Surrey had a two-run deficit to catch up with, but they did it, mainly thanks to James Ormond. Ormond swung his way to seven for 63, helping Surrey on their way to victory. Ormond reduced Glamorgan to 15 for 2 by lunch and 87 for 7 in the 19th over. Glamorgan's last three partnerships added 86, but the target was still lower than Surrey's first-innings score, with 176. Surrey hit at nearly five runs an over as they approached their target and were 122 for 4 off 26 overs at close, Ramprakash on 49.\nSurrey took under 35 minutes to wrap up victory, and they only lost one wicket in the 10 overs it took. Ramprakash again was the mainstay of the innings and was not out for 68 when the winning runs came. (BBC scorecard)\nMay.\nThe Dragons finally got to complete a one-day league match, and also recorded their first win of the season, winning a shortened match at Trent Bridge by four runs, and following it up with a C&amp;G Trophy victory over Suffolk on 4 May. That was followed up with two more Championship losses, against Gloucestershire and then Surrey, and the streak of defeats continued as eventual champions Essex beat them by five wickets in the National League. The defending champions of one-day league cricket then got knocked out of the C&amp;G Trophy with a six-wicket defeat at home to Hampshire, and their fifth successive Championship loss also came at the hands of Hampshire, before they rounded off the month as it started by beating Worcestershire Royals in a day/night National League game at Sophia Gardens. They finished May bottom of the First Division of the Championship.\nNational League: Nottinghamshire v Glamorgan (2 May).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by 4 runs (D/L method)\nGlamorgan recorded their first win of the season at Trent Bridge after they had begun their League campaign with two no results. In an innings that turned out to be restricted to 38 overs, they scored 204 for 4, which by the Duckworth–Lewis method was converted into a target of 222 for the Nottinghamshire Outlaws. The Outlaws were 52 for 4 in reply before a partnership of 99 between David Hussey (68) and Chris Read (47) lifted them – however, they were both dismissed by Dean Cosker as Nottinghamshire lost four wickets for 28 to stand at 179 for 8. Samit Patel came in at nine and hit two sixes in his 40, as Nottinghamshire passed the Glamorgan first-innings total, but due to Glamorgan's innings being interrupted before they knew how many overs they would face, the Duckworth-Lewis calculations stated that Nottinghamshire were four runs behind their par score. (BBC scorecard)\nC&amp;G Trophy Round One: Suffolk v Glamorgan (4 May).\nGlamorgan beat Suffolk by 143 runs to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nAfter rain, play began at 3 p.m. at Bury St Edmunds with Glamorgan batting first. The highlight of their innings was an undefeated 100 from Matthew Elliott in 104 balls, with six of seven batsmen passing 20 as the visitors racked up 320 for 5. Mike Powell was the only Glamorgan batsman to not pass 20, as he was dismissed for a duck by former Essex bowler Andrew McGarry. Suffolk lost their first four batsmen – including New Zealand international Lou Vincent – for single-figure scores, going to 12 for 3 and then 33 for 4, and to spare the need for the match going into a second day, play continued in near-darkness to 8:40 p.m., with Glamorgan bowling their last 32 overs (all with spin, in order to make conditions playable for batsmen) in 80 minutes. Staffordshire finally finished on 177 for 8 off their 50 overs, with their numbers six, eight and nine in the order all passing 35.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Gloucestershire (6–9 May).\nGloucestershire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (4pts) by 7 wickets\nGloucestershire batted first at Cardiff and made runs at a rate of nearly four an over on their way to their only win of the 2005 season. With the top four all making more than 25 runs and the three first partnerships all accounting for more than fifty runs, Chris Taylor hit his way to 176 off 185 balls with four sixes, hitting 76 runs with the last 43 balls he faced. By the close of play, Gloucestershire were 439 for 8, with Upul Chandana just dismissed by Robert Croft. England ODI bowler Alex Wharf did the brunt of the bowling effort with 30.1 overs, getting Taylor out eventually, and finishing with three wickets for 127 as Gloucestershire were bowled out for 466 early on the second day.\nMatthew Elliott and Ian Thomas started the reply well for the hosts Glamorgan, putting on 40 for the first wicket before Thomas departed, but the Gloucestershire seamers Jon Lewis and Alex Gidman shared out wickets to reduce Glamorgan to 48 for 4. Double-digit contributions from the lower order, led by wicket-keeper Mark Wallace, who made a half-century, lifted Glamorgan to a total of 239 – still 237 behind Wallace. Following on, Glamorgan batted for nearly 25 overs before losing their first wicket – Ian Thomas – and stumps were drawn when that happened, leaving Glamorgan on 93 for 1.\nThe third day, however, was the day of the spinners. After Matt Elliott (123), David Hemp (57) and Mike Powell (39) took Glamorgan to 274 for 2 and a lead of 47, Sri Lankan leg-spinner Chandana and all-rounder Ian Fisher shared the last eight wickets between them for 71 runs, Chandana finishing with five for 117 and Fisher with four for 89, and resulting in a target of 119 for Gloucestershire to win. Glamorgan's spinners also took wickets, Dean Cosker and Robert Croft grabbing three as Gloucestershire to 59 for 3 at close on day 3, but on the morning of day 4, Gloucestershire batsman Tim Hancock – in his 15th season with the team – guided the visitors to the target with an unbeaten 41.\nCounty Championship: Surrey v Glamorgan (11–14 May).\nSurrey (22pts) beat Glamorgan (6pts) by 276 runs\nGlamorgan went down to their fourth successive defeat, this time to Surrey, who had been defeated by Nottinghamshire in their previous game. At The Oval, there was a short boundary towards Harleyford Road, over which Scott Newman (117) and Ali Brown (122) hit plenty of runs to take Surrey to 441 for 7 on the first day. They lost their final three wickets on the second day for three more runs. However, 444 was enough to get a first-innings lead, as Glamorgan were dismissed for 345 with Martin Bicknell taking six for 74. The last three Glamorgan partnerships added 154 runs, with No. 9 David Harrison top-scoring with 75 not out. Surrey were in to bat again before the second day ended, and were 66 for no loss at stumps, with 855 runs hit in two days.\nOn the third day, Newman (219) became the first man to make both a century and a double century in a game for Surrey as they finally declared on 425 for 4, leaving a theoretical target of 525. Bicknell then took his 1,000th wicket for Surrey as Glamorgan batted to 177 for 2 at close, with David Hemp and Mike Powell on 77 and 80 not out respectively. However, one session was enough to finish off Glamorgan, with Rikki Clarke and Mohammad Akram getting reverse swing to take 3 and 4 wickets respectively, as Glamorgan were reduced to 248 all out. Their last 7 wickets fell for 28 runs. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNational League: Essex v Glamorgan (15 May).\nEssex (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by five wickets\nEssex Eagles continued their unbeaten run in all cricket this season after getting the 185 runs they needed for the last six wickets against Glamorgan Dragons at Chelmsford. Essex won the toss and chose to field first, and Glamorgan made 216 for 7. James Middlebrook was the main contributor with the ball, taking two for 27 off 9 overs, but South African pace bowler Dale Steyn also contributed with three for 34 amid no-balls and wides. Andrew Davies and David Harrison then reduced Essex to 31 for 4 before Ravi Bopara (96 not out) and, once again, Middlebrook (46) took centre stage. With a partnership of 122, the two cut nearly two-thirds off the target, and wicket-keeper James Foster contributed with 38 off 30 balls to see Essex to the target with five wickets and sixteen balls to spare.\nC&amp;G Trophy Round Two: Glamorgan v Hampshire (17 May).\nHampshire beat Glamorgan by six wickets to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C &amp; G Trophy\nZimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine and wicket-keeper Nic Pothas made the most impact with ball and bat respectively for Hampshire as they defeated Glamorgan at Cardiff. Mike Powell was the only batsman to pass 40, making 56 runs in a little over an hour in a Glamorgan total of 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his 10 overs – admittedly mostly tail-enders, but he got the most wickets – while Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-overs century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball – Hampshire were 89 for 4 before England prospect Kevin Pietersen came in to hit 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare.\nCounty Championship: Hampshire v Glamorgan (20–23 May).\nHampshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (3pts) by nine wickets\nAmid showers at Southampton, Hampshire batted their way to the big lead they were expected to get against Glamorgan, who had lost four games in the Championship before this. Former England batsman John Crawley took a day for his century, while in contrast Kevin Pietersen took two-and-a-half hours for his, making a century off 99 balls and ending with 126. Hampshire eventually made 401 for 8 declared to get full batting points before attacking Glamorgan. Chris Tremlett reaped Glamorgan wickets in the next innings, removing David Hemp, Mike Powell and Jonathan Hughes among others to take four for 42 and reduce Glamorgan to 229 – a score that would have been much lower but for Darren Thomas, who blitzed his way to 63. Following on, Glamorgan got to 77 for 1 at stumps on day three, but wickets tumbled in the morning, reducing Glamorgan to 147 for 5. Robert Croft and Mike Powell rebuilt, but when Australian batsman Simon Katich had Croft caught by skipper Shane Warne and Powell went a few overs later, Glamorgan ended on a total of 250 as Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine picked up the last three wickets, finishing with five for 60, while Tremlett took three for 48. In reply, Hampshire reached the target of 79 inside 15 overs, with Katich – unusually – opening the batting. With Nottinghamshire losing to Kent and Warwickshire and Surrey not playing, Hampshire took the lead in the Championship with their emphatic full-score win.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Worcestershire (27 May).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 53 runs\nDavid Hemp gave Glamorgan Dragons a much-needed win in the National League against Worcestershire Royals, to break a streak of five successive cricket matches without a win, as his 65 lifted the team to what turned out to be an unreachable 227 – despite three run outs. When Glamorgan bowled everyone got wickets, and Worcestershire's best batsman of the innings, Zander de Bruyn with 51 runs, was eventually frustrated enough to get run out. Former England under-19 player David Harrison notched up the second five-wicket haul of his List A career, taking five for 33.\nJune.\nGlamorgan avoided loss for the first time of the Championship season against Sussex in a game reduced to three days because of rain. The following day, Glamorgan's Sunday League game against Nottinghamshire was abandoned because of rain, their third abandoned match out of six thus far in the season. Two Championship losses followed, to Kent and Middlesex (in a match where each team lost seven wickets, and three innings were ended by declarations). The next day, they were also beaten by Hampshire in Southampton, to go into the Twenty20 Cup without a win in June.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Sussex (1–4 June).\nSussex (12pts) drew with Glamorgan (8pts)\nAlthough Glamorgan followed on at Swansea, they still managed a draw after the first day was rained off. On the second day, which was also shortened, Sussex scored 225 for 2 after Glamorgan won the toss and put them in. Two Sussex batsmen reached their highest scores of 2005 on the third morning, as Richard Montgomerie ended with 184 not out – 12 off his career best – and Murray Goodwin reached 158. Sussex finally declared on 497 for 5, and in reply Matthew Elliott made 85 and David Hemp 128 and Glamorgan reached 301, which was not enough to avoid the follow-on. The experienced fast bowler Jason Lewry took six for 77 for Sussex, while the Welsh team's new import, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, scored a duck in his first innings. However, Glamorgan achieved a draw as Matthew Elliott made 162 and they survived for 80 overs. When time was called, Glamorgan were on 354 for 3. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNational League: Glamorgan v Nottinghamshire (5 June).\nMatch abandoned – Glamorgan (2pts), Nottinghamshire (2pts)\nThis match, which was due to be played at Swansea, was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of rain.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Kent (8–10 June).\nKent (21.5pts) beat Glamorgan (6pts) by 10 wickets\nGlamorgan went down to their fifth defeat of the season at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. After winning the toss and losing two wickets for 16, Kent's next eight wickets added over 30 times that as Kent ended with a total of 568, thanks mainly to 262 not out from Martin van Jaarsveld – the highest score of the English county season thus far – with Darren Stevens (80) and Min Patel (87) sharing partnerships of more than 125 runs with Van Jaarsveld. Glamorgan had nine double-figure scores in reply, but unlike Kent they had no one to go past 70, and they were bowled out for 358 after six Kent bowlers had taken at least one wicket. The follow-on was enforced, and now Glamorgan had to be content with seven single-figure scores after Amjad Khan and Andrew Hall took care of their top order. Khan ripped out three early wickets – for which Glamorgan managed five runs, and Martin Saggers and Andrew Hall was responsible for the next two wicket, leaving the Welsh team at 34 for 5. Their overseas player, Sourav Ganguly, who played in his second match this season, added 55% of the Glamorgan team score, making 142 in three hours before he was last out, caught by Van Jaarsveld for 142. Kent were set a target of 51 in their second innings, which they achieved without loss of a wicket to win inside three days. Kent were deducted half a point for a slow over rate.\nCounty Championship: Middlesex v Glamorgan (15–18 June).\nMiddlesex (20pts) beat Glamorgan (6pts) by six wickets\nMiddlesex won the match at Southgate, where only 14 wickets fell in four days, while seven centuries were hit, including a double-century. After the first day was shortened by rain, Glamorgan got into their stride on the second day, Dan Cherry taking seven hours to make 226 runs – while Middlesex' best bowling figures came from Melvyn Betts, taking one for 80. Glamorgan declared on 584 for 3, and Middlesex replied in fashion, declaring on 435 for 4 in an attempt to get a result – Ed Joyce scoring 155. Three quick wickets from Alan Richardson gave Middlesex some hope of forcing Glamorgan out, but a 118-ball 84 not out from Sourav Ganguly and Jonathan Hughes' second century of the match resulted in Glamorgan setting a target of 408 in 82 overs – a rate similar to that required in one-day cricket. However, more centuries awaited, as Ed Smith and Owais Shah took Middlesex to 380 for 1 (admittedly with Ben Hutton retired hurt), and Irishman Joyce made 70 not out to see Middlesex to the target.\nNational League: Hampshire v Glamorgan (19 June).\nHampshire (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by seven wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons only took three wickets, which was not enough to defend a total of 211 against Hampshire Hawks at the Rose Bowl. Batting first, Glamorgan made it to 117 for 1 before spinners Shaun Udal and Shane Warne chipped away at the Glamorgan middle-order with five wickets together. Robert Croft, the former England spinner, top-scored with 88 from the opening position, while an eighth-wicket partnership of 23 between Mark Wallace and David Harrison took Glamorgan to a total of 211 for 7. It was never enough, however, as all Hampshire batsmen – excluding Derek Kenway, who was out for 4 – fired to score more than 30 runs. With 45 deliveries and seven wickets remaining, Hampshire passed the victory target to increase the gap to the relegation zone.\nTwenty20 Cup – Group Stage.\nGlamorgan began their Twenty20 Cup with a win against eventual champions Somerset Sabres after losing fewer wickets than the Sabres, but lost the next four matches, and after the fifth was rained off they were ensured of not qualifying for the quarter-final stage – although their 5 July win over Gloucestershire Gladiators was one of the main reasons Gloucestershire did not qualify. Their last match with Worcestershire was without any real importance for either team, as both teams were knocked out, but Worcestershire were still allowed to make the fourth-highest score in Twenty20 Cup history – totalling 223.\nGlamorgan v Somerset (22 June).\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) on losing fewer wickets\nJames Hildreth was the most rapid scorer for the Sabres, making 46 off 26 deliveries at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres made a total of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. Alex Wharf took three wickets for Glamorgan, the most, but conceded 38 in three overs to be Glamorgan's most expensive bowler too. A highlight of Somerset's innings was the effort of their number 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before fifth- and sixth-change bowlers Keith Parsons and Hildreth got the better of them and shared five wickets, leaving Glamorgan at 167 for 7. However, Alex Wharf hung in there with Mike Powell, making 11 off five balls before he was caught off the sixth, and coupled with Powell's unbeaten 68 Glamorgan finished on a total of 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, that under Twenty20 Cup rules the team with the fewer wickets lost would win.\nGloucestershire v Glamorgan (24 June).\nGloucestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by seven wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons lost their first nine wickets for 90 runs, as the bowling of Gloucestershire Gladiators' Carl Greenidge, Martyn Ball and Mark Hardinges took more than two wickets each. Greenidge also bowled a maiden over, ending with three for 15. A last-wicket partnership of 38 between Robert Croft and Dean Cosker ensured that Glamorgan batted out 20 overs, finishing on 128 for 9. However, they could not defend it – Croft took two wickets with his off spin, but Craig Spearman's 39 was the highest score as the Gladiators took the victory with 17 balls to spare.\nGlamorgan v Warwickshire (25 June).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 54 runs\nWarwickshire Bears won their first Twenty20 match of the season, the deep batting line-up finally paying off. Almost every batsman contributed in their total of 205 for 7, Jamie Troughton top-scoring with 42, and no Glamorgan Dragons bowler escaped their wrath. When the Dragons batted, only Matthew Elliott and Sourav Ganguly gave them any hope of winning, and Ganguly's 36 off 35 balls was much slower than the required rate, which was above 10 an over. A disciplined Warwickshire fielding effort – the Bears only conceded one extra – and Alex Loudon taking five for 33, resulted in Glamorgan falling to 151 all out in 18.2 overs.\nSomerset v Glamorgan (27 June).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 89 runs\nJames Hildreth hit his second quick knock against Glamorgan in a week, taking 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, they made a dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as experienced off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four, and Somerset made a total of 212 for 3. In reply, the visitors had no one to pass 30 once Mike Powell went, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.\nWarwickshire v Glamorgan (30 June).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by four runs\nGlamorgan Dragons lengthened their run of losses to four, despite requiring 22 for the last seven wickets at Edgbaston. Jamie Troughton's 51 took Warwickshire Bears past 100 after they had lost their first four wickets for 56, and Dougie Brown along with 11 extras gave the hosts a total of 169 for 9. Glamorgan started well, with Sourav Ganguly and Matthew Elliott lifting them to 88 for 1 before leaving in quick succession to Neil Carter and Jonathan Trott respectively. Mike Powell and David Hemp (40 off 19 balls) then built another partnership of 59 to see Glamorgan 147 for 3, but Carter and Brown then shared five wickets as Glamorgan's next five wickets fell for six runs. Powell added 11 with Dean Cosker, but the damage was already done, and Powell was run out on the penultimate ball as they needed six runs from two balls. Adam Harrison needed to hit the final ball for six, but only managed a single.\nGlamorgan v Northamptonshire (1 July).\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled; Glamorgan (1pt), Northamptonshire (1pt)\nThe weather at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff prevented a match from getting underway between Glamorgan Dragons and Northamptonshire Steelbacks, resulting in the Dragons being knocked out.\nGlamorgan v Gloucestershire (5 July).\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by ten wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons broke their streak of five successive matches without a win as they achieved victory without any of their batsmen getting dismissed at Sophia Gardens. The two brothers David and Adam Harrison took two wickets each for Glamorgan, as Gloucestershire Gladiators lost their first seven wickets for 57. Jon Lewis and Mark Alleyne then shared a 68-run stand, but a quick burst of wickets from Robert Croft and Andrew Davies saw them bowled out for 128. Croft and Matthew Elliott both made fifties as Glamorgan knocked off the runs with ten wickets and 7.3 overs to spare, helped by five no-balls and four wides from the Gloucestershire bowlers.\nWorcestershire v Glamorgan (6 July).\nWorcestershire (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 37 runs\nBoth Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were knocked out before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the result of the match at New Road was academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from amassing the fourth-highest total in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 – Ben Smith taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan failed to score quickly enough Worcestershire and Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar – who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up by losing five wickets in 20 overs, but 224 was too high a rate after Akhtar's seven-an-over spell, and they finished with a total 186 for 5.\nJuly.\nAfter two wins to end the Twenty20 Cup, it was back to losing in the County Championship, going down to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge for their eighth loss in nine games. In the National League, however, they jumped up to third place thanks to a five-wicket win over Worcestershire. However, they looked unlikely to advance further from that third place, as they went down to second-placed Middlesex at home in the National League, and Middlesex also defeated them in the County Championship encounter, as Glamorgan went down by an innings and 23 runs. They then achieved their second first-class draw of the season, in a three-day match with Bangladesh A where over half the match was lost to rain.\nCounty Championship: Nottinghamshire v Glamorgan (8–11 July).\nNottinghamshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (5pts) by ten wickets\nGlamorgan remained on the bottom of the Championship table after their eighth loss in nine County Championship games, this time to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. The hosts won the toss and sent Glamorgan in to bat, and got wickets, admittedly while conceding runs at a rate of more than four an over in the process – the final score was 261 in 61 overs. Chris Read, the former England wicket-keeper, then made his fifth first-class century with a 117-ball ton, only to be departed by Nottinghamshire's last man Mark Footitt shortly afterwards – left stranded on 103 not out. Nottinghamshire, however, had made it to a total of 425, and Footitt made amends with the ball, taking four for 45 amid no-balls and wides. Glamorgan were taken out for 214 midway through the third day, as nine batsmen made it into double figures but none could go beyond 35, and Nottinghamshire openers Darren Bicknell and Jason Gallian went past the target of 57 in 17.4 overs as Nottinghamshire recorded a full-score win.\nNational League: Worcestershire v Glamorgan (17 July).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by five wickets\nWorcestershire Royals failed to defend a total of 273 for 3 – their highest of the season thus far – against Glamorgan Dragons at New Road. Winning the toss and batting first, Worcestershire captain Vikram Solanki paired up for 91 with Stephen Moore, who would go on to make 104. Zander de Bruyn also made an unbeaten fifty to lift Worcestershire to 273 for 3. The Indian international Sourav Ganguly was the only Glamorgan bowler to escape with less than five runs an over to his name, as he got one wicket for 19 in his five overs. Worcestershire dismissed Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled by David Leatherdale, who took two for 35. Another wicket fell shortly afterwards, and Glamorgan were 67 for 3, but Ganguly made 53, Mike Powell contributed 82, and David Hemp sealed the win with his unbeaten 51 off 36 ball. The Glamorgan batsmen took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty, who finished wicketless for 69 runs.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Middlesex (20 July).\nMiddlesex (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 111 runs\nAfter Paul Weekes had taken Middlesex Crusaders to 149 for 5 after his 72, the young batsmen showed an appetite for runs as Glamorgan Dragons sunk to a defeat in this match between number two and three in the one-day tables. Both Ed Joyce and Ben Hutton made 61 at rates well-over a run a ball, and added 110 for the sixth wicket, before number 11 Alan Richardson finished off with a last-ball six off Robert Croft to bring the total to 284 for 9 after Croft had grabbed three late wickets. Chris Peploe then took four for 38, pinch hitters Croft and Alex Wharf were run out, Owais Shah held four catches despite not being the wicket-keeper, and Glamorgan were bowled out for 173 in 35.4 overs, leaving them losers by 111 runs, their heaviest defeat by runs in one-day cricket all season.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Middlesex (21–23 July).\nMiddlesex (22pts) beat Glamorgan (4pts) by an innings and 23 runs\nThe sixth-placed Middlesex inflicted the ninth defeat of the season on Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens, and their second of three innings defeats. After winning the toss, Ed Smith dominated proceedings in the first hour, making 29 in an opening stand of 40 before he was bowled by Huw Waters, Ben Hutton and Owais Shah made a partnership of 109 to lift Middlesex, and their batting line-up from one to nine all made it past 25 as the score finished on 534 – Shah finishing on 101, his third of seven Championship centuries, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple scoring a season-high 108, and number nine Peter Trego smacking 72 off 54 balls – also a season-best. When Glamorgan batted, Trego took three wickets in the first two hours, to end with three for 52, and Scott Styris helped to dismiss the Glamorgan tail, removing numbers six, eight and nine to take three for 42. Only Robert Croft passed 25 – making 84 off 76 balls with 72 runs in boundaries – as Glamorgan were bowled out for 232 in a session and a half and were asked to follow on.\nMiddlesex seamer Melvyn Betts set back Glamorgan's second innings effort with two wickets to see them to 25 for 2, but opener and wicket-keeper Mark Wallace top-scored with 64, and Sourav Ganguly also made 55 as Glamorgan made their way to 208 for 5, still needing 96 to make Middlesex bat again. However, Styris took the last four wickets en route to bowling figures of five for 57, his second five-for of the season, as Middlesex secured the innings victory.\nTour match: Glamorgan v Bangladesh A (26–28 July).\nMatch drawn\nAfter a first day in which Glamorgan had racked up 380 runs, Mike Powell top-scoring with 111 and Alex Wharf making 77 while Syed Rasel took four for 89, the touring Bangladesh A side were sent in to bat. Only 10.1 overs of play was possible on the second day, though, and Andrew Davies took two wickets while Wharf was taken for 36 runs off just five overs. Day three was rained out, so the match at Abergavenny ended in a draw, with Bangladesh A finishing on 54 for 2.\nAugust.\nAugust started with two losses in first-class games, to Kent and Warwickshire, and they also recorded a National League loss to Lancashire. A five-wicket win over Northamptonshire three days later saw them out of the relegation zone, however, and they continued the trend by beating Gloucestershire in the same competition. They followed up their good form, recording their third victory in a row – and their first in the County Championship all season – by beating Gloucestershire. Their good form was ended a week later by Nottinghamshire, however.\nCounty Championship: Kent v Glamorgan (3–5 August).\nKent (22pts) beat Glamorgan (5pts) by an innings and 124 runs\nKent, as expected, beat Glamorgan, but were worried on occasion. Having been shaken early on as Glamorgan dug out four early wickets, Kent were lifted by a 267-run partnership between Darren Stevens (who made 208) and Andrew Hall (133) which helped them along the way to a final first-innings score of 587, with Min Patel taking 55 balls for a 64 from number nine. Six Glamorgan players were then out in single figures, Amjad Khan taking three for 68, but number three David Hemp stood tall with an unbeaten 171. Glamorgan were 188 for 9 at one point on day two, but survived to stumps to 236 for 9, and just kept going – their number 11, Huw Waters, made 34 from 192 balls, and he added 118 with Hemp, for the second-highest stand of the match.\nHowever, Hemp was worn out after his marathon knock, and was sent in at five as Glamorgan followed on. Glamorgan were bundled out for 157, Hemp only lasting half an hour before he was lbw to Hall, who took four for 32. Justin Kemp and Simon Cook also got two wickets each, while Jonathan Hughes top-scored with 27. This was Glamorgan's 10th loss in the County Championship this season.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Warwickshire (10–12 August).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Glamorgan (3pts) by ten wickets\nWarwickshire took control of proceedings on the first day at Colwyn Bay, as they fielded a bowling attack with no English-born players against Glamorgan. South Africa international Makhaya Ntini was the least effective, only getting the wicket of number 11 Dean Cosker, and conceding 49 runs in the process. Meanwhile, Scot Dougie Brown took four for 58, but Glamorgan actually recovered quite well from 76 for 6 to their final score of 239. However, their blunt bowling attack were shown up again, as Ian Westwood recorded his maiden first-class century, four batsmen passed fifty, and Warwickshire muscled their way to 545 for 7 before declaring. Jonathan Trott also made 152 for Warwickshire, while Robert Croft was the most effective bowler – with three for 126.\nWicket-keeper Mark Wallace then smashed 68 not out off 50 balls to see Glamorgan to the end of the day at 99 for 1. However, he only faced two balls on the third morning before being lbw to Brown. Most of the Warwickshire bowlers got in among the wickets – part-time medium pace bowler Trott taking two for 19 in four overs, for example – and Warwickshire were set three to win, which they achieved off 14 deliveries, culminating in Nick Knight hitting a single off David Harrison.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Lancashire (14 August).\nLancashire (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by eight wickets\nLancashire Lightning recorded a relatively easy victory at Colwyn Bay, beating Glamorgan Dragons by eight wickets. Dominic Cork took four for 37 as the Dragons crashed to 173 all out, Alex Wharf – who had been promoted to three as pinch hitter – top scoring with 36. Mal Loye then carried Lancashire past the target with 79 not out, while Stuart Law, Marcus North and Andrew Symonds all passed 25.\nNational League: Northamptonshire v Glamorgan (17 August).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons bowler David Harrison bowled a fierce spell which only conceded 17 runs in nine overs – including five runs to extras – as Glamorgan limited the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks to 201 all out at Sophia Gardens. Northamptonshire's Riki Wessels hit 80 off 72 balls to take the score past 200 before lofting the ball to Dan Cherry to be last out. However, his 54-run partnership with Johann Louw gave Northamptonshire some hope of posing a challenge. Wickets fell with reasonable regularity, but captain Robert Croft refused to be dismissed, and his 81 not out anchored the chase. Richard Grant scored 22 not out as well, as Glamorgan made it to the target with 20 deliveries to spare, despite two wickets from Bilal Shafayat.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Gloucestershire (23 August).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by four wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators crashed back into the relegation zone with a defeat against Glamorgan Dragons at Sophia Gardens, succumbing to medium-pace bowler David Harrison, who bowled four maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 9–4–16–2. Despite half-centuries from Kabir Ali and Alex Gidman, who looked to give the visitors a comfortable target after moving to 103 for 3, Dean Cosker ripped out three quick wickets, and Gidman was forced to consolidate. He did top score with 62, but Glamorgan were set a rather modest target of 195 to win. Jon Lewis made inroads with his medium pace early on, taking three wickets as Glamorgan stuttered to 40 for 4, but Mike Powell and Dan Cherry put Glamorgan back in it with a 79-run stand, and Gloucestershire's bowlers were made to rue their 15 wides, as they helped Glamorgan to reach their target with two overs remaining.\nCounty Championship: Gloucestershire v Glamorgan (25–28 August).\nGlamorgan (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (3pts) by 322 runs\nGlamorgan recorded their first Championship win in 13 attempts this season at Bristol against fellow relegation candidates Gloucestershire. Dan Cherry made his second century of the season with changing partners, as he carried his bat to 152 not out at stumps – the total on 350 for 8. Cherry was last out, for 166, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 382 – to pass 350 for only the third time so far this season. Then, David Harrison and Alex Wharf embarked on a 19th-century-like bowling effort – in that they did almost all of the bowling. The seam pairing bowled 33 of the 34 overs, sharing all ten wickets. Gloucestershire crashed to 66 for 8 before Steve Adshead and Jon Lewis added 67 for the ninth wicket, but Wharf had Adshead caught and bowled before bowling William Rudge with the next ball. Robert Croft did not opt to bat again, however, preferring to set a big target for Gloucestershire to chase.\nHowever, Gloucestershire bowled with more effect the second time around, Malinga Bandara taking four for 85 in a marathon 37-over spin bowling effort. Rudge repaired his golden duck, taking a wicket with his first ball of the innings to remove Mark Wallace for another golden duck. However, Rudge was taken for 36 in a six-over spell, and never returned to bowl. Dean Cosker top-scored for Glamorgan with 52 from number seven as they made their way to 290, setting Gloucestershire a target of 540 to win – which would have been a record run chase in first-class cricket. Ramnaresh Sarwan attempted it, hitting out well after Kadeer Ali had been dismissed, but he was eventually bowled by Huw Waters for 54. Gloucestershire succumbed to 184 for 5 at stumps, needing to survive another day for the draw. Wharf spoiled that, though, taking four wickets on the fourth morning as Gloucestershire crawled to 217 and a 322-run defeat.\nSeptember.\nSeptember yielded one victory in seven matches for Glamorgan, but as they were already relegated in the Championship and almost assured of staying up in the National League it mattered little. It began with an eight-wicket Championship loss and a League no-result with Northamptonshire, before they lost a Championship match inside two days against Sussex. Then followed two matches in the National League, a five-run loss to Middlesex first, before C&amp;G Trophy champions Hampshire were bowled out for 69, giving Glamorgan a 151-run victory. Their Championship season was rounded off on 18 September with another loss, their 14th of the season, and they also lost their final League match to Gloucestershire.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Nottinghamshire (30 August – 2 September).\nNottinghamshire (19pts) beat Glamorgan (3pts) by eight wickets\nGlamorgan went down to another loss the week after recording their first Championship win, as it took Nottinghamshire's bowlers 48 overs to wrap up their first innings after Glamorgan won the toss and batted. Glamorgan's number five Mike Powell made 62 as the only Glamorgan batsman to pass 25, but left-armer Greg Smith got him and three others out to finish with four for 28 off 17 overs. Glamorgan's final total was 151, and Nottinghamshire matched that for the loss of only two wickets at the close of the first day, despite losing opener Jason Gallian for a duck. On the second, only 33 overs of play were possible, but Nottinghamshire still added 80 before Darren Bicknell was dismissed for 123. The last seven partnerships mustered 52 runs – a quarter of what the first three partnerships had managed, as Robert Croft took three wickets and Dean Cosker four either side of stumps on the second day.\nNottinghamshire had accumulated a 132-run lead on first innings, and their bowlers took five wickets before the sixth-wicket pair of Powell and Alex Wharf doubled the total and more, adding 118 in three hours, as Glamorgan gave Nottinghamshire something to chase. Four wickets from Mark Ealham in the late hours of the third day's play, though, reduced Glamorgan to 290 for 9 at the close, and Wharf added 17 on the fourth morning with Huw Waters (who recorded an unbeaten 24-ball duck) before he was dismissed by Andrew Harris for 113, his highest first-class score. Wharf's century meant that Nottinghamshire's winning target was 176, and fifties from Gallian and Russell Warren carried Nottinghamshire past the target and onto the top of the Championship table with eight wickets in hand.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Northamptonshire (4 September).\nNo result; Glamorgan (2pts), Northamptonshire (2pts)\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks had set a target of 283 when rain intervened at Sophia Gardens. Having been put in to bat by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, they got themselves to 155 for 2 thanks to fifties from Usman Afzaal and David Sales, and to finish the innings off Bilal Shafayat and Riki Wessels recorded scores at run rates higher than six an over. Wessels spent 20 deliveries for his unbeaten 43, while Shafayat got a run-a-ball 31. For Glamorgan, Alex Wharf got three wickets, but conceded 71 runs from nine overs, while Andrew Davies was almost as expensive with 53 from eight overs, but took four wickets. Glamorgan saw off 33 balls from Northamptonshire in chase of 283 to win, losing Croft for 1 as they made their way to 22 for 1, but rain then put an end to play and Glamorgan took two points from the game.\nCounty Championship: Sussex v Glamorgan (7–8 September).\nSussex (20pts) beat Glamorgan (5pts) by nine wickets\nDavid Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan made their way to a relatively competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2. After a first day yielding 12 wickets, a further 19 went down on the second day, as Sussex took the victory to further extend the gap between the two sides. Sussex lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan lost their first three wickets for 22, before Dan Cherry and Mike Powell forged a half-century partnership for Glamorgan. Once again, the Pakistanis broke through, with Rana and Mushtaq sharing five wickets, four of them ducks, and Glamorgan went from 73–4 to 78–9. Opener Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 – Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex were set a target of 35, which they passed for the loss of Ward to end with a nine-wicket victory.\nNational League: Middlesex v Glamorgan (11 September).\nMiddlesex (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by five runs\nScott Styris conceded 56 runs with the ball for Middlesex Crusaders in this National League game, but his four wickets near the end cut short Glamorgan's chase to bring Middlesex to victory. The Crusaders had been inserted by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, against a Dragons side whose National League season had seen their best performances, as both Championship, Twenty20 and C&amp;G had seen them finish below ninth. After Ed Smith departed for 6, fifties from Paul Weekes and Owais Shah sent Middlesex to 133 for 1. Dean Cosker took two quick wickets, but 37 off 27 balls from left-hander Ed Joyce helped Middlesex to a total of 239 for 5. Peter Trego then removed both openers, before Alex Wharf took him for runs (ending with 40 off 20 balls), and Trego ended with one maiden over, two wickets, and 31 runs off three overs. Wharf was eventually caught by Smith, but David Hemp, Dan Cherry and Richard Grant all added more than 30 in stands with Mike Powell, and at 219 for 5, Glamorgan needed 21 for the last five wickets. Styris had the last laugh, however, taking three wickets in the late overs and bowling Glamorgan out with eight balls remaining in their quota to leave Powell stranded on 83 not out.\nNational League: Glamorgan v Hampshire (13 September).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 151 runs\nGlamorgan Dragons recorded a victory at their home ground Sophia Gardens, despite the bowling of Sean Ervine and Shaun Udal who took two wickets each and both conceded less than 40 runs. Wicket-keeper Mark Wallace hit one six and one four in an above-run-a-ball 32, while Mike Powell had set the pace with 52 from number four. Hampshire Hawks were then shot down in the chase. David Harrison had John Crawley caught with the second ball of the match, and Andrew Davies followed up, getting Greg Lamb and Ervine caught behind. With James Adams bowled by Harrison, Hampshire had scored seven runs for four wickets, and their lower order could not muster enough runs to chase the target of 221 to win. Jono McLean was the first to hit into double figures, before he too was caught behind off Davies, and Harrison then took two as Hampshire were 33 for 7. Kevin Latouf and Udal adjusted somewhat, adding 19 for the eighth wicket, but first-change bowler Alex Wharf cleaned them up as well, leaving Hampshire all out for 69 – the lowest score of the National League Division One all season, and giving Glamorgan the highest victory by runs in the division all season.\nCounty Championship: Glamorgan v Hampshire (15–18 September).\nHampshire (21pts) beat Glamorgan (4pts) by 75 runs\nThe first day of this match was rained off, and so Glamorgan's last match of the season was effectively reduced to a three-day one. They still lost, however, rounding off their Championship season with their 14th loss in 16 matches to cement their last place in the table. When the match got underway, the entire Hampshire batting order from one to eight made their way past 15, and an innings including half-centuries from James Adams, Jono McLean, Simon Katich and Dimitri Mascarenhas, saw them to a total of 350. Australia leg spinner Shane Warne hit three sixes in a 17-minute 24, while Glamorgan captain Robert Croft snared five wickets, but was also the second most expensive bowler by economy rate of the six used, conceding 103 runs in 25.4 overs.\nThe returning Shane Warne, fresh from taking 40 wickets in the 2005 Ashes series, took four for 50 in Glamorgan's innings, as Glamorgan faltered from 151 for 4 to 249 all out, and the third day's play ended with Simon Katich and Sean Ervine plundering runs in return. An opening stand of 117 was achieved quickly, and Warne then hit two sixes in a nine-ball 15, as Hampshire added 218 for 7 in 32 overs before declaring. Croft completed another five-wicket-haul, but still conceded 57 in ten overs (admittedly with an economy rate lower than the other bowlers). Set 320 to win, Glamorgan attempted the chase, hitting 44 in the first 40 minutes, and Croft led from the front with a well-paced 90. Once he was caught behind off Ervine, however, Glamorgan needed 94 for the last three wickets, and the lower order succumbed to the Zimbabwean Ervine. Wicket-keeper and number eight Mark Wallace was left not out on 33, as Glamorgan posted a total of 244, while Ervine finished with five for 60 in the second innings, his best bowling figures of the season thus far.\nNational League: Gloucestershire v Glamorgan (25 September).\nGloucestershire (4pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by three wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators made it past the target set by Glamorgan Dragons to take a victory in their final game of the season, but they were still relegated into Division Two, thus suffering relegation in both forms of cricket. Winning the toss and bowling first, Gloucestershire's spinners Malinga Bandara and Mark Hardinges shared four for 87 in their 18 overs after the opening bowlers Jon Lewis and James Averis went wicketless. Gloucestershire did concede 32 extras, however, as Glamorgan assembled 262 for 8. Steve Adshead and Kadeer Ali added 86 for Gloucestershire's first wicket, before Craig Spearman took on the Gloucestershire bowlers to hit 80 off 71 balls. Though he was dismissed with the total on 228, Bandara, Lewis and Mark Alleyne added the required runs, as Gloucestershire won with 14 balls to spare.\nStatistics.\nFirst-class cricket.\nMost runs.\n\"Qualification: 750 runs\"\nMost wickets.\n\"Qualification: 30 wickets\"\nList A cricket.\nMost runs.\n\"Qualification: 300 runs\"\nMost wickets.\n\"Qualification: 15 wickets\""

        "text": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 2005 are playing their cricket in Division Two of the County Championship and Division One of the totesport League. They started the season at 12–1 to win the Division Two title. During the off season 9 players left.\nThe season started with a thrashing dispensed to the students of Bradford/Leeds UCCE. Then they lost their first Sunday League match, a rain-affected affair against the Worcestershire Royals. The first Championship game was drawn against Leicestershire after Northants captain David Sales left the declaration too late. The second Sunday League match was won at Bristol, narrowly by 9 runs. Then they drew with Derbyshire in the Championship, before thrashing Hampshire on the Sunday.\nOn 3 May the Steelbacks booked their place in the second round of the C&amp;G Trophy, thrashing Denmark in Brøndby. They then lost by 10 wickets in the Championship to Yorkshire before drawing with Essex. In the fourth round of the Sunday League, they were thoroughly outplayed by Lancashire.\nOn 17 May they beat Middlesex in the second round of the C&amp;G Trophy, before looking on top but only getting a draw in a tour match against the Bangladeshis and losing to Somerset in the Championship despite scoring 408 in the first innings.\nThey drew their first match in June against Lancashire, before enduring a tough last-ball loss to Middlesex in the National League, and then drawing with league leaders Durham. Their first win in June came at home, beating Gloucestershire by five wickets in the National League, and they stretched that win streak to four, beating Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, both at home, before travelling to Worcestershire and winning that game too. With three initial victories, things looked promising for Northamptonshire in the Twenty20 Cup, and despite winning only one of their last five games – against Somerset at Taunton – they still finished top of the Midlands/Wales/West Division.\nHowever, that poor patch of form continued into the other competitions. Essex beat them twice, first in the National League and then in the County Championship, and then Northamptonshire had to bow out of both knock-out competitions – losing to Yorkshire in the C&amp;G Trophy before being defeated with two balls to spare by Somerset in the Twenty20 Cup. In the County Championship, Monty Panesar spun them to victory against Worcestershire, taking nine wickets. A no-result with Nottinghamshire sent them further adrift of Essex and Middlesex in the fight for the National League title.\nAugust started with two wins over Worcestershire – in the National League and the Championship – before going down by 64 runs to Lancashire in the National League. In the Championship, they beat Derbyshire by 182 runs, despite only having made 140 in the first innings of the match. They recovered from the National League loss against Lancashire, too, beating Middlesex by 14 runs on 15 August, but lost to Glamorgan in the same competition two days later. A two-day match with the touring Australians followed, Australia opting for batting practice instead of pushing home the victory. In the Championship, a bottom-of-the-table clash with Leicestershire ended in a draw, before they recorded a four-wicket win over Nottinghamshire in the National League and a 285-run Championship win over Lancashire.\nThey moved up to second place in the already decided National League with a no-result at Glamorgan, before drawing two successive Championship matches, with Somerset and Durham. Monty Panesar and Jason Brown then took ten wickets each in the final Championship game, which Northamptonshire won by an innings and 21 runs, before they rounded off their National League season with a loss to Essex.\nMatch details.\nNorthamptonshire v Bradford/Leeds UCCE (9–10 April).\nNorthamptonshire beat Bradford/Leeds UCCE by an innings and 62 runs\nThe first day of this game at Northampton saw Northamptonshire progress to 373 for 7 declared off only 69 overs. Kevin Innes top-scored with 80 off only 59 balls. The declaration left time for 23 more overs on the first day, in which Bradford/Leeds UCCE slumped to 60 for 5. The second day, Bradford/Leeds UCCE fared equally badly, being dismissed for 137. Northamptonshire chose to enforce the follow-on rather than opt for batting practice, and saw off Bradford/Leeds UCCE for 174 to win by an innings and 62 runs in two days. Spinners Monty Panesar and Jason Brown both got five wickets each in the match. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (17 April).\nWorcestershire (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 31 runs (D/L method)\nAt Northampton, Worcestershire Royals captain Vikram Solanki led from the front, scoring 119 off 137 balls, including 13 fours and 1 six. Support from his colleagues took the visitors up to 211 for 4 off their 45 overs. Worcestershire director of cricket Tom Moody said of Solanki: \"I can't see why he won't be in the mix for England section this summer. It depends how the selectors shuffle the deck, but I would imagine he will be in their minds for consideration at the very least. We were very confident he was ready for the challenge of captaincy and he has had a great start.\"\nWhen Northampstonshire Steelbacks batted, Australian Matt Mason took 3 for 20, to leave Northamptonshire on 137 for 7 off 32.5 overs when rain prevented further play. Worcestershire won easily on the Duckworth-Lewis method. /BBC scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Leicestershire (20–23 April).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Leicestershire (9pts)\nThe first day at Northampton saw only 26.2 overs, during which Northamptonshire progressed to 90 for no loss. On the second day Bilal Shafayat (59), Martin Love (50), David Sales (113), Damien Wright (95) and Gerard Brophy (52) all contributed with the bat, as the hosts moved to 433 for 6 declared. However, Northamptonshire bowled without luck, allowing Leicestershire to score 69 for 0 at close.\nOn the third day, Leicestershire progressed to 339 all out, with Darren Robinson scoring 100. However, the innings was controversial, with three debatable decisions going against the visitors. First Robinson was given out caught, when the ball probably hit his forearm. Then HD Ackerman was out leg before to a delivery that looked high. Then, at 220 for 5 Aftab Habib edged Jason Brown low to Martin Love at first slip. Habib thought it had not carried, and Love and one umpire were not sure. The other umpire said he was out, so off Habib went. But he returned to confront Shafayat who taunted Habib on the dismissal. Northamptonshire progressed to 45 for 0 at close.\nThe fourth day saw the game peter out to a draw, as a late declaration, with the score on 238 for 3, left Northamptonshire just less than two session to dismiss Leicestershire, who were set an unrealistic target of 333 to win in 58 overs. Leicestershire were 115 for 4 when the draw was agreed with 11 overs still available. (BBC scorecard)\nGloucestershire v Northamptonshire (24 April).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 9 runs\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks batted first at Bristol. Two quick wickets reduced them to 14 for 2. It was a slow pitch that was not conducive to a high score, but they made their way to 202 for 7 off their 45 overs, thanks in part to Damien Wright smashing three sixes in four balls in the penultimate over, and thanks to Gloucestershire Gladiators dropping three catches.\nIn reply Northamptonshire took wickets regularly leaving the hosts on 111 for 5. There was a recovery of sorts after that, led by Alex Gidman's 71, but the hosts were always on the back foot from there. Eventually they finished on 193 for 8, a deficit of 9 runs. Four Northamptonshire bowlers got two wickets each, Welshman Steffan Jones getting them for the fewest runs, as he conceded only 29. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nDerbyshire v Northamptonshire (27–30 April).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Derbyshire (6pts)\nNorthamptonshire batted first at Derby, and openers Bilal Shafayat and Martin Love took them to the sword, though Derbyshire dropped them both. Shafayat finished the first day unbeaten on a career-best 156 from 267 balls; Love was on 129 off 233 balls; Northants were on 292.\nShafayat added only 5 to his overnight score before being lbw, but Love went on to 168. Northamptonshire finally declared on 451 for 7. In reply, Derbyshire regularly lost wickets, finishing the second day on 135 for 4. On the third day, Johann Louw took 6 for 71 to force Derbyshire to follow on 210 in arrears. However, Derbyshire fared much better in their second innings – with both openers undefeated and their score on 119, 91 behind with one day to play. Rain then wiped out the final day's play. (BBC scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Hampshire (1 May).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 98 runs\nAt Northampton, Northamptonshire Steelbacks' Bilal Shafayat struck a career-best 74 from 82 balls as Northants stormed to 266 for 9. Shafayat was dropped on 11 and 56, but congratulated by Hampshire captain, Shane Warne, who was taken for 53 in nine overs. Hampshire fell to 44 for 4 in reply and, despite 42 from Shaun Udal batting number eight, were never in the game as the Hawks were all out for 168. Northamptonshire seamer Ben Phillips took his second List A four-wicket-haul, removing Kevin Pietersen, John Crawley, Warne and Chris Tremlett on his way to four for 48. (BBC scorecard)\nDenmark v Northamptonshire (3 May).\nNorthamptonshire beat Denmark by 8 wickets to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nNorthamptonshire's Charl Pietersen took 7 for 10 at Brøndby as Denmark fell to the competition's second lowest score in its history, for 56 all out. 24 of those runs were extras, with no Dane scoring more than 8 with the bat. Pietersen, who was playing in his debut match for the Northants first team said, \"The ball was swinging about and they were perfect conditions for bowling. I just concentrated on getting the ball in the right areas and the conditions did the rest. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've been given by Northants. I'm here to learn and try to get myself in the first team on a regular basis. No cricketer wants to play second-team cricket and I'm no different. But one performance won't get me in, I've got to be consistent with my wicket-taking and my economy.\"\nIt took Northamptonshire one ball less than 17 overs to make 59 for 2 to win the match just before lunch as the Danes were humbled. Afterwards the Danish coach said, \"We knew it was going to be difficult. We are short of money but we are trying to develop every time we play against different opposition. We have a lot of young players and it was good for them to test themselves against the professionals.\" (BBC scorecard)\nYorkshire v Northamptonshire (6–9 May).\nYorkshire (20pts) beat Northamptonshire (5pts) by 10 wickets\nNorthamptonshire were dismissed for 281 on the first day at Headingley, with Deon Kruis taking 5 for 59. It was a recovery of sorts, as Ben Phillips and Johann Louw put on 95 for the eighth wicket, but Anthony McGrath ended the visitors' resistance with three wickets. Yorkshire were 30 for 0 in reply at the end of the first day. Phil Jaques dominated the second day, with his 176, which helped Yorkshire to an all out total of 328, a small lead of 47. His fellow Australian Damien Wright recorded what turned out to be Northamptonshire's best bowling figures, ending with eight for 60. Northants were 9 for 0 at stumps on the second day.\nOn the third day, ten-man Northamptonshire capitulated. They lost their first wicket without a run being added, and never really got going, being 115 for 7 at close on the third day, and being dismissed for 175 and setting a target of 129 on the fourth. It was clear they were not going to win, and Yorkshire gave them no chances, winning by 10 wickets. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Essex (11–14 May).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Essex (6pts)\nAt Northampton the home side batted first. Bilal Shafayat (153) and Usman Afzaal (168) scored two huge centuries to help Northamptonshire to 552 for 7 declared. When Essex finally got to bat, it was a different story, with the batsmen, particularly the tail, struggling. Johann Louw took 6 for 51, as Essex subsided to 178. The follow-on was enforced, and from then on the bat dominated again. Alastair Cook made a career-best 195 in 513 minutes, supported by Zimbabwean Andy Flower, who made 142 not out, as Essex eased to the draw at 495 for 6 declared. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLancashire v Northamptonshire (15 May).\nLancashire (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by seven wickets\nLancashire Lightning eased to a comfortable win against Northamptonshire Steelbacks to go third in the table, two points behind leaders Middlesex Crusaders. Northamptonshire won the toss and batted, but 215 for 7 was never going to be enough on a fine Old Trafford pitch, where Lancashire's Mal Loye smashed 94 not out with ten fours and three sixes. There were good news for England fans as well – Test all-rounder Andrew Flintoff bowled 9 overs for Lancashire without complain from his recently operated ankle, taking the wicket of England prospect Bilal Shafayat in the process.\nMiddlesex v Northamptonshire (17 May).\nNorthamptonshire beat Middlesex by 19 runs to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nNorthamptonshire batted first at Lord's. Their top order performed well, with Usman Afzaal making 75 off 120 balls, and useful contributions from Bilal Shafayat (46) and David Sales (40). However, once they were out, 7 wickets fell for 40 runs, leaving them on 215 for 9, before Robert White smacked 36 to lift the visitors to 238. Middlesex got off to a good start, reaching 148 for 2 and 168 for 3, as opener Paul Weekes scored a century. However, then Damien Wright took 4 wickets for 1 in 7 balls, as Middlesex collapsed in more spectacular fashion than the visitors, losing their last 6 wickets for 8 runs. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Bangladeshis (20–22 May).\nNorthamptonshire drew with the Bangladeshis\nOn the first day at Northampton, Northamptonshire made 149 for 5 against the touring Bangladeshis. The tourists' bowlers lured the county batsmen into playing odd strokes to loose balls, but not Bilal Shafayat, who made 76 before mistiming one off left-arm spinner Enamul Haque. However, it was Anwar Hossain Monir who did the most damage, taking 3 for 67. The second day was wiped out by rain, which resulted in the third day becoming somewhat pointless – Anwar added the wicket of Matthew Friedlander to his tally as he finished with four for 113, while the Bangladeshis lost wickets quickly in their reply, crumbling to 105 for 5. However, 16-year-old prodigy Mushfiqur Rahim continued his good run of form, scoring 115 not out with fifteen fours and a six to lift the Bangladeshis to 309 for 7 in their glorified nets session.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (25–27 May).\nSomerset (21 pts) beat Northamptonshire (8 pts) by six wickets\nSomerset won the toss at Northampton and chose to bowl – and although they got the hosts Northamptonshire out in a day, Martin Love (166) and wicketkeeper Riki Wessels (son of Kepler) (102) made quick centuries to lift the hosts to 408. Conversely, however, two Northamptonshire batsmen batting at 4 and 5 perished for ducks to Richard Johnson. Somerset replied well, though, with 53 from opener Matthew Wood, but rash strokes gave wickets around everywhere as Somerset made 356 – admittedly only 52 behind. Off-spinner Jason Brown got six wickets for 112, just as many as he had taken before this game, while Ian Blackwell played a typical 59 off 77 balls.\nNorthamptonshire lost the wicket of Bilal Shafayat in their eight overs before stumps on day two but could still be reasonably pleased with the first two days' play. However, on the third day, their side collapsed with Gareth Andrew taking three for 31 as they crashed to 100 all out – Ian Blackwell removing two in his only over, which was also a maiden. In chasing 155, Somerset had some problems in tackling the bowling of Johann Louw, who took two wickets, but still managed a relatively comfortable six-wicket win.\nHampshire v Northamptonshire (30 May).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by four wickets\nHampshire Hawks batted first at The Rose Bowl, and despite an unbeaten 100 from Greg Lamb – the first of his List A career – Hampshire were tied down to 226 for 7 off their 45 overs, mainly thanks to three for 30 from Australian Damien Wright. Six wides from Chris Tremlett, who conceded 51 runs off his eight overs then cost Hampshire the game after Shaun Udal had taken three wickets to set Northamptonshire Steelbacks back to 135 for 5. David Sales added 49 with Wright before Ben Phillips guided Northamptonshire to four points with 26 off 12 balls and secured a win with ten balls to spare.\nLancashire v Northamptonshire (1–4 June).\nLancashire (7pts) drew with Northamptonshire (7pts)\nThere was no play on the first day at Old Trafford because of rain. The weather on the second day allowed only 54 overs, and in that time Northamptonshire made 148 for 5. They were all out for 175 on the third day, after James Anderson took 3 and Muttiah Muralitharan 4 wickets. Lancashire fared worse in reply, slumping to 27 for 5 and 35 for 6, before recovering slightly to 149 all out thanks to 48 from veteran wicket-keeper Warren Hegg. Northants lost 2 quick wickets in their second innings, before ending the third day on 94 for 3. This left a small chance of victory on the final day, but it wasn't to happen. Muralitharan took 4 quick wickets, but the visitors still made 225, a target of 252 runs. Lancashire were saved by captain Mark Chilton who kept his wicket as all about were losing theirs. The opener finished on 113 not out, as Lancashire saved the match ending on 188 for 8. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNorthamptonshire v Middlesex (12 June).\nMiddlesex (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 2 wickets\nIn a close match at The County Ground, Northampton, Middlesex stole a victory thanks to intelligent running from Melvyn Betts and big scores from Jamie Dalrymple, who made a run-a-ball 76, and Irishman Ed Joyce who made 74 off 78 balls. Earlier, Australian overseas player Martin Love (111 not out) and Usman Afzaal (122 not out) had occupied the crease for Northamptonshire, sharing a 227-run partnership as the hosts made 283 for 1. In the end, however, Betts scampered the winning three on the last delivery, and stole victory from the jaws of defeat.\nNorthamptonshire v Durham (15–18 June).\nDurham (10pts) drew with Northamptonshire (8pts)\nNeither team really attempted to win this game at The County Ground, Northampton, which wasn't as badly hit by rain as many other games in that week. Batting first, Durham made 334 from a tricky position at 73 for 4, Northamptonshire bowler Damien Wright trailing off after three early wickets, and a seventh-wicket partnership between Ashley Noffke and Phil Mustard for 135 lifted Durham out of a tricky position. Dale Benkenstein got four cheap wickets for 29 in the Northamptonshire effort, while David Sales top-scored with 50 not out, but Durham looked on top. However, going at only three an over, Durham didn't ram home the advantage, captain Benkenstein choosing to boost his own average with 83 not out. Thus, Northamptonshire were set 414 in 70 overs – a ridiculous task – and despite two wickets from Gareth Breese, both teams were content with the draw.\nNorthamptonshire v Gloucestershire (19 June).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by five wickets\nGloucestershire Gladiators and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks were both forced to win this relegation clash, the last one-day game these sides would play before the Twenty20 Cup began. Winning the toss and batting, Gloucestershire crumbled from 53 for 0 to 55 for 4 in a collapse very reminiscent of what happened at their home ground on that same day in the England vs Australia game, but 63 from Mark Hardinges rescued them to a competitive total of 215 for 9. Bilal Shafayat and Tim Roberts looked to secure the victory, pairing up for 166 for the first wicket, but two wickets from Martyn Ball and two run-outs saw a collapse to 207 for 5. Shafayat, however, kept his cool, seeing the hosts to the target with ten balls to spare.\nNorthamptonshire v Gloucestershire (22 June).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 81 runs\nThe Gloucestershire Gladiators took a massive beating by the Northamptonshire Steelbacks in their match at Milton Keynes. Despite Gloucestershire's Martyn Ball taking two for 18 from four overs, positively economical, five no-balls and the fact that 16 overs had to be found from bowlers other than Ball allowed Northamptonshire to run away to 224 for 5 – a Twenty20 Cup record . David Sales top-scored for the hosts with 78 not out, while Australian Damien Wright paired up with him for 84 for the sixth wicket, scoring an unbeaten 38 of his own. Gloucestershire were in trouble from the start, as opening batsman Craig Spearman was run out for a duck, and when Wright ripped out two more wickets, the Gladiators were 10 for three. Four wickets from Ben Phillips resulted in a serious collapse, as Gloucestershire were all out for 143.\nNorthamptonshire v Warwickshire (24 June).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by 38 runs\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks took their second victory from two Twenty20 Cup matches thus far, as they accumulated 143 for 5 in 14 overs, despite no batsman hitting more than 40 in a rain-shortened match at Northampton. Scotsman Dougie Brown took one for nine off three overs for Warwickshire Bears, but the target was too large for the visitors, as Northamptonshire bowler Ben Phillips removed four Warwickshire lower-order batsmen – his second four-wicket-haul in three days – as the Bears crumbled to 105 for 9.\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (27 June).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 37 runs\nDavid Sales (59 runs) and Usman Afzaal (46) lifted Northamptonshire Steelbacks to a very competitive total of 180 for 6 at New Road, where Shoaib Akhtar bowled a maiden over but was smashed for thirty-three runs in the other three overs he bowled. The hosts' innings saw Worcestershire Royals lose Graeme Hick early on, and despite 53 from Stephen Moore, Northamptonshire's bowlers had a good grip on the Worcestershire players – Johann Louw got the best figures for the Steelbacks with three for 25 – and Worcestershire finished on 143 for 8.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (29 June).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nAt Northampton, Andy Caddick served up an unusually economical spell, taking two for 12 in three overs despite two wides. That helped tie the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks down to 95 for 6 in 12 overs in the rain-shortened game, and with Graeme Smith and Keith Parsons at the crease and the score 55 for 1, things looked bright for Somerset Sabres. Two wickets from Jason Brown helped put the odds for a Northamptonshire win down, but Somerset prevailed, Parsons hitting the winning runs on the last ball as Somerset finished on 97 for 5.\nGlamorgan v Northamptonshire (1 July).\nMatch abandoned without a ball bowled; Glamorgan (1pt), Northamptonshire (1pt)\nThe weather at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff prevented a match from getting underway between Glamorgan Dragons and Northamptonshire Steelbacks.\nSomerset v Northamptonshire (2 July).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by five wickets\nDespite Graeme Smith making a 53-ball century, and pairing up with Matthew Wood for 129 for the first wicket, Somerset Sabres still lost the match at Taunton. Smith's 105 helped Somerset set a target of 190, but none of the bowlers conceded less than seven an over to Northamptonshire Steelbacks' batting. Simon Francis was the worst, ending with 57 conceded runs in four overs, while Riki Wessels hit 49 not out with four sixes off 22 balls, and the Sabres had to see that Northamptonshire won with an over to spare.\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (5 July).\nMatch abandoned; Northamptonshire (1pt), Worcestershire (1pt)\nNo play was possible at The County Ground, Northampton due to rain, and the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks qualified for the quarter-finals thanks to the no-result.\nWarwickshire v Northamptonshire (6 July).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 41 runs\nWarwickshire Bears were lifted to a total of 205 for 2 by hitting eight sixes at Edgbaston, Ian Bell carrying his side with 66 not out off just 38 balls. Nick Knight also made 61 as Northamptonshire Steelbacks failed to make any impact with the ball. The Northamptonshire reply was stifled by some reasonably economical bowling, with no regular bowler conceding more than eight an over, and good fielding which yielded one run out and stopped the boundaries. Warwickshire seamer Jamie Anyon took three for 34, for his second successive match with a three-wicket haul, while Usman Afzaal became top scorer with a run-a-ball 43. Ben Phillips hit 41 not out from number four to complement his bowling figures of two for 43. In the end, Northamptonshire made 164 for 6, but still went through – along with Warwickshire, who finished second in their group thanks to their win over Somerset two days earlier.\nEssex v Northamptonshire (8 July).\nEssex (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nEssex Eagles recorded their seventh win in eight attempts in the National League, cementing their place at the top. After Northamptonshire Steelbacks won the toss and batted at Chelmsford, three run-outs and Grant Flower's bowling, which yielded three for 21, saw them go from 185 for 5 to 200 all out. Essex's reply was secured by a healthy 90 not out from Flower after Essex had struggled initially, being 95 for 4. 29 not out from Dutch-South African Ryan ten Doeschate sent them past the target with ten balls to spare.\nEssex v Northamptonshire (10–13 July).\nEssex (22pts) beat Northamptonshire (3pts) by ten wickets\nEssex won a spin-dominated match at Chelmsford. Batting first, Essex made 506 against Northamptonshire – whose normally astute spin attack was batted out of the game. Monty Panesar took a career best seven-wicket-haul in the innings, but conceded 181 runs in the process, bowling a mammoth 56.3 overs. The Northamptonshire reply was stifled by four wickets from James Middlebrook, as they crumbled to 141 for 6, but Ben Phillips and Damien Wright added 95 for the seventh wicket before Tony Palladino grabbed three wickets in four balls, and they finished on 247. Following on, Northamptonshire had made 203 for 2 when Essex' captain Ronnie Irani brought Alastair Cook on as seventh-bowler. The off-spinner, normally an opening batsmen, claimed his three first first-class wickets as three wickets fell for five runs, and Danish Kaneria wrapped up the rest of Northamptonshire's batsmen as they bowed out for 261. Chasing a target of 3, William Jefferson hit a four with the second ball of Essex' innings, thus ending the game.\nYorkshire v Northamptonshire (16 July).\nYorkshire beat Northamptonshire by 33 runs to progress to the Semi-Final of the C&amp;G Trophy\nMichael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in the fourth quarter-final of the C&amp;G Trophy. It was a bit of an implosion from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, but it was too little, too late.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (18 July).\nSomerset beat Northamptonshire by four wickets to progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks failed to take full use of their home advantage, and Somerset Sabres escaped with a four-wicket win to reach their first semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup. Northamptonshire's batsmen made quick scores between 20 and 30, but Ian Blackwell's spell mid-match of three for 16 pegged Northamptonshire back to 118 for 6. Ben Phillips then made an unbeaten 27 to lift his team to 154 for 8, however, but he couldn't take a wicket while bowling. Despite three run-outs, Somerset made it through on the penultimate ball, as Matthew Wood recorded 58 and Blackwell a 16-ball 31 to lay the foundation before Keith Parsons set the pace late on with an unbeaten 38.\nNorthamptonshire v Worcestershire (20–23 July).\nNorthamptonshire (19pts) beat Worcestershire (6.5pts) by 82 runs\nWorcestershire's fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar had a field day despite serving up no balls on the first day at Northampton, but that was only the first day, and Northamptonshire came back to win the game. The match had started well enough for the hosts Northamptonshire, but a menacing spell from the Pakistani fast bowler reduced them from 150 for 2 to 173 for 8 – Matt Mason helping out with two wickets as well. Shoaib finished with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls – while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62. Young wicket-keeper Steve Davies then made a career-best 95 in his sixth first-class game, which helped lift Worcestershire to 381, a lead of 82.\nNorthamptonshire lost six wickets to spinners in their second innings, Ray Price and Gareth Batty taking three each while Shoaib was expensive, conceding 67 in thirteen overs, as Northamptonshire were bowled out for 364 – Bilal Shafayat making 84 and Riki Wessels 102. Chasing 283 to win, Worcestershire got off to a good start with an opening partnership of 54, but Northamptonshire's spinner Monty Panesar took three for 47 to leave them 139 for 5 overnight, Ben Smith unbeaten on 50. Smith only added seven to that score, while Panesar took three more wickets, bowling 26.5 overs in one straight spell which yielded six for 77. Johann Louw and Brown also got one wicket each, as Worcestershire succumbed for 200 to suffer their third successive Championship loss, which sent them out of the promotion zone. Worcestershire were also deducted half a point for a slow over rate.\nNottinghamshire v Northamptonshire (24 July).\nNo result; Nottinghamshire (2pts), Northamptonshire (2pts)\nOnly 26 deliveries were bowled at Trent Bridge by Greg Smith and Mark Ealham of the Nottinghamshire Outlaws, who conceded 20 runs to Martin Love as Northamptonshire Steelbacks moved to 25 for 0 before rain stopped the game for good.\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (2 August).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 38 runs\nUsman Afzaal scored 117 off just 103 balls as Northamptonshire Steelbacks ploughed their way to 275 for 4, Afzaal pairing up with Martin Love for the second wicket for a partnership that was worth 155 runs. The Royals' innings struggled from the outset, when Stephen Moore was dismissed for a duck, and despite 52 from Graeme Hick, Worcestershire imploded to 185 for 9 at one point, with Bilal Shafayat taking four for 33 with medium-pace bowling. In the final overs, Shoaib Akhtar had some hitting fun at the end, scoring 36 off 17 balls in vain as Worcestershire ended on 237 for 9.\nWorcestershire v Northamptonshire (4–7 August).\nNorthamptonshire (17pts) beat Worcestershire (3pts) by 137 runs\nWorcestershire gave away the initiative in the second innings, losing by 137 runs thanks to a frantic second-innings 190 from David Sales. It was the visitors, Northamptonshire, who chose to bat first at New Road, and after seeing off Shoaib Akhtar and Kabir Ali in a frantic opening spell where Bilal Shafayat went for 1, Northamptonshire looked fairly confident at 177 for 4. Then Shoaib returned, taking four wickets (to end with bowling figures of 9.2–1–55–5), and the wheels fell off as Northamptonshire lost their last six wickets for 12 runs. Stephen Moore continued his fine form, making 62, as Worcestershire looked to gain a slender lead – Ben Phillips taking a couple of wickets to give Northamptonshire some hope of tying the hosts down. Then, Damien Wright ripped through with some quick wickets, as Worcestershire went from 110 for 3 to 147 for 8 – only for Shoaib and Matthew Mason to give Worcestershire the lead thanks to a boundary-filled 47-run partnership.\nAli and Mason then chipped away at the Northamptonshire batsmen, and would have fancied their chances when the visitors were 64 for 5. However, a quickfire partnership between Sales and Wright turned the match on its head again, as the pair added 188 runs in 112 minutes – one run less than Northamptonshire had managed in the entire first innings – to send Northamptonshire into a relatively big lead on this pitch. Sales was 152 not out overnight, and powered on to 190 before Malik had him caught. However, the damage was done, and Worcestershire faced a steep target of 360 to win – or five sessions for a draw. Losing Moore and Graeme Hick early on, Ben Smith attacked for a fine 92, and a 45-minute flurry of runs from Zander de Bruyn gave Worcestershire some hope at 154 for 3. However, Monty Panesar got four for 40, Phillips dug out three for 56, Worcestershire lost the last seven wickets for 68 runs, and whimpered into a heap. Worcestershire were later deducted one point due to a slow over rate.\nNorthamptonshire v Lancashire (8 August).\nLancashire (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by 64 runs\nDespite four for 39 from Johann Louw, Lancashire Lightning recovered well from an early position of 52 for 3 against Northamptonshire Steelbacks. 80 from Andrew Symonds, a quick 44 from Dominic Cork and a captain's innings of 36 from Mark Chilton, took the score to 236 for 9. James Anderson, the former England ODI player, took three quick wickets to leave Northamptonshire struggling at 35 for 4, and from then on, it only went downwards for the Steelbacks. Andrew Crook wrapped up the innings with three cheap lower order wickets, and Northamptonshire crumbled to 172 all out.\nNorthamptonshire v Derbyshire (10–13 August).\nNorthamptonshire (17pts) beat Derbyshire (4pts) by 182 runs\nNorthamptonshire won the match at The County Ground, Northampton despite only posting 140 all out in the first innings. Derbyshire's medium-pacer Ian Hunter took four for 50 to get the best figures for Derbyshire, dismissing three Northamptonshire batsmen were dismissed in single figures. Graeme Welch chipped in with economical bowling, conceding only 21 runs in ten overs and claiming three scalps. Steve Stubbings and Michael di Venuto then made batting look easy with an opening partnership of 81, but two wickets from Johann Louw evened out the game somewhat, and Monty Panesar wrapped up Derbyshire's innings with three wickets on the second day, as Derbyshire were all out for 219.\nAfter Welch's bowling had yielded two early catches to see Northamptonshire to 43 for 2, Australian Martin Love took centre stage. He slashed 34 fours to end the second day unbeaten on 159, an innings higher than the entire Northamptonshire first innings total, and the hosts closed the second day's play on 311 for 3, Usman Afzaal having added 59 from number four as well. Love added only 18 before he was lbw to Mohamed Sheikh, but half-centuries from David Sales and Riki Wessels, ensured that Northamptonshire could declare with a lead of 388, giving themselves five sessions to win the game. The weather forecast for the final day, however, had predicted rain, so Northamptonshire wanted to get in early. Spinners Jason Brown and Monty Panesar shared nine wickets, as Derbyshire battled out the third day to 204 for 9, but Australian Damien Wright wrapped up the innings by having Hunter bowled two balls into the fourth morning.\nMiddlesex v Northamptonshire (15 August).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Middlesex (0pts) by 14 runs\nMiddlesex Crusaders waved a definite good-bye to their hopes of a National League title, losing their second game in a row and failing to take advantage of Essex Eagles' loss the preceding day. Martin Love and Robert White slashed fifties for an opening partnership of 117, and after two wickets from Chris Peploe, Bilal Shafayat entered. Taking a fancy to young medium-pacer Chris Wright, the 21-year-old slashed five sixes and seven fours to make 85 not out – only his fourth fifty in List A cricket. Middlesex' reply was led by Paul Weekes and Ed Smith – the pair started brightly, making 105 for the first wicket, but following Smith's departure only one batsman passed 20, and Middlesex failed to keep up with the required run rate to finish on 247 for 9, despite 111 from Weekes.\nNorthamptonshire v Glamorgan (17 August).\nGlamorgan (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nGlamorgan Dragons' bowler David Harrison bowled a fierce spell which only conceded 17 runs in nine overs – including five runs to extras – as Glamorgan limited the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks to 201 all out at Sophia Gardens. Northamptonshire's Riki Wessels hit 80 off 72 balls to take the score past 200 before lofting the ball to David Cherry to be last out. However, his 54-run partnership with Johann Louw gave Northamptonshire some hope of posing a challenge. Wickets fell with reasonable regularity, but captain Robert Croft refused to be dismissed, and his 81 not out anchored the chase. Richard Grant scored 22 not out as well, as Glamorgan made it to the target with 20 deliveries to spare, despite two wickets from Bilal Shafayat.\nNorthamptonshire v Australia (20–21 August).\nMatch drawn\nAustralia scored more than four times as many runs for each wicket as their hosts Northamptonshire at Northampton, yet the two-day time limit and Australia's hunger for batting practice ensured a draw. Northamptonshire won the toss, and put their guests in to bat, and Steffan Jones got two early breakthroughs as Australia were set back to 69 for 3 – Damien Martyn having spent only 14 minutes at the crease for his 26 – but Matthew Hayden and Michael Clarke spent good time in the middle making their centuries. The Australians declared on 374 for 6, and immediately dug into the Northamptonshire batsmen, who were effectively reduced to 48 for 5 when Tim Roberts retired hurt for 18. Glenn McGrath only bowled 11 overs, but used his time well, taking three for 24, while Shaun Tait and Brett Lee also got among the wickets with two each. Northamptonshire were bowled out for 169, and Australia opted to bat again, Simon Katich and Justin Langer both making half-centuries before the final day's play ended and the game was drawn. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLeicestershire v Northamptonshire (24–27 August).\nLeicestershire (12pts) drew with Northamptonshire (8pts)\nLeicestershire's first innings lasted three days, in which time they scored 390 runs for the loss of six wickets. The rain meant that only 119 overs were possible in three days. Leicestershire declared 22 balls into the fourth morning after getting 400, and spent the rest of the last day bowling Northamptonshire out for 261, Claude Henderson taking a season-best five for 63. With only one completed innings for each side, the match ended in a draw.\nNorthamptonshire v Nottinghamshire (28 August).\nNorthamptonshire (4pts) beat Nottinghamshire (0pts) by four wickets\nDespite Northamptonshire Steelbacks conceding 28 extras, Johann Louw the main culprit by bowling six wides, they still managed to bowl their opponents Nottinghamshire Outlaws out for 207 at The County Ground, Northampton. Louw made up for his inaccurate line by taking three wickets, including top scorer Chris Read, while Australian Damien Wright grabbed five wickets for 37 runs. That was Wright's first National League five-for of the season, and he brought his seasonal wicket-tally to 23, the most in the division at the time. When Nottinghamshire were in the field, part-time leg spinner Younis Khan took three wickets, but it didn't help, as Ben Phillips and Riki Wessels took Northamptonshire home with four wickets and five balls to spare, building on the efforts of Australian Martin Love who had made 59 from number one.\nNorthamptonshire v Lancashire (30 August-2 September).\nNorthamptonshire (19pts) beat Lancashire (6pts) by 285 runs\nNorthamptonshire recorded their fourth win of the season thanks to their top order batting and their spin bowling. They had won the toss and batted, placing themselves well at 224 for 4, but the last six wickets yielded only 63 runs, and Lancashire seamer Dominic Cork could take three late wickets to end with four for 27. Northamptonshire were bowled out early on the second morning for 289, but immediately hit back, Damien Wright dismissing Lancashire's captain Mark Chilton for 0. In a bowling effort dominated by spinners – Jason Brown and Monty Panesar sharing 68 of the 94 overs bowled – Northamptonshire tugged away, and but for Stuart Law's 111, the hosts might have got a first innings lead. However, it was Lancashire who got a lead of 12, with Brown taking five for 113 from 36.3 overs.\nJames Anderson then took two early wickets, leading to a long bowling effort for him – he bowled 28 overs, but could not add to his wicket tally, while Usman Afzaal ran away to 147, adding 183 with Bilal Shafayat. Northamptonshire declared eight overs into the last day, with the score 400 for 6 to unleash their spinners on Lancashire's batting line-up – and they did so very successfully. Brown got his second five-for of the match, ending with match figures of ten for 135, and Monty Panesar also got three wickets as Lancashire collapsed in a heap for 103 – with only Chilton passing 20, in a reversal of fortunes from the first innings.\nGlamorgan v Northamptonshire (4 September).\nNo result; Glamorgan (2pts), Northamptonshire (2pts)\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks had set an above-average target of 283 when rain intervened at Sophia Gardens. Having been put in to bat by Glamorgan Dragons' captain Robert Croft, they got themselves to 155 for 2 thanks to fifties from Usman Afzaal and David Sales, and to finish the innings off Bilal Shafayat and Riki Wessels unleashed themselves with quick knocks. Wessels only spent 20 deliveries for his unbeaten 43, while Shafayat got a run-a-ball 31. For Glamorgan, Alex Wharf got three wickets, but conceded 71 runs from nine overs, while Andrew Davies was almost as expensive with 53 in eight, but took four wickets. Glamorgan saw off 33 balls from Northamptonshire in chase of 283 to win, losing Croft for 1 as they made their way to 22 for 1, but rain then put an end to play and Glamorgan escaped with two points.\nSomerset v Northamptonshire (7–10 September).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Somerset (10pts)\nIan Blackwell and Arul Suppiah made scores of 98 and 91 respectively, as Somerset made their way to 396 batting first at Taunton, although the lower order struggled against the spin of Monty Panesar – who dug out Richard Johnson and Charl Langeveldt for ducks. Matthew Wood set the pace, adding 63 with James Francis in an opening partnership where Francis only contributed 8 before he was lbw to Steven Crook, who had changed counties from Lancashire to Northamptonshire. That was Crook's only wicket of the match, however, as he finished with match figures of 25–2–107–1.\nNorthamptonshire got off to a bad start, losing the first three wickets for 76 runs, but centuries from Usman Afzaal, who made 112, and David Sales, ending on 154 before being caught and bowled by Richard Johnson, lifted them back with a 175-run stand for the fourth wicket. Fifties from all-rounders Damien Wright (who added 131 with Sales for the sixth wicket), Simon Crook and Johann Louw lifted Northamptonshire to 574. Then, Wright took two wickets and Somerset fell to four runs for two wickets. Francis made his second half-century and James Hildreth also scored 50, however, leaving Somerset at 163 for 4 at stumps on day three. The match was intriguingly poised, but rain ruined a potentially interesting finish, as no play was possible on day four and the match was drawn.\nDurham v Northamptonshire (14–17 September).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Durham (8pts)\nDurham needed a draw in this match to secure promotion from Division Two of the County Championship, and the weather handed it to them, as only 222 overs of play were possible over four days. Northamptonshire went for the victory, declaring both their innings closed, but Durham hung on and escaped with eight points. Centuries from Usman Afzaal and Riki Wessels, along with 84 from Robert White lifted the visitors to 414 for 7 on the first day, despite Durham pacer Liam Plunkett grabbing five for 84 and after the second day was washed out they declared.\nNorthamptonshire broke through immediately, Damien Wright dismissing Jimmy Maher lbw for 0, and Wright got a further three wickets as Durham were 115 for 6 at one point. Gareth Breese and Plunkett saw out the remainder of the day, though, but Durham still needed 93 to avoid the follow on. Andrew Crook eventually broke the partnership, as Durham lost three wickets for 15 runs to go to 224 for 9, but resistance from Brad Williams saw him add 56 from number 11 with Breese to take Durham six runs past the follow-on target of 264. Northamptonshire set about making quick runs, and lost a bucketful of wickets, Callum Thorp taking three for ten as the visitors declared on 101 for 7 after 21 overs. Northamptonshire set Durham 246 to win, and got a good start when Damien Wright had Jimmy Maher bowled for 2, but Durham battled out 15 overs before rain set in and forced the game into a draw.\nNorthamptonshire v Yorkshire (21–24 September).\nNorthamptonshire (21pts) beat Yorkshire (3pts) by an innings and 21 runs\nNorthamptonshire spinners Jason Brown and Monty Panesar shared all ten Yorkshire wickets on the first day at Northampton. Yorkshire had won the toss and recorded a 66-run opening stand when the spinners first broke through, Panesar having Matthew Wood caught by Robin White. The rest was one of classic spin bowling – few runs and the occasional wicket – Panesar conceded just over one run an over (ending with figures of 27.5–11–32–5), and the average run rate for the innings was just above two. Former England all-rounder Craig White added 51 as Yorkshire were bowled out for 177. Early wickets from Deon Kruis reduced Northamptonshire to 34 for 2, but a three-hour stand of 220 across two days between Martin Love and Usman Afzaal took Northamptonshire to a lead of 77 with seven wickets in hand when Love fell for 95. Afzaal pushed on, making 157 before being dismissed by Kruis – who took five for 75 – and a 76-run partnership between Simon Crook and Panesar took Northamptonshire to 476 for 9 before the declaration came. Crook fell three short of a maiden first-class century, while Yorkshire leg spinner Mark Lawson was taken for 150 in 30 overs.\nYorkshire's scoring rate was, again, slow, and their second innings yielded 278 runs in nearly nine hours – though it was also frequently interrupted by rain. Panesar took the first five wickets, and despite partnerships of 50 for the seventh and eight wicket, Brown ended Yorkshire's innings with five of his own. The two spinners bowled 96.5 overs out of a total of 109.5 overs served up by Northamptonshire bowlers in the second innings, and ended with uncannily similar second-innings bowling analyses: Brown 50.5–14–95–5, Panesar 46–15–96–5. Brown and Panesar also split the 20 wickets equally between them – the second time in the history of the first-class game that this feat had occurred, and the first in 100 years. \nNorthamptonshire v Essex (25 September).\nEssex (4pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by seven wickets\nEssex Eagles took their thirteenth win in sixteen matches to round off their one-day season and end with a 16-point victory overall. Their bowlers built the foundation for this victory, as all seven bowlers to be used got at least one wicket, and despite half-centuries from Australians Martin Love and Damien Wright Northamptonshire Steelbacks were bowled out for 208. Wright then took two wickets to set Essex back to 22 for 2, but Alastair Cook then followed his 117 not out against Worcestershire in the County Championship earlier on in the week. His 110-ball 94 – a career best List A score, improving his previous best by 32 runs – was part of a 168-run stand with Grant Flower, which took Essex to the brink, with 190 for 3. Flower then hit the remaining 19 runs with Ravinder Bopara, and Essex won with seven wickets and 25 balls in hand."

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 2005",
        "text": "Somerset County Cricket Club played in Division Two of both the County Championship and the Sunday League in 2005. Somerset started at 10–1 to finish Division Two County Champions. Batting seems strong with Smith, Jayasuriya, Blackwell and Trescothick. But the same cannot be said of the bowling, which will find it difficult to dismiss teams twice on the flat Taunton pitch.\nThe first match of the season was against Durham UCCE, which showed how good a batting pitch Taunton is, with both teams scoring well. The first County Championship game was a draw against Lancashire at Old Trafford. The next game was a totesport League game against Warwickshire, which was abandoned as a draw because of rain.\nSomerset's second Championship game was a comprehensive innings defeat at the hands of Yorkshire, which was followed by another heavy defeat to Yorkshire on the Sunday, and a 9 wicket defeat by Essex in the Championship. They then lost by 8 wickets to the Foxes at Taunton, but on the May Day Bank Holiday thrashed Surrey.\nOn 4 May they were edged out of the C&amp;G Trophy at Round One by Leicestershire in a low-scoring game. They were then beaten by Durham in Stockton-on-Tees in the Championship, their fourth successive loss in the Championship, but continued their good form in the National League with a 16-run win in Edinburgh over the Scots. They picked up their form in the Championship, however, drawing with Lancashire in a rain-ravaged match before travelling to Northampton to beat the hosts Northamptonshire.\nJune started with a draw against Leicestershire, before two losses in the one-day league - to Leicestershire and Kent. Despite the poor one-day form, they could still pull off a four-wicket win against the Australians, however, widely recognised as the best in the world. Form eluded them in the league, though, as they whimpered to a 15-run defeat at the hands of Scotland at Taunton.\nThe Twenty20 Cup started with a confusing loss to Glamorgan Dragons where the scores were tied after 20 overs a side but Glamorgan won on fewer wickets down. However, Somerset got their revenge over Glamorgan five days later, in the middle of a three-game win streak. Then followed a rained-off game and two losses that threatened to send them out of the quarter-finals, but they recovered to beat Gloucestershire by 95 runs in a match where Somerset set a Twenty20 Cup record with their team score of 228 for 5. A stunning triple century from only 255 deliveries from Graeme Smith won them the match against Leicestershire, and they followed up with a win in Northampton to go through to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup at the Oval. After not playing in the Championship the following week, they beat Kent by eight wickets in a shortened National League match.\nTheir poor Championship form continued in the last week of July, however, as they went down to Durham by 207 runs. However, despite their poor performances in the two league competitions, they went on to defeat Leicestershire Foxes and Lancashire Lightning on the Twenty20 Cup finals day at The Oval, thus winning the Twenty20 Cup.\nTwo days later, it was back to normal proceedings for Somerset, however. They suffered two narrow National League losses in the space of two days, to Sussex Sharks and Derbyshire Phantoms, before eking out a five-run win over Derbyshire in the Championship. A high-scoring draw with Yorkshire followed, and Yorkshire stayed for yet another high-scoring match - a National League game which Somerset won by two runs. Away from Taunton, however, Somerset couldn't keep up their good batting, and their bowling conceded 696 runs in one innings as Worcestershire beat them by an innings and 56 runs. A victory over Durham in the National League redeemed that loss somewhat, though, and they continued on the winning path with victories over Essex in the Championship and Surrey in the National League.\nAfter a week-long break, September began with yet another National League victory, over Warwickshire, before their streak of four victories in a row was broken by Northamptonshire in a drawn game. As reigning Twenty20 Cup champions, they were invited to the , where they lost two matches and bowed out at the group stage. Two days later, they travelled up to Chester-le-Street, where a batting collapse led to a five-wicket defeat at the hands of Durham, and they also lost to Derbyshire in the Championship, the first team to do so in three years.\nMatch details.\nSomerset v Durham UCCE (9–11 April).\nMatch drawn\nAt Taunton, the first day of the season for these two teams made up Somerset's first innings. In 105 overs Somerset made a mammoth 580 for 5 declared. Ian Blackwell contributed 191, John Francis 123 and Matthew Wood 95 as Durham UCCE struggled. Francis and Wood's partnership is a new record fifth-wicket partnership for Somerset, beating the 235 put on by Box Case and Jack White in 1927. Somerset declared on their overnight total. However, on a good pitch, Durham UCCE fared well, making a mammoth 304 for the first wicket, and were 327 for 1 at close on the second day. Will Smith scored 156 and Alistair Maiden 211 not out before Durham UCCE were able to declare on 433 for 4, 147 behind. Also, this was against a first-class attack including Andrew Caddick and Nixon McLean. Somerset chose to bat out the rest of the day for a draw, finishing on 211 for 2 declared, with John Francis scoring 112. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLancashire v Somerset (13–16 April).\nLancashire (10pts) drew with Somerset (9pts)\nAt Old Trafford, Somerset won the toss and elected to field on a seaming pitch after a delayed start. Mal Loye was the only Lancastrian to score a half-century, as Somerset made the most of the conditions. Iain Sutcliffe, Stuart Law and Mark Chilton all worked themselves into the 30s, but failed to progress. Lancashire finished the first day on 235 for 7.\nSecond day honours went to Lancashire. First their not out batsmen, Dominic Cork and Sajid Mahmood, took the eighth wicket partnership to 94, and Lancashire finished on 323. Andrew Caddick took 4 for 78. James Anderson and Dominic Cork then set about damaging Somerset's batting. Only Ian Blackwell, who was dropped by Law at slip when on 17, put up much resistance, with captain and England opener Marcus Trescothick making only 11. At one stage Somerset were 53 for 4, and they finished the day on 193 for 7, with Blackwell not out on 74.\nJust as Lancashire's tail had pushed on at the end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally surrendering on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, \"I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me because they know that I go at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw.\" The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, \"It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold.\" After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.\nLancashire batted on for another 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly declaration batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, \"To get a couple of fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out. Getting a century is a psychological thing for a batsman. I don't set myself goals or anything like that, but it's always nice to get a hundred.\" (Cricinfo scorecard) \nWarwickshire v Somerset (17 April).\nMatch abandoned - Warwickshire (2pts), Somerset (2pts)\nWarwickshire won the toss at Edgbaston and put Somerset in to bat. Mike Burns dominated proceedings with his 107 from 134 balls, supported by Keith Parsons' 51 and James Hildreth's 54, as Somerset scored 254 for 5 in their 45 overs. However, then bad weather put an end to the day's play before Warwickshire had a chance to bat.\nYorkshire v Somerset (20–23 April).\nYorkshire (22pts) beat Somerset (3pts) by an innings and 44 runs\nRain meant no play was possible on the first day at Headingley. The second day was dominated by Ian Harvey, who, at close, was on a career-best 161 not out after being dropped by Andrew Caddick on 96. Yorkshire were on 401 for 7. Matthew Wood had added 95 in 174 balls earlier in the day.\nThe third day Somerset acting captain, Marcus Trescothick, was away, as his first child was born in the night. On the field Yorkshire declared on 501 for 9, after Harvey got 209 not out, and Tim Bresnan 74. Their eighth-wicket partnership of 238 is the second-highest for Yorkshire after the 292 put on by Lord Hawke and Bobby Peel in 1896. Somerset, batting with 10 men, lost opener Sanath Jayasuriya for 0 after 3 balls, and were all out for 182. Following on Somerset plummeted to 10 for 3, and then 37 for 4 (which, given Trescothick's absence, meant that they only had five batsmen left). However, they avoided losing further wickets on the third day, finishing on 109 for 4 at close, still 310 runs behind.\nSomerset clung on for 66 overs on the fourth and final day, with John Francis carrying his bat for 125 as they recovered to 275. This left Yorkshire with their first win of the campaign, and a comprehensive victory. (BBC scorecard)\nYorkshire v Somerset (24 April).\nYorkshire (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 5 wickets\nThe home side won easily at Headingley. The Sabres batted first and made 209 for 9 in their 45 overs, with four batsmen out with scores between 25 and 40. Former England Under-19 player Tim Bresnan took four for 25 for Yorkshire Phoenix. Yorkshire were always in control, thanks to a third-wicket partnership of 84 in 15 overs between Phil Jaques, who scored 84 off 78 balls, and Michael Lumb. Despite two late wickets, Yorkshire finished in style to win by 5 wickets with 32 balls remaining. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSomerset v Essex (27–30 April).\nEssex (22pts) beat Somerset (2pts) by nine wickets\nOn 35 overs were possible on the first day. On a green Taunton pitch, Somerset fared poorly against Essex's seam attack. Alex Tudor, who had moved from Surrey, took the first two wickets, including Marcus Trescothick for 4. Somerset were on 119 for 5 at stumps.\nSomerset were soon dismissed on the Thursday for 190. Essex's youngsters, Alastair Cook, who looked to be headed for an England call-up before long, and Ravinder Bopara, aged 20 and 19 respectively, made merry with the bat. Although the pitch did not seam as much as the first day, they put on 181 together. Cook was finally out bowled for 111, and Bopara not out for 71 at close, with Essex on 224 for 3, 34 runs ahead.\nBopara could not add to his overnight total on the third day, as he was caught off Richard Johnson's bowling. But Essex were able to take control, finally declaring on 427 for 8 when Tudor was run out for 57. Somerset's fast bowlers, Johnson and Andrew Caddick had picked up three wickets each, but had not been able to stop the flow of runs. Foster was not out on 78 when the declaration came. In reply, Somerset fared okay till Trescothick went with the score on 57, and then, at 65 for 1, Andre Adams, Essex's New Zealand import took a hat-trick. Mike Burns edged an outswinger, and Sanath Jayasuriya and James Hildreth were both leg before. With Adams picking up one more wicket before the close of play, Somerset finished on 128 for 5, still 109 runs off making Essex bat again.\nOn the Saturday, Somerset's tail was quickly reduced to 180 for 8. There was then something of a rearguard action with 63 put on by Caddick and Robert Turner for the ninth wicket, and Turner and Nixon McLean putting on 70 for the tenth. This left Essex with a target of 77 to win, which they did easily with the loss of just one wicket. (BBC scorecard)\nSomerset v Leicestershire (1 May).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Leicestershire (0pts) by 8 wickets\nThe Leicestershire Foxes were restricted to 211 for 8 at Taunton, with Aaron Laraman the pick of the Somerset bowlers - his bowling analysis read 9-2-17-2. Four Leicestershire batsmen passed 30, yet the highest score of the innings was Paul Nixon's 41. John Francis and Keith Parsons then completed the win for the Sabres with 73 and 91 respectively, sharing a third-wicket partnership of 157. This gave Somerset their first win in any competition this season, and meant that the Foxes were still waiting for their first win. (BBC scorecard)\nSomerset v Surrey (2 May).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by 99 runs (D/L method)\nSurrey Lions were never in this game, which was played at Taunton. The Sabres totalled a mammoth 325 for 6 in their 44 overs, with Sanath Jayasuriya (61 off 49), Marcus Trescothick (52 off 43) and Keith Parsons (85 off 75) doing most of the damage. The Lions were never in the hunt in reply. Whilst Ali Brown top-scored with a 37-ball 65, including seven fours and three sixes, wickets fell at regular intervals, and they finally finished on 226 for 9, 99 behind. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLeicestershire v Somerset (4 May).\nLeicestershire beat Somerset by 3 wickets to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nIt was an unusual game at Grace Road, which was all done by 3.30pm. The ball swung greatly, and there was seam movement, and Charl Willoughby of Leicestershire made the most of them first, taking 6 for 16 as Somerset were dismissed for 94 - though it could have been much worse, as they were 58 for 9 before Ian Blackwell and Simon Francis attacked and added 36 for the last wicket. Marcus Trescothick, the Somerset captain, who only made 11 said, \"Conditions were not conducive to one-day cricket, that's for sure. Unfortunately, we lost the toss and had the worst of it, but we still thought we could win because we have more consistent length bowlers. Even 130 or so could have been a great score.\"\nLeicestershire themselves struggled in reply, and Somerset took wickets regularly, reducing the hosts to 70 for 7. However, they were not able to take another, as Leicestershire ended on 96 for 7 - Ottis Gibson and Claude Henderson adding 26 for the eighth wicket, Leicestershire's highest partnership of the match. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nDurham v Somerset (6–9 May).\nDurham (19pts) beat Somerset (5pts) by four wickets\nDurham saw off the Andrew Caddick scare against Somerset to win a close match by four wickets. Somerset chose to bat after winning the toss at Stockton-on-Tees, in the first match at this ground in six years. England fast bowler Steve Harmison continued his return to form, removing both Somerset openers, but conceded many runs in the process, and it was England ODI all-rounder Paul Collingwood who was the star, taking the wickets of the Somerset top-scorers James Hildreth (caught by Gareth Breese for 70) and Ian Blackwell (bowled for 48) in addition to the three last lower-order wickets. Somerset were all out for 252 in just 63.3 overs.\nIn reply, Durham struggled with playing Andrew Caddick, as he removed four Durham batsmen for single-figure scores. Only Liam Plunkett (74 not out) and Mark Davies (62) managed to play Caddick with some success, and that was on the second day - at stumps on day one, Caddick had taken five wickets and reduced Durham to 141/7. Plunkett and Davies, batting at 8 and 10 respectively, saved the innings to 298 all out and a lead of 46 runs - while Caddick was taken around to end with six for 106.\nHarmison and Collingwood continued in the style of the first innings, although this time it was the real pace bowler who took the most wicket. On the afternoon of the second day, he again took both openers - including England opener Marcus Trescothick, and when Ian Blackwell (87) and Andrew Caddick threatened to run away with it with their partnership of 78 for the last wicket, it was Harmison who got Blackwell out, caught by Liam Plunkett. Durham were set a tricky target of 243, but the Jamaican-born all-rounder Gareth Breese saw off the challenge of Caddick, who took yet another six-for - this time for 98 - to end with match figures of 12 for 104. However, he was the only bowler to dig in, and Michael Hussey (51), Dale Benkenstein (51) and the aforementioned Breese with 79 not out saw Durham reach the target to preserve their unbeaten run in the Championship.\nScotland v Somerset (11 May).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Scotland (0pts) by 16 runs\nSomerset Sabres won thanks to a slogging effort by all-rounder Ian Blackwell who rescued them from a potentially dangerous position at Edinburgh. Winning the toss and batting, Scottish Saltires' bowlers Asim Butt, Majid Haq and Paul Hoffmann (who bowled 9 overs for 14 runs) tied the visitors down to 145 for 5 before Blackwell came on. Blackwell then proceeded to slam everything out of sight, smacking six sixes and seven fours in his 86 and lifting Somerset to 264 for 7. Colin Smith was the star of Scotland's reply, making 67, but they were never seriously in the chase, especially after Andrew Caddick removed Pakistani all-rounder Yasir Arafat and Smith. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSomerset v Lancashire (20–23 May).\nLancashire (11pts) drew with Somerset (7pts)\nRain ravaged the match between Somerset and Lancashire allowing little play on the first three days. Between the showers, Lancashire had Somerset at 48 for 2 on the first day, but the little play that was possible after that gave Mike Burns (87) and Sanath Jayasuriya (72 not out after three days) opportunity to increase the score to 195 for 3 on day 3. A draw looked more than likely, even if the sides would agree to forfeiting an innings. The fourth day was a full day of cricket, and Muttiah Muralitharan took five for 56 for Lancashire as they bowled Somerset out for 294. Iain Sutcliffe then lifted Lancashire to four batting points and 351 for 3 declared with his 150, well helped by an unbeaten century from Australian Brad Hodge.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (25–27 May).\nSomerset (21 pts) beat Northamptonshire (8 pts) by six wickets\nSomerset won the toss at Northampton and chose to bowl – and although they got the hosts Northamptonshire out in a day, Martin Love (166) and wicketkeeper Riki Wessels (son of Kepler) (102) made quick centuries to lift the hosts to 408. Conversely, however, two Northamptonshire batsmen batting at 4 and 5 perished for ducks to Richard Johnson. Somerset replied well, though, with 53 from opener Matthew Wood, but rash strokes gave wickets around everywhere as Somerset made 356 – admittedly only 52 behind. Off-spinner Jason Brown got six wickets for 112, just as many as he had taken before this game, while Ian Blackwell played a typical 59 off 77 balls.\nNorthamptonshire lost the wicket of Bilal Shafayat in their eight overs before stumps on day two but could still be reasonably pleased with the first two days' play. However, on the third day, their side collapsed with Gareth Andrew taking three for 31 as they crashed to 100 all out – Ian Blackwell removing two in his only over, which was also a maiden. In chasing 155, Somerset had some problems in tackling the bowling of Johann Louw, who took two wickets, but still managed a relatively comfortable six-wicket win.\nSomerset v Sussex (30 May).\nSussex (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 2 wickets\nSussex edged past Somerset with 2 balls and 2 wickets remaining. Somerset won the toss, batted, and fell to 88 for 5 against Sussex's tight bowling before Ian Blackwell smashed 10 sixes and 10 fours as he made 134 not out off only 71 balls. 4 of his sixes came in the 40th over, bowled by Mushtaq Ahmed: the first three balls went for six, then there were two singles, before Blackwell smashed the last ball out of the ground into the car park. His quickfire innings helped Somerset to 297 for 6 off their 45 overs. In reply Matt Prior made 77, but Sussex looked like a defeated side after 4 wickets from Keith Parsons sent them to 201 for 7, but Johannes van der Wath smashed 73 off 43 balls to sneak the victory, sharing an 82-run ninth-wicket stand with Jason Lewry. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLeicestershire v Somerset (1–4 June).\nLeicestershire (10pts) drew with Somerset (7pts)\nRain prevented any play on the first day at Oakham. The second day saw Leicestershire score 294 for 7, with HD Ackerman striking a century. They finished their innings on 338 a few overs into the third morning. Somerset did not apply themselves well in their reply, as they were dismissed cheaply for 105, and Leicestershire enforced the follow-on with a lead of 233 and just over a day still to play. John Francis scored a battling century as Somerset worked hard for the draw on the last day. They lost only 3 wickets as they effectively put up shop, scoring 225 in 100 overs to get the 4 points. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nLeicestershire v Somerset (5 June).\nLeicestershire (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 71 runs\nLeicestershire Foxes moved out of the bottom place with a comfortable win over Somerset Sabres at Oakham School. With Dinesh Mongia top-scoring with 75 as no Somerset bowler dug into the Leicestershire innings, they made 217 for 4 with relative ease, before crumbling to the left-arm spin of Mongia, as he took four wickets for 12 runs including captain and top-scorer Graeme Smith. Smith made 61 in a Somerset innings were only four batsmen made it into double figures, and the visitors crumbled to 146 all out.\nSomerset v Worcestershire (8–11 June).\nWorcestershire (22pts) beat Somerset (8pts) by eight wickets\nHaving won the toss and chosen to bat first at Bath, Somerset made 408 in the first innings including 127 by Matthew Wood and 55 by South Africa's Graeme Smith, captaining the side. Worcestershire put on 423 in reply, Ben Smith going on to make 140 and Stephen Moore 86 after both were dropped at slip in double figures by Ian Blackwell. Andrew Caddick took five for 132 in a 31-over effort for Somerset. Worcestershire then cemented their control over the game by dismissing Somerset for 152 in the second innings, with Matt Mason taking 5 for 34. The Worcestershire batsmen achieved the target of 138 for the loss of just 2 wickets, Moore making his second fifty of the match with an unbeaten 66. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSomerset v Kent (12 June).\nKent (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 74 runs\nMartin van Jaarsveld continued his stunning form for Kent Spitfires with 114 against Somerset Sabres which lifted the visitors to a massive 319 for 5, as the bowlers were smashed to all corners of the Recreation Ground in Bath. In reply, Ian Blackwell smashed 57 off 42 balls, but it was never enough as Somerset were all out in 37.3 overs - with 45 balls potentially remaining of their innings - for 245.\nSomerset v Australians (15 June).\nSomerset won by four wickets\nSomerset shocked everyone with a nail-biting win over Australia cricket team at Taunton, their first win over the Australians since 1977. Somerset were placed mid-table in the second division of the National League, and no one believed they should have any chance against an Australian team only missing Adam Gilchrist. And Australia backed that up with the bat - Matthew Hayden retired after a fun hit-out for 76, captain Ricky Ponting the same for 80, and Australia tonked 342 for 5.\nGraeme Smith and Sanath Jayasuriya, however, fought back for Somerset. The pair opened, and put on 197 for the first wicket in little over 20 overs - Smith smashing his way to a massive 68-ball hundred, ending with 108 with 17 fours and a six. Jayasuriya, not wishing to be worse, made a 77-ball ton - before getting out for 101 a bit later. The platform was set, however, and 24-year-old James Hildreth could steady the ship after Somerset had lost some wickets to part-time bowler Michael Hussey. Hildreth made 38 not out off 24 balls and saw them to a victory with 19 balls and four wickets to spare - more comfortable than the match looked for the most part. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSomerset v Scotland (17 June).\nScotland (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 15 runs\nOnly a couple of days ago, the lads from Somerset had beaten Australia's finest by five wickets, chasing the highest score in one-day matches. Now, they failed to chase down 233 set by the Scottish Saltires, after Jonathan Beukes smashed 92 and Yasir Arafat supplied with a 20-ball 32 including two sixes. It started well enough for Somerset, Graeme Smith continuing his fine form with 74, leading his team to 158 for 4. But then, the wheels fell off. Paul Hoffmann snared the important wicket of James Hildreth for 49, the lower order rolled over meekly to Arafat (who got 3-33), and with Jon Francis injured, the Sabres managed to lose the match by 15 runs as they were all out for 218.\nGlamorgan v Somerset (22 June).\nGlamorgan (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) on losing fewer wickets\nJames Hildreth scored a quick 46 off 26 deliveries at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had control over the Somerset batsmen, and yet they lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth got the better of them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which of course was pleasing to the home side.\nSomerset v Worcestershire (23 June).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Worcestershire (0pts) by 15 runs\nDespite captain Graeme Smith becoming victim of Zander de Bruyn's bowling for just two runs, Somerset Sabres still posted a big target, thanks to Matthew Wood, who made 94 off only 35 balls before falling to Nadeem Malik six short of a century. Wood's smashing helped the Sabres to 210 for 6, although no other batsman passed 30. Graeme Hick tried to emulate Wood, but could only make 87 before Ian Blackwell got the better of him, and from then on Worcestershire never really had a chance. Blackwell finished with two for 20 in his four overs, and could take his share of the honour for Somerset's surprising win.\nSomerset v Glamorgan (27 June).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Glamorgan (0pts) by 89 runs\nJames Hildreth smashed 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a convincing victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, they made a dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as experienced off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four. The visitors' reply never really got going, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (29 June).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Northamptonshire (0pts) by five wickets\nAt Northampton, Andy Caddick served up an unusually economical spell, taking two for 12 in three overs despite two wides. That helped tie the hosts Northamptonshire Steelbacks down to 95 for 6 in 12 overs in the rain-shortened game, and with Graeme Smith and Keith Parsons at the crease and the score 55 for 1, things looked bright for Somerset Sabres. Two wickets from Jason Brown helped put the odds for a Northamptonshire win down, but Somerset prevailed, Parsons hitting the winning runs on the last ball as Somerset finished on 97 for 5.\nGloucestershire v Somerset (1 July).\nNo result; Gloucestershire (1pt), Somerset (1pt)\nOnly thirteen overs of play was possible at The County Ground, Bristol. By that time, two Somerset Sabres batsmen had departed for golden ducks - Graeme Smith and James Hildreth - and Somerset were 61 for 7. Gloucestershire Gladiators would have fancied their chances, but rain intervened to spoil the party.\nSomerset v Northamptonshire (2 July).\nNorthamptonshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by five wickets\nDespite Graeme Smith making a 53-ball century, and pairing up with Matthew Wood for 129 for the first wicket, Somerset Sabres still lost the match at Taunton. Smith's 105 helped Somerset set a target of 190, but none of the bowlers conceded less than seven an over to Northamptonshire Steelbacks' batting. Simon Francis was the worst, ending with 57 conceded runs in four overs, while Riki Wessels hit 49 not out with four sixes off 22 balls, and the Sabres had to see that Northamptonshire won with an over to spare.\nWarwickshire v Somerset (4 July).\nWarwickshire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 47 runs\nWarwickshire Bears jumped on the quarter-final train just as it seemed to be leaving the station, grabbing the ticket out of the hands of Somerset Sabres. Neil Carter and Ian Bell opened the batting and scored quickly, sending the score to 40 for 1, but part-timer William Durston got three wickets in quick succession to have three for four at one point. Trevor Penney then smashed three successive sixes off Durston to end with 35 not out off 13 balls. Thus, Warwickshire closed on 172 for 8, and patient bowling from Carter and Alex Loudon sent them crumbling to 89 for 6. Arul Suppiah and Durston paired up for 27 for the seventh wicket, but when Suppiah was bowled by Jonathan Trott it looked hopeless for Somerset. Jamie Anyon wrapped them up with a hat-trick to end Somerset's innings on 125.\nSomerset v Gloucestershire (6 July).\nSomerset (2pts) beat Gloucestershire (0pts) by 95 runs\nSomerset Sabres made it through to the quarter-finals after recording a massive score of 228 for 5 in twenty overs - the highest team total in Twenty20 Cup history, eclipsing a record set a couple of weeks earlier. The most economical bowler was Steve Kirby, and he conceded 35 runs in four overs, while the other four where all taken for more than 40 runs. Graeme Smith top-scored with 53, Ian Blackwell made 45, and James Hildreth recorded 32 off 10 balls - 28 from six shots to the boundary and four from the other four deliveries. Somerset's innings featured eight sixes and twenty extras. Gloucestershire Gladiators, who were second in the Midland/Wales/West group before this game at Taunton, had to go for expansive strokes, and were all out in sixteen overs, Gareth Andrew taking four for 22 while Craig Spearman top scored with 35 off 17 balls. Keith Parsons also contributed bowling-wise, taking three for 12.\nSomerset v Leicestershire (8–11 July).\nSomerset (22pts) beat Leicestershire (6pts) by ten wickets\nGraeme Smith was the difference between the two teams at Taunton. After Leicestershire had made 330 in the first innings, with wicket-keeper Paul Nixon top scoring with 62 not out, it was time for the South African captain. Farming the strike exquisitely, he smashed 27 fours and eleven sixes in a career highest score of 311 - while his partners were sensible enough to not leave him stranded. Thus, Somerset made 566, and Andy Caddick and Charl Langeveldt paired up with good fast bowling to send Leicestershire down to 189 for 6. All-rounder Ian Blackwell then took three tail-end wickets to leave a target of 18 runs with more than a day to spare, and Somerset knocked off the runs inside six overs to win by ten wickets.\nNorthamptonshire v Somerset (18 July).\nSomerset beat Northamptonshire by four wickets to progress to the Semi-Finals of the Twenty20 Cup\nNorthamptonshire Steelbacks failed to take full use of their home advantage, and Somerset Sabres escaped with a four-wicket win to reach their first semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup. Northamptonshire's batsmen made quick scores between 20 and 30, but Ian Blackwell's spell mid-match of three for 16 pegged Northamptonshire back to 118 for 6. Ben Phillips then made an unbeaten 27 to lift his team to 154 for 8, however, but he couldn't take a wicket while bowling. Despite three run-outs, Somerset made it through on the penultimate ball, as Matthew Wood recorded 58 and Blackwell a 16-ball 31 to lay the foundation before Keith Parsons set the pace late on with an unbeaten 38.\nKent v Somerset (24 July).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Kent (0pts) by eight wickets\nThe match between Kent Spitfires and Somerset Sabres at St Lawrence Ground was shortened to 16 overs owing to bad weather. Kent were sent in to bat, and lost three early wickets, two to Andy Caddick and one to Richard Johnson, for only 11 runs. Robert Key and Justin Kemp both made 17, and James Tredwell smacked two sixes for his nine-ball 22 as Kent came back to 90 for 6, which was still below six runs an over. Tredwell also took two for 19 with his off breaks, but Graeme Smith hit nine fours as he made his way to an unbeaten 56, and James Hildreth won the match for Somerset with a six off Tredwell, with 20 balls potentially remaining in their chase.\nSomerset v Durham (26–29 July).\nDurham (22pts) beat Somerset (5pts) by 207 runs\nDurham continued their march through Division Two of the County Championship, recording their sixth win of the season thanks mainly to Paul Collingwood and spineless batting from Somerset. Collingwood made 181, for his second successive match with a century, and along with half-centuries from Mike Hussey, Gordon Muchall and Gareth Breese it lifted Durham to 476 for 9 declared seven overs into day three after the second day had been broken up by the rain. Jamaican spinner Gareth Breese then snared five for 83 as Somerset made their way to 303 in 68 overs, while Durham got to 208 for 1 in reply before declaring for the second time in the match - only Graeme Smith getting a wicket for Somerset. Smith started positively with fellow opener James Francis, adding 56 for the first wicket, but Breese added another four to his tally as he finished with match figures of nine for 138. Ian Blackwell played an unusually cautious knock of 8 off 62 balls, but he was eventually lbw to Michael Lewis, and Somerset subsided for 174 to lose by 207 runs.\nLeicestershire v Somerset (30 July).\nSomerset won by four runs and progress to the Twenty20 Cup final\nDefending champions Leicestershire Foxes failed to take care of an excellent position against Somerset Sabres, as the second semi-final became a low-scoring, yet thrilling affair. After Dinesh Mongia had taken three for 30 to set Somerset back to 139 for 7 after Graeme Smith (with 29), Matthew Wood (38) and Marcus Trescothick (25) had lifted them to 89 for 1 at one point during the innings. Carl Gazzard, Somerset's young wicketkeeper, made 26 to lift them to a final total of 157 for 9.\nIn reply, Darren Maddy and HD Ackerman lifted Leicestershire to 74 for no loss after eight overs, requiring \"only\" 83 from the last twelve. However, Ian Blackwell took three quick wickets to send Leicestershire to 90 for 3, Richard Johnson (figures of 3-0-21-3), Keith Parsons (3-0-15-0) and William Durston (3-0-18-1) bowled tightly to frustrate the Leicestershire batsmen, and despite a last-ball six from Paul Nixon, Somerset won by four runs and qualified for the final, where they would be facing Lancashire Lightning.\nLancashire v Somerset (30 July).\nSomerset beat Lancashire by seven wickets and won the 2005 Twenty20 Cup\nSomerset Sabres completed their run by springing the final upset to beat Lancashire Lightning in the Twenty20 Cup final. It should perhaps have been renamed Sixteen16, because rain earlier in the day delayed the schedule and meant that the final had been shortened to 16 overs a side, while the semi-finals had both been 20 overs. However, Somerset didn't mind - their strongest batsmen were their numbers one and two, Graeme Smith and Marcus Trescothick, and the more relative impact these two would have, the better for the Sabres. Their task was made easier, though, as Somerset fast bowler Andrew Caddick dug out a couple of early Lancashire wickets, which was followed a run-out and two wickets in two balls from Richard Johnson, as Lancashire crawled to 41 for 5.\nAustralian-born Stuart Law stood tall at the crease, defying the Somerset bowlers to make 59 before being run out on the very last ball, but Somerset only needed 115 from 16 overs - a run rate of 7.19. Smith and Trescothick started positively, before Trescothick's England teammate Andrew Flintoff had him edge behind to Warren Hegg for 10. With two more wickets falling, Lancashire would perhaps have fancied their chances with the Somerset score on 65 for 3, but Smith defied them with an unbeaten 64, adding 53 in a fourth-wicket stand with young James Hildreth to guide Somerset to the target with seven wickets and eleven balls to spare.\nSussex v Somerset (1 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 11 runs\nRobin Montgomerie and Matt Prior opened the batting with a partnership of 13, and Murray Goodwin added a further 97 with Montgomerie for the third wicket, as Sussex Sharks made 266 for 3 in their 45 overs. Montgomerie's 132 not out was his highest List A score Somerset Sabres lost wickets regularly, and despite dispatching Mushtaq Ahmed for 70 in 9 overs, they finished on 255 for 9 - Michael Yardy taking four for 26, while Ian Blackwell top-scored for Somerset with 57.\nDerbyshire v Somerset (3 August).\nDerbyshire (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 15 runs\nDerbyshire Phantoms jumped into fifth in the table thanks to their win over Somerset Sabres, who for the second time in that week conceded more than 260 in 45 overs. Michael Di Venuto slashed 11 fours on his way to 87, and despite two maiden overs from Andrew Caddick, Derbyshire made 277 for 5. Carl Gazzard and Malaysian Arul Suppiah gave Somerset a chance of chasing the big total with their 125-run second-wicket stand, but Jonathan Moss took four for 60 with his off breaks and Andy Gray three for 47 with medium-pace. That plunged Somerset to 241 for 9 before William Durston made 24 not out to see Somerset to the end of 45 overs - still 16 runs short of victory.\nDerbyshire v Somerset (4–7 August).\nSomerset (21pts) beat Derbyshire (7pts) by five runs\nArul Suppiah, James Hildreth and Wesley Durston helped themselves to boundaries and Somerset to a big first-innings total in a close match against Derbyshire. Suppiah passed fifty for the first time in his first-class career with a five-hour 123, while Durston was stranded on 146 not out - his only century of the season. Graeme Welch took four for 82 to be Derbyshire's most effective bowler, but that didn't say much, as they conceded 460 to Somerset's batsmen. However, Derbyshire's tactic of slow attrition worked well against Somerset's frontline bowlers, Andy Caddick and Ian Blackwell. They made 438, in a mammoth 149 overs, before declaring with eight men down - four Derbyshire batsmen making fifties, Ant Botha top-scoring with 91, while 40 overs from Caddick yielded four for 102. Somerset weren't too keen on a big target either, making 61 in 32 third-day overs, as the match looked to peter into one of the most drab draws of the Championship season.\nHowever, on the fourth day, 426 runs were hit and enough wickets fell to get a result. Blackwell smacked 88 not out in 85 balls as Somerset added 184 in the first fifty overs of the day before declaring, which set Derbyshire 268 to win in 50 overs - a good one-day total. Derbyshire attempted the chase, Jon Moss slashing 106 and adding runs with Luke Sutton, and at 247 for 4, Derbyshire looked to have a good chance at winning it. However, two run-outs and two wickets each for Blackwell and Caddick saw Derbyshire lose their last six men for 15 runs, and Somerset snatched a five-run win.\nSomerset v Yorkshire (10–13 August).\nSomerset (12pts) drew with Yorkshire (11pts)\nYorkshire and Somerset fought out a high-scoring draw at Taunton. Having opted to bat first, the visitors lost Joe Sayers for a duck, but Phil Jaques and Michael Lumb made centuries to see Yorkshire to 368 for 4. Then, Charl Langeveldt took the wickets of Craig White and Lumb, and Deon Kruis edged Andy Caddick behind for a duck to leave Yorkshire 377 for 7 overnight. Caddick wrapped up the innings on the second morning, finishing with six for 96, before Somerset opener Michael Wood started notching up boundaries. He made 35 fours and one six in a nine-hour cameo which yielded a total of 297 - before he was caught by Tim Bresnan 14 short of Somerset's highest innings for the season. With help from Ian Blackwell, who made 62, and Keith Parsons' 94, Somerset amassed 581 in a day and a half. Andy Caddick got an early breakthrough for Somerset, but Sayers and Anthony McGrath defied them, with a 119-run partnership for the second wicket. Only six overs of play was possible on day four before rain set in to ensure a drawn game.\nSomerset v Yorkshire (14 August).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by two runs\nIn a high-scoring match at The County Ground, Taunton, Matthew Wood and Ian Blackwell both cracked centuries as Somerset Sabres made their way to 345 for 4. Blackwell's 114 came off just 61 balls, with a total of 74 runs in boundaries. Paul Jaques, Ismail Dawood and Michael Wood all made half-centuries, but in the end Yorkshire Phoenix needed 23 to win off the last over, number 11 Deon Kruis facing Blackwell. The first ball was a dot ball, but a six and three fours followed - however, Kruis needed four for the tie and six for the win on the last ball. He couldn't get the ball to the boundary, and Somerset prevailed by two runs.\nWorcestershire v Somerset (16–19 August).\nWorcestershire (22pts) beat Somerset (4pts) by an innings and 56 runs\nSomerset were bowled out for 318 on the first day at New Road, but for the efforts of Malaysian Arul Suppiah (who made 72), wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard (74) and the 18-year-old debutant from Taunton, Robert Woodman (46 not out), it would have been far worse. The Worcestershire bowlers shared out the wickets, and Somerset were in real trouble at 57 for 5, but Suppiah stayed calm and the lower order made good contributions. Nadeem Malik got the best figures for Worcestershire, with three for 63.\nHowever, Somerset's bowling left something to be desired. After an opening stand of 51, Worcestershire powered onwards, with number three Zander de Bruyn smashing 28 fours in a four-hour 161. Ben Smith and Steve Davies also got centuries, as Worcestershire at one point were 618 for 3. Three wickets from Keith Parsons set them back, but Worcestershire could still declaration and forfeiture declare on 696 for 8. Suppiah started well once again, making 34 in a 110-run partnership with Matthew Wood as Somerset made their way to 138 for 1. Then spinners Ray Price and Gareth Batty shared the next seven wickets for 70 runs, and Somerset imploded to 209 for 8 while still needing 169 to avoid the innings defeat. A good rearguard from number eight Carl Gazzard, and his partners Andy Caddick and Simon Francis saw Somerset first past 250 and then past 300. They looked to make Worcestershire bat again when Kabir Ali had Francis bowled - his only wicket of the innings, as he finished with expensive figures of 8.5-0-50-1. Batty and Price bowled 87 of Worcestershire's total of 108.5 overs, and Price's 44 overs included 21 maidens.\nSomerset v Durham (21 August).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Durham (0pts) by five wickets\nDurham Dynamos failed to take the opportunity of taking a lead in Division Two of the National League, as they went down by five wickets at Taunton. Having won the toss, they struggled to hit out initially, Gavin Hamilton recording 22 off 51 balls and 18-year-old Robert Woodman bowling two maiden overs. However, Dale Benkenstein made an unbeaten 60 and Gareth Breese a quickfire 28 as Durham made their way to 222 for 7 in 45 overs, William Durston getting the best figures for Somerset Sabres with two for 32 - admittedly in five overs - while South African Charl Langeveldt took two for 33 in nine overs. The Sabres hit out well chasing the target, Matthew Wood continuing on his good run of form with 76, and Keith Parsons worked well with Durston, adding 83 runs for the sixth wicket to guide Somerset home after Neil Killeen and Gareth Breese had taken two wickets each to set Somerset back to 143 for 5.\nEssex v Somerset (24–27 August).\nSomerset (16pts) beat Essex (5pts) by five wickets\nSomerset exploited Essex' declarations to take a five-wicket win despite rain dominating at Colchester, Somerset's fourth win of the season. After the first day was over, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but good contributions from the rest of the batting line-up - William Jefferson top-scoring with 93 - gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They powered on to 400 before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster made 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel whipped out two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth made 76 not out before the close of day three to set Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out. André Nel removed Michael Wood for a duck again, but Arul Suppiah added a quick 29, and former England Under-19 player Hildreth settled in well. He made his second unbeaten score of the match, this time worth 125, guiding Somerset past the winning target in 66.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Danish Kaneria bowled 24 of Essex' 66 overs, but to little effect, ending with one wicket for 80 runs, while Nel got William Durston for a duck to end with four wickets for the match - all ducks.\nSurrey v Somerset (28 August).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by five wickets\nSurrey Lions made 237 for 7 batting first at The Oval, despite three wickets from Malaysian Arul Suppiah. The stage was set for a bigger score with James Benning and Mark Butcher in with the score 135 for 1, but Suppiah and Ian Blackwell broke through with wickets to prevent high scoring rates towards the end. Somerset Sabres, and in particular Blackwell, were intent on winning this match. Blackwell hit six sixes and seven fours in a lightning-quick 88, adding 120 with James Hildreth for the fourth wicket before his eventual dismissal - to the part-time off spin of Mark Ramprakash. Despite Nayan Doshi getting another wicket, it was too late for Surrey, as Hildreth added 17 with William Durston to see them across the line with five overs to spare.\nSomerset v Warwickshire (5 September).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by four wickets\nJonathan Trott set up Warwickshire Bears for a big total at Taunton, making 112 not out as Warwickshire eased to 278 for 5, also helped by scores in the 40s from Neil Carter, Nick Knight and Trevor Penney. Somerset Sabres scored quickly in reply, Matthew Wood spending 39 balls for his 53 before being bowled by Trott, but at 187 for 6, the odds were long. However, Wesley Durston and John Francis added 94 for the seventh wicket, as Somerset won with an over to spare. Warwickshire's opening bowler Dougie Brown only bowled two of a possible nine overs, conceding 23 runs.\nSomerset v Northamptonshire (7–10 September).\nNorthamptonshire (12pts) drew with Somerset (10pts)\nIan Blackwell and Arul Suppiah made scores of 98 and 91 respectively, as Somerset made their way to 396 batting first at Taunton, although the lower order struggled against the spin of Monty Panesar - who dug out Richard Johnson and Charl Langeveldt for ducks. Matthew Wood set the pace, adding 63 with James Francis in an opening partnership where Francis only contributed 8 before he was lbw to Steven Crook, who had changed counties from Lancashire to Northamptonshire. That was Crook's only wicket of the match, however, as he finished with match figures of 25-2-107-1.\nNorthamptonshire got off to a bad start, losing the first three wickets for 76 runs, but centuries from Usman Afzaal, who made 112, and David Sales, ending on 154 before being caught and bowled by Richard Johnson, lifted them back with a 175-run stand for the fourth wicket. Fifties from all-rounders Damien Wright (who added 131 with Sales for the sixth wicket), Simon Crook and Johann Louw lifted Northamptonshire to 574. Then, Wright took two wickets and Somerset fell to four runs for two wickets. Francis made his second half-century and James Hildreth also scored 50, however, leaving Somerset at 163 for 4 at stumps on day three. The match was intriguingly poised, but rain ruined a potentially interesting finish, as no play was possible on day four and the match was drawn.\nSomerset v Faisalabad (16 September).\nFaisalabad (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 30 runs\nFaisalabad Wolves overcame the reigning English Twenty20 Cup champions Somerset Sabres thanks to the all-round efforts of Mohammad Hafeez. Opening the batting, he hit six sixes and six fours in a 35-ball 79, and helped by the 17 extras and 40 from Ijaz Ahmed junior, the Pakistani club made 207 for 5. Arul Suppiah took one wicket and conceded five runs for Somerset in his lone over, but was still taken off, possibly due to the two wides he bowled. Somerset needed 10.35 off every over, and they took ten off the first, but wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard had to retire hurt and Wood was caught by Hafeez, leaving the score at 31 for 2 (effectively, counting Gazzard's retirement as a wicket) with Ian Blackwell at the crease. He took 14 fours and two sixes in a 48-ball 82, but once he departed the remainder of the batting order failed to keep up with the asking rate of nearly twelve an over. Hafeez wrapped up the tail, taking three for 23, but credit also went to Samiullah Khan, who earlier dismissed Somerset opener Matthew Wood and number four James Hildreth.\nLeicestershire v Somerset (16 September).\nLeicestershire (2pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 66 runs\nThe hosts Leicestershire Foxes could conceivably have been knocked out of the tournament with a loss in this match, but three knocks worth more than 35 runs and bowling two maiden overs helped them to a 66-run win. HD Ackerman (run-a-ball 28) and Darren Maddy (42) hit plenty of boundaries in the opening overs to give Leicestershire 76 runs for the first wicket. Maddy took a particular liking to young seamer Richard Woodman, whom he took for 16 in an over. Then, both openers fell within the space of three balls, but Dinesh Mongia pushed onward with John Sadler, to add 79 for the third wicket. A few lofted shots to fielders in the deep led to three catches in the final overs, and the final score was 171 for 6, Woodman repairing his figures somewhat with a 19th over that yielded two wickets and went for only five runs, and Leicestershire only added 15 from their last 15 balls.\nSomerset Sabres started positively in the chase, making their way to 32 for 2 after four overs, but a wicket maiden over from David Masters - including the wicket of Somerset captain Ian Blackwell - set them back. Their batsmen from three through seven were all dismissed in single figures, and though John Francis made 49, Somerset still needed 91 for the last three wickets. 18-year-old wicket-keeper Sam Spurway made his Somerset debut in this match, standing in for the injured Carl Gazzard, and Spurway made 15 not out, seeing out the last overs as Somerset closed on 106 for 8 to be knocked out of the tournament.\nDurham v Somerset (18 September).\nDurham (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by five wickets\nDurham Dynamos bowled first and used the ball to good effect against the Somerset Sabres at the Riverside Ground, with Neil Killeen and Paul Collingwood getting three wickets each. Seven Somerset batsmen were caught, as Somerset lost their first nine wickets for 94, before Wesley Durston and Simon Francis added a 46-run last-wicket partnership. Killeen conceded only 15 runs in his nine overs. Durston also took two for 21 following his 46 with the bat, but 40 from Gordon Muchall saw Durham to the target with nearly 15 overs to spare, giving them promotion in the National League as well - their second promotion of the week.\nSomerset v Derbyshire (21–24 September).\nDerbyshire (22pts) beat Somerset (3pts) by an innings and 18 runs\nHalf-centuries from James Hildreth and James Francis took Somerset to 259 in 64.5 overs at their home ground at Taunton. Hildreth's 84 included 15 fours, while Francis hit ten fours in his 54. For Derbyshire, all-rounder Graeme Welch took three early wickets for 42, while 19-year-old Wayne White, who had made his first class debut with match figures of one for 123 a week earlier against Yorkshire, ended with four wickets for 77 in just under 13 overs. Chris Bassano and Steve Stubbings then added 87 for the first wicket, and Derbyshire closed on 126 for 1. On the second day, Stubbings continued with Hassan Adnan, and both earned career best scores - Stubbings with 151 and Adnan with 191 not out. Gareth Andrew was the only Somerset bowler to take more than one wicket, ending with four for 134, but Derbyshire made 707 for 7 - a county record - declaring when Luke Sutton fell for 53, leaving Graeme Welch stranded on 99 not out.\nFrancis then hit a 125-ball century as Somerset battled to save the draw and avoid becoming the first team to lose to Derbyshire for 14 months. But Francis went early on the last morning, the last man out in a collapse that started with 173 for 2 in the morning (Arul Suppiah had been dismissed with the score 172 for 1) and ended on 174 for 5. Somerset captain Ian Blackwell took seventeen fours and two sixes off Derbyshire's bowling in a 67-ball ton, but Welch came back, taking the last three wickets as Derbyshire broke their duck of 21 matches without a win and completed their Championship win since July 2004.\nSomerset v Derbyshire (25 September).\nSomerset (4pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by 135 runs\nDerbyshire Phantoms failed to carry their momentum from the Championship match earlier in the week, and fell to Somerset Sabres and the all-round effort of Ian Blackwell to lose all hopes of promotion. The Sabres were put in to bat, and after Matthew Wood and James Francis added 100 for the first wicket, Blackwell stepped in to bat. He hit 75, the same number of runs as Keith Parsons from number 5, and Somerset closed on 300 for 6. Derbyshire batsmen Ben France and Hassan Adnan started to build towards the target of 301 to win with an 81-run partnership for the second wicket, but both of them were stumped off Blackwell, and he also had three men caught off his bowling to end with five for 26. Malaysian Arul Suppiah also took two for 23, and two run outs left Derbyshire all out for 165."

        "text": "Sussex County Cricket Club played in Division One of the County Championship and Division Two of the Totesport League in 2005. The 2003 County Champions started the season at 6–1 to retake the title.\nAfter a draw against the Loughborough students, Sussex started their season at the Oval. It was a fixture seriously curtailed by the rain, which made a draw a certainty, though they were able to pick up 9 points. The next Championship game saw a close draw against Hampshire: a game which might have been won, but for negative play by their opponents at the crunch. They then beat Derbyshire in a thriller in the Sunday League, before a four-day loss to Nottinghamshire. The next day they went down to Yorkshire, and then on the May Day Bank Holiday their game with Durham was abandoned halfway through. On 4 May they easily beat Bedfordshire to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy.\nThey then beat Warwickshire in the totesport League, before securing a convincing innings victory against the same team in the County Championship, and then going on to beat the Bangladeshi tourists by an innings and 226 runs. On 18 May they beat Nottinghamshire to reach the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy. There was then a draw against Middlesex which left them sixth in Division One of the Championship at the end of May. They then drew with Division One whipping boys Glamorgan in a game reduced to 3 days because of rain.\n10 June saw an easy win against the Scottish Saltires, before drawing another rain-ravaged match with Nottinghamshire. In the National League on the following Sunday, they won a top-of-the-table clash with Durham, sending them within two points of the Northern lads. In the Twenty20 Cup, there were two meetings with Essex, each team winning one – in between, there was a rained-off match with Hampshire, in which both teams scored a point. Sussex then lost two successive matches, which was thought to permanently damage their quarter-final chances, but they recovered with wins over Hampshire and Kent which sent them into third place of the South Division. However, because they had fewer wins than Derbyshire in the North Division, they were knocked out as the worst third-place finisher.\nFollowing on from their disappointing Twenty20 Cup exit, they lost by 35 runs to Hampshire at the Rose Bowl in the Championship, but recovered to beat Surrey Lions by 48 runs to go top of the National League. A low-scoring draw with Gloucestershire followed, which left both sides struggling in the relegation zone.\nAugust began with an 11-run win over Somerset Sabres in the National League, which gave them a four-point lead in that competition. Following that, Sussex enjoyed a five-wicket win over Surrey in the County Championship which saw them jump past Surrey in the table. A loss to Leicestershire Foxes in the National League followed, however, but they carried their good Championship form into the return match with Gloucestershire to win by 226 runs. However, they lost yet again in the National League, as the Division Two title battle with Durham tightened.\nThe third week of August saw Sussex thump Middlesex inside two days, beating them by an innings and 232 runs – the highest margin of victory in the entire season – to temporarily go top of Division One, only 18 days after they had been precariously positioned in the relegation zone. However, the week ended with another loss to Leicestershire in the National League, which meant that Leicestershire also involved themselves in the title battle in Division Two. Three days later, Sussex beat Warwickshire in the same competition, mainly thanks to figures of 6–27 from Michael Yardy. In the County Championship, however, they lost to Warwickshire, before finishing August with two National League victories over Scotland and Surrey.\nSeptember began with a two-day victory over Glamorgan, which kept their slim Championship title hopes alive, but those were well and truly killed by Nottinghamshire's victory over Kent. However, other teams lost in the National League to give them promotion in that competition, and their fourth National League win in a row – over Kent Spitfires at St Lawrence Ground – left them in control of the race for the Division Two title. Sussex finished the Championship season with an eight-wicket victory over Kent, leaving them third in the Championship, and a win over Yorkshire Phoenix gave them the National League Division Two title.\nMatch details.\nSussex v Loughborough UCCE (9–11 April).\nMatch drawn\nThe first day of this match, which was played at Hove, saw Loughborough dismissed for 237. Sussex then reached 15 for no loss at close. Sussex batted through the second day, adding 352 in the 105 overs available, after both Ian Ward and Richard Montgomerie both got centuries. Sussex were finally dismissed for 490 on the third and last day. This did not leave them enough time to dismiss Loughborough UCCE a second time, and they were 103 for 5 at the end of the match. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSurrey v Sussex (13–16 April).\nSurrey (12pts) drew with Sussex (9pts)\nSussex won the toss at the Oval and elected to bat. Mark Ramprakash captained Surrey as Mark Butcher has still not recovered from the injury that saw him miss England's winter tour. Only 49 overs could be bowled on the first day, as rain delayed the start till after lunch, and bad light brought an early conclusion. Cloud cover helped the bowlers, but Sussex, thanks to Michael Yardy's 44 not out, finished the day on 171 for 4. The second day saw 61 overs. Yardy, again under cloud-covered skies, progressed to 111, which will have gone a long way to helping him cement a regular first team place. Rikki Clarke, who took 4 for 91, appears a yard quicker than last season, and to have improved after his poor season last year. Sussex finished the second day on 370, and Surrey on 6 for 1.\nOnly 13.3 overs were possible on a rain-affected third day, as Surrey moved to 33 for 1, with a draw a virtual certainty. The day was enlivened by the sight of a fox on top of one of the famous gasholders. It presumably went onto the top when the gasholder was low, and was trapped as the level rose. On the fourth day, Surrey's stand-in captain Ramprakash made an impressive 152, as Surrey elected to prolong their first innings until they reached 402 for 5 declared, to claim maximum batting points. The game ended there as a draw. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Hampshire (20–23 April).\nSussex (9pts) drew with Hampshire (9pts)\nHampshire finished the first day on top at Hove. Sussex, despite a century from Michael Yardy, were all out for 252, with Chris Tremlett taking 6 for 44. In reply, the visitors reached 67 for 1. Only for the position to be reversed on the second day, as they were dismissed for 280, with James Kirtley claiming 4 and Robin Martin-Jenkins 3 wickets. Sussex finished on 101 for 2.\nThe game remained evenly poised on the third day, but with Sussex slightly in the lead, with rain predicted for the fourth. Sussex took their score on to 312, thereby setting a target of 285. Hampshire were on 89 for 3 at the end of day three. With rain predicted on the fourth day, the game could have gone any one of four ways. Kevin Pietersen (61), assisted by Sean Ervine (57), took the challenge to Sussex – and the game was always in the balance. When the eighth wicket fell, the score was on 256 for 8. And with 29 required off 34 balls, the game looked set for one of those exciting finishes that only the longer form of the game can provide. Disappointingly for the crowd, Hampshire captain Shane Warne ordered his batsmen to shut up shop. Sussex were unable to take the final two wickets, and on 267 for 8, the game was drawn. Hampshire finished the day second behind Warwickshire, but the ten points given up here had crucial repercussions later on in the season. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Derbyshire (24 April).\nSussex (4pts) beat Derbyshire (0pts) by 2 runs (D/L method)\nA close game at Hove saw the Sharks defeat the Phantoms by 2 runs, after Tom Lungley went for, and failed to get, a six of the last ball to win the game. It was a high scoring affair, and halfway through their overs Sussex looked on target for a big total approaching 300. However, Derbyshire did well to peg them back to 254 to 8.\nRain delayed the restart, and left the Phantoms with 205 to win off 32 overs. They were always behind par, but never quite gave up. Indeed, Graeme Welch nearly won it for them with 42 off 24 balls, which included three huge sixes. However, wickets tumbled, leaving Tom Lungley with the last ball to score six. To his credit, he went for it and could have won, but fell short and was run out. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nNottinghamshire v Sussex (27–30 April).\nNottinghamshire (22pts) beat Sussex (6pts) by ten wickets\nOnly 36.3 overs were possible on the first day at Trent Bridge. Sussex batted first and, despite losing 2 early wickets, were 116 for 2 at close, with Michael Yardy (38) and Murray Goodwin (33) the not out batsmen. Yardy went on to make a half-century, as did wicket-keeper Matt Prior and Robin Martin-Jenkins, but no-one went further than 66 on the second day, as Sussex were dismissed for 379. Nottinghamshire progressed slowly, and were 32 for no loss off 15 overs at close.\nThe third day was all Nottinghamshire's. Jason Gallian made his highest score for the county, 199, while Stephen Fleming, who took over as captain from Gallian this season, made 111. Both were run out by precise throws from Ian Ward and Mushtaq Ahmed respectively. David Hussey (89) and Chris Read (45 not out) gave good support as Notts reached 488 for 6 at close.\nOn the fourth day, Nottinghamshire declared after 5.5 overs on 509 for 8, a lead of 130. If they were to win, they'd have to dismiss Sussex quickly. This they did. Ryan Sidebottom took 4 for 15 as Sussex were dismissed for 159, despite a two-hour 49 from Martin-Jenkins. Darren Bicknell and Jason Gallian only needed 5.5 overs to knock off the 30 runs needed to win. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nYorkshire v Sussex (1 May).\nYorkshire (4pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 3 wickets\nRichard Dawson and Craig White took 3 wickets apiece to help dismiss the Sharks for 157, as Sussex lost the last 7 wickets for 55 runs. Despite tight bowling from Mushtaq Ahmed on a damp pitch, the Phoenix eased to a win with 3 wickets and 27 balls remaining. Anthony McGrath (37) and Ian Harvey (30) shared a fifth-wicket stand of 63. (BBC scorecard)\nNational League: Durham v Sussex (2 May).\nNo result – Durham (2pts), Sussex (2pts)\nAt Chester-le-Street Durham Dynamos won the toss and put Sussex Sharks in to bat. Steve Harmison bowled well for his 1 for 24 off 9 overs, though it was Mick Lewis who took the wickets, ending with 5 for 48. For the Sharks, Johannes van der Wath top scored with 80 and shared a 110-run partnership with Robin Martin-Jenkins to pull Sussex out from 60 for 5 to a final total of 182 for 7 in 45 overs. In reply the Dynamos slumped to 9 for 2 off 7.3 overs, losing both openers for ducks before rain came and finished the match 15 balls before Duckworth-Lewis could be applied. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nBedfordshire v Sussex (4 May).\nSussex beat Bedfordshire by 8 wickets to progress to Round Two of the C&amp;G Trophy\nBedfordshire batted first at Luton. They progressed slowly, making their first 50 in the 23rd over. Whilst they improved to 143 for 9 in their 50 overs, it was never going to be enough. By way of comparison, it took Sussex six overs to reach their first 50, with Ian Ward (65 off 44) scoring most of the early runs, although admittedly batting was easier on the drying pitch. Sussex overhauled their modest target with 31.3 overs to go – almost two thirds of their allotted quota. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Warwickshire (8 May).\nSussex (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by 44 runs (D/L method)\nSussex Sharks had England wicket-keeper Matt Prior and former Zimbabwe batsman Murray Goodwin to thank for their imposing win over the Bears. Prior scored 144 – a career best score – and Goodwin 79 to lift Sussex to a massive 283 for 7, Zimbabwe all-rounder Heath Streak the only bowler with reasonably respectable figures of three for 39 off 9 overs. The reply was shortened by rain, setting Warwickshire 198 to win off 30 overs, but after 48 from Neil Carter there was little left in the Warwickshire reply as they finished on 153 for 7.\nSussex v Warwickshire (10–12 May).\nSussex (21pts) beat Warwickshire (2pts) by an innings and 87 runs\nMichael Yardy (88) and Murray Goodwin (108) as Sussex made 282 for 6 on the first day at Hove. Batting was not easy, with Heath Streak, Dewald Pretorius and Neil Carter all swinging the ball. On the second day, Sussex moved to 412 all out, and in reply, defending champions Warwickshire made 141 for 5. There was worse news for England cricket fans as Ashley Giles was unable to field because of a strained hip flexor muscle. Giles said, \"It's a shame because it's been going really well. It's the best start to a season I've had but the hip was a bit stiff last week and it got worse yesterday. I haven't had this kind of injury before so, even without the England situation, it would be stupid to make it any worse.\"\nOn the third day, Sussex completed the match. Warwickshire were all out for 179, and then, following-on they were dismissed again for 146. Fifteen wickets fell in 64 overs as the Sussex bowlers made the most of an erratically bouncing pitch. It was Warwickshire's first Championship loss since the last day of the 2003 season. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Bangladeshis (15–17 May).\nSussex beat the Bangladeshis by an innings and 226 runs\nSussex recorded a big victory at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling them out twice for a pittance, which did not exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence a week before the first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 – the highest score of the English first class season so far – which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar got hit by a bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy – who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.\nSussex v Nottinghamshire (18 May).\nSussex beat Nottinghamshire by 4 wickets to progress to the Quarter-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nNottinghamshire got off to a bad start at Hove by losing their first 3 wickets for only 12 runs. They continued to lose wickets at regular intervals until the score moved on to 111 for 8, when Samit Patel (61) and Gareth Clough (22) came together and lifted the total to 195 for 9 off the 50 overs. Three Nottinghamshire batsmen were run out. Sussex immediately lost Ian Ward and Mike Yardy, moving to 1 run for 2 wickets. However, the ship was steadied with half-centuries from Murray Goodwin and Carl Hopkinson and they eventually eased through with 3 wickets and 18 balls to go. The win, however, came at a price for Sussex, who now had to play Lancashire away in the next round, rather than host the touring Australians in a 3-day game. The cost of the win was estimated at £50,000. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Middlesex (25–28 May).\nMiddlesex (12pts) drew with Sussex (10pts)\nJames Kirtley took his first five-wicket-haul of the season at Hove to peg back Middlesex in a match where Middlesex were otherwise well in control. Nine of their batsmen went into double figures, Irishman Ed Joyce making another fine score with 82, but Kirtley's six for 80 saved some of their blushes. In reply, Irfan Pathan dug out two Sussex wickets early to give Middlesex a good chance, but Chris Adams, the captain, fought back with a fine 72 while 33-year-old Zimbabwe exile Murray Goodwin made 67, and a good fight-back from the lower-order lifted Sussex to 332. Mushtaq Ahmed plugged away to make 57, while Kirtley helped out with a 95-ball 14, to defy Pathan, who nevertheless got fine figures of four for 81 in his debut in England.\nJason Lewry then took six Middlesex wickets for 65 runs, reducing them to 244, although if it had not been Jamie Dalrymple's (65) and Paul Weekes' (71) partnership of 140 for the sixth wicket, things would have looked even nastier for Middlesex. In reply, Sussex were cautious in their chase of 314, but a big partnership between Richard Montgomerie and Murray Goodwin nearly won it for them. However, New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris took four Sussex wickets for 79, and Alan Richardson took four for 38 – including Goodwin and skipper Adams. Sussex lost four wickets for 17 runs to crash to 280 for 6, but Kirtley and Lewry held out as Sussex finished 28 runs short of a victory and Middlesex finished one wicket short of victory in this bottom-fight.\nSomerset v Sussex (30 May).\nSussex (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 2 wickets\nSussex edged past Somerset with 2 balls and 2 wickets remaining. Somerset won the toss, batted, and fell to 88 for 5 against Sussex's tight bowling before Ian Blackwell smashed 10 sixes and 10 fours as he made 134 not out off only 71 balls. 4 of his sixes came in the 40th over, bowled by Mushtaq Ahmed: the first three balls went for six, then there were two singles, before Blackwell smashed the last ball out of the ground into the car park. His quickfire innings helped Somerset to 297 for 6 off their 45 overs. In reply Matt Prior made 77, but Sussex looked like a defeated side after 4 wickets from Keith Parsons sent them to 201 for 7, but Johannes van der Wath smashed 73 off 43 balls to sneak the victory, sharing an 82-run ninth-wicket stand with Jason Lewry. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nGlamorgan v Sussex (1–4 June).\nSussex (12pts) drew with Glamorgan (8pts)\nGlamorgan avoided defeat again despite following on at Swansea, mainly thanks to the first day being rained off. On the second day, which was also shortened, Sussex scored 225 for 2 after Glamorgan won the toss and put them in. Two Sussex batsmen reached their highest scores of 2005 on the third morning, as Richard Montgomerie ended with 184 not out – 12 off his career best – and Murray Goodwin reached 158. Sussex finally declared on 497 for 5, and in reply Matthew Elliott made 85 and David Hemp 128 and Glamorgan reached 301, which was not enough to avoid the follow-on. The experienced fast bowler Jason Lewry took six for 77 for Sussex, while the Welsh team's new import, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, scored a duck in his first innings. However, Glamorgan comfortably achieved a draw with Matthew Elliott striking 162 in the second innings. When time was called, Glamorgan were on 354 for 3. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nScotland v Sussex (10 June).\nSussex (4pts) beat Scotland (0pts) by 8 wickets\nScotland had a bad week. First, Asim Butt, the leading Scottish seam bowler was banned for a year after testing positive for ecstasy. They then went down heavily to Sussex Sharks at The Grange in their last home game before the 2005 ICC Trophy in three weeks' time. The Saltires batted first and lost wickets regularly. Only Colin Smith, with 61, made any sort of score as they were dismissed for 172. The Sharks chased down the target easily, as openers Matt Prior and Ian Ward put on 108, and whilst Scotland were able to take two wickets, Sussex sped home with 16.3 overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Nottinghamshire (15–18 June).\nSussex (11pts) drew with Nottinghamshire (11pts)\nA rain-ravaged match at Arundel, where only seven overs were possible on the second day, ended in a drab draw. Batting first, Sussex needed seven sessions of play to make 355, despite only facing 87 overs, and Nottinghamshire were not overly excited in getting a result, either. Matt Prior, Murray Goodwin (in the second innings) and Chris Adams (also in the second innings) made tons for Sussex in the match, Stephen Fleming made one for the visitors, and Sussex' Jason Lewry was the pick of the bowlers with six for 74.\nSussex v Durham (19 June).\nSussex (4pts) beat Durham (0pts) by seven wickets\nDurham Dynamos sorely missed their two international stars, Steve Harmison and Paul Collingwood, as they whimpered to a seven-wicket defeat in the top-of-the-table clash at Arundel against Sussex Sharks. Dale Benkenstein won the toss and chose to have his Durham side bat first, as he made 57 not out from number five, but there was woefully little support as Durham collapsed from 129 for 3 to 195 all out. James Kirtley was the main culprit with four for 29 but every Sussex bowler except Robin Martin-Jenkins got among the wickets. In reply, Ian Ward blitzed 93 off 75 balls, Chris Adams was just as punishing with 58 off 49, and Liam Plunkett was plundered for 46 off only four overs – including nine wides. In only 29.3 overs, the match was over, Sussex getting a bit of Twenty20 practice in as they closed the gap at the top of the table to two points.\nSussex v Essex (22 June).\nSussex (2pts) beat Essex (0pts) by nine wickets\nEssex Eagles collapsed to lose their first match of the 2005 Twenty20 Cup to Sussex Sharks. Winning the toss and batting, Essex quickly made their way to 55 for 1, with Ronnie Irani hitting 34 off 18 balls. But two quick wickets set them back, Andy Flower was then run out, and Mushtaq Ahmed ended their innings with five for 11 from 21 deliveries – as Essex ended all out for 109. In a stately reply, Sussex did not hurry too much, as Matt Prior scored 66 off 50 balls, and 14 extras helped the Sharks past the target after 14.4 overs.\nHampshire v Sussex (24 June).\nNo result; Hampshire (1pt), Sussex (1pt)\nRain caused the match between Hampshire Hawks and Sussex Sharks to be abandoned. Despite the fact that a ball was not bowled, the match was declared a no-result since a toss was made.\nEssex v Sussex (26 June).\nEssex (2pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 43 runs\nAfter Johannes van der Wath had given Sussex Sharks the edge with two early wickets against Essex Eagles, Andy Flower and Ryan ten Doeschate rebuilt to send the hosts to 151 for 5 after their 20 overs. Sussex, however, imploded following the departure of Chris Adams for 44, as Grant Flower took three quick wickets, and James Middlebrook and Andre Adams mopped up the tail for just 108.\nSussex v Surrey (29 June).\nSurrey (2pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by 5 wickets (D/L method)\nA close, rain-damaged match at The County Ground, Hove eventually ended in Surrey Lions snaring a last-ball victory over Sussex Sharks. Batting first, the hosts made 139 for 6 in 17 overs, spinner Nayan Doshi taking three wickets despite being the most expensive of the bowlers, while Matt Prior top-scored with 51. A 28-ball fifty from Ali Brown then lifted Surrey to 74 for 1, but two run outs saw them lose their next four wickets for eight runs. Azhar Mahmood and Ian Salisbury, however, shared a 36-run partnership and saw them pass the revised target of 114 by two runs on the very last ball of the game.\nSussex v Hampshire (1 July).\nSussex (2pts) beat Hampshire (0pts) by 10 runs\nA twelve-over game at Hove was won by Sussex Sharks, though the rain threatened to destroy it all. Ian Ward and Matt Prior opened the batting for Sussex, who had been sent in to bat by Hampshire Hawks' captain Shaun Udal, and they made good use of it, sending Sussex to 53 for 0. Two quick wickets from Sean Ervine slowed the Sharks' progression, as they slumped to 88 for 5, but Michael Yardy hit 10 in four balls in an unbeaten 11-run sixth-wicket stand with Carl Hopkinson. Chasing, Hampshire never quite kept up with the required run rate, as Mushtaq Ahmed took three for 19 in his three overs to be the main cause of the Hawks' demise, and Hampshire finished on 89 for 6.\nSussex v Middlesex (4 July).\nNo result; Sussex (1pt), Middlesex (1pt)\nSeven overs of play was possible at The County Ground, Hove, before rain intervened. Owais Shah made 30 not out off 20 balls to see Middlesex Crusaders to a healthy 56 for 1, but Sussex Sharks never got the chance to chase as the game was abandoned.\nKent v Sussex (5 July).\nNo result; Kent (1pt), Sussex (1pt)\nIn eleven overs of play, Kent Spitfires moved to 91 for 1, Andrew Hall making 43 not out as Sussex Sharks' new man, Pakistani Naved-ul-Hasan made his debut with nought for 10 in two overs. Then, rain made play impossible.\nSurrey v Sussex (6 July).\nSussex (2pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by three wickets\nSurrey Lions were consistently pegged back by the Sussex Sharks' bowling at The Oval, having been put in to bat by Sussex captain Chris Adams. Azhar Mahmood stood firm and knocked off 40 unbeaten runs, but Naved-ul-Hasan, James Kirtley and Mushtaq Ahmed all got two wickets for less than six runs an over as Surrey eventually had to settle for 144 for 8. In reply, Ian Ward made a quickfire 50, off 28 balls, before being bowled by Surrey off-spinner Nayan Doshi to send Sussex to 82 for 3. Adams and Murray Goodwin both made 28, while Azhar Mahmood took two for 21 from four overs. Eventually, a six from Naved-ul-Hasan won Sussex the game with three balls to spare to put them third in the table, but as they were the poorest third-placed side in the competition with only three wins, they were still knocked out.\nSussex v Kent (8 July).\nSussex (4pts) beat Kent (0pts) by four wickets\nSussex Sharks regained the lead in Division Two of the National League with a win over Kent Spitfires in a low-scoring match at The County Ground, Hove. Sussex' Pakistani cricketers Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed took three and two wickets respectively, reducing Kent to 106 for 7, before James Kirtley mopped up the tail with three balls remaining of Kent's innings, for 155. Then, a fiery opening spell from Simon Cook, who had hit an unbeaten 28 with the bat, resulted in three quick wickets (he ended with excellent figures of three for 15 off nine overs) and sent Sussex down to 22 for 4. However, Michael Yardy and Carl Hopkinson paired up for 103 for the fifth wicket, and Yardy's 65 anchored a nervy chase as Sussex reached the target with 3.3 overs remaining.\nKent v Sussex (10–13 July).\nSussex (21pts) beat Kent (6pts) by 66 runs\nSussex took hand of a see-sawing match at Canterbury, mainly thanks to their Pakistani overseas players Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed, who took fourteen wickets between them. The hosts Kent won the toss and put Sussex in to bat, and after an initial opening partnership of 65, two wickets fell quickly. However, an opener Ian Ward completed his century, and 63 from Murray Goodwin swung it Sussex's way to 210 for 2 before South African all-rounder Andrew Hall took two quick wickets. Sussex quickly slumped to 298 for 8, but captain Chris Adams stood firm, making 83 as Sussex batted into the second day – making 378 in the end. Curiously, Simon Cook of Kent bowled eleven maidens in 24 overs, but conceded 57 runs in the other 13.\nKent looked to be well on the way to posting a challenging total, as they were on 323 for 6 at stumps on day 2, with four of their batsmen making fifties. However, day three saw a total of twenty wickets tumble. First, Kent lost four wickets to be all out for 348, trailing by 30. Then, after Michael Yardy and Goodwin had rescued to Sussex to 89 for 2 after both openers had been removed for sub-20 scores, Sussex fell apart. Min Patel ran through the middle-order, Dane Amjad Khan took care of the tail, and Sussex were all out for 155, setting a target of 186. However, accurate bowling was enough to undo Kent, as no Kent batsmen passed 35 and Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed shared eight wickets – Kent were all out for 119, but retained the County Championship lead, as their closest competitors failed to win.\nLancashire v Sussex (15 July).\nLancashire beat Sussex by 35 runs to progress to the Semi-Finals of the C&amp;G Trophy\nAndrew Symonds scored 101 and took two wickets for 46 to be the difference between the sides at Old Trafford. Having been sent in to bat, Lancashire owed much of their success to a partnership of 118 between Symonds and Marcus North, and good lower-order hitting took the total to 249 for 8, despite three wickets each from Sussex' Pakistanis, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed. The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were just waiting for opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.\nHampshire v Sussex (20–23 July).\nHampshire (19.5pts) beat Sussex (6pts) by 35 runs\nHampshire's veteran wicketkeeper Nic Pothas made his way to a four-hour 135, his twelfth first-class century, after Jason Lewry, James Kirtley and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan had reduced Hampshire to 102 for 6 in the middle of the afternoon session on the first day. Pothas was well supported by Zimbabwean Sean Ervine, who made 69, and the pair added 191 in three hours before Naved-ul-Hasan broke through with the last ball of the day, having Ervine caught by Ian Ward. Hampshire slumped to 309 on the morning of day two, and solid contributions from the entire batting order – bar number three Michael Yardy who made a duck – lifted Sussex to a slender seven-run lead amid Ervine's swing bowling, which yielded five wickets for 73. However, Mushtaq Ahmed got the early breakthrough for Sussex, and James Kirtley ripped out two quick wickets as Hampshire folded to 22 for 3 overnight.\nKirtley and Naved-ul-Hasan continued to pile on the pressure on the third morning, as they eked out two catches and reduced Hampshire to 28 for 5, a lead of 21. However, once again, the all-rounders fought back. Australian Shane Watson made 82, while Pothas added 74, and number 11 Chris Tremlett made an unbeaten 44 to ensure that Hampshire set a competitive target of 271, despite Kirtley's five for 67. Ian Ward made 60 and Murray Goodwin an unbeaten 51 as Sussex cruised to 167 for 3 after only 38 overs on day three, needing 104 more to win on the fourth day.\nGoodwin added 20 more on the final morning before Dimitri Mascarenhas snared him out, but he had stood tall in Mascarenhas' early spell on the morning of day 4, which had yielded three wickets for two runs. Goodwin was eventually caught by Greg Lamb, but Sussex still needed only 55 for the last three wickets – however, Sean Ervine added the wickets of Pakistanis Rana and Ahmed to his tally to help bowl Sussex out for 235. Thus, Hampshire took the victory in a closely contested game, although they were later deducted half a point for a slow over rate.\nSurrey v Sussex (24 July).\nSussex (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by 48 runs\nAn interesting match at Guildford was shortened to 22 overs a side due to rain. However, the scores were similar to what could have been in a 45-over game, as Sussex Sharks amassed 219 for 9 – Murray Goodwin top-scoring with 44, while Luke Wright plundered three sixes in a 14-ball 35. The Surrey bowlers all got wickets – except for Ian Salisbury – but also conceded more than seven runs an over. A Surrey Lions side including three debutants – Stewart Walters, Rory Hamilton-Brown and Jake Dernbach – crumbled despite the efforts of Mark Ramprakash who made 63, as they were all out for 171.\nSussex v Gloucestershire (26–29 July).\nSussex (7pts) drew with Gloucestershire (7pts)\nRain damaged both the first and the second day at The County Ground, Hove, and only 93 overs were possible in two days. Yet, 18 wickets fell on those two days, 14 of which on the second day. Sussex resumed play on the second day with an overnight score of 97 for 4, and immediately lost two wickets to swing bowler Jon Lewis, who ended with four for 62. However, a quick blast of four fours, one six and one single from Jason Lewry lifted Sussex to 191 all out. The Gloucestershire reply never got off the mark, as seven batsmen were out in single figures and the highest partnership was 33. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan got good output with the ball, however, taking four for 26 as Gloucestershire ended on 142.\nDespite early breakthroughs from Lewis and Steve Kirby Sussex fought back, as Michael Yardy, Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams all passed 40 to see Sussex to 200 for 4 at stumps on day three. Lewis took four wickets on the fourth morning to bowl Sussex out for 267, Yardy completing his century before he was caught off Ian Fisher, setting up a potentially exciting finish with 317 required off 74 overs. Gloucestershire never attempted the chase, however, and Sussex failed to get them out, despite 19 overs of spin from Mushtaq Ahmed which yielded three wickets for 25.\nSussex v Somerset (1 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Somerset (0pts) by 11 runs\nRichard Montgomerie and Matt Prior opened the batting with a partnership of 13, and Murray Goodwin added a further 97 with Montgomerie for the third wicket, as Sussex Sharks made 266 for 3 in their 45 overs. Montgomerie's 132 not out was his highest List A score Somerset Sabres lost wickets regularly, and despite dispatching Mushtaq Ahmed for 70 in 9 overs, they finished on 255 for 9 – Michael Yardy taking four for 26, while Ian Blackwell top-scored for Somerset with 57.\nSussex v Surrey (3–5 August).\nSussex (21pts) beat Surrey (4pts) by five wickets\nSurrey won the toss at Hove against Sussex, and chose to bat – and lost the wickets of both their openers in the first 20 minutes to fall to seven for two. Mark Ramprakash, Rikki Clarke and Jonathan Batty steadied the ship, and Surrey made their way to 157 for 3, only for all-rounder Robin Martin-Jenkins to snare a couple of wickets and incite a collapse to 187 for 8. Azhar Mahmood's quickfire 57 not out lifted them to 248, but Sussex posted 67 for the first wicket, and despite by four wickets from Azhar which sent the hosts to 180 for 6, Martin-Jenkins made 88 from number eight to help Sussex to 378 and a lead of 130.\nOpeners Scott Newman and Richard Clinton made up for their first-innings failure and batted 22 overs until stumps on day two without giving away their wickets, but on the third morning James Kirtley got the vital breakthrough, having Clinton caught for 12 off 79 balls. Rikki Clarke's 75 led Surrey to set a target, at least, as the Pakistanis dominated – Naved-ul-Hasan got four for 70 and Mushtaq Ahmed three for 96. Surrey had some Pakistanis of their own, as Azhar Mahmood and Mohammad Akram took two and one wicket respectively, and Sussex scrambled to 33 for 4 at tea on day 3, chasing a meagre 125 to win. After tea, however, Michael Yardy and Matt Prior attacked Nayan Doshi with fury – Prior finishing with 66 not out off just 48 balls – as Sussex eased to the target with five wickets to spare, losing Yardy for 35 but still holding out for the win.\nSussex v Leicestershire (7 August).\nLeicestershire (4pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by six wickets\nLeicestershire Foxes eked out a last-ball victory over Sussex Sharks to tighten up the title battle in Division Two of the National League. Batting first, Sussex were tied down by Ottis Gibson, as the Barbadian seamer took four for 37 with three maidens in his nine overs. Chris Adams top-scored with 78, while Rana Naved-ul-Hasan blasted 45 off just 31 balls to propel Sussex to a competitive 223 for 8. Sussex fast bowler James Kirtley then bowled a maiden to begin Leicestershire's innings, and had Tom New caught for an eight-ball duck later. However, Darren Maddy and HD Ackerman added 185 for the second wicket, and despite wickets tumbling around him, Ackerman finished on an unbeaten 114, hitting the winning four off the last ball.\nGloucestershire v Sussex (10–13 August).\nSussex (21pts) beat Gloucestershire (4pts) by 226 runs\nSussex recorded a comfortable win at Bristol against Gloucestershire, to escape further from the relegation zone – in a match completely dominated by Sussex' overseas bowlers. Murray Goodwin, Chris Adams and Matt Prior all made quick half-centuries, to propel Sussex to 365, while the Gloucestershire spinners shared seven wickets – Malinga Bandara taking four for 64 and Ian Fisher three for 93. Indeed, spinners were to take the brunt of the bowling, as Gloucestershire had only gone in with two specialist seamers – and one of them, Steve Kirby, broke down with an injury in his fifth over of the day.\nGloucestershire resumed the second day on 28 for 1, and players from the Indian subcontinent were to dominate the day's proceedings, as they took all of the thirteen wickets. Sussex' Pakistani spinner Mushtaq Ahmed took six for 65, while Rana Naved-ul-Hasan added three to his overnight tally of one to end with four for 53. No Gloucestershire batsman passed 50, as they trailed by 141 on first innings. Sussex took on seven overs from the seamers, before Michael Ball and Bandara started another marathon spell. The openers survived to pair up for 67, but then Bandara took a burst of wickets, finishing the day with four for 58 as Sussex closed the second day's play on 128 for 4.\nOn the third day, Prior and Michael Yardy made a fifth wicket-partnership worth 141 runs, and Sussex could declare with a lead of 405 runs, after Bandara was taken for runs to end with the expensive innings bowling analysis of 26–3–112–4. Again, Gloucestershire subsided to the Pakistani bowlers, but for once an English-born bowler got his name up on Gloucestershire's scorecard – Alex Gidman was lbw to James Kirtley for 7. Rana took five and Mushtaq three as Gloucestershire collapsed to 179, Ramnaresh Sarwan making 117 of those.\nDerbyshire v Sussex (14 August).\nDerbyshire (4pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by three runs\nMichael di Venuto made 129 not out, his third one-day century this season, to lift Derbyshire Phantoms to a final score of 232 for 3, which would turn out to be just enough to win the game. Sussex Sharks were looking to win and open a gap at the top of the league, and with ten runs needed with three wickets in hand and at least two overs remaining, it looked like they would coast to victory. However, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan holed out a catch to Jon Moss, Mushtaq Ahmed could add no run from three balls, and in the end, James Kirtley was bowled by Moss on the last ball, with Kirtley needing to hit a boundary to win the game.\nMiddlesex v Sussex (16–17 August).\nSussex (22pts) beat Middlesex (3pts) by an innings and 232 runs\nSussex enjoyed their highest victory all season by defeating Middlesex at Lord's, after Rana Naved-ul-Hasan came in at eight to slash a first class best 139. His seventh-wicket partnership with Michael Yardy was worth 228 runs in just two and a half hours, after the first six wickets had been lost for 199 runs. With Mark Davis scoring a quickfire 50 as well, Sussex went to stumps on day one with the score 522 for 9 – with the run rate at just over five an over. Middlesex' Stuart Clark got Davis out with the fourth ball of the morning, but from then on everything went downhill. Once again, just like against Gloucestershire the previous week, Rana and Mushtaq Ahmed went berserk on the opposing batting line-ups, as Rana removed the top three batsmen and Mushtaq the next three as Middlesex crashed to 87 for 6. Then, after a brief period of calm where Ben Scott and Chris Peploe added 23 runs, Robin Martin-Jenkins broke through and Middlesex lost three wickets for three runs. Middlesex finished their first innings on 128 – Martin-Jenkins taking the last wicket to end with four for 31 – and were forced to follow on, trailing by 394 runs on first innings.\nEd Smith and Ben Hutton forged Middlesex' biggest partnership of the match so far, with 45 runs, before the wheels fell off once again. Mushtaq took three wickets in an over, and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan removed four batsmen for ducks in another frantic over, as Middlesex imploded from 45 for 0 to 48 for 7. Smith tried to force Sussex to bat again at least, batting for three hours to make 69, but Mushtaq got another three wickets to end with six for 44, and Middlesex collapsed to a total of 162. Pakistani bowlers took a total of 16 wickets for Sussex – in the last Championship game they had taken 18.\nLeicestershire v Sussex (21 August).\nLeicestershire (4pts) beat Sussex (0pts) by five wickets\nLeicestershire Foxes recorded their second win over Sussex Sharks in two weeks to close the gap at the top of Division Two of the National League to two points. Having been put in the field by the Sussex captain Chris Adams, Leicestershire grabbed the first four wickets for 44 runs, and despite a 72-run fifth-wicket partnership between Michael Yardy and Carl Hopkinson, Sussex could only muster 186 all out – Dinesh Mongia taking the last two wickets, while conceding 17 from two overs. Mongia also contributed with the bat – after the Sussex bowlers had made things tricky for Leicestershire's top order, reducing them to 27 for 2 and then 103 for 5, Mongia remained at the crease to make 92 at just under a run a ball to see Leicestershire past the target with seven balls to spare.\nWarwickshire v Sussex (23 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Warwickshire (0pts) by five wickets\nSussex Sharks opened up a four-point gap after a spell of left-arm spin bowling from Michael Yardy yielded the last six wickets of Warwickshire Bears' innings for 27 runs, the best bowling figures in Division Two of the National League all season. Earlier, Sussex pacer Rana Naved-ul-Hasan had made inroads with three wickets for 25, and it was only the 73-run partnership between Alex Loudon and Michael Powell that got Warwickshire past 100. Yardy's six-for left Warwickshire all out for 169, however, and in the chase Sussex were troubled by Makhaya Ntini's fast bowling as both opening batsmen were removed and Sussex crumbled to 16 for 2. However, Zimbabwean Murray Goodwin scored a solid, two-hour 86 not out, and guided the team to the target, putting on 82 with Robin Martin-Jenkins after spinner Alex Loudon had taken two wickets to set Sussex back to 91 for 5.\nWarwickshire v Sussex (25–28 August).\nWarwickshire (22pts) beat Sussex (8pts) by 101 runs\nFor once, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan went wicketless on the first day, and thus Sussex lost the match and the Championship lead at Edgbaston. Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott, who had made a career best 152 two weeks previously, now notched up his third first class century of the season as he carried his team to 329 for 7 on the first day. Trott continued on the second, and was eventually last out, having shattered his previous highest score and gone on to make 210 before he was bowled by Rana. Warwickshire were thus all out for 475, Mushtaq Ahmed and James Kirtley taking three wickets each, and Warwickshire got a good start with the ball as Makhaya Ntini and Dougie Brown removed an opener each. However, Michael Yardy, Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams all made solid contributions as Sussex moved to 244 for 3 at stumps on day two.\nThe third day saw a total of sixteen wickets fall, as Sussex came back to dismiss Warwickshire for a low score after giving up a 47-run lead on first innings. Goodwin made 150, his fourth century of the season, as Sussex scored 428, while most of the Warwickshire bowlers got wickets but conceded plenty of runs in the process. Then, Rana set out to repair his poor first innings effort, taking four wickets in 15 overs as Warwickshire could only muster 180 – and that was mostly thanks to a 50-run partnership between Trevor Frost and Brown. Sussex needed 228 to win, but collapsed. Wickets were shared out among the entire Warwickshire team, James Anyon getting the most with four for 33, and Makhaya Ntini, Neil Carter and Alex Loudon also got two each, to see Sussex all out for 126.\nSussex v Scotland (30 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Scotland (0pts) by seven wickets\nRana Naved-ul-Hasan's pace bowling was too much to handle for the Scottish Saltires, as they whimpered to 132 all out despite Jonathan Beukes making 51. None of the other batsmen passed 20, as Rana took five for 30 from his nine overs, while James Kirtley bowled tightly to end with a bowling analysis of 8.5–3–8–2. Sussex Sharks strolled to the target in just over half the allotted time, Matt Prior smashing thirteen fours and one six in a fifty-ball 69, while Sean Weeraratna took two for 20 for the Scots. (Cricinfo scorecard)\nSussex v Surrey (31 August).\nSussex (4pts) beat Surrey (0pts) by two wickets\nMushtaq Ahmed sealed a last-ball victory for Sussex Sharks in a closely fought match at The County Ground, Hove, against mid-table languishers Surrey Lions. The visitors had opted to bat first, and lost three early wickets for 40 runs, but a calm rearguard from Mark Ramprakash set the stage for some fours from Azhar Mahmood near the end. Surrey finished on 230 for 6, and got a good start when Azhar dismissed Robin Montgomerie for 0. A quick 42 from Matt Prior, however, gave Sussex hope of chasing the target, and despite wickets falling regularly Sussex kept the required rate below seven an over, with captain Chris Adams keeping the innings together with his unbeaten 110. Mushtaq eventually faced the final ball of the match, and he hit it to the boundary, which gave Sussex the win and extended their Division Two lead to ten points.\nSussex v Glamorgan (7–8 September).\nSussex (20pts) beat Glamorgan (5pts) by nine wickets\nDavid Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan made their way to a relatively competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2, with the match finely poised at the end of the first day. However, nineteen wickets tumbled on the second day, as Sussex took the victory one would expect from the relative table positions of the two sides. They lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan crashed to 22 for 3, only to see a small rebuilding effort. But a good bowling effort from Mushtaq and Rana saw Glamorgan crash from 73 for 4 to 78 for 9 as four batsmen were out for ducks. Opener David Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 in just 28 overs – Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex chased 35 to win with ease, losing only Ward in a nine-wicket victory.\nKent v Sussex (18 September).\nSussex (4pts) beat Kent (0pts) by 61 runs\nSussex Sharks were put in to bat at St Lawrence Ground, and although they lost nine wickets, they still managed 230 runs in their 45 overs. Chris Adams and Robin Montgomerie put on 111 for the second wicket after Matt Prior was caught behind for 4, and although five wickets fell for 42 in a period which saw them to 209 for 8, Carl Hopkinson and Mushtaq Ahmed added 21 for the ninth wicket. Kent Spitfires' innings started with losing Neil Dexter for a five-ball duck, bowled by James Kirtley, and Robin Martin-Jenkins had three men caught as Kent lost their first five wickets for 48. Despite 51 from Michael Carberry Kent never got anywhere near the target, Kirtley taking the final wickets as Kent finished on 169.\nSussex v Kent (21–23 September).\nSussex (20pts) beat Kent (5pts) by eight wickets\nSussex' three main bowlers won them the game at Hove against Kent – James Kirtley took seven for 103, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan six for 124, and Mushtaq Ahmed five for 173 in the match, as Sussex took an eight-wicket victory. Sussex took three wickets in the first 45 minutes, courtesy of Kirtley and Rana, and for only 28 runs in reply. Matthew Walker and Darren Stevens added 52 together for the fourth wicket, but it was the half-centuries from Min Patel and Niall O'Brien – his second in successive matches – that carried Kent past 200. They finished on 257, with Kirtley and Naved-ul-Hasan taking four wickets each, while Mushtaq had to be content with two for 81 from nearly 28 overs. Sussex, however, ground out 47 for 2 wickets in the 23 remaining overs, the Kent spinners Patel and Jamie Tredwell keeping them from scoring.\nOn the second day, Sussex accelerated, but after five wickets from Patel they were 192 for 8, still trailing by 65. However, Mushtaq forged partnerships of 86 and 74 with Luke Wright and James Kirtley respectively, hitting an unbeaten 90 himself as Sussex ended on 348. Kent trailed by 89, and in the second innings Robert Key hit eleven fours in a two-hour 84, but he was dismissed by Robin Martin-Jenkins just before the close of the second day's play to leave Kent with a lead of 53 with seven wickets in hand. Kirtley, Rana and Mushtaq removed the last seven wickets for 94 runs on day three, leaving Sussex 148 to chase, which they did inside two hours thanks to half-centuries from Carl Hopkinson and Michael Yardy.\nSussex v Yorkshire (25 September).\nSussex (4pts) beat Yorkshire (0pts) by eight wickets\nSussex Sharks sealed the National League Division Two title by fielding first and bowling Yorkshire Phoenix out for 99. Only wicket-keeper Simon Guy passed 20, as Yorkshire fell in two periods – first to 37 for 5 thanks to three wickets from Luke Wright, and then, after Guy, Anthony McGrath and Mark Cleary had taken them to 90 for 6, they lost their last four men for nine runs. Sussex captain Chris Adams took his time in the reply, using 83 balls to hit 49 as Sussex' batsmen rode home to an eight-wicket victory."

        "text": "Aaron Garcia (born October 28, 1970) is a former professional American football quarterback who played 19 seasons in the Arena Football League (AFL), from 1995 to 2014. He played college football at Washington State University before transferring to California State University, Sacramento. After retiring from the AFL, Garcia was named the head coach of the Las Vegas Outlaws in September 2014, and was formally introduced as the head coach of the Outlaws on October 11, 2014. Garcia is married to Bryn Garcia and has five children, Gigi, Bella, Anthony, Christian, and Jaxon.\nBorn in Sacramento, California, Garcia attended high school in Sacramento at Grant Union High School. After graduation from high school in 1988, Garcia enrolled at Washington State University and played quarterback for the Cougars, starting for two seasons. He transferred to California State University, Sacramento in 1992, where he started for two seasons.\nAfter going undrafted in the 1995 NFL Draft, Garcia was encouraged to try playing in the Canadian Football League (CFL) or the AFL to gain more scouting exposure for an opportunity at the National Football League (NFL). He signed with the Arizona Rattlers and became their starting quarterback in 1995. In his career, Garcia has also played for the Connecticut Coyotes, New Jersey Red Dogs, Iowa Barnstormers, New York Dragons, Jacksonville Sharks, San Antonio Talons, San Jose SaberCats Orlando Predators and Los Angeles KISS. Garcia would go on to set AFL records for passing yards, passing touchdowns and interceptions during his 19-year career, winning ArenaBowl XXIV while a member of the Sharks. Garcia was also a two-time Arena Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award recipient, in 2001 and 2011.\nHigh school career.\nGarcia attended Grant Union High School where he played high school football, and basketball with his father as coach, where he broke John Elway’s California state high school passing, yardage and touchdown records with a two-year prep total of 5,800 yards and 57 touchdown passes.\nCollege career.\nGarcia went to Washington State University in 1988, and started as a redshirt freshman in 1989, contributing 1,591 yards and 11 touchdown passes, leading the Pac-10 in passing efficiency that year. During that year, quarterbacking duties also were shared by junior Brad Gossen, who threw for 1,372 yards and nine touchdowns in an injury shortened season, prior to Garcia being named the starter. In 1990, a mid-season quarterback controversy erupted when second-year coach Mike Price benched veterans Gossen and Garcia in favor of true-freshman Drew Bledsoe.\nAfter Bledsoe's emergence at Washington State in 1990, Garcia transferred to Sacramento State in Division I-AA and finished his college football career as the starter there, throwing for 1,796 yards and 13 touchdowns in his senior season.\nProfessional career.\nArizona Rattlers.\nFollowing his college career, Garcia turned to Arena Football. He played for the Arizona Rattlers in 1995.\nConnecticut Coyotes.\nGarcia was traded to the Connecticut Coyotes during the 1996 season.\nNew Jersey Red Dogs.\nGarcia would change teams again in 1997, playing for the New Jersey Red Dogs.\nIowa Barnstomers / New York Dragons.\nGarcia played for the Red Dogs for a year and a half before joining the Iowa Barnstormers during the 1998 season. Garcia finally settled down in Iowa, and found his greatest success when the Barnstormers became the New York Dragons in 2001. In the 2001 season, Garcia threw a league record 104 touchdown passes, but this was passed by Clint Dolezel in 2006.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nGarcia briefly left the AFL in 2002, when he was signed by the NFL's San Francisco 49ers. He was released after minicamp in June and returned to the Dragons, who finished 3–11 that year.\nNew York Dragons (second stint).\nOn February 26, 2006, Garcia suffered a fractured tibia and fibula, ending his season. He was replaced by Juston Wood and later Nick Browder. At the time of the injury, Garcia had thrown more touchdown passes than any pro quarterback, however, Andy Kelly and Clint Dolezel moved ahead of Garcia while he was injured.\nOn June 2, 2007, Garcia became the fourth quarterback in AFL history to throw 800 touchdowns, joining Dolezel, Sherdrick Bonner, and Kelly.\nIn 2008, Garcia led the Dragons to the playoffs despite finishing the season with an 8-8 record. In the first round playoff game, Garcia and the Dragons defeated a heavily favored Dallas Desperados team who finished the year at 12-4. Garcia and Dolezel squared off at quarterback against each other, and Garcia out dueled Dolezel throwing nine touchdown passes to Dolezel's seven. The following week, New York lost on the final play of the game to the Philadelphia Soul, who would go on to win ArenaBowl XXII.\nJacksonville Sharks.\nThe Arena Football League suspended operations in 2009. On January 21, 2010, Garcia signed with the expansion Jacksonville Sharks when the Arena Football League reformed in 2010. On May 1, 2010, Garcia threw his 900th touchdown pass to Sale' Key in a 62-60 win over the Tulsa Talons. On June 5, 2010, Garcia became the all-time leader in passing touchdowns in Arena Football history, with 932 touchdown passes thrown. On April 30, 2011, Garcia connected with Jeron Harvey for his 1,000th career touchdown pass. Jacksonville Sharks went on to beat in-state rival Orlando Predators 76-55. On July 22, 2011, Garcia became the first AFL quarterback to cross the 50,000 yard milestone in a 75-56 victory over the Spokane Shock. On August 12, 2011, with two seconds remaining in the 4th quarter, Garcia threw the winning touchdown pass as time expired in ArenaBowl XXIV to win his first Arena Bowl title for the Jacksonville Sharks.\nSan Antonio Talons.\nOn September 27, 2011, Garcia was officially announced as the first player to sign with the relocated San Antonio Talons franchise.\nOn March 29, 2012, Garcia was strip sacked on the six yard line but was able to recover the ball and go into the end zone for a fumble recovery score in a 47-34 road victory over the Orlando Predators. Garcia lead the Talons to a 14-4 record, and a Central Division Championship. With the top seed in the National Conference, the Talons were upset 35-34 by the Utah Blaze after Garcia was sacked on 4th and goal with 2:50 remaining in the game. After the 2012 season, the Talons offered a contract to Garcia, but Garcia decided to sign elsewhere.\nSan Jose SaberCats.\nOn November 8, 2012, Garcia signed with the San Jose Sabercats. On April 22, 2013, after a slow start to the 2013 season (98 for 159, 24 TD's and 13 INT's) the SaberCats announced that they have been assigned former Chicago Rush quarterback Russ Michna on a two-year contract. The SaberCats then placed Garcia on recallable reassignment to make room on the 24-man roster.\nOrlando Predators.\nOn April 25, 2013, Garcia was traded, along with Devin Clark, to the Orlando Predators in exchange for Amarri Jackson.\nJacksonville Sharks (second stint).\nOn February 8, 2014, Garcia was traded back to Jacksonville for Bernard Morris, Matt Marcorelle and Trevis Turner. Garcia started one game for the Sharks, while refusing to report for most of the season.\nLos Angeles KISS.\nOn May 12, 2014, Garcia was traded to the Los Angeles KISS for J. J. Raterink.\nCoaching career.\nGarcia was named head coach of the Las Vegas Outlaws of the AFL in September 2014. The Outlaws folded in August 2015."

        "title": "Mountains classification in the Tour de France",
        "text": "The mountains classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1933. It is given to the rider that gains the most points for reaching mountain summits first. The leader of the classification is named the King of the Mountains, and since 1975 wears the polka dot jersey (), a white jersey with red polka dots.\nHistory.\nThe first Tour de France crossed no mountain passes, but several lesser cols. The first was the col des Echarmeaux (), on the opening stage from Paris to Lyon, on what is now the old road from Autun to Lyon. The stage from Lyon to Marseille included the col de la République (), also known as the col du Grand Bois, at the edge of St-Etienne. The first major climb—the Ballon d'Alsace () in the Vosges — was featured in the 1905 race.\nTrue mountains were not included until the Pyrenees in 1910. In that year the race rode, or more walked, first the col d'Aubisque and then the nearby Tourmalet. Both climbs were mule tracks, a demanding challenge on heavy, ungeared bikes ridden by men with spare tires around their shoulders and their food, clothing and tools in bags hung from their handlebars. The assistant organiser, Victor Breyer, stood at the summit of the Aubisque with the colleague who had proposed including the Pyrenees, Alphonse Steinès. The tour organiser, Henri Desgrange was confident enough after the Pyrenees to include the Alps in 1911.\nThe highest climb in the race was the Cime de la Bonette-Restefond in the 1962 Tour de France, reaching 2802 m. The highest mountain finish in the Tour was at the Col du Galibier in the 2011 edition.\nSince 1905, the organising newspaper \"l'Auto\" named one cyclist of the Tour de France the \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber). In 1933, Vicente Trueba was the winner of this classification. In order to recognize climbers, the Tour de France director, Henri Desgrange, decided that cyclists should receive a bonus for reaching the tops first. From 1934 on, the gap between the first and the second cyclist to reach the top was given as a time bonus to the one reaching the top first. These time bonuses were later removed, but the King of the Mountain recognition remained. Although the best climber was first recognised in 1933, the distinctive jersey was not introduced until 1975, as the sponsor, Chocolat Poulain, wanted to enhance the visibility of the jersey in the peloton. The Tour's organizer Félix Lévitan decided to use the jersey used by the cyclist Henri Lemoine as a tribute to him. As a consequence, the sponsor, Chocolat Poulain, decided to change its wrappings of chocolate bars and covered them in a polka dot wrapper. \nThe first rider to ever wear the Polka Dot Jersey, during the 1975 Tour de France, was Joop Zoetemelk, and while he never won the King of the Mountains competition in the Tour De France he is considered to be one of the greatest climbers in Tour de France history. Zoetemelk did win the mountains classification in the 1971 Vuelta a España, as well as the general classification in the 1979 Vuelta a España and the 1980 Tour de France.\nSponsorship.\nThe polka dots originate from sponsor Chocolat Poulain. Between 1993 and 2018, the jersey was sponsored by Carrefour supermarkets, initially under the Champion brand, and later under the main Carrefour brand from the 2009 edition of the Tour. Since 2019, the jersey is sponsored by E.Leclerc supermarkets.\nJerseys ranking.\nThe polka dot jersey is the third most important jersey in the Tour de France, third to yellow and green jerseys. If a rider is the leader in the general and/or points classifications and in the mountain classification he will wear the yellow or green jersey. The second rider (or the following eligible rider) in the mountain classification will wear polka dot jersey with some exceptions:\nIn both case the third rider (or the following eligible rider) will be in polka dot jersey.\nCurrent situation.\nAt the top of many climbs in the Tour, there are points for the riders who are first over the top. The climbs are divided into categories from 1 (most difficult) to 4 (least difficult) based on their difficulty, measured as a function of their steepness, length, location within the stage (near the start or end), and location in the overall race (early in the race or toward the end). A few of the toughest climbs were originally given different individual points scales, and were thus listed as \"uncategorised\" (\"Hors catégorie\", a term that has since passed into the French language to refer to any exceptional phenomenon); however, since the 1980s, the \"hors catégorie\" climbs have been merged into the single scale and have effectively become, despite the name, just a top category above category 1. In 2004, the scoring system was changed such that the first rider over a fourth category climb would be awarded 3 points while the first to complete a \"hors catégorie\" climb would be awarded 20 points. Further points over a fourth category climb are only for the top three places while on a \"hors catégorie\" climb the top ten riders are rewarded. From 2004 to 2021, points scored on the final climb of the day were doubled where that climb was at least a second category climb. In 2022 and 2023, mountain-top finishes were worth the same number of points as any other climb.\nDistribution of points.\nThe points gained by consecutive riders reaching a mountain top are distributed according to the following classification:\nFor 2020, \"Double points will be awarded at the top of passes or at the finish of stage 17 at Méribel Col de la Loze, the highest peak in the 2020 Tour (2,304 masl)\". The organisation of the race determines which mountains are included for the mountains classification and in which category they are.\nIf two riders have an equal number of points, the rider with the most first places on the \"hors catégorie\" cols, is declared winner. If the riders arrived first an equal number of times, the first places on the 1st category cols are compared. Should the two riders again have an equal number of first arrivals in this category, the organization looks at mutual results in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th category, until a winner is found. If the number of first arrivals in all categories is equal for both riders, the rider with the highest position in the overall list of rankings receives the mountain jersey.\nUp until 2011 the points that are gained by climbing the mountains were distributed according to the following classification:\nCriticism of the system.\nThe system has faced criticism. Six-time winner Lucien Van Impe said in 2010 that the mountain jersey has been devalued, because it goes to cyclists who have no hope of winning the general classification and are therefore allowed to escape and gather points in breakaways by the general classification contenders. According to Van Impe, focusing on the mountain classification was started by cyclists such as Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque, but compared to modern mountain classification specialists, \"they could really climb, and they could win sprints on hors category climbs or even win the stage\". However, in 2020, 2021, and 2022, the mountain classification winner also won the general classification.\nWinners.\n\"Meilleurs grimpeurs (top climbers)\".\nThis list shows the cyclists who were chosen \"meilleur grimpeur\" by the newspaper \"L'Auto\". Although \"L'Auto\" was organising the Tour de France, the \"meilleur grimpeur\" title was not given by the tour organisation, so it is unofficial. However, it is a direct predecessor of the later King of the Mountains title.\nWinners of the general and mountain classification in the same year.\nSome cyclists have won both the general classification and the mountains classification in the same year.\nIn the early years of the Tour, only the highest mountains gave points. Cyclists aiming for the Tour win generally did well on those mountains, so the riders high in the general classification were typically also high in the mountains classification, which made the double more likely. Later, the rules of the mountains classification changed, giving more points to mountains of lower category. The cyclists aiming to win the general classification did not spend energy on those lower category mountains, and thus other cyclists could aim for the mountains classification win. In 1969, Eddy Merckx won not only the general classification and the mountains classification, but also the points classification.\nThe general classification and the mountain classification were won by the same rider twelve times, by eight different cyclists:\nDays in polka dot jersey.\n\"after the end of 2023 Tour de France\"\nThe classification existed since 1933. The polka dot jersey was issued since the 1975.\nRiders leaders in all stages of an edition.\nBefore 1975.\nIn some editions the Mountain Classification, without a distinctive jersey, was not compiled in the first stages (no points awarded in the first stages). Some riders led for all the stages after the first points were awarded:\n Félicien Vervaecke 1935 (first stage awarding points: 4th stage)\n Gino Bartali 1938 (first stage awarding points: 8th stage)\n Fausto Coppi 1949 (first stage awarding points: 11th stage)\n Federico Bahamontes 1954 (first stage awarding points: 11th stage)\n Federico Bahamontes 1958 (first stage awarding points: 13th stage)\n Federico Bahamontes 1963 (first stage awarding points: 10th stage)\nAfter 1975.\nNo riders wore the jersey in all stages of a single edition. Lucien Van Impe in 1977 wore it in most stages in a single edition: 25 of the 28 stages (but the jersey was not issued in the prologue). Bernard Vallet in 1982 lead the classification in all 21 numbered stages but not after the prologue."

        "title": "Mat (gymnastics)",
        "text": "Mats are used for safety in gymnastics, and in training new skills. They are usually a piece of foam (covered in leather) ranging from 1.5 to 28 inches thick, covered in a vinyl or plastic lining. The foam ranges in density from relatively firm to very soft.\nLanding mats are usually blue, but can also be almost any other color. Mats come in a range of sizes, from very small mats used on the beam, to very large mats, used in the foam pits.\nTypically, in both competition and practice, the use of mats is mandatory. On every event except floor exercise, pommel horse and vault, gymnasts may use an additional landing mat, without deduction, which may be adjusted for distance.\nTypes.\nBeam pads.\nThese are thin mats that fasten around the balance beam. They are used only in training to give gymnasts training high-level skills additional protection and a wider landing space while working on the apparatus. Makeshift beam pads can also be constructed from soft mats placed over the beam surface, if necessary.\nBlocks.\nBlocks are firm, trapezoid or rectangular shaped mats. They can be attached to other blocks via velcro and straps. Blocks are routinely used as step-stools for gymnasts working on the bars or beam and as practice vaulting surfaces.\nCrash mats.\nTypically, these mats are extremely thick and soft, and are used when an athlete is learning a new, high-impact skill.\nFolding panel mats.\nThese mats are thin, firm mats about twelve feet in length. They usually have alternating color panels and can be folded, stacked and attached to other mats via velcro strips at the ends. Normally used for practicing tumbling moves, these mats may be stacked to provide a protective surface for gymnasts working on the low balance beam, or provide a means for a gymnast to reach the bars or rings. They have a history of usage in gymnastics, martial arts and physical education classes. Schools generally purchase new folding mats once every 7 years. These mats are perfect for providing a level of protection for the body from high impact collisions with hard solid surfaces such as hardwood or concrete flooring. There are two main categories of foam used in these types of mats, cross-linked polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam.\nFoam core.\nPolyethylene foam.\nCross-linked polyethylene foam is a very solid and sturdy foam, when being used in a folding panel gym mat—it is generally accepted to be at a standard of 1 3/8\" thickness. Mats with this type of foam would be considered for professional use in sporting events.\nPolyurethane foam.\nThe foam is firm, but not as firm as the cross-linked polyethylene foam used in 1 3/8\" thick models. Because of the lack of firmness mats made with this type of foam generally use specifically 2\" thick 100 ILD open cell 4.5 lb. density polyurethane foam. Generally accepted uses of mats with this kind of foam are practice venues, home use, and youth amateur sports events.\nVinyls.\nEach mat although maybe of different foam generally have similar vinyl enclosures. 14 to 18 ounce polyester laminated vinyl is generally used in all folding mat applications. The vinyl covers should be fire-retardant (class - A), puncture and mildew resistant and have antibacterial properties to help maintain good hygiene. Velcro on each end of the mat allows a near seamless connection to additional mats for tumbling runs or expansive areas.\nSizes.\nRanging from 4 feet x 8 feet to 6 feet x 12 feet, sizes usually only matter when limited by space or personal preference. In most cases – like in gymnastics – multiple mats are purchased to be strung together via Velcro to create the ultimate sure-footed tumbling experience. Generally mats used for gymnasiums and gymnastics mats come in 2-foot-wide panels and is why many in the industry call them folding panel mats or folding mats. The 2-foot-wide panels allow for ease in both set up and clean up when using the mats to becoming the perfect compact size for storage.\nIncline mats.\nIncline mats, also known as wedge mats, cheese mats or simply \"the cheese\", are firm mats shaped like right triangles. They are mainly used to teach and train beginning and intermediate gymnastics skills such as rolls, walkovers and handsprings.\nSpringboard mats.\nThese firm mats are used on vault. They are U-shaped and surround the springboard on three sides. In the event that the gymnast's foot misses the springboard during his or her vault attempt, he or she can push off the mat for momentum and, hopefully, avoid a serious injury. Under the current \"Code of Points\", performing a Yurchenko-style vault without the safety mat results in an automatic score of zero.\nLanding mats.\nThese mats are thin and soft, and are usually white or red in color to distinguish them from the other mats and floor exercise area. They are used on the floor exercise to lessen the \"sting,\" or impact, of tumbling run landings and for dismounts on the beam or floor. Sting mats are routinely used in training, but are only rarely used or permitted in competition."

        "title": "Nick Anderson (basketball)",
        "text": "Nelison \"Nick\" Anderson (born January 20, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player who played for the Orlando Magic, Sacramento Kings, and Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA).\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Anderson played high school basketball at Simeon Career Academy where he was named \"Illinois Mr. Basketball\" for 1986 after leading his team to the city championship and a top national ranking in \"USA Today\".\nAnderson would go on to play at the University of Illinois for three years. He was then drafted by the Orlando Magic in the 1989 NBA draft. He currently serves the Magic in several off-the-court functions and was elected to the \"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\" in 2004.\nCollege career.\nAnderson attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign for three years, playing on the team that reached the NCAA Final Four in 1989; that Fighting Illini team was given the nickname \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale. Among Anderson's teammates were Kendall Gill, Stephen Bardo, Kenny Battle, Lowell Hamilton, and Marcus Liberty; all of these except Hamilton would go on to play in the NBA.\nNBA career.\nEarly years.\nAnderson left school and entered the NBA draft in 1989, where he was selected with the 11th pick of the first round by the Orlando Magic. As the Magic were an expansion team that season, Anderson was the first draft pick in the franchise's history.\nLike most expansion franchises, the Magic were a young team and Anderson was one of its few bright spots. As a result, the Magic were awarded high draft picks in several consecutive years, including Dennis Scott in 1990, Shaquille O'Neal in 1992, and Chris Webber, who was traded for a package including Penny Hardaway in 1993. In his first few seasons, Anderson was the Magic's top scoring option, and led the team in points per game during the 1991–92 season. As the team's talent level increased, Anderson was gradually relegated to a lesser offensive role but remained a consistent member of the team's starting lineup. Exceptions include the April 23, 1993 game at New Jersey, in which he scored a career-high 50 points off the bench. In 1994–95, Anderson led Orlando in three-pointers with 179, and averaged 15.9 points per game. The Magic won 57 games, finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference, and won their first ever Atlantic Division title.\n1994–95 postseason.\nIn the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Magic faced the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan, who had recently returned from an aborted baseball career wearing the number 45 instead of his famous number 23. At the end of Game One, Anderson famously stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic. He later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\" and that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to.\" Jordan then returned to wearing his old number in the next game, scoring 38 points in a Bulls win; the Magic would bounce back and win the series to advance to their first NBA Finals.\nGame One of the NBA Finals was against the defending champion Houston Rockets, at the Orlando Arena. With the Magic up by three points late in the game, Anderson, typically a 70% free throw shooter, missed four consecutive free throws that could have sealed the victory for Orlando. Kenny Smith hit a three-pointer for Houston shortly thereafter, tying the game and sending it to overtime. The Rockets went on to win the game in overtime and eventually swept the Magic, winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. As a result of this incident, some Orlando fans began to label Anderson with the derogatory nicknames of \"Nick the Brick\" and \"Brick Anderson\".\nPost-1995 career.\nHe showed no immediate effect from his struggles in the 1995 finals, as he had another strong season in 1995–96. However, his season ended due to a wrist injury in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals. After that, Anderson's career took an abrupt downward spiral, largely due to a sudden inability to shoot free throws. During the 1996–97 season, Anderson's free throw shooting percentage tumbled to a career-low 40.4% and his scoring average to 12.0 points per game. Anderson had to be removed from the closing minutes of several close games due to being an unreliable free throw shooter.\nHis struggles worsened through the first half of the 1997–98 season. Through January 27 of that season, Anderson was averaging only 6.5 points per game, and shooting a paltry 36.3% from the free throw line. However, in the second half of the season, Anderson experienced a sudden career revival, as his scoring average abruptly jumped to 22.6 points per game, and his free throw percentage improved to a 67.6%, a figure close to his former career average. He ended the season with a scoring average of 15.3 points per game.\nAnderson would play on with the Magic through the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, after which he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Tariq Abdul-Wahad and draft compensation. He left Orlando as the team's career scoring leader. He was the last player remaining from the Magic's original expansion roster, having remained with the franchise for ten seasons.\nHe played two seasons in Sacramento, averaging a career-low at that point, 10.8 points per contest in 72 games his first season. He played 21 games the next season, and 15 games in his final season, in which he played for the Memphis Grizzlies.\nAnderson works for the Orlando Magic in the team's community relations department. He also serves as a commentator for Fox Sports Florida during the Magic's pre-game, halftime and post-game shows."

        "title": "Korean Basketball League",
        "text": "The Korean Basketball League () or simply KBL is a professional men's basketball league in South Korea which was established in 1997. The league consists of ten teams and each team plays a total of 54 games (27 home and 27 away) in the regular season.\nHistory.\nThe Korean Basketball League was established in 1997. Prior to the professional era, domestic basketball was an amateur sport and all teams, whether sponsored by a corporate company or a university, participated in the National Basketball Festival (), a competition sanctioned by the Korea Basketball Association. Early teams were sponsored by major corporate companies or universities. The Korea Development Bank (KDB) and Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) established their basketball teams as early as the 1950s and 1960s while Yonsei University and Korea University are considered pioneers of domestic college basketball, having introduced the sport to their institutions before World War II. During the 1970s and 1980s, major industrial companies such as Kia Motors, Hyundai Electronics and Samsung Electronics started their own basketball teams. The predecessor teams of Goyang Orion Orions, Anyang KGC and Wonju DB Promy were founded during the 1990s by smaller-scale companies hoping to take advantage of the \"basketball craze\".\nProfessional era.\nThe 1996–97 National Basketball Festival ended in January 1997, and the inaugural KBL season began one month later in February. The National Basketball Festival remains an amateur-only tournament to this day and is contested by university reserve teams, amateur teams and the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps's basketball team.\nSponsoring companies were given the option to register their basketball teams in the upcoming professional league. KDB and IBK opted to sell their teams; however, their new owners chose to re-start the teams as brand new franchises, only acquiring their players and staff but not inheriting the team's legacy or historical records. The founding teams were Busan Kia Enterprise, Gyeongnam LG Sakers, Daegu Tongyang Orions, Suwon Samsung Thunders, Wonju Naray Blue Bird, Anyang SBS Stars, Incheon Daewoo Zeus, Daejeon Hyundai Dynat, and Gwangju Nasan Flamans. Some of the teams, such as Anyang SBS Stars, had been based in Seoul but chose to move to another city. The plan was to have a team based in each geographical region rather than only centralized in the Seoul Capital Area. The 1997–98 season was the first full season played and the tenth team, Cheongju SK Knights, was added as a member. The KBL has had ten teams ever since.\nThe early years of the league were plagued by the financial instability, exacerbated by the 1997 Asian financial crisis which had impacted South Korea especially hard. As with other domestic sports leagues, the KBL was not immune to the economic fall-out. The KBL had difficulty finding a league sponsor for the 1997–98 season while teams were forced to cut costs. Between 1997 and 2001, five of the ten teams had changed ownership due to financial problems.\nFormat.\nThe KBL follows FIBA rules regarding standards of play and court dimensions.\nFor the regular season, the round-robin format is utilized as each team plays against every other team six times (three home and three away). A total of 54 games are played in six rounds. Only the top six teams in the regular season standings advance to the post-season playoffs.\nLeague structure.\nKBL Cup.\nThe KBL Cup was first introduced in 2020 as a pre-season competition for all teams to test out their strengths before the commencement of the regular season.\nIt is generally held in September. Aside from the participation of all 10 teams of the KBL league, Sangmu Basketball Team also participates in the KBL Cup, making it a total of 11 teams.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season runs from October to early April. Each team plays against the other nine teams six times (3 home and 3 away). A total of 54 games are played in six rounds.\nThe annual KBL Award Ceremony takes place right after the end of the regular season.\nTeams which failed to qualify for the post-season playoffs take a short break before commencing their off-season training to prepare them for the upcoming season.\nPost-season playoffs.\nThe playoffs usually begin a week after the end of the regular season.\nOnly the top six teams in the regular season standings advance to the post-season playoffs.\nThe qualification of the six teams for either the quarter-finals or semi-finals of the playoffs are determined by their regular season standings. The teams ranked from third to sixth qualify for the quarter-finals, and the teams ranked first and second earn an automatic advancement to the semi-finals.\nThe quarter-finals are played in a best-of-three format. The two winning teams of the quarter-finals then advance to the semi-finals.\nThe semi-finals are played in a best-of-five format. The two winning teams of the semi-finals then compete for the KBL championship title in the finals.\nThe finals are played in a best-of-seven format.\nKBL All-Star Game.\nThe KBL All-Star Game is held in mid-January every year. The event is usually held in Seoul, except for multiple occasions where it was held outside of Seoul (2007 in Ulsan, 2017 in Busan, and 2021 in Daegu).\nBased on the 2021–22 All-Star Game format, five players from each of the ten teams are nominated for the All-Star fan vote. Only the top 24 players in the fan vote standings are selected to participate in the All-Star Game. The two players with the most number of votes form their respective teams by recruiting eleven players each, regardless of their original teams.\nIndividual achievements.\nAwards.\nThe KBL awards ceremony is held annually at the end of the regular season. As of the 2020–21 season, the following honours are awarded:\nThe awards ceremony takes place at the conclusion of the regular season, before the playoffs begin. The Playoffs MVP is only awarded at the conclusion of the final Championship game.\nDraft.\nDomestic players.\nDomestic players, defined as possessing South Korean citizenship according to FIBA laws, are recruited through an annual rookie draft. The draft was held since 1998. In 2009, an ethnic draft was introduced to allow the recruitment of players who have acquired South Korean nationality, or either of their parents is a Korean. Players recruited through ethnic drafts are waived from being counted as an import player. However, due to the controversial nature of the recruitment rules and the backlash, the ethnic draft was eventually abolished in 2013.\nImport players.\nFrom 2018, all teams are allowed to freely select their import players, subject to a \"two-import\" quota per team and a salary cap of $700,000. Only one foreign player is allowed to play on court in every quarter.\nAsian player quota.\nIn a move to further develop the quality of basketball in the country, the \"Asian Player Quota\" programme was introduced ahead of the 2020–21 season for Japanese players. This programme allows each team to recruit one Japanese player (excluding naturalized, dual citizenship and mixed race players) from Japan's B.League. Players recruited under the \"Asian Player Quota\" programme are excluded from the foreign player quota, and included in the domestic player salary cap. Wonju DB Promy became the first team in the league to recruit a Japanese player, as they inked a one-year deal with Taichi Nakamura. Ahead of the 2022–23 season, the programme was extended to Filipino players (owns a Philippine passport and both parents must have either Philippine citizenship or passport). In June 2022, Daegu KOGAS Pegasus becomes the first team to recruit a Filipino player, as they announced a two-year deal with SJ Belangel.\nMandatory military service.\nPlayers of the Korean Basketball League are eligible to apply to fulfil their military service obligations as members of the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps. Alongside military duties, they are allowed to train as professional athletes and play for the Sangmu Basketball Team. Successful applicants officially enlists in May or June and are discharged eighteen months later in January, returning to the team rosters for the final rounds of the regular season."

        "title": "Elf Bowling",
        "text": "Elf Bowling is a bowling video game developed by NStorm and released in 1998 for Windows Computers. In the game \nthe player, as Santa Claus, attempts to knock down elves who are arranged like bowling pins. A later release of the game, by Ignition Entertainment, was released on the Nintendo handheld consoles Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance, and received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics. In \"Elf Bowling\", the elves of Santa's Workshop are on strike due to overwork from the huge demand for Christmas toys, so Santa Claus has decided to whip them into shape by using them as bowling pins.\nDuring the game, the elves say phrases such as \"Is that all the balls you got, Santa?\" when the player misses their first spare opportunity or \"Gutter ball!\" in a silly-sounding voice when a ball is rolled into the gutter. Other potential distractions for the user are a Reindeer that walks up along the bowling lane that can be \"hit\" with the bowling ball if the arrow is positioned to the far left, and a frog wearing a Santa hat hopping back and forth across the player's field of vision (resembling Kalvin Kroaker from \"Frogapult\", also made by NStorm). If the player hits the frog with the bowling ball, its body is hauled away from the screen by a bird from \"Frogapult\". A white rabbit also jumps and defecates across the bowling lane. Unlike the reindeer and the frog, it is not possible to hit the rabbit. The elves moon Santa (asking \"who's your daddy\" as they do it). Both during the game and after a game finishes, the elves do a dance, shouting \"Elf elf, baby!\" in reference to Vanilla Ice's song \"Ice Ice Baby\". The elves can also randomly move out of the way of the ball, and one elf can be decapitated by the pinsetter.\nHistory.\nThe game was originally created as promotional marketing content by Dan Ferguson and Mike Bielinski, both co-founders of the game studio NVision Design . The game became an internet sensation in 1999 when people originally thought it was a computer virus. The game was an EXE file and was easily distributed as an attachment to emails. (In 1999, EXE files could be attached to emails as there was no protective software to remove an EXE at the time.) Direct Marketing News did an article on the original developers - Direct Marketing News Article. According to Media Metrix, among the 54 million people playing PC games in the month of December 2000, \"Elf Bowling\" was the game to hit the top 10 with 7.6 million players that was not bundled with Windows. Local Fox News Affiliate KDFW Dallas Fort Worth did an interview with Dan Ferguson and Mike Bileinski after they sold their company to Vectrix Business Solutions. Vectrix Business Solutions acquired Nvision 1999 and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \"Elf Bowling\" and \"Frogapult\" were sold by Vectrix Business Solutions with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court on October 31, 2001, to Commotion Interactive, Inc. (\"Elf Bowling 3\" was recently released by the Dallas firm NStorm, a subsidiary of Commotion Interactive). Matthew Lichtenwalter, CEO of NStorm and Commotion Interactive, has created the series since.\nSequel.\nIn the sequel to \"Elf Bowling\", the elves return, as they attempt to go on an island vacation with old Kringle. \nDingle Kringle (a failure as a used ice salesman) is Santa's elder brother, whom Mrs. Claus takes a shine to. The brothers make a double-or-nothing wager in a game of shuffleboard, of which on random occasions, a Moai can fall on an elf. The winner gets the title of \"Father Christmas\" while the loser loses his job. The elves are used as pucks.\nGameplay and scoring.\nThe player grabs the thong bathing suit that the elf is wearing, then snaps it to propel the elf forward. There are 100, 200, and 300 point scoring zones and a player can score 400 points if their elf slides all the way to the edge of the board without falling into the ocean; elves falling into the ocean get eaten by sharks or crushed by a falling Moai. There is also the possibility of an elf not advancing far enough to score, which happens if a player does not get enough power behind the snap. Only elves that are on the board after Santa and Dingle have taken their turns count towards the score, and it is possible for an elf to be knocked off the board by another elf (although it is also possible for the elves to be moved into higher scoring zones after contact). One elf per round is worth bonus points, indicated by a flashing bathing suit. In the first and second rounds, the bonus elf is worth double the throw, and in the third, he is worth triple the throw (meaning that the maximum number of points in these rounds that can be earned on one turn is 800 or 1200). The elf only appears once per round and appears randomly.\nBonus points can be gained by shooting the penguins and their balloons on an iceberg located to the right of the ship. The iceberg can also be shot, but doing so (in the right spot) will sink it and take it out of play.\nOther \"Elf Bowling\" games.\nTo date, there have been eight editions of the game for Microsoft Windows.\n\"Elf Bowling 1 &amp; 2\".\nThe first two \"Elf Bowling\" games were released by Ignition Entertainment under the title \"Elf Bowling 1 &amp; 2\" for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance. The pack was panned by critics, citing poor graphics, crude audio and controls, and no extras beyond the original freeware version. It ranks as one of the lowest scoring games at both GameSpot and Metacritic, receiving only 1.4 out of 10 at GameSpot and 12 out of 100 at Metacritic.\nFilm adaptation.\nA computer-animated film produced by based on the games was released on October 3, 2007, and was entitled \"\". It features the voices of the late Joe Alaskey, Rex Piano, Jill Talley, and Tom Kenny. \nThe film was a United States-Fiji-South Korea co-production directed by Dave Kim with Rex Piano as co-director. The musical score for the film was composed by Chris Anderson. Simi Valley, California resident David Kim was asked to direct the film while studying editing at the Academy of Art University; Kim took the offer as a way to break into the film industry, previously working as a production assistant on music videos. After finishing \"Elf Bowling\", he got work as a production coordinator on \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007) and \"The Golden Compass\" (2007). Produced by Filmbrokers International, \"Elf Bowling the Movie\" began production in Fiji and South Korea before moving into a Simi Valley house owned by Kim's mother, where the film's story reel was edited. Dance movements for the musical sequences were animated with motion capture, Kim himself wearing one of the Mo-cap suits. Screen Media Films, a company of Universal Studios Home Entertainment, distributed \"Elf Bowling the Movie\". \nThe film was released on DVD on October 2, 2007 before being released on Amazon Prime on January 1, 2008 and Blu-ray on May 18, 2016. \nThe film was panned by critics for its writing, animation, directing, humor, plot, musical numbers, voice acting, characterizations, and for having little to nothing to do with the premise of the game. Due to the film's disastrous critical reception, plans for a sequel titled \"Elf Bowling 2: The Great Halloween Pumpkin-Heist\" were immediately cancelled. \nThe film received a parody stage adaptation in 2021 by Chapman University's sketch comedy group The Player's Society, adapted by Sasha Espinosa and directed by Delaney Tobin."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball progressive career hits leaders",
        "text": "This list displays a chronology of the annual top ten leaders in career base hits in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1876 through 2022.\nThe table assists in identifying the most significant players in each era, and helps to understand the importance of many past stars. Before Pete Rose broke Ty Cobb's record for career hits, for example, Tris Speaker, Stan Musial, and Hank Aaron had each reached the number two spot in succession. \nIt is also quite valuable to identify the leaders during the 19th century, when seasons were shorter (usually from 60 to 130 games); while nearly 250 players have now reached the 2,000-hit plateau, barely a dozen had done so by the end of the 19th century. \nIn the era before 1893, when the distance between the pitcher and home plate was extended from 45 feet to 60 feet, long-neglected stars Deacon White and Paul Hines were mainstays among the top five, along with Cap Anson and Jim O'Rourke.\nThis chart uses the hit totals that Major League Baseball officially recognizes, as maintained and provided by the Elias Sports Bureau; they are derived from the annual official league statistics, even when those totals have been proven by later research to be in error. Particularly with regard to players from before 1920, these totals often differ from those used by ESPN, CNN/\"Sports Illustrated\", \"The Sporting News\", the Baseball-Reference website, or by MLB's two longtime official encyclopedias, \"The Baseball Encyclopedia\" and \"Total Baseball\". They are also not the same as the historical totals displayed on MLB's official website. \nWhile the specific totals may vary between sources, and slight variations in the order may result, the leaders would overwhelmingly be the same regardless of which set of numbers is used; except for 1904, in no year does more than one player drop out of the top 10 when a different version of the statistics is employed. Furthermore, this table accurately represents what observers of each era \"believed\" to be true.\n2021–.\nActive players are marked in bold italics."

        "title": "Thomas Jones (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas Quinn Jones (born August 19, 1978) is an American actor and a former football player. He was a running back who played 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers, earning consensus All-American honors in 1999. Jones was selected by the Arizona Cardinals seventh overall in the 2000 NFL Draft, and played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in addition to the New York Jets, Chicago Bears and Kansas City Chiefs. He retired among the top 25 leading rushers in NFL history (currently 26th, after LeSean McCoy passed him), and a member of the 10,000 rushing yards club. In September 2019 he was nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2020.\nIn 2013, performing under the name Thomas Q. Jones due to the SAG-AFTRA's unique stage name requirements, he began an acting career. Among his credits are 2015's \"Straight Outta Compton\" and a recurring role in the \"Luke Cage\" series.\nEarly years.\nThomas was born in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. His mother, Betty, worked the graveyard shift in a Virginia coal mine for nearly 20 years while raising seven children, including his younger brother, Julius Jones. While in Appalachia, Virginia, his father encouraged the children to learn five new words per day, and made them read the front page of the newspaper, before they could read the sports section. Jones credits his parents with instilling the ambition and strong work ethic that he is known for in professional football.\nWhile playing for Powell Valley High School in Big Stone Gap, he led the team to back-to-back state championships in 1994 and 1995. He still holds the VHSL record for the most rushing yards in a season with 3,319. He broke his late uncle's (Edd Clark) single-game rushing record in 1994 (462 yards against John I. Burton High School). He also tied for most career touchdowns (104) with Terry Kirby. Thomas was featured in the January 22 (1996) issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" section, \"Faces in the Crowd\".\nCollege football career.\nJones attended the University of Virginia, and played for coach George Welsh's Virginia Cavaliers football team from 1996 to 1999. Through four years, he left his mark on the record books of both the team and the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He ended his career at Virginia with eight conference and fifteen team records, including finishing as the Cavaliers' all-time rushing leader with 3,998 yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 3,389 yards set by Tiki Barber. His rushing total was the fourth highest in conference history. Jones also set the conference and school record for single season rushing (1,798 yards) and single season all-purpose offense (2,054 yards). While becoming the first player in ACC history to attain 200 yards rushing and 100 yards receiving in a single game, Jones set a single game school record with 331 all-purpose yards against the University at Buffalo. Setting an ACC record for 200-yard games, Jones finished with six 200-yard rushing performances. He finished his college career with 4,698 all-purpose yards, fourth all-time at Virginia.\nAs a senior in 1999, Jones was voted as a consensus first-team All-American by The Associated Press, Football News, the Football Writers Association of America, Walter Camp Foundation, and The Sporting News. Finishing 8th in balloting for the 1999 Heisman Trophy, he was the first ACC consensus All-American running back since 1978 (Ted Brown, NC State) and third in league history. Jones led the conference running backs and receiving yards, amassed four 200-yard games, and finished third in the nation in rushing (163.5 yards/game) and all-purpose yards (186.7 yards/game).\nWhile successful on the field, Jones also focused in the classroom, earning his bachelor's degree in psychology in three years.\nProfessional football career.\nArizona Cardinals.\nThomas Jones was chosen by the Arizona Cardinals in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft with the seventh overall selection. In his three years with Arizona he rushed for 1,264 yards and 9 touchdowns. He was injury-prone, however, and finished only one full season (2001) for the Cardinals. Up until the 2002 season he also was splitting time with running back Michael Pittman. Jones was traded in 2003 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThough not the featured back in Tampa Bay, Jones played an injury-free season, gained 627 yards, and scored three rushing touchdowns while averaging 4.6 yards per carry.\nChicago Bears.\nAs a free agent in 2004, Jones received his opportunity to be a featured back, signing a multi-year contract with Chicago. In his first season with Chicago, he rushed for 948 yards and 7 touchdowns. After the season, Ron Turner took over as offensive coordinator and installed zone blocking schemes that utilized Jones's speed and ability to make quick decisions. Heading into the 2005 NFL season, Jones figured to return to sharing duty as the Bears used their top draft pick on running back Cedric Benson. However, a lengthy hold-out prevented Benson from pushing Jones for playing time. After starting the season with a poor performance against the Washington Redskins defense, Jones proceeded to recover with season statistics of 1,335 yards and 9 touchdowns. Jones amassed 61 first downs while averaging 4.3 yards per carry. A veteran with, at that time, six years league experience, Jones continued to see extended playing time to assist the offensive line with pass blocking for Rex Grossman. After the 2005 season, Jones fired his agent and hired Drew Rosenhaus in April 2006.\nJones did not participate in the Bears’ voluntary off season program in 2006, opting instead to work out on his own, leading to Benson lining up with the first team during workouts. On July 26, Jones injured his hamstring during a physical at the Bears' summer camp; Lovie Smith announced Jones would fall behind Cedric Benson on the depth chart. However, on August 4, Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine practice drill, and Jones returned to his featured back position.\nThe Bears’ two-headed rushing attack showcased both players during the 2006 season. Benson, at 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, acted as a straight-ahead runner, whereas Jones used his quicker 5-foot-10 and 215-pound frame to find holes in Chicago's zone-blocking scheme to get through the defense. During the regular season, Jones gained 1,210 yards and Benson amassed 647 yards; both averaged over four yards per carry. Jones had four 100-yard performances during the regular season and continued to see an increased role in the passing game as Benson had not yet mastered pass protection. That year, Thomas and his brother Julius became the first brother tandem in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards in the same season.\nDuring the 2006 playoffs, Jones rushed for 66 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries en route to a 27–24 Bears’ victory over the Seattle Seahawks. The next week he rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries in the NFC championship game against the New Orleans Saints, helping the Bears advance to the Super Bowl with a 39–14 win. Jones's 123 rushing yards against the Saints set a Bears postseason record. On a crucial drive late in the first half, after three stalled Bears drives ended in field goals, Jones ran the ball on every play of an eight-play, 69-yard drive and scored the Bears' first touchdown of the game.\nJones was one of three college teammates who reunited in Super Bowl XLI. Jones, his teammate John St. Clair, and Terrence Wilkins of the Indianapolis Colts were roommates at the University of Virginia. In Super Bowl XLI, Jones finished with 112 yards rushing and 18 yards receiving, including a 52-yard run that marked Chicago's longest run of the season. Though averaging 7.5 yards per carry in the game, the Bears only called 15 running plays in the 29–17 loss to Indianapolis.\nNew York Jets.\nOn March 5, 2007, the Bears traded Jones and their second-round pick (63rd overall) in the 2007 NFL Draft to the New York Jets in exchange for their second-round pick (from the Washington Redskins) (37th overall). Following the completion of the trade, the Jets signed Jones to a four-year, $25 million extension.\nIn the 2007 season, Jones carried the ball 310 times for 1,119 yards, his third straight one-thousand yard season. Of note, Jones scored the first receiving touchdown of his career as well. However, he averaged a subpar 3.6 yards a carry, and scored only one rushing TD, as the Jets stumbled to a 4–12 finish.\nJones had his best season in 2008. Named the AFC's starting running back in the Pro Bowl, Jones scored 15 total touchdowns, including two via receptions, and rushed for 1,312 yards to lead the AFC.\nOn October 18, 2009, in a game against the Buffalo Bills, Jones rushed for a Jets franchise record 210 yards and a touchdown, breaking the old mark set by Curtis Martin. However, the Jets lost 16–13 in overtime. On December 3, 2009, Jones reached 1,068 rushing yards for the 2009 season against the Buffalo Bills. This would mark the fifth consecutive season in which Jones has rushed for 1,000+ yards.\nOn January 17, 2010, Jones converted a final minute 4th and 1 to lead the Jets to victory over the San Diego Chargers in a 2009 playoff game. The win ensured that the Jets would play the Indianapolis Colts in the 2009 AFC championship game.\nOn March 1, 2010, the New York Jets announced that they would release Jones as of March 5, 2010, due to an upcoming contract bonus (all despite having a career-high season with 1,402 rushing yards) and talks with LaDainian Tomlinson. He was officially released on March 5.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nJones signed a two-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs on March 9, 2010.\nIn week 15 against the St. Louis Rams, Jones ran for 62 yards on 22 carries with one touchdown. In this game he achieved the 10,000-yard rushing mark. He was only the 25th player in NFL history to do so at the time.\nPost-football career.\nJones has said that he has decided to donate his brain to the Sports Legacy Institute, which studies the link between sports and brain trauma, for research upon his death. In January 2017, Jones stated that if he had to do it over, he would not play football due to the physical consequences.\nJones is founder and CEO of technology company Castar Applications Inc.\nActing career.\nJones has since become a film and television actor, performing under the name Thomas Q. Jones.\nJones is the owner of the production company Independently Major Entertainment Films (IME Films), which produced \"A Violent Man\" (2019) for Sony Pictures, in which he starred and directed by Matthew Berkowitz. He headlined the independent film \"Runaway Island\" (2015) alongside Lorraine Toussaint and Aisha Hinds. He appeared in \"Straight Outta Compton\" the 2015 feature film based on the lives and careers of hip-hop group N.W.A.\nIn 2016, Jones produced and acted in a screen adaptation of the graphic novel \"Loyalty,\" with Lucien Laviscount, and acted in the independent short film project, \"Love and the Line,\" and the independent feature film \"9 Rides,\" shot entirely using 4K video with an iPhone 6s.\nIn television, Jones is best known for his Marvel character \"Comanche\" on the Netflix series \"Luke Cage\". He guest starred in the BET Network series \"Tales\" and in Seasons 2 and 3 of the BET hit drama series \"Being Mary Jane\", in a multi-episode arc as \"Brandon 'Cutty Buddy' Gibson,\" love interest to Gabrielle Union's title character. On the TV ONE comedy series \"Born Again Virgin\", Jones guest-starred as commercial pilot Vince, a love interest of the series lead played by Danielle Nicolet. He also appeared in featured roles in the Showtime series \"Shameless\" and IFC's \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\". Jones will be in a recurring role on the Starz series \"P-Valley\" (2020)."

        "title": "Rules of basketball",
        "text": "The rules of basketball are the rules and regulations that govern the play, officiating, equipment and procedures of basketball. While many of the basic rules are uniform throughout the world, variations do exist. Most leagues or governing bodies in North America, the most important of which are the National Basketball Association and NCAA, formulate their own rules. In addition, the Technical Commission of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) determines rules for international play; most leagues outside North America use the complete FIBA ruleset.\nOriginal rules.\nOn 15 January 1892, James Naismith published his rules for the game of \"Basket Ball\" that he invented: The original game played under these rules was quite different from the one played today as there was no dribbling, dunking, three-pointers, or shot clock, and goal tending was legal.\nNaismith's original 1892 manuscript of the rules of basketball, one of the most expensive manuscripts in existence, is publicly displayed at Allen Fieldhouse on the campus of the University of Kansas. Naismith was the first coach in the history of Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball.\nPlayers, substitutes, teams and teammates.\nNaismith's original rules did not specify how many players were to be on the court. In 1900, five players became standard, and players that were substituted were not allowed to re-enter the game. Players were allowed to re-enter a game once from 1921, and twice from 1934; such restrictions on substitutions were abolished in 1945 when substitutions became unlimited. Coaching was originally prohibited during the game, but from 1949, coaches were allowed to address players during a time-out.\nOriginally a player was disqualified on his second foul. This limit became four fouls in 1911 and five fouls in 1945, still the case in most forms of basketball where the normal length of the game (before any overtime periods) is 40 minutes. When the normal length is 48 minutes (this is the case with the National Basketball Association in the United States and Canada) a player is accordingly disqualified on his sixth foul.\nShot clock and time limits.\nThe first time restriction on possession of the ball was introduced in 1933, where teams were required to advance the ball over the center line within ten seconds of gaining possession. This rule remained until 2000, when FIBA reduced the requirement to eight seconds, the NBA following suit in 2001. The NCAA retains the 10-second rule for men's play, and adopted this rule for women's play starting with the 2013–14 season. U.S. high schools, whose rules are drafted by NFHS, also use the 10-second rule for both sexes.\nWhile a team is inbounding the basketball, they have 5 seconds to do so. This rule is in tact no matter where a team is inbounding the ball, whether it is under the net or from the sidelines. If they fail to release the basketball after 5 seconds, it will be counted as a turnover and possession will go to the other team.\nIn 1936 the three-second rule was introduced. This rule prohibits offensive players from remaining near their opponents' basket for longer than three seconds (the precise \"restricted area\" is also known as the \"lane\" or the \"key\"). A game central to this rule's introduction was that between the University of Kentucky and New York University. Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp did not take one of his referees with him, despite being warned of discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and East by Notre Dame coach George Keogan, and the game became especially rough. Because of this game and others, Kentucky All-American center Leroy Edwards is generally recognized as the player responsible for the three-second rule.\nWhile the rule was originally adopted to reduce roughness in the area between big men, it is now considered to prevent tall offensive players from gaining an advantage by waiting close to the basket. When the NBA started to allow zone defense in 2001, a three-second rule for defensive players was also introduced.\nThe shot clock was first introduced by the NBA in 1954, to increase the speed of play. Teams were then required to attempt a shot within 24 seconds of gaining possession, and the shot clock would be reset when the ball touched the basket's rim or the backboard, or the opponents gained possession. FIBA adopted a 30-second shot clock two years later, resetting the clock when a shot was attempted. Women's basketball adopted a 30-second clock in 1971. The NCAA adopted a 45-second shot clock for men while continuing with the 30-second clock for women in 1985. The men's shot clock was then reduced to 35 seconds in 1993, and further reduced to 30 seconds in 2015. FIBA reduced the shot clock to 24 seconds in 2000, and changed the clock's resetting to when the ball touched the rim of the basket. Originally, a missed shot where the shot clock expired while the ball is in the air constituted a violation. In 2003 the rule was changed so that the ball remains live in this situation, as long as it touched the rim. If the ball touches the rim and slightly bounces over the basketball hoop it will be called as a loose ball.\nFouls, free throws and violations.\nDribbling was not part of the original game, but was introduced in 1901. At the time, a player could only bounce the ball once, and could not shoot after he had dribbled. The definition of dribbling became the \"continuous passage of the ball\" in 1909, allowing more than one bounce, and a player who had dribbled was then allowed to shoot.\nRunning with the ball ceased to be considered a foul in 1922, and became a violation, meaning that the only penalty was loss of possession. Striking the ball with the fist has also become a violation. From 1931, if a closely guarded player withheld the ball from play for five seconds, play was stopped and resumed with a jump ball; such a situation has since become a violation by the ball-carrier. Goaltending became a violation in 1944, and offensive goaltending in 1958.\nFree throws were introduced shortly after basketball was invented. In 1895, the free throw line was officially placed from the backboard, prior to which most gymnasiums placed one from the backboard. From 1924, players that received a foul were required to shoot their own free throws. One free throw shot is awarded to a player who was fouled while making a successful field goal attempt. If the field goal attempt is unsuccessful, two free throw shots are awarded (three if the player was attempting a three-point field goal). If an offensive player is fouled while not in the act of shooting, or if a player is fouled in a loose-ball situation, the penalty varies by level of play and the number of fouls accumulated by the opposing team in a given period.\nA player has 10 seconds to attempt a free throw. If the player does not attempt a free throw within 10 seconds of receiving the ball, the free throw attempt is lost, and a free throw violation is called. A free throw violation also occurs if a free throw misses the backboard, rim, and basket. If a free throw violation is assessed on the last free throw awarded to a player in a given situation, possession automatically reverts to the opposing team.\nA charge is physical contact between an offensive player and a defensive player. In order to draw an offensive charge the defensive player must establish legal guarding positioning in the path of the offensive player. If contact is made, the officials would issue an offensive charge. No points will be allowed and the ball is turned over. The defensive player may not draw an offensive charge in the \"restricted zone\" (see below for more details).\nBlocking is physical contact between the offensive player and the defensive player. Blocking fouls are issued when a defensive player interferes with the path of the offensive player in the shooting motion. Blocking fouls are easily called when the defensive player is standing in the \"restricted zone\".\nRestricted zone: In 1997, the NBA introduced an arc of a radius around the basket, in which an offensive foul for charging could not be assessed. This was to prevent defensive players from attempting to draw an offensive foul on their opponents by standing underneath the basket. FIBA adopted this arc with a radius in 2010.\nIf a foul by a player is interpreted as excessive, or unnecessary, a flagrant 1 foul will be assessed. The opposing team will then be rewarded with 2 free throws and possession of the ball. If a foul by a player is interpreted as excessive, or unnecessary, and excessive, a flagrant 2 foul will be assessed. The opposing team will then be rewarded with 2 free throws and possession of the ball. With a flagrant 2 foul, the player that committed the foul will not only be automatically ejected, but fined at least $2,000 as well\nA technical foul can given to a team in many different ways. A technical foul can be given when a team calls more time outs than they have, delaying the game, have too many players on the court, verbally disrespect or curse, or hang on the rim. With a technical foul, the opposing team will be rewarded with a free throw, and possession of the ball as well. If a player, or coach gets 2 technical fouls in one game, it will result in an automatic ejection. \nEquipment.\nInitially, basketball was played with an \"ordinary association football (soccer ball), although the sport now uses its own ball. The goal is placed above the court. Originally a basket was used (thus \"basket-ball\"), so the ball had to be retrieved after each made shot. Today a hoop with an open-bottom hanging net is used instead.\nIn the Men's leagues, such as the NBA, mens college basketball, and high school, they use a size seven basketball. This is a ball with a 29.5 inch circumference weighing 22 oz. \nIn the Women's basketball leagues, such as the WNBA, women's college basketball, and high school, they use a size 6 ball. This ball is slightly smaller than the size 7 ball, having a 28.5 inch circumference, and weighing 20 oz. \nOfficiating and procedures.\nOriginally, there was one umpire to judge fouls and one referee to judge the ball; the tradition of calling one official the \"referee\" and the other one or two the \"umpires\" has remained (the NBA, however, uses different terminology, referring to the lead official as \"crew chief\" and the others as \"referees\"). Today, both classes of officials have equal rights to control all aspects of the game. The NBA added a third official in 1988, and FIBA did so afterward, using it for the first time in international competition in 2006. The use of video evidence to inform referee's decisions has always been banned, except in the case of determining whether or not the last shot of a period was attempted before time expired. This exception was introduced by the NBA in 2002 and adopted by FIBA in 2006. The NCAA, however, has permitted instant replay for timing, the value of a field goal (two or three points), shot clock violations, and for purposes of disqualifying players because of unsportsmanlike conduct. The NBA changed its rules starting in 2007 to allow officials the ability to view instant replay with plays involving flagrant fouls, similar to the NCAA. In Italy's Serie A, an American football-style coach's challenge is permitted to challenge (at the next dead ball) an official's call on any situation similar to the NCAA.\nThe center jump ball that was used to restart a game after every successful field goal was eliminated in 1938, in favor of the ball being given to the non-scoring team from behind the end line where the goal was scored, in order to make play more continuous. The jump ball was still used to start the game and every period, and to restart the game after a held ball. However, the NBA stopped using the jump ball to start the second through fourth quarters in 1975, instead using a quarter-possession system where the loser of the jump ball takes the ball from the other end to start the second and third periods, while the winner of that jump ball takes the ball to start the fourth period from the other end of the court.\nIn 1976, the NBA introduced a rule to allow teams to advance the ball to the center line following any legal time-out in the final two minutes of the game. FIBA followed suit in 2006.\nIn 1981, the NCAA adopted the alternating possession system for all jump ball situations except the beginning of the game, and in 2003, FIBA adopted a similar rule, except for the start of the third period and overtime. In 2004, the rule was changed in FIBA that the arrow applies for all situations after the opening tap.\nInternational rules of basketball.\nThe most recent international rules of basketball were approved 2 February 2014 by FIBA and became effective 1 October of that year.\nThere are eight rules encompassing 50 articles, covering equipment and facilities, regulations regarding teams, players, captains and coaches, playing regulations, violations, fouls and their penalties, special situations, and the officials and table officials. The rules also cover officials' signals, the scoresheet, protest procedure, classification of teams and television timeouts."

The skateboarder holds the tail of the skateboard deck with the back hand, while the back foot is taken off the skateboard and extended downwards. The front foot is straightened but kept on the board. When the front foot is extended, the tail of the board is brought close to the inner thigh of the front leg.\nThe trick's inventor, Lester Kasai, considers a \"true benihana\" to be one done when the skateboarder performs the motion as described above after riding up backwards (or fakie) on a transition and landing back into the transition facing forwards, and calls the trick with the motion performed while moving forwards a \"benibonga\".\nPopularity.\nThe trick was very popular in the 1990s, with professional skateboarders like Jamie Thomas and Josh Kasper recognised for their proficiency with regard to the benihana. However, since that point, the popularity of the trick has waned.\nThe trick featured in the Tony Hawk video game series including \"Tony Hawk's Underground 2\", released in 2004.\nIn 2008, \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine ran a feature that included the benihana in a list of the \"10 Worst Tricks In Skateboarding\" and described the trick as \"terrible\"."

The station is located on Arthur Road close to the junction with Melrose Avenue close to the eastern side of Wimbledon Park. It is about west of Durnsford Road (A218) and is in Travelcard Zone 3.\nHistory.\nThe station was opened by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on 3 June 1889 on an extension from to . The extension was built by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) which, starting on 1 July 1889, ran its own trains over the line from a connection at East Putney to its to line.\nThe section of the District line from Putney Bridge to Wimbledon was the last part of the line to be converted from steam operation to electric. Electric trains began running on 27 August 1905.\nMain line services through Wimbledon Park ended on 4 May 1941. By then, the station was on a line of the Southern Railway (successor to the L&amp;SWR), although the line remained in British Rail ownership until 1 April 1994 when it was transferred to London Underground. Until the transfer, the station was branded as a British Rail station. The route from Wimbledon to Wandsworth Town (Point Pleasant Junction) is still used by South Western Railway for empty stock movements and occasional service train diversions, as well as three daily South Western Railway services which run to and from Waterloo via the route in the early hours of the morning; so South Western Railway trains pass through Wimbledon Park station on a daily basis, but without stopping. There are very infrequent movements of Network Rail engineering trains and light engine movements through the station as well.\nOn 18 June 2012, Surrey cricketer Tom Maynard was electrocuted and hit by a London Underground train while trying to escape from police near Wimbledon Park station.\nIn 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a £200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube. Step-free access was achieved in September 2021.\nPast plans.\nWimbledon Park was a proposed stop on the Chelsea-Hackney Line, now known as Crossrail 2. It was envisioned that the station's District line services would have been replaced by the new line."

Originally, the champion had the right to accept or reject a challenge, usually depending upon the prize money put up by the challenger's sponsor: several years could thus go by between challenge matches. \nThe top four ranked players in the world (excluding the champion himself) playoff for the right to challenge, with the champion and challenger playing a match of up to 13 sets over three days (4 sets, 4 sets and up to 5 sets on the final day). In theory, this is the only match the champion has to play in the two years since winning the last one.\nThe most recent men's world championship match was held in 2023, with sets being played on the 17th, 19th, and 21st of September in suburban Washington, D.C.\nMen's doubles.\nThe men's doubles title is earned in a tournament with the sport's eight top-ranked pairings. Competed every odd-numbered year, it is hosted in rotation among the countries with active courts in the following order: the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and the United States.

Since 2011, the title has been held by Claire Fahey (née Vigrass).\nWomen's doubles.\nThe women's doubles world championship is held at the same time and venue as the women's singles championship.

        "text": "Samuel Jones (June 24, 1933 – December 30, 2021) was an American professional basketball player who was a shooting guard for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A five-time NBA All-Star, he was known for his quickness and game-winning shots, especially during the NBA playoffs. Jones has the second most NBA championships of any player (10), behind only his teammate Bill Russell (11). He was also one of only three Celtics (along with teammates Russell and K. C. Jones) to be part of each of the Celtics' eight consecutive championships from 1959 to 1966. Jones is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nJones was born in Laurinburg, North Carolina, on June 24, 1933. He attended Laurinburg Institute.\nCollege career.\nHe studied and played college basketball at North Carolina Central University (then North Carolina College). There, he was a four-year letterwinner for Hall of Fame coach John McLendon and coach Floyd Brown. Jones scored 1,745 points and was a three-time All-CIAA league selection. His number 41 was later retired by the Eagles. He also served in the United States Army for two years. He was intending to become a teacher after graduating.\nJones was originally drafted by the Minneapolis Lakers as the eighth pick of the 1956 NBA draft. However, he opted to return to college to earn his degree upon completion of military service, and therefore voided the Lakers' rights to him under NBA rules.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (1957–1969).\nBoston Celtics Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach subsequently took a trip south to scout North Carolina players who had just won the national championship. Former Wake Forest coach Bones McKinney told Auerbach he could visit Chapel Hill, but the best player in the state was a few miles away. Eventually, the Philadelphia Warriors selected North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth with the sixth pick of the 1957 NBA draft. Boston selected Jones two picks later, even though Auerbach had never seen Jones play.\nJones made his NBA debut on October 22, 1957, recording one rebound in three minutes played against the St. Louis Hawks. He was a reserve for a number of seasons before replacing Bill Sharman as a starter.\nJones was one of only six Boston Celtics to have ever scored 50 points in an NBA game. At the time of his death in 2021, he owned Boston's sixth-best single-game scoring output (51 points vs. Detroit Pistons on October 29, 1965). He also recorded 22 points and 5 rebounds in Game 7 of the 1966 NBA Finals as the Celtics won their eighth straight NBA Finals. Jones ultimately played twelve seasons in the NBA with the Celtics, scoring 15,411 points to go along with 2,209 assists and 4,305 rebounds. He was the franchise's career scoring leader at the time of his retirement in 1969.\nCoaching career.\nAfter retiring from basketball, Jones coached at Federal City College (now known as University of the District of Columbia) from 1969 to 1973 and at North Carolina Central University, his alma mater, in 1973–74. He was an assistant coach for the New Orleans Jazz in 1974–75.\nPlayer profile.\nJones was known as a clutch scorer. He participated in five All-Star Games, and is usually recognized as having been one of the best shooting guards of his generation. Jones was named to the All-NBA Second Team three straight years (1965–67) and he played on 10 championship teams (1959–66 and 1968–69) — a total exceeded only by teammate Bill Russell in NBA history.\nJones' perfect form when shooting a jump shot, along with his great clutch shooting, led opponents to nickname him \"The Shooter.\" He was particularly adept at shooting the bank shot, in which the shooter bounces the ball off the backboard en route to the basket. Many coaches, including UCLA's great John Wooden, believe that when a shooter is at a 20- to 50-degree angle to the backboard and inside 15 feet, a bank shot is always the preferred shot. At 6-foot-4, Jones was the prototype of the tall guard who could run the floor and bang the boards, and had a rangy offensive game that gave opponents fits. One of the \"Jones Boys\" in Boston, Sam teamed with K. C. Jones in the Celtics' backcourt to create havoc in NBA arenas around the country.\nJones led Boston in scoring five times, and he averaged 20 points or better in four consecutive seasons (1965–1968). He scored 2,909 points in 154 playoff games (18.89 PPG), 92nd best in history as of the 2021 postseason.\nHonors.\nJones was inducted into the NAIA Basketball Hall of Fame in 1962. Seven years later, he was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame—the first African-American thus honored. Jones was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984. He was named to the NBA 25th Anniversary Team (1971), as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (1996), and the NBA 75th Anniversary Team (2021). He was part of the inaugural class inducted into the American Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.\nIn the 2021–2022 NBA season, the Boston Celtics wore a black band with the number 24 on their jersey, to honor Jones who died that year.\nPersonal life.\nJones was married to Gladys Chavis until her death in 2018. Together, they had five children. He lived for several decades in Silver Spring, Maryland, during which time he often served as a substitute teacher in the Montgomery County public school system. He resided in St. Augustine, Florida, in retirement.\nJones died on the evening of December 30, 2021, in Boca Raton, Florida. He was 88 years old."

The event took place on April 2, 2006, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois.\nThere were two main events, which were the main matches for each brand. The final match, which was the main match from the Raw brand, was John Cena versus Triple H for the WWE Championship, which Cena won after forcing Triple H to submit to the STFU. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was a triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship between champion Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio, and Randy Orton. Mysterio won the match and the World Heavyweight Championship after pinning Orton following a 619 and a West Coast Pop—during Mysterio's reign, the championship was simply called the World Championship due to Mysterio not being a heavyweight wrestler. \nFeatured matches on the undercard included a No Holds Barred match between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon, a Casket match between The Undertaker and Mark Henry, a WWE Women's Championship match between Mickie James and Trish Stratus, and an interpromotional Money in the Bank ladder match featuring Bobby Lashley, Finlay, Matt Hardy, Ric Flair, Shelton Benjamin and Rob Van Dam.\nWrestleMania 22 was the third WrestleMania to take place in the Chicago metropolitan area following WrestleMania 2 (which partially took place in the Chicago metropolitan area as well as Uniondale, NY and Los Angeles, CA) and WrestleMania 13. The Chicago metropolitan area portion of WrestleMania 2 as well as WrestleManias 13 and 22 all emanated from the Rosemont Horizon/Allstate Arena. Coincidentally, all 3 of the aforementioned WrestleManias did not have Roman numerals in their names. Tickets sold out in under two minutes, grossing US$2.5 million for the event, making it the highest grossing one-day event at the Allstate Arena. More than 17,155 people from 16 countries and 43 states attended, with millions more watching in more than 90 countries. WrestleMania 22 also marked the last WrestleMania to be held in a traditional arena, as every subsequent edition, excluding WrestleMania 36, has been held in a stadium.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania 22 was scheduled to be held on April 2, 2006, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Triple H over the WWE Championship. After failing to win the Royal Rumble match, Triple H participated in the 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. In the final match of the tournament, held on the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H faced Rob Van Dam and Big Show in a triple threat match. Triple H won the match after pinning Van Dam following a Pedigree.\nThe Road to WrestleMania tournament to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 22 was held between February 6 and February 20, 2006. The tournament brackets were:\nNotes:\nThe predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio, and Randy Orton over the World Heavyweight Championship. Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Orton, to earn a world championship match at WrestleMania. At No Way Out, Orton cheated to defeat Mysterio and win his WrestleMania 22 world championship match. Five days later, on the February 24 edition of \"SmackDown!\", SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long announced that the World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 22 would be a Triple Threat match involving Mysterio, Orton, and champion Angle.\nAnother primary feud from Raw was between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon. On the December 26, 2005, edition of \"Raw\", McMahon and Michaels had words ending with McMahon threatening that he could screw Michaels just like he did Bret Hart anytime he wanted. During the following couple of weeks on \"Raw\", McMahon had inflicted some humiliation on Michaels. On the January 23 edition of \"Raw\" when it was between Michaels and Shelton Benjamin with McMahon declaring that if Michaels were to lose, he would also lose his spot in the Royal Rumble match. Michaels won the match and kept his spot in the Royal Rumble match but a few moments later, McMahon met Michaels backstage then stated that lady luck was on his side. He also said that he wanted to turn back the clock to the days of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll then he asked Michaels to join him but got turned down, however, and McMahon last stated that Michaels' luck would run out at the Royal Rumble. At the Royal Rumble, during the Royal Rumble match, McMahon distracted Michaels as his music started to play. During that time, Shane McMahon, who was not an official entrant in the match, eliminated Michaels after attacking him from behind. One month later, on the February 27 edition of \"Raw\", Shane hit Michaels with a steel chair and forced him to \"kiss\" Vince's ass, thus joining Vince's \"Kiss My Ass Club\".&lt;ref name=\"2/27 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vince then announced that he and Michaels would face off against each other at WrestleMania. On \"Raw\" two weeks later, Vince forced Michaels to take a public drug test all due to Michaels being deceived and drugged by Vince's daughter, Stephanie McMahon on the March 6 edition of \"Raw\". During the test, however, Michaels threw his urine on both Vince and Shane.&lt;ref name=\"3/06 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, Michaels faced off against the Spirit Squad in a Steel Cage match. The Spirit Squad won the match by pinning Michaels after Shane interfered and slammed the cage door on Michaels. After the match, Shane continued attacking Michaels, causing him to bleed in the process, and executed a Coast 2 Coast. At \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII\", Michaels faced off against Shane in a Street Fight. Near the end of the match, Shane locked Michaels in the sharpshooter, and Vince ordered the match to end. Vince screwed Michaels, claiming he submitted to the move, and declared Shane the winner via submission. On the March 20 edition of \"Raw\", Vince announced that his match against Michaels at WrestleMania would now be a No Holds Barred match.\nOne of the featured matches on the undercard was a Casket match between The Undertaker and Mark Henry. On the March 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Undertaker challenged Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, after Undertaker executed a Tombstone piledriver, Henry came out and attacked Undertaker, causing the match to end via disqualification.&lt;ref name=\"3/03 SD!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Undertaker won the match, but since a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, he did not win the title. The following week, on \"SmackDown!\", Undertaker challenged Henry to a casket match at WrestleMania. On the March 18 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII\", Henry, along with his manager Daivari, called out The Undertaker. Undertaker came out, accompanied by Druids carrying a casket, and the two started attacking each other. Shortly after, Undertaker performed a chokeslam, followed by a Tombstone piledriver, on Daivari on the casket.\nOne of the main matches on the undercard was a singles match between Mickie James and Trish Stratus for the WWE Women's Championship. James debuted in WWE on the October 10, 2005, episode of \"Raw\" coming to the aid of then Women's Champion Stratus from an attack from Victoria. She wrestled under the gimmick of Stratus' biggest fan. The two competed in tag team action together frequently where James was becoming extremely obsessed with Stratus. James became the number one contender for the Women's Championship on the December 12 episode of \"Raw\" by defeating Victoria in a match to determine who would face Stratus at New Year's Revolution. She was unable to win the title at New Year's Revolution. The storyline between James and Stratus developed into a lesbian angle after James initiated an intimate kiss with Stratus under the mistletoe and complimented on the size of her breasts. At the Royal Rumble James confessed to Stratus that she loved her. It finally became too much for Stratus as she then told James that they needed time apart. The two teamed together at \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII\" to defeat the team of Victoria and Candice Michelle. After the match, James honored Stratus' wish to have time apart, but later attempted to kiss her, and attacked Stratus after she refused.\nThe secondary Divas feud entering the event was between Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle. Torrie and Candice became villains when they were traded to the Raw roster on August 22, 2005, and later aligned with Victoria to form the stable known as Vince's Devils. On the February 27, 2006, edition of \"Raw\", Candice failed to defeat Trish Stratus in a match for Stratus' WWE Women's Championship, and slapped Torrie in a backstage segment after the match; showing signs of tension between the two. On the following week's edition of \"Raw\", the evil Candice unveiled her Playboy cover and then attempted to force Torrie to admit that her cover was hotter than both of Torrie's Playboy covers. When Torrie refused, Candice and Victoria both attacked her in the ring, resulting in a face turn from Torrie. It was later announced that Torrie and Candice would face each other in a Playboy Pillow Fight at WrestleMania 22.\nEvent.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, an 18-man interpromotional battle royal was held. Viscera won by last eliminating Snitsky. Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams sang \"America the Beautiful\" before the show.\nThe opening match was for the World Tag Team Championship between champions Big Show and Kane and Carlito and Chris Masters. Kane executed a big boot on Masters that started with Masters trying to interrupt a choke slam, then chokeslammed Carlito to get the victory and retain the titles.\nThe second match was the Money in the Bank ladder match between Rob Van Dam, Shelton Benjamin, Ric Flair, Finlay, Bobby Lashley, and Matt Hardy. In the end, Van Dam climbed the ladder but was stopped when Benjamin springboarded onto the ladder and the two fought. Hardy came out with a second ladder and joined the two. Van Dam pushed Hardy and Benjamin's ladder, sending them both smashing on the floor. Van Dam grabbed the briefcase and won the match.\nHoward Finkel introduced the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2006: \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund, \"Sensational\" Sherri Martel, Tony Atlas, Verne Gagne, William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, and The Blackjacks (Blackjack Mulligan and Blackjack Lanza) attended the event while Eddie Guerrero was represented by his wife Vickie Guerrero and Eddie's nephew Chavo Guerrero Jr. Bret Hart did not attend the event as he was not comfortable.\nThe third match was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield and Chris Benoit for the WWE United States Championship. During JBL's entrance, the entrance ramp was raised and JBL's limousine drove out from underneath. JBL attempted a Clothesline From Hell on Benoit, who avoided the move and applied in the Crippler Crossface. JBL countered and used the ropes for leverage to win the match.\nThe fourth match was a hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley. In the end, Foley pulled out a table but Lita hit Foley in between the legs with a barbed wire bat and lit the table, allowing Edge to perform a Spear on Foley through the flaming table on the outside for the victory. Both wrestlers had abrasions and were covered in blood from the barbed wire bat and Foley's barbed wire sock; Edge went into shock after the match.\nNext, Booker T and Sharmell faced The Boogeyman in a handicap match. During the match, Boogeyman kissed Sharmell with a mouth full of worms, causing her to flee to the back. Boogeyman executed a Falling Chokebomb on Booker for the victory.\nThe sixth match was a Divas match between Trish Stratus and Mickie James for the WWE Women's Championship. Mickie executed a Mick Kick on Trish to win the match and the WWE Women's Championship. Despite portraying a psychotic heel, Mickie James was audibly cheered by the crowd during the match.\nNext, The Undertaker faced Mark Henry in a casket match. Undertaker took the advantage and executed a Last Ride on Henry. While Henry was out of the ring, Undertaker executed a suicide dive over the top rope. Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Henry and pushed him into the casket to win the match and improve his WrestleMania record to 14–0.\nThe eighth match was a No Holds Barred match between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon. Michaels put McMahon on a table and put a trashcan over McMahon's head. Michaels then climbed on the top of a ladder and executed a diving elbow drop on McMahon through the table. Michaels then executed Sweet Chin Music on McMahon to win the match.\nNext, Kurt Angle defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton in a triple threat match. During Mysterio's entrance, P.O.D. performed Mysterio's music entrance live. In the end, Mysterio performed a 619 on Orton followed by a West Coast Pop to win the title. After the match, Mysterio celebrated with Chavo and Vickie Guerrero.\nThe tenth match was a \"Playboy\" pillow fight between Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle. Wilson pulled Candice's dress and Candice later pulled Wilson's dress. The match ended with Wilson pinning Candice with a roll-up for the win.\nIn the main event, John Cena defended his WWE Championship against Triple H. Triple H came out to the ring on a throne dressed as a Conan-type king, while Cena came out with a tommy gun and was accompanied by a group of \"gangsters\" (one of which was future WWE Champion and Chicago native CM Punk, who had recently signed with WWE and, at the time, was performing with Ohio Valley Wrestling,) in a 1940s Chicago-era vehicle. The match was evenly matched with both men getting the advantage over each other. Triple H tried a Pedigree, but Cena countered with an FU for a near-fall. Cena applied the STFU but Triple H reached the ropes. Triple H tried another Pedigree, but was countered into the STF again by Cena, to which Triple H submitted, meaning Cena retained the WWE Championship.\nReception.\nWrestleMania 22 was largely praised by various wrestling publications and websites. Writing for Canadian Online Explorer's \"Slam! Sports\" vertical, Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk stated that \"With more wrestling, fewer interviews, and more pageantry than the last several editions, this year's 'Mania had a \"Big Time\" feel to it\". He rated the overall event 8 out of 10 stars, which was a higher rating than the previous year's event. The main event between Triple H and John Cena for the WWE Championship was rated 8.5 out of 10 stars, the Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio and Randy Orton was rated 8.5 out of 10 stars, the No Holds Barred match between Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon received a perfect 10 out of 10 stars, the Casket match between Mark Henry and The Undertaker was rated 7 out of 10 stars, the Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley was rated 8.5 out of 10 stars and the Money in the Bank ladder match was rated 7 out of 10 stars. Robert Leighty Jr of \"411mania\" gave the event an overall score of 8.0 out of 10.0 commented on how \"This is a pretty solid show as both title matches deliver in one aspect or another. Shawn tries to steal the show again, but Edge and Foley take that honor in a crazy-ass brawl. This was the last Mania held in an arena and it's a fun atmosphere because of the jacked-up crowd. Throw in another solid Money in the Bank Match, and a memorable Women's Title match, and you have a fun show all around!\"\nOver the years, WrestleMania 22 became regarded as one of the better WrestleManias in its history. In their 2018 ranking of every WrestleMania from worst to best, Cultaholic placed WrestleMania 22 as the fifth best of all-time. In their YouTube video explaining their rankings, presenter Adam Pacitti stated that \"fans who attended to this 'Mania were treated to a quadruple-header of wonderful matches,\" praising the main event between Triple H and Cena as well as the hardcore match between Edge and Foley, the Michaels beatdown of McMahon, and the WWE Women's Championship match between Mickie James and Trish Stratus (\"the first good women's match in 'Mania history...intense, controversial, and, most importantly, entertaining\"). John Canton of TJR Wrestling Reviews praised the entire event, and called Edge vs. Mick Foley the best match of the show. To date Edge spearing Mick Foley into a flaming table remains one of the most iconic and memorable moments in pro wrestling history. The match itself has been highly regarded in recent years and was a subject of the WWE's Untold Series on the WWE Network and NBC's Peacock.\nAftermath.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", Triple H said to John Cena that he lost at WrestleMania 22 because he underestimated the champ. Edge then came out and said to Triple H that he deserved another WWE Championship match because he defeated Mick Foley in a Hardcore match. Over the next few weeks, all three men faced each other in Handicap matches, which all three men won over the three-week period by pinning and making each other submit, respectively. It was then announced that the main event at Backlash would be a Triple Threat Match for the WWE Championship between Cena, Edge and Triple H. At Backlash, Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship via pinfall on Triple H with a jackknife roll-up, but after the match, Triple H attacked Cena, Edge and the referee with a sledgehammer.\nAfter WrestleMania, Shawn Michaels continued to feud with Vince McMahon. At Backlash, Michaels teamed up with \"God\" to face Vince and Shane McMahon. At Backlash, Michaels suffered a loss when the Spirit Squad interfered on behalf of The McMahons. Triple H became involved in the feud as well, initially on Vince and Shane's side, but on May 22, 2006, he attacked the Spirit Squad after being ordered to the ring by McMahon to \"finish off\" Michaels. On the June 12, 2006, edition of \"Raw\", Vince announced that Triple H would face the Spirit Squad in a 5 on 1 Handicap Gauntlet match. Vince called Mitch out last, as throughout the match he had called out the other four members one-by-one, instead Mitch was thrown out from the curtain by Michaels. Michaels ran down the ramp and started attacking the Spirit Squad with Triple H, marking the return of D-Generation X (D-X). At Vengeance, D-X faced the Spirit Squad in a 5 on 2 Handicap match, which D-X won after both Michaels and Triple H pinned Kenny and Mikey, respectively.\nMickie James continued to feud with Trish Stratus. At Backlash, Stratus won the match by disqualification, legitimately dislocating her shoulder in the process. Due to regulations by the WWE, a title cannot change hands via disqualification. As a result, James was still champion. Whilst injured, Stratus still appeared on-screen and during the storyline, Beth Phoenix made her debut as Stratus' ally, claiming that James had wronged Phoenix in the past. She returned to the ring on the June 26 episode of \"Raw\", where she cleanly lost a Women's Championship match against James, thus ending the feud.\nRey Mysterio went on to feud with John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 5 edition of \"SmackDown!\", after Mysterio expressed his feelings about being World Heavyweight Champion, JBL came out and declared himself the number one contender.&lt;ref name=\"WWE - 5/05 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 5/05 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mysterio reacted by saying that he would fight anyone at any time. In turn, JBL announced that Mysterio would face off against Mark Henry later that night. Henry won the match via pinfall. The next week on \"SmackDown!\", JBL announced that Mysterio would take on The Great Khali. Khali won the match via pinfall.&lt;ref name=\"WWE - 5/12 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 5/12 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Judgment Day, Mysterio defeated JBL by pinfall after performing a Frog Splash. After the pay-per view, the feud ended between the two when JBL's rematch against Mysterio turned into his last match if he failed to win the World Championship.\nThe next night on \"Raw\", saw the return of Jamal, who last appeared on WWE programming in 2003 and going by the name of Umaga, as he attacked Ric Flair. The two would go on to wrestle at Backlash. Umaga's run would saw him winning the Intercontinental Championship and lasted until June 2009; he would later pass away in December at the age of 36 after a heart attack.\nThe Undertaker's feud with Mark Henry would come to an end after the two-faced off on \"SmackDown!\", only to be interrupted by the debuting The Great Khali who attacked The Undertaker.\nRob Van Dam would announce that he would cash in his Money in the Bank against John Cena at ECW One Night Stand. Van Dam would go on to win the match capturing his first WWE Championship."

        "title": "Casper (skateboarding)",
        "text": "Casper is a freestyle skateboarding trick that was invented by Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden in the late 1970s. Boyden had a very pale skin and he was nicknamed after the cartoon ghost. The modern casper was invented by Rodney Mullen in the late 1980s.\nDuring a casper the skateboarder holds the skateboard upside down with his feet and balances on the tip of the tail. The skateboarder stands on the bottom side of the tail while his front foot is under the front part of the board touching the griptape and keeping it from touching the ground.\nCasper was originally performed without jumping but it can also be performed from a half flip. When doing an original casper the skateboarder stands on the board so that the heel of his back foot is on the tail and the ball and toes are hanging from the side. The front foot rests on the opposite edge of the board near the trucks. The skateboarder then jumps up to unweight the board and presses the edge of the deck with his front foot to make the board flip over. When the board has flipped upside down the skateboarder catches it with his front foot and places his back foot on the now upside down tail. After balancing in this stance the skateboarder usually jumps up a bit, lifts his back foot from the board and uses his front foot to turn the board back to its normal position with a motion that resembles an impossible. The board is turned upside down with the tip of the tail on the ground acting as a fulcrum, the front foot under the front of the board holding it up acting as the effort, and the back foot resting on top of the back truck as the load. Note that the skateboarder's feet never touch the ground during this trick.\nA modern casper is performed like a kickflip, but the skateboarder catches the board after it has flipped upside down and lands in the casper stance. A casper can be performed either when standing still or when moving. The balancing can also involve sliding on the tip of the tail. Exiting the trick can involve rotating, flipping or wrapping the board around the foot. It is recommended that beginners learning to incorporate the Casper initiate the move while riding fakie; riding tail-first allows the use of momentum to assist in lifting the nose of the board.\nThe reverse of this trick is the Anti-casper which is the same principle only applied a half-impossible into a casper on the nose of the board.\nA comprehensive demonstration of the Casper, including complex variations on the theme and tricks involving the Casper can be seen in the Rodney Mullen segment of the 1994 film \"Second Hand Smoke\", by Plan B.\nThere are many types of \"casper tricks\", such as the casper slide (A trick in which a rider does a half-kickflip so that they are in casper stance, then sliding/dragging the tail of the board on the ground so that the rider essentially slides), and the casper/hospital flip (where the rider does a half-kickflip, then uses their feet to spin the board in a 180 while the board also flips back to normal position). There is much debate whether the casper and hospital flip are the same. However, the casper flip uses both feet to spin the board, while the hospital flip only uses one foot, similar to a shuvit."

        "title": "Cycling probe technology",
        "text": "Cycling probe technology (CPT) is a molecular biological technique for detecting specific DNA sequences. CPT operates under isothermal conditions. In some applications, CPT offers an alternative to PCR. However, unlike PCR, CPT does not generate multiple copies of the target DNA itself, and the amplification of the signal is linear, in contrast to the exponential amplification of the target DNA in PCR. CPT uses a sequence specific chimeric probe which hybridizes to a complementary target DNA sequence and becomes a substrate for RNase H. Cleavage occurs at the RNA internucleotide linkages and results in dissociation of the probe from the target, thereby making it available for the next probe molecule. Integrated electrokinetic systems have been developed for use in CPT.\nProbe.\nCycling probe technology makes use of a chimeric nucleic acid probe to detect the presence of a particular DNA sequence. The chimeric probe consists of an RNA segment sandwiched between two DNA segments. The RNA segment contains 4 contiguous purine nucleotides. The probes should be less than 30 nucleotides in length and designed to minimize intra-probe and inter-probe interactions.\nProcess.\nCycling probe technology utilizes a cyclic, isothermal process that begins with the hybridization of the chimeric probe with the target DNA. Once hybridized, the probe becomes a suitable substrate for RNase H. RNase H, an endonuclease, cleaves the RNA portion of the probe, resulting in two chimeric fragments. The melting temperature (Tm) of the newly cleaved fragments is lower than the melting temperature of original probe. Because the CPT reaction is isothermally kept just above the melting point of the original probe, the cleaved fragments dissociate from the target DNA. Once dissociated, the target DNA is free to hybridize with a new probe, beginning the cycle again.\nAfter the fragments have been cleaved and dissociated, they become detectable. A common strategy for detecting the fragments involves fluorescence. With this method, a fluorescent marker is attached to the 5’ end of the probe and a quencher is attached to the 3’ end of the probe. When RNase H cleaves the probe, the quencher and fluorescent marker separate, increasing the intensity of the fluorescent marker. Cleaved fragments can alternatively be detected via amplification (e.g., PCR) or further modification to allow for other chemical means of detection.\nWhen working with small concentrations of target DNA, the CPT protocol can be modified to increase specificity and efficiency. Increasing allotted time has been shown to improve probe cleavage efficiency. Both increasing RNase H concentrations and use of a probe that isn't prone to inter-probe and intra-probe interactions has been shown to increase specificity.\nAdvantages.\nBecause cycling probe technology does not involve the amplification of target DNA, CPT has a lower risk of cross contamination than PCR. In addition, CPT is faster than PCR and doesn't require a specialized thermocycler. CPT also does not require running CPT products on a gel.\nDisadvantages.\nCPT requires specialized chimeric probes, making CPT assays more expensive than PCR. Because CPT probes are so specific, a new probe must be designed for each unique assay, further increasing cost. Clinical implementation is hampered financially, but it is also limited by the possibility of samples containing nonspecific RNases other than RNase H.\nApplications.\nCPT can be used to detect specific DNA sequences and by extension specific genotypes. For example, CPT can be used to distinguish GMO produce from non-GMO produce. Clinically, CPT can be used as an alternative to cell culturing in order to detect antibacterial resistance of a pathogen.\nCPT, at its core, detects whether a specific sequence is present in a sample. But because cleaved probes accumulate following linear rate kinetics, the amount of target DNA can be quantified. Consequently, CPT has been used to quantify the number of non-coding repeats in organisms.\nCPT can be used in conjunction with other technologies, like molecular beacons and qPCR."

        "title": "1970–71 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1970 season began on December 26, 1970. The postseason tournament concluded with the Baltimore Colts defeating the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V, 16–13, on January 17, 1971, at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.\nThis was the first playoff tournament after the AFL–NFL merger. An eight-team playoff tournament was designed, with four clubs from each conference qualifying. Along with the three division winners in each conference, one wild card team, the second place team with the best record from each conference, was added to the tournament. The first round was named the \"Divisional Playoffs\", while the Conference Championship games were moved to the second playoff round and the Super Bowl became the league's championship game.\nHowever, the home teams in the playoffs were still decided based on a yearly divisional rotation, excluding the wild card teams, who would always play on the road. Also, a rule was made that two teams from the same division could not meet in the Divisional Playoffs. In the rotation system, teams who hosted and won against the wild card team in the Divisional playoffs never could host the Conference Championship game. Conversely, this meant that the winner of Divisional playoff games that were exclusively between division winners always hosted the Conference Championship game.\nThis is the most recent year in which all playoff games matched up two teams that had yet to meet in the postseason in a previous year.\nParticipants.\nFollowing the rotational system, the winner of the NFC Central, the Minnesota Vikings, would have met the wild card team. With the Detroit Lions the wild card team was from the same division and hence, the home teams of the NFC switched their opponents.\nThe defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs finished the season 7–5–2, runner-up in the AFC West.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, CBS televised the NFC playoff games, while NBC broadcast the AFC games and Super Bowl V.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 26, 1970.\nAFC: Baltimore Colts 17, Cincinnati Bengals 0.\nThe Bengals started out their first season as an NFL team 1–6, but stormed into the playoffs by winning their last seven games. However, their comeback season came to a crushing halt in Baltimore, where the Colts' defense limited the Bengals to eight first downs and 139 total yards of offense. By the end of the first three quarters, the Bengals had just 47 yards and two first downs.\nThe closest Cincinnati came to scoring was Horst Muhlmann's 49-yard field goal attempt which was blocked by Colts linebacker Ray May. Meanwhile, Baltimore quarterback Johnny Unitas threw two touchdown passes: a 45-yard completion to Roy Jefferson in the first quarter and a 53-yard reception to Eddie Hinton in the fourth period. Jim O'Brien added a 44-yard field goal in the second quarter. Rookie running back Norm Bulaich rushed for 116 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Bengals and Colts. The crowd of 51,127 ended the Colts' streak of 51 consecutive sellouts which began in 1958. The gametime temperature of 30 °F with a wind chill of 0 °F and winds up to 30 miles per hour was a factor.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 5, Detroit Lions 0.\nAlthough they recorded 209 rushing yards, the Cowboys could only manage a field goal and a safety, but still managed to shut out the Lions. The Cowboy defense held Lions quarterback Greg Landry to 48 passing yards. In addition, they contained his running as Landry was an excellent running QB; he averaged 10 yards per carry and gained 350 yards during the regular season. However, in this game he was held to 15 yards rushing.\nIn the first quarter, Cowboys rookie safety Charlie Waters recovered a fumble from Landry and returned it nine yards to his own 45. A 14-yard completion from Craig Morton to fullback Walt Garrison and a pair of six-yard runs by Duane Thomas then got the team close enough for Mike Clark's 26-yard field goal to give the Cowboys a 3–0 lead. In the second quarter, Detroit managed to advance the ball to the Dallas 29, but a jarring tackle by defensive end Larry Cole stripped the ball from RB Altie Taylor and Waters recorded his second fumble recovery to keep Detroit scoreless. The Lions would not move the ball into Dallas territory again until 59 seconds remained in the game.\nIn the final period, Dallas marched 76 yards in 15 plays, 51 of those yards from Thomas, to advance to the Detroit one-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal on fourth down, the Cowboys elected to give the ball to Thomas, who was stopped short of the goal line. But three plays later, Dallas defensive end George Andrie sacked Landry for a safety. Bill Munson replaced Landry and led the Lions down field in the waning moments, including a 39-yard completion to Earl McCullouch on the Dallas 29 that converted a fourth down, but the Cowboys clinched the victory in the final moments with Mel Renfro's interception at their own 11-yard line.\nThe contest remains the lowest-scoring postseason game in NFL history and was just the second time in league history a game ended with a 5–0 score. It was the first playoff game without a touchdown in twenty years.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Lions and Cowboys.\nSunday, December 27, 1970.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 17, Minnesota Vikings 14.\nThe 10–3–1 49ers, making their first playoff game since 1957, stunned the heavily favored Vikings, the defending NFL champions who had finished the regular season with an NFL best record at 12–2. The 49ers defeated the Vikings in Minnesota, despite losing three of five fumbles; Minnesota had four turnovers. The loss ended a 16-game home winning streak at Metropolitan Stadium for the Vikings, including postseason.\nQuarterback John Brodie led the 49ers to their first NFL playoff victory by throwing for 201 yards and touchdown and rushing for another. The Vikings scored first when Minnesota defensive back Paul Krause picked up San Francisco running back Ken Willard's fumble in midair and returned it 22 yards for a touchdown. The 49ers responded by scoring 17 unanswered points, first with Brodie's 24-yard touchdown pass to Dick Witcher. Then in the second quarter, San Francisco converted a Vikings fumble into Bruce Gossett's 40-yard field goal. Brodie scored the clinching touchdown, a one-yard run, with 1:20 left. Minnesota's 24-yard touchdown pass was completed with only seven seconds left in the game, and ended with just one second remaining on the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the 49ers and Vikings.\nAFC: Oakland Raiders 21, Miami Dolphins 14.\nQuarterback Daryle Lamonica threw two touchdown passes and the Raiders scored 14-points in the second half to defeat the Dolphins 21–14 in a sea of mud at the Oakland Coliseum.\nIn the first quarter, both teams blew scoring chances on drives deep into opposing territory, with Raiders kicker George Blanda driving a 23-yard field goal attempt wide right and Miami's Garo Yepremian missing a kick from 24 yards. In the second quarter, Dolphins defensive end Bill Stanfill recovered a fumble from Charlie Smith on the Raiders 19 that set up Bob Griese's 16-yard touchdown pass to Paul Warfield. With less than five minutes left in the half, Raiders quarterback Daryle Lamonica led the team on a 62-yard scoring drive to tie the game 7–7, completing a 21-yard pass to tight end Raymond Chester and an 11-yarder to Fred Biletnikoff before connecting with Biletnikoff in the end zone from 22 yards out.\nOakland took the second half kickoff and drove all the way to the Dolphins' two-yard line, but Smith lost another fumble, this one recovered by defensive back Jake Scott, and the Raiders were unable to break the tie. On the first play after the turnover, Miami quarterback Bob Griese hooked up with Paul Warfield for 24-yard gain. But later in the drive, he was sacked for a 12-yard loss. Faced with third down and 19, Griese had to go deep to attempt a first down completion. He attempted to throw to Warfield, only to see his pass intercepted by Willie Brown and returned 50 yards for a touchdown, giving the Raiders a 14–7 lead.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Miami drove into scoring range, but came up empty when Yepremian missed another field goal attempt from 24 yards. Two plays later, on third down and 12, Lamonica fired a pass to Rod Sherman, who took off for an 82-yard touchdown completion to put the Raiders up 21–7. Miami responded by picking up five first downs on a 69-yard drive that ended with Griese's seven-yard touchdown pass to Willie Richardson. Then with 2:22 left, they managed for force a punt, giving them one last chance to drive for a tying touchdown. However, the Raiders forced a turnover on downs, then ran out the clock.\nLamonica finished the game 8/16 for 187 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Raiders.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 3, 1971.\nAFC: Baltimore Colts 27, Oakland Raiders 17.\nColts quarterback Johnny Unitas's 68-yard touchdown pass to Ray Perkins in the fourth quarter gave the Colts a two-score lead that the Raiders could not overcome, sending his team to their second Super Bowl in the last three years.\nBaltimore dominated the first quarter, holding the Raiders to six plays and one completion, while Unitas led them to the four-yard line, where Jim O'Brien's 16-yard field goal gave them a 3–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, a massive hit by Colts defensive tackle Bubba Smith knocked Oakland QB Daryle Lamonica out of the game, and he was replaced by George Blanda. Later on, Willie Brown narrowly dropped an interception on a deep pass from Unitas. At the time this did not seem to matter much, as the incomplete pass was on third down and the Colts had to punt. But returner George Atkinson fumbled David Lee's kick and the Colts' running back Sam Havrilak recovered with excellent field position. Unitas then completed a 43-yard pass to Eddie Hinton at the two-yard line, and Norm Bulaich scored a touchdown run on the next play, increasing the lead to 10–0. Blanda then led the Raiders back, and with the aid of a roughing the punter penalty, he got them close enough for a 48-yard field goal, which he kicked himself to cut the score 10–3 at the end of the half.\nOakland tied the score early in the third quarter with Blanda's 38-yard touchdown pass to Fred Biletnikoff. Unitas responded with two key long completions to Hinton that set up O'Brien's 23-yard field goal to retake the lead at 13–10. Later in the quarter, Bulaich scored on an 11-yard touchdown run, giving the Colts a 20–10 lead going into the fourth quarter.\nNow down by two scores with just one quarter left, Blanda got the Raiders rolling on a long touchdown drive. Running back Charlie Smith picked up 20 yards on a draw play (the longest run of the game for either team). Then Blanda fooled the Colts' defense with a fake handoff before firing a pass to Warren Wells for a 37-yard gain to the Colts 11. Blanda eventually finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Wells on third down, making the score 20–17. The momentum seemed to be swinging back in their favor when they forced the Colts into a third and 11 situation on their own 32-yard line on the next drive. On the next play, Unitas threw a deep pass to a wide open Perkins, who raced down the left sideline for a 68-yard touchdown completion that gave the Colts a 27–17 lead. This would prove to be the last score of the game as the Raiders were shut out in the final 12 minutes, with Blanda throwing two interceptions deep in Baltimore territory.\nBlanda finished the game completing 17 of 32 passes for 271 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions. At 43 years old, he was the oldest quarterback ever to play in a championship game. His top target was Wells, who caught five passes for 108 yards and a touchdown. Unitas completed 11 of 30 passes for 245 yards and a touchdown. The Colts leading receiver was Hinton, who caught eight passes for 115 yards. Bubba Smith and Ray Hilton each had two sacks, along with Raiders defensive end Ben Davidson.\nThis would turn out to be the final home playoff win for the Colts in Baltimore before they moved to Indianapolis in 1984.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Raiders and Colts.\nThis would be the only time Baltimore hosted an AFC Championship game until the 2023 season.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 17, San Francisco 49ers 10.\nAlthough Dallas quarterback Craig Morton only completed 7 out of 22 passes for 101 yards, rookie halfback Duane Thomas rushed for 143 yards and caught two passes for 24 as Dallas converted two third quarter interceptions into 14 points to defeat the 49ers.\nOn the second drive of the game, 49ers quarterback John Brodie's 42-yard completion to Gene Washington at the Cowboys nine-yard line set up Bruce Gossett's 16-yard field goal to give the team a 3–0 lead, but only after Brodie misfired on a pass to fullback Ken Willard, who was open in the end zone. This would be the only score of the half for San Francisco. Dallas fared little better, with Mike Clark missing a field goal from 40 yards out, and later kicking a 21-yard field goal to tie the game, 3–3.\nAfter each team punted once in the second half, San Francisco had the ball on their own 21-yard line. On the first play, Brodie was sacked by linebacker Dave Edwards for a seven-yard loss. Then on second down, Lee Roy Jordan intercepted Brodie's pass and returned it four yards to the 13, where Thomas scored a touchdown run for Dallas on the next play, breaking three tackles en route to the end zone. On San Francisco's next series, Mel Renfro picked off a pass from Brodie and returned it 19 yards to the Cowboys' 38-yard line, setting off a 62-yard scoring drive for his team. The key player on the drive was fullback Walt Garrison, who had a 12-yard carry, gained 24 yards on a screen pass, and finished it off with a five-yard touchdown catch from Morton to give the Cowboys a 17–3 lead.\nSan Francisco responded with an eight-play, 72-yard drive to score on Brodie's 26-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dick Witcher and cut the score to 17–10 going into the fourth quarter, but they were shut out for the rest of the game. They nearly got a big scoring chance when Thomas fumbled the ball, but receiver Reggie Rucker recovered it, allowing Dallas to keep possession and take a lot of time off the clock with a drive to the 49ers 17-yard line. Clark missed a field goal attempt from there, giving San Francisco a chance to drive for the tying touchdown, but the farthest they could make it was to the Dallas 39, and after Renfro broke up a third down pass, Gossett missed a field goal from 47 yards out, and 49ers would not threaten to score again.\nThis was the 49ers' first playoff game at home since 1957 and the team's last home game to be played at Kezar Stadium. Johnny Mathis sang the national anthem, and Tony Bennett performed his signature song \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" at halftime.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cowboys and 49ers.\nSuper Bowl V: Baltimore Colts 16, Dallas Cowboys 13.\nThis is the only Super Bowl meeting between the Colts and Cowboys."

        "title": "Mark Ellis (baseball)",
        "text": "Mark William Ellis (born June 6, 1977) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played the majority of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career for the Oakland Athletics, and also appeared for the Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals. Ellis posted a career .991 fielding percentage, the fifth-best all-time for a second baseman in MLB history at the time of his retirement.\nEarly career.\nEllis was born in Rapid City, South Dakota. Ellis graduated from Stevens High School in Rapid City in 1995. Also in Ellis' graduating class was WNBA star Becky Hammon. They were voted by their peers as male and female \"Class Athletes\" of the '95 graduating class.\nEllis is one of three players to have made it to the Major Leagues who played for the Rapid City Post 22 American Legion baseball program; the others are Kelvin Torve and Dave Collins. As a 16-year-old, Ellis was the starting shortstop for the 1993 Rapid City Post 22 varsity \"Hardhat\" baseball team that touted a 70–5 record and won the national title in Roseburg, Oregon. In the back-to-back years (1994 &amp; 1995), Ellis earned South Dakota American Legion Player of the Year honors. In 2012, American Legion Baseball named Ellis the program's Graduate of the Year.\nHe went on to play for the University of Florida Gators baseball program and was the MVP of the Gainesville regional at the 1998 College World Series. Although he has played his Major League career at second base, he was the starting third baseman at Florida, where that position was nicknamed \"Ellis Island\" due to Ellis' tremendous range and all-around fielding prowess. \nEllis was a ninth-round selection by the Kansas City Royals in the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in the Royals' farm system in 1999 and 2000, where he was a Short-Season A All-Star in 1999 and a Carolina League All-Star in 2000.\nOn January 1, 2001, he was acquired by the Oakland Athletics along with outfielder Johnny Damon and pitcher Cory Lidle in a three-team trade with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the Royals for outfielder Ben Grieve, shortstop Ángel Berroa, and catcher A. J. Hinch. In 2001, with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, he hit .273 in 132 games with 10 home runs.\nMajor league career.\nOakland Athletics.\nEllis made his Major League debut on April 9, 2002, for the Athletics against the Texas Rangers, pinch-running in the eighth inning for Jeremy Giambi. He remained in the game and ground out to short in the 10th inning. He recorded his first base hit, in his first Major League start, on April 18 against the Anaheim Angels, a single to left field off of Ramón Ortiz. His first home run was hit on June 28, 2002, off of San Francisco Giants pitcher Jay Witasick. For the 2002 season, his batting was .272 in 98 games. Ellis hit .248 the following season, but missed the entire 2004 season due to a torn labrum in his right shoulder resulting from a collision with shortstop Bobby Crosby in a spring training game against the Chicago Cubs. In 2005, he returned to the Athletics and led the team in batting average (.316), on-base percentage (.384), and slugging average (.477) as the team's regular second baseman.\nIn 2006, Ellis broke Bret Boone's single-season American League record for a second baseman with a .99685 fielding percentage, although the Gold Glove Award went to the Royals' Mark Grudzielanek, who finished with a fielding percentage of .994, inferior to that of Ellis'. Note, the Gold Glove Award is not issued to the best fielding percentage at a position; rather, it is the result of voting by MLB managers and coaches.\nEllis missed most of the A's 2006 post-season due to a hand injury suffered during Game 2 of the American League Division Series against the Minnesota Twins.\nOn June 4, 2007, Ellis became only the sixth player in Oakland Athletics history to hit for the cycle. On July 23, 2007, he had his first career multi-home run game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. On August 5, 2007, he tied the A's team record for consecutive error-less games by a second baseman at 70 games.\nEllis missed the last two months of the 2008 season due to cartilage damage in his shoulder. He underwent successful surgery that also fixed a torn labrum from a previous injury.\nIn October 2008, the Athletics signed Ellis to an $11 million contract through 2010, with an option of extending the deal an additional season.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn June 30, 2011, Ellis was traded to the Colorado Rockies for Bruce Billings and a player to be named later. On September 30, the Athletics announced that they received 22-year-old outfielder Eliezer Mesa to complete the deal.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn November 15, 2011, Ellis signed a two-year, $8.75 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nAfter a strong start, Ellis's leg was severely injured on May 20, 2012, by a hard slide from Tyler Greene of the St. Louis Cardinals while Ellis was attempting to turn a double play. Initially saying that he was okay, Ellis did not go to the hospital until the following day when he experienced extreme discomfort and swelling in his lower leg. After performing a fasciotomy to allow room within his leg for the swollen muscle tissue, his doctor later said that Ellis might have lost his leg if the surgery had been performed only six or seven hours later than it was. Doctors said Ellis' injury was a rare one for athletes, but more common for victims of car accidents. Ellis was expected to be out for six weeks and did not rejoin the Dodgers till July 4.\nOverall, he appeared in 110 games for the Dodgers in 2012, hitting .258 with 7 home runs and 31 RBI.\nIn 2013, Ellis remained relatively healthy and played in 126 games. He hit .270 with 6 home runs and 48 RBI, helping the Dodgers win the National League West Division's championship and a first-round playoff series over the Atlanta Braves before the team was eliminated in the National League Championship Series.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nEllis signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on December 16, 2013. He was placed on the disabled list with an oblique strain on August 19, 2014, after hitting a career-low .192 for the Cardinals.\nOn February 25, 2015, Ellis announced his retirement.\nPersonal life.\nEllis and his wife, Sarah, have three children. They purchased a home in Scottsdale, Arizona, in 2007, but sold it in 2020."

Lee batted and threw right-handed. He is the son of former major league pitcher Thornton Lee.\nLee attended University of Arizona. Signed by the Tigers as an amateur free agent in 1956, he debuted in the 1957 season. After two years with the Tigers, he was sent to the Senators. In 1962 Lee went to the Angels. He finished his career with the Cubs in 1966. Lee was a journeyman pitcher who divided his playing time jumping between the rotation and the bullpen. His most productive season came in 1962 with Minnesota and the Angels, when he compiled career-highs in victories (11), strikeouts (102), shutouts (2) and innings pitched ().\nOn September 2, 1960, Lee surrendered a home run to Ted Williams in the first game of a doubleheader between the Senators and Boston Red Sox. 21 years before, in his rookie season, Williams hit a home run off Don's father Thornton Lee, then with the Chicago White Sox, on September 17, 1939. With this feat, Williams became the only player in major league history to hit home runs against a father and son.\nIn a nine-season career, Lee posted a 40–44 record with 467 strikeouts, a 3.61 ERA, 11 saves, and innings in 244 games played (97 as a starter)."

        "text": "Harry \"Apple Cheeks\" Lumley (November 11, 1926 – September 13, 1998) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Boston Bruins between 1943 and 1960. He won the Vezina Trophy for being the goaltender to allow the fewest goals against in 1954, and won the Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 1950. In 1980 Lumley was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Owen Sound, Ontario, Lumley—known as \"Apple Cheeks\"—grew up playing local minor sports, but took quickly to hockey and wound up being a top-notch goaltender. Lumley starred for several years with the Owen Sound Mercurys and later with the Owen Sound Orphans (who were called that because they could not find a sponsor) and then the Barrie Colts. He also played with the Indianapolis Capitals of the American Hockey League, a minor league team of the Detroit Red Wings.\nNHL career.\nLumley made his professional debut in the National Hockey League, however, with the New York Rangers in the 1943–44 season, when he was loaned to the Rangers for a single game and appeared in 20 minutes of play. He was (and remains) the youngest goaltender to play in the NHL, as he was 17 years old.\nIn the 1950 playoffs, Lumley led the Red Wings to a Stanley Cup championship, recording three shutouts and a 1.85 GAA in fourteen games. After his performance, however, Jack Adams traded Lumley to the Chicago Black Hawks; Terry Sawchuk became the new goaltender for the Red Wings.\nAfter playing with the Black Hawks for two seasons, he was again traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1953–54 season, Lumley won the Vezina Trophy, presented annually to the NHL's best goalie, with a GAA of 1.86. His 13 shutouts that year was a modern National Hockey League record that stood until Chicago's Tony Esposito recorded 15 in 1969–70. Lumley was also named First All-Star Team Goaltender in the 7th National Hockey League All-Star Game.\nIn 1956, Lumley was traded back to Chicago. He refused to play in Chicago and played the next year in the American Hockey League. He played with the Buffalo Bisons and the Providence Reds. Lumley would return to the National Hockey League in 1957 with the Boston Bruins. He played irregularly with them from 1957 to 1960 as he rotated his duties with Don Simmons. He would play one final season with the Winnipeg Warriors in the Western Hockey League.\nHe retired after the 1959–60 NHL season with 330 wins, 329 losses, 142 ties, and a 2.76 GAA. He was the first goaltender to have won 300 games and lost 300 games. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1980. After retiring, Lumley was a longtime co-owner of the successful Orangeville Raceway. He died on September 13, 1998, of a heart attack.\nLumley originated the tactic of making a pocket at shin level in goalie pads so pucks would drop straight on the ice instead of deflecting off them to an opponent.\nLegacy.\nThe community centre in his hometown of Owen Sound, where he continued to live after retiring, was renamed in his honour prior to his death. It is now officially known as the Harry Lumley Bayshore Community Centre. There is a trophy named after him that is awarded to the goalie with the best goals against in the Ontario Sr.A lacrosse league."

        "text": "Underwater rugby (UWR) is an underwater team sport. During a match two teams try to score a negatively buoyant ball (filled with saltwater) into the opponents’ goal at the bottom of a swimming pool. It originated from within the physical fitness training regime existing in German diving clubs during the early 1960s and has little in common with rugby football except for the name. It was recognised by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) in 1978 and was first played as a world championship in 1980.\nPlay.\nIt is played under water in a pool with a depth of 3.5 m to 5 m and goals (heavy metal buckets with a diameter of about 40 cm) at the bottom of the pool. Two teams (blue and white), each with six players (plus six substitutes), try to score a goal by sending the slightly negatively buoyant ball (filled with saltwater) into the opponents’ goal. It is a fast and exhausting game; therefore, the subs replace their players on the fly.\nThe ball may be passed in any direction but must not leave the water. It \"flies\" about 2 m or 3 m before water resistance stops it. This makes good tactics and good (three-dimensional) positioning essential. The players need all sorts of different abilities: strength, speed, agility or good teamplay are all similarly important.\nHistory.\nIn 1961 a member of the German Underwater Club (DUC) in Cologne, Ludwig von Bersuda, came up with the idea of an underwater ball game. Air-filled balls are not suitable for underwater games, as they are buoyant and always return to the surface. The first underwater ball was invented when Bersuda filled the ball with saltwater. Since the density of the ball was now greater than that of normal water, it no longer floated to the surface, but slowly sank to the bottom. The sink rate could, within certain limits, be controlled by the concentration of the salt solution. As footballs are too large to be practical, waterpolo balls are used.\nLudwig von Bersuda spanned the middle of the pool with a net, as in volleyball, that stopped 1 m above the pool bottom. Two teams played against each other: the offensive team had to carry the ball to the opposing field and put it into a bucket. The idea for the game was ready, and the DUC Cologne used it to warm up before normal training. Other teams saw this and started to use saltwater-filled balls themselves.\nThe \"Cologne Discipline\" was demonstrated as a competition sport at the national games in 1963, probably the first official game with an underwater ball. At the time, though, there was not much interest shown.\nDr. Franz Josef Grimmeisen, a member of the German Underwater Club in Duisburg, a city near Cologne, decided to make a competitive sport from this ball game. The German Lifeguard Association (DLRG) of Mülheim (since 1967 TSC Mülheim/Ruhr) had founded a divers' club, and through contact with members of DUC Duisburg learned of the game. With their help, Grimmeisen arranged the first underwater rugby game on Sunday October 4, 1964. It took place between DLRG Mülheim and DUC Duisburg. DUC Duisburg won the game 5–2. The next edition of the \"Essener Tageblatt\" carried the story.\nGrimmeisen kept promoting the ideas of an underwater rugby tournament to give the sport a character of serious competition. Together with the scuba-diving section of the DUC Mülheim/Ruhr, to which six players of DUC Duisburg came, he organized the first underwater rugby tournament rules, and the \"Battle for the Golden Ball\" in Hallenbad Sued, in Mülheim/Ruhr. The premiere was on November 5, 1965. Six clubs sent teams to Mülheim: DUC Bochum; DUC Düsseldorf, DUC Duisburg, DUC Essen and TSC Delphin Lüdenscheid. The rules of those days allowed 8-player teams, and DLRG Mülheim, the home team, came away winners, against DUC Duisburg (for whom Dr. Grimmeisen played).\nThe tournament has been held every year since then, which makes it the oldest tournament in the history of the sport. The Cologne version of the game was only played for a short time thereafter in Cologne, and has been long since forgotten. The Cologne team itself also turned to underwater rugby. To bring this game to the international arena, Grimmeisen turned to the two then most important members of CMAS, France and the USSR. He offered demonstration games and press coverage. Interest was not forthcoming. Just one French sport magazine, \"L'Equipe\", printed a short article in its April 9, 1965 edition.\nThe Scandinavian countries showed more interest, and adopted the ideas in relatively short time. A demonstration in Denmark in 1973 and in Finland in 1975 were effective. Games in Belgium in September 1973 and Vienna in 1979 were ineffective in generating interest. In the Eastern Bloc, only Czech teams were interested, and they, according to the politics of the time, played only against teams from other communist countries. The only tournament known to have taken place there is the Underwater Rugby Tournament in Prague, which has taken place every year since 1975 (with the exception of 1979). In later years, Polish teams participated as well, and teams from East Germany, who used the game for conditioning, sent observers.\nSince 1972, when the game was recognized as a sport by the Union of German Sport Divers (VDST), official German Championships have taken place. (An unofficial German Championship took place in 1971.) The first German Championship was held in Mülheim, and the first German Champions were TSC Mülheim.\nIn 1978, underwater rugby was officially recognized by CMAS, and from 28 to 30 April 1978, the first European Championships took place in Malmö, Sweden, and from 15 to 18 May 1980, the first World Championships in Mülheim.\nA different version of the current waterpolo became popular in the US, similar to underwater rugby, until US teams conformed to the international waterpolo rules around 2014.\nThe sport has little in common with rugby football except for the name.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body is the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques (CMAS) Underwater Rugby Commission. As of June 2013, the following countries and territories have affiliated with the commission: Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United States of America and Venezuela.\nInternational competition.\nMajor championships have been conducted at continental level within Europe for senior teams since 1978 and for junior teams since 1986. World championships have been conducted since 1980. A number of regional competitions are also conducted - these include the International Underwater Rugby Tournament and the Champions Cup in Europe and the North American Underwater Rugby Tournament in North America.\nEuropean Underwater Rugby League.\nIn the 1st season, four strongest clubs of Europe take part at European Underwater Rugby League: Swedish Malmo, Norwegian Molde, Danish Flipper and Russian Betta. The first winner of the European Underwater Rugby League, on the results of three rounds - became the Norwegian Molde. Competitions were held in three rounds, in Finland, Norway and Denmark.\nIn the 2nd season Swedish Polisen participated to Euroleague. Norwegian Molde was won European Underwater Rugby League the 2nd time. Competitions were held in three rounds, in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.\nIn the 3rd season Norwegian Akkaren and Austrian Wien participated to Euroleague. Norwegian Molde was won European Underwater Rugby League the 3rd time. Competitions were held in three rounds, in three European capitals: Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen.\nIn the 4th season Finish Tampere and Turkish EGE UWR Wien participated to Euroleague. Norwegian Molde was won European Underwater Rugby League the 4th time. Competitions were held in three rounds in Hameenlinna, Molde and Copenhagen.\nIn the 5th season Germans TSV Malsch participated to Euroleague. Also 3 more teams wanted to participate too, but the decision of League Managers was that 10 teams is maximum for 3 Rounds tournament. Norwegian Molde was won European Underwater Rugby League the 5th time. Competitions were held in three rounds, in Copenhagen, Vienna and Tampere.\nIn the 6th season Germans DUC Krefeld, Danish Tudserne, Norwegian Egersund UVK, Greek Fysalis participated to the 1st ever Qualification Round. Qualification Round were held at Copenhagen. Tudserne and DUC Krefeld took 1st and 2nd place and participated to the Main League. Competitions were held in three rounds, in Krefeld, Malmo and Izmir. Danish Tudserne won European Underwater Rugby League for the 1st time.\nIn the 7th season Finish Urheilusukeltajat participated to Euroleague. Norwegian Molde was won European Underwater Rugby League the 6th time. Competitions were held in three rounds, in Helsinki, Krefeld and Copenhagen.\nIn the 8th season Turkish EGE University participated to Euroleague. For the first time, the Euroleague round took place in Belgrade. The season was canceled due to the pandemic. \nHistory of creation. Written by co-Founder of Euroleague Anton Churzin in the year 2013.\nOn the creation of an underwater rugby tournament for the first time I thought in 2005, following my first major international tournament - the European Championships in Helsinki. Of course, I didn't think at the time that it would be called the Euroleague. Me and Viktor Krylov were 18 years old and we played in the team that lost all the games and hadn't scored any goals, so even if we had any master plan to create a new league we would not have anyone to listen, and moreover let us play in this league. Therefore, all was limited by our reasoning that the level of the major international competitions in underwater rugby is very low and this approach will never be able to bring the sport to a new level.\nAs time passed, our youth team has won three European Championships (2007,2008,2009) , essentially as the same team we played in adult tournaments.It is not difficult to guess that among youth teams our prestige was high, someone might not have liked us, but the reigning champion was respected. In 2008 for the first time we discussed the creation of underwater rugby league with Iver (Iver Bjornerem, in 2006 and 2007 captain of the youth team of Norway, the 2008 coach of Norway, the World Champion in 2011). He very positively perceived our ideas, and it was evident that the three of us think in the same direction. However, even Iver,who played at that point in the main squad of the national team of Norway, which is constantly fighting for first place in all competitions, hadn't an opportunity to promote our ideas.\nIn August 2010 died our friend, Captain of golden junior team in 2008 - Nikita Semenov. Thinking of rugby in that year was unbearable, but we found strength and in September held the first game of the Semenov Cup between the two best Russian teams Betta (Moscow) and Aquanavt (Tula). Drawing of the tournament ended on 12 December 2010. And here we realized that the Semenov Cup may not meet our most demanding dreams of an international league, but this is really the best of all international tournaments, which we visited. In 2011 began, perhaps, the real work on the League, but it was slow and perhaps even half-heartedly, because along the way we had to solve the problems of financing the club, the organization of the training process, and more. However, by November 2011, we had various options of the calendar, list of teams that we see in this tournament, and the name European Underwater Rugby League appeared just then. In general, everything was ready, except only the financial part, because we understood that if we make this tournament with prize money, no one would reject. But we decided to take the risk and submit a draft of our league to six teams that we've seen in this league. Molde (Norway) Malmo (Sweden) PI (Denmark) Bamberg (Germany) Hameenlinna (Finland). Sixth team was our - Betta. We did it on the Champions Cup on November 26, 2011. The moment was a success-we beat one of the leaders, and most importantly the potential participant of the Euroleague- Malmö and proceeded from the group of death into the semifinals. As a result, fourth place in the European Champions Cup and, perhaps, at the very moment we turned from the young and hopeful team in European eyes to the team claiming for medals. Although they may have not considered so.\nAnd then began the letters from the teams with questions and ideas, we went to the little trick saying Euroleague will surely be as Hameenlinna and Betta have already agreed to play. Deadline for application was May 2012. Swedes from Malmo were first to respond, in December 2011,and by the constructive questions that they asked, it became clear that the guys are serious. In January, the website euwrl.com was registered. By May, we received applications from Molde (Norway) Malmo (Sweden) Hameenlinna (Finland) and Betta. The calendar was ready and match dates and location of the rounds. As well as all the financial elements, the entry fee, payment for rent of the pools, video and more. Also was approved and started to work the management system of the Euroleague. It included four managers, one from each team, with equal rights. In June, we received a letter from the team Flipper (Denmark) to include them in the Euroleague. All 4 managers voted unanimously - agree. So in the Euroleague appeared the fifth team.\nEverything was going suspiciously well, honestly, presenting the league in November 2011, we never dreamed that in 2012 we hold the first round. And my fears that all is suspiciously well,came true. In late August, or a little more than a month before the start, the Finnish team refused to participate. All in all, anything can be played with 4 teams, not 5. But the first round was to be held right in Finland. Instead we tried to arrange a tour instead of the Finnish tour, in Copenhagen, but Flipper failed to negotiate the pool rent in such a short period of time. There was only one option to carry out the round in Finland, we have the benefit of 10 years of participation in the Finnish league and we were well acquainted with the country. But imposed another unpleasant moment of agreement- to pay the rent of water was the organizer of the home round. So now the Finnish round was home for Betta. We tried to rent the cheapest pool in Tampere, but he was busy on the desired date. In the end,we managed to negotiate only with the most expensive place - a swimming pool in Hameenlinna. All this took about 2 weeks and the rest of the teams were visibly nervous, the Norwegian team even proposed to postpone the launch until next year. But we were able to convince everyone that it is necessary to begin now.\nOn October 6, 2012 in the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna, we held the first ever round of the Euroleague, and on the side of the pool for all games stood the Semenov Cup - the main prize."

        "text": "The Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle was a shuttle service of the New York City Subway system that operated between Bowling Green and the inner loop platform at South Ferry. It operated to provide South Ferry service for IRT Lexington Avenue Line riders during hours when the 5 service did not stop at South Ferry (during the daytime on weekdays, and at first, also late nights). Because the inner loop station that the shuttle used at the South Ferry station was on such a tight curve, there was no continuous platform; instead four openings in the tunnel wall led into the station. Four R12 cars that were used on the shuttle, 5703–5706, which were modified and equipped so that only the center door of each car would open at one of the open spaces.\nHistory.\nThe shuttle was first operated in February 1909 to allow all rush hour trains to go to Brooklyn; the shuttle only operated during rush hours. Formerly, all Broadway express trains had terminated at South Ferry, with all Lenox Avenue express trains through to Brooklyn. Locals all ended at City Hall.\nFrom the line's opening until 1956, a small fleet of Deck Roof Hi-V cars were used on the shuttle, when they were replaced by a similarly small fleet of Standard Lo-V cars. These served the shuttle until August 1964, when they were subsequently replaced with the aforementioned R12 cars that had their door circuits modified so that only the doors which aligned with the portals would open.\nIn 1967, the Bowling Green–South Ferry shuttle and all others in the New York City Subway system was given the label .\nThe New York City Transit Authority decided that the shuttle was more trouble to operate than the benefit it provided. At midnight between February 12 and 13, 1977, the Bowling Green shuttle was discontinued without replacement; because of this, IRT Lexington Avenue Line passengers have had to walk a relatively short distance from Bowling Green station in order to access South Ferry and the Staten Island Ferry terminal.\nIn August 1989, the MTA proposed linking the Bowling Green platform to the Whitehall Street station of the BMT Broadway Line and the South Ferry station of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. The two latter stations were connected in 2009. Since 2007, there has been an entrance to the Bowling Green station in front of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (now the George Gustav Heye Center), just around the corner from two entrances to the Whitehall Street station (which are set into the building's eastern elevation)."

        "title": "Jay Wright (basketball)",
        "text": "Jerold Taylor \"Jay\" Wright Jr. (born December 24, 1961) is a former American college basketball coach. He served as the head coach of Villanova University from 2001 until 2022. Wright led the Villanova Wildcats to six Big East Conference championships and 16 NCAA tournament appearances in 21 seasons as head coach. Under Wright, Villanova reached four Final Fours (2009, 2016, 2018, 2022) and won two national championships in 2016 and 2018. \nBeginning as a four-year player at Bucknell University, he quickly moved to coaching as an assistant at the University of Rochester and then Drexel University. In 1987, Wright returned to the institution he grew up rooting for as an assistant at Villanova under Hall of Fame coach Rollie Massimino. He'd coach at Villanova for five years, before following Massimino for a stint as an assistant at UNLV.\nWright started his head coaching at Hofstra University (1994–2001), leading the program to NCAA tournament appearances in both 2000 and 2001. Wright was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the 2021 class.\nEducation.\nWright is a graduate of Council Rock High School North in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Bucknell University, in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1983, where he played on the basketball team and became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nUpon graduating from college, Wright got his first job as an assistant coach at Division III University of Rochester. In 1986, he got his first position in Division I college basketball as an assistant coach at Drexel University. His next job came as an assistant to Rollie Massimino at Villanova, where he remained from 1987 to 1992. In 1992, he moved with Massimino to UNLV, where he remained until 1994.\nHofstra (1994–2001).\nIn 1994, Wright was named head coach at Hofstra University, which had struggled through most of the 1980s and early '90s, with only one season of 20 or more wins since 1980, and no NCAA tournament appearances since 1977. Hofstra's athletic director Jim Garvey remarked that Wright was \"an outstanding recruiter,\" something the school was in need of improving. His hiring coincided with Hofstra's move to the North Atlantic Conference.\nHofstra went 10–18 in Wright's first season, finishing with the worst conference record in the NAC in the regular season, although they did secure a win over Maine in the conference tournament. Losing seasons followed for the next two years, with Hofstra going 9–18 and 12–15 respectively, although they did improve their finish in the conference each time – to 7th and 4th. Come the 1997–98 season, the Flying Dutchmen secured their first winning season for 12 years. With a roster featuring future NBA players Speedy Claxton and Norm Richardson, Hofstra defeated Hartford to reach the semi-finals of the now-renamed America East tournament, before losing to eventual tournament champions Delaware, to finish the year with a 19–12 record. Claxton was named the America East Conference Player of the Year, having finished first in the conference and seventh in the country for assists per game and led Hofstra in points per game.\nThe 1998–99 season saw a third-place finish in the conference, and another semi-final AEC tournament exit, this time at the hands of Drexel. But with Hofstra's first 20-win since 1991–92, they secured a bid to the 1999 National Invitation Tournament, the school's first ever appearance in the tournament, and their first postseason appearance in 22 years. The Dutchmen ultimately lost in the first round to Rutgers, 58–45. A first conference title arrived the following season – Hofstra both topped the regular season standings outright and won the conference tournament, after securing victories over Boston University, Drexel, and two-time defending champions Delaware. With the tournament victory, Hofstra secured a berth in the NCAA tournament, for the school's first appearance since 1977. Handed a 14th-seed, the Dutchmen were matched up against the 3rd-seed Oklahoma State Cowboys, who were ranked 14th in the nation in the AP Poll, but were unable to provide an upset, losing 86–66. Having broken the school record for victories in a season with 24, Wright earned AEC Coach of the Year honors. Claxton won his second conference Player of the Year award, having finished fourth in the nation in scoring, with 23.2 points per game.\nUnder Wright, the program slowly and steadily improved, and by 1999 the Pride were a premier team in the America East Conference. They won the conference championship in 2000 and 2001, and from 1999 to 2001, went 72–22, including two NCAA tournament appearances. Wright was named America East Coach of the Year in 1999–2000 and 2000–01. He was also tabbed Eastern Basketball's Coach of the Year in 1999–2000.\nWright took the Pride to the Postseason three times:\nVillanova (2001–2022).\nThree NIT appearances (2001–2004).\nAfter receiving overtures from Tennessee and Rutgers for their head coaching roles, Wright instead chose to return to Villanova, becoming the eighth coach in the 81-year history of the program. Wright inherited a mediocre team from previous coach Steve Lappas, and in Wright's first season, they made the NIT. In 2002, Wright was able to secure one of the top-rated recruiting classes in the country, led by McDonald's All-American center Jason Fraser. However, the Wildcats had a mediocre 2002–03 season, which was marred by a phone card abuse scandal that eventually resulted in suspensions to over half the roster. The Wildcats again made the NIT but did not advance far. The 2003–04 season saw more playing time for the talented young players from the previous recruiting class, but it also resulted in a mediocre season and another NIT appearance. Villanova advanced as far as the quarterfinals in the NIT, doing so in 2002 and 2004. Wright's NIT appearances in his first three years were considered by most fans to be failures and he entered his fourth year considered to be on the hottest seat in the Big East.\nSweet Sixteen and Elite Eight runs (2004–2008).\nIn the 2004–05 season, Wright's Wildcats enjoyed a breakout campaign thanks to the emergence of forward Curtis Sumpter and guards Allen Ray and Randy Foye. Villanova finished 22–7 in a year that included upset wins over No. 2 Kansas and No. 3 Boston College. They were rewarded with a fifth seed in the NCAA tournament, the Wildcats' first appearance in the tournament since 1999. Villanova defeated New Mexico and Florida to advance to the sweet 16. However, their tournament run came to an end next round after a narrow loss to North Carolina, the No. 1 seed (and eventual champion). Villanova was ranked 19th in the final Associated Press poll, their first such appearance in eight years.\nThe 2005–06 season saw the Wildcats ranked in the preseason top four of both major polls, thanks to the return of most players from the previous season. Led by seniors Allan Ray and Randy Foye, and an explosive sophomore in Kyle Lowry, the Wildcats lived up to the hype and finished with a 25–4 regular season record, including a 14–2 record in the Big East regular season, which tied them with University of Connecticut for first place in the conference.\nIn the 2006 NCAA tournament, Wright's experienced team earned a No. 1 seed for the first time in school history and posted victories over Monmouth in the first round and Arizona in the second. Wright's squad then narrowly edged Boston College to advance to the Elite 8 for the first time since 1988. However, the Wildcats run ended there, as they lost to eventual champion Florida. This marked the second consecutive year in which Wright's Wildcats were eliminated by the eventual national champion.\nFor his performance in the 2005–06 season, Wright received national coach of the year honors from CBS/Chevrolet; the Naismith Awards; and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC). He was also named the Big East Coach of the Year.\nThe 2006–07 squad had to replace three starters, but thanks in part to the healthy return of Curtis Sumpter, who had missed the previous season with an ACL injury, and McDonald's All-American Scottie Reynolds, the Wildcats made it back to the NCAA tournament for the third straight season. With a 22–10 record, they were seeded ninth but lost to Kentucky in the second round.\nIn the 2007 offseason, Wright once again came up with a highly rated recruiting class, this time led by McDonald's All-American Corey Stokes and Jordan Brand All-American Corey Fisher.\nThe 2007–08 season saw Villanova struggle at times, including a five-game losing streak in the middle of the season. Wright and the Wildcats were able to rebound to get a 12 seed (the final at-large seed) in the NCAA tournament. They upset fifth-seeded Clemson in round one, and beat Siena in round two to advance to their third Sweet 16 in four years. The team once again lost to the eventual champs, which this time was the Kansas Jayhawks.\nFinal Four appearance and upsets (2008–2012).\nThe 2008–09 team, led by senior Dante Cunningham, junior Scottie Reynolds and breakout sixth man Corey Fisher, streaked to a fourth-place finish in the Big East, and a double bye in the conference tournament. The third-seeded Wildcats overcame a double-digit halftime deficit to underdog American to avoid a first-round upset in the NCAA tournament. The team then defeated sixth-seeded UCLA by twenty points to make the program's fourth Sweet Sixteen in five years. In its Sweet Sixteen matchup against Duke, the Wildcats used timely perimeter defense to score a 23-point victory and a trip to the Elite Eight. In a back-and-forth Elite Eight game with then-conference rival Pitt, Reynolds came up big with a game-winning shot to put Villanova back in the Final Four for the first time since their national championship run in 1985. Villanova then fell to North Carolina, the eventual champions, in the National Semifinals at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan by a score of 83–69.\nFor the 2009–10 season, Wright brought in a recruiting class in the top five of the national rankings. The class was highlighted by point guard Maalik Wayns (Philadelphia/Roman Catholic), forwards Isaiah Armwood (Rockville, Md./Montrose Christian School) and Mouphtaou Yarou (Nattingou, Benin; also attending the same Montrose Christian School) and guard Dominic Cheek (Jersey City, NJ / St. Anthony's). Taylor King, a former McDonald's All-American and Duke transfer, also joined the rotation, after redshirting the '08–'09 season. The Wildcats earned a two seed in the NCAA tournament, but after a rocky start in the tournament, highlighted by Scottie Reynolds and Corey Fisher being benched to start the game, fell in the second round of play to Saint Mary's.\nThe Wildcats got off to a 16–1 start, and were ranked as high as sixth in the nation. However, they went 5–11 the rest of the way, including six straight losses to finish the season. The final two losses were particularly tough, as Villanova lost to South Florida in the Big East tournament before falling to George Mason in the Round of 64 in the NCAA tournament.\nFaced with a young team after the departures of seniors Corey Fisher and Corey Stokes, the Wildcats endured their worst season under Wright, finishing 13–19. To date, it's the only season in the Wright era where they have not competed in any postseason tournaments. They did manage a victory in the opening round of the Big East tournament, defeating Rutgers 70–49, before falling to South Florida for the second consecutive season.\nReturn to postseason and first national championship (2012–2016).\nVillanova's recent struggles prompted some to speculate that Wright's job was in danger. However, with the help of sophomores Darrun Hilliard and JayVaughn Pinkston, as well as freshmen Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu, the Wildcats returned to respectability, winning 20 games and returning to the NCAA Tournament. Though they fell to North Carolina in the Round of 64, the Wildcats picked up some signature wins, defeating #5 Louisville and #3 Syracuse in the span of a week. They also ended the regular season with wins over #17 Marquette and #5 Georgetown.\nIn the first season of the current Big East Conference, formed after Villanova and six other schools broke away from the original Big East Conference, Villanova was the #2 seed in the East and lost in the second round to Connecticut, the #7 seed and eventual national champion.\nIn the 2015 NCAA tournament, Villanova was the #1 seed in the East and lost in the second round to North Carolina State, the #8 seed.\nVillanova earned a #2 seed in the South Region of the 2016 NCAA tournament, defeating UNC Asheville, Iowa, Miami and Kansas to advance to the Final Four for the first time since 2009. In the national semifinal, Villanova defeated Oklahoma 95–51, the largest margin of victory in Final Four history. The Wildcats then proceeded to defeat North Carolina in the national title game, 77–74, on a 3-point shot by Kris Jenkins as time expired, earning Wright his first championship.\nIn addition to the record shattering 44-point defeat of Oklahoma in the Final Four, the 2016 championship run included numerous other notable achievements. Villanova was the first school without an FBS football program to win the NCAA men's title since Villanova's own championship in 1985. They were also the first team in 31 years (again, since the 1985 Villanova team) to dispatch four straight AP top 10 teams (Miami, Kansas, Oklahoma and North Carolina) in their run, and 5 total AP ranked teams (Iowa, in addition to the previously mentioned teams). They were also the only team, again since the 1985 Villanova championship squad, to beat four straight top 3 seeds on their championship run: two 1 seeds (Kansas and North Carolina), one 2 seed (Oklahoma) and one 3 seed (Miami). Villanova's performance included two of the most offensively efficient games ever recorded since the analytics era began in 2002, tallying 1.56 and 1.51 points per possession against 3-seed Miami and 2-seed Oklahoma, respectively. Villanova's average margin of victory for the tournament was nearly 21 points per game, and the only teams they defeated by less than 19 points were Kansas and North Carolina (the overall first and second seeded teams in the tournament, whom they beat by 5 and 3 points, respectively). It has been called perhaps the most dominant tournament championship run of all time, and the most dominant of the analytics era by a wide margin.\nSecond national championship (2016–2019).\nIn the 2017 NCAA tournament, Villanova was the #1 seed in the East and lost in the second round to Wisconsin, the #8 seed.\nShortly before the start of the 2017–18 season, Wright was named the recipient of the 2018 Legends of Coaching Award, part of the annual John R. Wooden Award program. Villanova earned a #1 seed in the East Region, defeating Radford, Alabama, West Virginia, and Texas Tech to advance to the Final Four for the second time in three years. In the National Semifinal, Villanova defeated Kansas 95–79. The Wildcats then proceeded to defeat Michigan in the National Championship Game, 79–62 to give Wright his second championship in three years. Assistant head coach Ashley Howard left Villanova on April 8, 2018, to become the head coach at La Salle University, a Philadelphia Big 5 rival.\nWright faced a difficult task after his second national title. Last year's departures included Mikal Bridges, Donte DiVincenzo, Omari Spellman, and Jalen Brunson, who were each taken in the 2018 NBA draft. As a result, Wright was left with a young, inexperienced squad entering the season. Villanova stood at #8 in the preseason rankings, but they were crushed by Michigan in a title game rematch in their third game of the season. They later fell to Furman in overtime at home, dropping them from the Top 25 entirely. After losing to top-ranked Kansas in December, Villanova won 11 in a row and returned to the national rankings. A February win over #10 Marquette allowed them to clinch the Big East regular season title. They would then go on to defeat Providence, Xavier, and Seton Hall to win their third consecutive Big East tournament, becoming the first team to do so. Wright earned his sixth Big East Coach of the Year Award for his efforts. The Wildcats finished 26–10 and earned a sixth seed in the NCAA Tournament. They would defeat 11th-seeded St. Mary's in the Round of 64 by 4, before falling to Purdue 87–61.\nFinal Four run and retirement (2019–2022).\nThe Wildcats ended their season with a 24–7 record. Villanova's 13–5 record in Big East play allowed them to clinch a share of the conference's regular season title, tying with Creighton and Seton Hall. The Wildcats were seeded second in the Big East tournament, but the tournament was cancelled early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Oddly, the Big East tournament was the last conference tournament to be cancelled, which resulted in games being played despite other conferences canceling their games.\nDespite losing sophomore Saddiq Bey to the first round of the NBA draft, Wright and the Wildcats were ranked third in the opening AP poll to start the season. Villanova got off to an 8–1 start (which included wins over No. 18 Arizona State and No. 17 Texas) but was forced to temporarily shut down when Wright and several other members of the program tested positive for COVID-19. With an 11–4 conference record, the Wildcats clinched at least a share of the regular season title for the third consecutive season, clinching it with a win over Creighton on March 3. However, Villanova was ousted in the quarterfinal round of the conference tournament in an upset loss to eventual champion Georgetown after losing co-Big East Player of the Year Collin Gillespie (sharing with teammate Jeremiah Robinson-Earl and Sandro Mamukelashvili of Seton Hall) to an injury. Many felt that, without Gillespie, the Wildcats would be subjected to a quick exit at the NCAA Tournament, where they were seeded fifth in the South region. Villanova instead topped twelfth-ranked Winthrop and thirteenth-ranked North Texas to return to the Sweet 16 before losing to Baylor 62–51.\nRanked fourth in the initial Associated Press poll, the Wildcats stumbled to a 7–4 start. Villanova had fallen to 23rd in the rankings by late December before going 19–3 over the rest of the regular season. The Big East's regular-season championship went to Providence, whose .824 winning percentage beat Villanova's at .800. Wright earned his fifth Big East tournament title and second-seeded Villanova's sixth overall as they topped Creighton in the championship round. Gillespie was named the conference tournament MVP after earning Big East Player of the Year honors. For their efforts, the Wildcats were granted a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they topped #15 Delaware, #7 Ohio State, #11 Michigan, and #5 Houston to advance to the Final Four, before losing 81–65 to eventual champion Kansas. He retired following the season, with former assistant Kyle Neptune succeeding him as head coach.\nCoaching tree.\nAssistant coaches under Wright who became NCAA or NBA head coaches\nInternational coaching career.\nWright has coached, as a head coach or assistant coach, basketball teams representing the United States three times in international competitions. He led Team USA to a gold medal at the 2005 World University Games as head coach, and was an assistant coach in the 2000 World Championship for Young Men Qualifying Tournament. Wright coached the American team in the 2007 Pan Am Games to a fifth-place finish, with a 3–2 record.\nPersonal life.\nWright is married to his wife Patricia, with three children.\nWright is a two-time winner of The Runway to the Fashionable Four, an award given by Tim Capstraw to the best-dressed coach in college basketball from 1998 until 2002.\nWright joined CBS/Turner Sports as a college basketball analyst following his retirement from coaching."

        "title": "Century (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings by a batter. The term is also included in \"century partnership\" which occurs when two batsmen add 100 runs to the team total when they are batting together. A century is regarded as a landmark score for batters and a player's number of centuries is generally recorded in their career statistics. Scoring a century is loosely equivalent in merit to a bowler taking a five-wicket haul, and is commonly referred to as a ton or hundred. Scores of more than 200 runs are still statistically counted as a century, although these scores are referred to as double (200–299 runs), triple (300–399 runs), and quadruple centuries (400–499 runs), and so on. Reaching 50 runs in an innings is known as a half-century. \nScoring a century at Lord's earns the batter a place on the Lord's honours boards.\nEarliest known centuries.\nCenturies were uncommon until the late 19th century because of the difficulties in batting on pitches that had only rudimentary preparation and were fully exposed to the elements. There is doubt about the earliest known century, but the most definite claim belongs to John Minshull who scored 107 for the Duke of Dorset's XI v Wrotham at Sevenoaks Vine on 31 August 1769. This \nwas a minor match.\nThe first definite century in a top-class match was scored by John Small when he made 136 for Hampshire v Surrey at Broadhalfpenny Down in July 1775. The earliest known century partnership was recorded in 1767 between two Hambledon batsmen who added 192 for the first wicket against Caterham. It is believed they were Tom Sueter and Edward \"Curry\" Aburrow.\nWhen Hambledon played Kent at Broadhalfpenny in August 1768, the \"Reading Mercury\" reported: \"what is very remarkable, one Mr Small, of Petersfield, fetched above seven score notches off his own bat\". Unfortunately it is not known if Small did this in one innings or if it was his match total. Hambledon batsmen Tom Sueter and George Leer are the first two players definitely known to have shared a century partnership when they made 128 for the first wicket against Surrey at Broadhalfpenny Down in September 1769.\nHighest number of centuries.\nFirst-class cricket.\nW. G. Grace was the first batsman to score 100 career centuries in first-class cricket, reaching the milestone in 1895. His career total of 124 centuries was subsequently passed by Jack Hobbs, whose total of 199 first-class centuries is the current record.\nTest cricket.\nThe first century in Test cricket was scored by Charles Bannerman who scored 165 before retiring hurt, in the first ever Test between Australia and England, played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from 15 to 19 March 1877. The first century partnership in Test cricket was between W. G. Grace and A. P. Lucas, batting for England, in the first innings of the only Test match between England and Australia on the Australians' 1880 tour of England, played at the Kennington Oval (6–8 September 1880).\nThe current holder of the record for most centuries in Test cricket is Sachin Tendulkar of India, who has scored 51 centuries.\nOne Day International cricket.\nThe first One Day International (ODI) century was scored by Denis Amiss, who amassed 103 runs against Australia at Old Trafford in 1972 (the second official ODI on record). Currently, Virat Kohli hold the record by scoring 50 ODI centuries, followed by Sachin Tendulkar with 49 centuries, followed by Rohit Sharma of India with 31 centuries and Ricky Ponting of Australia with 30 centuries.\nTwenty20 International cricket.\nThe first Twenty20 International (T20I) century was scored by Chris Gayle who amassed 117 runs against South Africa at Johannesburg in the very first match of ICC World Twenty20 tournament in 2007. Rohit Sharma currently holds the record for most T20I centuries, having scored 5 T20I Centuries.\nFastest centuries.\nThe fastest recorded century in Test cricket in terms of balls faced is held by Brendon McCullum, who scored 100 runs from 54 balls against Australia in 2016 at Christchurch, New Zealand, in his final test, beating the previous record of 56 held jointly by Viv Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq. The record for the fastest century in first-class cricket in terms of time taken, in genuine match conditions rather than in contrived circumstances with deliberately weak bowling, is held by Percy Fender, who scored 100 in 35 minutes for Surrey against Northamptonshire in a County Championship match in 1920. The record for the fastest recorded century in terms of balls faced in first-class cricket is held by David Hookes, who scored 102 runs from 34 balls for South Australia vs. Victoria in a Sheffield Shield match in 1982. Chris Gayle holds the record for the fastest century in Twenty20, during an Indian Premier League in April 2013, reaching the milestone off only 30 balls.\nIn One day International cricket (ODI), the fastest century is held by South African batsman AB De Villiers. De Villiers' century came up in just 31 balls against the West Indies in the 2nd ODI at Johannesburg on 18 January 2015. De Villiers' hundred included 8 fours and 16 sixes. Corey Anderson (New Zealand) is second, scoring a 36-ball century against West Indies in Queenstown on 1 January 2014. Shahid Afridi (Pakistan) is third. with his 37-ball century against Sri Lanka being scored in Nairobi on 4 October 1996.\nDavid Miller of South Africa hit the fastest century in Twenty20 international cricket against Bangladesh on 29 October 2017. Miller brought up his century in just 35 balls. Rohit Sharma of India equalled the record of the fastest century in T20 international cricket against Sri Lanka on 22 December 2017. Czech Republic's Sudesh Wickramasekara reached the three-figure mark in 35 balls against Turkey on 30 August 2019, equalling Rohit Sharma's and David Miller's joint-fastest T20I hundred.\nOn 22 April 2019, Scottish cricketer George Munsey scored 100 in 25 balls playing for Gloucestershire 2nd XI; his 39-ball total of 147 included 20 sixes."

        "title": "Boom (sailing)",
        "text": "In sailing, a boom is a spar (pole), along the of a fore and aft rigged sail, that greatly improves control of the angle and shape of the sail. The primary action of the boom is to keep the \"foot\" flatter when the sail angle is away from the centerline of the boat. The boom also serves as an attachment point for more sophisticated control lines. Because of the improved sail control it is rare to find a non-headsail without a boom, but lateen sails, for instance, are loose-footed. In some modern applications, the sail is rolled up into the boom for storage or reefing (shortening sail).\nBoom attachment.\nThe forward end of the boom attaches to a mast just below the sail, with a joint called the gooseneck. The gooseneck pivots allowing the other end of the boom to move freely. The clew (back corner) of the sail attaches to the free end of the boom. The entire \"foot\" of the sail may be attached to the boom or just the clew. If the \"foot\" is not attached to the boom, the rig is known as loose footed.\nA boom may be found on small headsails. There the forward end of the boom is attached to the same stay as the sail's luff (forward edge).\nLines on the boom.\nThe control lines (ropes) on the boom act in conjunction with the halyard and leech line to ensure that the sail is trimmed most effectively.\nTwo primary sail control lines are attached to every boom:\nA boom will frequently have these additional sail control lines attached:\nOther lines that may be found on a boom include:\nBoom material and hardware.\nTraditionally booms, and other spars, were made of wood. Classic wooden hulled sailboats, both old and new, will usually have wooden spars. When aluminium became available, it was adopted for sailboat spars. Aluminium spars are lighter and stronger than their wooden counterpart, require less maintenance and generally hold up better to marine conditions. Aluminium spars are usually associated with fibreglass boats, although one can still find a few early fibreglass hulled yachts that were equipped with wooden spars. On very large sailing vessels, the spars may be steel. Modern, high performance, racing yachts may have spars constructed of more expensive materials, such as carbon fibre.\nVarious hardware is found attached to the boom. The hardware could include fairleads, blocks, block tracks, and cleats. For attachment, screws are used on wooden booms and screws or rivets on aluminium booms. If the foot of the sail is attached to the boom, there may be hoops from the foot of the sail, around the boom, or there may be a track on the top of the boom into which fittings on the foot of the sail are slid.\nIn-boom furling.\nThere are quite a few variations of in-boom furling available. Generally the boom is hollow with a spindle in the center upon which the sail is rolled (furled). The techniques for turning the spindle vary, but frequently a line is used to spin the spindle and recover or reef the sail. In most cases the sail can be full battened and has virtually infinite reefing options. Some sailors consider this approach safer than in-mast furling, since the sail can be lowered and flaked in the traditional method, in the case of mechanical failure. In most applications, the sail can be lowered or reefed from the cockpit. Most designs will not accommodate a loose-footed mainsail.\nBoom safety concerns.\nThe second leading cause of death on sailboats is directly attributed to the use of booms. Booms can cause injuries directly, sweep people overboard, and their associated hardware and lines represent tripping hazards. On larger boats, sailors tend to stand on the boom to perform sail maintenance and install or take off sail covers. Falls from the boom onto the deck below occur. Even when stationary, booms represent a hazard since on most boats there is insufficient headroom to walk below them without ducking. According to a German study, \"boom strikes were the most common cause of sailing injury overall\".\nWhen boom injuries occur far from shore they can require expensive rescues. In 2010 the US Coast Guard and Air National Guard utilized a Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft to rescue a man from 1400 miles off the Mexican coast. Deaths and injuries can occur on boats operating upon lakes and coastal waters.\nAs a precaution, any sailboat with a low boom should mandate use of life jackets, and ensure others know how to obtain assistance and operate the craft. In Boston a sailor knocked overboard by the boom died in full sight of the land and other boats and the person left aboard didn't know how to use the radio.\nNew boat designs to lower boom risks.\nTo address the dangers associated with the boom, some designers have raised the boom higher off the deck or applied padding. However, these raise the center of gravity and increase the chances of capsizing and turtling.\nSome designers have addressed the issue by eliminating the boom completely. Classic types of sail like the square rig or the standing lugsail have always worked without booms. Modern alternatives without a boom are the mast aft rig.\nOther boom uses.\nOn an open cockpit sailboat at a mooring, a tarpaulin may be run over the boom and tied to the rails to form a tent over the cockpit.\nIn certain situations on larger boats, the boom can be used as a crane to help lift aboard heavy items like a dinghy.\nOther boom types.\nFlexible boom.\nWhen the foot of a sail is attached along its whole length to a boom, the stiffness of the boom tends to hold the lower part of the sail flat. However, the greatest aerodynamic efficiency of the sail is created when the sail is allowed to curve into an airfoil-like shape. A flexible boom bends with the sail to create this greater efficiency.\nPark Avenue boom.\nA \"Park Avenue\" boom allows for the same aerodynamic curvature as a flexible boom, but is a rigid construction with a flat surface on top. Instead of being fastened directly to the boom, the foot of the sail is fastened to fittings that slot into grooves that run transversely across the boom. As these fittings move within their grooves, the foot of the sail is free to curve. It takes its name from the great width of such a boom fitted to the yacht \"Enterprise\" for the 1930 America's Cup competition, a hyperbolic comparison to the width of Park Avenue."

        "text": "David Andrew Taylor (born December 4, 1955) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Los Angeles Kings from 1977 to 1994. He featured in the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals with the Kings.\nFollowing his playing career, he served as the Kings' general manager from 1997 to 2006, and currently serves as Vice-president of Hockey Operations with the NHL's St. Louis Blues.\nEarly life.\nTaylor was born and raised in Levack, Ontario, a mining town located 45 km northwest of Sudbury, Ontario. He began playing minor hockey in Levack and became a young prodigy in the small town. In his teens, he attended his local Levack High School while also working in the mine in his hometown.\nJunior and college career.\nTaylor found himself playing Junior A for his hometown Onaping Falls Huskies of the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League in 1973 where he recorded 67 goals and 76 assist to total 143 points in 45 games.\nAfter one season with Onaping Falls with him graduating from high school. Taylor played three seasons of college hockey at Clarkson University, where he still holds the school record for career points (251) goals (98) and assists (153) as well as single season goals (41) assists (67) and points (108) in the 1976-77 campaign where he led all of NCAA that year and won the ECAC Hockey player of the year award. in comparison, opposing teams scored a combined 127 goals on Clarkson that year.\nTaylor also played 7 games with the Fort Worth Texans of the Central Hockey League during the 1976–77 season putting up 2 goals and 4 assists for 6 points.\nNHL career.\nTaylor was selected 210th overall in the 15th round of the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft and was also selected 113th overall in the 9th round of the 1975 WHA Amateur Draft. His first NHL season was the 1977–78 season where he played 64 of 80 games and recorded 22 goals and 21 assists to total 43 points. In the next season of 1978–79, he improved to one of the leagues top scorers recording 43 goals and 48 assists to total 91 points.\nTaylor was a member of the famous Triple Crown Line along with hall of fame centre Marcel Dionne and left winger Charlie Simmer. In the 1980–81 season all three scored more than 100 points with the Kings with Dionne and Simmer scoring 135 and 105 points, respectively and Taylor scoring 112 points to record the best season of his career.\nTaylor became captain of the Kings in 1985 after the departure of preceding captain Terry Ruskowski. He held the position until 1989 when it was overtaken by Wayne Gretzky. He would then serve as an alternate captain for the rest of his career.\nIn 1991, Taylor won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for his dedication towards the Los Angeles Kings. He also won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his involvement in charity work and for helping others overcome speech impediments.\nIn 1993, with his production rapidly deteriorating, Taylor and the Los Angeles Kings made the Stanley Cup Finals with him producing 3 goals and 5 assists for 8 points in 22 playoff games. The Kings lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the final in 5 games.\nTaylor retired in 1994 as he was becoming less active in the NHL and his points were starting to decline. Until 2019, he held the Kings record for games played with 1,111 until it was broken by Dustin Brown and then Anže Kopitar. He is the lowest-drafted player to net 1,000 career points, drafted in the 15th round (210th overall) of the 1975 NHL draft and has appeared in four NHL All-Star Games in 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1994. The Los Angeles Kings have retired #18 in his honor.\nInternational career.\nTaylor represented Canada in the Ice Hockey World Championships in 1983, 1985 and 1986. During those tournaments, he recorded 7 goals and 10 assists for 17 points in 30 games. Canada won bronze in 1983 and 1986 and also won a silver in 1985.\nFront office.\nTaylor was hired as the General Manager of the Los Angeles Kings in 1997 and held the position until 2006, when a front office reshuffling saw him assume the position of Director of Amateur Development. He also drafted future Kings superstars which include Anže Kopitar, Dustin Brown and Jonathan Quick. With a record of 290-261-74-31, Taylor was the winningest GM in Kings’ history. He later moved to the Dallas Stars and served as the team's Director of Player Personnel for three seasons.\nTaylor was hired by the St. Louis Blues on July 1, 2010, as Vice-president of Hockey Operations. He won the Stanley Cup with the Blues in 2019 and returned to his hometown of Levack with the cup.\nPersonal.\nBecause of his success, Taylor is considered a hero in his hometown of Levack and the arena there features a lot of dedication to him.\nTaylor has dealt with stuttering since childhood. The speech disorder once forced him to drop a college class when he discovered that an oral presentation would be required. When interviewed after games early in his professional hockey career, Taylor would attempt to conceal his stuttering by faking hyperventilation as a means of providing him with fluency. Taylor credits Los Angeles–based Speech-Language Pathologist Vivian Sheehan for assisting him in his triumph over stuttering.\nTaylor and his wife Beth currently reside near Los Angeles with their two daughters, Jamie and Katie.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "WWF WrestleMania 2000 (video game)",
        "text": "WWF WrestleMania 2000 is a professional wrestling video game released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 (N64) console. It was based on the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF, now WWE) annual pay-per-view, WrestleMania. Despite the fact that this game is based upon WrestleMania 2000, the game was released five months prior (and four months prior on the Game Boy Color) to the actual PPV itself, therefore resulting in the game using the stage design from the 1999 event, WrestleMania XV, instead. Released at the height of the WWF's Attitude Era, \"WrestleMania 2000\" was the first WWF game released by THQ. The wrestling company ended its long relationship with Acclaim Entertainment after witnessing the video game success of its competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), on behalf of THQ. \"WrestleMania 2000\" shares its game engine with the Japan-only release \"\".\nThe game would be succeeded by \"WWF No Mercy\" in 2000.\nGameplay.\n\"WWF WrestleMania 2000\" uses the exact same game engine previously seen in \"WCW/nWo Revenge,\" which released the previous year. More than 50 WWF wrestlers were included in the game, and, with the exception of existing superstars' move sets, all of them can be freely edited to the player's liking. Using the same system, the Create-a-Wrestler mode is extensive. Players are able to create a highly detailed wrestler with an extensive library of wrestling moves, many of which are carried over from previous AKI games in the series. Usual WWF modes such as Royal Rumble and King of the Ring modes are included, along with a pay-per-view mode, enabling the player to either recreate or create unique pay-per-views with television-style features. Players can also create up to eight championship belts and put them up for contest in Exhibition mode.\nThe \"Road To WrestleMania\" mode places the player on the long road to WWF glory. Starting out as a rookie, the player gradually works their way up the ladder and earns opportunities to gain various WWF titles, win various tournaments, be challenged by various wrestlers and ultimately main-event at WrestleMania 2000. Although the story mode is long and extensive in the number of matches in which it pits the player, there are no branching storylines and if the player loses a match, it is simply recorded as a loss in their win–loss record. Throughout the mode, when the player wins a championship, they are expected to defend their title in future in-game pay-per-view events. This rule applies to all championships that the player currently holds. For example, if one holds the WWF European Championship, WWF Intercontinental Championship, WWF Tag Team Championship, and the WWF Championship, the player must defend all four titles during one single pay-per-view event.\nThere are often feuds at different parts in the storyline, occasionally with one wrestler calling out another wrestler in the ring. Also, feuding wrestlers often interrupt matches, helping the opponent. However, the season continues whether or not the player wins or loses their matches. If the player progresses through a winning season with a created wrestler and then starts a new season as a new created wrestler, the first character will still be used in season mode.\nFeatures.\nThe game features several arenas at which WWF held events in 1998 and 1999. There are also arenas based on each WWF television show, such as \"Sunday Night Heat\", \"Raw is War\", as well as other pay-per-view venues of the time.\nThis was the first WWF game to allow players to freely edit their favorite superstars (i.e. putting Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Rock's trunks) and also be able to create and modify alternate attires for each wrestler, as each character in the game has four templates that can be individually edited and switched between using the left and right 'C' buttons. If the player makes changes that they do not like, a default button resets the edited costume into the original costume for that slot. It was also the first THQ produced Nintendo 64 title to feature a \"Create a Wrestler\" mode.\nIn addition to the numerous default and secret characters, several other realistic likenesses and movesets in the create-a-wrestler mode make it possible to add even more characters. Some examples include The Road Warriors, Hulk Hogan, Taka Michinoku, and Davey Boy Smith. Also, some taunts and move sets were carried over from \"WCW/nWo Revenge\", allowing the player to create and include WCW wrestlers such as Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Diamond Dallas Page, and Macho Man Randy Savage. The drawback to the create-a-wrestler mode, however, is the fact that there are limited slots available due to limited memory space, but players can edit the individual templates in the character models to include four different characters with separate appearances which allows a great deal of flexibility. However, wrestlers in the same template are forced to have the same moves.\nAdditionally, by making two superstars' entrance music the same, if they are a real-life tag team they will be introduced as such; for instance, matching the Road Dogg and Mr. Ass's themes would lead to them being introduced together as The New Age Outlaws before a tag team match.\nAlso, some features are implemented in the game that were not seen in \"WCW/nWo Revenge\", such as a Cage Match and a First Blood mode. Reversals and counter moves were also expanded upon and made much more commonplace.\nA normally unselectable Computer Intelligence mode can also be accessed using a GameShark code, as well as WCW and nWo ring aprons.\nThis game's roster is notable compared to both the preceding \"WWF Attitude\" and its successor \"WWF SmackDown!\". It is the only THQ WWF game where Droz, Chaz (Mosh), Thrasher and Jeff Jarrett are playable, due to Droz suffering a career-ending injury and the remaining names leaving the company the same year. It is also the only game in which where Scott Taylor and Brian Christopher are featured in their earlier \"Too Much\" gimmick, as well as the only game where Shawn Stasiak's short-lived gimmick as \"Meat\" is playable (he would soon after leave for WCW and return to the company following the company's purchase in 2001). It is one of only two games in which Michael Hayes is playable (the other being \"WCW Wrestling\" from a decade prior). In addition, one of The Godfather's Hos is a playable character despite not being a wrestler.\nSignature taunts.\nIn \"WWF WrestleMania 2000\", many players have their signature taunts, such as Stone Cold Steve Austin flipping off an opponent or Mr. Ass mooning another wrestler. Also, by pressing in a different direction on the joystick, a different taunt is performed. Rotating the joystick counter clock wise results in the player mimicking his opponent's taunt.\nRoster.\nUnlockables.\nAll characters are unlocked by playing the \"Road to WrestleMania\" mode:\nAdvertising and release.\nIn a TV commercial promoting the game, The Rock becomes furious at how the game includes his name, likeness, and move-set. At the end of the ad, he threatens to shove copies of the game up Santa Claus's \"candy-ass\".\nSome copies of \"WWF WrestleMania 2000\" shipped with a special card containing four holograms of the in game action, such as a wrestler's entrance or finishing move.\nReception.\nThe N64 version of the game received \"favorable\" reviews, while the Game Boy Color version received \"mixed\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. Daniel Erickson of \"NextGen\" said of the former console version: \"Wonderful gameplay even overshadows the lack of quality audio.\" Stuart Clarke of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" said of the same console version: \"The strong gameplay will even appeal to non-wrestling fans and with up to four people able to fight simultaneously it's sure to be a popular party game.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the same console version a score of 28 out of 40.\nIn one \"GamePro\" review, The Enforcer called the Nintendo 64 version \"the best wrestling title this year. [...] The king of the ring has arrived.\" In another review, The D-Pad Destroyer called it \"a very fun game, especially for four players, and its ease of play will endear it to hardcore wrestling fans who don't want to spend months studying a list of moves. It may be new, and it may have the WWF, but in the end, it's just the revenge of \"Revenge\".\"\nIn the final edition of \"Nintendo Power\", \"WWF WrestleMania 2000\" was ranked number 223 in a list of the best games released on Nintendo consoles, namely for its massive roster and positive gameplay ability. The game sold more than one million units by January 2000.\nDuring the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Nintendo 64 version was a finalist for the \"Console Fighting Game of the Year\" award, which was ultimately given to \"Soulcalibur\"."

        "title": "Glenn Davis (baseball)",
        "text": "Glenn Earl Davis (born March 28, 1961) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman who played for the Houston Astros and Baltimore Orioles from 1984 to 1993 and finished in the top ten in National League MVP balloting three times (, and ).\nEarly life.\nDavis' parents divorced when he was six years old. While attending University Christian School in Jacksonville, Florida, the school's athletic director, George Davis, took an interest in Glenn. While they are not related to Glenn, he and his wife, Norma, practically adopted him, and they are the biological parents of former major league pitcher Storm Davis. Though they are not related, Glenn and Storm have long considered themselves brothers.\nAt University Christian, Glenn and Storm led the Christians to back-to-back state titles (1978–79).\nBoth were drafted in the 1979 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles upon graduation from University Christian High School (Storm seventh round, Glenn 31st). While Storm chose to sign with the Orioles, Glenn accepted a baseball scholarship and played one season at the University of Georgia and then transferred to Manatee Junior College to make himself eligible sooner for the MLB draft. In 1980, Davis played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) where he was named a league all-star. He was named to the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2023. The Houston Astros selected Davis in the first round of the draft's secondary phase in 1981 and signed him for $50,000.\nHouston Astros.\nDavis developed into one of the top power-hitting prospects in the Astros' farm system, hitting 71 home runs before receiving his first call up to the majors in September . In his first full season, , Davis batted .271 with 20 home runs and 64 runs batted in to finish fifth in National League rookie of the year balloting. In Houston, he earned his nickname, \"The Big Bopper\".\nDavis had a break-out season in 1986. He had 60 RBIs and 20 home runs at the All-Star break to make his first All-Star team. For the season, he clubbed 31 home runs and had 101 RBIs with a .265 batting average to win the Silver Slugger Award at first base, and finish second to the Philadelphia Phillies' Mike Schmidt in NL MVP voting.\nThe Astros handily won the National League West by ten games over the Cincinnati Reds to face the New York Mets in the 1986 National League Championship Series. The only scoring in the game one pitchers' duel between Mike Scott and Dwight Gooden was a solo home run by Davis in the second inning, which he hit in his first ever postseason at-bat. From there, Mets pitching would contain Davis until the classic game six extra-innings marathon. Davis went three-for-seven with a run scored and two RBIs, including the final run of the game as the Astros attempted to come back from a 7–4 deficit in the 16th inning, although they would wind up losing the game and series. It would be his only postseason experience, and he had seven total hits in the series.\nDavis remained one of the top sluggers in the NL through 1989, earning a second All-Star selection in 1989, and finishing in the top ten in MVP voting in 1988 and 1989. In the 1990 season opener, Cincinnati Reds pitchers hit Davis with pitches in three of his six plate appearances. He hit three home runs in a loss to the San Francisco Giants on June 1. However, a rib injury caused Davis to miss the entire month of July and limited him to just 93 games all season. Despite his limited time on the field, Davis still managed to put up respectable numbers, hitting 22 home runs and driving in 64. In 1989, he became the first Astro to hit at least 20 home runs in five consecutive seasons. Davis still ranks fifth all-time in Astros career home run leaders.\nIn the offseason, he was part of what many consider to be the worst trade in Baltimore Orioles history when he was traded to the Orioles for three future All-Stars, Steve Finley, Pete Harnisch and Curt Schilling. After the trade Davis signed a then club record $3.275 million, one-year contract with the Orioles.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nDavis suffered a nerve injury in his neck during his first spring training with the Orioles on a swing that he felt two pops in immediately. He tried to play through the injury, which resulted in neck spasms on his right side. The injury he was found to have suffered was damage to his spinal accessory nerve. He was batting .244 with four home runs and eight RBIs through April 24, 1991 when this injury landed him on the disabled list, and kept him from the Orioles' line-up through the middle of August. Upon his return, he never regained his power hitting form, and ended the season with 10 home runs, 28 RBIs and a .227 average in 49 games. In 1992, Davis had a decent but unspectacular season for the Orioles, with a .276 batting average, 13 home runs, and 48 RBIs in 106 games.\nThe 1993 season was a disaster for Davis. Splitting time fairly evenly between first base and designated hitter, Davis was batting just .177 with one home run and nine RBIs through May when his jaw was broken in a bar fight. After a brief stint with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings, Davis's return to action was delayed when, while he was sitting in the dugout during an Orioles game on August 1, he was hit in the head by a line drive foul ball of the bat of teammate Jeffrey Hammonds. He was finally reactivated on September 6, but, following an argument with Orioles manager Johnny Oates about being left out of the starting line-up against left-handed pitcher Dave Fleming, was released by the club two days later on September 8 without playing another game. Glenn Davis holds the record of most home runs in career history (190) without ever hitting a grand slam.\nLater career.\nDavis joined the New York Mets for spring training 1994, but did not make the club. He later joined the Omaha Royals and, despite a very solid season in which he produced a batting average of .282 with 27 home runs and 97 RBI, he was not given another opportunity to play in the Majors. From 1995 to 1996 Davis played for the Hanshin Tigers in Japan. He came back to the US and spent the end of the 1996 season playing for St. Paul Saints in the Northern League before retiring from baseball.\nPersonal life.\nDavis is married to Teresa Beesley Davis from Columbus, Georgia. The couple has three daughters: Sharayah, Tiffany, and Gabrielle. Davis is the CEO of the Cascade Group, which develops hotels in the southeast region of the country.\nIn 1992, Davis founded The Carpenter's Way home for disadvantaged children in Columbus, Georgia, and in 2008 he and his wife helped start the Arebella Home for girls. He currently serves as an elected city councilman for the city of Columbus and owns the Hilton Garden Inn and Homewood Suites hotels located in Columbus, Georgia."

        "text": "Joseph R. Brennan (November 15, 1900 – May 10, 1989) was an American professional basketball player. He is mostly known for his time with the Brooklyn Visitations, which he joined in 1919 and led to three ABL championships (1929, 1931 and 1935). After his playing career, he coached St. Francis College in Brooklyn for 7 seasons from 1941 to 1948. He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975.\nBiography.\nJoseph R. Brennan was born in Brooklyn on November 15, 1900. He attended High School at St. Augustine Academy and played basketball there for four years. When he graduated in 1919, he went directly to a professional basketball team: the all-Irish Brooklyn Visitations. At the time it was prevalent for players to compete on several teams in different leagues during the same season. As such, during Brennan's 19-year career he also played for Troy, New York of the New York State League, Holyoke, Massachusetts of the Massachusetts League, Philadelphia and Wilkes-Barre both of the Eastern League, and for the Brooklyn Jewels, the Brooklyn Whirlwinds and the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Brooklyn Visitations began in the Metropolitan League but later moved to the ABL. With the Visitations, Brennan won three ABL championships.\nIn 1936 he retired from professional basketball and began a college basketball coaching career with St. Francis College. It is also worth noting that Brennan during the 1920s and up until 1961 was an employee at Emigrant Savings Bank. This at times prevented him from playing in road games when he was an active basketball player during the 1920s and 30s. In 1961, when Brennan left Emigrant Savings Bank he was the vice-president and went on to become the president of Atlantic Savings and Loans Association of Brooklyn. He held that post until 1968 when he retired. Seven years later he was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nSt. Francis College.\nDuring Brennan's seven seasons the Terriers, playing in the Metropolitan New York Conference or as Independents, had a 90–46 record. Brennan has the highest win percentage as a head coach in Terrier basketball history at 66.2%."

        "text": "Sean Thomas Casey (born July 2, 1974), nicknamed \"the Mayor\", is an American former professional baseball first baseman and coach. He was the hitting coach for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB) in 2023. He played in MLB for the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, Pittsburgh Pirates, Detroit Tigers, and Boston Red Sox. Casey was selected to the MLB All-Star Game three times during his career. He was a broadcaster and commentator for the MLB Network.\nEarly life and education.\nCasey was born in Willingboro, New Jersey, the son of Joan and Jim Casey. He and his family moved to Upper St. Clair Township, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. He graduated from Upper St. Clair High School in Upper St. Clair, and the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia, where he played college baseball for the Richmond Spiders.\nAs a freshman for the Spiders in 1993, Casey had a .386 batting average, a .447 on-base percentage (OBP), and a .526 SLG, with two home runs. He was named a freshman All-American and second team All-Colonial Athletic Association (CAA).\nAs a sophomore in 1994, Casey batted .371 with a .656 SLG, 13 home runs, and 57 runs batted in (RBIs). He was named first team All-CAA. Following his sophomore season at Richmond, Casey played collegiate summer baseball for the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), where he batted .338 with one home run and 30 RBIs, and was named a league all-star. In 2003, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\nIn the 1995 season as a junior, Casey hit for a .461 batting average to lead all Division I players. Casey was again named first team All-CAA and won the CAA Player of the Year. He was also named a Second Team All-American and ECAC Player of the Year while becoming the first player to ever win the CAA Triple Crown. He graduated from Richmond and was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.\nPlaying career.\nCleveland Indians.\nThe Cleveland Indians chose Casey in the second round, with the 53rd overall selection, of the 1995 MLB draft. Casey began his professional career with the Watertown Indians of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League, where he batted .329 with two home runs. He was promoted to the Kinston Indians of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League to begin the 1996 season. He hit .331 with twelve home runs for Kinston.\nCasey started 1997 with the Akron Aeros of the Class AA Eastern League. On June 18, the Indians promoted Casey to the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AAA American Association after batting .386 with 19 doubles, 10 home runs and 66 RBIs in 62 games with Akron. In 20 games with Buffalo, Casey hit five home runs and 18 RBIs. On September 12, Casey was promoted to the Cleveland Indians as a September call-up. He appeared in six games for the Indians, going 2-for-10 (.200) with two walks and one RBI. Casey won the Lou Boudreau Award as the Cleveland Indians' top minor-league position player, at the conclusion of the 1997 season. \"Baseball America\" named him the No. 20 prospect in baseball before the 1998 season.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn March 30, 1998, Casey was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Dave Burba. On April 3, 1998, Casey was hit in the eye with a ball thrown by teammate Damian Jackson during batting practice, resulting in a fractured orbital, and subsequent surgery. Casey's surgery took two surgeons, operating for four hours to fix his fracture. Just three weeks after the surgery, Casey began his rehab assignment with the Indianapolis Indians, and just a week after joining the Indians, he was recalled to the Reds. Casey struggled during his first season with the Reds, his average dipped to .133, and he was sent back to Indianapolis. On June 18, Casey was recalled to the Reds.\nOn May 19, 1999, the Reds defeated the Colorado Rockies in a 24−12 final, tied for the fourth-highest run-scoring output in MLB history. Casey hit two of the Reds' six home runs, and reached base seven times with four hits and three walks. He also scored five runs and drove in six. He was selected to the All-Star Game for the first time in 1999. Casey produced a breakout offensive season in 1999, batting .332 with 25 home runs, 99 RBIs, 42 doubles, and 103 runs scored in 151 games. He was fourth in the National League in batting and doubles, and sixth in singles. In 1999, he won the Hutch Award.\nDuring his tenure in Cincinnati, and later in Pittsburgh and Detroit, Casey was regarded as approachable and friendly, and his nickname, \"the Mayor\", comes from his reputation for chatting casually with every runner who makes it to first base, and from his very public charity work. It was frequently expanded to \"the Mayor of Riverfront\" when the Reds played at Riverfront Stadium. On May 16, 2007, Casey was voted in 2007 as \"the friendliest player in baseball\" by fellow players in a Sports Illustrated poll. He garnered 46% of the vote with the second place vote being split between Jim Thome and Mike Sweeney with only 7% each. Casey was also regarded as among the slowest-running players in the game, grounding into 27 double plays in the 2005 season. This tied him with A. J. Pierzynski for the record of most grounding in double plays by a National League left-handed batter in a season.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn December 8, 2005, Casey was traded to his hometown Pittsburgh Pirates for left-handed pitcher Dave Williams. On April 14, 2006, Casey left a game against the Chicago Cubs after suffering two fractures of the transverse process in his lower left back. He was placed on the disabled list on April 15. After a rehab assignment with the Altoona Curve, Casey returned to the Pirates lineup. He played in 59 games for the Pirates during the 2006 season, batted .296 with three home runs and 29 RBIs.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn July 31, 2006, the Pirates traded Casey to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher Brian Rogers. During the 2006 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, he partially tore his left calf muscle in Game 1. After coming back from his torn calf in Game 2 of the World Series, Casey became the hottest hitter for the Tigers, belting two home runs and batting .432 in five games. His .432 batting average was one of the best in Tigers' postseason history.\nCasey has been active in Big Brothers and Make-A-Wish Foundation, as well as the \"Casey's Crew\" program, where he provided free high-priced tickets to disadvantaged youth. Casey credits his Christian upbringing in Pittsburgh's affluent Upper St. Clair suburb for his generosity.\nAfter being told by Dave Dombrowski and Jim Leyland that he would not be re-signed, Casey still praised Mike Ilitch, Dombrowski, and Jim Leyland for giving him the opportunity to come play for Detroit. Casey said \"They let me know. I've had a great time with this team, the greatest year and a half of my career. It was great. But I understand the situation.\"\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn February 5, 2008, the Boston Red Sox announced they had signed Casey to a one-year deal. On April 9, 2008, Red Sox third baseman Mike Lowell injured his thumb and was then placed on the DL, first baseman Kevin Youkilis was moved to third, and Casey stepped in as the starting first baseman and exploded by making some good defensive plays and hitting .318 with five RBIs in his first seven games despite missing games in Japan due to a stiff neck he received during the 18-hour flight. He was on the disabled list from April 26 through May 12, and returned as a significant part-time player, finishing the regular season with a .773 OPS on 199 at-bats in 69 games.\nCasey was suspended by the MLB for three games after his actions in the Coco Crisp–James Shields brawl.\nPost-playing career.\nCasey announced his retirement on January 25, 2009, at the age of 34, having played 12 seasons of Major League Baseball. He accepted a position as a baseball analyst for MLB Network. He appeared on \"MLB Tonight\", the Spring Training series \"30 Clubs in 30 Days\", the children-focused weekly interview and demonstration show \"Play Ball\" and MLB Network's special event coverage throughout the year.\nOn July 3, 2009, Casey sat in for Red Sox color commentator Jerry Remy, calling the first game for his old team. On January 14, 2011, the Reds announced that Casey would do color commentary for 15 telecasts on Fox Sports Ohio during the 2011 season.\nThe New York Yankees hired Casey as their hitting coach on July 10, 2023.\nAwards and accomplishments.\nWith Conan O'Brien, Casey is a founder of Labels Are For Jars, an innovative anti-hunger organization based in Lawrence, Massachusetts.\nIn a May 16, 2007, \"Sports Illustrated\" Player's Poll, Casey won the distinction of being considered the \"friendliest player in baseball\", after winning 46% of the votes. 464 MLB players participated in the survey. Hal McCoy, a Cincinnati Reds beat writer for 35 years, has said, \"There's no debate, and there never will be a debate. Sean Casey is the nicest guy in professional baseball. Ever.\"\nOn August 26, 2008, Casey was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.\nOn January 29, 2009, Casey was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.\nCasey was inducted to the Cincinnati Reds Baseball Hall of Fame (along with Dan Driessen and John Reilly) on June 23, 2012.\nIn 2014, Casey was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nCasey resides in Upper St. Clair Township, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Sarah Dade, and four children, Andrew, Jake, Carli, and Jillian."

        "text": "Walter William Harris (born November 9, 1946) is a former American football player and coach. Harris served as the head football coach at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California from 1989 to 1991, the University of Pittsburgh from 1997 to 2004, and at Stanford University from 2005 to 2006, compiling a career college football record of 69–85.\nPlaying and coaching career.\nHarris attended El Camino High School in South San Francisco, California. Harris received a bachelor's degree in 1968 and a master's degree in 1969 from the University of the Pacific, where he played college football as a defensive back. One of his coaches was Buddy Ryan.\nHis first college coaching position was as the defensive backs coach at Pacific, and the first recruit he signed was Pete Carroll. After a series of brief stops coaching defense that included a year as the defensive backs coach for Bill Parcells at Air Force, Harris had a career breakthrough when Mike White hired him as a quarterbacks coach at Illinois where he helped develop Dave Wilson, Tony Eason and Jack Trudeau, each of whom would go on to play in the NFL. He was then hired as the offensive coordinator at the University of Tennessee under Johnny Majors, helping the Volunteers win four of five bowl games while he was there. \nIn 1989, he received his first head coaching opportunity at his alma mater Pacific, where he assembled a staff that included future National Football League head coaches Jon Gruden and Hue Jackson. Coincidentally his first game as a head coach was a 38-3 loss against his future team, the Pitt Panthers.\nAfter three years coaching Pacific, Harris moved on to the NFL where he was the quarterbacks coach for the New York Jets from 1992 to 1994. A noted quarterback tutor, he helped Boomer Esiason return to form and earn a trip to the 1993 Pro Bowl.\nHe then spent two years as the quarterbacks coach at Ohio State working with future pro quarterbacks Bobby Hoying, Joe Germaine and Stanley Jackson.\nPittsburgh.\nHarris was hired to take over for his former mentor Johnny Majors as the head coach at the University of Pittsburgh in 1997, where the Pittsburgh Panthers football program was in decline. They had averaged just three wins per season over the previous five years and were coming off a 1996 season in which they had been outscored 266-13 in games against West Virginia, Ohio State, Miami, Syracuse and Notre Dame. He eventually led Pitt to five consecutive bowl games.\nIn 1997 the Panthers saw an immediate turnaround under Harris, who won Big East Coach of the Year honors. Pitt went to the Liberty Bowl, their first postseason game since 1989. The season included a nationally televised upset win on homecoming night against #21 Miami, another upset win over #15 Virginia Tech, and a triple overtime victory over West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl. \nPitt would post back-to-back losing seasons as they rebuilt in 1998 and 1999. The highlight of the 1999 season was a 37-27 win over Notre Dame in the final game at Pitt Stadium. \n2000.\nThe 2000 season would see the Panthers finish 7-5 and included a 12-0 shutout win over Penn State in the final game between the two rivals until 2016. They lost the Insight.com Bowl to Iowa State. Wide receiver Antonio Bryant won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the nation's outstanding receiver. \n2001.\nIn 2001 the Panthers overcame a 1-5 start to finish the season with a six game winning streak and a win over NC State in the Tangerine Bowl for their second straight 7-5 finish. \n2002.\nIn 2002, Pitt would achieve their first top-25 ranking in 11 years after an upset of unbeaten, #3 Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. They finished 9-4 after beating Oregon State, 38–13, in the Insight Bowl and ended the season ranked 19th. That year, Harris won the American Football Coaches Foundation (AFCA) Region I Coach of the Year. \n2003.\nThe Panthers began 2003 with high expectations. Prior to the season The Sporting News named the Pitt coaching staff the third best in the country. Pitt was ranked as high as 9th in the AP poll before a shocking loss to Toledo. They did upset #5 Virginia Tech to keep their hopes of winning the Big East alive before losses to Miami and West Virginia eliminated those hopes. They finished the season 8–5 but would drop out of the top-25 altogether after losing to Virginia in the Continental Tire Bowl. Larry Fitzgerald became the second Pitt wide receiver in four years to win the Fred Biletnikoff Award under the tutelage of Walt Harris. After the season Fitzgerald would become the 3rd overall pick in the NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals.\n2004.\nAfter a 2-2 start to the 2004 season which saw the Panthers need overtime to defeat FCS opponent Furman, the team would rally to close out the regular season on a three game winning streak that included victories over Notre Dame and West Virginia. Pitt would finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-3 and win their first-ever conference championship (they had been an independent until 1991). They also earned the first Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game in school history, and their first major bowl appearance in 21 years, when they were invited to the Fiesta Bowl to face undefeated #5 Utah. Harris won the Big East Coach of the Year award for the second time.\nDeparture from Pitt.\nAfter seeing a handful of top recruits slip away on signing day in part because of their doubts over the Pitt athletic department's commitment to Harris, he spent much of 2004 seeking a contract extension with Pitt. His already uneasy relationship with the athletic department would deteriorate further when his agent took the unusual step of publicly pressuring the university to give his client a new contract and making comments critical of Pitt. Harris met one final time with the athletic department prior to the Fiesta Bowl but was denied an extension despite the team's accomplishments. Shortly after that meeting Harris was offered the head coaching position at Stanford and accepted. Many of his Pitt players considered the move to essentially be a firing. After accepting the Stanford job, Harris chose to coach the Panthers in the Fiesta Bowl where they lost to Utah 35-7 in his final game with Pitt. One final twist in the unusual breakup came when Harris, almost immediately after joining Stanford, fired the agent who had criticized Pitt.\nHe left with a record of 52-44 and the third-most games, fourth-most wins, and the most bowl appearances in school history and was replaced by former NFL coach and Pitt alum Dave Wannstedt.\nStanford.\n2005.\nIn his first season as head coach at Stanford Harris posted a record of 5–6, including a 20-17 loss at home to UC Davis of the Great West Conference.\n2006.\nIn his second season as head coach the team posted a 1–11 record, the school's worst since going 0–10 in 1960. In a game against UCLA on October 1, 2006 Harris called for his quarterback to punt on 3rd down. Although the punt by Trent Edwards travelled 53 yards and pinned the Bruins at their own 13 yard line, Harris was heavily criticized for the decision in a 31-0 loss. He was fired on December 4, 2006, two days after Stanford's regular season ended. By the end of his tenure at Stanford, Harris had surpassed Jack Curtice with the lowest winning percentage in the history of Stanford football, with a .261 mark.\nAkron.\nIn February 2009 he joined the University of Akron coaching staff as quarterbacks coach and passing game coordinator, but the team struggled and head coach J. D. Brookhart lost his job at the end of the year.\nCalifornia (PA).\nIn April 2010, Harris became the offensive coordinator at California University of Pennsylvania. He was replaced after one season and reportedly turned down an offer to join the coaching staff at Colorado.\nCoaching style.\nDespite playing as a defensive back at Pacific and beginning his coaching career on defense, he eventually established himself as an offensive-minded coach. Harris primarily used a variation of the West Coast offense throughout his career.\nAt Pitt, he developed a string of highly successful wide receivers including Latef Grim, Antonio Bryant, Larry Fitzgerald, and Greg Lee which led to the Panthers gaining a reputation as \"Wide Receiver U.\"\nHarris has been viewed by some players as difficult to work with. One article about his departure from Stanford called him a \"disciplinarian\" and reported that a player briefly quit the team in protest of his coaching style.\nHarris also has a questionable history of play calling and game management. Hosting #20 Texas A&amp;M in 2002, Pitt was penalized on back-to-back snaps during an extra point attempt for using a player with an ineligible jersey number. After the penalties the Panthers missed the extra point, which proved costly as they found themselves needing a two-point conversion to tie the game after a late touchdown. The conversion was unsuccessful and Pitt lost the game 14-12. In 2004 Harris had both of his quarterbacks, Tyler Palko and Joe Flacco, punt on third down and long in the same game in a loss to Nebraska. Harris was also criticized after the 2003 Continental Tire Bowl for under-utilizing Heisman Trophy runner-up and eventual third overall NFL draft pick Larry Fitzgerald.\nPersonal life.\nAfter coaching Stanford, Harris moved back to the Pittsburgh area.  He has been known to attend Pitt games and practices.  He was an honorary captain for Pitt's 2016 game against Penn State.  In 2018 Harris, along with Johnny Majors, were made the honorary coaches for Pitt's annual Blue-Gold game.\nHe has three children."

        "title": "Phil Regan (baseball)",
        "text": "Philip Ramond Regan (born April 6, 1937) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, scout, and manager, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, and Chicago White Sox; he also managed the Baltimore Orioles. Regan served as the pitching coach for the New York Mets for part of the 2019 season.\nDuring the 1966 season, when Regan was Walter Alston's favorite pitcher from the Dodger bullpen, teammate Sandy Koufax nicknamed Regan \"the Vulture\", due to his knack for earning wins in late-inning relief situations.\nEarly years.\nRegan earned varsity letters in basketball, football, and baseball at Wayland High School in Wayland, Michigan. After one year at Western Michigan University, he signed with the Detroit Tigers in 1956. He compiled a 61-42 record and 3.76 earned run average as a starting pitcher in the Tigers' farm system before earning a call up to the majors midway through the 1960 season.\nPlaying career.\nDetroit Tigers.\nHe made his major league debut on July 19 against the Washington Senators. Entering the game already behind 3-0, he allowed just two hits in five innings of work, including a home run to Harmon Killebrew.\nHe made his first career start in the second game of a doubleheader with the Baltimore Orioles on July 23. He left the game with two outs in the ninth inning with the score tied at three, and the bases loaded. Relief pitcher Clem Labine walked Jim Gentile to drive in the winning run, and hand Regan his first career loss. Splitting his time between starts and relief appearances, he was 0-4 with a 4.50 ERA his rookie season. His first career win also came against Baltimore during his second season in the big leagues, when he went 10-7 with a 5.25 ERA.\nOver six seasons, Regan went 42-44 with a 4.50 ERA for the Detroit Tigers. He was 0-4 with a 4.99 ERA in 1965 when he was demoted to triple A Syracuse. He earned a call up that September, and made two appearances, but it was while he was with Syracuse that Regan learned of interest in him from the Dodgers organization.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nRegan called Tigers General Manager Jim Campbell asking to be traded, and on December 15, 1965, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for infielder Dick Tracewski.\nWith Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Claude Osteen, and Don Sutton in the starting rotation, Regan was used strictly as a reliever in 1966. He responded by going 14-1 with a 1.62 ERA, 88 strikeouts in 116 innings pitched and a National League leading 21 saves to help the Dodgers capture the NL pennant by a game and a half over the San Francisco Giants. It was on August 1 of that year, by Regan's own account, that he first acquired the \"Vulture\" moniker from Koufax, the latter having just exited his second consecutive game, tied 1-1, only to see Regan \"swoop in\" for the last-minute win.\nThe \"Sporting News\" named him the NL Reliever of the Year and NL Comeback Player of the Year in 1966. He also earned the only All-Star nod in his career, but did not appear in the game. He appeared in two games of the World Series, allowing just one base runner via a walk, and retiring the other five he faced.\nRegan won his first two decisions in 1967 to give him 15 consecutive wins before finally losing to the Houston Astros on May 15. He won both games of a doubleheader with the New York Mets on April 21, 1968. Two days later, he was traded with Jim Hickman to the Chicago Cubs for Jim Ellis and Ted Savage.\nChicago Cubs.\nRegan provided similar heroics for his new team. In his first two appearances as a Cub, he saved both games of an April 28 doubleheader with the Houston Astros. Despite missing the first 14 games of the Cubs' schedule, Regan led all of Major League Baseball with 25 saves in 1968 on his way to capturing a second \"Sporting News\" Reliever of the Year Award.\nHe was involved in a bizarre incident on August 18, 1968, against the Cincinnati Reds. Regan apparently had good stuff that day, too good for home plate umpire Chris Pelekoudas. Despite no illegal substances being found on the ball, Pelekoudas called 14 illegal pitches on Regan based simply on the movement of the ball. Regan met with NL President Warren Giles August 20, and was absolved of any wrongdoing. The incident earned Regan a reputation that followed him the rest of his career.\nRetirement.\nDuring the twilight of his career, Regan found his workload diminishing rapidly. Through May 1972, Regan had pitched just four innings for the Cubs. He asked to be traded or released, and on June 2, Regan's contract was sold to the crosstown Chicago White Sox. He appeared in ten games for the Chisox, going 0-1 with a 4.05 ERA before his release on July 20."

The award was first presented in 1955 as the \"SPORT\" Magazine Award, but is now decided during the final game of the Series by a committee of reporters and officials present at the game.\nOn September 29, 2017, it was renamed in honor of Willie Mays in remembrance of the 63rd anniversary of The Catch, which occurred the year before the award's debut; Mays never won the award himself.\nPitchers have been named Series MVP twenty-nine (29) times; four of them were relief pitchers. Twelve of the first fourteen World Series MVPs were won by pitchers; from 1969 until 1986, the proportion of pitcher MVPs declined—Rollie Fingers (1974) and Bret Saberhagen (1985) were the only two pitchers to win the award in this period. From 1987 until 1991, all of the World Series MVPs were pitchers, and, since 1995, pitchers have won the award nine times. The most recent pitcher to win the award is Stephen Strasburg, who won in 2019.\nTrophy.\nUp until 2017, the World Series MVP trophy was similar to the Commissioner's Trophy, albeit scaled down and with a single large gold-plated flag. After being renamed to Willie Mays World Series MVP Award for the 2018 edition and onward, the trophy is a wooden pedestal topped by a bronze sculpture of Willie Mays making the iconic catch in the 1954 World Series.\nGeneral Motors has provided a vehicle to the World Series MVP winner for 14 straight seasons through 2018.

        "title": "Cricket test",
        "text": "The cricket test, also known as the Tebbit test, was a controversial phrase coined in April 1990 by the British Conservative politician Norman Tebbit in reference to the perceived lack of loyalty to the England cricket team among South Asian and Caribbean immigrants and their children. Tebbit suggested that those immigrants who support their native countries rather than England at the sport of cricket are not significantly integrated into the United Kingdom.\nBackground.\nPost-war Britain experienced mass migration from the cricket playing countries of the West Indies and South Asia. Ever since, the issue of assimilation and multiculturalism has been a controversial issue in British politics.\nIn an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Tebbit said: \"A large proportion of Britain's Asian population fail to pass the cricket test. Which side do they cheer for? It's an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?\"\nTebbit told Woodrow Wyatt in 1991 that he did not think certain immigrant communities would assimilate \"because some of them insist on sticking to their own culture, like the Muslims in Bradford and so forth, and they are extremely dangerous.\"\nLegacy.\nThe phrase \"cricket test\" and the associated loyalty concepts received a lot of media attention for many months after Tebbit's statement, and have been widely discussed and argued over ever since. Rather than staying culturally separate, immigrants from the Windrush generation said they used cricket to overcome racism, gain acceptance and integrate into British society.\nLord Tebbit later claimed that his test could have prevented the 7 July 2005 London bombings. His remarks were decried by some media outlets as \"ignorant and outdated\".\nIn August 2018, Tebbit himself said that the test was no longer necessary. \"The Tebbit Test is immaterial now,\" he told \"The Indian Express\". \"If I were in charge of cricket, football or athletics in the country, I would be choosing British-Asians, Blacks and people from Ethiopia. I cheer for them. The race isn't an issue like it used to be. The time to talk stuff like ‘whether it’s in the blood’ is gone now. It has gradually washed away. Assimilation has already occurred. The more non-ethnic English get into the English cricket team, the more it will become obvious that the door is open to full integration.\""

The postseason tournament concluded with the Pittsburgh Steelers defeating the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL, 21–10, on February 5, at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan.\nAfter scrutiny in the Wild Card and Divisional rounds, the league reversed a two-year policy, and returned to \"all star\" officiating crews for the Conference Championship games. Since the 2003–04 NFL playoffs, postseason officiating had been done by entire crews from the regular season.\nSchedule.\nThese playoffs marked the final season that ABC televised the first two Wild Card playoff games. Super Bowl XL was also ABC's final Super Bowl telecast. In addition to taking over \"Sunday Night Football\" during the following season, NBC was awarded the first two Wild Card playoff games, as well as ABC's place in the annual Super Bowl broadcasting rotation. ABC would not broadcast a playoff game again until the 2015–16 playoffs when it started to simulcast the ESPN-produced Wild Card Game.\nCBS continued to televise the rest of the AFC playoff games and Fox the rest of the NFC games.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 7, 2006.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 17, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10.\nAlthough the Redskins gained only 120 yards on offense, the lowest total in NFL playoff history for a winning team, they converted two turnovers into touchdowns.\nMidway through the first quarter, Washington linebacker LaVar Arrington's 21-yard interception return set up running back Clinton Portis' six-yard touchdown run. Then, Redskins linebacker Marcus Washington recovered Tampa Bay running back Cadillac Williams' fumble and returned it seven yards before losing it himself – into the arms of safety Sean Taylor, who then ran 51 yards for the Redskins' second touchdown.\nEarly in the second quarter, Tampa Bay drove 38 yards to the Redskins' 24-yard line where Matt Bryant kicked a 43-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 14–3. The Redskins responded with a 10-play, 40-yard drive and scored with a 40-yard field goal from John Hall.\nIn the third quarter, Mark Jones gave the Buccaneers the ball at their own 49-yard line on a 24-yard punt return. Tampa Bay's offense then went on a 7-play, 51-yard drive that ended with quarterback Chris Simms' two-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay drove to the Redskins 19-yard line, but linebacker Lemar Marshall tackled fullback Mike Alstott for no gain on third down and 1, and then Simms threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Buccaneers cornerback Brian Kelly intercepted a pass from Mark Brunell on the Redskins' next drive and returned it to the Redskins 35-yard line. With three minutes left in the game, Tampa Bay wide receiver Edell Shepherd caught what appeared to be a 35-yard touchdown reception, but he lost control of the ball as he was coming down in the end zone for an incomplete pass. The Buccaneers got one last chance to tie the game when they received a punt at their own 46-yard line with 1:05 left in regulation, but Simms threw a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage and went into the arms of Marcus Washington for a game-ending interception.\nThe game was widely regarded by commentators as an \"ugly\" performance by both teams' offenses, rendering it a largely defensive game.\nAs of the conclusion of the 2022 NFL season, this remains Washington's last playoff victory, and is the final playoff victory for the \"Redskins\", as the controversial moniker was retired in 2020.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Redskins and Buccaneers. Tampa Bay won the only prior meeting.\nAFC: New England Patriots 28, Jacksonville Jaguars 3.\nThe three-time Super Bowl champion Patriots, who for the first time in their previous three playoff trips would have to win three games to advance to the Super Bowl, defeated the Jaguars 28–3. Linebacker Willie McGinest set NFL playoff records for sacks in a game (4.5, one ahead of the old record held by Richard Dent and Rich Milot) and career postseason sacks (16, two ahead of the old record held by Bruce Smith), while quarterback Tom Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdown passes.\nIn the first half, the Jaguars recorded four sacks and held New England to 126 yards, while the Patriots defense recorded two sacks, gave up only 115 yards, and did not allow a first down until 9:40 remained in the second quarter. Neither team could score in the first quarter, but early in the second, New England receiver Tim Dwight returned Chris Hanson's 46-yard punt 27 yards to the Jaguars 37-yard line. Two 4-yard runs by Corey Dillon and an 18-yard burst from Kevin Faulk then moved the ball to the 11-yard line, and Brady capped off the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Troy Brown. On Jacksonville's ensuing possession, Jimmy Smith's 19-yard reception gave his team a first down for the first time in the game and moved the ball to the Patriots 44-yard line. But on the next play, a tackle from safety Eugene Wilson caused Alvin Pearman to fumble the ball, and defensive end Richard Seymour recovered it. However, the Patriots could not take advantage of the turnover; Jacksonville managed to force a punt and then drove into scoring range for the first time in the game. Quarterback Byron Leftwich completed five passes for 59 yards on the drive, and Josh Scobee finished it with a 36-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 7–3. After the kickoff, Faulk's 21-yard reception moved the ball to midfield and gave the Patriots a chance to increase their lead before halftime, but receiver Deion Branch dropped a pass from Brady at the Jaguars 10-yard line with 19 seconds left.\nAfter forcing Jacksonville to punt on the opening drive of the second half, Brady led the Patriots 81-yards in 12 plays. On the 11th play, they nearly turned the ball over when tight end Benjamin Watson fumbled the ball on the Jaguars 5-yard line, but receiver André Davis recovered the ball, and Brady threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to David Givens on the next play. Then after forcing a punt, Brady threw a short pass to Watson who broke several tackles en route to a 63-yard score, increasing New England's lead to 21–3. After the kickoff, Leftwich led his team to the Patriots 32-yard line, but on the first play of the fourth quarter, cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted Leftwich's pass and took off for a 73-yard touchdown return, making the score 28–3. After that, Jacksonville mounted two more drives, but could not come away with any points. First they drove to the Patriots 8-yard line. But on third down and 2, McGinest sacked Leftwich for a 15-yard loss and Scobee missed a 41-yard field goal attempt on the next play. Then after forcing a punt, they drove to the Patriots 6-yard line, but ended up turning the ball over downs with five minutes left in the game.\nThis game also marked three career playoff records: Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick set records with 10 straight postseason victories, eclipsing Vince Lombardi's run with the Green Bay Packers in the 1960s.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Jaguars and Patriots. Both teams split the prior two meetings.\nSunday, January 8, 2006.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 23, New York Giants 0.\nThe Panthers forced five turnovers, limited the Giants to only 109 yards of total offense, and became the first club to shut out a home playoff team since the Los Angeles Rams shut out the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Championship Game. Although the Giants entered the game with Pro Bowler Tiki Barber starting at running back, the Panthers running game, featuring DeShaun Foster and Nick Goings, outgained the Giants 223 yards to 41 on the ground. Carolina wide receiver Steve Smith caught 10 passes for 84 yards and scored two touchdowns, a 22-yard reception and a 12-yard run, while kicker John Kasay added three field goals and Foster rushed for 151 yards. Meanwhile, quarterback Eli Manning threw three interceptions in his first playoff start.\nAfter the first five possessions of the game ended with punts, Carolina drove 77 yards in 12 plays and scored with Jake Delhomme's 22-yard touchdown pass to Smith. On Carolina's next possession, they were forced to punt, but New York safety Gibril Wilson muffed the kick and Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley recovered the ball at the Giants 15-yard line, setting up a 31-yard Kasay field goal to increase the lead to 10–0.\nCarolina dominated the second half, intercepting Manning three times. Midway through the third quarter, Ken Lucas intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 14 yards to the Giants 12-yard line, setting up Smith's 12-yard touchdown run on the next play. On New York's next drive, a 17-yard pass interference penalty on Lucas nullified his second interception and gave the Giants a first down at the Panthers 43-yard line. But two plays later, Manning's pass was intercepted by Marlon McCree at the 18. On the Panthers ensuing drive, Foster rushed three times for 44 yards, and Delhomme completed a 25-yard pass to Keary Colbert, moving the ball to the Giants 27-yard line where Kasay's 45-yard field goal made the score 20–0. Then five plays after the kickoff, McCree recorded his second interception on the Panthers 44-yard line. Carolina subsequently closed out the scoring with a 14-play, 55-yard drive that ended with Kasay's third field goal with 2:40 left in the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Giants.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 31, Cincinnati Bengals 17.\nThe Bengals' first playoff appearance in 15 years began when Pro Bowl quarterback Carson Palmer was knocked out of the game on their opening drive. They still managed to build an early 10-point lead, but gave up 24 unanswered points later in the game while turning the ball over three times.\nOn the Bengals second offensive play of the game, Palmer suffered a season-ending knee injury after being hit by Pittsburgh's Kimo von Oelhoffen, but his 66-yard pass to wide receiver Chris Henry (who was also injured on the play) set up kicker Shayne Graham's 23-yard field goal. Then after forcing a punt, backup quarterback Jon Kitna completed three consecutive passes for 40 yards and rushed for 11, while running back Rudi Johnson finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 10–0. Steelers cornerback Ike Taylor returned the ensuing kickoff 36 yards to the 40-yard line. Aided by a 15-yard penalty on cornerback Tory James, the Steelers subsequently drove 60 yards in eight plays and scored with Ben Roethlisberger's 19-yard touchdown pass to Willie Parker. The ensuing kickoff was returned by Tab Perry for 32 yards to his own 43-yard line, and then the Bengals drove 57 yards in 14 plays. Kitna completed the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh, retaking their 10-point lead, 17–7. But on the Steelers ensuing drive, Roethlisberger's 54-yard completion to Cedrick Wilson set up his 5-yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward, cutting the score to 17–14 at halftime.\nCincinnati took the second half kickoff and advanced the ball 62 yards to the Steelers 15-yard line. Graham attempted a 34-yard field goal but center Brad St. Louis' high snap sent the ball over holder Kyle Larson's head. Graham recovered the fumble, but the Steelers took over on the 34-yard line. On the seventh play of the drive, safety Kevin Kaesviharn committed a 40-yard pass interference penalty on the Bengals 5-yard line, and Jerome Bettis ran the ball into the end zone on the next play.\nAfter Cincinnati was forced to punt, Pittsburgh receiver Antwaan Randle El took a direct snap, ran to his right, and threw the ball back to Roethlisberger — who then connected with Wilson for a 43-yard touchdown reception that increased their lead to 28–17. Then on the Bengals next drive, inside linebacker James Farrior intercepted a pass from Kitna and returned it 22 yards to the Bengals 40-yard line, setting up a 23-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the fourth quarter, the Bengals managed to drive to the Steelers 43-yard line, but safety Troy Polamalu ended the drive with an interception and the Steelers offense ran out the rest of the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Steelers and Bengals.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 14, 2006.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 20, Washington Redskins 10.\nThe Seahawks overcame an early concussion suffered by NFL MVP and rushing champion Shaun Alexander, and three turnovers, to end their 21-year playoff victory drought. Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck led the offense, completing 16 out of 26 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 21 yards and another score. Despite the loss of Alexander, Seattle outgained the Redskins in rushing yards 119 to 59 and held Clinton Portis, who rushed for over 1,500 yards during the season, to just 41 yards on 17 carries.\nThe Seahawks took the opening kickoff and drove to the Redskins 11-yard line, but then Alexander lost a fumble without being touched, and linebacker Lemar Marshall recovered it. After that, the two teams were forced to punt on all their possessions in the first quarter, and with 5:28 remaining, Alexander was knocked out of the game.\nWashington scored first in the second quarter after a muffed punt set up John Hall's 26-yard field goal. Seattle responded by driving 74 yards in 12 plays and scoring with Hasselbeck's 29-yard touchdown pass to Darrell Jackson.\nAfter forcing the Redskins to punt on the opening drive of the third quarter, Hasselbeck led the Seahawks on an 81-yard scoring drive, completing four passes for 54 yards and finishing it with a 9-yard touchdown run to give his team a 14–3 lead. Washington responded with a drive to the Seahawks 33-yard line, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, quarterback Mark Brunell lost a fumble while being sacked by Bryce Fisher, and defensive end Grant Wistrom recovered it. One play later, Hasselbeck's 37-yard completion to Jackson set up a 33-yard field goal by Josh Brown on the second play of the fourth quarter, making the score 17–3.\nAfter the ensuing kickoff, Brunell's 52-yard completion to Chris Cooley moved the ball to Seattle's 24-yard line. Three plays later, he threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Santana Moss, a throw that bounced off the shoulder of Seattle cornerback Andre Dyson into Moss' arms. Washington got the ball back when Hall recovered a fumble from Josh Scobey at the Seahawks 40-yard line on the ensuing kickoff. But the Redskins drive stalled at the 18-yard line and ended with no points when Hall missed a 36-yard field goal attempt.\nSeattle then drove to the game-clinching field goal, led by fullback Mack Strong's career-long 32-yard run. The Seahawks' win was their first since a 1984 AFC Wild Card playoff win over the then-Los Angeles Raiders.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Redskins and Seahawks.\nAFC: Denver Broncos 27, New England Patriots 13.\nThe Broncos converted four out of five turnovers into 24 points as they eliminated the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Patriots, 27–13, and won their first playoff game since defeating the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII. This game also ended New England's league-record ten-game postseason winning streak and gave quarterback Tom Brady his first ever postseason loss.\nEarly in the second quarter, the Broncos drove to the Patriots 3-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs after failing to convert a fourth down and 1. Then after forcing a punt, Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer threw a pass that was intercepted by Asante Samuel. On the next play, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw a 51-yard completion to André Davis setting up Adam Vinatieri's 40-yard field goal to give New England a 3–0 lead.\nWith New England leading 3–0 with less than two minutes left in the first half, Broncos linebacker Ian Gold recovered a fumble from Kevin Faulk on the Patriots 40-yard line. After that, a pass interference penalty on Samuel moved the ball to the 1-yard line, and then Mike Anderson scored a 1-yard touchdown run on the next play. On the ensuing kickoff, Ellis Hobbs fumbled and kicker Todd Sauerbrun recovered the ball on the Patriots 39-yard line, setting up kicker Jason Elam's 50-yard field goal to give Denver a 10–3 halftime lead.\nEarly in the third quarter, the Patriots drove 58 yards in 11 plays and scored with a 32-yard field goal from Vinatieri, cutting their deficit to 10–6. With less than a minute to go in the third quarter, New England reached the Denver 5-yard line. However, Brady was intercepted for the first time in the playoffs since Super Bowl XXXVIII. The interception was returned by Champ Bailey for 101 yards before New England tight end Benjamin Watson knocked the ball out of bounds at the New England 1-yard line. The Patriots challenged whether the ball was actually knocked through and out of the end zone (which would have been a touchback and given the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line), but the original call stood. Anderson then ran for another one-yard touchdown on the next play to make it 17–6. Then on New England's next drive, the usually accurate Vinatieri missed a 42-yard field goal, his first in 21 field goal attempts in the playoffs. Later in the fourth quarter, Troy Brown muffed a Denver punt and the Broncos recovered it on New England's 15-yard line, setting up Rod Smith's four-yard touchdown pass from Plummer.\nWith 8:33 left in the game, Brady completed a 73-yard pass to Deion Branch and then followed it up with a 4-yard touchdown pass to David Givens, cutting the score to 24–13. But on the Broncos ensuing possession, Plummer's 42-yard completion to Smith set up another Elam field goal. Denver then all but clinched the game when safety John Lynch intercepted a Brady pass with less than three minutes left.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Patriots and Broncos, with Denver winning the only prior meeting.\nSunday, January 15, 2006.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Indianapolis Colts 18.\nThe Steelers became the first #6 playoff seed (since the league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990) to defeat a #1 seed, and also the first #6 seed to reach a conference championship game. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning threw for 290 passing yards and a touchdown, but it wasn't enough to win.\nThe Steelers stunned the Colts home crowd at the RCA Dome by driving 84 yards and scoring on their opening possession. Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed six consecutive passes for 76 yards, including a 36-yard completion to tight end Heath Miller and a 6-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle El. Later in the first quarter, Roethlisberger's 45-yard completion to Hines Ward moved the ball to the Colts 8-yard line, and they scored another touchdown with his 7-yard pass to Miller, increasing the Steelers' lead to 14–0.\nFive minutes into the second quarter, Indianapolis managed to get a good drive going, advancing the ball 96 yards to the Steelers 2-yard line and taking 9:39 off the clock, but were forced to settle for a field goal from Mike Vanderjagt, cutting their deficit to 14–3.\nLate in the third quarter, Steelers linebacker James Farrior (who finished the game with eight tackles and 2.5 sacks) sacked Manning at the Colts 1-yard line on third down, and Randle El returned Hunter Smith's ensuing punt 20 yards to the Indianapolis 30. Five plays later, Jerome Bettis scored a 1-yard touchdown run, making the score 21–3. But this time, Indianapolis struck back, driving 72 yards in six plays and scoring with Manning's 50-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. The Steelers were forced to punt on their ensuing drive, but only after taking over seven minutes off the clock, leaving just 6:03 left in the game by the time Indianapolis got the ball back.\nOne play after the punt, an interception by Pittsburgh safety Troy Polamalu was overturned by instant replay (a reversal that the league would later admit was a mistake). Taking advantage of his second chance, Manning completed a 9-yard pass to Clark, a 20-yard pass to Marvin Harrison, and a 24-yard pass to Reggie Wayne, moving the ball to the Steelers 3-yard line. Running back Edgerrin James finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, and then Manning threw a pass to Wayne for a successful 2-point conversion, cutting the Colts deficit to 21–18. The Steelers were forced to punt on their ensuing drive. But with 1:20 left in the game, Manning was sacked on fourth and 16 at the Colts' 2-yard line, and the ball was turned over to the Steelers on downs.\nAt this point, the game appeared to be over. However, the Steelers were forced to advance the ball towards another score instead of taking a quarterback kneel because the Colts still had three timeouts remaining. But on Pittsburgh's first play, in which Bettis tried to punch it in for an insurance touchdown, he fumbled for the first time all season when linebacker Gary Brackett popped it from Bettis' hands with his helmet. Nick Harper recovered the ball and appeared to be on his way for an Indy touchdown that would have given the Colts the lead when Roethlisberger barely made a season saving tackle at the Colts' 42-yard line, recovering from getting spun around to grab Harper's ankle, which brought him down. Eventually, the Colts then advanced to the Pittsburgh 28-yard line, but Vanderjagt, who had been perfect at home in the playoffs, missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal attempt wide right with 17 seconds left, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\nThis game marked the beginning of the end for Vanderjagt, who entered the game as the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage. The following year, the Colts decided to let his contract expire. He spent the next season with the Dallas Cowboys, where he made just 72% of his field goals before leaving the NFL for good.\nThis was the fifth postseason meeting between the Steelers and Colts, with Pittsburgh having won all four prior meetings.\nNFC: Carolina Panthers 29, Chicago Bears 21.\nThe Panthers recorded 434 yards of total offense, and avenged a 13–3 regular season defeat by the Bears, to advance to their third NFC Championship Game in their eleven-year existence. Carolina receiver Steve Smith caught 12 passes for 218 yards and two touchdowns, the first coming 55 seconds into the contest, and rushed for 26 yards. Panthers kicker John Kasay contributed three second-quarter field goals, while quarterback Jake Delhomme threw for 319 yards and three touchdowns. Although the Panthers lost key running back DeShaun Foster to a broken ankle in the third quarter, they still held off the Bears.\nThe Panthers got the ball first and scored quickly. Jamal Robertson returned the opening kickoff 34 yards to the 40-yard line, and one play later, Delhomme threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Smith. Later on, Smith's 46-yard reception set up a 20-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter, increasing their lead to 10–0. On their next drive, Carolina had a chance to increase their lead even more after Delhomme completed passes to Drew Carter for gains of 14 and 29 yards, moving the ball to the Bears 23-yard line. But linebacker Brian Urlacher ended the drive by intercepting a pass from Delhomme at the 10. However, the Panthers forced another punt and scored with a second field goal from Kasay. Bears quarterback Rex Grossman completed five passes for 62 yards on a 67-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson cutting the score to 13–7. But Carolina stormed right back, driving 51 yards and scoring with Kasay's third field goal on the last play of the first half.\nAfter the second half kickoff, a 24-yard run by Bears running back Thomas Jones moved the ball to the Panthers 41-yard line. Then Grossman went to work, completing two passes to Bernard Berrian for 29 yards before finishing the drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Desmond Clark. But after an exchange of punts, Delhomme threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Smith, and the Panthers retook their 9-point lead.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Chicago's Jason McKie scored a 3-yard touchdown run to cut their deficit to 23–21. But Delhomme led the Panthers right back, completing five passes for 45 yards and scoring with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kris Mangum. After an exchange of punts, the Bears drove into Carolina territory, but cornerback Ken Lucas put the game away by intercepting a pass from Grossman on the Panthers 22-yard line.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Bears.\nConference Championships.\nThis was the first time since the 1989–90 NFL playoffs that neither conference championship game took place in the Eastern or Central time zone. During that season, the Conference Championship Games were changed from the then-traditional starting times of 12:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. EST respectively. This was to accommodate the fact that the Denver Broncos and San Francisco 49ers hosted the 1989–90 AFC and NFC Championship Games in the Mountain Time Zone and Pacific Time Zone, respectively — thus avoiding a locally played game at 9:30 a.m. PST/10:30 a.m. MST, but also forcing the networks to change or move their prime time lineups in a moment's notice. When the league changed the traditional starting times for the 2002–03 NFL playoffs to 3 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. EST, it eliminated the future possibility of having to reschedule.\nSunday, January 22, 2006.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 34, Denver Broncos 17.\nFor the first time since 1984, the Steelers played on the road in the AFC Championship Game, but it hardly mattered as they forced four turnovers and went into halftime with a 24–3 lead en route to advancing to their sixth Super Bowl appearance in team history. In doing so, Pittsburgh became the first #6 playoff seed (since the league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990) to advance to the Super Bowl. Second-year quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, already in his fifth career playoff game, completed 21 of 29 passes for 275 yards and two touchdowns (one each to Cedrick Wilson and Hines Ward) and ran for a third. Steelers running back Jerome Bettis rushed for the other touchdown.\nPittsburgh scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 62 yards in 12 plays and ending it with a Jeff Reed field goal. Three plays after the kickoff, Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer lost a fumble while being sacked by Joey Porter and Steelers nose tackle Casey Hampton recovered it at the Denver 39-yard line. Four plays later, Roethlisberger's 12-yard touchdown pass to Wilson increased the Steelers lead to 10–0 on the first play of the second quarter. The Broncos responded by driving 55 yards and scoring with a field goal from Jason Elam. But Pittsburgh stormed right back, marching 80 yards in 14 plays and scoring with Bettis' 3-yard touchdown run to take a 17–3 lead. Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Ike Taylor intercepted a pass from Plummer on the Broncos 39-yard line. Four plays later, a Bettis touchdown run was called back because of a penalty on Ward. But Ward made up for his mistake by catching a touchdown pass on the next play, giving the Steelers a 24–3 lead with seven seconds left in the half.\nIn the third quarter, Plummer finally got the Broncos moving by completing four consecutive passes for 80 yards, the last one a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ashley Lelie. But Wilson caught two passes for 45 yards on Pittsburgh's next possession, setting up Reed's second field goal to make the score 27–10.\nIn the fourth quarter, a 38-yard reception by Lelie and a 22-yard pass interference penalty on Taylor set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Mike Anderson, cutting Denver's deficit to 27–17. But after a Steelers punt, defensive end Brett Keisel forced a fumble on fourth down from Plummer and his teammate Travis Kirschke recovered it at the Broncos 17-yard line. Four plays later, Roethlisberger ended any chance of a Denver comeback with a 4-yard touchdown run.\nThis would prove to be the Broncos' last playoff game with Mike Shanahan as their head coach, and last until 2011. It would also be Shanahan's last playoff game until 2012, with Washington.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Steelers and Broncos. Denver won three of the prior five meetings.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 34, Carolina Panthers 14.\nThe Seahawks forced four turnovers, and allowed only 36 rushing yards and 14 points, as they advanced to their first Super Bowl in the team's 30-year history. Meanwhile, running back Shaun Alexander, coming off his divisional round injury, rushed for a franchise playoff record 134 yards and two touchdowns.\nMidway through the first quarter, the Seahawks drove 57 yards in five plays, featuring a 28-yard reception by Seneca Wallace, and scored with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck's 17-yard touchdown pass to Jerramy Stevens. Then three plays after the ensuing kickoff, linebacker Lofa Tatupu intercepted a pass from Jake Delhomme and returned it 22 yards to the Panthers 20-yard line, setting up a field goal from Josh Brown. The next time Carolina got the ball, Delhomme was intercepted again, this time by Marquand Manuel, who returned it 32 yards to the Panthers 17-yard line, setting up Alexander's 1-yard touchdown run that increased Seattle's lead to 17–0 on the first play of the second quarter. The Panthers eventually cut the score to 17–7 on Steve Smith's 59-yard punt return for a touchdown with 9:56 left in the first half.\nThe Seahawks scored another 17 unanswered points. On their first drive after the punt return touchdown, they moved the ball 57 yards and scored with a 39-yard field goal from Brown. Brown missed a field goal on the Seahawks next possession, but on the first drive of the second half, they scored with Hasselbeck's 20-yard touchdown pass to Darrell Jackson. Then in the fourth quarter, they put the game completely out of reach with a 53-yard drive that ended with Alexander's second touchdown. Carolina responded with a 47-yard touchdown pass from Delhomme to receiver Drew Carter, cutting the score to 34–14, but by then there was only five minutes left in the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Panthers and Seahawks.\nSuper Bowl XL: Pittsburgh Steelers 21, Seattle Seahawks 10.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Seahawks and Steelers."

        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, was the eighth Olympic Championship, also serving as the 23rd World Championships and the 34th European Championships. The tournament was held at the Olympic Ice Stadium and the Apollonio Stadium.\nEast Germany and West Germany could not come to an agreement over how to formulate a combined team, so they played a qualification game against each other, which was won by West Germany. East Germany hosted a tournament for non-qualified teams, often referred to as World Championships \"Pool B\", between GDR, Norway and Belgium in Berlin.\nThe Soviets won all their games to claim their first Olympic title, their second World title, and their third European title. Canada, represented by the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen, won its eighth consecutive Olympic ice hockey medal, and first bronze medal.\nWorld Championship Group A (Italy).\nFirst round.\nTop two teams (shaded ones) from each group earned a right to play for 1st-6th places.\nFinal round.\nThe first place team, the Soviet Union, won the gold medal; the silver medal was won by the United States, and the bronze medal was won by Canada.\nComing into the final game of the tournament (Soviet Union vs Canada), the Soviets and Americans both had eight points while Canada had six points. A Canadian win would have created a three-way tie at eight points, to be broken by goal ratio. Canada (23/9=2.556) needed a victory by three or more to pass the Soviets (23/5=4.600). The Soviets would remain ahead of Canada with a win, a draw, or a loss by one or two. \nThe Americans (26/12=2.167) still had a chance at all three medal places due to the possibility of the goal ratios of Canada and/or the Soviets being sufficiently reduced according to the score of the final game.\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nGold medalists team USSR was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 29 years and 11 months. Team USA was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 22 years and 5 months. Tournament average was 26 years and 7 months."

        "title": "Ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, was the seventh Olympic Championship, also serving as the 19th World Championships and the 30th European Championships. The tournament was mainly played at the Jordal Amfi Arena, as well as the stadiums at Dælenenga (in Oslo), Kadettangen (Sandvika), Marienlyst (Drammen) and Lillestrøm (Lillestrøm). Canada, represented by the Edmonton Mercurys, won its sixth Olympic gold medal and 15th World Championship. Highest finishing European team Sweden won the bronze medal and its sixth European Championship.\nThe tournament was nearly not played at all. Discussions began in 1950, whether or not ice hockey would be included in the 1952 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) sought assurance that participating teams would adhere to its amateur code rather than the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) code, and also wanted to exclude IIHF president Fritz Kraatz from negotiations. IIHF past-president W. G. Hardy, and secretary George Dudley agreed there would be no negotiations on those terms, nor would they repudiate Kraatz. Dudley expected the IIHF to discuss having its own 1952 Ice Hockey World Championships instead, and stated that the Olympics would be a financial failure without the inclusion of hockey. In 1951 it was decided to drop hockey from the Olympic programme because of the controversies surrounding the 1948 Games. However, at the IOC congress in Romania the same year, it was reinstated. W. G. Hardy advocated for the inclusion of the Soviet Union national ice hockey team, provided there is no political interference. Despite his advocacy the Soviet authorities did not apply in time to be included in the tournament.\nTeams from Germany and Czechoslovakia rejoined the top level of international hockey this year. Nine nations played a round-robin with the top three nations receiving medals at the end. Swiss newspapers criticized the rough play by Canada and the United States team, and questioned whether hockey should be part of the Olympics. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president Doug Grimston felt the games were tame compared to North American standards and that the Olympics would suffer without hockey which was its biggest attraction.\nAfter Canada and the United States played to a draw in the final game of the round-robin, which placed the teams first and second respectively in the standings for the gold and silver medals. Had Canada won, the United States would have placed fourth. A newspaper in Moscow charged that a deal had been made to predetermine the outcome and assure the United States of a silver medal and to exclude the Czechoslovakia team from a medal. Canada won their sixth Olympic title, and fifteenth World title. The USA finished one point ahead of both Sweden and Czechoslovakia who both finished with six wins and two losses, additionally, they had an equal goal differential of +29. The Czechoslovaks had defeated the Swedes four to nothing on the final day, and believed that they had won the Olympic bronze, and the European Championship. However, organizers decided that they should play a final tie-breaking game, in which the Swedes overcame a three-goal deficit to win five to three.\nQualification.\nThe 1952 Olympic tournament, also the 1952 World Championship, “Category A,” was open to all teams assigned by the IIHF to Category A for 1952. This was the first Olympic tournament with any type of qualification procedure.\nFor the purpose of maximizing fan interest and minimizing lopsided games, the IIHF announced in September 1950 a new system to separate teams into Categories A and B for the World Championships, starting in 1951. If not otherwise qualified, the Olympic host nation was guaranteed assignment to Category A for 1951 and 1952.\nTeams were assigned to Category A for 1951 that\nAll other teams that played at any of the World Championships from 1949 to 1951 were assigned to Category B for 1951. Because of a rule that required a team to win two consecutive Category B tournaments to earn promotion to Category A, all of these 1951 Category B teams were eliminated from Olympic qualification.\nTeams were assigned to Category A for 1952 that\nTeams were assigned to Category B for 1952 that\nGreat Britain qualified for the 1952 Olympic tournament according to this procedure, but announced they would not play in late 1951, and instead requested entry into the Category B tournament. They planned to enter a team composed of English players only and did not expect them to be competitive at the Olympics.\nWorld Championships Group A (Norway).\nAn additional game was played between Sweden and Czechoslovakia because they finished tied for a medal place on points (12) and goal difference (+29).\nWorld Championship Group B (Belgium).\nPlayed in Liege 15–22 March 1952. British manager Johnny Murray won with a roster composed entirely with English players; no Scots or Canadians.\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam Germany was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 27 years and 10 months. Team Norway was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 23 years and 9 months. Gold medalists Canada averaged 26 years and 5 months. Tournament average was 25 years and 8 months."

        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1964 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, was the tenth Olympic Championship, also serving as the 31st World Championships and the 42nd European Championships. The games were held at the Olympiahalle Innsbruck.\nThe Soviet Union won its second Olympic gold medal, fourth World Championship and eighth European Championship. Canada, represented for the first time by a purpose-built national team organized and coached by Father David Bauer, was shut out of the medals for the first time in Olympic ice hockey history—still in contention for the gold medal on the last day until a loss to the Soviets, the Canadians placed fourth and were denied a bronze medal.\nQualification.\nPrior to the tournament it was determined that there would be a spot allocated for an Asia/Oceanic representative. Also, for the third (and final time) East played West to decide the German representative in the Olympic hockey tournament.\nFirst round (A/B).\nWinners (in bold) qualified for the Group A to play for 1st–8th places. Teams which lost their qualification matches, played in Group B for 9th–16th places. Countries were seeded (roughly) from their placement at the 1963 World Ice Hockey Championships. Switzerland was the only 'B' pool team to win, defeating Norway who was also from the 'B' pool.\nWorld Championship Group A (Austria).\nFinal round.\nDuring the Canada versus Sweden game, Swedish player Carl-Göran Öberg broke his stick and tossed it aside. The broken end of the stick went towards the Canadian bench, where it struck their coach Father David Bauer in the face and opened a bleeding wound. Bauer demanded for his players to remain on the bench and not retaliate, since he did not want to take penalties late in the game. Canada went on to win by a 3–1 score, and Bauer forgave Öberg for the incident. On the next day, Bauer invited Öberg to sit with him while watching the Soviet Union play Czechoslovakia.\nFirst place team wins gold, second silver and third bronze.\nWorld Championship Group B (Austria).\nConsolation round.\nTeams in this group play for 9th–16th places.\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam Sweden was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 27 years and 3 months. Team Canada was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 22 years and 11 months. Gold medalists team USSR averaged 25 years and 8 months. Tournament average was 25 years and 1 months.\nMedalists.\nSweden, Czechoslovakia and Canada finished with identical records of five wins and two losses. Canada thought they had won the bronze medal based on the goal differential in the three games among the tied countries. When they attended the presentation of the Olympic medals, they were disappointed to learn they had finished in fourth place based on the Olympics tie-breaking procedure of goal differential from all seven games played. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president Art Potter and the Canadian players accused International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) president Bunny Ahearne of making a last-minute decision to change the rules and take away a medal from Canada, and The Canadian Press quoted Ahearne as stating that the IIHF decided on a tie-breaking procedure with 10 minutes remaining in the final game.\nFather Bauer was awarded a gold medal for his example of good sportsmanship in the stick-throwing incident. Later that night, the Canadian players gathered in his room where Marshall Johnston summarized the team's feeling that, \"The shepherd and his flock have been fleeced\". At the CAHA general meeting in May 1964, Ahearne clarified that the decision to place Canada fourth in the standings was supported by the IIHF statutes and that no rules were changed. Former CAHA president and past IIHF president Robert Lebel agreed that the correct decision was made despite the accusations.\nIn April 2005, the IIHF was reported by The Canadian Press to have admitted to a mistake in 1964 and voted to retroactively award a bronze medal in the 1964 World Championship (but not the 1964 Olympics which had different rules) to Canada. In June 2005, the IIHF voted against the reversal. IIHF vice-president Murray Costello, stated had the reversal been carried out it would have set a precedent for other past decisions to be questioned."

        "title": "Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The men's ice hockey tournament at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, was the 12th Olympic Championship. Games were held at the Makomanai Ice Arena and at the Tsukisamu Indoor Skating Rink. The Soviet Union won its fourth gold medal. The United States won the silver, while Czechoslovakia won the bronze. Canada did not send a team to the event for the first time since ice hockey was first competed at the Olympics in 1920, instead competing with and defeating the Soviets in a competition later that year known as the Summit Series. Canada would not send a men's hockey team to the Olympics until 1980.\nTeams.\nTeam Canada.\nFor the first time since ice hockey was introduced at the Olympic Games in 1920, Canada did not send a team to the 1972 Olympics after Canadian Minister of Health and Welfare John Munro announced the withdrawal of the team from all international competitions in response to the International Ice Hockey Federation opposition to allowing professional players at international competitions. Canadian officials were frustrated that their best players, competing in the National Hockey League, were prevented from playing while Soviet players, who were \"employees\" of the industrial or military organizations that fielded \"amateur\" teams, were allowed to compete. At that point, the Canadian men's ice hockey team was the most successful team in the world, having won six of the eleven tournaments previously competed, with medals in ten of the eleven tournaments (and a controversial post-tournament rule change denying them a perfect eleven medals). Canada would not compete internationally in hockey until 1977, when the IIHF adopted eligibility rules that allowed for professional players to compete. Instead of competing internationally at the Olympics, Canadian officials helped organize a series of games against the Soviet Union in 1972 known as the Summit Series.\nTeam USA.\nWhile the 1980 team had the celebrated \"Miracle on Ice\" and the 1960 US team had the \"Forgotten Miracle\", the 1972 team could be called the \"completely overlooked miracle.\" The U.S. team was expected to finish 5th behind the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Finland. The Soviet and Czech teams were especially powerful as there was no distinction between amateurs and pros in communist countries; these teams were made up of seasoned professionals and were ranked 1 &amp; 2 in the world. Valeri Kharlamov of the Soviet Union was considered one of the world's best players and experts agree he would have been a star in the NHL. The same can be said for Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. In fact, this was basically the same Soviet Team that played a Canadian team composed of NHL All Stars in the 1972 Summit Series that Canada narrowly won, 4–3–1.\nAfter qualifying for Group A by beating Switzerland 5–3, the U.S. lost as expected to Sweden, 5–1. Then they pulled off the upset of the tournament when they beat Czechoslovakia, 5–1. This surprising result was nearly as astonishing as the wins over the Soviets in 1960 and 1980. After losing as expected to the Soviet Union, the young Americans upset Finland. In the final games of the competition, the U.S. beat Poland while Finland beat Sweden and the Soviets beat the Czechs (in the game that decided the gold medal); those results boosted the U.S. from 4th to 2nd for an unexpected silver medal.\nFirst round.\nFourteen nations qualified, but East Germany, Romania and France all chose not to travel for primarily financial reasons. The remaining eleven nations were seeded according to their placement in the 1971 World Championships with first place (USSR) and the five winners to play in Group A to for 1st–6th places. The five losers played in Group B for 7th–11th places. 1971 ranking appears in parentheses.\nFinal round.\nFirst place team wins gold, second silver and third bronze.\nConsolation Round.\nTeams, which lost their games in the qualification round, played in this group.\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nGold medalists team USSR was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 26 years and 4 months. Team USA was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 23 years and 3 months. Tournament average was 25 years and 3 months."

The games were played at the Méribel Ice Palace in Méribel, about 45 km from host city Albertville. The competition, held from 9 to 23 February, was won by the Unified Team in its only appearance. The team was composed of some newly emerged nations from the former Soviet Union, which had dissolved just weeks before the Games began. Canada won the silver medal, its first hockey medal since 1968 and 11th Olympic ice hockey medal.\nQualification.\nThe Olympic tournament was to be contested by twelve nations. The top eleven nations from the 1991 World Championships (eight from pool A, top three from pool B) qualified directly, while the twelfth ranked nation had to play off against the winner of that year's pool C.\nPoland qualified in final tournament\nFirst round.\nTwelve participating teams were placed in two groups.

Instead of giving the gold to someone who did not play, coach Viktor Tikhonov kept it. Only players are given Olympic medals; coaches and management are not. The medal was returned to Khabibulin in a private medal ceremony during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah."

        "title": "Skeleton Lake (Ontario)",
        "text": "Skeleton Lake is a lake in the municipalities of Huntsville and Muskoka Lakes in the District Municipality of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada, about west of the town centre of Huntsville. Up until 1991, the Ministry of Natural Resources operated a fish hatchery on the lake.\nGeography.\nThe lake is about long and wide, lies at an elevation of and is in the Lake Huron drainage basin. The sole outflow is the Skeleton River at the west of the lake. It is controlled by the Skeleton Lake Dam and flows through the community of Bent River to Skeleton Bay on Lake Rosseau.\nThere are two public use islands in the area. The Hog's Back is a small rock island which used to exhibit much religious graffiti, but has since been eco-scrubbed and now is a bare rock with a fire pit, near Greer Bay. Anderson's island has a population of silver birches, along with a cliff-jumping area on the south-east side of the island, and also has religious oriented graffiti carved into the trees and painted onto rocks. Other public access areas exist including a government dock in Wilson's Bay.\nGeology.\nThe lake is thought to have been formed as a result of a meteorite impact. About 800 million years ago, an asteroid impact is suspected to have created a crater much larger than the remnant lake. Periods of glaciation since then have removed the original crater, leaving a lake approximately 2.2 miles across and 100 meters deep at its center. Skeleton Lake is recognized as a suspected impact crater. Ironclad evidence of the impact hypothesis would have been removed during the ice ages, and unless more shock geomorphology is found the crater's origin cannot be certified beyond a reasonable doubt. Due to the spring fed nature of the lake, the water is exceptionally clear. According to residents of the lake, on calm days it is possible to see up to underwater with the naked eye.\nFolklore.\nSkeleton Lake, or the pool of bones, is so named because when surveyors were working on the north shore, they came upon two skeletons resting on the rocks. When they asked a local Indian chief where the skeletons came from, they were told that he and his people had camped one winter on Skeleton Lake. When food became scarce the tribe decided to move elsewhere. One mother, with a fourteen-year-old son too weak to move, refused to accompany them. They died together of starvation, and the lake was named in memory of this mother and her son. It is said there is an underground current that leads south but no attempts have been made to find where it leads.\nRecreation.\nThe open body of water in Skeleton Lake is about the largest open body of water in all the Muskoka Lakes. This makes it an excellent lake for such sports as sailing and windsurfing, though there can be rough water.\nFishing is very difficult in the lake. Bass and trout can be caught. In the spring, lake trout will strike at minnows in cold shallow water. Later in the summer, trout like to stay in cold water below the second thermocline, which is typically 50–70 feet. This requires down-riggers to get the bait to the right depth. Bass can be caught in shallower depths.\nThere is a cottagers' association for the many cottagers who spend their time at Skeleton Lake.\nSummer Camps.\nSkeleton Lake is home to several religion-based camps including Camp Ramah in Canada, a Jewish summer camp; Camp Kwasind, a Baptist camp; and Camp Newport, operated by The Salvation Army."

        "text": "Chaudhry Abdul Jalil (, born 8 October 1949), famously known as Chacha Cricket () (meaning 'Uncle Cricket'), is a Pakistani cricket mascot.\nJalil is regularly seen at cricket matches involving Pakistan. He is easily recognized by his white beard, his full green kurta dress, and his white cap decorated with a sequined star and crescent moon. He is usually armed with a Pakistani flag and initiates many crowd chants.\nWhile his support for Pakistan is very strong, he remains good-natured and is also a popular figure amongst opposition fans such as England's Barmy Army.\nCareer.\nEarly years (1969–1996).\nJalil watched his first international match at Lahore Stadium at the age of 19, when the England team led by Colin Cowdrey visited Pakistan in 1969. From 1973 to 1996, he worked as an assistant foreman at a water-pumping station in Abu Dhabi. He first rose to prominence during the 1994 Austral-Asia Cup in Sharjah, where he debuted his unique outfit and his ability to engage the crowd in passionate chants.\nBy 1996, his face was recognizable to virtually every Pakistani cricket fan. It was then that the Pakistan Cricket Board offered him to become their official cheerleader. PCB Chairman Syed Zulfiqar Bokhari asked him to return to Pakistan, where he would be sponsored by the Board to accompany the national team on domestic and foreign tours. Jalil consulted with cricketers Wasim Akram and Moin Khan, who persuaded him to come since they expected Pakistan International Airlines cricket team, the team they represented domestically, to employ him. Therefore, he returned to his native country after leaving his job in 1998.\nReturn to Pakistan.\nWhen he returned, elections had taken place, and the new government brought changes to the Pakistan Cricket Board. Bokhari stepped down and the new secretary, Waqar Ahmed, was not on board with the idea of a travelling cheerleader. As a result, he did not get an official recommendation for his visa application for the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. He, therefore, went to the embassy with pictures of himself at cricket grounds across the world, which impressed a senior official who approved his application.\nPersonal life.\nJalil hails from Sialkot in the Punjab province of Pakistan. He is married and had five children."

Known as one of the best defensive guards of his era, Friedman later coached the Troy Haymakers. He promoted basketball internationally during World War I, organizing a 600-team tournament in France that led to the Inter-Allied Games. Post-retirement, he owned a parking garage in New York City before retiring in 1959. Friedman was inducted into multiple halls of fame and named to the All-Time Pro Second Team in 1941.\nEarly life.\nFriedman was born in New York City and grew up on Manhattan's Lower East Side. He attended high school at Hebrew Technical Institute.\nCareer.\nFriedman played eighteen years of pro basketball in many different pre-NBA leagues but is best known for playing with the New York Whirlwinds. He is considered to be one of the best defensive guards of his era. He later became coach of the Troy Haymakers in the ABL (1938/39).\nIn a seventeen-year career (1910–1927), Friedman played in almost every league in the East, habitually leading his team to championships. In 1921, he played with the New York Whirlwinds. In the World Championship series, 11,000 people watched Friedman hold Celtics' shooting star Johnny Beckman to one field goal as the Whirlwinds defeated the Original Celtics, 40–27. The Celtics won the second game, 26–24, but officials were afraid that the excitable and unruly crowds would lose control, and the deciding third game was never played.\nWhen World War I began, Friedman promoted basketball internationally. He organized a 600-team tournament in France, which prompted the Inter-Allied Games, a forerunner to the World Championships and Olympic recognition.\nHe and Barney Sedran were referred to as \"The Heavenly Twins\". After his retirement from basketball, Friedman became the owner of a parking garage (his father had owned a pushcart stable), located at East 49th Street, east of First Avenue, in New York City, which served Tudor City Apartments and environs. He sold his garage and retired in 1959, at the age of seventy.\nFriedman was named to the Basketball Hall of Fame, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame, and the All-Time Pro Second Team in 1941."

He led NCAA Division I that year in both total steals and stolen base percentage.\nWhile at Florida A&amp;M, Coleman was also a kicker and punter on the Florida A&amp;M Rattlers football team, where he followed in the footsteps of his cousin, Greg Coleman, who was also a punter at Florida A&amp;M in the 1970s and went on to a 12-year career in the National Football League. Vince Coleman was a member of the Rattlers team that won the 1978 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. He was named to the all-conference team in both 1980 and 1981 and kicked a game-winning 34-yard field goal in an unlikely 16–13 Rattlers win over the Division I-A Miami Hurricanes in 1979.\nColeman signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins in 1982 but quit after a week of training camp because the team wanted to convert him into a wide receiver.\nColeman chose to pursue a baseball career when he was drafted in the 10th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He stole 145 bases in a single season with the Macon Redbirds of the South Atlantic League in 1983; Coleman did so despite missing a month of the season with a broken hand. He further demonstrated his speed and base-stealing ability with 101 steals for the Louisville Redbirds of the American Association in 1984, before being called up to the majors.\nMajor League Baseball career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nColeman stole 110 bases in his rookie season. As of 2022, the 110 steals are the ninth-highest in Major League history. Coleman stole over 100 bases in each of the following two seasons as well, making him the only player in the 20th century to post three consecutive seasons of 100 or more steals and the first player in Major League history to steal 100 bases in the first three seasons of their career. By the end of only his second year, his 217 stolen bases were second in Cardinal history behind Lou Brock's 888, just ahead of the 203 by Jack Smith. Before signing as a free agent with New York, Coleman led the National League in stolen bases in every season he played with the Cardinals (–), becoming one of just four players ever to lead his league in six consecutive seasons. The other players to accomplish this feat are Rickey Henderson, Luis Aparicio, and Maury Wills. Coleman, Henderson, Wills, and Brock are the only players to steal 100 bases in a season. Only Coleman and Henderson have three different 100-steal seasons to their credit, and only Coleman reached the total in three consecutive years.\nAs the leadoff hitter for St. Louis, Coleman helped the team reach the 1985 playoffs. However, he suffered an injury prior to the fourth game of the National League Championship Series, when the automatic tarpaulin at Busch Stadium rolled over his leg during routine stretching exercises. The injury sidelined him for the rest of the postseason, and the Cardinals eventually lost a seven-game World Series to Kansas City. Following the season, Coleman became the fourth-ever unanimous selection for the NL Rookie of the Year Award.\nIn 1985, Coleman declared, \"I don't know nothin' about him. Why are you asking me about Jackie Robinson?\" Responding to Coleman, Rachel Robinson, Jackie Robinson's widow said, \"I hope somehow he'll learn and be embarrassed by his own ignorance.\"\nColeman compiled the best season of his major league career in , when he posted a .289 batting average and a .363 on-base percentage while totaling 180 hits, 109 stolen bases, and 121 runs scored. He stole second and third base in the same inning 13 times that year. Coleman played in the World Series that year, the only one he would appear in. He batted .143 while reaching base six times (four hits, two walks) and stealing six bases without being caught. In the field, he made two assists (i.e. throws to home from left field for outs), both coming in Game 7; he was the first outfielder to throw two runners out at the plate in one World Series game. The Cardinals lost the Series in 7 games to the Minnesota Twins.\nIn 1989, Coleman compiled a streak of 50 successful stolen bases without being caught stealing, before it was broken on July 28 when he was thrown out by Montreal Expos catcher Nelson Santovenia in a game at Olympic Stadium.\nIn June 1990, he recorded his 500th stolen base in just his 804th game, the fewest that any player has needed to reach that milestone. As of the end of the 2022 MLB season, he is the last player to steal 100 bases in a single season.\nNew York Mets.\nColeman left for the Mets after the 1990 season via free agency, signing a four-year, $11.95 million contract. However, his career took a quick downward turn. He missed 215 games (out of a possible 486) due to numerous injuries and suspensions. Coleman was one of three Met players named in a sexual assault complaint filed by a 31-year-old woman in Florida, although prosecutors did not pursue charges in the case. His base-stealing strategy became increasingly suspect; he often ignored or misinterpreted his coaches' signs on the basepaths. He was also very difficult to get along with. He got into an argument with coach Mike Cubbage at the end of his first season with the Mets, which was a factor in manager Bud Harrelson's ouster. In September 1992, he got into a fight with Harrelson's successor, Jeff Torborg, and was suspended without pay for the rest of the season.\nThe Mets seemingly had enough and tried to trade Coleman, but there were no takers. In April 1993, Coleman injured Dwight Gooden's arm by recklessly swinging a golf club in the clubhouse. Three months later, Coleman was charged with endangerment when he threw a lit firecracker into a crowd of baseball fans waiting for autographs in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. The explosion injured three children, including a two-year-old, Amanda Santos. He was sentenced to 200 hours of community service for the incident while the Mets suspended him with pay. On August 26, the Mets announced that as part of a general house-cleaning of the clubhouse, Coleman would not return in 1994. Manager Dallas Green said that while Coleman had played well, he did not think he had the \"head and heart and belly\" he wanted to see on the team.\nLater career.\nAt the end of the season, the Mets traded him, with cash, to the Kansas City Royals for Kevin McReynolds. He recorded 76 steals in 179 games as a Royal before being traded to the Seattle Mariners in mid-. found Coleman with the Cincinnati Reds, and was subsequently released by the team in June, and he signed with the California Angels, but never played a game for the team. Coleman's final season in the major leagues came in 1997 with the Detroit Tigers, where he again received limited playing time and little success on the basepaths or elsewhere.\nColeman attempted a comeback with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998 and hit over .300 in spring training, but did not earn a spot on the opening-day roster. He was assigned to the AAA Memphis Redbirds, where he continued to play well, stealing eight bases and hitting .316 with an on-base percentage of .395 in 20 games as the club's regular left fielder and leadoff man. However, after failing to receive a promotion to St. Louis, Coleman elected to retire in May 1998.\nThrough the 2021 MLB season, Coleman ranks sixth in all-time career stolen bases in the major leagues, with 752. , Coleman ranks 52nd all-time in career stolen base percentage among all players with 80 or more attempts, at 80.9%.\nCoaching.\nThe Chicago White Sox added Vince Coleman to their staff as a base-running instructor for the 2015 season. The San Francisco Giants hired him as a roving Minor League baserunning and outfield coach in 2017."

The teams are located in Southern Ontario.\nThe league was formed in 1919 and has enjoyed much success over its long history. Teams are run similar to a professional minor-league team, providing players an opportunity to play under the same conditions, using wooden bats and minor-league specification baseballs. Teams play 42 scheduled games from early May to late-August. The playoffs are best-of-five series with the championship series typically played around Labour Day. The most recent champions are the Welland Jackfish, who defeated the Barrie Baycats 4-2 in the 2023 Dominico Cup Final.\nHistory.\nThe Intercounty Baseball League (IBL) was founded in 1919 with just four cities represented — Galt, Guelph, Stratford and Kitchener, and is the oldest amateur men's league in Canada. During the early years, the league expanded to include the cities of Waterloo, Brantford, Preston, London, and St. Thomas.\nIt was previously known as the Intercounty Major Baseball League and the Senior Intercounty Baseball League.

        "text": "Joseph Darley Kennedy (May 24, 1979 – November 23, 2007) was an American Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched from 2001 to 2007 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Colorado Rockies, Oakland Athletics, Arizona Diamondbacks, and the Toronto Blue Jays.\nEarly life.\nKennedy was born in La Mesa, California to John and Holly Kennedy. He had an older brother, John Kennedy Jr., and a younger sister, Bettianne Kennedy. Kennedy played Little League in El Cajon, California. He was a member of the 1991 El Cajon American Little League team that won the Southern California Little League championship. The team was eliminated after a first-round 3–1 loss to Kahulia East Maui in the West Region Tournament in San Bernardino. He graduated from El Cajon Valley High School, where he played baseball as well as basketball, volleyball and football, and attended Grossmont College before entering the major league draft.\nProfessional career.\nKennedy was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the eighth round (252nd overall) of the Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on June 6, with the Devil Rays.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays.\nKennedy made his Major League debut on June 6, 2001, becoming the first lefthander to start a game for the Devil Rays in 219 games. He finished 7–8 in 20 starts for the Devil Rays.\nIn his second season, he pitched in 30 starts going 8-11 while throwing 5 complete games for the Devil Rays. In 2003, he was named the Opening Day starter for the Devil Rays after having an abysmal spring training. He made 22 straight starts before being relegated to the bullpen after suffering an arm injury in . He had pitched in 72 consecutive starts for the Devil Rays before being moved to the bullpen.\nHe recorded his first career save on September 10, 2003, against the Blue Jays, pitching three scoreless innings.\nColorado Rockies.\nTraded to the Colorado Rockies before the season, Kennedy became the first Rockies starter to have a sub 4.00 earned run average, setting a franchise record with a 3.66 ERA while going 9-7 for the Rockies. In 2005, Kennedy struggled as a starter for the Rockies, going 4–8 with a 7.04 ERA.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn June 5, 2005, the A's showed interest in Kennedy. On July 13 of that year, Kennedy, along with pitcher Jay Witasick, was traded by the Rockies to the Oakland Athletics for outfielder Eric Byrnes and minor league infield prospect Omar Quintanilla. Kennedy pitched in the bullpen for Oakland before being pressed into the starter role in September when Rich Harden was injured. Kennedy went 1-5 as a starter for Oakland, and finished the year with a 4–5 record and a 4.70 ERA in the American League.\nKennedy pitched well in a middle relief role in Oakland's bullpen in 2006, with a record of 4-1 and a 2.31 ERA. Unfortunately, his role was diminished as he missed three months with shoulder and biceps injuries. Despite struggling in spring training with an ERA above 11.00, Kennedy was named the fifth starter for the Athletics at the start of the season. Through June 2 he compiled a 1–4 record with a 3.30 ERA in 62 innings. He was ineffective afterwards and was placed on waivers.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nKennedy was claimed by the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 4 after being placed on waivers by the Athletics. He was designated for assignment on August 15 after allowing 7 runs in 3 games and was released by the Diamondbacks.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nHe signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays on August 28 and was called up to the major league team on September 2. He pitched in nine games, all in relief, for the Blue Jays in the final month of the season and went 1–0 with a 5.14 ERA. He became a free agent after the season.\nScouting.\nKennedy had a bevy of pitches at his disposal, featuring a 92-96 MPH four-seam fastball, a 90-92 MPH two-seam fastball, a slow curve, a diving slider and, possibly his second-best pitch after his fastball, a deceptive changeup. His powerful delivery was at the 3/4-sidearm slot, which made his pitches particularly hard for left-handed batters to pick up. He was also very effective against right-handed batters. After struggling a little as a spot-starter for the Athletics, he pitched well in the bullpen in 2006, holding his opponents to a .254 batting average and going 4–1 with a 2.31 ERA.\nDeath.\nOn November 23, 2007, Kennedy was in Florida to be the best man at the wedding of a friend. He woke up in the middle of the night and collapsed at the home of his in-laws. He was taken to HCA Florida Brandon Hospital in Brandon, where he was pronounced dead. At the time of Kennedy's death, he was married to Jami Kennedy, who was pregnant with their second child (the couple's first son was one year old at the time.) On January 15, 2008, it was announced by the medical examiner that Kennedy had died of hypertensive heart disease with degeneration of the mitral valve.\nAfter Kennedy's death, Frank Thomas, whom Kennedy was teammates with on the Oakland Athletics and the Toronto Blue Jays, kept Kennedy's glove in his locker wherever he played until he retired from the MLB in 2010."

It is in Travelcard Zone 3 and is arranged as an island eight-car platform, with stairs descending to street level towards the southern end.\nHistory.\nParliamentary approval for a line from Wimbledon to Sutton had been obtained by the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (W&amp;SR) in 1910 but work had been delayed by World War I. From the W&amp;SR's inception, the District Railway (DR) was a shareholder of the company and had rights to run trains over the line when built. In the 1920s, the London Electric Railway (LER, precursor of London Underground) planned, through its ownership of the DR, to use part of the route for an extension of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR, now the Northern line) to Sutton. The SR objected and an agreement was reached that enabled the C&amp;SLR to extend as far as Morden in exchange for the LER giving up its rights over the W&amp;SR route. The SR subsequently built the line, one of the last to be built in the London area.\nWimbledon Chase station was not included in the original 1910 permission, stations at Elm Grove to the north and Cannon Hill to the south were planned, but were not constructed. The station opened on 7 July 1929 when the first section of the line to South Merton came into operation. The route opened to Sutton on 5 January 1930.\nServices.\nAll services at Wimbledon Chase are operated by Thameslink using EMUs.\nThe typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:\nA small number of late evening services are extended beyond St Albans City to and daytime services on Sundays are extended to .\nConnections.\nLondon Buses routes 152, 163, 164, K5 and 655 serve the station."

        "text": "Frederick Rankin Taylor (December 3, 1924 – January 6, 2002) was a college men's basketball coach for Ohio State University from 1959 to 1976. Prior to that, he played baseball for the Washington Senators.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from Lash High School in Zanesville in 1943, Taylor entered the United States Army Air Forces where he served from 1943 to 1946. Despite never having played high school basketball, he became a player at Ohio State and was the starting forward on the 1950 Big Ten Conference championship basketball team. Taylor learned to play basketball while in the Army Air Forces playing under Captain Rowland Wenzel going undefeated. In addition he was Ohio State University's first All-American baseball player. His number 27 is retired at Ohio State.\nProfessional baseball career.\nAfter graduating, Taylor signed as an amateur free agent with the baseball Washington Senators on June 6, 1950. Primarily a first baseman, he was assigned to the minor league Chattanooga Lookouts, where he batted .263 in 78 games. He made his major league debut on September 12, and played six games for the Senators.\nTaylor returned to Chattanooga in 1951, this time batting .291 in 152 games. He again earned a brief trial with the Senators, appearing in six more games. In 1952, he managed to play in ten games while again spending most of the season in the minors. After playing one more season with the independent Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League in 1953, he left baseball for good.\nCoaching career.\nAfter the end of his baseball career, Taylor returned to Ohio State as assistant basketball coach in 1958, becoming head coach the following year.\nDuring his 18 years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes won the 1960 NCAA championship, were runners-up in 1961 and 1962 to Cincinnati (as coached by Ed Jucker) and claimed a third-place finish in 1968. When Taylor made his third straight Final Four in 1962, he was only the third coach ever to reach three consecutive Final Fours after Phil Woolpert and Harold Olsen. His Final Four appearance in 1968 made him the sixth coach to reach that mark. The last time he coached the Buckeyes to an NCAA tournament appearance was in 1971, where Ohio State upset previously unbeaten Marquette in the Mideast Regional semifinal round. However, Western Kentucky beat OSU in the Mideast Regional round to advance to the Final Four. In his five NCAA tournament appearances, Taylor's teams went 14–4 and also won or shared seven Big Ten titles. In a three-year span (1960–62), his teams won 68 games in the regular season with four losses while going 10-2 in the NCAA Tournament. At one point in Taylor's tenure with the Buckeyes, the team won 32 straight games, and they once had a home winning streak of fifty games.\nTaylor finished his career with an overall record of 297–158 and was named Coach of the Year by the USBWA and UPI in 1961 and 1962. A talented recruiter, Taylor coached six All-Americans as well as Hall of Famers Jerry Lucas, John Havlicek and Bobby Knight.\nTaylor served as president of the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 1972 and was a member of the U.S. Olympic Basketball Committee from 1964 to 1972. He also served on the University Division of the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee for a number of years.\nRetirement.\nAfter retiring from coaching in 1976, Taylor managed the U.S. National Team in the 1978 FIBA World Championships and the 1979 Pan American Games. In addition, Taylor managed The Golf Club, a private golf course in New Albany, Ohio, for 18 years.\nIn addition, Taylor was a television analyst for college basketball on NBC, often paired with Merle Harmon, during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As players found themselves in precarious situations, Taylor often described them as, \"between a rock and a hard place.\"\nOn May 6, 1986, Taylor was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame, having previously been\nselected to the Ohio State Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame as part of the Charter Class of 2006."

        "text": "The men's time trial at the 2004 Summer Olympics (Cycling):\nMedalists.\nOf the top riders, it soon became clear that Sydney 2000 time trial gold medal winner Russian rider Viatcheslav Ekimov was setting the time to beat. The current world time trial champion, Michael Rogers from Australia, appeared to match Ekimov's times, but faded in the final kilometres. Tyler Hamilton, from the US, had problems with his radio shortly after the start, and rode the race effectively without radio communication. Hamilton finished strongly claiming the gold medal for the US, averaging 50.062 km/h to finish the 48 km course in 57:31.74. Ekimov was awarded the silver medal, with a time of 57:50.58 nearly 19 seconds behind Hamilton, with another American, Bobby Julich, in a time of 57:58.19 inching out Michael Rogers (58:01.67) for the bronze medal.\nMichael Rich (58:09.46) from Germany finished 37 seconds behind Hamilton for fifth, with Kazakhstan rider Alexander Vinokourov finishing sixth. The last person to start, the 2000 Olympics road race winner and former world time trial champion Jan Ullrich from Germany, could not match the pace and ended with a time of 59:02.04 in seventh position.\nOn 20 May 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that Hamilton returned his gold medal to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after Hamilton acknowledged to 60 Minutes that he used doping products during his career. The International Olympic Committee responded in August 2012 by stripping Hamilton of his medal.\nOn 5 September 2012, Random House (Bantam Books) published Hamilton's memoir \"The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs\", coauthored with American writer Daniel Coyle. It won the 2012 William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. In the book, he details his career and his relationship with Lance Armstrong, for whom he was a teammate and a confidant. It also details some of the doping practices he and Armstrong were using on the USP team, such as EPO injections and blood transfusions. They parted ways when Hamilton went riding for CSC. This decision was motivated by the fact that Armstrong had become cold and vindictive toward him. Hamilton then recounts the 2 years spent riding for Bjarne Riis, his sympathy for the former rider and how Riis introduced him to Eufemiano Fuentes, a Spanish doctor who would be later investigated in the Operacion Puerto doping affair. He then recounts his years on the Phonak Team when he tested positive during the Vuelta a España to an alleged homologous blood transfusion.\nDespite admitting throughout the work that he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions, Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in shambles, he raced for lesser teams after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal anti-depressant) and retired. He later received a call from United States federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who wanted to talk to him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he decided to tell everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward. Armstrong was also banned from bicycle racing and triathlon competition.\nResults.\n\"(DNS/F = Did Not Start/Finish)\""

        "text": "The men's points race in cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics consisted of a 160 lap (40 kilometre) points race with 16 sprints where points were awarded. The event was held on 24 August 2004 at the Athens Olympic Velodrome. There were 23 competitors from 23 nations, with each nation limited to one cyclist in the event. The event was won by Mikhail Ignatiev of Russia, the nation's first victory in the men's points race. Spain's Joan Llaneras, the defending champion, took silver; he was the first and only person (of any gender) to win multiple medals in the relatively short-lived points race, and ended with three medals after another gold in 2008. Guido Fulst of Germany took bronze, the first medal in the event for that nation since 1900.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event. It was first held in 1900 and not again until 1984; after that, it was held every Summer Games until 2008 when it was removed from the programme. The women's version was held from 1996 through 2008.\n8 of the 23 cyclists from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist Joan Llaneras of Spain, silver medalist Milton Wynants of Uruguay, sixth-place finisher Franz Stocher of Austria, eleventh-place finisher Wong Kam Po of Hong Kong, fourteenth-place finisher Juan Curuchet of Argentina, fifteenth-place finisher Matthew Gilmore of Belgium, sixteenth-place finisher Makoto Iijima of Japan, and seventeenth-place finisher Vasyl Yakovlev of Ukraine. Llaneras, Wynants, Stocher, Curuchet, and Yakovlev had all competed in 1996 as well; Yakovlev was on his fourth Games.\nLlaneras won the World Championships in 1996, 1998, and 2000. Chris Newton of Great Britain was the 2002 World Champion. Stocher won in 2003, with Llaneras in second. Franck Perque of France was the reigning (2004) champion.\nBelarus and the Czech Republic each made their debut in the event. France and Italy both competed for the seventh time, the only nations to have competed in all seven Olympic men's points races.\nCompetition format.\nThe format changed slightly from previous incarnations of the Olympic points race. The event was still a single race at 40 kilometres distance, with points for 16 sprints (every 2.5 kilometres). The scoring of laps changed, however. Rather than riders a lap behind the leaders being automatically placed behind them, and unable to score sprint points, now cyclists earned a 20-point bonus for each lap ahead. This bonus was large enough that it had largely the same result in practice.\n5 points were given to the first finisher of each sprint, with 3 going to the second-place finisher, 2 going to the third place cyclist, and 1 going to the fourth place rider. Cyclists could also score points by lapping the main body of riders, known as the peloton. 20 points were gained by doing this, while 20 points were lost if the peloton lapped the cyclist.\nResults.\nIgnatiev got a lap ahead of everyone else, giving him a 20-point advantage over the four-man chase group. Llaneras finished strong, winning 3 of the last 4 laps for 15 points. This gave him a total of 22 sprint points, most in the field and 9 more than Ignatiev, but the lap difference kept the Spaniard in second place."

Cyclists could also score points by lapping the main body of riders, known as the peloton. 20 points were gained by doing this, while 20 points were lost if the peloton lapped the cyclist.\nResults.\nRussian sprinter and 2004 Olympics road race bronze medallist, Olga Slyusareva, was able to win three of the ten sprints, and place in four other sprints to achieve 20 points. The peloton was able to respond to any breakaways so no riders were able to achieve lap points. Mexican rider Belem Guerrero Méndez with 14 points was awarded the silver medal, closely followed by Maria Luisa Calle Williams from Colombia on 12 points. Calle Williams later tested positive for banned stimulant heptaminol, and Erin Mirabella was promoted to the bronze medal position. That decision, however, was later reversed on appeal. As a result of the IOC's 24 October 2005 decision, Mirabella was ordered to return the bronze medal and diploma and Calle's third-place result, bronze medal and diploma were re-instated. \nNo cyclists gained points from lapping the peloton. Three lost a lap, however."

Since 1967, it has been in the rotation of the multi-course AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, a February tournament on the West Coast Swing of the PGA Tour.\nOriginally called Pebble Beach Pines Golf Club, it was renamed to Spyglass Hill by Samuel F. B. Morse (1885–1969), the founder of Pebble Beach Company, after the place in the 1883 novel \"Treasure Island\" by Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894), who had spent time in the Monterey area in 1879.

The first five holes all have views of the Pacific Ocean, and the other thirteen wind through the Del Monte Forest.\nThe course record of 62 (–10) was set by Phil Mickelson in 2005 and equaled by Luke Donald the next year; both were carded on Thursday of the AT&amp;T under calm conditions.\nThe back tees at Spyglass Hill were called \"Tiger tees\" when it opened, long before the birth of Tiger Woods.\nLayout.\nThe first hole is called Treasure Island, and is a downhill par 5, which doglegs almost 90 degrees to the left. One of the more renowned holes is the fourth, a par 4 named Blind Pew, which Robert Trent Jones called his favorite par 4. The green is the most photographed on the course, and is surrounded by ice plant. Other hole names include The Black Spot (3rd), Captain Flint (10th), and Long John Silver (14th)."

He played 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) after being selected by the Orlando Magic in the first round of the 2000 NBA draft with the fifth overall pick. Miller was named the NBA Rookie of the Year with the Magic in 2001 and was voted NBA Sixth Man of the Year with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2006. He won two consecutive NBA championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013.\nMiller played college basketball for the Florida Gators before entering the NBA. He also played professionally for the Minnesota Timberwolves, Washington Wizards, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Denver Nuggets. He was a swingman who was primarily a three-point specialist.\nAfter his playing career, he became a college assistant coach with the Memphis Tigers. He resigned after two seasons before becoming the head coach at Houston High. He coached Houston High to their first ever basketball state championship winning 62–43 on March 20, 2021.\nCollege career.\nMiller accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan's Gators teams from 1998 until 2000. He quickly became known for his ability to hit the three-pointer. As a sophomore, Miller helped the Gators avoid an upset bid by Butler in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, winning 69–68 in overtime on his floater in the lane as the buzzer sounded. This fueled the Gators' path to the 2000 NCAA Championship game, ultimately losing to Michigan State. After the 2000 NCAA Tournament, Miller declared himself eligible for the NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nOrlando Magic (2000–2003).\nThe following summer, Miller was taken with the fifth overall pick in the 2000 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic.

The two previous games Miller hit seven threes. This made him the first NBA player to hit at least seven three-pointers in three consecutive games since the Dallas Mavericks' George McCloud achieved it in 1996. Miller held the Memphis Grizzlies franchise record for most points scored in a single game, with 45 on February 21, 2007, against the Golden State Warriors. The record was later broken by Ja Morant in February 2022. After the 2006–07 NBA season, Miller was announced as a member of the USA Basketball team.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2008–2009).\nOn June 26, 2008, Miller, Brian Cardinal, Jason Collins, and the 5th pick of the 2008 NBA draft, Kevin Love, were sent to Minnesota in exchange for Marko Jarić, Antoine Walker, Greg Buckner and the 3rd pick, O.

Miller got his first start on January 22, 2011, due to a Dwyane Wade illness, and contributed with a season-high 32 points in a win over the Toronto Raptors. Miller averaged just 2.6 points a game in 12 minutes a game during the playoffs, with a high of 12 in game 4 against the Chicago Bulls.

On September 28, 2015, he was waived by the Trail Blazers via a contract buyout.\nDenver Nuggets (2015–2017).\nOn September 30, 2015, Miller signed with the Denver Nuggets. Miller was instrumental in the early development of teammate Nikola Jokić. The two players share a special friendship to go along with their mentor/mentee relationship and even share the same birthday. He re-signed with the Nuggets on July 21, 2016, and played 20 games with the team averaging 1 point, 2 rebounds and 1 assist.\nMiller's final NBA game was played on April 12, 2017, in a 111–105 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder where he recorded 8 rebounds and 4 assists, but no points. He was waived by the Denver Nuggets on July 11, 2017.\nCoaching career.\nOn April 12, 2018, Miller was hired as an assistant coach under Penny Hardaway at the University of Memphis.

In July, Miller was named the boys basketball coach at Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee. His sons Mason and Mavrick are players on the team.\nPersonal life.\nMiller and his wife, Jen, have three children: sons Mason and Mavrick, and a daughter Jaelyn. His daughter was born during the Heat's appearance in the with a serious health issue stemming from pregnancy complications; he spent the first several days of his daughter's life shuttling between practices, games, and the hospital. He once owned a Java macaque named Sonny. He often tells the story in which his monkey escaped from his room: \"You would always put him in his room, and then we'd lock the door, and then we'd put the dogs out, and then we'd lock the front door. Well, he found out how to unlock doors, unlocked his door, went downstairs, let the dogs in the house and opened the front door. About an hour later we got a call from our neighbors, saying, 'Your monkey is riding your dogs around the neighborhood.' ... I said, 'C'mon y'all, y'all got to get in the house.\"\nLet It Fly Energy.\nIn 2012, Miller founded the Let It Fly Energy line of energy drinks and energy shots. In a 2012 \"Forbes\" article, he said he started the company because he wanted a healthy alternative energy drink for athletes."

        "title": "Cross triathlon",
        "text": "Cross triathlon, or off-road triathlon, is a form of triathlon, or three-stage race, consisting of a swim stage, mountain-biking stage, and a trail-running stage.\nCross triathlons are distinguished from conventional triathlons in that the terrain for the cycling and running stages are generally unpaved, rough, and hilly. They require different techniques than conventional triathlon races, and in particular the athletes employ mountain bikes rather than road bikes.\nA cross triathlon requires a higher degree of technical biking skill, as opposed to the high speed and endurance demands of road biking in a road triathlon. Distances for the bike portion of an off-road are much less relevant than for a road triathlon. An off-road bike course may have several severe climbs and descents. It may also have a high degree of technicality, meaning the number, pitch and sharpness of turns through trees, rocks, logs, streams and other obstacles on the bike trail. Because the vertical climbs and technical demands of an off-road course greatly reduce a biker's speed, and because the amount of climbing and technicality vary greatly from one off-road course to another, estimating times for an off-road bike course merely by distance is not reliable.\nCross triathlon swim courses are normally similar to those of road triathlons. Each type of triathlon usually requires competitors to swim a minimum of 800 meters and typically 1500 meters in a lake, river or ocean.\nOff-road run courses often follow part of the off-road bike course, and so often require trail running up and down hills or mountain sides, through forests, streams, riverbeds and other natural and occasionally man-made obstacles. The run distance is at least 5 kilometers and normally 10 kilometers. Again, as in off-road biking, predicting a finish time purely based on distance will not be accurate, due to the climbing and trail turns and obstacles preventing a runner from reaching speeds usually achieved on the road.\nThe International Triathlon Union conducts an annual Cross Triathlon Championship race annually. Additionally, the XTERRA Triathlon is a private off-road series and concluding with a championship each year in Maui."

        "title": "Baseball Tonight",
        "text": "Baseball Tonight (stylized as Baseball Tonight presented by Chevrolet for sponsorship reasons) is an American television program that airs on ESPN. The show, which covers the day's Major League Baseball action, has been on the air since 1990. Its namesake program also airs on ESPN Radio at various times of the day during the baseball season, with Marc Kestecher as host.\n\"Baseball Tonight\" is also the title of a daily podcast hosted by Buster Olney with frequent appearances by Tim Kurkjian, Karl Ravech, and others from ESPN and more places.\nIn 2017, daily airing of the show, other than its Sunday airing, were replaced by MLB Network's \"Intentional Talk,\" which stopped airing on ESPN2 in December 2018 As of December 27, 2019, \"Baseball Tonight\" airs on Sundays before \"Sunday Night Baseball\", for major events such as the MLB All-Star Game, College World Series, MLB Postseason, and Winter Meetings, along with \"SportsCenter\" segments during the season.\nHistory.\nOn January 3, 2000, the segment \"Web Gems\" was coined and created by then-producer Judson Burch. The segment originally featured great defensive plays followed by viewer internet voting on the \"web.\" The phrase \"web gem\" is now common vernacular in baseball broadcasts and circles to describe outstanding glove-work.\nIn 2007, a new segment entitled \"That's Nasty!\" was introduced. The new segment featured top pitching performances of the day, including the best individual pitches. These clips often include extremely high velocity fastballs, 12–6 curveballs, or changeups that completely fool the opposing batters.\nIn 2013, Adnan Virk replaced Steve Berthiaume as one of the program's hosts, joining Karl Ravech.\nStarting in April 2017 the weekday and Saturday editions of \"Baseball Tonight\" was replaced by the MLB Network-produced program \"Intentional Talk\". In December 2018, four months before the deal to air \"Intentional Talk\" was to end in April 2019, the show stopped airing on ESPN2, with airings on MLB Network being unaffected. For the 2019 season, despite rumors of a return of the show daily, ESPN, just as they did the past two years, continued to only air \"Baseball Tonight\" sporadically throughout the season on Monday-Saturday, along with the weekly Sunday version \"Baseball Tonight: Sunday Night Countdown\" before \"Sunday Night Baseball\".\nAlso, a segment on \"SportsCenter\" known as the \"Baseball Tonight Report\" started, which aired all throughout the Major League Baseball season. During the Playoffs, Baseball Tonight goes back to its traditional daily airings on ESPN2.\nIn May 2017, as the result of major staff cuts implemented by ESPN (which saw the layoff of several ESPN baseball reporters), the network cancelled the weekday editions of \"Baseball Tonight\", leaving only the editions that are broadcast before \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and on special occasions such as the Little League World Series and during the postseason.\nIn January 2019, the network announced that \"Baseball Tonight\" would not return to the network's lineup as a part of its MLB coverage in 2019 as a daily show. The Sunday version, \"Baseball Tonight: Sunday Night Countdown\", still airs before every \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game.\nOn February 3, 2019, Adnan Virk was fired from ESPN for leaking confidential information, including the future of \"Baseball Tonight\", to the media, including Awful Announcing.\nAir times.\n\"Baseball Tonight\" appeared nightly on ESPN throughout the baseball season at 10:00 p.m. ET and 12:00 a.m. ET on ESPN2. The 10 PM show aired on ESPN2 in the event of a conflict. Following the cancellation of \"The Trifecta\" in late 2006, the 12:00 a.m. run of \"Baseball Tonight\" was expanded to a full 40 minutes. The show has permission from Major League Baseball to show in-progress highlights. The show was also seen at 12:30 p.m. ET and 7:00 p.m. ET on Sundays, the latter show leading up to the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" telecast.\nThe late-night edition on Sundays was usually just a re-air of the 7:00 show, with a \"SportsCenter\" anchor providing highlights of the Sunday night game in place of a game preview segment that airs during the live broadcast. The midnight edition usually re-aired at 12:00 p.m. ET the following day (excluding Saturday, when the show is usually 40 minutes to a full hour). That practice ended Monday August 11, 2008, when \"SportsCenter\" went to live editions in the mornings.\nLive, on-location episodes.\nThe show also appeared live at events throughout the year, such as spring training, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the World Series sites, at ESPN the Weekend, and occasionally had remote stunts, i.e. a show from the rooftop at Fenway Park and a show from one of the Wrigley Rooftops at Wrigley Field in 2005.\nIt aired live from the field at Fenway Park on April 26, 2009, before the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game between the Yankees–Red Sox game, which featured an interview with Dustin Pedroia. On June 28, 2009, it aired from Citi Field in anticipation of that night's Subway Series game between the Mets and the Yankees.\nDuring the 2019 season, \"Baseball Tonight\" went on-location for the defending World Series champions Boston Red Sox Home Opener, along with going to London, England for the New York Yankees vs the Boston Red Sox.\nFeatured segments.\n\"Baseball Tonight\" is split into a number of segments, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of baseball. These segments include:\nOne featured running gag on the show is the spoof segment \"Name That Molina\", where one of the personalities has to guess which of the three Molina catcher brothers – Bengie, Jose, or Yadier – is being shown. \"Name that LaRoche\" is another spoof segment featuring the two brothers who play for the Toronto Blue Jays Andy and the Washington Nationals Adam.\nAnother running gag is the Umpire Fantasy League in which \"owners\" of umpires in this fictitious league are rewarded for their umpires ejecting players or coaches. It is unclear whether this is reference to the real-life Umpire Ejection Fantasy League.\nAlso another gag in session is when an analyst on the show uses the \"Stump the host\" slogan. This is when the analyst has information on a certain players milestone that has just happened on the telecast. An example is when a player hits a home run, double, steals a base, or strikes someone out and the analyst will say \"Stump the Host; Career hr/strikeout/2-B/SB/etc. number __? The host very seldom knows the answer but will take a reasonable, and sometimes ludicrous, guess at what the answer might be. This gag is very seldom used but sometimes is quite comical for the fact that the host has no idea what the answer may be.\nLive look-ins.\nESPN is generally prohibited by Major League Baseball from showing live look-ins of in-progress games, and limited to showing in-progress highlights after they happen. However, an exception is made when there is an extraordinary event taking place, such as a no-hitter or perfect game, and ESPN is allowed to show live look-ins during \"Baseball Tonight\". Other circumstances include an ESPN-scheduled game which suffers a rain delay, or is completely rained out and postponed.\nCriticism.\nSome have criticized the program because of a perceived bias in favor of certain teams. The most vocal comment was expressed by Heath Bell:\nMedia.\nIn late 2012, mobile game company SkyZone Entertainment and TheAppsGames released \"ESPN Going Going Gone\", an arcade style home run derby game for both Android and iOS. The game features an intro and voice over by ESPN's Dan Shulman and ESPN trademark."

        "text": "Albert Lucas (September 1, 1978 – April 10, 2005) was an American football player in the National Football League (NFL) and Arena Football League (AFL) who died from a game-related spinal cord injury while playing for the Los Angeles Avengers.\nEarly life and college career.\nLucas was born in Macon, Georgia; his father was Georgia State Representative David Lucas and his mother was Macon City Councilwoman Elaine Lucas. He attended and played football for Northeast Health Science Magnet High School. While there, he set the school record with a 440-pound (200-kg) bench press. Nicknamed \"Big Luke\", he went on to play college football at Troy State University. Lucas also served as an assistant football coach at Northeast High. He was married to De'Shonda Lucas with one daughter, Mariah. He was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.\nAt Troy State, Lucas was a standout player. In his senior year (1999), he won the Buck Buchanan Award as the most outstanding defensive player in NCAA Division I-AA. He was also honored with unanimous All America and All-Southland Football League first-team selections that year, in which he compiled 126 tackles (twenty for losses), 15 \"quarterback hurries\", four sacks, and two forced fumbles.\nLucas played a total of 43 games for the Trojans, and finished his college career with 255 tackles (thirty-six for losses), 25 quarterback hurries, and 11.5 sacks. In addition, he saw some limited action at running back in his junior and senior seasons, scoring seven touchdowns.\nProfessional football career.\nNFL career.\nAfter making the team as an undrafted free agent, Lucas played in twenty games for the Carolina Panthers over the course of the 2000 and 2001 NFL seasons. He totaled 49.5 tackles, three quarterback hurries, two batted down passes, a forced fumble, and a sack. He was selected by the Frankfurt Galaxy with the fourth overall pick in the 2003 NFL Europa free-agent draft, but chose instead to begin his AFL career with the Tampa Bay Storm.\nAFL career.\nIn his rookie season with Tampa Bay, Lucas had an immediate impact on his new team. He had 19.5 tackles, three for losses, 1.5 sacks, a blocked kick, and a safety, and was a major factor in the Storm's ArenaBowl victory over the Arizona Rattlers. He was named to the AFL's All-Rookie team, and after that season, Lucas was one of the most sought-after free agents in the League, and signed a three-year contract with Los Angeles on October 27, 2003.\nIn the 2004 season, Lucas played in all 16 games for the Avengers and led the team's linemen with 18.5 tackles. He also had three quarterback sacks, three fumble recoveries (one for a touchdown), two batted down passes, a forced fumble, and a safety.\nDeath.\nOn April 10, 2005, in a game against the New York Dragons, Lucas tackled Corey Johnson during a kickoff return with 10:17 to go in the first quarter. Replays showed that Johnson's knee hit Lucas' helmet, and Lucas did not move again after falling to the ground. Later replays and reports showed nothing abnormal on the play. Dr. William Lang, the team physician, attempted to revive him on the field. He appeared to suffer a spinal cord injury. After being treated for approximately a half an hour at the Staples Center, Lucas was rushed to nearby California Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 1:28pm PDT. It is unknown whether Lucas died on the field, or after treatment failed. An autopsy revealed that he died of blunt force trauma and an upper spinal cord injury.\nApproximately half an hour after the game concluded, Lucas's death was confirmed by Avengers' primary team physician, Luga Podesta, who stated, \"During the game today, Al Lucas suffered a presumed spinal cord injury and was brought to California Hospital Medical Center where all attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. He was pronounced dead at 1:28 p.m.\"\nLegacy.\nThe Avengers retired Lucas's number 76 during the 2006 season and the Tampa Bay Storm created the Mariah Lucas Scholarship Fund to benefit Lucas's daughter and wife, and the Lucas family itself started an Al Lucas Memorial Scholarship Fund which provides college scholarships to high school athletes.\nThe Maxwell Football Club renamed its Arena Football League Player of the Year Award to the Al Lucas Award in honor of Lucas; this award was discontinued after the 2007 season. The East Macon Park Little League field where Lucas played baseball was renamed Albert James Lucas \"Big Luke\" Memorial Field in 2006, and the AFL has renamed its Hero Award the Al Lucas Award."

Gardner (March 29, 1910 – April 9, 2000) was an American college basketball coach, known for his tenures as the head coach at Kansas State University and the University of Utah. He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nBorn in Texico, New Mexico, Gardner was raised in southern California, and was a four-sport athlete in high school at Redlands. A graduate of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, he was the captain of the Trojan basketball team and led the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) in scoring. Gardner coached at Kansas State from 1939 to 1942 and 1946 to 1953, compiling a 147–81 record with the Wildcats, and thereafter coaching at Utah from 1953 to 1971, compiling a 339–154 record. His career college record was .\nIn his second stint at Kansas State, following World War II, Gardner's teams won three conference crowns and captured two Big Eight Holiday Tournament championships. His 1950–51 team finished 25–4 and lost in the finals of the NCAA tournament to the University of Kentucky. That team was arguably the best in K-State history, and one of two that reached the Final Four during his tenure (the other was in 1948). He had six All-Americans at Kansas State, including Ernie Barrett.\nGardner left Manhattan, Kansas, in 1953 to take over the head coaching reins at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, where he remained for 18 years. He led the Utes to six appearances in the NCAA tournament and two Final Four appearances (1961 &amp; 1966). To date, Gardner remains one of only three coaches to twice lead two different programs to the Final Four, along with Roy Williams and Rick Pitino, and won eight conference titles. Between 1959 and 1962, his teams compiled a record; Gardner was often referred to as \"The Fox\" and known for his fast-break style, putting the \"run\" into the \"Runnin' Utes.\" He had five All-Americans at Utah, including Billy \"The Hill\" McGill. \nGardner is a member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as well as ten other Halls of Fame. He was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2000 and is also a member of the Southern Utah Hall of Fame, Utah All-Sports Hall of Fame, State of Utah Basketball Hall of Fame, Helms Foundation Hall of Fame, Kansas State University Hall of Fame, Crimson Club (University of Utah), Modesto Junior College Hall of Fame, Redlands High School Hall of Fame, and College Basketball Hall of Fame. He was also the recipient of the National Association of Basketball Coaches' Golden Anniversary Award.\nGardner worked as a consultant for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1979 (when the team moved from New Orleans) until 1995. He is credited with discovering point guard John Stockton from Gonzaga University while working for the Jazz.\nGardner died at age 90 in 2000 in Salt Lake City."

        "text": "Gary Edward Smith (born February 4, 1944) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. Gary is a son of Des Smith and brother of Brian Smith, both former National Hockey League (NHL) players. Smith played for numerous clubs, including the Chicago Black Hawks, Oakland/California Seals, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, Washington Capitals and Winnipeg Jets. He was the co-winner of the Vezina Trophy in the 1971–72 NHL season.\nPlaying career.\nSmith played his junior hockey with the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, Toronto Neil McNeil Maroons and the Toronto Marlboros. He won a Memorial Cup with the Toronto Marlboros in 1964. Smith made his NHL debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1965-66 NHL season, and was one of five goalies who played for the Maple Leafs during 1966–67, their most recent Stanley Cup season.\nIn his first season with Toronto, Smith left his crease in a game against the Montreal Canadiens in an attempt to be the first NHL goalie to score a goal. He reached the Canadiens' blueline before J. C. Tremblay issued a heavy bodycheck. The NHL subsequently introduced a rule prohibiting the goaltender from being involved in play after crossing the center red line. On occasion, Smith continued to attempt to score from within his side of the red line.\nHe was eventually given the nickname \"Suitcase\" Smith by \"Toronto Star\" journalist Red Burnett due to the large number of teams for which he played. After playing with the dismal California Golden Seals from 1967–68 to 1970–71, with whom he set records in 1970–71 for both the most games played in a single season and most losses in a single season, his first success was sharing the 1971–72 Vezina Trophy with Tony Esposito while with the Chicago Black Hawks. One year later, Smith and Esposito helped lead the Black Hawks to the Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Montreal Canadiens in six games.\nIn 1974–75, he had a fine season with the Vancouver Canucks, with 72 games played and six shutouts. Smith finished fifth place in balloting for the 1975 Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player judged most valuable to his team. The ultimate winner, Bobby Clarke, said in his acceptance speech that Smith was more deserving of the award. The following season, after giving up five goals to the Pittsburgh Penguins, Smith was pulled from the game but rather than stay on the bench he left the Pacific Coliseum and drove home still wearing his equipment. He was suspended indefinitely by the team, later reduced to five games, and later said \"It's tough driving in your skates.\"\nSmith later played in the World Hockey Association (WHA), and was a teammate and roommate of Wayne Gretzky while playing for the Indianapolis Racers. He was part of the Winnipeg Jets' 1979 Avco World Trophy championship, won against the Edmonton Oilers, who were led by Gretzky. Coincidentally, when Gretzky attended his first NHL game at Maple Leaf Gardens, Smith played for the California Golden Seals against the Maple Leafs. Smith gave up the last goal in WHA history to Dave Semenko.\nSmith's last coach in Winnipeg was Tom McVie, who coached Smith the previous season while both were with the Washington Capitals.\nSmith was noted for his ritual of removing his entire uniform and goaltending gear between periods and putting it all back on again. He claimed his skate boots would stretch in size, forcing him to wear as many as 13 pairs of socks at times. He performed his undressing routine throughout his career as an active player, even after resolving his skate boot issues.\nSmith was also known for punting the puck down the ice, allegedly in at attempt to hit the scoreclock.\nPersonal life.\nHis brother Brian was also a professional hockey player, and on December 19, 1967 Brian's Los Angeles Kings played Gary's Oakland Seals, and Gary gave up two goals to his brother. Brian later became a television sports news anchor in Ottawa, until he was murdered in 1995. In 1996 Gary, at the time a process server in Vancouver, was one of many former players who received a court settlement for pension payments owed by the league, and announced his intention to purchase a racehorse he would name Broadcaster, in honour of his brother.\nGary currently resides in Del Mar, California and continues to manage his horses."

        "text": "American football positions have slowly evolved over the history of the sport. From its origins in early rugby football to the modern game, the names and roles of various positions have changed greatly, some positions no longer exist, and others have been created to fill new roles.\nOrigins in rugby.\nBeing variants of 19th century rugby football, American and Canadian football position nomenclature has its origin there. Early rugby did no more than distinguish in tactics between the great bulk of the players who played as forwards, and the relative few who played back defensively as \"tends\", as in goaltenders. After a while, the attacking or at least counterattacking possibilities of playing close behind the scrimmage (which later came to be called \"scrummage\") came to be recognized, and some players stationed themselves between the forwards and tend as \"half-tends\". It was seen that the players outside scrimmage (the \"pack\", i.e. the forwards) were not limited to a defensive role, the tends and half-tends were renamed \"back\" and \"half back\" positions.\nAs the game advanced, backs positioned at different depths (i.e. distances behind the forwards) were further differentiated into separate positions. These positions were called halfback, three-quarters back, and full back according to English and Scottish nomenclature and quarterback, halfback, and full back in the Irish nomenclature. In rugby the English-Scottish nomenclature was eventually adopted worldwide, with the word, \"back\", often omitted for brevity from the half-back (\"half\") and three-quarters back (\"three quarter\") names, and \"fullback\" as a single word.\nIn some systems, \"five-eighths back\" was added. (The illustration here, of singular forms, should not be construed as indicating the number of players in any of those positions, nor is the fraction in the name at all proportional to the actual depth of the position; they indicate only a form of ordinal number, not cardinality.) Having the backs at different depths facilitates passing movements in which the ball is tossed from one player to (usually) the next closest, such that each back receiving the ball, in turn, can be running forward and yet not ahead of the player who threw it, since forward passing of the ball is illegal. Because of the involvement of the 3/4 backs, such a movement is often called a three-quarters movement.\nIt was the Irish nomenclature of quarter back, half back, and full back that came to North America for use in what was to become the dominant native form of football. The terms became hyphenated and eventually unhyphenated single words, \"quarterback\" (QB), \"halfback\" (HB), and \"fullback\" (FB). The lack of quarterback in the English-Scottish nomenclature for rugby led to the position name \"scrum-half\" to distinguish the halfback playing close to scrimmage (renamed \"scrummage\" or \"scrum\") from another who would \"stand off\" from it or \"fly\" away—the \"stand-off\" or \"fly-half\".\nEarly Canadian football.\nAround 1900, at the same time, the number of players on a Canadian football team was reduced to 14, and the number of players in scrimmage (formerly packing all the forwards) was fixed at three per team. It became customary for six to eight of the other players to continue as what might be known in rugby as loose (non-packing, i.e. not binding together) forwards who in Canadian football formed \"winglines\" on either side of the scrimmage. In scrimmage, each team had one centre scrimmager flanked by two side scrimmagers. The side scrimmager is bound with hands and arms to their centre scrimmager. The centre scrimmager of the side entitled (and required) to do so would put the ball down in front of him for play-by scrimmage, while both sets of three bodies each (\"formed into one compact body\" as the rules specified) were crouched and shoving forward at each other, probably meeting at the shoulders as do the front row of forwards in rugby's set scrummage. Depending on the rules, details of the time for the particular circuit of Canadian football clubs, the centre scrimmagers would either contend with their feet for the ball, or one would be entitled to foot it first (usually heeling it back), while the other teams would try to spoil the ball's delivery.\nThe backfield of three to five players continued to use the nomenclature (see above) of quarterback, halfback, and fullback, and sometimes included one or two flying wings. When six played on the winglines, their positions were called \"inside wing\", \"middle wing\", and \"outside wing\", arrayed in order away from the scrimmage. An additional player called \"flying wing\" could \"fly\", between a position on the wingline outside the outside wing, and the backfield.\nHowever, the 14-a-side game's rules never required certain numbers of players in either the winglines or the backfield.\nWith the later reduction in sides from 14 to 12 players, and introduction of the thrown snap (not footed) snap, the positions of the three scrimmagers were replaced by a single position called \"snap\". The position names in the winglines were retained for a while but eventually replaced by the American nomenclature, although it was not until the 1960s, that Canadian rules required seven players on the offensive line, unless they were playing short handed. Before that, only five were required on plays in which no forward pass was thrown, so it is likely that in such situations, one or both ends were replaced by or became a back. \"Snap\" became \"centre\" and considered a wingline or line position. \"Centre\" even became the rule book designation of the snapper, although as in the American version, there is no necessity that the player who snaps the ball have equal numbers of teammates flanking him or her on the line.\nMore position names.\nA tendency was seen, from early on, for players to keep their position names even when playing out of that position. For instance, before the minimum number of players on the offensive line was fixed at seven when players who would otherwise be in the line as guards or tackles played from offensive backfield positions, the formation was known as a \"guard(s) back\" or \"tackle(s) back\" formation.\nMeanwhile, another position name was introduced. Players were placed in the offensive backfield just outside their ends, in a position that came to be called \"wingback\" (WB). Formations with one or two wingbacks came to be called single- or double-wing formations.\nOver time, the typically fast back who played fullback, on offense and defense, was replaced by a heavier one who presented a greater threat to run with the ball more or less straight ahead, and to tackle his opponent trying to do the same. For this purpose, the player tended to be placed closer to the line than previously—often as far forward as the halfbacks (the offensive backs then forming a letter T, sometimes called a \"straight T\", later to distinguish it from slight variants wherein other backs did not form a line perpendicular to that from the quarterback) or even farther forward. But the position kept being called \"fullback\". On defense, this necessitated another position name for the fastback who played farthest back. The phrase \"goal-tend\" was used for a time near the start of the 20th century before settling upon \"safety man\" or simply \"safety\" (S), representing the last defense against a breakaway play, and the position from which to field opposing kicks. Approximately, on defense, the quarterback and fullback exchanged positions from what they'd been playing on offense, and the quarterback became the safety.\nStill, when at the beginning of the 20th century, a penalty was introduced for hitting the opposing kicker after a kick, the foul was at first called \"running into the fullback\", inasmuch as the deepest back usually did the kicking.\nConfusion increased when the legalization of the forward pass made it more advisable for teams to defend with fewer on the line of scrimmage and more behind. Although the offense could no longer play \"guard back\", for instance, the defense had no such limitations. A common defensive formation was the 6-2-3 or 6-2-2-1, shown below arrayed against an offense's straight T:\n S\n HB HB\n C FB\n ____E_ T__ _G ____G_ T _ E____\n E T G C G T E\n QB\n HB FB HB\nThe so-called center and fullback are playing left and right versions of the same position. The positions were later renamed \"linebacker\". However, that did not become the usual way to name that position until platoon football became common, with players specializing in offense or defense, substituted according to which team has the ball. There seems to have been some tendency for defensive positions to be named for where the player would play on offense, although quarterback and safety formed an early exception.\nWhen linebackers are playing close to or level with the line, a somewhat reliable way to distinguish them from line players is that the defensive line players will be in a three- or four-point stance, meaning that they will be supported by one or both hands, in addition to feet on the ground, while the linebackers will have only feet on the ground. Line players with one or both hands on the ground are called \"down linemen\"; typically all defensive linemen are so positioned.\nAlternate position naming schemes for an offensive formation are illustrated below in a version of a single-wing formation:\n E G C G T T E QB\n HB HB FB\n E T C G G T E QB\n FB WB TB\nIn the top illustration the center is flanked by guards in the 4-2 unbalanced line (four players on one side, the \"strong side\" of the center, two on the other, \"weak\", side) as in a balanced line, leaving the tackles together. In the bottom illustration, the guards are kept \"inside\" by being next to each other. The end positions are fixed by rule, because \"end\" is a rule book term.\nAs to the backfield, the top illustration preserves the principle of the names, reflecting distance from the line. However, the bottom illustration needs further explanation, having eliminated the halfbacks and introduced a new position name, \"tailback\" (TB). Wingback has been described above, but the \"WB\" in the above illustration is deeper back than that position name would seem to warrant. That is because this is a \"wingback deep\" version of the single wing, and the position is named wingback because the player is named for his true wingback position as it exists in other versions. In this version the player may stand as deep as any other back, but there has been a reluctance to identify formations in American football as having more than one fullback (or tailback—see below), although two-fullback systems were not uncommon at one time in rugby.\nWhat to make of the replacement of the other halfback from the top illustration by the fullback in the bottom one? Well, if the wingback were playing in a true wingback position but named halfback, then the other \"halfback\" would be playing deeper and thus deserve the name fullback. Another justification is that the player positioned as the left halfback in the top illustration tends to have the fullback characteristics described above. But rather than call the faster, lighter back behind (and in this formation, to the left of) him a halfback and so contradict the distance-back-determines-the-name principle (and rather than add rugby's three-quarters back), we call that player \"tailback\"—the tail of the formation, farther back than the fullback. Even when two players positioned to take a thrown snap in a single wing formation are level with each other (i.e. at equal depth), the faster one (usually playing weak side) is often called the tailback and the more massive one the fullback.\nThe quarterback in this formation is not in position to receive the snap. ASCII art (letter diagrams) cannot show this fine a detail, but a quarterback in position to take a handed snap is allowed by rule to stand farther forward, in a place which would otherwise cause illegal confusion as to whether the player was in the backfield or the line. However, the popularity of thrown-snap formations from about 1920 to about 1950 (and the illegality of the handed snap in Canadian football when snapping by hand rather than foot was first prescribed in that game) induced some teams to place the quarterback a little farther back, receiving the snap via a short toss.\nEven ASCII art is subtle enough to show the left end above a little farther from the nearest other line player of the same team than is the right end. Such a slight additional gap is said to be \"flexing\" that end, but does not produce an additional position name. However, when the gap is considerably greater, that is said to be a \"split end\" (SE). That produced a position name when on offense a team played with one end split and the other not split—a \"tight end\" (TE). The split end being specialized for going downfield to catch forward passes, it becomes more useful to differentiate the split from the tight end than between left and right end.\nInstead of wingbacks or conventionally placed halfbacks, an offensive team could have backs positioned wide of the rest of the formation, similarly to a split end, to be pass receivers. Such a back would be called a \"flankerback\" or \"flanker\" (FL).\nA more straightforward use of the position name, \"tailback\", is shown below in an offensive short punt formation, whose use, despite its name, is not confined to punting. The line shown is balanced with one split end. In such a case, the side with the tight end is sometimes said to be the strong side of the line, and hence of the formation, because the tight end is better placed than the split end to block, especially on running plays. An additional justification for calling that the strong side in the example below is that the backfield has more players on that side, although that will not always be the case, and in this case the positioning of backs does not produce strikingly strong and weak sides, as opposed to the single wing formation shown above.\n SE T G C G T TE QB HB HB TB\nIf the deepest back were a specialist in punting, one might substitute \"P\" for \"punter\" for the \"TB\" above.\nAge of confusion.\nThe trend of naming offensive positions for the role or build of player in it continued. In some cases, this obfuscates important details. A recent diagram of a short punt formation for offense in youth football had no quarterback, but two fullbacks at the depth of the QB shown above, and a halfback at the position labeled FB above. Some discussions of the single wing previously diagrammed claim it has no quarterback. And many is the time when a player in the farthest back position, in a formation similar to the short punt shown above, is referred to as quarterback! Position names no longer needed to reflect any given player's combined roles on offense and defense when few played both ways. As a result, position naming on defense has become less confusing and more informative. However, position naming on offense, while tending to eliminate obsolete distinctions, has also tended to hide important ones and confuse others.\nOffenses and defenses continued to adapt to the increases in forward passing favored by the rules. Below is diagrammed a 3-4-4 (or simply \"3-4\") defensive formation and an offensive formation it might line up against across the lines of scrimmage, as popular beginning in later portions of the 20th century:\n FS SSCB CB OLB ILB ILB OLB__________________E_______NT______E___________________WR T G C G T TE QB WR RB RB\nBeginning with the defensive line, one notices a slight departure from previous nomenclature with the position labeled \"NT\". Why not simply \"T\"? The superfluous designator \"middle\" when the defense was playing with an odd number on the line less than seven, as in \"middle guard\", was discussed above. (This invites the unanswered question of whether, if the defense has an eight-player line, it includes a \"left center\" and \"right center\".) \"NT\" stands for \"nose tackle\", \"nose\" having been introduced with guards to indicate a position \"on the nose\" of the opposing center, although \"nose guard\" had not been a popular term, probably because it suggested a piece of protective equipment. There is justification for the extra word, in that the tackle in a 3-player defensive line could well play off center; however, this distinction is not maintained with teams using such a tactic, so the position could and probably should be referred to simply as \"tackle\"—or \"defensive tackle\" (DT) in a player roster (see below).\nThe linebacker (LB) positions are straightforwardly distinguished as inside (ILB) and outside (OLB). When there are only three linebackers, the one inside is labeled middle linebacker (MLB), and the outside positions can instead be named as left and right.\nThe defense's halfbacks have been renamed cornerbacks (CB), a fitting term given that they play at the edges or \"corners\". The term has no spurious indicator of the depth at which they are positioned in the defensive backfield.\nFinally there are shown two safeties. In this case they are distinguished as \"free safety\" (FS)—also known as \"weak safety\"—and \"strong safety\" (SS). The strong safety is on the side following the strong (tight end) side of the balanced offensive line (see above), and has responsibility for covering (guarding as a pass receiver) the TE, while the free safety has no such coverage assignment. However, the coverage played by defense does not always easily allow assignment of such distinct names for safeties. A formation with more than two safeties could have them described by their relative geometric placement—outside, shallow, deep, etc.-but such is not general practice; however, see the discussion of the \"nickel\" below.\nThe offense is diagrammed in what was for some time referred to as a \"pro set\"-- \"set\" indicating that the players are stationary, although one back may go in motion from it. This particular version is said to have a \"deuce\", \"flank\" backfield. From the description above of the straight T, this formation can be seen to be derived by splitting one end and moving the halfback on the opposite side to a flanker position. Instead of \"SE\" and \"FL\" for those positions, however, we see \"WR\", for \"wide receiver\".\nIn the 1960s, teams would distinguish between split ends (e.g. the New York Jets professional football club's George Sauer) and flankers (e.g. his teammate, Don Maynard) on their player rosters. For a relatively brief period, game rules had been adopted in some codes, requiring different uniform numbers for line players from those of backs, and the position naming distinction carried on for a while after the rules were amended to require only certain sets of numbers for ineligible and eligible receivers of forward passes. It became commonplace for ends to shift into backfield positions and vice versa. By the 1970s, the common practice changed to refer to flankers and split ends both as wide receivers or, more colloquially, \"wideouts\"—they play from wide of the rest of the formation.\nThe playing rules still distinguish between ends and backs on offense. There are differences as to the motions, the players in those positions are allowed to make, during and preparatory to their team's snapping the ball. At the time they snap the ball, the team is required to have seven players (minus any number their side is playing short in Canadian football) on their line of scrimmage, which includes split or tight ends, but not flankers or wingbacks.\nMeanwhile, the distinction between fullback and halfback was erased, each replaced by \"running back\" (RB). That term became popular during the 1960s as well, although even into the 1970s, some playing the pro set kept the HB-FB distinction. So, for instance, in the flank formation shown above, those positions were named as in the straight T, while in the \"split\" version of the deuce backfield, the fullback occupied the other halfback position shown in the straight T. The distinction referred to the build of the players, the fullback being a stronger runner more or less straight ahead, and the halfback faster to attack the defense's flanks. However, on many teams there was no strong distinction between those backs, and since their major role was running with the ball, \"running back\" was most descriptive without maintaining a spurious geometric connotation that'd become outmoded by their lining up in different depth relationships.\nAlternative names for RBs are \"deep backs\" and \"setbacks\", although the latter is disfavored because it has also been used for backs in general, both on offense and defense. There is, moreover, a generic term for the deeper-playing backs (CB &amp; S) on defense: \"defensive back\" (DB), appropriately enough. The term excludes the linebackers, even though they be backs in the traditional sense because they are usually not on their team's line of scrimmage. There also exist the generic terms \"defensive lineman\" (DL) and \"offensive lineman\" (OL), although the latter refers only to the interior linemen, excluding the ends because of their eligibility to receive forward passes.\nHowever, to this day many teams maintain the offense's fullback-halfback distinction, especially in \"full house\" backfields, i.e. those with a quarterback and three running backs, that is, no backs playing wider as wingbacks or flankers. This is confusing enough, when the fullback plays slightly forward of the halfbacks, as in the Y formation shown below, later used to run the wishbone system (the backs forming a letter Y or a resemblance to a wishbone):\n E T G C G T E QB FB HB HB\nAt least, that one is an easy enough derivation to visualize from the original diamond, with the depth of the fullback inverted with respect to the halves. However, some formations have placed the heavy back even more starkly forward, to function as a blocker for the running backs. In the diagram below of the V formation used by Dartmouth College in the 1950s, the respective position names have been rationalized as \"BB\" (a not-very-popular designation, \"blocking back\") and RB:\n E T G C G T E QB BB RB RB\n(The running and blocking backs can be seen to form a letter V.) However, in its time the running backs were known as halfbacks and the blocking back as fullback. Another such example is the I formation, shown below in a with-wingback version:\n WR T G C G T TE WB QB FB TB\nThe diagram shows the more geometrically rational designation of tailback behind the fullback. However, some would label the deepest back in this form of deuce backfield \"HB\", considering one halfback to have moved behind the fullback, who is in both the role of blocking back and the heavy up-the-middle runner. Those who would emphasize the blocking role of the FB (the \"up back\") might even label the deepest back, \"RB\", with a BB instead of FB. Few, however, would use the straightforwardly geometric labels of QB, HB, and FB in that order from front to back.\nThe wingback is on the wing of a tackle rather than an end. This is accepted nomenclature where an end is split (\"WR\" above). The wingback is just behind and outside of the \"interior lineman\" (line player other than end). However, it is not uncommon for a wingback to be outside the tight end in an I or other formation where the opposite end is split.\nIn the power I formation, instead of the wingback shown above, there is another deep back in the traditional halfback position. That position in the power I is probably called \"halfback\" more than any other name. In the triple I, where all the backs are in one line perpendicular to the lines of scrimmage, one could hope for the backs to be called quarter-, half-, full-, and tailback in order of depth, but various names are probably used.\nThe diagram below of an \"ace\" formation deliberately mixes terms/symbols for wide receivers:\n E T G C G T WR SB QB WR RB\nOn the left are represented the more traditional and descriptive terms \"end\" and \"slotback\" (SB). The latter is for a position that would be labeled \"FL\", except that the back is in a \"slot\" between tackle and end (instead of outside of the end), here illustrating a double \"wide slot\" formation. (It is wide because the end is fully split, rather than merely flexed—see above.) There being no tight end, there seems to be no need to label either end as split; both are. But on the right, the slotback and end positions are merely labeled as wide receivers. The single running back here is shown to one side of the center-quarterback combination, but that \"ace\" RB could as well be directly behind them.\nIn some cases, the specific terminology of certain coaches has made its way into the general parlance. Coaches, having no motivation to publicize their plans, usually adopt cryptic codes for certain positions, using letters, numbers, or short names for their convenience. One set of designations which has been making the rounds, as of this writing on Web sites, purporting to explain football is the letters X, Y, and Z to designate receivers. It is doubtful that many coaches agree on the use of these terms to designate specific positions consistently from play to play, and those letters do not seem to enlighten but only to obscure. (One manual for football spectators, in the 1960s, explained that someone calling offensive plays in the huddle would point to primary, secondary, and tertiary receivers while giving them those letters; those designations would vary depending on the play, not on the positions those receivers occupied.) However, one such letter designation has caught on recently: \"H-back\", illustrated in the offensive formation below:\n E T G C G T E QB WB HB RB\nHere the H-back is represented by the symbol, appropriately enough, \"HB\". The H-back position is like that of the \"wingback deep\" position previously described in a version of the single wing formation, and here is shown behind a wingback to emphasize that, although more often the H-back and wingback, if there is one, are on opposite sides of the set. It is possible to say the abbreviation \"HB\" is already taken up by the halfback. The H-back does occupy a position about the same as the halfback in the diamond formation of the 19th century. It is likely that \"H-back\" is a term derived by back formation (pun unavoidable) from the abbreviation for halfback, although arbitrary letter designation by some coach is just as good an explanation.\nYou may see an offensive formation like that below, described as one of three tight ends:\n E T G C G T E QB WB RB RB\nHowever, it is labeled above as a version of the wing T, i.e. a T formation wherein one deep back has been replaced by a wingback. The description of its having three tight ends is absurd, inasmuch as a line can have only two ends, but comes about when the wingback position is occupied by a player most suited to blocking who otherwise usually plays tight end. If the extra blocker up front is actually in a line position, then, considering that a potential eligible receiver is being sacrificed, it would be better to conceive the formation as having an extra tackle or guard:\n E T G C G T T E QB RB RB\nIn the same vein as a formation's supposedly having three tight ends, examine the shotgun formation below. This is similar to the short punt formation shown previously, except that potential forward pass receivers are more widely spread. It is therefore, like the double wide slot offensive formation shown previously, a type of spread formation:\n WR T G C G T WR WB WB WR TB\nHowever, many would label the tailback above as quarterback, even though the position is clearly the deepest back! Until 1960, the formation above would have been called a double wing, and the tailback labeled a fullback, there being no need for the tailback designation when the backs assume so few intermediate depths. However, the deep back position above is usually occupied by a player who habitually plays QB, so the habitual position name tends to stick, as with the \"extra tight end\".\nThe identification engendered by the T formation of quarterback as someone who takes the snap is so strong nowadays that some describe the single wing formation diagrammed previously (under \"more position names\"), wherein the quarterback is positioned behind other interior line players than the center (and therefore cannot conveniently receive the snap), as having no quarterback! Such descriptions may have the QB as BB, although the system used may involve that player considerably as a ballcarrier or receiver, not just a blocker.\nOn defense meanwhile, an opposite philosophy to position naming is sometimes followed from that of the supposed third offensive end. Instead of the position name following the player to a different position, a new position name may be applied in such a substitution situation. This occurs when a team that usually uses four defensive backs (counting cornerbacks and safeties) adds a fifth, thus producing the \"nickel\" defense (a nickel being a 5 cent piece). It will be said that the extra DB is the \"nickel back\", even though coverage assignments will be redistributed, and therefore no particular DB is functionally or positionally in a \"nickel\" position, distinct from the other four. Nor, if a sixth DB is added, could one distinguish between the \"nickel\" and the \"dime\" back. However, if they are subbed in one at a time, an observer may apply \"seniority\" in naming one \"nickel\", etc. A roster will usually simply list such players as S, CB, or simply DB."

        "title": "1972–73 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1972 season began on December 23, 1972. The postseason tournament concluded with the Miami Dolphins defeating the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII, 14–7, on January 14, 1973, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California, becoming the only NFL team to finish a championship season undefeated and untied.\nLike the previous NFL seasons, the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly divisional rotation, excluding the wild card teams who would always play on the road and would not play against their own division champion in the playoffs unless they both made it to the Conference Championship, they would not be paired with each other in the first round.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, CBS televised the NFC playoff games, while NBC broadcast the AFC games and Super Bowl VII.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 23, 1972.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 13, Oakland Raiders 7.\nSteelers fullback Franco Harris scored the winning touchdown on what became known as the Immaculate Reception. In a game that was mostly dominated by defense, the contest remained scoreless throughout the first half. On the opening drive of the second half, Pittsburgh drove 67 yards to take a 3–0 lead on Roy Gerela's 18-yard field goal. Following two Raiders drives that were shut down by Jack Ham's interception and a fumble recovery by Glen Edwards, Steelers safety Mike Wagner fell on a fumble by quarterback Ken Stabler (who had replaced injured starter Daryle Lamonica earlier in the game) at the Oakland 35. Five plays later, Gerela kicked a 29-yard field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 6–0 lead in the fourth quarter. Stabler responded by leading his team 80 yards to score on a 30-yard touchdown run with 1:13 left in the game.\nFacing fourth and ten on their own 40-yard line with 22 seconds left, Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw the ball toward running back John \"Frenchy\" Fuqua. But the pass bounced off Raiders safety Jack Tatum and was caught by Harris, who then ran the rest of the way downfield to score a 60-yard touchdown that helped give the Steelers a 13–7 lead with five seconds left in the game. The play was controversial, as Tatum insisted the ball had bounced off Fuqua, not himself, which would have made the reception illegal under the rules of the time. Replays showing the play are inconclusive as to which player touched the ball (or if both of them did)\nHarris was the sole offensive star of the game, rushing for 64 yards and catching 4 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown. The Raiders managed just 216 yards and started 8 of their 12 drives inside their own 22-yard line, mainly due to excellent punting from Pittsburgh's Bobby Walden, who averaged over 48 yards per punt on his 6 kicks and set AFC playoff records with punts of 62 and 59 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Raiders and Steelers. Both teams would go on to build a heated rivalry, facing each other in the postseason five times in the 1970s alone.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 30, San Francisco 49ers 28.\nBackup quarterback Roger Staubach replaced ineffective Craig Morton and led the Cowboys to score 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to overcome a 28–13 San Francisco lead and five turnovers. This was the third consecutive year Dallas eliminated San Francisco from the playoffs.\nThe 49ers jumped to a 7–0 early lead when Vic Washington returned the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown. Dallas cut the deficit to 7–3 with kicker Toni Fritsch's 37-yard field goal. In the second quarter, 49ers receiver Gene Washington's 52-yard reception moved the ball deep into Dallas territory, only to have Cowboys cornerback Charlie Waters end the drive with an interception on the 1-yard line. But shortly after the turnover, Dallas quarterback Craig Morton lost a fumble while being hit by Windlan Hall and Tommy Hart, which linebacker Ed Beard recovered on the Cowboys 15-yard line. This led to Larry Schreiber's 1-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–3. Later in the quarter, Morton was intercepted by linebacker Skip Vanderbundt on the Dallas 32, setting up Schreiber's second rushing touchdown that increased the lead to 21–3. But Morton rallied his team back with 10 unanswered points, Fritsch's 45-yard field goal and Lance Alworth's 28-yard touchdown reception, cutting the deficit to 21–13.\nIn the second half, the Niners blew a chance to increase their lead when Bruce Gossett missed a 40-yard field goal attempt, but then got the ball back on Vanderbundt's second interception. Dallas managed to force a punt, which Jim McCann sent out of bounds at the Cowboys 5-yard line. A few plays later, defensive tackle Charlie Krueger stripped the ball from running back Calvin Hill on the 1 and the 49ers recovered, leading to Schreiber's third 1-yard touchdown run giving his team a commanding 28–13 lead.\nShortly before the end of the third quarter, coach Tom Landry replaced Morton with Roger Staubach, but it didn't seem to help. On his first drive, Staubach lost a fumble while being tackled by Bob Hoskins. San Francisco was in prime position to put the game away with another score, but they couldn't get the ball into the end zone and Gossett missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, causing a huge reversal of momentum. Now with the ball, Hill ripped off a 48-yard gain on a draw play to set up Fritsch's 27-yard field goal, trimming the lead to 28–16. Later in the quarter, a poor punt from McCann gave Dallas the ball at the 49ers 45-yard line. Staubach then led the team to the end zone, completing two passes to fullback Walt Garrison for 16 yards and two more to Billy Parks, the second a 20-yard touchdown completion to cut the score to 28–23 with less than two minutes left.\nWith time running out, Dallas had to attempt an onside kick. 49ers receiver Preston Riley briefly handled the ball, but couldn't hang on and it was recovered by Mel Renfro. On the first play after the recovery, Staubach gained 21 yards on a quarterback scramble. Then he connected for a 19-yard gain to Parks, who ran out of bounds at the San Francisco 10-yard line. On the next play, Staubach threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ron Sellers, giving Dallas a 30–28 lead with just 52 seconds left. However, the 49ers were not quite out of the game. Needing only a field goal to win, Brodie completed three consecutive passes, but a 23-yard completion to Riley that would have put the 49ers in field goal range was eliminated by a holding penalty, and Brodie was intercepted by Waters on the next play.\nThis game would mark the end of the four-year battle for the starting quarterback position on Dallas between Morton and Staubach. With his outstanding performance of 12/20 completions for 172 yards and 2 touchdowns, with no interceptions and 23 rushing yards in just over one quarter of play, Staubach became the Cowboys' permanent starter and would not relinquish the position until the end of his career after the 1979 season, while Morton was traded to the New York Giants in 1974 and later became the starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos. Morton and Staubach would later meet again and face off against each other in Super Bowl XII. The 49ers would not return to postseason play until 1981.\nDallas' comeback from an 18-point deficit was the second largest comeback in NFL postseason history at the time. The Cowboys outgained the 49ers in total yards 402–255, and first downs 22–13, although they lost five turnovers and their quarterbacks were sacked five times. Brodie was not sacked at all. Hill finished the game with a career postseason high 125 rushing yards, and one reception for six yards. Parks caught 7 passes for 136 yards. Vic Washington had 200 all-purpose yards (3 KR for 136 yards, 56 rushing yards, 1 rec for 8 yards) Defensive end Cedrick Hardman had 3.5 sacks.\nThis was the third overall postseason meeting, and third such meeting in as many years between the Cowboys and 49ers. Both previous meetings had been in the NFC Championship Game, and were both won by Dallas.\nSunday, December 24, 1972.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 16, Green Bay Packers 3.\nUsing a five-man defensive line, the Redskins limited the Packers to only a field goal and held Green Bay running back John Brockington (who rushed for 1,027 yards during the season) to just 9 yards on 13 carries. Meanwhile, Washington kicker Curt Knight scored 3 field goals, while running back 1972 NFL MVP Larry Brown, who had missed the last two games of the season with a knee injury, returned to rush for 101 yards, his 7th 100-yard game of the year.\nThe Packers scored first after a 23-yard completion from Scott Hunter to John Staggers set up Chester Marcol's 17-yard field goal in the second quarter, which ended up being only time in the entire game the Packers would cross Washington's 40-yard line. But then Redskins running back Herbert Mul-Key returned their kickoff 42 yards to Washington 40-yard line. The Redskins went on to drive 60 yards and score on Billy Kilmer's 32-yard touchdown pass to Roy Jefferson. With 33 seconds left in the first half, Knight kicked a 42-yard field goal to give Washington a 10–3 halftime lead. The Redskins then dominated the second half, with Knight adding two more field goals, the second one a 46-yard kick at the end of a 43-yard drive in which Brown rushed 6 times for 32 yards.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Packers and Redskins. Green Bay won the only prior meeting when the Redskins were based in Boston.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 20, Cleveland Browns 14.\nDespite being 13-point favorites, Miami found themselves trailing 14-13 midway through the 4th quarter due to a Browns touchdown drive. The Dolphins proved up to the challenge, as they responded by driving 80 yards to retake the lead on an 8-yard rushing touchdown by Jim Kiick with less than 5 minutes left in regulation to keep the Dolphins' hopes alive for an undefeated season.\nAfter punting on their opening drive, Miami got an early scoring opportunity when linebacker Doug Swift intercepted a pass from Browns quarterback Mike Phipps, giving the Dolphins a first down on the Browns 40-yard line. But Miami could only gain 1 yard over the next three plays and failed to score when Garo Yepremian missed a 46-yard field goal attempt. Their first score would come later, when Charlie Babb blocked a Cleveland punt, picked it up, and returned it for a touchdown. Following another Cleveland punt, Miami increased their lead to 10-0 by driving 51 yards, featuring a 21-yard run by receiver Paul Warfield on an end around play, and scoring on Yepremian's 40-yard field goal. Cleveland responded with a pair of runs for 32 total yards by Bo Scott and a 25-yard scramble by Phipps, giving the team a first down on the Dolphins 25-yard line. But once again they failed to score as the drive ended with an interception by Dolphins cornerback Curtis Johnson, who returned the ball 33 yards.\nUltimately, there would be no scoring in the second quarter, despite numerous chances for Miami. All the Dolphins got out of Johnson's interception return was a missed 53-yard field goal attempt by Yepremian. Later on, Browns punter Don Cockroft fumbled a high snap and was downed on the Cleveland 39 after he recovered the ball. But after a 15-yard holding penalty, a 9-yard loss on a sack by Browns lineman Walter Johnson, and a 12-yard loss on a run by Mercury Morris, the Dolphins found themselves pushed well out of scoring range. Dick Anderson later intercepted a pass from Phipps, but Yepremian's eventual field goal attempt was eliminated by a penalty on the last play of the first half.\nCleveland finally got on the board on their second drive of the third quarter, following a 38-yard punt return by Thom Darden that gave the team a first down on the Dolphins 44-yard line. Phipps completed a 21-yard pass to tight end Milt Morin on the first play, and eventually finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 10–7. Kiick racked up 26 yards on 4 carries on Miami's ensuing drive, but on his 5th carry, he lost a fumble that was recovered by Browns linebacker Charlie Hall. Following a Browns punt, Kiick picked up 12 yards on two carries, while Morris rushed twice for 24 yards to set up Yepremian's 46-yard field goal, increasing Miami's lead to 13–7.\nOn the Browns ensuing drive, Phipps picked up 14 yards on a scramble and then completed an 18-yard pass to receiver Fair Hooker on a drive to the Dolphins 38. Anderson initially shut down the drive with an interception, but he fumbled the ball during the return, and Hooker recovered it for Cleveland on the Miami 30-yard line. Two plays later, Phipps completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Hooker, giving the Browns their first lead of the game, 14–13, just under seven minutes into the fourth quarter.\nWith their undefeated season on the line, Miami responded by driving 80 yards in six plays for the game winning score. Quarterback Earl Morrall completed passes to Warfield for gains of 15 and 35 yards, while Morris added a 12-yard carry. A pass interference penalty on linebacker Bill Andrews gave the Dolphins a first down on Cleveland's 8-yard line, and Kiick scored the go-ahead touchdown run on the next play, giving Miami a 20–14 lead with 4:49 left in the game. Cleveland had two more chances to mount a comeback, but their first drive resulted in a punt, and on their final drive, Doug Swift recorded his second interception of the game, enabling Miami to run out the clock.\nMiami intercepted 5 of Phipps' passes and amassed 198 rushing yards. Neither team's quarterback had much success. Phipps completed just 9 of 23 passes for 131 yards and one touchdown, while Morrall completed only 6/13 passes for 88 yards. Scott was the Browns top performer with 94 rushing yards and 4 receptions for 30. “The best thing for us was to get behind,” said Miami fullback Larry Csonka after the game. “It got very quiet and somebody said ‘If we’re gonna get anything done, now’s the time to do it’. It got done.”\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Browns and Dolphins.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, December 31, 1972.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 21, Pittsburgh Steelers 17.\nThe Dolphins continued their unbeaten streak as substitute quarterback Bob Griese, who had not started a game since week 5, led the team to two touchdowns in the second half.\nThings started well for Pittsburgh as safety Glen Edwards intercepted a pass from Earl Morrall on the opening drive and returned it 28 yards to the Dolphins 48. Steelers running back Franco Harris subsequently gained 35 yards on 7 carries as the team drove to a third and 2 on the Miami 3-yard line. On the next play, Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw fumbled the ball as he tried to run into the end zone, but right offensive guard Gerry Mullins recovered it for a touchdown, giving the Steelers an early 7–0 lead. Unfortunately for the Steelers, Bradshaw was injured on the play and did not return until the fourth quarter. The Dolphins tied the game after punter Larry Seiple's 37-yard run on a fake punt set up Morrall's 9-yard touchdown pass to fullback Larry Csonka. The score would remain tied 7–7 at the end of the first half.\nOn the opening drive of the third quarter, Steelers quarterback Terry Hanratty completed passes to John McMakin and Ron Shanklin for gains of 22 and 24 yards, while John Fuqua added 24 yards on a draw play as the team drove to a 14-yard field goal by Roy Gerela, putting them up 10–7. At this point, Bob Griese, who had been sidelined with a broken leg for 10 weeks, replaced Morrall and threw a 52-yard completion to Paul Warfield on his first pass attempt. Miami also caught a break on the drive when an offsides penalty against Pittsburgh wiped out an interception by linebacker Jack Ham. Eventually, Jim Kiick finished the 11-play, 80-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, giving the Dolphins their first lead at 14–10. Near the end of the third quarter, Seiple's 33-yard punt gave Pittsburgh a first down on the Miami 48. Harris ran for 7 yards on the first play, but this was followed by two incompletions and Gerela's 48-yard field goal attempt was blocked.\nTaking over on the Steelers' 49 after the blocked field goal, the Dolphins drove 49 yards on an 11-play drive that only had one pass play. Kiick finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown run, giving Miami a 21-10 fourth quarter lead. However, Bradshaw returned to the game for the Steelers' next drive and quickly led them to a score. He started the drive with a 9-yard pass to tight end Larry Brown, and followed it up with consecutive 25-yard completions to Al Young and Shanklin. On the fourth play of the possession, he threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Young, cutting the score to 21–17. But on Pittsburgh's last two drives, he threw interceptions to Miami linebackers Nick Buoniconti and Mike Kolen, enabling the Dolphins to run out the rest of the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Steelers.\nNFC: Washington Redskins 26, Dallas Cowboys 3.\nCharley Taylor led the Redskins to the victory by recording 7 receptions for 146 yards and 2 touchdowns. Washington massively outgained Dallas in total yards (316–169), first downs (16–8), and third-down conversions (10/18–3/12), while holding them to a single field goal and shutting them out in the second half.\nHowever, the game seemed close before the final period. Washington took the opening kickoff and drove to the Cowboys 31-yard line, but Larry Brown lost a fumble there and safety Cliff Harris recovered the ball. However, Dallas fared no better, and ended up running just six plays in the entire quarter. Following a punt, Washington scored on a 13-play, 9-minute drive, with Brown rushing for 31 yards and catching a pass for 9. Curt Knight finished the drive with an 18-yard field goal in the second quarter. Later on, Redskins quarterback Billy Kilmer smoked the Cowboys with a 51-yard completion to Taylor, and eventually scored on a 15-yard touchdown pass to Taylor that gave his team a 10–0 lead. Near the end of the half, Dallas quarterback Roger Staubach's 29-yard run set up a Toni Fritsch field goal from 35 yards, cutting the score to 10–3. Fritsch later got another attempt on the last play before halftime, but missed a 23-yard attempt, his first miss of the season from under 30 yards.\nThe third quarter was scoreless, with Dallas unable to move the ball past their own 30-yard line, but they still had a few chances to score. At one point, Kilmer fumbled the ball at his own 32-yard line, and it rolled all the way back to the 18, but Washington recovered it. Mike Bragg's ensuing punt went 36 yards to the Dallas 44, but Charlie Waters lost five yards while attempting a return and a clipping penalty cost them another 15, pushing the Cowboys all the way back to the 24. To make matters worse, Waters (who was a starter on defense) suffered a broken arm on the play and had to miss the rest of the game.\nTaylor had already had an excellent game while being covered by Waters, and now that he was matched up against second stringer Mark Washington, Kilmer sensed a huge opportunity to break the game open. On their next drive, he completed four passes, the last a 45-yard touchdown bomb to Taylor on the second play of the fourth quarter, increasing Washington's lead to 17–3. The Redskins then dominated the rest of the game, scoring with field goals from Knight on each of their next three drives to make the final score 26–3.\nKnight had a dismal season, making just 14 of 30 field goal attempts, but he had proven to be unusually effective in the playoffs, making all three of his kicks against Green Bay in the divisional round. On this day, he came through with another big performance, finishing a perfect 4/4 by making his final three field goals from 39, 46, and 45 yards. Kilmer also had one of the best performances of his career, completing 14 of 18 passes for 194 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions, while also rushing for 15 yards. Brown was the top rusher of the game with 88 yards, and caught 2 passes for 16. Staubach completed just 9 of 20 passes for 98 yards, and was the Cowboys leading rusher with 5 carries for 59 yards.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Redskins.\nSuper Bowl VII: Miami Dolphins 14, Washington Redskins 7.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Dolphins and Redskins."

        "text": "The All-American Professional Basketball League was a minor basketball league formed in 2005 by Worth Christie. Announced on January 23, 2005 the league viewed itself as a direct minor league outlet for the National Basketball Association (NBA). The best players were to be promised salaries of up to $40,000. The league was composed of 10 teams and these ten teams were regionalized with 3-4 NBA teams where the designated AAPBL team could negotiate with players released from those NBA teams before other AAPBL teams could.\nThe AAPBL held a tryout camp at the MetraPark Arena in Billings, Montana from July 11 to July 23. Players paid $1,000 to participate in the training camp.\nThe league held two \"dispersal drafts\". On July 20, 2005 the league's teams drafted from available CBA and NBDL players. On July 28, 2005 the teams drafted from the players who participated in the training camp.\nOn August 1, 2005, mere days after the tryouts and drafts and days after insiders knew its fate, Worth Christie announced the league had folded. Contrary to earlier reports, few if any players who participated in the tryouts received their $1,000 back. Those working with the league and Christie were not paid for their expenses to work at the tryout camp nor were they compensated for any of the work done.\nOn July 29, 2006, the Billings Gazette reported that Worth Christie was facing over $100,000 in lawsuits from former AAPBL employees and coaches.\nAAPBL teams &amp; rosters.\nThe following lists the teams and their draft picks (from the two dispersal drafts). These players never signed contracts nor played with these teams, since the league folded so quickly.\nThe 1st pick of the draft went to the Mankato Mallards and they selected Sam Clancy who was the 2004-05 CBA Player of the Year.\nAAPBL team allocations.\nThe teams in the AAPBL were assigned NBA and college teams, largely based on region. Theoretically, if a player was released from a certain NBA team, the AAPBL team assigned with that NBA team was allowed the first chance to sign him before any other team in the AAPBL. For the college programs, it worked the same way. If a player wasn't drafted in the NBA draft he would have first rights to be picked up by the designated AAPBL team.\nAAPBL Summer League.\nThe Summer League Training Camp ran from July 11-July 23 at the MetraPark Arena in Billings, Montana. Each team in the league consisted of players who paid $1,000 to participate in the camp. Players drafted in the dispersal draft of July 20 were not included in this.\nStandings.\n+ Butte defeated Minot in play, therefore they technically rank ahead of Minot"

        "title": "1971–72 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 1971 season began on December 25, 1971. The postseason tournament concluded with the Dallas Cowboys defeating the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI, 24–3, on January 16, 1972, at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nLike the previous NFL seasons, the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly divisional rotation, excluding the wild card teams which would always play on the road. It was the first time that the NFL scheduled games on Christmas Day, a decision that drew considerable criticism.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the AFC playoff games, while CBS televised the NFC games and Super Bowl VI.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, December 25, 1971.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 20, Minnesota Vikings 12.\nAlthough the Vikings outgained the Cowboys in total yards 311–183, Dallas forced 5 turnovers and converted some of them into 13 points en route to a 20–12 win.\nEarly in the first quarter, Larry Cole forced a fumble from Dave Osborn that was recovered by fellow lineman Jethro Pugh on the Vikings 36-yard line. Dallas then drove to the Minnesota 19, mainly on the strength of an 18-yard completion from Roger Staubach to Bob Hayes, before defensive tackle Alan Page's 3rd down sack forced them to settle for Mike Clark's 26-yard field goal that gave them a 3–0 lead. The Vikings responded with a 27-yard field goal by Fred Cox that tied the score.\nIn the second quarter, the Vikings got a big chance to take the lead when quarterback Bob Lee completed a 49-yard pass to Bob Grim on the Dallas 29-yard line. But linebacker Chuck Howley ended the drive with an interception, returning the ball 26 yards to the Vikings 37, and the Cowboys drove to a 44-yard Clark field goal that put them up 6–3. Minnesota had another chance to score as Clint Jones returned the kickoff 61 yards, but all this would result in was 3 incomplete passes and a missed 41-yard field goal attempt by Cox.\nEarly in the second half, Cliff Harris intercepted a pass from Lee and returned it 30 yards to the Vikings 13-yard line, setting up Duane Thomas' 13-yard touchdown run to give Dallas a 13–3 lead. Minnesota had a big chance to get back in the game when Charlie West returned the ensuing kickoff 51 yards, but this merely resulted in another missed field goal try by Cox, this one a 46-yard attempt. Late the third quarter, Dallas safety Charlie Waters returned a punt 24 yards to the Cowboys 48, sparking their only sustained drive of the second half. Moving the ball 52 yards, including a 30-yard completion from Staubach to Lance Alworth on 3rd and 15, Dallas went up 20–3 on Staubach's 9-yard touchdown pass to Hayes.\nStill, Minnesota was not quite out of the game. Early in the 4th quarter, Paige sacked Staubach in the end zone for a safety. Then Vikings coach Bud Grant replaced Lee with Gary Cuozzo, who led the team to the Dallas 19 after the free kick. But Cowboys linebacker Lee Roy Jordan made a clutch interception that essentially put the game away. Cuozzo did manage to lead the team to a touchdown on a 6-yard pass to tight end Stu Voigt, making the score 20–12, but by then barely more than 2 minutes remained on the clock.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Vikings.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 27, Kansas City Chiefs 24 (2 OT).\nIn the longest NFL game played to date at 82 minutes, 40 seconds (in game time) (and the Chiefs' last game at Municipal Stadium), Miami kicker Garo Yepremian kicked the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of the second overtime period.\nThe Chiefs opened up the scoring with Jan Stenerud's 24-yard field goal. Willie Lanier intercepted a pass from Bob Griese and returned it 17 yards to set up Len Dawson's 7-yard touchdown pass to Ed Podolak, increasing the lead to 10–0. However, Griese rallied the Dolphins back on their next drive, completing a 23-yard pass to Paul Warfield and a 16-yarder to tight end Marv Fleming on the way to Larry Csonka's 1-yard touchdown run. Shortly before halftime, the Dolphins defense recovered a fumble from Podolak deep in Chiefs territory, enabling Garo Yepremian to kick a 14-yard field goal to tie the game, 10–10.\nKansas City retook the lead in the third quarter, on a 15-play, 75-yard drive that took 10 minutes off the clock and ended with Jim Otis' 1-yard score. Miami responded quickly though, storming right back to tie the game with a 1-yard touchdown run from Jim Kiick.\nIn the fourth quarter, Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti recovered a fumble to give his team a big scoring opportunity. But Kansas City took the ball right back when linebacker Jim Lynch intercepted Griese's pass on the Chiefs 9-yard line. Kansas City then stormed 91 yards, including a 63-yard completion from Dawson to rookie receiver Elmo Wright, to retake the lead, 24–17, with Podolak's 3-yard touchdown run. Miami struck right back as Griese completed passes to Warfield for gains of 17 and 26 yards before finishing the 71-yard drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Fleming, tying the game at 24 with 1:25 left in regulation. Podolak returned the ensuing kickoff 78 yards to the Dolphins 22-yard line before being shoved out of bounds by Miami's Curtis Johnson, giving Stenerud a chance to win the game for the Chiefs in the final minute of regulation. But he missed the field goal attempt from 32 yards wide right, and Miami regained the ball for their final possession in regulation. The Dolphins were unable to move the ball, and Larry Seiple punted back to the Chiefs. Podolak signaled for a fair catch, but Dennis Homan caught the punt as time expired in regulation. Chiefs Coach Hank Stram mistakenly thought his team had an opportunity for a free kick from 68 yards, which, if good, would have resulted in a game-winning field goal (according to the rules, there is no option for a free kick if the player signaling for a fair catch does not catch the ball). Fearing a return by Miami speedster Mercury Morris if Stenerud's kick fell short, Kansas City declined, and the game went to overtime.\nKansas City took the opening kickoff of the first overtime period, and Podolak returned it to the 46-yard line. Kansas City then drove into scoring range, but Stenerud's 42-yard field goal attempt was blocked. Yepremian also attempted a 52-yard field goal later in the period, but it was short. As the first overtime period came to an end, Dolphins safety Jake Scott intercepted a pass from Dawson on the Chiefs 46. But the team was unable to move the ball and had to punt. Following a Kansas City punt, Csonka's 29-yard run set up Yepremian's game-winning score.\nPodolak's 350 all-purpose yards (8 receptions for 110 yards, 17 carries for 85 yards, 3 kickoff returns for 154 yards, two punt returns for one yard) in this game remain an NFL playoff record, and is still the fourth highest total in NFL history. \"I don't think any one player in a big game, a monumental game like that, had a day like Eddie Podolak had,\" said Stram after the game. Chiefs running back Wendell Hayes added 100 rushing yards, while Wright caught 3 passes for 104 yards. Dolphins receiver Paul Warfield finished with 7 receptions for a career postseason high 140 yards, while Csonka rushed 24 times for 86 yards and linebacker Nick Buoniconti racked up 20 tackles. Kansas City would not reach the playoffs again until 1986 nor reach the Divisional Round until 1991.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Dolphins and Chiefs.\nSunday, December 26, 1971.\nAFC: Baltimore Colts 20, Cleveland Browns 3.\nDon Nottingham scored two touchdowns for the Colts, while their defense limited the Browns to only 165 yards, 11 first downs, and 3 points.\nHowever, the Browns had plenty of scoring chances early in the game. On their first series, quarterback Bill Nelsen completed a 39-yard pass to Fair Hooker, but Rex Kern forced and recovered a fumble from him on the Colts 12-yard line. Baltimore had to punt on their ensuing drive, and Leroy Kelly's 48-yard return gave the Browns a first down on the Colts 4. All the Browns got from this field position though, was a 16-yard field goal attempt from Don Cockroft that was blocked by defensive tackle Bubba Smith (who would also block another field goal later on.)\nAfter the blocked field goal, the Colts drove 93 yards in 17 plays, including a 7-yard run by Nottingham on 4th and inches, to score on Nottingham's 1-yard touchdown run. Later in the second quarter, Baltimore safety Rick Volk intercepted a pass from Nelsen and returned it 37 yards to the Browns 15-yard line, setting up Nottingham's second touchdown run on a 7-yard burst.\nAfter three consecutive drives in the third quarter ended in turnovers, Cleveland finally got on the board with a 14-yard field goal by Cockroft. But Baltimore stormed right back on 74-yard drive to go up 17–3 on a field goal by Jim O'Brien. O'Brien added a 14-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to finish off the scoring.\nNottingham was the sole offensive star for either team with 92 rushing yards, 5 receiving yards, and two scores.\nThis was third postseason meeting between the Colts and Browns. Both teams split their previous two meetings.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 24, Washington Redskins 20.\nThe 49ers defense made key plays to lead San Francisco to a 24–20 victory over the Redskins after trailing 10–3 at the end of the half.\nWashington scored first after Jon Jaqua blocked a punt from Steve Spurrier, enabling his team to take over on the 49ers 28. This set up quarterback Billy Kilmer's 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerry Smith. San Francisco responded with a 23-yard field goal from Bruce Gossett, but Speedy Duncan returned the ensuing kickoff 37 yards to set up a field goal for the Redskins, a 40-yard kick by Curt Knight. With the score at 10–3 and time running out in the half, Ted Vactor returned a punt 48 yards to the 49ers 11-yard line. But with 32 seconds left, receiver Roy Jefferson was dropped for a 13-yard loss by defensive end Cedrick Hardman on an end around play, and Knight's ensuing field goal attempt was blocked by linebacker Frank Nunley\nDuncan returned the second half kickoff 66 yards to the San Francisco 34, but the 49ers made a key defensive stand, stopping Washington on the 12 when Nunley tackled Larry Brown for a 2-yard loss on 4th and inches. Three plays later, facing 3rd down and 1, quarterback John Brodie threw a deep pass that went just over the outstretched arms of defensive back Pat Fischer and into the arms of receiver Gene Washington, who caught the ball in stride at the 40 and took off for a 78-yard touchdown reception. Then on the next series, Roosevelt Taylor's interception set up Bob Windsor's 2-yard touchdown reception to give San Francisco a 17–10 lead.\nDuncan returned the next kickoff 67 yards to set up a 35-yard Knight field goal, making the score 17–13. But with 3:20 left in the game, San Francisco put the game away when defensive tackle Bob Hoskins recovered a bad snap on a Washington punt attempt in the end zone for a touchdown. After this, the Redskins managed to cut the final score to 24–20 on Kilmer's 16-yard pass to Brown in the game's closing seconds.\nBrown rushed for 84 yards, while also catching 6 passes for 62 yards and a touchdown. Kilmer completed 11 of 26 passes for 106 yards and 2 touchdowns, with 1 interception. Duncan set a franchise playoff record with 170 yards on 3 kickoff returns. Brodie finished with 10/19 completions for 176 yards and two touchdowns.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Redskins and 49ers.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 2, 1972.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 14, San Francisco 49ers 3.\nThis was a rematch of the first NFC Championship Game played the previous season in San Francisco. Prior to , the NFL rotated hosting rights of playoff games between divisions, and the NFC East champion Cowboys had the right to host the 1971 title game. It was the fourth title game played by the Cowboys, and the 49ers' second title game appearance as an NFL team after the preceding season's game.\nDallas won the NFC East with an 11–3 record and defeated the NFC Central champion Minnesota Vikings 20–12 at Metropolitan Stadium in the Divisional Round to advance to the NFC Championship game. San Francisco won the NFC West with a 9–5 record and defeated the NFC East runner-up Washington Redskins 24–20 at Candlestick Park in the Divisional Round to reach the NFC title game. This was also the Cowboys' first season at the brand new Texas Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Irving. Since the Cowboys were on the road for the Divisional Round, the title game in San Francisco was the first NFL playoff game at Texas Stadium. Both teams played on artificial turf in their home stadiums. The 49ers moved to an expanded Candlestick Park in 1971, which had artificial turf from 1970 through 1978.\nAs was the case in 1970, the teams did not meet in the regular season, thus their most recent game was Dallas' win in the 1970 NFC title game, the final NFL game at Kezar Stadium. Their most recent regular season game, in 1969 on Thanksgiving at the Cotton Bowl, ended in a 24–24 tie.\nIn the first playoff game at Texas Stadium, the Cowboys' defense dominated the 49ers' offense, allowing only 61 rushing yards, nine first downs, and forcing three interceptions.\nScoreless into the second quarter, veteran Dallas defensive end George Andrie intercepted a screen pass from John Brodie and returned it seven yards to the 49ers' two to set up Calvin Hill's one-yard touchdown run. This was the only score of the game until the middle of the third quarter, when Brodie's 24-yard completion to tight end Ted Kwalick set up Bruce Gossett's 28-yard field goal.\nFollowing a missed 47-yard field goal by Gossett on San Francisco's next drive, Dallas QB Roger Staubach finished the quarter with a 17-yard completion to halfback Dan Reeves. Then he started off the fourth with a 23-yard pass to tight end Billy Truax. Duane Thomas completed the 14-play, 80-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run for a 14–3 lead, and the final score.\nWith nine minutes left in regulation, the Dallas defense took over the rest of the game, forcing turnovers on San Francisco's last three drives. First, linebacker Chuck Howley broke up a 4th down pass. Then on San Francisco's next possession, Brodie was intercepted by linebacker Lee Roy Jordan. Finally, after Mike Clark's 24-yard field goal attempt was blocked by 49ers linebacker Frank Nunley, safety Cliff Harris picked off a pass from Brodie that enabled Dallas to run out the clock.\nAfter the game, Dallas received a visit in the locker room from former President Lyndon Johnson, who told Staubach, \"You're the best. They should rename this place Staubach stadium.\"\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the 49ers and Cowboys, with Dallas winning both.\nThe NFC champion Cowboys made their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. Dallas defeated the Miami Dolphins of the American Football Conference 24–3 in Super Bowl VI at New Orleans to win their first Super Bowl.\nThe Cowboys made two more consecutive appearances in the NFC title game, but lost both, to the Washington Redskins and Minnesota Vikings. After a one-year absence from the title game (and playoffs), the Cowboys captured their second NFC championship in 1975.\nThe 49ers lost again to the Cowboys the following year in the playoffs, this time in the Divisional Round. San Francisco did not return to the postseason until 1981, when they finally beat Dallas in the NFC title game en route to their first Super Bowl appearance and victory.\nAFC: Miami Dolphins 21, Baltimore Colts 0.\nThe Dolphins reached the AFC title game in their sixth season, thus becoming the first of the then-four NFL teams which had commenced play after the start of the Super Bowl era to play in a title game. This made them the youngest franchise to make it to a Super Bowl era title game up to that point. Miami won the AFC East with a 10–3–1 regular season record and defeated the AFC Central champion Kansas City Chiefs in the longest NFL game in history, (27–24 in double overtime) at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium in the Divisional Round to advance to the AFC Championship game.\nThis was the second consecutive AFC Championship Game contested by the Colts, their third title game in the past four seasons, and their sixth title game appearance overall. While the defending AFC and Super Bowl champions failed to repeat as AFC East champions, their 10–4 regular season record was good enough for the then-one AFC wild card berth. Baltimore defeated the AFC Central champion Cleveland Browns 20–3 at Cleveland Stadium in the Divisional Round to reach the AFC title game.\nIn addition to being the first playoff meeting between these teams, the AFC title game was the Dolphins' first playoff game at home. Their only previous playoff game had been in the 1970–71 NFL playoffs when they were the AFC wild card. Just as significantly, it pitted Dolphins coach Don Shula against his former team, which he had left for Miami in acrimonious circumstances prior to the 1970 season.\nThis was the first post-merger conference championship game contested between division rivals, and also the first in either conference to not feature a West Division team. Miami and Baltimore split their two regular season games in the 1971 season, with the Dolphins winning 17–14 at the Orange Bowl while the Colts won 14–3 at Memorial Stadium.\nAlthough Miami quarterback Bob Griese completed only 4 passes, the Dolphins defense shut out the Colts. Defensive back Dick Anderson intercepted Johnny Unitas three times, returning one of them 62 yards for a touchdown.\nPaul Warfield recorded a 75-yard touchdown reception midway through the first quarter on the Dolphins second drive. Meanwhile, the Colts managed to move the ball close enough for Jim O'Brien to twice attempt field goals, but he missed both times. In the second quarter, the Colts drove from their own 18 to the Dolphins 9-yard line, featuring a 28-yard reception by Don Nottingham, but on 4th down and 1, Nottingham was stuffed by a gang of Dolphins defenders just inches short of the first down marker.\nIn the third quarter, Unitas threw a pass that was deflected by cornerback Curtis Johnson into the hands of Anderson, who took off for a 62-yard scoring return. Then in the fourth quarter, Griese's 50-yard pass to Warfield set up Larry Csonka's 5-yard touchdown run.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Colts and Dolphins.\nThe AFC champion Dolphins made their first Super Bowl appearance. Miami lost 24–3 to the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football Conference in Super Bowl VI.\nThis was the first of three consecutive AFC titles for the Dolphins, who would go on to win two consecutive Super Bowls with their first such championship being the only perfect NFL season in the modern era.\nThis was the last AFC Championship Game appearance by the Colts while they were based in Baltimore. The Colts relocated to Indianapolis in 1984, but did not return to the AFC Championship Game until the 1995 season which incidentally was the last season of the NFL's absence from Baltimore. A Baltimore-based team would finally return to the AFC Championship Game in 2000, which Baltimore's current team (the Ravens) won en route to their first Super Bowl championship.\nSix NFL teams have been enfranchised since 1971, four of which reached a title game (two in each conference) in less than the six seasons it took Miami to do so. Of those four clubs, the only team to win their first title game was the aforementioned Ravens in their fifth season. The Ravens, upon their enfranchisement, acquired the roster of the Cleveland Browns, who suspended operations for three seasons. The Ravens were not a 1996 expansion team from a football operations perspective.\nSuper Bowl VI: Dallas Cowboys 24, Miami Dolphins 3.\nThis is the only Super Bowl meeting between the Cowboys and Dolphins."

It was first awarded at the end of the league's inaugural season of 1979–80.\nThe head coaches of the league's 11 teams submit their votes following the end of the regular season and before the conference's tournament in early March. The coaches cannot vote for their own players. A select media panel's votes are also counted.\nThe award was introduced following the conference's first season in 1980, in which it was presented to John Duren of Georgetown. Patrick Ewing (Georgetown), Richard Hamilton (Connecticut), Troy Bell (Boston College), Troy Murphy (Notre Dame), Kris Dunn (Providence), and Collin Gillespie (Villanova) each won the award twice, while Chris Mullin (St. John's) won three consecutive times from 1983 through 1985. Four award winners have been inducted as players to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Ewing, who shared the award in 1984 and 1985 with Mullin, was inducted in 2008 after playing 17 years in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1985 and 2002. Mullin followed in 2011 after a 16-year NBA career (1985–2001). Georgetown's 1992 Player of the Year Alonzo Mourning entered the Hall in 2014 following a 16-year NBA career (1992–2008). The most recent award winner to enter the Hall is Ray Allen from Connecticut, who won the Big East award in 1996 and went on to a 19-season NBA career (1996–2014), getting inducted in 2018. There have been eight ties, the most recent instance was among Collin Gillespie and Jeremiah Robinson-Earl of Villanova along with Sandro Mamukelashvili of Seton Hall (2021).\nSeven players have been awarded a major national player of the year award in the same year that they received a Big East Player of the Year award. In 1985, Ewing and Mullin shared the conference award, while Ewing was named Naismith College Player of the Year and Mullin was given the John R. Wooden Award. The following year, Walter Berry of St. John's received the Wooden Award. In 1996, Allen received the conference award and was also the final recipient of the UPI Player of the Year Award. In 2004, Connecticut's Emeka Okafor won the conference award while sharing NABC Player of the Year honors with Jameer Nelson of Saint Joseph's. Creighton's Doug McDermott received all major national awards along with the conference award in 2014. Lastly, Villanova's Jalen Brunson was the consensus national player of the year in 2018.\nGeorgetown and Villanova are tied for the most winners with 8 selections each. The only current Big East members without a winner are Butler and Xavier, both of which joined the conference at its relaunch following its 2013 split into two leagues, and DePaul, members since 2005."

        "title": "Champ Car World Series",
        "text": "Champ Car World Series (CCWS) was the series sanctioned by Open-Wheel Racing Series Inc., a sanctioning body for American open-wheel car racing that operated from 2004 to 2008. It was the successor to Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), which sanctioned open-wheel racing from 1979 until dissolving after the 2003 season.\nVehicles.\nChamp Cars were single-seat, open-wheel racing cars, with mid-mounted engines. Champ cars had sculpted undersides to create ground effect and prominent wings to create downforce. The cars would use a different aerodynamic kit on the occasions they raced on an oval.\nWith funds low, development was effectively frozen with a focus on developing a universal chassis, and the series generally ran on CART-spec 2002 Lola chassis from 2003 to 2006. The new chassis was developed by Panoz and debuted in 2007 as the Panoz DP01. The chassis was well received by drivers and fans.\nThe series leased 750hp 2.65 L V-8 turbocharged Cosworth XFE engines to teams, which had been purchased by CART for the 2003 season.\nHistory.\nCART, following the departure of a number of top teams and engine manufacturers to the rival Indy Racing League (IRL), declared bankruptcy after the 2003 season. Gerald Forsythe, Kevin Kalkhoven, and Paul Gentilozzi founded Open-Wheel Racing Series LLC (OWRS) to bid on CART's assets and continue the series as its own entity. The IRL intended to bid a higher amount but had only committed to purchasing the series' Cosworth engines and the sanctioning contract for the Long Beach Grand Prix, effectively to make the series untenable and allow a takeover on their terms. OWRS was successful, as its bid allowed the highest probability CART vendors would get paid.\nOnce CART's assets were secured, the series began a major push to be able to field enough cars and drivers for the April Long Beach Grand Prix, with the final drivers announced just before practice began. The series featured three longtime CART teams, Forsythe Championship Racing, Newman/Haas Racing, and Dale Coyne Racing. OWRS also became owners of the Trans-Am Series and the Atlantic Championship. Champ Car was able to maintain a full field and most of CART's street circuit sanctioning agreements for 2004.\nChamp Car eventually moved into a 'de facto' all road-course format. The series would experiment with dramatic rule changes, including special compound tires that were to be used for a fixed portion of the race, standing starts, and timed races.\nBoth Champ Car and the IRL continued to suffer from reduced fields, sponsorship, and television ratings. Merger talks in 2006 were halted after disagreements regarding Champ Car's upcoming Panoz chassis and leaked details of a shared new series upset IMS. The 2007 season saw the withdrawal of Bridgestone and Ford as presenting sponsors and some race cancellations.\nBy January 2008, both the IRL and Champ Car feared they did not have enough participating cars to maintain their TV and sanctioning contract minimums. After successful merger negotiations, in mid-February 2008, Champ Car authorized bankruptcy to facilitate a February 22 agreement in principle to merge with the IRL. The IRL purchased the CCWS's sanctioning contracts, the Champ Car Mobile Medical Unit, the series history, and goodwill for $6 million, with Forsythe and Kalkhoven signing a non-compete agreement in exchange for $2 million each.\nWhile the first \"merged\" event of the rechristened \"IndyCar Series\" was the GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300 from Homestead-Miami Speedway on March 29, 2008, due to a scheduling conflict with the 2008 Indy Japan 300, the 2008 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach was held on April 20, 2008, as a Champ Car sanctioned event using CCWS-spec Panoz-Cosworth cars and the winners getting IRL points, with the event described as a final celebration of CART/CCWS.\nTelevision.\nSpike TV aired all races in 2004, with select races aired on high definition channel HDNet.\nIn 2005 and 2006, coverage was split among NBC, CBS, and Speed Channel. In 2007, coverage was split among NBC, CBS, ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPN Classic."

        "text": "Bob Casey (April 11, 1925 – March 27, 2005) was the only public address announcer in Minnesota Twins history until 2005. He started announcing Twins games when the franchise moved to Minnesota from Washington, D.C., in 1961.\nCasey worked 44 seasons and more than 3,000 games for the Twins. He was inducted into the Twins' Hall of Fame in 2003.\nEarly career.\nPrior to working for the Twins, Casey served as the announcer of the Minneapolis Millers, a Triple-A team in the old American Association, for 10 years. He also worked for the Minneapolis Lakers and the Minnesota Vikings during his career.\nTrademarks.\nCasey's voice was a trademark of the Minnesota ballpark experience. His style and signature player introductions made him a favorite of fans, players, umpires, the media and team staff. Casey, who missed only a handful of Twins games during his tenure with the team, was well known for his nasally voice and distinctive delivery. He would introduce star Kirby Puckett as \"Kirbee (prolonged \"e\") puck-it!\", remind fans there was \"No smoking\" (with a prolonged \"o\") at the Metrodome, than he'd add \"if you must smoke, go back to (whatever city the opposing team was from)\", and not to \"throw anything or anybody onto the field\".\nVerbal gaffes.\nCasey was also known for his occasional butchering of player names and calls on the field. Many viewed him as the master of mispronunciations. Dustan Mohr? Dustin Hoffman. Otis Nixon? Amos Otis. Nomar Garciaparra? Garcia Parra. Omar Vizquel? Ozzie Virgil. A great Casey moment was at a 1959 game between the Chicago Cardinals and Giants. Casey announced that\n\"The Giants have been penalized 15 yards for an illegitimate man on the field.\"\nIn the early 1970s, during a stadium bomb-scare, he announced that fans should \"leave the stadium quickly and calmly, as we have gotten a call that there is going to be an explosion in ten minutes.\"\nDeath.\nOn March 27, 2005, Casey died in Minneapolis aged 79, fifteen days before what would have been his 80th birthday. He had been battling liver cancer and pneumonia. Before he died, baseball great Alex Rodriguez took time to contact him. \"He's an icon in our game,\" Rodriguez said at the time. \"His voice will live on forever.\" Casey said Kirby Puckett and Alex Rodriguez were his favorite players, and had even asked Alex to help him take a ceremonial first pitch that June.\nFriends, family, and Twins legends Kent Hrbek, Tony Oliva, Dan Gladden, and Jack Morris served as pallbearers for the 44-year Twins announcer. They held those memories close Wednesday, March 30 as they said goodbye to Casey at his funeral at St. Olaf Catholic Church in Minneapolis. The April 8 home opener vs. the White Sox was an all-game tribute to Casey. There was an on field tribute before the game and members of the Casey family shared PA duties during the game."

        "title": "Swimming with Sharks",
        "text": "Swimming with Sharks (also known as The Boss and Buddy Factor) is a 1994 American satire film written and directed by George Huang and starring Kevin Spacey, Frank Whaley and Michelle Forbes.\nPlot.\nBuddy Ackerman, an influential movie mogul, hires Guy, a naïve young writer, as his assistant. Guy, who had just graduated from film school, believes that his new job is a golden opportunity. Despite warnings from Rex, the outgoing assistant who has become hardened under Buddy's reign, Guy remains optimistic.\nBuddy turns out to be the boss from hell; he treats Guy like a slave, subjects him to sadistic (and public) verbal abuse, and has him bending over backward to do meaningless errands that go beyond just his work life. Guy is humiliated and forced to bear the brunt of his insults. Guy's only solace is his new girlfriend Dawn, a producer at Buddy's firm. When Buddy apparently fires Guy in a phone call, Guy finally snaps and takes Buddy hostage in order to exact revenge. He ties Buddy up and subjects him to severe beatings, torture and mind games. It is later revealed that due to a botched call waiting function on Buddy's home phone, Guy hears Buddy and Dawn arranging a rendezvous at Buddy's house.\nOnce in Guy's power, Buddy reveals for the first time a human, vulnerable side. He tells Guy that his wife had been shot, raped and murdered on Christmas Eve 12 years prior, and reveals that he, too, was once a bullied assistant to powerful, tyrannical men and spent a decade putting up with such abuse to become successful himself. He also reveals that abusing Guy was his way of teaching Guy that he must earn his success. Dawn arrives at the scene to find Guy aiming a gun at Buddy's face and insists that she had only agreed to see Buddy as a way of helping Guy's career. Dawn pleads with Guy to put down the gun, whereupon Buddy tells Guy that he has to pull the trigger in order to get ahead in the business. After a moment's indecision, Buddy screams at Guy to shoot, which Guy does.\nThe climax of the film reveals that Guy killed Dawn (who is blamed for kidnapping and torturing Buddy), and was subsequently promoted. In the final scene, Guy coldly tells a former colleague to find out what he really wants and then do anything to get it, echoing the numerous times Buddy told Guy. The movie ends with a beaten up Buddy passing by Guy's office, making eye contact with him and silently gesturing to call him into his office for a meeting. Guy excuses himself and goes into Buddy's office, ignoring his ringing telephone. Buddy shuts his office doors as other employees walk by.\nProduction.\nGeorge Huang decided to write the script after having a conversation with Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez was in Los Angeles after his film \"El Mariachi\" brought him to the attention of Sony Pictures, where he befriended Huang. Huang told Rodriguez of his frustrations with filmmaking and was thinking of compiling stories from friends working for high-powered Hollywood executives, as well as stories based on his own experiences of being an assistant, into a book called \"Stories from Hollywood Hell.\" Rodriguez encouraged him to quit his post at Sony and pursue writing full-time so Huang could produce a script to direct himself.\nHuang's resultant script, \"Reel Life\", was picked up by Cineville executive Frank Evers, who brought in financing from independent investors, and significant production support from Sony Pictures Entertainment. The film was subsequently sold to Trimark Pictures (later assumed by Lionsgate in 2000). Cineville produced the film with Carl Colpaert, chairman of Cineville and Steve Alexander overseeing production.\nAlthough writer George Huang himself worked as an assistant for Barry Josephson, who was the Senior Vice President of Development at Sony Pictures at the time, some have suggested that Buddy's character was inspired by real life movie mogul Scott Rudin, while others suggest he is based on producer Joel Silver with Guy being based on Alan Schechter, Silver's assistant in the early 1990s.\nThe director Buddy hires in the film, Foster Kane, is named after Orson Welles' character in the 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\", Charles Foster Kane.\nReception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 76% based on reviews from 38 critics. The site's consensus states: \"\"Swimming With Sharks\" is a smart, merciless Hollywood satire that's darkly hilarious and observant, thanks to Kevin Spacey's performance as ruthless studio mogul Buddy Ackerman.\" On Metacritic it has a score of a 66% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nPraise was given to Spacey’s performance in particular. Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"The producer as megalomaniacal cutthroat — the devil with a cellular phone — is, by now, a standard figure of Hollywood satire. But Kevin Spacey takes this archetypal jerk to new levels of tyrannical bravado in the exuberantly nasty \"Swimming With Sharks\".\" Gleiberman said the character of Guy needed more fleshing out and ultimately gave the film a grade of B.\nMany noted the film’s nods to \"The Player\", a Hollywood satire that debuted two years prior. \"Variety\" wrote the film’s \"escalating face-off is climaxed by an unexpected arrival, and [its] surprise ending truly does \"The Player\" one better in its evaluation of how self-centered, amoral and insular Hollywood can be.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" commented, \"Mr. Whaley slyly captures the yes-man who happily eases into his boss's arrogant habits as the story goes on.\"\nRoger Ebert gave it three out of four stars. Though he found the ending to be implausible, he said \"The best parts of 'Swimming With Sharks' are in the details -- in how Guy develops telephone and lying skills, or how Buddy manipulates the phones. Eventually, Guy learns the biggest lesson of all from Buddy, and in the dark humor of that logic, the film finds its conclusion.\" Ebert concluded the film’s \"plot may be overwritten and the ending may be less than satisfying, but [Huang’s] eye and ear are right. In Hollywood, where power is the ultimate aphrodisiac, it is also the ultimate excuse for almost any conceivable behavior. Powerful executives, agents and stars behave the way they do - because they can. Huang finds great humor in that situation, and, unless I am mistaken, some quiet bitterness as well.\"\nThe film gained new significance in 2017 when the Harvey Weinstein abuse and sexual misconduct cases became public and the MeToo movement went viral, in addition to allegations of Spacey's own misconduct and Hollywood producer Scott Rudin's reported history of abuse of his staff. Writer and producer Angelina Burnett shared on Twitter: \"When I started out in this business \"Swimming with Sharks\" was required viewing. Veteran assistants recommended it as a way to emotionally prepare for what was coming. It was near guaranteed you were gonna get screamed at, and it was a badge of honor to be able to take it...\" Said Huang in a 2018 interview, \"It does sort of frighten me that people see the film as a primer. It isn’t proscriptive. I was merely holding a mirror up to the way it works. It was supposed to be a cautionary tale, not a how-to — but I still had agents and managers and producers calling me and saying, 'Hey, can I get a copy of the film? We want to show it to our trainees.' They were using it for instruction.\"\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nHome media.\n\"Swimming with Sharks\" was first released on DVD by Lionsgate on August 12, 1998. For the film's tenth anniversary, Lionsgate released a Special Edition DVD on June 7, 2005. The DVD includes audio commentary from Huang, Whaley, and Spacey, as well as featurettes including \"Back to the Tank: 10 Years Later\", a retrospective piece about the making of the film. It received a Blu-ray release on July 19, 2021, from UK company Fabulous Films.\nStage adaptation.\nA stage adaptation penned by Michael Lesslie had its world premiere at London's Vaudeville Theatre in October 2007. The play starred Christian Slater as Buddy, Matt Smith as Guy, Arthur Darvill as Rex and Helen Baxendale as Dawn. Academy Award nominee Demián Bichir opened a Spanish version of the play in Mexico City in January 2012.\nA Singapore theatre company, PANGDEMONiUM!, opened the play in Singapore at Drama Centre from 20 September to 7 October 2012. The play starred Adrian Pang as Buddy, George Young as Guy and Janice Koh as Dawn.\nTelevision adaptation.\nIn 2022, an adaptation written by Kathleen Robertson streamed on The Roku Channel after premiering at South by Southwest. The adaptation stars Diane Kruger and Kiernan Shipka."

        "title": "Single (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a single is scored when the batsman take one run, either following a successful shot (with the run attributed to the on-strike batsman) or when running for a bye or leg bye (counted as an extra).\nUnlike when a boundary is hit (and the run are scored even if the batsmen don't leave their creases), scoring a single requires the batsmen to physically run between the wickets. This introduces the risk of being run out, so effective communication between the batsmen is vital. If one batsman attempts to run and the other stays put, then a humiliating run out is likely, but quick and well attuned batsmen may be able to run \"quick singles\" when other batsmen would not. In general, singles are much easier to score when the field is set further out, but bringing more fielders in makes it easier for the on-strike batsman to hit boundaries.\nSingles usually rotate the strike in a partnership, but because the bowling end changes at the end of an over, singles deliberately only taken at the end of an over are used by quality batsmen to keep the strike when they are batting with the tail-enders, who are unlikely to survive for long against quality bowling and whom an experienced batsman will normally try to protect."

        "title": "Partnership (cricket)",
        "text": "A partnership is a term used in cricket, that usually refers to the two batters and the runs they score together, including extras. Two batters bat in a partnership, although only one is a striker at any time. The collaboration between two batsmen will end when one is dismissed or retires, or the innings comes to a close, usually due to victory, a declaration, a time or over limit being reached, or the match being abandoned. In exceptional cases, if one of the original batters is injured, a player may run between the wickets on behalf of the injured batter. However, any runs scored by the injured batter will be recorded as being in partnership with the two original batters. A partnership may refer to two bowlers bowling from each end of the wicket.\nStrategy in cricket.\nStrong batting cohesion in partnerships is widely considered to be an important aspect of cricket. Generally speaking, top-order batters are superior to low-order batters; therefore, partnerships are usually greater when between two top-order batters, although it is relatively common for a lower-order batter with good defense to intelligently coordinate strike rotation to preserve wickets in hand and keep runs ticking over, a strategy that is common in both one-day cricket and Test cricket. A key to a successful partnership is when batters have differing playing styles. For instance, Marcus Trescothick, known for an aggressive batting style, and Mike Atherton, known for a defensive approach, formed successful opening partnerships for England. Likewise, batters' differing physical appearances may also contribute to a successful partnership. An example of this is Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett. Crawley is a tall right-hander batter, whereas Duckett is a much shorter left-handed batter. It is encouraged that they rotate the strike, allowing each other to face the bowler regularly, and effective communication in calling runs is considered preferable for a successful partnership.\nLower-order partnerships are usually much smaller than those for early alliances. Middle- and low-order batters often score at a higher strike rate in specific scenarios. The batter is to score as many runs as possible before running out of batting partners, a tactic usually employed when a Test team is considering a declaration or when a one-day innings is closing in on its conclusion. Batters such as Adam Gilchrist and Andrew Flintoff are considered some of the best middle-order batters. Similarly, in a citation where no recognized batters remain, tail-end batters may often play aggressively for more runs before the team is all out. Another example, as alluded to earlier, is where there is one not-out recognized batter and one tail-end batter; in this case, the recognized may often seek to be on strike as much as possible. A specific example of this was in Test cricket when Ben Stokes and Jack Leach scored a crucial partnership of 75 to win a match at Headingley during the 2019 Ashes Series.\nIn red-ball cricket.\nDuring opening partnerships, the primary focus is often on seeing off the new ball in test and first-class cricket. Later partnerships, emphasize consolidation, facing an aging ball, spin bowling, and eventually, the second new ball.\nBatting in partnership becomes even more crucial when only one recognized quality batsman remains. In such cases, their responsibility includes guiding the lower-order batters while attempting to score as many runs as possible or simply trying to save the game. Minimizing risk is vital, often achieved by exposing the lesser batters to as little bowling as possible. Boundaries and twos are preferred, and singles are avoided, especially in the early parts of an over. However, scoring a single or three runs on the last ball of the over may be necessary to counteract the change of bowling ends.\nIn white-ball cricket.\nIn t20 and ODI cricket, batters will often look to score at a higher strike rate. The higher strike rate is more apparent in the powerplay.\nWest Indies Team held the record for the highest partnership against Zimbabwe at Canberra on 24 Feb 2015. Marlon Samuels and Chris Gayle scored 372 for the 2nd wicket.\nEffect on the opposition.\nLarge partnerships do more than add runs to the scoreboard; they may also serve to exhaust and demoralize the fielding team. Both of these were significant factors at the famous Test match at Eden Gardens in 2001, when India's V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid put on a fifth-wicket stand of 376 runs, staying at the crease for the entire fourth day's play without being dismissed. Despite forcing their opponents to follow on, Steve Waugh's highly regarded Australians were left emotionally and physically drained, slumping to a shock-heavy (171 runs) defeat. Even if nowhere near as damaging numerically, larger-than-expected last-wicket stands can still be very demoralizing, mainly because as soon as the Number 11 batter walks out of the pavilion, many of the fielders expect to be batting within minutes and start their mental preparations. Suppose the last wicket partnership lasts much longer than they expect. In that case, it hurts their preparation and composure, and their energy level deteriorates from extra time on the field. It also damages the bowlers' confidence if they cannot easily dismiss a team's worst batter. \nAn excellent example was the First Test between Australia and New Zealand at Brisbane Cricket Ground in 2004. The Kiwis performed well for the first two days. While the Australians did recover strongly on the third, the New Zealanders were still well in the hunt when Glenn McGrath, the Australian fast bowler, and notoriously poor batsman, came to the crease to accompany fellow tail-ender Jason Gillespie with nine wickets down. Incredibly, the pair put on 114 runs, both achieving half-centuries (McGrath's first in a long Test career in which he has never averaged more than 8 with the bat). The humiliated New Zealanders needed more energy and focus. When they finally removed McGrath and went into the bat, their batting order was devastated, collapsing to 76 all out, giving Australia an innings victory with a day to spare. During the second Test of the 2005 Ashes, Australia's tail-enders Shane Warne, Michael Kasprowicz, and Brett Lee famously held out during their second innings after England's bowlers had decimated the top order and nearly won a tightly contested match, losing by a mere two runs, the narrowest margin in Ashes history.\nBowling partnerships.\nTwo bowlers are bowling in tandem when they bowl all of a particular set of consecutive overs.\nJames Anderson and Stuart Broad hold the record for most wickets in a bowling partnership. They have taken 1039 wickets together.\nTest record partnerships by wicket.\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021\nTop 10 Test partnerships (for any wicket).\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021\nFirst-class record partnerships by wicket.\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021\nTop 10 first-class partnerships (for any wicket).\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021\nOne-Day International record partnerships by wicket.\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021\nTop 10 One-Day International partnerships (for any wicket).\nCorrect as of 1 November 2021"

        "text": "Tic-tac (also tick-tack and non-hyphenated variants) is a traditional method of signs used by bookmakers to communicate the odds of certain horses. Until the turn of the 21st century it was a very common sight on racecourses in the UK, but with the advent of mobile technology it is now seldom seen. In 1999, only three practitioners were noted to be still working on the southern UK tracks – Micky 'Hokey' Stuart, Billie Brown and Rocky Roberts. A tic-tac man will usually wear bright white gloves to make his hand movements easily seen.\nIn a newspaper interview in March 1937 Charles Adamson, a retired bookmaker of Ashford, Middlesex, said he and his brother Jack (John Thomas Adamson) had invented the tic-tac system and first began to use it in 1888.\nA few simple examples of signals:\nWithin the UK there are some regional variations in the signals, for example in the south odds of 6/4 are represented by the hand touching the opposite ear, giving the slang term \"ear'ole\", whereas the same odds are indicated in the north by the hand touching the opposite elbow (\"half arm\").\nSome of the signals may be called out verbally too. These names have evolved over time in a mixture of Cockney rhyming slang and backslang. For example, 4–1 is known as \"rouf\" (four backwards).\nEssentially, bookmakers use tic-tac as a way of communicating between their staff and ensuring their odds are not vastly different from their competitors, an advantage the punters could otherwise exploit. In particular, if a very large bet is placed with one bookmaker, this may be signalled to the others as a way of lowering the price on all the boards.\nBritish racing pundit John McCririck used tic-tac as part of his pieces to camera when explaining the odds of the horses for the next race.\nWhile this method of communication is used less frequently than before, many of the terms persist."

        "text": "Ronald Lavern Hansen (born April 5, 1938) is an American former shortstop in Major League Baseball who played for the Baltimore Orioles (1958–1962), Chicago White Sox (1963–1967, 1968–1969), Washington Senators (1968), New York Yankees (1970–1971) and Kansas City Royals (1972). He batted and threw right-handed. In a 15-season career, Hansen was a .234 hitter with 106 home runs and 501 RBI in 1384 games.\nHansen's career was hampered throughout and was eventually cut short by chronic back ailments and other injuries. Despite being a tall shortstop at , , Hansen was fluid and smooth in the field. He was a competent hitter as well.\nHansen was born in Oxford, Nebraska, on April 5, 1938, and moved with his family to Albany, California, when he was age 2. He was a three-sport star in baseball, basketball and football at Albany High School where he graduated in 1955. He signed with the Orioles on April 7, 1956, after declining a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley.\nA case of sciatica forced him to miss the entire 1957 season, costing him his first chance to make the Orioles. His major-league debut came in a 6–1 win over the Washington Senators in the 1958 season opener at Memorial Stadium on April 15. His first hit in the majors was a single to center field off Pedro Ramos in the sixth inning of another season-opening victory over the Senators in the same ballpark two years later on April 19, 1960. Between the two milestones, he appeared in only 14 games in the majors and established an Orioles record among position players by going hitless in his first 25 at-bats to begin his career with the ballclub.\nHansen surpassed all expectations by turning in a solid, injury-free 1960 season, filling the Orioles urgent need for a quality shortstop. He appeared in 153 games, and finished with 22 home runs, 86 RBI, 22 doubles, five triples, a .255 batting average and a .342 on-base percentage, batting from the eight spot. He was selected for the All-Star Game and earned American League Rookie of the Year honors, getting 22 of 24 votes, as well as the \"TSN\" Rookie of the Year Award.\nHansen led AL shortstops in double plays in 1961, hitting 12 home runs with 51 RBI in 155 games. In the fall of 1961, Hansen was recalled for military service. Before the 1963 season, he was sent to the White Sox along with knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm in the same trade that brought Luis Aparicio to the Orioles.\nWith Chicago, Hansen led the AL twice more in double plays and four times in assists. During a doubleheader in 1965, he tied an AL record with 18 total chances in the first game and added 10 more in the second for a total of 28, to set a major league record for a doubleheader.\nIn 1964, Hansen posted career-highs in batting average (.261), runs (85), hits (160) and doubles (25), and belted 20 home runs with 68 RBI. In 1965 he led the league with 162 games played, but was out again with back problems in 1966, appearing in only 23 games. He underwent surgery for a ruptured spinal disc and returned in 1967, playing in 157 games.\nIn February 1968, Hansen was sent to the Senators as part of a six-player trade, with infielder Tim Cullen being one of the players received by the White Sox. On July 30, while playing for the Senators in a game against the Cleveland Indians, Hansen turned the eighth unassisted triple play in major league history and the first in 41 years. In the bottom of the first inning, Hansen caught a line drive off the bat of Joe Azcue, touched second base to put out Dave Nelson, then tagged Russ Snyder coming from first base. In the at-bats following the triple play, Hansen struck out six consecutive times – four times on July 30, and twice more on July 31. On August 1 he hit a grand slam home run, and the following day, batting .185, was traded back to the White Sox. Curiously, Hansen was exchanged for Cullen, the first time in MLB history where two players were traded for each other twice in the same season.\nAgain with the White Sox, Hansen served in a backup role for the rest of the 1968 season, and again in 1969. He then finished his career as a utility infielder with the New York Yankees and the Kansas City Royals. After retiring as a player, he stayed involved with baseball, serving at different times as a major league coach and minor league manager, and also as an advance scout for the Yankees and then the Philadelphia Phillies, until retiring in 2010. During his work with the Phillies, Hansen was in the stands at Progressive Field in Cleveland on May 12, 2008, when Indians second baseman Asdrúbal Cabrera made his unassisted triple play, against the Toronto Blue Jays."

        "text": "In basketball, a flop is an intentional fall or stagger by a player after little or no physical contact by an opposing player in order to draw a personal foul call by an official against the opponent. The move is sometimes called \"acting\", as in \"acting as if he was fouled\". Because it is inherently designed to deceive the official, flopping is generally considered to be unsportsmanlike. Nonetheless, it is widely practiced and even perfected by many professional players. The player that commits the act is referred to as a \"flopper\". \nFlopping effectively is not easy to do, primarily because drawing contact can sometimes result in the opposite effect—a foul called on the defensive player—when too much contact is drawn or if the player has not positioned himself perfectly. Additionally, even if no foul is called on either player, by falling to the floor, the flopping defensive player will have taken himself out of position to provide any further defensive opposition on the play, thus potentially allowing the offense to score easily. To consistently draw offensive fouls on opponents takes good body control and a great deal of practice.\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) added a rule in 1997 to cut down on flopping in the key 'paint' near the basket, adding a 4-foot (1.22 meter) restricted arc (noted with a dashed circle) around the center of the basket to help prevent flops. Such flops are charged as blocking fouls or no-calls, or goaltending if done above the rim. In the 2012–13 season, the league began fining guilty players.\nIn the NBA, the penalty for \"flopping\" is a technical foul if caught in-game, and a fine if caught after the game in video reviews. The technical foul is a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul (one of six fouls a player may be assessed before disqualification; no ejection is possible). In FIBA play, the penalty is a technical foul that counts as one of two towards ejection.\nNational Federation of State High School Associations basketball rule 10.6.f of 2012–13 specifically defines \"faking being fouled\", in the judgment of an official, as unsportsmanlike conduct subject to penalty of a technical foul, but in practice without any in-game access to replay video, this call is exceptionally rare.\nNBA.\nThe NBA regulated flopping starting in the 2012–13 season. Any player who flops during the regular season would first be warned, followed by fines in increments of $5,000 for each successive flop during the season. The fines would increase to $30,000 for a fifth offense, when a suspension would also be considered. In the playoffs, players are fined $5,000 for their first flopping offense, $10,000 for a second, $15,000 for a third, and $30,000 for a fourth. Any player who flops five or more times could be suspended.\nHistory.\nFrank Ramsey, who played on seven championship teams for the Boston Celtics from 1954 to 1965, wrote a cover story in \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1963 with writer Frank Deford, where he detailed his flopping technique. Afterwards, Ramsey was reprimanded in a letter by NBA president Walter Kennedy. In the 1970s, Ramsey's coach, Red Auerbach, criticized flopping in one of his \"Red on Roundball\" segments at halftime during NBA game telecasts.\nOn May 28, 2008, the NBA announced that it would impose fines on players who show a clear case of flopping and suspensions for repeat offenders. However, the league did not impose any fines, but continued to monitor the situation.\nNBA player Rasheed Wallace has been critical of flopping in the league. In a 2008 interview, when he was with the Detroit Pistons, he complained that:\nOn November 28, 2009, Wallace, by this time with the Boston Celtics, again made sports news wires when he claimed that Hedo Türkoğlu, then with the Toronto Raptors, duped the officials into giving Wallace his fifth technical of the season by flopping:\nCommissioner David Stern complained about flopping as offensive against the game's officials, but the league has been unable to find a way to punish it or prevent it. And, although Stern agreed with Wallace in principle, the league fined Wallace $25,000. for the 2008 outburst (because of the obscenities) and $30,000 for the second.\nShaquille O'Neal loathes opponents who resort to flopping. He criticized Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year, in the 2001 NBA Finals and Vlade Divac in the 2002 Western Conference finals for their theatrics. O'Neal said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\" In a 2006 interview in \"Time\", O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy--not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\" However, in a matchup against the Orlando Magic on March 3, 2009, O'Neal flopped against center Dwight Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\" O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"\nShortly before the Indiana Pacers were to take on the Miami Heat in the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals, Pacers head coach Frank Vogel criticized his opponents for alleged flopping:\n Vogel was fined $15,000 by the league for these remarks.\nIn May 2012, Commissioner David Stern reiterated that flopping is a legitimate concern. Fines for flopping were introduced the following season. On November 21, 2012, Brooklyn Nets forward Reggie Evans became the first NBA player to be fined for flopping. After having been warned for a previous offense, the NBA league office identified an instance of flopping on Evans in the Nets' loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on November 20, 2012. Evans was fined $5,000. The rate of violations slowed as the season progressed, an indication that players realized the rule was being enforced. There were 24 violations during that regular season, with five players receiving the $5,000 fine for a second offense.\nIn the 2013 Eastern Conference semifinals between the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat, Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau accused LeBron James of flopping. James vehemently denied the accusation, saying \"I don't need to flop. I play an aggressive game but I don't flop. I've never been one of those guys. I don't need to flop. I don't even know how to do it. So it doesn't mean much to me.\" Thibodeau was fined $35,000 by the league for his comments. Nonetheless, James was seen winking after a flop in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals in 2011. On May 29, 2013 before Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Indiana Pacers, James again denied that he is a flopper, but said that he recognizes flopping as an effective strategy. \"Some guys have been [flopping] for years, just trying to get an advantage. Any way you can get an advantage over the opponent to help your team win, so be it,\" James said.\nAs of June 14, 2013, eight players had been fined for flopping during the playoffs: Pacers' Jeff Pendergraph, Thunder's Derek Fisher, Knicks' J. R. Smith, Grizzlies' Tony Allen, Heat's LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Pacers' David West and Lance Stephenson. Stern said that the amounts of the fines were insufficient \"when the average player's salary is $5.5 million. And anyone who thought that was going to happen was allowing hope to prevail over reason.\"\nOn June 7, 2013, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban announced that he is funding a study on flopping. One of Cuban's companies, Radical Hoops Ltd., has provided $100,000 to have biomechanics experts from Southern Methodist University launch an 18-month study into the forces involved in collisions during basketball plays. The goal is to investigate the possibility of using video or motion capture techniques to distinguish between legitimate collision and flop. The Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki did not believe that flops were a problem if a player was pushed and tried \"sell it a little\" to get a favorable call from referees."
