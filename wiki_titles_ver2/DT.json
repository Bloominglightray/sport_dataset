Fourteen teams competed from August, 1990 until May, 1991 for the Stones Bitter Championship, Premiership Trophy and Silk Cut Challenge Cup.\nSeason summary.\nSummary.\nBradford Northern player Simon Tuffs tested positive for amphetamines, and was the first time a failed drugs test involving a rugby league player had been made public since random testing had been introduced by the RFL in 1987. He received a two-year suspension, but the ban was lifted following an appeal.\nDue to a fixture backlog, Wigan, who were challenging for the league championship title, were forced to play their final eight league games within 19 days, a task described as \"Mission Impossible\" by coach John Monie. The club managed to win seven out of eight games to retain the title.\nIn April 1991, clubs approved a new three division format to be used from the start of the 1991–92 season. The Championship would remain a 14 team league, while the Second Division would consist of eight teams and the new Third Division would have 14 teams.\nLeague tables.\nWigan retained their title this season, relegated were Oldham, Sheffield Eagles and Rochdale Hornets, to date this is Rochdale Hornets's last appearance in the top flight.\nKangaroo Tour.\nThe months of October and November also saw the appearance of the Australian team in England on their 1990 Kangaroo Tour. Other than the three test Ashes series against Great Britain (won 2–1 by Australia), The Kangaroos played and won matches against 8 Championship teams (St Helens, Wakefield Trinity, Wigan, Leeds, Warrington, Castleford, Hull and Widnes), 1 Second Division side (Halifax) and one county side (Cumbria). The team was coached by 1973 tourist and 1978 tour captain Bob Fulton and was captained by Mal Meninga who was making his third Kangaroo Tour as a player.\nPenrith Panthers halfback Greg Alexander (who played most of the tour as the backup fullback to Gary Belcher), was the leading point scorer on the tour with 156 from 14 tries and 50 goals. Like Terry Lamb on the 1986 tour, Alexander was selected for every match on the tour, but he did not get off the bench in the 2nd Ashes Test at Old Trafford. Cronulla-Sutherland outside back Andrew Ettingshausen was the leading try scorer with 15 including hat-tricks against St Helens in the tour opener and Wigan a week later.\nGreat Britain's win in the first test at Wembley was the Lions first test win on home soil over Australia since 5 November 1978. It was the Kangaroos only loss of the tour."

        "title": "Fencing response",
        "text": "The fencing response is an unnatural position of the arms following a concussion. Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as combat sports, American football, Ice hockey, rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules football. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.\nRelationship to fencing reflex and posturing.\nThe fencing response is similar to the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex in infants. Like the reflex, a positive fencing response resembles the \"en garde\" position that initiates a fencing bout, with the extension of one arm and the flexion of the other.\nTonic posturing preceding convulsion has been observed in sports injuries at the moment of impact where extension and flexion of opposite arms occur despite body position or gravity. The fencing response emerges from the separation of tonic posturing from convulsion and refines the tonic posturing phase as an immediate forearm motor response to indicate injury force magnitude and location.\nPathophysiology.\nThe neuromotor manifestation of the fencing response resembles reflexes initiated by vestibular stimuli. Vestibular stimuli activate primitive reflexes in human infants, such as the asymmetric tonic neck reflex, Moro reflex, and parachute reflex, which are likely mediated by vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. The lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN; Deiter’s nucleus) has descending efferent fibers in the vestibulocochlear nerve distributed to the motor nuclei of the anterior column and exerts an excitatory influence on ipsilateral limb extensor motor neurons while suppressing flexor motor neurons. The anatomical location of the LVN, adjacent to the cerebellar peduncles (see cerebellum), suggests that mechanical forces to the head may stretch the cerebellar peduncles and activate the LVN. LVN activity would manifest as limb extensor activation and flexor inhibition, defined as a fencing response, while flexion of the contralateral limb is likely mediated by crossed inhibition necessary for pattern generation.\nIn simpler terms, the shock of the trauma manually activates the nerves that control the muscle groups responsible for raising the arm. These muscle groups are activated by stimuli in infants for instincts such as grabbing for their mothers or breaking their falls. The LVN has neurons that connect it to motor neurons inside grey matter in the spinal cord, and sends signals to one side of the body that activate motor neurons that cause extension, while suppressing motor neurons that cause flexing. The LVN is located near the connection between the brain and the brain stem, which suggests that excessive force to the head may stretch this connection and thus activate the LVN. The neurons that are stimulated suppress neighboring neurons, which prevents neurons on the other side of the body from being stimulated.\nInjury severity and sports applications.\nIn a survey of documented head injuries followed by unconsciousness, most of which involved sporting activities, two thirds of head impacts demonstrated a fencing response, indicating a high incidence of fencing in head injuries leading to unconsciousness, and those pertaining to athletic behavior. Likewise, animal models of diffuse brain injury have illustrated a fencing response upon injury at moderate but not mild levels of severity as well as a correlation between fencing, blood–brain barrier disruption, and nuclear shrinkage within the LVN, all of which indicate diagnostic utility of the response.\nThe most challenging aspect to managing sport-related concussion (mild traumatic brain injury, TBI) is recognizing the injury. Consensus conferences have worked toward objective criteria to identify mild TBI in the context of severe TBI. However, few tools are available for distinguishing mild TBI from moderate TBI. As a result, greater emphasis has regularly been placed on the management of concussions in athletes than on the immediate identification and treatment of such an injury.\nOn-field predictors of injury severity can define return-to-play guidelines and urgency of care, but past criteria have either lacked sufficient incidence for effective utility, did not directly address the severity of the injury, or have become cumbersome and fraught with inter-rater reliability issues."

Switzerland won the tournament with a narrow 2–1 victory over Japan in the final.\nFor the third consecutive year the number of participants grew, with this year's third tier having ten nations in two groups. The two groups played independent of each other in Bucharest, Romania and Maribor, Slovenia. Initially the two group winners, Slovakia and the Netherlands, were promoted to Division I with Denmark and Norway being relegated to Division I Qualification. However, before the 2003 season was played the formation of the divisions were changed.\nThe women's tiers were reformatted for 2003, so there would be a top level of eight teams, and Divisions I, II, III each with 6 teams. The winner of the 2001 Division I tournament was promoted to the 2003 World Championship, replacing the nation relegated from there. The relegated team and the next five placed nations formed Division I for 2003. The bottom two teams from 2001 Division I along with the top four nations from the two qualifying tournaments formed the 2003 Division II. All remaining participants proceeded to the 2003 Division III.\nWorld Championship Division I.\nThe eight participating teams were divided up into two seeded groups as below. The teams played each other once in a single round robin format. The top two teams from the group proceeded to the Final Round, while the remaining teams played in the consolation round. In the placing rounds, the first place teams played each other for the promotion, while the fourth place teams were relegated.\n2003 Division I Qualification.\nAt the time these tournaments were played it was understood that the winner of each group would be promoted to Division I for 2003.

        "text": "The Louisville Colonels were a Minor League Baseball team that played in Louisville, Kentucky, from 1901 to 1962 and 1968 to 1972. The name, like that of the 19th century Major League team of that name, is derived from the historic Kentucky colonels.\nHistory.\nIn the 20th century, several Minor League Baseball teams in Louisville, Kentucky, have been known as the Louisville Colonels. In 1909, the Colonels won the American Association pennant, as they also did in 1921, 1925, 1926, and 1930 while featuring players such as Joe McCarthy, Billy Herman, and Earle Combs; Combs hit .344 in 1923 and .380 in 1924 before joining the New York Yankees in 1925. Pee Wee Reese was a rookie with the 1938 Colonels. The Colonels were one of few minor league teams to play throughout World War II, and they won pennants in 1944 and 1945. In 1944, the Colonels played in the Junior World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, and the game drew an attendance of 52,833 — 16,265 more than any single World Series game that year. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the Colonels were part of the Boston Red Sox farm system, and they won the pennant in 1954. The Red Sox transferred its affiliation to the San Francisco Seals after the 1955 season.\nStarting in 1956, the Colonels were affiliated with the Washington Senators. They moved to Fairgrounds Stadium in 1957. In 1959, the Colonels became affiliated with the Milwaukee Braves. They won (in 1960, with pitcher Phil Niekro) one of three appearances in the Junior World Series in that time, but in 1962 the American Association folded.\nIn October 1967, Walter J. Dilbeck purchased the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League and moved them to Louisville, renaming them the Colonels. They played in the International League through the 1972 season. During this stretch, players included Carlton Fisk, Dwight Evans, Luis Tiant, and Cecil Cooper. The franchise had to move when the Kentucky State Fair Board announced that Fairgrounds Stadium would be renovated for football in a manner that would make it unsuitable for baseball. The team relocated to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and became known as the Pawtucket Red Sox. Baseball returned to Louisville when the same stadium was renovated for baseball in 1981 and the Springfield Redbirds came to Louisville as the Louisville Redbirds, later called the Louisville Bats, setting minor league attendance records and outdrawing several major league teams.\nAffiliations.\nThe Colonels were affiliated with the following Major League Baseball teams:"

        "title": "List of India Test cricket records",
        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match is scheduled to take place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing full member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nThis is a list of Indian Cricket team's Test Cricket records. It is based on the List of Test cricket records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the Indian cricket team. India was granted Test status in 1932 to be the sixth nation to play Test cricket.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for India only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nTeam wins, losses, draws and ties.\n, India played 579 Test matches resulting in 178 victories and defeats each, 222 draws and 1 tie for an overall winning percentage of 30.74.\nTeam scoring records.\nMost runs in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored in Test cricket came in the series between Sri Lanka and India in August 1997. Playing in the first Test at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, the hosts posted a first innings total of 6/952d. This broke the longstanding record of 7/903d which England set against Australia in the final Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval. The fifth and last Test of the 2016–17 series against the England saw India set their highest innings total of 759/7d.\nHighest successful run chases.\nIndia's highest fourth-innings total is 445 all out in an unsuccessful run chase against Australia at Adelaide in January 1978. Australia had set a target of 493. India's second-highest fourth-innings total of 429/8 came against England at The Oval in 1979. Having been set a target of 438 runs, India required 9 runs to win with 2 wickets in hand when the fifth day's play ended resulting in a draw. India's highest successful run chase occurred against the West Indies at Port of Spain in 1976 and is also their third-highest fourth-innings total. West Indies had set India a target of 403.\nFewest runs in an innings.\nThe lowest score in Test history for India is 36 scored in their second innings against Australia in the first Test of the 2020 Australian tour.\nMost runs conceded in an innings.\nThe highest innings total scored against India is by Sri Lanka when they scored 952/6d in the first Test of the Indian's tour of Sri Lanka in 1997 at R. Premadasa Stadium.\nFewest runs conceded in an innings.\nThe lowest innings total scored against India is 55 in the second test of India's tour of South Africa in 2023-24\nResult records.\nA Test match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by innings).\nThe fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series at The Oval saw England win by an innings and 579 runs, the largest victory by an innings in Test cricket history. The largest victory for India, which is the 12th largest, is their win against West Indies in the first Test of the 2018–19 tour at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, where the hosts won by an innings and 272 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by runs).\nThe largest victory recorded by India, the 8th largest overall, is the third Test of England's 2024 tour of India by 434 runs.\nGreatest win margins (by 10 wickets).\nIndia have won a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on 8 occasions.\nNarrowest win margins (by runs).\nIndia's narrowest win by runs was against Australia in the fourth Test of the 2004 Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Wankhede Stadium. Set 107 runs for victory in the final innings, Australia were bowled all out for 93 to give victory to India by thirteen runs. This was the equal sixteen-narrowest win in Test cricket, with the narrowest being the West Indies' one-run win over Australia in 1993.\nNarrowest win margins (by wickets).\nIndia's narrowest win by wickets came in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in October 2010. Played at the PCA Stadium, the hosts won the match by a margin of one wicket, one of only fourteen one-wicket victories in Test cricket.\nGreatest loss margins (by innings).\nThe Oval in London played host the greatest defeat by an innings in Test cricket. The final Test of the 1938 Ashes saw England defeat the tourists by an innings and 579 runs, to the draw the series at one match all. India's biggest defeat came at home during the West Indies tour in 1958 when they lost by an innings and 336 runs at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.\nGreatest loss margins (by runs).\nThe first Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series saw Australia defeated by England by 675 runs, the greatest losing margin by runs in Test cricket. India's biggest defeat by runs was against Australia in the third Test of the 2004 Border-Gavaskar Trophy at VCA Stadium after which not only did India loose the match, they lost the series as well, making it Australia's first series win on Indian soil since their 1969-70 tour. \nGreatest loss margins (by 10 wickets).\nIndia have lost a Test match by a margin of 10 wickets on 18 occasions with most recent being during the 2nd test of the India's tour of New Zealand in 2020.\nNarrowest loss margins (by runs).\nThe narrowest loss of India in terms of runs is by 12 runs against Pakistan in the first test of the Pakistan's tour of India in 1999.\nNarrowest loss margins (by wickets).\nThe narrowest loss of India in terms of wickets is by 2 wickets against Australia in the second test of India's tour of Australia in 1978-79.\nTied matches.\nA tie can occur when the scores of both teams are equal at the conclusion of play, provided that the side batting last has completed their innings. Only two matches have ended in a tie in Test cricket history, both of which involved Australia.\nBatting records.\nMost career runs.\nA run is the basic means of scoring in cricket. A run is scored when the batsman hits the ball with his bat and with his partner runs the length of of the pitch. Alternatively, a player can score multiple runs by hitting the aforementioned ball out of the boundary rope for 4 or 6 runs.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar has scored the most runs in Test cricket with 15,921. Second is Ricky Ponting of Australia with 13,378 ahead of Jacques Kallis from South Africa in third with 13,289. Rahul Dravid and Sunil Gavaskar are the only other Indian batsmen who have scored more than 10,000 runs in Test cricket.\nHighest individual score.\nThe first test of the South Africa's tour of India in 2008 saw Virender Sehwag score his second triple century and record India's highest Individual score.\nHighest career average.\nA batsman's batting average is the total number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been dismissed.\nMost half-centuries.\nA half-century is a score of between 50 and 99 runs. Statistically, once a batsman's score reaches 100, it is no longer considered a half-century but a century.\nSachin Tendulkar of India has scored the most half-centuries in Test cricket with 68. He is followed by the West Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 66, India's Rahul Dravid and Allan Border of Australia on 63 and in fifth with 62 fifties to his name, Australia's Ricky Ponting.\nMost centuries.\nA century is a score of 100 or more runs in a single innings.\nTendulkar has also scored the most centuries in Test cricket with 51. South Africa's Jacques Kallis is next on 45 and Ricky Ponting with 41 hundreds is in third.\nMost double centuries.\nA double century is a score of 200 or more runs in a single innings.\nFor the most double centuries, Don Bradman holds the Test record scored with twelve, one ahead of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara who finished his career with eleven. In third is Brian Lara of the West Indies with nine. India's Virat Kohli is one of three cricketers who reached the mark on seven occasions.\nMost triple centuries.\nA triple century is a score of 300 or more runs in a single innings.\nSehwag holds the equal Test record for the most triple centuries scored with two, along with Australia's Don Bradman and West Indians Chris Gayle and Brian Lara. Karun Nair is the only other Indian who has scored a single Test triple century .\nMost runs in a series.\nThe 1930 Ashes series in England saw Don Bradman set the record for the most runs scored in a single series, falling just 26 short of 1,000 runs. He is followed by Wally Hammond with 905 runs scored in the 1928–29 Ashes series. Sunil Gavaskar with 774 in the 1971 tour of West Indies is the highest Indian on the list.\nMost ducks.\nA duck refers to a batsman being dismissed without scoring a run. Ishant Sharma has scored the joint fifth-highest number of ducks in Test cricket.\nBowling records.\nMost career wickets.\nA bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket. If the batsman is dismissed by run out, obstructing the field, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or timed out the bowler does not receive credit.\nShane Warne held the record for the most Test wickets with 708 until December 2007 when Sri Lankan bowler Muttiah Muralitharan passed Warne's milestone. Muralitharan, who continued to play until 2010, finished with 800 wickets to his name. James Anderson of England is third on the list taking 700 wickets holds the record for most wickets by a fast bowler in Test cricket.\nIndia's Anil Kumble is fourth on the list and the highest ranked Indian bowler taking 619 wickets.\nBest figures in an innings.\nBowling figures refers to the number of the wickets a bowler has taken and the number of runs conceded.\nThere have been three occasions in Test cricket where a bowler has taken all ten wickets in a single innings – Jim Laker of England took 10/53 against Australia in 1956, India's Anil Kumble in 1999 returned figures of 10/74 against Pakistan, New Zealand's Ajaz Patel in 2021 obtained figures of 10/119 against India. Subhash Gupte, Jasu Patel and Kapil Dev are three Indian bowlers of 15 bowlers who have taken nine wickets in a Test match innings.\nBest figures in a match.\nA bowler's bowling figures in a match is the sum of the wickets taken and the runs conceded over both innings.\nNo bowler in the history of Test cricket has taken all 20 wickets in a match. The closest to do so was English spin bowler Jim Laker. During the fourth Test of the 1956 Ashes series, Laker took 9/37 in the first innings and 10/53 in the second to finish with match figures of 19/90. \nNarendra Hirwani's figures of 16/136, taken in his debut test, during the fourth match of the West Indies tour of India in 1987, is the third-best in Test cricket history.\nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nNineteenth century English medium pacer George Lohmann holds the record for the best career average in Test cricket with 10.75. J. J. Ferris, one of fifteen cricketers to have played Test cricket for more than one team, is second behind Lohmann with an overall career average of 12.70 runs per wicket.\nBest career economy rate.\nA bowler's economy rate is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of overs they have bowled.\nEnglish bowler William Attewell, who played 10 matches for England between 1884 and 1892, holds the Test record for the best career economy rate with 1.31. India's Bapu Nadkarni, with a rate of 1.67 runs per over conceded over his 41-match Test career, is fourth on the list.\nBest career strike rate.\nA bowler's strike rate is the total number of balls they have bowled divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nAs with the career average above, the top bowler with the best Test career strike rate is George Lohmann with strike rate of 34.1 balls per wicket. India's Jasprit Bumrah is the highest-ranked Indian bowler on this list.\nMost five-wicket hauls in an innings.\nA five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five wickets in a single innings. Ravichandran Ashwin is fourth on the list of most five-wicket hauls behind Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan, Australia's Shane Warne and New Zealand's Richard Hadlee in Test cricket.\nMost ten-wicket hauls in a match.\nA ten-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking ten or more wickets in a match over two innings.\nAs with the five-wicket hauls above, Anil Kumble is not only behind Muralitharan, Warne and Hadlee, he is also behind Rangana Herath of Sri Lanka in taking the most ten-wicket hauls in Test cricket.\nWorst figures in an innings.\nThe worst figures in a single innings in Test cricket came in the third Test between the West Indies at home to Pakistan in 1958.

He returned figures of 0/180 from his 23 overs in the first innings and 0/80 off 14 in the third innings for a total of 0/260 from 37 overs. He claimed the record in his final over when two runs came from it – enough for him to pass the previous record of 0/259, set 54 years prior.\nThe worst figures by an Indian is by E. A. S. Prasanna in the first test of the India's tour of England in 1967.\nMost wickets in a series.\nEngland's seventh Test tour of South Africa in 1913–14 saw the record set for the most wickets taken by a bowler in a Test series. English paceman Sydney Barnes played in four of the five matches and achieved a total of 49 wickets to his name. India's B. S. Chandrasekhar is joint 18th with his 35 wickets taken against England during the 1972–73 tour.\nHat-trick.\nIn cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nIn Test cricket history there have been just 44 hat-tricks, the first achieved by Fred Spofforth for Australia against England in 1879. In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa. The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble, against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan's Wasim Akram, in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nIndia's MS Dhoni is fifth in taking most dismissals in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper.\nMost career catches.\nDhoni is seventh in taking most catches in Test cricket as a designated wicket-keeper.\nMost career stumpings.\nBert Oldfield, Australia's fifth-most capped wicket-keeper, holds the record for the most stumpings in Test cricket with 52. Indian glovemen Syed Kirmani and MS Dhoni are both equal third on 38.\nMost dismissals in an innings.\nFour wicket-keepers have taken seven dismissals in a single innings in a Test match—Wasim Bari of Pakistan in 1979, Englishman Bob Taylor in 1980, New Zealand's Ian Smith in 1991 and most recently West Indian gloveman Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 2000.\nThe feat of taking 6 dismissals in an innings has been achieved by 24 wicket-keepers on 32 occasions including 4 Indians.\nMost dismissals in a match.\nThree wicket-keepers have made 11 dismissals in a Test match, Englishman Jack Russell in 1995, South African AB de Villiers in 2013 and most recently India's Rishabh Pant against Australia in 2018.\nThe feat of making 10 dismissals in a match has been achieved by 4 wicket-keepers on 4 occasions with Wriddhiman Saha being the only Indian.\nMost dismissals in a series.\nBrad Haddin holds the Test cricket record for the most dismissals taken by a wicket-keeper in a series. He took 29 catches during the 2013 Ashes series. Indian record is held by Rishabh Pant when he made 20 dismissals during the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia in 2018.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nIndia's Rahul Dravid holds the record for the most catches in Test cricket by a non-wicket-keeper with 209, followed by Mahela Jayawardene of Sri Lanka on 205 and South African Jacques Kallis with 200. Ricky Ponting is the highest ranked Australian in fourth, securing 196 catches in his Test career.\nMost catches in a series.\nThe 1920–21 Ashes series, in which Australia whitewashed England 5–0 for the first time, saw the record set for the most catches taken by a non-wicket-keeper in a Test series. Australian all-rounder Jack Gregory took 15 catches in the series as well as 23 wickets. Greg Chappell, a fellow Australian all-rounder, and India's KL Rahul are equal second behind Gregory with 14 catches taken during the 1974–75 Ashes series and during the 2018 Indian tour of England respectively. Four players have taken 13 catches in a series on six occasions with both Bob Simpson and Brian Lara having done so twice and Rahul Dravid and Alastair Cook once.\nAll-round Records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 71 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their Test career.\n250 runs and 20 wickets in a series.\nA total of 18 players on 24 occasions have achieved the double of 250 runs and 20 wickets in a series.\nOther records.\nMost career matches.\nIndia's Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the most Test matches played with 200, with former captains Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh being joint second with each having represented Australia on 168 occasions.\nMost consecutive career matches.\nFormer English captain Alastair Cook holds the record for the most consecutive Test matches played with 159. He broke Allan Border's long standing record of 153 matches in June 2018. Sunil Gavaskar, the Indian opener played 106 consecutive Test matches, is fourth. The recently retired New Zealand wicket-keeper-batsman Brendon McCullum, who is fifth on the list with 101 matches, is the highest ranked cricketer who never missed a Test match during his playing career. Rahul Dravid, in ninth on 93, is the highest ranked Indian player to achieve the feat.\nMost matches as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most matches played as captain in Test cricket with 109. Virat Kohli who led the side for seven years from 2014 to 2022 is sixth on the list with 68 matches.\nMost wins as captain.\nGraeme Smith, who led the South African cricket team from 2003 to 2014, holds the record for the most wins as captain in Test cricket with 53.\nYoungest players on Debut.\nThe youngest player to play in a Test match is claimed to be Hasan Raza at the age of 14 years and 227 days. Making his debut for Pakistan against Zimbabwe on 24 October 1996, there is some doubt as to the validity of Raza's age at the time. The youngest Indian to play Test cricket was Sachin Tendulkar who at the age of 16 years and 205 days debuted in the first Test of the series against Pakistan in November 1989.\nOldest players on Debut.\nEngland left-arm slow bowler James Southerton is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the very first inaugural test against Australia in 1876 at Melbourne Cricket Ground, in Melbourne, Australia, he was aged 49 years and 119 days. Rustomji Jamshedji is the oldest Indian Test debutant when he played his only game during the first Test of the 1933–34 series at the Bombay Gymkhana.\nOldest players.\nEngland all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes is the oldest player to appear in a Test match. Playing in the fourth Test against the West Indies in 1930 at Sabina Park, in Kingston, Jamaica, he was aged 52 years and 165 days on the final day's play. The oldest Indian Test player is Vinoo Mankad who was aged 41years and 300 days when he represented India for the final time in the fifth Test of the 1959 tour by West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, then known as Feroze Shah Kotla Stadium.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest Test partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the Sri Lankan pairing of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene who put together a third wicket partnership of 624 runs during the first Test against South Africa in July 2006. This broke the record of 576 runs set by their compatriots Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanama against India in 1997. India's Vinoo Mankad and Pankaj Roy hold the 12th highest Test partnership with 413 made in 1956 against New Zealand.\nUmpiring records.\nMost matches umpired.\nAn umpire in cricket is a person who officiates the match according to the \"Laws of Cricket\". Two umpires adjudicate the match on the field, whilst a third umpire has access to video replays, and a fourth umpire looks after the match balls and other duties. The records below are only for on-field umpires.\nAleem Dar of Pakistan holds the record for the most Test matches umpired with 130. The current active Dar set the record in December 2019 overtaking Steve Bucknor from the West Indies mark of 128 matches. They are followed by South Africa's Rudi Koertzen who officiated in 108. The most experienced Indian is Srinivas Venkataraghavan who is tenth on the list with 73 Test matches umpired."

        "text": "The 2011–12 UEFA Champions League was the 57th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 20th season in its current Champions League format. As part of a trial that started in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League, two extra officials – one behind each goal – were used in all matches of the competition from the play-off round.\nThe final was held at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. Chelsea's caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo led the club to win their first Champions League title after beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties in the final. As tenants of the Allianz Arena (known as Fußball Arena München for the final), this meant that Bayern were the first finalists to have home advantage since 1984. By winning the tournament, Chelsea earned a berth at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup and 2012 UEFA Super Cup. Barcelona were the defending champions, but were eliminated by the eventual winners Chelsea in the semi-finals.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 76 teams participated in the 2011–12 Champions League from 52 UEFA associations (Liechtenstein organises no domestic league competition). Associations are allocated places according to their 2010 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2005–06 to 2009–10.\nBelow is the qualification scheme for the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League:\nDistribution.\nSince the winners of the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League, Barcelona, obtained a place in the group stage through their domestic league placing, the reserved title holder spot in the group stage was effectively vacated. To compensate:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses.\nRound and draw dates.\nAll draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless stated otherwise.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2011 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties. Teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe draw for the first and second qualifying rounds was held on 20 June 2011. The first legs were played on 28 June, and the second legs were played on 5 and 6 July 2011.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe first legs were played on 12 and 13 July, and the second legs were played on 19 and 20 July 2011.\nHJK's 10–0 win over Bangor City in the second leg broke the record for the largest margin of victory in the current Champions League format.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe draw for the third qualifying round was held on 15 July 2011. The first legs were played on 26 and 27 July, and the second legs were played on 2 and 3 August 2011.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (called the Champions Route) and one for non-champions (called the League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the play-off round of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.\nPlay-off round.\nThe draw for the play-off round was held on 5 August 2011. The first legs were played on 16 and 17 August, and the second legs were played on 23 and 24 August 2011.\nThe play-off round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (called the Champions Route) and one for non-champions (called the League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the group stage of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage features 32 teams, which were allocated into pots based on their 2011 UEFA club coefficients (except the title holders, Barcelona, who were placed in Pot 1 automatically), and then drawn into eight groups of four. Teams from the same association cannot be drawn against each other. The draw was held on 25 August 2011 in Monaco.\nIn each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays are 13–14 September, 27–28 September, 18–19 October, 1–2 November, 22–23 November, and 6–7 December 2011. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the round of 32 of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League.\nIf two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):\nThe 32 teams comprise 11 former winners of the European Cup/Champions League (40 titles combined), and five teams (Manchester City, Napoli, Trabzonspor, Viktoria Plzeň and Oțelul Galați) making their debut appearance in the group stage. Eighteen UEFA member associations are represented in this group stage: England and Spain by four clubs, Italy, Germany and France by three, Russia and Portugal by two, while eleven associations are represented by one club, which are all domestic champions except Trabzonspor, which replaced Fenerbahçe due to match-fixing allegations.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The draw for the round of 16 was held on 16 December 2011. The draws for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final (to determine the \"home\" team) were held on 16 March 2012. Both draws were assisted by German footballer Paul Breitner, the ambassador for the 2012 final.\nIn the draw for the round of 16, the eight group winners were seeded, and the eight group runners-up were unseeded. The seeded teams were drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded team hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association could not be drawn against each other. In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association may be drawn with each other.\nRound of 16.\nThe first legs were played on 14, 15, 21 and 22 February, and the second legs were played on 6, 7, 13 and 14 March 2012.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 27 and 28 March, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 April 2012.\nSemi-finals.\nThe first legs were played on 17 and 18 April, and the second legs were played on 24 and 25 April 2012.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on 19 May 2012 at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round."

The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29 and August 2 at the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona. There were 93 competitors from 25 nations, with nations in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo of the Unified Team, the first victory by a Soviet or former Soviet in the event since 1980. The silver went to Hrihoriy Misyutin, a Ukrainian also competing for the Unified Team. Yoo Ok-ryul gave South Korea its second consecutive bronze medal in the men's vault.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the eight finalists from 1988 returned: silver medalist Sylvio Kroll of East Germany (now unified Germany), fourth-place finisher Deyan Kolev of Bulgaria, and seventh-place finisher Yukio Iketani of Japan. Yoo Ok-Ryul of South Korea had won the last two world championships (1991 and 1992), with Vitaly Scherbo and Ihor Korobchynskyi the runners-up.\nPuerto Rico and Slovenia each made their debut in the men's vault; some former Soviet Republics competed as the Unified Team. The United States made its 16th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 vault and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. In a change from previous years, the preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 93rd based on preliminary score.\nResults.\nNinety-three gymnasts competed in the vault event during the compulsory and optional rounds on July 27 and 29. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 2. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. No scores carried over from the preliminary to the final."

The qualification and final rounds took place on July 27, 29 and August 2 at the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona. There were 93 competitors from 25 nations, with nations in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Vitaly Scherbo of the Unified Team, the fourth time in five Games that a Soviet or former Soviet gymnast won the rings. Li Jing of China earned silver. There was a tie for third, with Andreas Wecker of Germany and Li Xiaoshuang of China each receiving bronze medals. It was the first medal for unified Germany since 1936, though East Germany had won gold and bronze in 1988.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Two of the eight finalists from 1988 returned: bronze medalist Sven Tippelt of East Germany and fourth-place finisher Kalofer Khristozov of Bulgaria. The reigning (1991) world champion was Grigory Misutin of the Unified Team. Wecker had placed second in both 1989 and 1991.\nPuerto Rico and Slovenia each made their debut in the men's rings; some former Soviet Republics competed as the Unified Team. The United States made its 16th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 rings and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. In a change from previous years, the preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 93rd based on preliminary score."

Keeping in line with previous major championships success, the four-man Kenyan team entered for the event contained a number of race favourites.\nThe Kenyans were led by the reigning World and Olympic champion Brimin Kipruto, followed by 2004 Olympic champion and world-leader Ezekiel Kemboi, and finally Olympic medallists Paul Kipsiele Koech and Richard Mateelong. Two French athletes offered the strongest possibility of beating the Kenyans, with Olympic silver medallist Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad and European record holder Bouabdellah Tahri. Other possible medallists were the in-form Moroccan Jamel Chatbi and the European Champion Jukka Keskisalo.\nAfter Mekhissi-Benabbad pulled up due to injury in the heats, the chance of a Kenyan podium sweep increased. All three heats were won by a Kenyan athlete, and Kenyan-born Tareq Mubarak Taher, who now competes for Bahrain, was the fastest non-Kenyan qualifier. Chatbi, who had finished second in his heat, became the first athlete of the championships to test positive for banned substances. His \"A\" sample showed traces of clenbuterol and he was withdrawn from the final.\nIn the final, South African Ruben Ramolefi lead early on, but he was soon overtaken by Koech and Kemboi. Around the halfway mark, a group of five athletes were leading the field: the four Kenyan runners and Frenchman Tahri. Defending champion Kipruto was the only one to fall away from the leading pack and Koech, Kemboi, Mateelong were the first to reach the home stretch. In a close finish, Kemboi won in 8:00.43, and Mateelong took the silver. Tahri made a strong run to the line to upset the Kenyan's podium sweep hopes, beating Koech to the bronze and setting a new European record in the process. The top four runners had all beaten Moses Kiptanui's fourteen-year-old Championship record in what was the fastest ever steeplechase race at the World Championships.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat(Q) and the next 3 fastest(q) advance to the final.\nKey: DNF = Did not finish, NR = National record, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: AR = Area record, CR = Championship record, DNS = Did not start, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best"

Eighty-six gymnasts competed in the vault event during the compulsory and optional rounds (of the team event) on September 19 and 21. In the compulsory round each gymnast had one vault, while in the optionals, each had two, with only the best one to count. The gymnasts best optional vault was added to her compulsory vault to give the total preliminary (prelim) score (maximum 20.00). The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 25. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Each gymnast carried over half of her preliminary points to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score. In the final each gymnast had two vaults which had to be different, with the gymnasts score being the average of the two. This final score was then added to her prelim score to give the final result."

        "text": "The women's 400 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on 15, 16 and 18 August. The world-leader prior to the competition, Sanya Richards, was regarded as the favourite in the event, although her previous failure to convert circuit dominance to major championship success raised some doubts. Reigning Olympic and world champion Christine Ohuruogu entered the championships as only the 25th fastest in the world that year, although a low-key run up also preceded her previous victories. Jamaicans Shericka Williams and Novlene Williams-Mills were predicted as possible medallists, while Russian Antonina Krivoshapka held the second fastest time in the world prior to the tournament.\nAll the favoured athletes made it through the heats and Motswana Amantle Montsho, a 2008 Olympic finalist, had the fastest time of the day with 50.65 seconds. Unusually, two of the race favourites, Richards and Ohuruogu, faced each other in the first round, with the Richards taking first place. The two faced each other again in the semi-finals, and Richards again beat the defending champion. The other two semi-finals were much faster, however, with five athletes breaking 50 seconds. Shericka Williams and Debbie Dunn set personal bests to qualify in the second final, and Montsho and Williams-Mills had run season's best to qualify – Aliann Pompey's national record was not enough to reach the final.\nIn the final, Richards started the race quickly, leading the first 100 m. Krivoshapka pulled slightly ahead of her at the halfway, but Richards regained the lead on the final bend. She remained in front through the home straight and won in a world-leading 49 seconds flat. Williams overtook Krivoshapka on the final stretch to take silver with a personal best of 49.32 seconds, and the Russian retained third place for the bronze. Williams-Mills was close behind for fourth place, but it was Ohuruogu's fifth-place finish that drew more attention.\nRichards, often the fastest 400 m runner on the athletics circuit, won her first major gold medal of her career with the 38th sub-50 clocking of her career – the most of any athlete. After a lacklustre season, the 2007 World Champion Ohuruogu could not repeat the performance that had made her Olympic champion the previous year. Shericka Williams had twice lowered her personal best, and her silver medal-winning performance was 0.02 seconds outside of Lorraine Fenton's Jamaican record. Krivoshapka's bronze was Russia's first medal in the event in the post-Soviet era.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 6 fastest(q) advance to the semifinals.\nKey: PB = Personal best, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each semifinal(Q) and the next 2 fastest(q) advance to the final.\nKey: DNF = Did not finish, NR = National record, PB = Personal best, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)"

A collier by trade, Evans typified the style of forward player favoured by the Welsh selectors during the early 1900s.\nRugby career.\nEvans spent his entire rugby career with unfashionable Monmouthsire club Blaina, turning down several approaches by professional rugby league clubs to 'go North'. He had an immense loyalty to his home club and spent his entire life in the village where he was born. In 1904 Evans received his one and only international call-up, becoming the first player to be directly capped from Blaina RFC. Evans was brought into the Wales team to face England in the opening game of the 1904 Home Nations Championship, captained by Cardiff's Gwyn Nicholls. Evans was only one of two news caps in the Welsh squad for the encounter, the other being David John Thomas from Swansea; both men coming into the pack. The game ended in a draw, after a late try from Teddy Morgan was disallowed to prevent a Welsh victory. The Welsh selectors responded by bringing in five new caps for the next match, and Evans was one of those replaced.\nAfter leaving his playing career behind, Evans became a committee man for Blaina. His family also had strong connections to the club, with his brother Alf captaining the team for two seasons, and his son Bill playing for Blaina before switching to first class team Newport. Evans died in 1947, just 100 yards from his birthplace. At his funeral, international rugby players Jack and Billy Gore were among his bearers.\nInternational matches played for Wales.\nWales"

        "title": "Super Six World Boxing Classic",
        "text": "The Super Six World Boxing Classic was a professional boxing tournament organized by the Showtime television network in co-operation with Sauerland Event. The tournament was held from 2009 to 2011, with all fights being contested in the super middleweight division. The winner of the tournament, Andre Ward, unified the WBA (Super title), WBC and \"The Ring\" Super Middleweight titles.\nThe competitors entered into the tournament were then-WBA Super Middleweight Champion Mikkel Kessler, then-undefeated WBC Super Middleweight Champion Carl Froch, 2004 Olympic gold medalist Andre Ward, former middleweight champions Jermain Taylor and Arthur Abraham, and 2004 Olympic bronze medalist Andre Dirrell. Taylor and Kessler withdrew during the tournament and were replaced by former light heavyweight champion Glen Johnson and super middleweight contender Allan Green.\nThe first matches took place on October 17, 2009. After three group stages, two semi-final matches were set. Ward defeated Abraham in the first, held on May 14, 2011. Froch defeated Johnson in the second, held on June 4, 2011. After Froch defeated Johnson, he was elevated to the number 2 rating by Ring Magazine. With Ward being rated number 1, the final pitted the number 1 and number 2 fighters against one another. This allowed for the Ring title vacancy to be filled at the tournament final.\nWBA Champion Ward beat WBC Champion Froch in the final of the tournament on 17 December 2011 at Boardwalk Hall, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States.\nFormat.\nAll bouts were scheduled for 12 rounds.\nThe original format was based on a slate of six fighters who would compete throughout the group stage of the tournament, folding down to semi-final and final matches. The original format was adjusted due to numerous injuries and withdrawals amongst the original six boxers, and the insertion of replacement boxers at different stages through the tournament.\nThe competition started with a group stage where each boxer was meant to fight three times. A boxer would be awarded three points for a win by knockout or technical knockout, two points for a win on points (or by disqualification), one point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.\nThe top four from the group stage continued to the semifinals, matching the leader against no. 4 and no. 2 against no. 3. The winners of the semifinals then proceeded to the tournament final.\nThe WBC Super Middleweight Championship and WBA Super Middleweight Championship were meant to be on the line for each of the champions' fights, resulting in the unification of the two at the conclusion of the tournament.\nAlthough this unification was potentially jeopardized by the withdrawal of former WBC champion Mikkel Kessler and the non-tournament bout between WBA (Super) Champion Andre Ward and Sakio Bika which followed the withdrawal of Andre Dirrell, both titles remained in the mix following the end of the group stage.\nGroup stage.\nGroup Stage Table.\nTop four fighters – by points – at end of the group stage will enter the Knockout stage.\nFollowing table shows final results from the group stage, after the final Group Stage bout of November 27, 2010.\nFor completeness, results for the three fighters who have withdrawn from the tournament are shown, though their relative standing in the tournament is not applicable (n/a).\n^ indicates former participant\nControversy with Group Stage 3.\nA number of developments required multiple adjustments to the original plans for Group Stage 3.\nAs of August 12, 2010, a venue had not been chosen and ticket sales had not started for the scheduled September 25, 2010, bout between Dirrell and Ward. This was expected to result in a new date for the fight. Instead, on October 7, 2010, it was reported that Andre Dirrell withdrew due to an undisclosed injury. This resulted in a decision to have Ward fight Sakio Bika in a non-tournament bout, which created the possibility that the WBA Championship could have been removed from the tournament. (Ward did defeat Bika, so the WBA Championship remained in the Super Six tournament).\nOn August 25, 2010, Mikkel Kessler withdrew from the tournament citing an eye injury. On September 6, 2010, the WBC vacated its Super Middleweight Championship, announced that Kessler will be the first contender when he returns from his injury (naming him Champion Emeritus), and announced that it would grant its championship to the winner of the upcoming Group Stage 3 match between its number one contender, Dirrell, and the WBA champion, Ward, to be followed with a mandated WBC title fight against the winner of the Froch-Abraham match.\nThe promoter for Abraham requested that the WBC rethink its determination that the WBC title should go to the winner of the Dirrell-Ward match. On October 6, 2010, a Showtime press release confirmed that the WBC would grant its championship to the winner of the rescheduled Froch-Abraham match.\nOn September 13, 2010, it was announced that Carl Froch was suffering from a back injury and would have to delay his fight with Arthur Abraham, which had been scheduled for October 2.\nOn September 29, 2010, it was reported that former IBF, IBO, Ring Magazine light heavyweight champion and former Ring Magazine Fighter of the Year Glen Johnson would replace Kessler in Group Stage 3.\nNon-Tournament Bouts.\nAs part of their contracts with Showtime regarding the Classic, fighters are able to take non-tournament bouts if their schedule permits.\nSince Andre Ward already qualified for the semifinals and his planned opponent Andre Dirrell withdrew, a decision was made to have Ward fight Sakio Bika in a non-tournament bout.\nAfter losses in his last two round robin matches, Arthur Abraham elected to take a tune-up bout with Croatian boxer Stjepan Božić before his semifinal match against Andre Ward."

For instance, a board slide or grind move may be done by placing the skateboard on the obstacle, then jumping onto the board, rather than riding the board to the obstacle and mounting it. In this latter sense, trying a trick caveman is often helpful for skateboarders to learn new techniques or methods, and often reduces the risk of injury."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball awards",
        "text": "Major League Baseball presents a variety of annual awards and trophies to recognize both its teams and its players. Three team trophies are awarded annually: one each to the National League and American League champions, and one of the champion of the World Series. Additionally, various organizations—such as the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) and the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball—present awards for such accomplishments as excellence in batting, pitching performance, fielding prowess, and community service.\nThe Most Valuable Player Award, commonly known as the \"MVP\", is the oldest individual award, given in its current format since 1931. MVP awards are also presented for performances in the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. Offensive awards include the Silver Slugger Award and the Hank Aaron Award, while the Cy Young Award and Major League Baseball Reliever of the Year Award recognize pitching; the Rawlings Gold Glove Award is given for fielding. The newest award is the All-MLB Team, introduced in 2019 to honor the best players at each position across all of MLB. Before that time, the most recently established awards were the Major League Baseball Reliever of the Year Award and Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award, both established in 2005. Additionally, the Commissioner, at his discretion, can present an Historic Achievement Award for any great contribution to the sport that he deems worthy.\nTeam awards.\nCommissioner's Trophy.\nThe Commissioner's Trophy is presented each year by the Commissioner of Baseball to the Major League Baseball team that wins the World Series. The World Series is played between the champion clubs of the American League and the National League. The \"modern\" World Series has been played every year since 1903 with the exception of 1904, which was cancelled when the NL champion New York Giants declined to play the AL champion Boston Americans, and 1994, which was cancelled due to the players' strike.\nBaseball has employed various championship formulas since the 1860s. When the term \"World Series\" is used by itself, it is usually understood to refer to the \"modern\" World Series exclusively. The World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff. Best-of-seven has been the format of nearly all of the modern World Series, except 1903 and 1919–1921 which were best-of-nine. In addition to the Commissioner's Trophy, each player on the winning team receives an individual World Series ring. The Commissioner's Trophy has been awarded to the Series winner since 1967.\nRecent trophy designs contain flags representing each team in each league. It is the only championship trophy of the four major sports in the United States that is not named after a particular person (contrasting with the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup, the National Football League's Vince Lombardi Trophy, and the National Basketball Association's Larry O'Brien Trophy). The current holders of the trophy are the Texas Rangers of the American League, who won the 2023 World Series.\nWarren C. Giles Trophy.\nThe Warren C. Giles Trophy is presented annually to the champion of the National League. The award is named for Warren Giles, who was league president from 1951 to 1969. Until 2017 the award was passed from champion to champion (like the NHL's Stanley Cup, but unlike the American League) as opposed a new trophy being created each season. Starting in 2017, an identical trophy as the American League trophy was made, and a new trophy is now made each season. Warren's son Bill Giles, the honorary league president and former part-owner of the Philadelphia Phillies, presents the trophy to the National League champion at the conclusion of each National League Championship Series. The Arizona Diamondbacks are the current holders of the Giles Trophy after beating the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2023 National League Championship Series.\nWilliam Harridge Trophy.\nThe William Harridge Trophy is the American League's counterpart to the Giles Trophy, and is presented each year to the American League champion. Prior to 2017, the trophy featured a golden eagle, the league's emblem, sitting atop a silver baseball and clutching the American League banner. Since 2017, the trophy is all silver with a pennant on top. The trophy is named for Will Harridge, who was league president from 1931 to 1958. The Texas Rangers are the current holders of the Harridge Trophy in honor of their 2023 American League Championship Series win over the Houston Astros. A new trophy is awarded each season.\nIndividual awards.\nMost Valuable Player.\nThe Most Valuable Player Award (commonly known as the MVP) is an annual award given to one outstanding player in each league of Major League Baseball. The MVP originated in 1910 as the Chalmers Award, sponsored by the Chalmers Automobile Company. Chalmers presented the award until 1914. The National and American Leagues presented their own \"League Awards\" from 1922 to 1929, after which the BBWAA began to present an unofficial award. Since 1931, it has been officially presented by the BBWAA. It was officially called the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award until 2020, following complaints from past MVP winners about Landis's role in stonewalling racial integration. The most recent award winners are Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels in the American League and Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Atlanta Braves in the National League.\nLou Gehrig Memorial Award.\nThe \"Lou Gehrig Memorial Award\" is given annually to a Major League Baseball (MLB) player who best exhibits the character and integrity of Lou Gehrig, both on the field and off it. The award was created by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in honor of Gehrig, who was a member of the fraternity at Columbia University. It was first presented in , fourteen years after Gehrig's death. The award's purpose is to recognize a player's exemplary contributions in \"both his community and philanthropy.\" The bestowal of the award is overseen by the headquarters of the Phi Delta Theta in Oxford, Ohio, and the name of each winner is inscribed onto the Lou Gehrig Award plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. It is the only MLB award conferred by a fraternity. The most recent award winner is Brandon Crawford of the San Francisco Giants.\ncodice_1\nCy Young Award.\nThe Cy Young Award is an honor given annually in baseball to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball, one each for the American and National Leagues. The award was first introduced in 1956 by Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but after Frick's retirement in 1967, the award was given to one pitcher in each league. Each league's award is voted on by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America, with two representatives from each team. The most recent award winners are Gerrit Cole of the New York Yankees in the American League and Blake Snell of the San Diego Padres in the National League.\nRookie of the Year.\nThe Rookie of the Year Award is given annually to one player from each league, as voted upon by the BBWAA. The award was established in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA who alone selected a rookie of the year. Starting in , all members of the national BBWAA organization voted. Jackie Robinson was awarded the first official Rookie of the Year award. The award was originally known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. In 1987, it was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award, in honor of the 40th year since Robinson broke the baseball color line. Only two players, both in the American League, have been named Rookie of the Year and MVP in the same year: Fred Lynn in 1975 and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The only Rookie of the Year to win the Cy Young Award in the same year was Fernando Valenzuela in 1981. In 1947 and 1948, only one award was given to a single player. Since 1949, the honor has been given to one player in each league. The most recent award winners are Gunnar Henderson of the Baltimore Orioles in the American League and Corbin Carroll of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League.\nManager of the Year.\nThe Manager of the Year Award is an honor given annually since 1983 to the best managers in the American and National Leagues. The winner is voted on by 30 members of the BBWAA. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the managers of each league. The manager with the highest score in each league wins the award. In 1991, Bobby Cox became the first manager to win the award in both leagues, winning with the Atlanta Braves and having previously won with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985. Tony La Russa, Lou Piniella, and Jim Leyland have since won the award in both leagues. Joe Girardi is the only manager to win the award with a fourth-place team (2006 Florida Marlins); he is also the only manager to win the award after fielding a team with a losing record. The 2023 award winners are Brandon Hyde of the Baltimore Orioles in the American League and Skip Schumaker of the Miami Marlins in the National League.\nAll-MLB Team.\nThe All-MLB Team, introduced following the , honors the best players at each position across all of MLB. A panel consisting of media members, former players, and baseball officials selects the honorees; fan voting is also incorporated into the selection process, with the collective fan vote having the same weight as a single panel member. First and second teams are named, each consisting of one catcher, one player at each infield position, three outfielders regardless of position, five starting pitchers, two relievers, and one designated hitter. The All-MLB Team is announced during the Winter Meetings.\nGold Glove.\nThe Rawlings Gold Glove Award, usually referred to as the Gold Glove, is the award given annually to the players judged to have exhibited superior individual fielding performances at each fielding position in both the National and American Leagues, as voted by the managers and coaches in each league. Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players. Twenty Gold Gloves are awarded each year: one at each of the nine positions, plus one for a utility player, in each league.\nSilver Slugger.\nThe Silver Slugger Award is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position in both the American League and the National League, as determined by Major League Baseball's coaches and managers. These voters consider several offensive categories in selecting the winners, including batting average, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage, in addition to \"coaches' and managers' general impressions of a player's overall offensive value\". As with the Gold Glove, the prize is presented to outfielders irrespective of their specific position, and an additional award is presented to a utility player in each league. Pitchers do not receive a Silver Slugger Award; an award is given to one designated hitter in each league, instead. \nPrior to 2022, when the designated hitter was permanently allowed across both leagues, a Silver Slugger Award for pitchers was awarded in the National League (except in 2020). \nHank Aaron Award.\nThe Hank Aaron Award is given annually to the Major League Baseball players selected as the top hitter in each league, as voted on by baseball fans and members of the media. It was introduced in 1999 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hank Aaron surpassing Babe Ruth's 714 career home runs. The award was the first major award to be introduced by Major League Baseball in more than 25 years. Each team's radio and television play-by-play broadcasters and color analysts vote for three players in each league. Their first place vote receives five points, the second place vote receives three points, and the third place vote receives one point. Beginning in 2003, fans were given the opportunity to vote via Major League Baseball's website. Fans' votes account for 30% of the points, while broadcasters' and analysts' votes account for the other 70%. The 2023 winners of the Hank Aaron Award are Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels in the American League and Ronald Acuña Jr. of the Atlanta Braves in the National League.\nComeback Player of the Year.\nThe Comeback Player of the Year Award is presented by MLB to the player who is judged to have \"re-emerged on the baseball field during a given season.\" The award was developed in 2005, as part of a sponsorship agreement between MLB and Viagra. In 2005 and 2006 representatives from MLB and MLB.com selected six candidates each from the AL and NL and one winner for each league was selected via an online poll on MLB.com. Since then, the winners have been selected by a panel of MLB beat reporters. Under the current voting structure, first-place votes are worth five points, second-place votes worth three, and third-place votes worth one, with the award going to the player with the most overall points. The 2023 award winners are Liam Hendriks of the Chicago White Sox in the American League and Cody Bellinger of the Chicago Cubs in the National League.\nWorld Series MVP.\nThe Willie Mays World Series Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player who most contributes to his team's success in the final round of the Major League Baseball post-season. The award was originally given by the editors of Sport magazine, but is now decided by a combination of media members and Major League Baseball officials. On September 29, 2017, it was renamed in honor of Willie Mays in remembrance of the 63rd anniversary of The Catch. Mays never won the award himself. The 2023 award winner was Corey Seager, shortstop for the Texas Rangers.\nLeague Championship Series MVP.\nThe League Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award is given annually to the players deemed to have the most impact on their teams' performances in each of the two respective League Championship Series that comprise the penultimate round of the MLB postseason. This series has a best-of-seven playoff format, and currently follows the Division Series. The winners of the National League Championship Series and the American League Championship Series advance to the World Series. The 2023 award winners were Ketel Marte of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League and Adolis García of the Texas Rangers in the American League.\nAll-Star Game MVP.\nThe Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award given to the most outstanding player in each year's MLB All-Star Game. Awarded each season since , it was originally called the \"Arch Ward Memorial Award\" in honor of Arch Ward, the man who conceived the All-Star Game. The award's name was changed to the \"Commissioner's Trophy\" in 1970, but this name change was reversed in 1985 when the World Series Trophy was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. Finally, the trophy was renamed the \"Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award\" in 2002, in honor of former Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year. No award was presented for the 2002 All-Star Game, which ended in a tie. In 2003, Garret Anderson of the Anaheim Angels was the first recipient of the newly named Ted Williams Award. The award was not given in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic postponing the 2020 MLB season for over three months, resulting in the 2020 All-Star Game's cancellation. The 2023 award winner was Elías Díaz of the Colorado Rockies.\nRoberto Clemente.\nThe Roberto Clemente Award is given annually to the player in Major League Baseball who \"best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual's contribution to his team\", as voted on by baseball fans and members of the media. It is named for Hall of Fame outfielder Roberto Clemente. Originally known as the Commissioner's Award, it has been presented by Major League Baseball since 1971. In 1973, the award was renamed after Clemente following his death in a plane crash while delivering supplies to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. Each year, a panel of baseball dignitaries selects 1 player from 30 nominees, one from each club. Teams choose their nominee during the regular season, and the winner is announced at the World Series. The player who receives the most votes online via MLB's official website, MLB.com, gets one vote in addition to the votes cast by the panel. Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees is the 2023 winner and current holder of the award.\nReliever of the Year.\nMajor League Baseball has awarded a Reliever of the Year Award, for one pitcher in each league, since 2014. The 2023 recipients were Félix Bautista of the Baltimore Orioles in the American League and Devin Williams of the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League.\nPreviously, MLB awarded a single Delivery Man of the Year Award, for one pitcher in all of MLB, from 2005 through 2013. The Delivery Man award was developed as part of a sponsorship agreement between MLB and package delivery company DHL Express. There was also a Delivery Man of the Month Award issued for each month of the regular season from 2005 from 2013. In 2017, MLB began a Reliever of the Month Award, for one pitcher in each league, issued for each month of the regular season.\nEdgar Martínez Award.\nThe Edgar Martínez Outstanding Designated Hitter Award, commonly referred to as the Edgar Martínez Award and originally known as the Outstanding Designated Hitter Award, has been presented annually to the most outstanding designated hitter in Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1973. It is named for Hall of Fame designated hitter Edgar Martinez. The award is voted on by club beat reporters, broadcasters, and public relations departments. All players with a minimum of 100 at bats at DH are eligible. The Associated Press discontinued the award in 2000, but it was picked up by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, which has administered it since. Until 2019, and in 2021, use of the designated hitter was allowed only in the American League (AL). In 2020 and since 2022, the designated hitter has been allowed in the National League (NL), in addition to the AL. In 2020, Marcell Ozuna of the Atlanta Braves was the first-ever winner of the award from the NL. The 2023 recipient of the annual award was Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels.\nOther awards.\nCommissioner's Historic Achievement.\nThe Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award is presented by the Commissioner of Major League Baseball to a group or individual who has made a \"major impact on the sport\" of baseball. The award consists of a trophy: a gold baseball sitting atop a silver trophy base. The award has been presented thirteen times by Commissioner Bud Selig: eleven times to players, once to a team, and once to a non-player. The award is most often presented for breaking a Major League Baseball record; it has been presented three times to players who broke the single-season home run record (Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Barry Bonds). Other record-breakers to receive the award include Ichiro Suzuki (hits in a single season), Cal Ripken Jr. (consecutive games played), Rickey Henderson (career stolen bases and career runs scored) and Mariano Rivera (career saves, both regular season and postseason; postseason ERA). The most recent recipient is Shohei Ohtani in 2021.\nMLB Lifetime Pass.\nThe Major League Baseball Lifetime Pass is a pass gifted to players, managers, coaches, umpires, and league executives, and various other people of special interest which grants them lifetime attendance to any regular season game for the remainder of their life. It also allows one guest per entry and is non-transferable. Generally, the pass is given when a player or coach spends a minimum 8 years in the league or when an executive spends at least 25 years. In addition, some people not involved with MLB have been given passes based on their merits in other areas. Most notably of which was President Theodore Roosevelt, who was the first to ever receive such as pass in 1907. Modern passes are a gold-colored alloy card with the recipients name pressed at the bottom."

The ban on competitive matches was removed in September 1918, but official games did not restart until January 1919. The season consisted of the Lancashire League and Yorkshire League, but the Championship did not restart until the 1919–20 season.\nRochdale Hornets won the Lancashire League, and Hull F.C. won the Yorkshire League. \nSeason summary.\nUnofficial competition resumed in September 1918, but due to the increasing difficulties of raising a team, and further restrictions on travel, very few clubs had arranged fixtures.\nFollowing the end of the First World War, it was agreed to restart official competition in January 1919. Clubs competed in separate Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues.\nChallenge Cup.\nThe Challenge Cup Competition was suspended for the final time following its absence during the war. The competition would return the following year.\nCounty cups.\nRochdale Hornets beat Oldham 22–0 to win the Lancashire Cup, and Huddersfield beat Dewsbury 14–8 to win the Yorkshire Cup."

        "text": "Taconic Golf Club is a semi-private golf course located in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The land that Taconic Golf Club is owned by Williams College, but an independent Board of Directors oversees the daily operation. The course has repeatedly made Golf Magazine's list of the Top 100 Courses You Can Play and Golfweek's list of top collegiate campus courses, where it was most recently ranked 3rd in 2020. Golf Digest ranks Taconic as the 9th best course in the state of Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nIn 1896, William Howard Doughty, James M. Ide, and Edward C. Gale received permission from Williams College to install three tomato cans on land adjoining what is now the 18th fairway of Taconic. In the same year, the course was expanded to seven holes; one of those holes, the present 17th, is the oldest at Taconic. In 1897, a longer nine-hole course was laid out.\nIn 1927, Wayne Stiles of Stiles &amp; Van Kleek, a Boston firm, was commissioned to design and construct an 18 hole course. Construction began in August 1927 and a par 73 layout was completed by Labor Day in 1928. The course was revised in 1955 to a 6,640 yard (gold tees) par 71 layout. In 2009, Gil Hanse completed a renovation of the course.\nCourse layout.\nMany of the greens are located on top of knolls or small hills. The property is approximately . In general, the course provides plenty of room off the tee, with the real challenge being ahead at the green. The greens are often fast, with significant slope from back to front, and it is usually preferable to remain short of the hole rather than beyond the flag stick.\nTournaments hosted.\nU.S. Junior Amateur.\nIn 1956, Harlan Stevenson of California defeated Jack Rule, Jr. of Iowa 3 and 1. Rule beat 16-year-old Jack Nicklaus in the semifinals 1 up. Nicklaus made a hole-in-one on the 14th hole at Taconic during a practice round, where an engraved rock commemorates this accomplishment."

        "text": "Grant Thomas Green (born September 27, 1987) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, San Francisco Giants, and Washington Nationals. Green attended the University of Southern California (USC) and played college baseball for the USC Trojans.\nHigh school career.\nGreen played baseball at Canyon High School in Anaheim, California. As a high school sophomore, Green batted .430 (31-for-72) with eight doubles and 22 RBI. In his junior season, he batted .455 (40-for-88) with three home runs, 30 RBI and 14 stolen bases, a performance he duplicated as a senior when he batted .453 with four home runs, 22 RBI, and 14 stolen bases. Green earned first team honors from the California Interscholastic Federation and the Orange County Register. After his senior season, he was the 14th-round draft choice of the San Diego Padres, but he opted to attend the University of Southern California (USC) instead.\nGreen also experienced success with the 2005 U.S. Junior National Team. He batted .412 with six RBI and two stolen bases at the 2005 COPABE \"AAA\" Pan Am Junior Championships in Villahermosa, Mexico.\nCollege career.\nGreen started every game for the USC Trojans as a true freshman in 2007. He batted .316 (72-for-228) with two home runs, 14 doubles, 24 RBI and six stolen bases. Green collected several postseason honors, including Pac-10 Conference Co-Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore in 2008, Green batted .390 (80-for-205) with nine home runs, 46 RBI, and 10 stolen bases. He was named a member of Baseball America's All-America third team and also earned All-Pacific-10 Conference honors.\nBefore Green's junior season, \"Baseball America\" rated him as the third best college prospect in the nation. However, Green's junior season began slowly, as he was batting only .234 after 13 games. However, he turned in an impressive performance by season's end, batting .374 (79-for-211) overall, with four home runs, 32 RBI, and 16 stolen bases in 24 attempts. He led the Trojans with a .435 on-base percentage and 26 multi-hit games.\nIn 2007, Green played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. He returned to the CCBL in 2008 to play for the Chatham Anglers, and was honored by the league as its top pro prospect. He was among the league leaders in most offensive categories but struggled defensively, committing 17 errors in 41 games.\n2009 Draft.\nAs the 2009 baseball draft approached, Green was very highly regarded among experts, who expected him to be drafted high in the first round. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft as the 13th overall selection as a shortstop. Although some scouts had projected him as a future third baseman, both Green and the Athletics stated a desire for him to remain at shortstop. Green was advised by high-profile sports agent Scott Boras. He signed a contract with a signing bonus of $2.75 million on August 17, 2009, just minutes before the deadline to sign draft picks passed.\nProfessional career.\nOakland Athletics.\nGreen played in five minor league games during the 2009 season, all at Single-A Stockton. Starting the 2010 season, he was rated as Oakland's third best prospect according to Baseball America and was a non-roster invitee to the A's spring training camp as part of his contract. He spent the entire season at Stockton and was selected for the Futures Games. He played in the Arizona Fall League in 2010. For the 2011 season, Green was moved to the outfield and played for the Double–A Midland RockHounds with a minor stint in the Triple–A playoffs. He made his MLB debut on July 8, 2013, starting at second base. He went 0-for-3 and struck out twice. He appeared in five games with the Athletics and did not record a hit.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nGreen was traded to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 30, 2013, in exchange for Alberto Callaspo. Green tallied his first two major league hits in his Angels debut on August 6. During the 2014 season Green went to bat for the Angels 99 times, compiling a .273 batting average, hitting 1 home run, and driving in 11 RBIs. During the 2015 season Green was shuffled between the Angels and their triple-A affiliate Salt Lake Bees. In his most recent stint from July 19–24 he only had one at-bat, in which he flew out. He was optioned back to Salt Lake on July 24. The Angels designated Green for assignment at the end of the 2015 season, and outrighted him to the minor leagues.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn November 30, 2015, Green signed a minor league deal with the Giants. Green began the 2016 season with the Sacramento River Cats of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League, and was promoted to the major leagues on June 30. The Giants designated him for assignment on July 28, and outrighted him to Sacramento.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn January 27, 2017, Green signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. On April 12, 2017, after injuries to Trea Turner and Stephen Drew, the Nationals called up Green to the majors. He was designated for assignment on April 21. He was released on June 14, 2017.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn June 21, 2017, Green signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on August 5, 2017.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn August 18, 2017, Green signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. In 14 games for the Triple–A New Orleans Baby Cakes, he batted .304/.340/.326 with no home runs and 8 RBI. Green elected free agency following the season on November 6.\nAcereros de Monclova.\nOn May 5, 2018, Green signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. He was released on July 3, 2018."

The tour marked the climax of the successful \"Thornett Era\" of Australian Rugby, buoyed by the leadership skills of skipper John Thornett and the outstanding abilities of greats of the game like Ken Catchpole, Peter Johnson and Rob Heming. Dick Marks and Peter Crittle also toured and would later become among the most influential administrators of Australian rugby.\nLeadership.\nFollowing their success on the 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa, team managers Bill McLaughlin and Alan Roper, together with captain John Thornett and vice-captain Ken Catchpole again led the Wallaby tour squad. Manager Bill McLaughlin was a 1936 two Test cap Wallaby, who would later serve a term a President of the Australian Rugby Union. Alan Roper was the Assistant Manager, the traditional coaching role of the touring party. Roper had been a schoolboy coach at Riverview in Sydney in the 1950s but had coached at the top-level in Australia since at least 1962 having success with the 1963 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa and again against the Springboks in a two Test domestic series in 1965.\nJohn Thornett an exceptional leader of men, was the squad captain. Thornett had at the tour's beginning already made 36 Test appearances for Australia, 15 as captain. He had been entrenched as Wallaby captain since 1962, leading the side more times than any player to that point in Australia's rugby history. He was making his eight Wallaby tour, his fourth as the team leader. With Thornett sidelined by illness early in the tour, the Wallabies were captained by half back Ken Catchpole in all but the French Test. Catchpole is considered Australia's greatest scrumhalf.\nPlayers.\n31 players toured with the 5th Wallaby squad. The team set out with 30 players, however, hooker Ross Cullen was sent home after the third tour match and was replaced by Dick Taylor. The squad had three veterans of the 4th Wallaby Tour - fullback Jim Lenehan, forward Tony Miller and skipper John Thornett - and comprised the strong nucleus of players of the Thornett Era who had taken Australia to great heights, including scrumhalf Ken Catchpole, hooker Peter Johnson, lineout specialist Rob Heming and breakaways Jules Guerassimoff and Greg Davis. Young rising stars included John Brass and John Hipwell. A number of the players would continue on to influential roles in rugby administration, including centre Dick Marks and forward Peter Crittle.\nEarly setbacks.\nAfter the Oxford University match – the 2nd match of the tour – Queensland hooker Ross Cullen was accused of biting the ear of Oxford front-rower Ollie Waldron. Waldron's ear needed treatment and McLaughlin acted to ban Cullen from the tour as punishment. Cullen was put on the next flight to Sydney and never played for his country again. The side was further rocked when skipper John Thornett contracted impetigo in a scrum, and dropped himself for the first Test.\nTest matches.\nEngland.\nThe Test marked Australia's best performance of the tour. With their halves Phil Hawthorne and Ken Catchpole in control the Wallabies gave England its heaviest defeat in 16 years.\nIreland.\nIreland's first try was scored by Alan Duggan from a crossfield kick by Rea. A drop-goal followed by Ireland's Gibson from broken play deep in Australia's territory. Kiernan soon after kicked a penalty from out wide following an Australian infringement. Gibson followed with another drop-goal after a scrum close to the Australian line. Five minutes before half-time Hawthorne responded in kind and put the Wallabies on the board. The 3–9 scoreline at the break reflected Ireland's first-half dominance.\nAustralia pressed Ireland for a period after the break but a defensive lapse saw Gibson swoop for Ireland. Then the Australian back-line chimed and Boyce scored in the corner. Jim Lenehan kicked a tremendous conversion from the sideline putting Australia back in the match with the score 8–12. Ireland withstood the Australian effort in the final minutes before Gibson again showed coolness under pressure kicking another dropped goal for a 15–8 victory to Ireland."

        "text": "The 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship was held in Poland from 30 August to 21 September 2014. The tournament featured 24 teams to determine the world champions in men's volleyball. In addition to the host nation Poland, 23 teams qualified for the tournament by means of continental and regional competitions. The matches took place in seven venues across seven Polish cities, with the final being held at Spodek, Katowice.\nThe tournament was won by the host country Poland, who beat Brazil (who won the previous three titles) in the final. Poland became the third team in the history of the competition to be crowned as champions in their own country, joining the Soviet Union (1952 and 1962) and Czechoslovakia (1966).\n563,263 fans watched the matches during the 18-day event, smashing the previous records in the competition. In Italy four years earlier, the total was 339,324, while in Japan in 2006, it was 298,352.\nHost.\nFinals hosts Poland. The tournament was held in seven Poland cities.\nInformation.\nOn 4 September 2008 the FIVB announced it had agreed a partnership deal for Poland to host the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in 2014. \"This will be the biggest and most beautiful sports event in the world, not only in volleyball but throughout the whole sports family,\" said FIVB Honorary Life President Rubén Acosta. \"Poland – I'm sure about it – will make this championship very special.\"\nAcosta and FIVB President Wei Jizhong agreed the deal in Warsaw following negotiations with the Polish Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki; Mirosław Błaszczyk, President of the Board of Administration of Polsat Television; Polsat Television Sports Department Director, Marian Kmita and Polish Volleyball Federation President, Mirosław Przedpełski.\nVolleyball in Poland has enjoyed a huge surge in popularity during the 2000s. The Polish Men's team finished as runners-up at the 2006 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship in Japan and a year later, Katowice hosted one of the best-ever FIVB Volleyball World League Final Rounds.\nThe remaining 12 teams were drawn across the bottom three positions of each of the four first round pools.\nA record number of 279 teams participated in the qualification process for the 2014 FIVB Volleyball World Championships. This total, coming from 166 national federations across the five FIVB confederations, represents an increase of 65 teams from the previous best of 214 teams from 119 federations for the 2010 World Championships (compared with 102 in 2006, 72 in 2002 and 63 in 1998).\nQualification.\nThe regional qualification stage determined the 24 teams that would compete in the championship competition. Hosts Poland were granted automatic qualification. Regional governing bodies were allocated the remaining 23 spots. Africa was granted three, Asia and Oceania four, Europe eight, North America five, and South America three places.\nPools composition.\nFirst round.\nTeams were seeded in the first three positions of each pool following the serpentine system according to their FIVB World Ranking as of 7 October 2013. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pool A regardless of the World Ranking. All teams not seeded were drawn to take other available positions in the remaining lines, following the World Ranking. The draw was held in Warsaw, Poland on 27 January 2014. Because the CAVB and NORCECA qualification process were in progress on 27 January 2014, the best world rankings of CAVB (13, 15 and 19) and NORCECA (4, 7, 11, 20 and 22) were used when the draw was made. Rankings are shown in brackets except the hosts who ranked 5th.\nThird round.\nThe third round draw was held in Łódź, Poland on 14 September 2014. The 1st ranked teams of pools E and F were placed in different pools, while the second and third placed teams were drawn.\nVenues.\nIt was the first time Poland had hosted an FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship. Matches were played in Kraków, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Katowice, Łódź, Bydgoszcz and Warsaw.\nPool standing procedure.\nMatch won 3–0 or 3–1: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser&lt;br&gt;\nMatch won 3–2: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser\nOpening match.\nThe 2014 World Championship began on 30 August with a dream opening match between the hosts and Serbia, who played to a record 62,000 spectators at National Stadium, Warsaw.\nMarketing.\nOfficial song.\nThe competition's official opening song was \"Start a Fire\" by Margaret. She also performed the song at the 2014 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship opening ceremony on August 30 in National Stadium, Warsaw, prior to the Poland v. Serbia match. This event was transmitted in over 168 countries.\nTrophy.\nThe FIVB then mandated two young product designers from Switzerland, Thilo Alex Brunner and Jörg Mettler to create the new World Championship trophy. With its unique contemporary design, the trophy has set itself apart from other awards in international competitions across the sporting world. Eichenberger LTD and their mastermind, Juan Franco, have been responsible for its production. The company specialises in complex metal works mainly for the Swiss watchmaking and jewellery industry.\nFans.\nMore than a half million fans (563,263) have watched the matches so far, smashing the previous records in the competition. In Italy four years ago, the total was 339,324, while in Japan in 2006 it was 298,352.\nThe first round alone topped the numbers achieved by the World Championship in Italy four years ago.\nThe average number of spectators per match was 5,469. Not surprisingly, Poland have been the most popular team with a total of 173,234 fans attending their games, 60,000 more than the second-ranked team Serbia."

        "title": "Cycling at the 1924 Summer Olympics – Men's sprint",
        "text": "The men's sprint event was part of the track cycling programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The field consisted of 31 cyclists from 17 countries. The Vélodrome de Vincennes track was a loop. The event was won by Lucien Michard of France, the nation's third victory in the men's sprint. His teammate Jean Cugnot earned bronze. Jacob Meijer of the Netherlands took silver, putting the Dutch team on the podium for the second consecutive Games. \nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. The only returning semifinalist from 1920 was gold medal winner Maurice Peeters of the Netherlands. Peeters had also won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1920. He was one of the favorites along with William Fenn of the United States and 1923 World Champion Jean Cugnot of France.\nArgentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, and Switzerland each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its fifth appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThere were 12 first-round heats, with up to three cyclists in each. The top cyclist in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals (12 cyclists), while all other finishers went to the first repechage (18 cyclists, with one man eliminated because he did not finish his heat). In the first repechage, there were six heats of three cyclists each, with the winners advancing to the quarterfinals (6 cyclists, joining the 12 already qualified) and everyone else eliminated. The 18 quarterfinalists were divided into six heats of three cyclists each. The winner advanced directly to the semifinals (6 cyclists), while the other cyclists went to a second repechage (12 cyclists). The second repechage featured three heats of four cyclists each, with the winners advancing to the semifinals (3 cyclists, joining the 6 already qualified) and all others eliminated. The semifinals were three heats of three cyclists each, with winners advancing to the three-man final and others eliminated.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new Olympic record was set during the competition.\nResults.\nSource:\nRound 1.\nThe top finisher in each heat qualified for the quarterfinals. All other cyclists went to the first repechage for a second chance at quarterfinal qualifying.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe 18 winners of the first round and first repechage competed in the quarterfinals. Again, the winner of each heat advanced (this time to the semifinals) while the other cyclists competed in another repechage.\nSemifinals.\nThe nine remaining cyclists competed in three semifinals, with the winners advancing to the finals and the losers eliminated.\nFinal.\nThe final three cyclists competed for the three medals."

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891",
        "text": "In the 1891 English cricket season, Somerset County Cricket Club returned to first-class cricket after a five-year absence. They competed in the County Championship, which had been established the previous year, for the first time. Somerset began the season poorly, drawing one and losing two of their opening three fixtures, after which there were some comments in the press questioning whether the club deserved to be playing first-class cricket. A victory over Kent in their next game shifted opinion in their favour, and another win later in the season over Surrey, who won the County Championship in both 1890 and 1891, gained them further plaudits. Overall, Somerset won five, lost six and drew one of their County Championship matches, and finished fifth in the table, level with Kent.\nThe Somerset team predominantly consisted of amateur batsmen, supported by two professional bowlers. Lionel Palairet led Somerset's batting in terms of both runs and average during the County Championship season, scoring 560 runs at an average of 31.11, and was also the only Somerset player to score a century during 1891. Somerset's professional bowlers, George Nichols and Ted Tyler, along with an amateur all-rounder, Sammy Woods, did almost all of the bowling for the county; Woods led the bowling tables with 72 wickets at an average of 17.08.\nBackground.\nSomerset County Cricket Club was founded in 1875 but struggled to establish itself amongst the leading cricketing counties over the subsequent decade. For four seasons, from 1882 until 1885, the county side is considered by modern records to have been of first-class status, though contemporary publications were not unanimous in that classification. Nonetheless, even those publications that had counted Somerset among the first-class counties agreed that the club no longer deserved it after 1885, due to a string of heavy losses and matches in which Somerset could not field a full team of eleven players. Meetings were held at the club, and Henry Murray-Anderdon took over as secretary. Under his leadership, Somerset made significant improvements to their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, until Murray-Anderdon was satisfied that \"opponents will want to come here and play\". In addition to improving the ground, the secretary targeted university players to add talent to the team, such as the brothers Lionel and Richard Palairet, Vernon Hill and Sammy Woods, and added two professional bowlers, George Nichols and Ted Tyler.\nIn 1890, Somerset played thirteen fixtures against other county sides, winning twelve and tying the other, against Middlesex. Nichols and Tyler claimed over 200 wickets between them, and Somerset won the 'Second-class County Championship'. In August 1890, the County Cricket Council, which was responsible for the classification of county sides at the time, kept Somerset among the second-class counties for 1891. At the council's annual general meeting in December of that year, Herbie Hewett, the club captain, and Thomas Spencer, the joint secretary, were among the voices which led the County Cricket Council to dissolve, and allowed each county to arrange its fixtures. The next day, a meeting of the county secretaries at Lord's unanimously voted for Somerset to be admitted to the first-class County Championship, and Somerset scheduled a twelve-match fixture list, consisting of home-and-away fixtures against six of the eight other first-class counties: Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire, Middlesex, Surrey and Yorkshire. During a subsequent gathering in Taunton, Spencer explained that the decision to restrict their fixture list to twelve matches, which meant they did not face either Nottinghamshire or Sussex, was primarily a financial decision. In their preview of the season, \"\" described this as \"a sufficiently heavy task\", which was \"onerous enough to try thoroughly their capacity to maintain a place in the front rank\".\nSquad.\nDuring the 1891 season, twenty-two players appeared for Somerset across the club's twelve County Championship matches. Three players appeared in all twelve matches: the captain, Hewett, and the two professional bowlers, Nichols and Tyler. Although the county was able to field eleven players in all their matches, they still missed some of their better players occasionally, generally due to business or university commitments. Such a situation led to the joint secretary, Spencer, making his first-class debut against Yorkshire in July. Team selection was decided by a six-member panel consisting of the captain, both secretaries and three appointed members from the club's general committee. This sometimes made it difficult when last-minute team changes were necessary due to player unavailability, as it was not always possible to reconvene the whole selection committee.\nSomerset's bowling resources were limited; only Nichols, Tyler and Woods were recognised bowlers, and between them claimed 169 of the county's 179 wickets. Recognising the reliance Somerset placed on him, Woods bowled slower than he had done earlier in his career. Ron Roberts, the author of a history of Somerset cricket, praised the variation this provided in Woods' bowling, as Woods finished the season as the club's leading bowler by both wickets taken, 72, and bowling average, 17.08. In their summary of the season, the \"Taunton Courier\" noted that none of Nichols, Tyler and Woods particularly shone, blaming their heavy workload: \"This is not surprising, for the other five men tried with the ball only delivered a hundred overs between them.\" Despite only playing 10 of the 12 County Championship matches, Lionel Palairet was the club's leading run-scorer by over 200 runs, getting 560 runs at an average of 31.11, and was the only player to score a century for Somerset in 1891.\nHewett and Woods also played in representative cricket in 1891; both appeared for the Gentlemen of England and toured North America as part of Lord Hawke's XI at the end of the season, while Woods also played two matches for the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players fixture, and appeared for the South of England cricket team.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in the County Championship. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (18 May 1891).\nCounty Championship.\nSomerset began their County Championship campaign with a trip to London to face Middlesex in a match heavily affected by rain. There was no play on the first and last days of the three-day game and just under five hours on the other. Somerset's opening batsmen, Hewett and Gerald Fowler, scored some quick runs, but ultimately with so much time lost the match was drawn. Two weeks later, Somerset returned to London to face Surrey, the 1890 county champions. Somerset were missing some key players, including Woods and both Palairet brothers. Surrey batted first and scored 449 runs on the first day; Tyler bowled 80 overs, while Nichols bowled 71.3. Somerset collapsed twice in response, scoring 37 runs in each innings and losing the match by an innings and 375 runs. As of 2023, the defeat remains Somerset's fourth-largest innings loss. Somerset hosted Lancashire for their third match of the season. The visitors won the toss and batted first, accruing 210 runs. Somerset then scored 128 runs in their first innings, led by a score of 37 from Lionel Palairet. Their low total meant that for the second successive match, they had to follow-on. Batting again on day two, \"The Manchester Guardian\" reported that \"at no time did [Somerset] look like escaping a severe beating.\" Some attacking batting from Woods helped Somerset to a total of 132, a lead of 50 runs. Lancashire scored the requisite runs in under 45 minutes to win by nine wickets. \"The Times\" remarked that Somerset's play in their opening three matches was disappointing, given their success the previous year, while \"The Sportsman\" was less kind, saying after Somerset's loss to Surrey that they were \"first-class in classification... at least for the remainder of the season\".\nIn mid-July, Somerset travelled to Kent and achieved their first win of 1891. Strong bowling performances from Woods, who took five wickets, and Nichols, who bowled 17 maiden overs, helped limit Kent to 106 runs in their first innings. Lionel Palairet scored 79 runs in Somerset's response, while Challen batted for almost two-and-a-half hours to score 41 runs. Somerset reached 218 runs in the first innings and then bowled Kent out once more for 160 runs, during which Tyler took five wickets. Somerset lost five wickets in their second innings chasing down the target but secured both their first win, and Kent's first loss, of the season. Later that month against Gloucestershire, Somerset again managed to dismiss their opponents for a low total; Woods took six wickets as Gloucestershire were restricted to 94 runs. Three Somerset batsmen then scored half-centuries in their first innings—Lionel Palairet scored 53, Richard Palairet 74, and Tyler 62—to help Somerset to a total of 236. In Gloucestershire's second innings, Nichols bowled economically and claimed five wickets for 33 runs as the visiting team could only level the scores, leaving Lionel Palairet to score one run in the fourth innings of the match to win it for Somerset. During their sixth match of the season, against Yorkshire, Somerset lost the toss for the fifth consecutive game. Yorkshire batted first and scored 291; Woods and Tyler took four wickets each. In reply, Somerset's opening pair of Hewett and Lionel Palairet started well, sharing a partnership of 56, but they ended up as the county's top scorers with 39 and 76 runs respectively, and Somerset finished on 220, 71 runs in arrears. Yorkshire scored even more runs in their second innings, thanks to a century from George Ulyett, and left Somerset requiring 387 runs to win. No Somerset batsmen managed to establish themselves; Hill was the highest scorer in the innings with 30 runs, and Yorkshire won the match by 262 runs.\nHaving played all six of their season's opponents once, Somerset held a record of two wins, three losses and a draw, and began their return fixtures at home against Kent on 30 July. The wicket had been affected by heavy rain in the twenty-four hours before the match, which made batting difficult for both sides in the first innings. Somerset scored 101; only the Palairet brothers and Nichols made double-figure scores, while Kent scored 96. Somerset then added another 189 runs in the second innings; Crescens Robinson scored a half-century to help the county recover from being 100 for eight. Kent subsequently reached their target of 198 runs to beat Somerset by four wickets. In their next match, Somerset visited Yorkshire. The hosts batted first, and started poorly, losing three batsmen for the addition of just 13 runs. One of these, Robert Frank, had to retire hurt after being hit in the hand by a high full toss bowled by Woods and took no further part in the match. Woods ultimately took five wickets in the first innings to help limit Yorkshire to 175 runs; he was also key to Somerset's first-innings batting, being one of two players, along with Lionel Palairet, to score half-centuries as the visitors scored 201. Woods was again prolific in Yorkshire's second innings, taking six more wickets to finish the match with eleven in total, one of two ten-wicket hauls taken by Somerset bowlers that season. Yorkshire were dismissed for 116 runs, and Somerset then scored 91 runs to win by six wickets. Travelling to Manchester to face Lancashire, Somerset had the worst of the batting conditions; stormy weather delayed the start of the match and made batting difficult in Somerset's first innings, though the report in \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\" praised their score of 156 as \"a creditable achievement\" given the conditions. Tyler took five wickets in Lancashire's response, as the hosts scored 215. Somerset struggled at the start of their second innings, losing four wickets for 44 runs before another rain shower stopped play. Batting again the next morning on a difficult pitch, Somerset collapsed to 92 all out, and Lancashire scored the 31 runs they needed to win by eight wickets.\nThe day after completing their match against Lancashire in Manchester, Somerset returned to Taunton to face Surrey. To that point in the 1891 season, Surrey were undefeated in first-class matches and were considered champions-elect. Somerset's County Ground was full, with an estimated 3,500 people present on the first day. Somerset batted first, and on a good surface put on 194 runs for the first innings, of which Hewett got the highest score with 55. Surrey only scored 154 on their first attempt, but did avoid having to follow-on, which had looked likely at one stage. In Somerset's second innings they scored 331, based on a good team batting performance; nine of the ten players who batted hit double figures, led by Challen's 89 and Lionel Palairet's 60. Surrey needed 372 runs to win, but there were only five hours left in the match, so they batted defensively, playing for a draw. Surrey's top order batsmen played stoically, and Surrey had five wickets remaining with half an hour left to play; Walter Read scored 94 runs for the visitors. Woods and Tyler then took three wickets in short order and with eight minutes to go Woods bowled out Read. Woods then collected his fifth wicket of the innings in either the final or penultimate over of the day's play and Somerset won by 130 runs. Somerset's victory was roundly praised in the national media, typified by a comment in \"The Standard\" that the victory \"finally settled any doubt which may have remained as to their right to stand in the first rank.\" Somerset's gate receipts for the match were by a wide margin the largest of the season; they collected over against Surrey, while their next highest total was £87, against Yorkshire.\nIn their penultimate County Championship match of the season, Somerset batted first in wet conditions and scored 255, including the team's only century of the season; Lionel Palairet scored exactly 100 runs. Woods and Tyler then bowled unchanged for just over 14 overs to bowl Gloucestershire out for 25, which was their lowest first-class total to that point. Batting again in the follow-on, Gloucestershire could not surpass Somerset's first-innings total. Tyler claimed ten wickets in the match, and Somerset won by an innings and 130 runs. Somerset's final game of the season was at home to Middlesex, who batted first and scored 254. In reply, Somerset could not avoid the follow-on: despite a quick 65 runs from Hewett, they fell three runs short with 172 and had to bat again. On a drying wicket that favoured the bowlers, Somerset was dismissed again for 124 runs. After a rain delay, Middlesex scored the necessary runs to win by nine wickets. Somerset finished the County Championship season with five wins, six losses and a draw, placing them joint-fifth in the table with Kent. Team batting and bowling tables compiled by \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\" showed the overall weakness of Somerset's bowling attack; while they ranked fourth in the batting table, they were second-from-last (eighth) in the bowling averages. In the same summary, they noted that Somerset recorded a statistical quirk, as both the largest and smallest innings totals in that year's competition were scored against them: Surrey's 449 and Gloucestershire's 25.\nOther first-class.\nMatch log.\nIn addition to their County Championship fixtures, Somerset played one other first-class fixture, against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The side sent by the MCC was described as \"a very moderate side\" by \"Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game\", while Somerset were missing Woods. Somerset batted first and scored 228, led by Fowler with 51 runs. The MCC then batted twice in a row, after being forced to follow-on, and scored 114 and 140. Tyler took nine wickets between the two innings, while Fowler took six in the second innings. Somerset won the match by six wickets after scoring the additional 28 runs needed in their second innings.\nAftermath.\nAt the end-of-season annual general meeting, the Somerset committee expressed their pleasure at both the playing and financial results for the season; both subscriptions and gate receipts had increased, combining to over . Their performance over the season was praised in the press; the \"Yorkshire Herald\" said Somerset \"have fully justified their fit inclusion in the first-class ranks\", while similar sentiments were expressed in the \"Coventry Evening Telegraph\" and, more locally, the \"Bath Chronicle\". In his book \"A History of Cricket\", H. S. Altham writes that: \"From the moment they appeared in the competition, Somerset won popularity as a sporting and attractive side.\"\nAll the players except for Wilfrid Young, who was travelling abroad, were expected to be available the following year. They noted the need for another professional bowler to support Nichols, Tyler and Woods, and although they did not secure another such a professional, they did add Coote Hedley, an amateur all-rounder with genuine bowling ability. In 1892, Somerset played a full fixture list against all of the other eight first-class counties, and finished the season with eight wins and five losses, placing third in the Championship table, a position they would not equal again until 1958."

        "title": "List of Tour de France general classification winners",
        "text": "The Tour de France is an annual road bicycle race held over 23 days in July. Established in 1903 by newspaper \"L'Auto\", the Tour is the best-known and most prestigious of cycling's three \"Grand Tours\"; the others are the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a España. The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi), passing through France and neighbouring countries such as Belgium. The race is broken into day-long stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The course changes every year, but has always finished in Paris; since 1975, it has finished along the Champs-Élysées.\nThe rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the yellow jersey, representing the leader of the general classification. There are other jerseys as well: the green jersey, worn by the leader of the points classification; the polka dot jersey, worn by the leader of the mountains classification; and the white jersey, worn by the leader of the young rider classification.\nJacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, and Miguel Indurain, have won the most Tours with five each. Indurain is the only man to win five consecutive Tours. Henri Cornet is the youngest winner; he won in 1904, just short of his 20th birthday. Firmin Lambot is the oldest winner, he was 36 years, 4 months old when he won in 1922. French cyclists have won the most Tours; 21 cyclists have won 36 Tours among them. Belgian cyclists are second with 18 victories, and Spanish riders are third with 12 wins. The most recent winner is Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard, who won the 2023 Tour.\nAfter it emerged that Lance Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs, in October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) stripped Armstrong of the seven consecutive Tour general classification titles between 1999 and 2005.\nHistory.\nThe Tour de France was established in 1903 by the newspaper \"L'Auto\", in an attempt to increase its sales. The first race was won by Frenchman Maurice Garin. He won again the next year, but was disqualified after allegations that he had been transported by car or rail arose. Henri Cornet became the winner after the dispute was settled; he is the youngest to win the Tour. Following the scandals in 1904, the scoring system was changed from being time-based to a point-based system, in which the cyclist who has the fewest points at the end of the race is victorious. This system lasted until 1912, when the time-based system was re-introduced. French cyclists were successful in the early Tours; the first non-Frenchman to win the Tour was François Faber of Luxembourg, who won in 1909.\nBelgian riders were more successful before and after the First World War (which suspended the Tour from 1915 to 1918). In the 1920s, trade teams dominated the Tour; cyclists such as Nicolas Frantz won the Tour with the Alcyon team. However, when Alcyon cyclist Maurice De Waele won the Tour in 1929 while ill, the organisers decided to introduce national teams the following year, to stop team tactics from undermining the race. Because of the Second World War, the Tour de France was suspended from 1940 to 1946.\nAfter the Second World War, no one dominated the Tour until Louison Bobet, who won three consecutive Tours from 1953 to 1955—he was the first person to achieve this feat. This was bettered by the French cyclist Jacques Anquetil, who won four successive Tours from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil, who also won in 1957, became the first to win five Tours. Anquetil's five victories were matched when Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx won four successive Tours from 1969 to 1972 and the 1974 Tour. Merckx is the only person to have won the general, points and king of the mountains classifications in the same Tour. He achieved this in 1969, when he won his first Tour.\nMerckx looked to be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, becoming the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so. In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race as well as the one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.\nAmerican Greg LeMond became the first non-European to win the Tour in 1986. LeMond missed out in 1987 and 1988, but returned in 1989 to win the Tour by finishing eight seconds ahead of Laurent Fignon, the smallest winning margin in the Tour's history. LeMond also won in 1990. In 1991, Spaniard Miguel Indurain won his first Tour. Indurain came to dominate the Tour, winning four more Tours consecutively—making him the first person to win five consecutive Tours. He tried to win a record-high sixth Tour in 1996, but was beaten by Bjarne Riis, who later admitted to using Erythropoietin. Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani won in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, Pantani's victory was overshadowed by doping scandals.\nThe 1999 Tour saw the first victory of Lance Armstrong, which was followed by six more, for a total of seven consecutive victories. He was later stripped of his titles in October 2012, when it emerged he had used performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his career, including the Tour de France victories. Floyd Landis won the Tour in 2006, but was later stripped of his title, after a drug-control test demonstrated the presence of a skewed testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. Óscar Pereiro was subsequently awarded the victory. Alberto Contador won the 2007 Tour with the . The 2007 Tour was also marred by doping scandals, thus Contador was unable to defend his title in 2008, as his Astana team was banned for its part in the controversy. Fellow Spaniard Carlos Sastre of won. Contador and Astana returned in 2009 to regain the title. He won the Tour again in 2010, but was later stripped of his title after he was found guilty of doping. Runner-up Andy Schleck was awarded the victory.\nCadel Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour in 2011. The following year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour. Chris Froome became the second successive British winner in 2013, which was the 100th edition of the race. He could not defend his title the following year, as he crashed out in stage 5, with Vincenzo Nibali winning his first Tour. Froome regained the title in 2015 and then successfully defended it in 2016, the first rider in over 20 years to do so. Froome won the Tour for a third consecutive year in 2017. He was unsuccessful in his attempts to win a fourth Tour in succession in 2018 edition, Froome's teammate, Geraint Thomas, was the winner instead. Thomas was unable to win for a second year in succession in 2019. He finished second behind his teammate Egan Bernal, who became the first Colombian cyclist to win the Tour.\nThe 2020 Tour was postponed to commence on 29 August, following the French government's extension of a ban on mass gatherings after the worldwide COVID-19 outbreak. This was the first time since the end of World War II that the Tour de France was not held in the month of July. It was won by Tadej Pogačar, who became the first Slovenian rider to win the race as well as one of the youngest winners in Tour history. He repeated as champion in the 2021 edition. The following year, Jonas Vingegaard became the first Danish rider since 1996 to win the race. Vingegaard won again the following year; he won the 2023 edition by 7 minutes and 29 seconds from Pogačar.\nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\nThe following riders have won the Tour de France on more than one occasion.\nAlberto Contador won three Tours, but was stripped of one following an anti-doping violation.\nLance Armstrong was removed from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour victories stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences.

        "text": "The men's vault competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 20, 22 and 29th at the Georgia Dome. There were 105 competitors from 31 nations, with nations in the team event having up to 7 gymnasts (under the \"7-6-5\" system unique to 1996, teams had 7 gymnasts, designated 6 for each apparatus with 5 to count; however, all 7 could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes) and other nations having up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Alexei Nemov of Russia, the nation's first victory in the men's vault after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Yeo Hong-Chul gave South Korea its third consecutive podium appearance in the event, this time with silver. Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus was the fifth man to win multiple medals in the vault, adding bronze to his 1992 gold.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Five of the eight finalists from 1992 returned: gold medalist Vitaly Scherbo of the Unified Team (now for Belarus), silver medalist Hrihoriy Misyutin of the Unified Team (now for Ukraine), fourth-place finisher Li Xiaoshuang of China, and fifth-place finisher Zoltán Supola and seventh-place finisher Szilveszter Csollány of Hungary. Alexei Nemov was the two-time defending world champion, with Misyutin sharing the 1995 world title with him. Scherbo had won in 1994, taking bronze in 1995, and finished fourth in 1996.\nArmenia, Barbados, Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the men's vault. The United States made its 17th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 vault and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). The 1996 gymnastics competition introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. However, all 7 could compete on each apparatus for individual competition purposes. Other nations could enter up to 3 individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus (except for any apparatus in which a team member was not competing). The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around qualifying score for those gymnasts competing on every apparatus. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 105th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise. For the vault, the final consisted of two attempts per gymnast, with the average score of the two counting.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nThere were 105 gymnasts that competed in the vault event during the compulsory and optional rounds on July 20 and 22. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 29. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final.\nFinal.\nThe average score of the two vaults was the final score."

He went in the 10th New Zealand contingent to the Boer War, and played rugby there.\nHe won Auckland selection later than his brother Richard did, but by 1907 was firmly established in the Auckland side.\nRugby league career.\nWynyard was selected to be part of the professional All Blacks 1907–08 tour of Australia and Great Britain. He was one of the last two players selected, along with Charlie Dunning, and joined the squad late during the first Australian leg of the tour. Wynyard became a valuable member of the squad, scoring six tries, however injury meant he had to wait until the squad returned to Australia to make his test debut, playing in the first ever trans-Tasman test which was the debut match of the Australia national rugby league team. He played in two of the test matches against Australia.\nUnlike many of the touring party Wynyard opted not to return to a professional contract in Britain and instead stayed in New Zealand to help establish rugby league. He, along with his brother, helped found the North Shore Albions Rugby League Club – which broke away from the North Shore Rugby Club. He largely acted as a coach and selector for the North Shore club though he did come out of retirement to play a match for them in Round 7 of the 1913 season and scored a try in a 10–7 win.\nLater years.\nWhen the New Zealand Rugby League was formed on 25 April 1910 Wynyard was elected to the New Zealand Council. He served as a New Zealand selector between 1910 and 1919. He was also an active member of the North Shore Rowing Club and was a founder of the Devonport Orphans' Club. For 34 years he was connected with the firm of P/ Hayman and Sons, Ltd.\nWynyard later became the President of the New Zealand Rugby League and was made the organisations first life member.\nHe died at his home at 22 May Street, Devonport, Auckland leaving behind a wife, 4 daughters and 2 sons."

His older brother George Tyler also played rugby for City and Auckland, and represented the All Blacks 36 times from 1903 to 1906. \nRugby Football.\nHe started his career playing rugby union for the City Club in Auckland. Tyler was a Scrum-Half but also played at Wing-Forward, a position that had already been abandoned in other countries. Aged 25, he was selected for Auckland in 1905 and was part of the team that won the Ranfurly Shield from Wellington. Tyler had scored the winning try and was well known for this deed.\nRugby League.\nIn 1907 Tyler joined the professional All Blacks in their tour of Great Britain and Australia. Like the rest of the touring party Tyler was banned for life by the New Zealand Rugby Union. While on tour he played in six test matches and scored the match winning try in the third test against Great Britain. He then played in the first ever trans-Tasman test which was the debut match of the Australia national rugby league team. In all tour games Tyler scored three tries.\nFollowing the tour's return to New Zealand Tyler became one of the founding member of the Ponsonby United Rugby League Club in 1908 alongside fellow tourist Charles Dunning. He also played for Auckland and was part of the first ever provincial rugby league match in New Zealand, in which Auckland defeated Wellington 16-14.\nDeath.\nTyler died while under anaesthetic due to respiratory failure. He had been ill for quite some time. He was working as a blacksmith and living at Nihotupu in West Auckland at the time of his death. He was buried at Waikaraka Cemetery (Area 3, Block 8, Plot 109)."

Kelly played a club game in Nelson and, winning the bet, received \"liberal expenses\". His form was so impressive that Nelson selectors reportedly offered him a place in the teams Seddon Shield representative side. This led to the story of what had happened getting out and the New Zealand Rugby Union charged him with professionalism, which would have resulted in a lifetime ban from rugby union. The charge could not be proven but instead he was found guilty of playing under an assumed name and was banned for three years. This left him eager to accept opportunities to play rugby elsewhere.\nRugby League.\nAs a result, Kelly joined the professional All Blacks in their tour of Great Britain and Australia, ironically receiving the lifetime ban from the New Zealand Rugby Union that he had narrowly avoided earlier. He was one of six players from the Petone Rugby Club selected. He played in three test matches on the tour and scored the first try in the first ever rugby league test match against Wales, his only try of the tour.\nHe returned to New Zealand with the touring party but signed with St. Helens in December and returned to Great Britain. He was St. Helens first ever overseas signing. He became a popular figure in St Helens and this led to the club signing another of the touring team, Hubert Turtill.\nKelly later became the captain and player-coach of the \"A\" Team and led them to win the Lancashire Shield in 1913–14.\nOn the outbreak of War Kelly joined the \"Corps of Colonials\" in the British Army. Kelly survived the War and lived out his later years in Oldham. He died in Oldham in 1965."

        "text": "Tom \"Angry\" William Cross was a New Zealand rugby footballer who represented New Zealand in both rugby union and rugby league.\nEarly years.\nCross worked as a labourer and while in Petone worked at the Gear Meat Works.\nRugby football.\nCross was originally from Dunedin and played rugby union for the Kaikorai Club in 1896. Cross was considered a very large man for the times and he represented Otago from 1898 to 1900. He then joined the Linwood club in Christchurch and represented Canterbury from 1901 to 1902, gaining South Island selection in 1902. By 1903 he had moved to Wellington and played for both the Poneke and Petone Rugby Clubs. In his fourth match for Poneke against Melrose on May 23, 1903, he dislocated his shoulder and was taken to hospital. He had been named to play in his Wellington debut against Wairarapa but due to the injury was unable to. He also played for Wellington Province twice in 1905 against New Zealand on July 29 and Australia on August 19. On September 3 he played in the test match against Australia which New Zealand won 14–3. He scored near the posts with the try converted to set the final score. Cross was injured during the match and missed several representative matches for Wellington over the subsequent weeks. When in Wellington he also played for the North Island, being one of the first players to have represented both Islands. He ended his rugby union career on a sour note, being sent off for foul play in a club match and subsequently suspended for the rest of the season. The incident occurred on July 13 in a match against St James. He alleged that he had been kicked whilst on the ground and got up and attempted to strike his opponent though no blow as landed. The referee sent him off immediately despite his protests. He then joined the New Zealand Northern Union (rugby league) team which had been organised by Albert Henry Baskerville soon after and departed for England on August 9 with the side.\nCross made his All Blacks debut in 1901 and won selection again in 1904 and 1905. At the time he was regarded as one of the \"hard men\" of New Zealand rugby.\nRugby league.\nBeing an excellent support player despite his large size made him an automatic selection for the professional All Blacks in their 1907–08 tour of Great Britain and Australia. He was one of six players from the Petone Rugby Club selected. While on tour Cross played in all eight test matches and, along with Wright, Johnston and Pearce, made up the core of the forward pack during the tour. He was sent off in the third test match against the Northern Union but scored a try in the second test against Australia.\nHe returned from the tour in June 1908. In April, 1909 he narrowly escaped death at the Gear Meat Company in Petone when extension work they were carrying out saw scaffolding and steel beams collapse. One of the beams killed an employee and Cross and one other were seriously injured. It was said afterwards that he would not play again but he appeared for Wellington in their match with Taranaki on October 2 at the Petone ground, and against Auckland on October 9, 1909, at Victoria Park, where he scored a try in a 22–19 win. This was the first of only five victories for Wellington over Auckland in over 100 years. Cross retired after the 1909 season.\nLike five other members of the touring party Cross is buried at Karori Cemetery.\nLegacy.\nIn 1926 a benefit match was played for Cross between his former Poneke and Petone rugby clubs as he was seriously ill. Petone won the match 21-6 before a crowd of 3,000. It was reported in 1928 that he was in hospital suffering from \"spinal trouble\". \nCross died on July 3, 1930, aged just 54 at the Wellington Public Hospital. Comments and obituaries appeared for him in several newspapers from areas where he had played. The Kaikorai club senior side wore white armbands in their match against Varsity B in the weekend following his death in his memory.\nCross was named in the in the Petone Panthers' Team of the Century in 2012. Although bizarrely it appears he did not play for them at all as he was 32 when he returned from the tour of Australia and England and then suffered his accident early in 1909 and took some time to recover. He was present at the meeting which formed the club on Wednesday, September 16, 1908. And was elected on to the committee. However the club did not amount to anything at this point and it was years before they began playing games in 1912."

The events were originally referred to as the FIBA Americas Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament and the FIBA Junior World Championship.\nThe usual sequence is for the U18 team to play in a regional championship in one year, with the top four qualifying teams being invited to the FIBA Under-19 World Championship in the following year, as the U19 team. The first Junior World Championship was held in 1985, without a qualifying tournament in the prior year. Starting in 1988, the events were on a four-year cycle, with the FIBA Americas Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament in 1988, followed by the FIBA Junior World Championship in 1989.

The USA then went on a 7–0 run to open up a 10-point lead with under three minutes to go. Russia scored five quick points to cut the lead but Collier scored and Russia was unable to come back. The USA won 78–70 to win the gold-medal for the event. Wilson scored 30 points to set a USA record for a U19 game. That performance helped her earn the MVP award for the event. She along with teammate Collier were named to the five player all-tournament squad.\n2016 U18 results.\nThe 2016 FIBA Americas U18 Championship was held in Valdivia, Chile July 13–17, 2016. In May 2016, the USA Basketball organization selected 30 players to attend Team Trials at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. After three days of trials, twelve players were selected to represent the US at the Americas championship.\nThe twelve players representing the USA were:\nThe team members returned to the training center in July to continue training for the competition, including scrimmages against the Japan Women's U24 National Team.\nThe opening game was against Guatemala. The USA team took advantage of a 7-inch average height differential to overpower the Guatemala team. The USA team scored the first 14 points of the game and cruised to an easy 117–32 victory. The second game, against Brazil, was much more competitive especially at the beginning. USA was down 8–2 in the early minutes. The game was tied at 13 points apiece when the USA went on a run to take a nine-point lead at the end of the first quarter. The second half started like the first with Brazil scoring the first six points of the half in cutting the lead to six points before the USA expanded the lead. While the USA only scored 20 points in the final quarter their defense held Brazil to 16, leading to a final score in favor the US, 80–59.\nThe USA had a relatively easy time in the final preliminary match against Venezuela, more than doubling up the score, and winning 110–52. That victory place them into the semi-finals against Puerto Rico, and the results were even more lopsided. The USA one easily 104–36. That set up the gold-medal game against Canada. The USA had only a three-point margin at the end of the first quarter extended that in the second quarter but put the game away in the third quarter when they outscored Canada 33–14.

        "title": "Australia at the Baseball World Cup",
        "text": "The Australia national baseball team has participated in nine of the International Baseball Federation World Cup tournaments. Australia has made it to the quarter-finals of a tournament three times—1998, 2007 and 2009— and its best result was in the most recent tournament held in 2009, in which Australia placed 5th.\nBaseball World Cup record.\n&lt;section begin=Record /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Record /&gt;\nNetherlands, 2005.\nThe 2005 tournament was hosted by the Netherlands. It consisted of a round-robin series conducted in two pools from which the top four teams in each pool qualified for the quarter-finals. Australia finished 5th in its pool, failing to qualify after finishing with a 4–4 record.\nTaiwan, 2007.\nAustralia's performance in the 2007 World Cup was their best ever. They finished 6th and outscored their opponents 61–29 while accumulating a 7–3 record over the course of the tournament, held in Taiwan. Trent Oeltjen was the tournament leader in runs scored (12), stolen bases (7) and batting average (.523), earning him a spot on the All Star team named at the end of the tournament.\nDespite the game being shortened to seven innings by the mercy rule, Australia broke the World Cup record for runs scored when they beat Thailand 26–1. The game was also significant in that two position players combined to pitch the final four innings: third baseman Gavin Fingleson threw three innings to record the win, while first baseman Brett Roneberg threw the final inning. Finishing 6th for the tournament earned Australia an automatic berth in the 2009 World Cup.\nEurope, 2009.\nIn September, Australia was one of 22 nations that sent a team to the 2009 World Cup, which was held in seven different countries across Europe. For the first round they were drawn in Pool A, held in Prague, Czech Republic, and competed against Chinese Taipei, Mexico and the hosts Czech Republic. Only a few days after selecting their 24 player squad, Australia was forced to find a replacement for Justin Huber—one of the two players selected with Major League experience—as he was called up from AAA Rochester Red Wings to MLB Minnesota Twins. James Linger was selected as his replacement, making his Australian senior team debut.\nFirst round.\nAustralia started its campaign with a win in the opening game of the tournament against their first round hosts, Czech Republic. Winning 17–4, one of the highlights was Timothy Kennelly hitting a home run and then a 3-run home run in his first two at bats. Both he and his brother Matthew Kennelly made their national team debut in the game. Following a rest day, Australia faced Chinese Taipei and won 7–5. Australia's hitting was led by Timothy Kennelly another 3-run home run in the third inning to make the score 4–0 (in addition to an outfield assist from right field to save a run in the sixth inning), and James Beresford hitting a 2-run shot in the eighth inning to break the tie and score what would turn out to be the winning runs. This win, combined with Mexico's defeat of Czech Republic assured Australia's progression through to the second round, and determining that their second round play (as well as any further play beyond the second round that they were to qualify for) would be in Italy. In their final game of the first round Australia lost to Mexico 10–9. Given that both teams had already qualified not only for the second round, but would both be playing in the same pool for the round, only momentum into the next round—and their next match in a potentially deciding final game of the pool—was on the line.\nPool A\n&lt;br&gt;\nSecond round.\nFinishing second in their first round pool, Australia qualified for the second round to play in Pool G. Apart from their hosts Italy, the other teams to qualify for Pool G were Canada, Chinese Taipei, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands Antilles and defending champions United States.\nDespite being ranked behind five of the teams in its pool on the IBAF World Rankings at the time, Australia finished the round with a 5–2. This tied with Canada and Chinese Taipei, and with the tiebreakers used in the tournament, meant Australia was second, behind only the United States. The Australians compiled a mercy rule victory over the Netherlands Antilles, victories over world No. 3 Japan, world No. 7 Mexico, world No. 8 Canada, and hosts and world No. 15 Italy, while their only defeats were by one run each at the hands of world No. 4 United States and world No. 5 Chinese Taipei.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPanama, 2011.\nAustralia is scheduled to participate in the 2011 tournament in Panama, to be held in October 2011. They will in the same pool for the first round of as Cuba, Dominican Republic, Germany, Italy, Nicaragua, South Korea, and Venezuela."

        "text": "The Peruvian climbing mouse or lesser Peruvian rhipidomys (Rhipidomys modicus), is a South American species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is endemic to the eastern slopes of the Andes in central Peru, where it is found at altitudes from . The species is nocturnal and arboreal, and lives in lower montane forest and cloud forest. It is threatened by forest clearance for agriculture and coca cultivation but is listed as a \"least-concern species\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nDescription.\nThis mouse attains a head-and-body length of between , with a relatively long tail some 135% of the head-and-body length. The fur is coarse and rather short. The general colour is yellowish- to reddish-brown agouti (with banded hairs) which contrasts with dark guard hairs. The underparts are whitish, the hairs having pale to dark grey bases, and there is sometimes an orange patch in the centre of the breast. The tail is mid to dark brown, sparsely covered with hair, and terminates in a moderately-long tuft of hair. The hindfeet are broad and their upper surfaces bear large dark patches that sometimes extend onto the digits.\nStatus.\nThis species is generally uncommon and is poorly known. Its primary habitat is virgin forest and it is not known whether it can adapt to secondary forest, although one individual was discovered in an old shed. The population trend is probably downward as the forest within its distributional range is being cleared for agricultural use and the production of illegal crops (coca), but its distribution is wide and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \"least concern\". There are a number of protected areas within its general range but it is not known whether it is present in any of these."

        "text": "The 1981–82 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland was a series of matches played by the Australia national rugby union team (nicknamed the Wallabies). The touring team played twenty-three matches between October 1981 and January 1982, winning sixteen games, drawing one and losing six. The scheduled final game, against the Barbarians, was cancelled due to heavy snow.\nThe team played four international matches but were successful in only one, against . The Wallabies subsequently lost to , and . Although they scored more tries than their opponents in each of the four internationals, the home teams' goal-kicking proved more reliable in every case.\nOutside the international programme, the Wallabies won only once in their opening four matches. They lost to the English Midlands Division in the opening match, were held to a draw by the English Northern Division in the third match and lost to Bridgend in the fourth match. They then beat Wales B (the national second-tier side) by a single point in the next game. The sixth game brought a much better performance with a 37–6 win over Pontypool. Their form improved somewhat after that and they lost only one of the remaining thirteen non-international matches, to Munster in Cork.\nThe tour experience would prove invaluable however for a number of brilliantly talented young players who in 1984 would lead the Wallabies to a Grand Slam tour victory.\nThe Ella brothers, Steve Williams, Simon Poidevin, Andrew Slack, Brendan Moon, Michael Hawker and Roger Gould all in this 1981–82 tour gave a preview of great days ahead and of Australia's eventual coming of age as a world-class rugby nation.\nThe squad's leadership.\nThe tour manager was Sir Nicholas Shehadie a 30 Test veteran and former Wallaby captain. He was at the time Chairman of the New South Wales Rugby Union and President of Australian Rugby Union. He had recently stepped down after fifteen years in local government public office including three years as the 75th Lord Mayor of Sydney. The coach was Bob Templeton.\nTour captain was Tony Shaw, the first Queenslander since Bill McLean in 1947–48 to captain Australia in the UK. Shaw would later marry McLean's daughter and made the 81–82 tour alongside Bill's son Peter and nephew Paul. Mark Loane would captain the side in the Test against England when Shaw was dropped from the team following the Scottish Test. Shaw had retaliated recklessly to niggling from Scots player Bill Cuthbertson with a king-hit right in front of the referee. Shaw was to pay dearly for this as it would mark the end of his Test captaincy career.\nThe tour.\nThe tour was dogged by appalling weather: cold, rain and snow. The Australian players brought up on firm, fast playing surfaces were shackled in ankle-deep mud. After a training mishap hooker Bruce Malouf returned home with a broken leg without having played a match. Veteran half-back John Hipwell missed many games through persistent injuries.\nSo much had been expected of the Wallaby side and following the tour many reasons were offered up to explain the disappointing result of one international won from the four played. It was said that Paul McLean's kicking was not up to his usual standard; that the scrum lacked size and power; that Tony Shaw showed his pique in felling Cuthbertson and that the loss of Hipwell was a blow. Regardless of the reasons some bad luck was evident in the cancellation of the Barbarian clash due to heavy snow caused by the 1981–82 United Kingdom cold wave and perhaps symptomatic of much ill-luck on the tour. The journalist David Lord, who travelled with the squad, wrote venomously of a Queensland-New South Wales player rift in the team which if even half-true must have affected team morale.\nTest matches.\nIreland.\nAustralia's victory was based on a magnificent defensive display. Ireland's front five won more ball than Australia but Australia's tackling and speed to the loose ball proved decisive. Paul McLean opened the scoring with an 11th-minute penalty goal and Roger Gould doubled the lead soon after with a dropped goal. McLean extended the lead to 9–0 with a further penalty before Tony Ward's penalty goal finally put Ireland on the board. Just before half-time McLean's third penalty put Australia 12–3 ahead. Ward cut the lead to 12–6 with a second penalty but O'Connor scored the only try of the game to make it 16–6 to Australia. Ward reduced their lead again with two more penalties but Australia hung on to win 16–12.\nWales.\nAustralia scored two tries to Wales's one but were beaten by a powerful performance by the Welsh pack, in which new cap Moriarty was outstanding. Goal-kicking was a significant difference between the two teams, with Paul McLean missing four of his six kicks at goal. Gwyn Evans opened the scoring with a penalty goal for Wales with Paul McLean equalising in kind soon after. Slack then scored a try after Holmes had been bundled off the ball after incorrectly calling for a mark, although McLean failed to convert. Evans scored a second penalty to make the half-time score 7–6 to Australia. In the second half, Mitchell Cox scored a try in the corner with McLean converting to make it 13–6. Wales replied almost immediately with a try from Moriarty after a 30-metre run from Rees and Evans' conversion made the score 13–12. Davies, captaining Wales for the first time, dropped a goal to put Wales ahead 15–13 before Evans' third penalty goal made the final score 18–13.\nScotland.\nDisaster struck in the Scotland Test for Wallaby captain Tony Shaw. He was questioning referee Quittenton when the Scottish lock Bill Cuthbertson kept niggling him. Shaw turned and hit Cuthbertson with a right, flooring him in front of the referee and the TV cameras. That moment marked the end of his Wallaby captaincy.\nAustralia scored three tries, all in the first half, to Scotland's one, but were beaten largely due to the fine goal-kicking of Andy Irvine, who scored a then-record 17 points for Scotland. Irvine scored three consecutive penalty goals to put Scotland 9–0 up but his charged-down kick allowed Poidevin to score an unconverted try. A second unconverted try for Moon followed, bringing the scores to 9–8, before Slack's try put Australia ahead for the first time at 12–9. McLean and Irvine traded penalties to make the score 15–12 to the Wallabies at half-time. Irvine levelled the scores at the start of the second half with his fifth penalty goal and Rutherford's dropped goal put Scotland back in the lead. Gould's failure to gather Rutherford's kick and a kindly bounce gave a try to Renwick near the posts which Irvine converted to give Scotland their 24–15 win. The game was clean apart from the Shaw-Cuthbertson incident.\nEngland.\nFor the fourth time in as many internationals, Australia scored more tries than their opponents but were beaten by superior goal-kicking. The England pack gave a powerful display with an outstanding performance by Colclough.\nRose's two early penalty goals, with one by Paul McLean in between, gave England a 6–3 lead at half-time. Moon then scored after a loose ball was hacked downfield by the backs to put Australia 7–6 ahead going into the final quarter of the match, although McLean failed to convert. When Mark Ella was caught near his own line the England forwards drove on and Jeavons scored from the maul. Dodge kicked the conversion to put England 12–7 up. Rose extended the lead to 15–7 with his third penalty goal before Moon scored his second try, near the corner. McLean missed with the kick (his fourth miss from five attempts at goal) but it was too late to affect the final result, 15–11 to England.\nThe match was also notable for the half-time appearance of the streaker, Erica Roe.\nTouring party.\nSquad.\nTour appearances include appearances as a replacement, which are shown in brackets e.g. (1R)"

Expedition style also incorporates the use of fixed ropes, and climbers (and the porters they frequently employ) will travel up and down the route several times to fix ropes and set up camps, while Alpine style eschews fixed ropes, porters, and camps, and climbers usually only climb the route once in a continuous push. Expedition style was the type of climbing Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay used in the first summitting of Mount Everest."

A number of high-profile heptathletes did not feature at the competition, including defending champion Carolina Klüft and 2007 bronze medallist Kelly Sotherton, who were both injured, and Olympic silver medallist Hyleas Fountain, who failed to qualify at the national championships.\nNataliya Dobrynska, the 2008 Olympic champion, was highly favoured to win the event, while Great Britain's Jessica Ennis was predicted to improve upon her own world leading mark of 6587 points. Tatyana Chernova, Ukrainians Hanna Melnychenko and Lyudmyla Yosypenko, and Germans Jennifer Oeser and Lilli Schwarzkopf were cited as medal contenders.\nAfter the first day, Ennis had built up a considerable lead, winning three of the four events and ending the day more than three hundred points ahead of second-ranked Dobrynska. Ennis' first day total of 4124 points was the third highest ever first day score in the heptathlon, behind Kluft and world record holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee. On the second day, unusually for a heptathlon competition, Linda Züblin set a Swiss record in the javelin throw. Ennis maintained her lead with competitive marks in the long jump and javelin throw (her weaker events) and she won the final 800 metres race, gaining her first major championship gold medal and setting a world leading mark and much improved personal best of 6731 points. Olympic champion Dobrynska faded into fourth place on the final day, while Jennifer Oeser set a personal best for the silver medal and Kamila Chudzik took bronze, Poland's first ever heptathlon medal at the competition.\nThe competition represented a breakthrough for Ennis, who had missed the 2008 Beijing Olympics through injury and whose previous best result was fourth place at the 2007 World Championships. She was Great Britain's first gold medallist of the tournament, and she became the country's third woman multi-eventer to win a major global championship, after former Olympic champions Mary Peters and Denise Lewis.\nResults.\n100 metres hurdles.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nHigh jump.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nShot put.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\n200 metres.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nLong jump.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nJavelin throw.\nKey: NR = National record, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\n800 metres.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal standings.\nKey: DNF = Did not finish, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)"

Nicola Vizzoni, Igor Sokolov, Olli-Pekka Karjalainen, Szymon Ziółkowski, Koji Murofushi, and Libor Charfreitag were all predicted to have an outside chance of a medal.\nOn the first day of competition, Kozmus was the first to pass the automatic qualifying mark of 77.50 m. Pars had the best effort of the day with 78.68 m, while former world champion Ziółkowski led group A with a throw of 77.89 m. Aspiring medallists Sokolov, Shayunov and Karjalainen all failed to progress to the final of the competition. On the final day of the hammer throw, the favourite Kozmus delivered a best of 80.15 m to take the gold medal, Slovenia's first ever in the World Championships. Ziółkowski's 79.30 m, the best of his season, was enough to take the silver – his first medal at a major championships since 2005. The level of the competition, however, failed to live up to expectations: the world-leader Pars started poorly and, after a number of fouls, he never regained ground and finished in fourth place. Furthermore, the performance of bronze medallist Zagornyi (78.09) was the shortest-ever distance of a medal winner in championship history.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 77.50 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nKey: NM = no mark (i.e. no valid result), Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place\nFinal.\nKey: NM = no mark (i.e. no valid result), SB = Seasonal best"

Chinese athlete Hao improved upon his previous best to take the silver medal while Mexican Eder Sánchez produced a season's best performance for the bronze medal. The veteran competitor Paquillo Fernández withdrew from the race before the halfway mark.\nDespite becoming the reigning World and Olympic champion, Borchin stated that he needed to achieve much more to match the achievements of his sporting heroes Jefferson Pérez and Robert Korzeniowski.\nResults.\nThe medals of some of the athletics world championship events in 2009 were re-awarded 24 March 2016 as a result of doping disqualifications.

Among the favoured athletes in the event were defending champion Bernard Lagat, European champion Mehdi Baala, and the Kenyan season leaders Asbel Kiprop, Haron Keitany and Augustine Choge.\nAll the favoured athletes progressed through a series of tactically-run heats on the first day of competition, with Baala, Kiprop, Choge and Deresse Mekonnen the four race winners. Moroccan Amine Laalou won the first semi-final, followed by Americans Lopez Lomong and Lagat, while Kiprop and Leonel Manzano both finished quickly to take the top two qualifying spots in the second race. The only high-profile athlete to be eliminated in the semi-finals was Keitany, who did not start, putting an end to any hopes of a Kenyan medal sweep.\nThe final race began slowly and, as the athletes reached the last lap, they remained in a tight pack led by Mekonnen. Choge and Mohamed Moustaoui closely followed as he approached the final straight, but the race remained open. Yusuf Saad Kamel took the lead in the final straight, scoring a surprise gold medal. Mekonnen maintained his pace to take the silver medal and defending champion Lagat had a quick burst near the finish to win the bronze. Kiprop, one of the pre-race favourites, left himself too much ground to cover, eventually ending up fourth, with Choge and Baala alongside him.\nBahrain's Kamel, born in Kenya as Gregory Konchellah, followed in the footsteps of his father Billy Konchellah, who won the 800 m at the 1987 and 1991 World Championships.

        "text": "The women's 10,000 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on 15 August. The Ethiopian team was particularly strong in the event, with two-time World Champion Tirunesh Dibaba, 5000 metres World Champion Meseret Defar, and African record holder Meselech Melkamu all vying for first place. The 2007 silver medallist Elvan Abeylegesse, Olympic bronze medallist Shalane Flanagan, and the World Cross Country Champion Florence Kiplagat were other athletes with strong medal possibilities.\nThe race featured a number of surprises and upsets, beginning with the withdrawal of the defending champion Dibaba due to a leg injury, replaced by Wude Ayalew. The race started awkwardly when the outer alley of the starting group, led by Florence Kiplagat, broke to the inside at the gun. Essentially Masai, Ayalew, Grace Momanyi and the other five runners on the outside who followed Kiplagat ran a course some 14 meters shorter than the twelve runners from the other larger alley. But confused officials did not recall the start or issue any disqualifications for the incident. Still, Inês Monteiro took the early lead with the outer runners falling in behind her. By the end of the first lap Yukari Sahaku and Yurika Nakamura had emerged as the pacesetters. After a kilometer, the Russian duo of Liliya Shobukhova and Mariya Konovalova took the lead. Konovalova held the point, marked by Nakamura at an even, leisurely pace for this crowd until just after eight laps to go when Linet Masai, who had been hanging around the back of the tight pack made a quick move to the front. All three Ethiopians rushed to mark the move. By the end of the lap, 2007 medallist Abeylegesse dropped out of the race and a quintet of runners ( Masai, Melkamu, Defar, Ayalew and Grace Momanyi) had broken away from the rest of the pack. Lap times dropped from the 75 second average to 71, to 69. But Masai's pace slowed back to 70 then 71. Momanyi came up to take the lead with the Ethiopians changing their focus though Ayalew was struggling to keep on the back behind Masai. After taking the break for a lap, Masai returned to take the lead. As the runners approached the finish line for the bell, favourites Defar and Melkamu sprinted in front. Defar held the lead through the final turn, with Melkamu boxing Masai, neither could completely break away. With clear running room coming off the turn, Masai tried to get her long legs going. She wasn't able to make much progress, nor could Melkamu pass her teammate until Defar began to fade, unable to maintain her speed. Melkamu took the lead. 14 meters out, Masai passed Melkamu. Perhaps not noticing, Melkamu prematurely celebrated but Masai was a meter ahead to take the gold medal with a tactically-timed run. Defar, completely exhausted, eventually finished in fifth as Ayalew sprinted past Momanyi to take the bronze.\nBreaking a decade of Ethiopian dominance, nineteen-year-old Masai's gold medal was the first Kenyan victory in the event since the 1997 World Championships, and the country's first 10,000 m medal since 1999.\nResults.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best"

        "text": "The Harvard-Navy lacrosse game of 1941 was an intercollegiate lacrosse game played in Annapolis, Maryland, between the Harvard University Crimson and the United States Naval Academy Midshipmen on April 4, 1941. Before the game, the Naval Academy's superintendent told Harvard that the Navy team would not play against a racially integrated team. Harvard's one black player, Lucien Alexis Jr. of New Orleans, left of his own accord after Harvard's athletic director told Harvard's coach to send him home. Harvard's players, supported by their coach, had voted to forfeit the game rather than play without him. The game went on as scheduled. Both Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations were criticized for their actions.\nGame.\nOn April 3, 1941, the Harvard lacrosse team's 18 players arrived at Annapolis, Maryland, to play the Naval Academy in a scheduled intercollegiate match. That day, the Naval Academy's superintendent, Rear Admiral Russell Willson discovered that Harvard's team included one black player, Lucien Alexis Jr. He informed Harvard's coach, Dick Snibbe, and athletic director, William J. Bingham, that Navy's squad would not play against a racially integrated team.\nAngry at the Naval Academy's stance, Snibbe and Alexis' teammates elected to forfeit the game and return to Harvard. Bingham intervened and ordered the Harvard coach to send Alexis home and play the game. Learning of Bingham's directive, Alexis voluntarily decided to depart and told his teammates that it was his idea. The game was played as scheduled the next day and Navy won 12–0.\nReaction.\nHarvard's student newspaper, \"The Harvard Crimson\", learned of the incident and sharply criticized Bingham and Harvard's administration. The newspaper said of the incident:\nIn response Bingham said: \"We were guests of the Naval Academy and had no choice in the matter. Had the game been played at Cambridge, I would have insisted that he be allowed to participate.\"\nNewspapers in Boston and New York City picked up the story and criticized Harvard's and the Naval Academy's administrations for their actions. The Harvard Council for Democracy in Education complained to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt about USNA's actions in the incident. The Harvard Corporation told Bingham and the Harvard Athletic Association to inform all future sports competitors that the school would not tolerate further racial discrimination against its student athletes.\nOne week after the incident, Alexis and the rest of Harvard's lacrosse team traveled to West Point, New York, to play a game against the United States Military Academy. In contrast to the reception the Navy had given Harvard's team, at West Point a cordon of cheering cadets, led by black cadets attending the academy, welcomed Alexis and his team.\nDoris Kearns Goodwin counts this incident among several that pressured President Roosevelt, in June 1941, to sign Executive Order 8802 that prohibited racial discrimination in the defense industry.\nLater events.\nIn 1949 Wesley A. Brown was the first black student to graduate from the Naval Academy. On May 10, 2008, a dedication ceremony was held on the Naval Academy campus for its newest building, the Wesley Brown Field House, named for him. Brown participated in the ribbon-cutting ceremony with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, Naval Academy Superintendent Vice Adm. Jeffrey L. Fowler, and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley. Also present were almost one thousand guests.\nLucien Victor Alexis (1887-1981), Harvard '17, was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the US Army and later became the principal of the only black high school in New Orleans. His son Lucien Victor Alexis Jr. graduated from Harvard in turn and went into the service in World War II. After his return, he got a degree from Harvard Business School. He later served as head of a New Orleans business college for black students, segregated by state law. He married and had children. He died in 1975. His daughter Lurita Alexis Doan became an entrepreneur, owning her own business from 1990 to 2005, and approved as the first woman and second African American to serve as Administrator of the General Services Administration (2006 to 2008), during the administration of President George W. Bush."

        "title": "Will Osborne (rugby)",
        "text": "William Thomas Osborne (11 June 1875 – 24 March 1942) was a Welsh international rugby forward who played rugby union for Mountain Ash and Glamorgan Police. Osborne played in six international matches, becoming a Triple Crown winner when he played for Wales in all three matches of the 1902 Home Nations Championship. At the height of his international career he 'Went North', switching to professional rugby league, and represented both Huddersfield and Hull F.C.\nRugby career.\nOsborne played his amateur rugby for valley club Mountain Ash. He was a collier by profession before becoming a police officer, and at 5 foot 11½ inches and weighing over 13 stone, typified the 'Rhondda forward' physique favoured by the Welsh selectors around the turn of the century.\nOsborne was first selected to play for the Welsh national team when he was selected to face England in the opening match of the 1902 Home Nations Championship. Osborne was one of seven new caps, four of whom joined Osborne in a much changed pack. Although lacking international experience many of the players winning their first caps that day went on to form the nucleus of the Wales team that beat The Original All Blacks in 1905, including Arthur Harding, Will Joseph, and fellow collier Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. In a very close encounter, Osbourne scored his one and only international try on his début; Wales then won the game through a late penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Osborne was then reselected to face Scotland in the second game of the series, played on Welsh home soil at the Cardiff Arms Park. The Scottish Rugby Union stated that they would refuse to face Wales if Osborne played, as there were rumours that he had accepted and signed a professional contract with a rugby league team. This was illegal under rugby union rules, which was a purely amateur sport. Osborne was forced to make a full statement denying the claim, and the match went ahead with Osborne in the Welsh pack. The only change to the Welsh team from the previous match was Harry Jones coming in for Llanelli's Nathaniel Walters, and the more fluent Welsh play resulted in a victory over a very gifted Scottish team. The final game of the tournament for Wales saw an unchanged team beat Ireland at Lansdowne Road to win the Championship and the Triple Crown for the third time.\nOsborne was reselected for the next season's Championship, playing in all three Wales games. After an excellent win over the English at St. Helen's in Swansea, Wales lost away to Scotland in a game played in difficult weather conditions. This would be Osborne's only international defeat as Wales beat Ireland in his sixth and final Welsh international on 14 March 1903.\nIt is unknown if Osborne would have won any further international caps as in September 1903 he signed professional terms with Huddersfield Rugby League Club, as a forward (prior to the specialist positions of; ), during the era of contested scrums. He made his début on 5 September and by October 1906 he had transferred to Hull F.C.\nWill Osborne played as a forward, i.e. number 9, in Hull FC's 7–7 draw with Leeds in the 1910 Challenge Cup Final during the 1909–10 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield, on Saturday 16 April 1910, in front of a crowd of 19,413, this was the first Challenge Cup Final to be drawn, and played as a forward, i.e. number 9, in the 12–26 defeat by Leeds in the 1910 Challenge Cup Final replay at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield, on Monday 18 April 1910, in front of a crowd of 11,608.\nLater life.\nOsborne gave up his professional playing by 1912, when he moved home to Oakengates, Shropshire, where he worked as a miner. He was also trainer at local association football club Wellington St George's. He died at his home, 53 The Nabb, Oakengates, on 24 March 1942, aged sixty-six, and was buried at the parish church of St George's.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Lund drove his number 21 to victory in three hours and 17 minutes. There were 2 cautions flags which slowed the race for 10 laps.\nWeather played a critical role in Tiny Lund winning this race; with temperatures reaching up to and wind speeds up to . Lund won by making only four pit stops, but he would not have been able to make the distance on four pit stops had the first ten laps not been run under caution to dry the track from earlier rains. Had the race not started under caution, Lund would have had to make five pit stops, just as Fred Lorenzen and Ned Jarrett did. He was able to win on four pit stops alone because of the slow start time.\nRace report.\nLund filled in for an injured Marvin Panch, who suffered injuries after a crash in a Maserati. Panch was to drive a Wood Brothers car in the 500. The win was Lund's first victory of the season.\nJim Cushman, Bubba Farr, Dick Good, Ted Hairfield, and John Rogers retired from professional stock car racing after this event. Drivers who failed to qualify for the race were: Bobby Isaac (#99), Buck Baker (#87), Pete Stewart (#57), Cale Yarborough (#52), Larry Thomas (#36), Roy Mayne (#33), Chuck Daigh (#25), Rodger Ward (#16), Al Terrell (#9) and Bill Foster (#2).\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for LeeRoy Yarbrough, H.

Only Daytona 500 starts for Troy Ruttman, Bob James, Red Foote, Len Sutton, Floyd Powell, Frank Graham, John Rogers, Dick Good, Bubba Farr, and Ted Hairfield. Last Daytona 500 starts for Nelson Stacy, Joe Weatherly, Tommy Irwin, Rex White, Ed Livingston, Jim Cushman, Herman Beam, Jim McGuirk, and Jack Smith.\nParnelli Jones, at the wheel of Bill Stroppe's factory-backed Mercury, comes home 15th in the second of his three Daytona 500 appearances. While a great finish wasn't in the cards here about three months later Jones would go on to win the Indianapolis 500. \nThe transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \"strictly stock\" vehicles of the 1950s.\nThis race marked the first time that ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" covered the race. It also helped to dispel the long-standing stereotypes of the Southern United States after the rest of the United States witnessed an emotional inspiring win."

        "text": "The 1979 Cricket World Cup (officially called the Prudential Cup '79) was the second edition of the Cricket World Cup. Organised by the International Cricket Conference, it was held in England from 9 to 23 June 1979.\nThe tournament was once again sponsored by the Prudential Assurance Company and had eight teams participating in the tournament with the only change being Canada who qualified with Sri Lanka in the qualifier for the tournament. The format remained the same with two teams qualifying from each group with the final once again being at Lord's.\nEngland joined first-time semi-finalists Pakistan as the qualifiers from Group A, while the West Indies finished top of Group B ahead of New Zealand. After the West Indies and England both won their semi-finals over Pakistan and New Zealand respectively, they met in the final at Lord's with the West Indies defending their title from four years earlier with a 92 run victory. West Indian batsman, Gordon Greenidge ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 253 runs from four matches with English player Mike Hendrick ending up as the leading wicket taker with ten wickets.\nFormat.\nThe eight teams at the tournament were split into two groups of four teams, with each team playing the others in their group in a single round-robin format. The top two teams from each group then advance to the semi-finals to play in a single-elimination tournament.\nParticipants.\nThe 1979 tournament saw the first qualifiers in a World Cup. The 1979 ICC Trophy was held during late May and early June at various grounds in the English Midlands, with the two finalists qualifying for the World Cup where they joined the six Test nations who qualified automatically. Sri Lanka and Canada qualified after defeating Denmark and Bermuda respectively in the semi-finals.\nGroup stage.\nSummary.\nThe opening round of matches took place on 9 June with four matches being played. England took on Australia at Lord's and after the home team elected to field first, restricted the Australians to 97 for one with fine fielding and bowling. After Andrew Hilditch dragged his second ball after lunch into the stumps, the Australians would be restricted for 159 which included four run-outs. The run-chase saw Mike Brearley and Graham Gooch control the innings and led England to a six wicket victory.\nKnockout stage.\nSemi-finals.\nIn a very close semi-final match, England prevailed. New Zealand won the toss and fielded. England began badly, falling to 38/2, before Mike Brearley (53 from 115 balls, 3 fours) and Graham Gooch (71 from 84 balls, 1 four, 3 sixes) resurrected the innings. Derek Randall (42 from 50 balls, 1 four, 1 six) played well in the second half of the innings, as England recovered from 98/4 to post 221 (8 wickets, 60 overs). In the response, John Wright (69 from 137 balls) attacked well in the beginning. However, the loss of wickets bogged New Zealand down, and despite several late flourishes in the batting order, New Zealand started to drop behind. When New Zealand could not achieve the remaining 14 runs from the last over of the match, England went into the final.\nGordon Greenidge (73 from 107 balls, 5 fours, 1 six) and Desmond Haynes (65 from 115 balls, 4 fours) set a first wicket partnership of 132 runs in a match dominated by batting. Vivian Richards and Clive Lloyd also contributed solidly, as West Indies ran up 293 (6 wickets, 60 overs) against Pakistan. Majid Khan (81 from 124 balls, 7 fours) and Zaheer Abbas (93 from 122 balls) shared a second-wicket partnership of 166 runs in 36 overs in the response. However, none of the other Pakistani batsmen flourished, with Javed Miandad being bowled for a duck first ball, and Pakistan lost 9/74, beginning with the dismissal of Abbas. Pakistan was bowled out for 250 in 56.2 overs in the high-scoring semi-final, sending the West Indies to the final.\nFinal.\nEngland won the toss and chose to field first. The West Indies got off to a bad start, falling to 99/4 with the loss of Greenidge, Haynes, Kallicharan, and captain Clive Lloyd. However, Vivian Richards (138 from 157 balls, 11 fours, 3 sixes) and Collis King (86 from 66 balls, 10 fours, 3 sixes) consolidated the innings. King especially ripped through the English bowling, with a strike rate of 130.3. The West Indies were already at 238/5 when the 139 run partnership ended with the loss of Collis King. Vivian Richards and the tail then took the West Indies to a very imposing total of 286 (9 wickets, 60 overs).\nThe English batsmen got off to a good start. But the openers, Mike Brearley (64 from 130 balls, 7 fours) and Geoff Boycott (57 from 105 balls, 3 fours) scored very slowly. They put together a very methodical opening partnership of 129 runs in 38 overs, playing as if the match were a five-day Test. By the time both batsmen were out, the required run rate had risen too high. Graham Gooch played some hefty strokes in scoring his 32, taking England to 183/2. However, the loss of Derek Randall triggered a batting collapse in which England lost their last eight wickets for 11 runs to finish all out for 194 in 51 overs.\nVivian Richards was declared Man of the Match.\nStatistics.\nGordon Greenidge ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 253 runs coming from his four games. Second was fellow West Indian player, Viv Richards who finished with 217 runs from four games which included the highest individual score of the tournament of 138 in the final. Graham Gooch from England rounded out the top three. Mike Hendrick from England was the leading wicket taker for the tournament with ten wickets from five matches with a three-way tie for second place with Brian McKechnie (New Zealand), Asif Iqbal (Pakistan) and Chris Old each taking nine wickets for the tournament.\nAttendance.\nThe total attendance at the tournament was 132,000, including 25,000 at the final."

It was the 33rd edition. Tacen hosted the event previously in 1955 and 1991 when it was part of Yugoslavia, and joins the following cities that have hosted the event three times: Spittal, Austria (1963, 1965, and 1977); Meran, Italy (1953, 1971, and 1983); Bourg St.-Maurice, France (1969, 1987, and 2002); and Augsburg, Germany (1957, 1985, and 2003). Women's single canoe (C1W) events became a medal event after being an exhibition in the previous championships.\nTen nations won medals at the championships, the most since the 2005 championships in Penrith. Slovakia was the big winner with five medals including three golds and two silvers. Men's canoe top medalists were Slovak Michal Martikán and France's Denis Gargaud Chanut and Fabien Lefèvre, each with two medals (one gold and one silver). Lefèvre became the first canoeist to medal in both canoe and kayak disciplines at the same championship while Jana Dukátová of Slovakia became the first woman to win gold in the C1 event and the first woman to medal in both canoe and kayak disciplines at the same championship. Dukátová won silver in the K1 women's event the day before. Italy's Daniele Molmenti won two medals in men's kayak with gold in K1 and bronze in K1 team.\nWeather conditions forced schedule changes when flow from the River Sava increased water flow fivefold, resulting in course damage that delayed competition for nearly a day on 9 September.\nEvent's corporate images.\nEvent logo.\nThe logo comprised elements connected to the sport and the event's organization. Main motif of two paddles that made up the letter X, which was the Roman numeral for 10 which is for 2010. It also is for the Roman Empire settlement of Emona, located in present-day Ljubljana, located near Tacen. The paddles in the middle of the boat are not connected deliberately to communicate both canoeing and kayaking.\nMain motif is framed by a crest which comprises two lines. The bottom line is a copy of the boat in the transverse section while the top line is a copy of the boat in the vertical section. The crest carries a sense of nobility and that the sport in the past was connected with both townspeople and aristocrats along with environmental protection. Waves shown flanking the crest link the event's organizer with the ICF.\nShort name.\nSLOKA has two names: SLalOm KAyak and Canoe Championships or SLOvene KAyak and canoe. It is acceptable in foreign languages that does not contain any special Slovene characters.\nSlogan.\nThe slogan Wild water, pure joy (Divja voda, čisti užitek is ) describes the essence of conquering the rapids refers to wild water and pleasure simultaneously. This slogan is in green and blue that combines water pleasures and ecology.\nMascot.\nThe crawfish is a symbol of clean water and life in and around that water. It is also an independent and distinctive character to enhance the story of motion and vivacity that also evokes positive motions.\nSchedule.\nThis was the schedule listed as of 15 August 2010. All times listed are CEST (UTC+2).\nK1 heats for 9 September were postponed due to the River Sava water flows exceeding / sec. K1 heats were moved to 10 September at 14:30. Two days earlier, the schedule was also revised for all individual events to flow along the river rising from a level of / sec.\nA revised schedule was issued on 10 September.

He took up the sport with Portumna Community School after his older brother Ivan had played the year before, and went on to captain the school's side in the Connacht Junior Schools Cup. Muldoon played with Nenagh at under-age level as Portumna's rugby club was defunct and not reestablished until 2002. He won an All-Ireland Under-18 Cup with Nenagh in 2000.\nClub career.\nEarly career.\nHaving won an All-Ireland Under-18 Cup with Nenagh Ormond Muldoon moved to Galway city to study, taking an Industrial Engineering course in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. He attempted to join the college rugby club, but there weren't enough members for a team. Muldoon, who was playing for the Irish under-19 side, needed to train and was invited to train with Galwegians. After impressing in the session, Muldoon was invited to join the squad by the club's Director of Rugby John Kingston.\nMuldoon played for Galwegians in the Connacht Under-20s Cup.\nConnacht.\nRookie years (2003–2008).\nMuldoon was noticed by Connacht, who gave him a summer training contract in 2001. He was still on a part-time development contract in 2003 when Connacht was nearly shut down by the IRFU as a budget-cutting measure. With the mass departure of players that followed this, Muldoon was given his first full contract for the following season.\nMuldoon first played for Connacht in the 2003–04 Celtic League season. This season also saw his former Ireland under-21 coach Michael Bradley take over as Connacht head coach, joining shortly after Muldoon signed his first contract. Muldoon had an uneasy relationship with Bradley at first, saying, \"We had an OK relationship, but not brilliant. I know when he took over I had thought 'oh no'. Later Brads told me I was hitting my ceiling and a year later that I was overachieving.\" Muldoon made his debut as a replacement in a game against Scottish side Border Reivers. He played in a total of four league games that season, with two of those appearances being starts.\nThe following season saw Muldoon became a regular figure in the Connacht team. He played 17 times for the side in the 2004–05 Celtic League, starting 11 of these games. He scored his first Connacht try on 4 September 2004 in their league match against Glasgow. During the course of the league season, he also received two yellow cards. Muldoon made his European rugby debut that season in the 2004–05 European Challenge Cup. His first game in the competition was against French side Narbonne. He played in every one of the province's games in the competition with the exception of the second game with Sale Sharks. Muldoon started each of these games and scored tries against Montpellier and Grenoble as Connacht reached the semi-finals.\nIn the following seasons, Muldoon continued to be a key member of the Connacht side. He played in 19 games for the province in the 2005–06 Celtic League and starting in all seven of the team's games in the 2005–06 Challenge Cup, while in the following season he started 19 games in the league and four of the side's six games in the Challenge Cup. In each of the two seasons, Muldoon was shown a yellow card in two league games. In the 2007–08 season, Muldoon played 17 games in the Celtic League, 15 of them starts and started four games in that season's Challenge Cup.\nCaptaincy (2008–2011).\nBradley named Muldoon as Connacht captain ahead of the 2008–09 season, replacing Andrew Farley in the role. He led the team out in a competitive game for the first time against the Ospreys on 5 September 2008, but was yellow carded in the match, as the team lost by 3–16. He played in 15 more league games that year, and was sin binned in two more games as Connacht finished bottom of the Celtic League again. Muldoon's first European game as captain came against French side Dax in the 2008–09 European Challenge Cup, and he scored a try as Connacht won by 30 points to 12 away from home. In Muldoon's first season as captain, the team made it past the group stages, but were beaten in the quarter-finals by Northampton Saints.\nIn the 2009–10 Celtic League, Muldoon played 14 games for Connacht, starting in each of them as the province finished bottom of the table for a third successive year. Connacht performed far better in Europe however, and topped their pool comfortably, winning all six games with two try bonus points. The team proceeded to the quarter-finals as the competition's top seeds. In the quarters, they faced the French Top 14 side Bourjoin, beating them 23–20 with a late Miah Nikora drop goal. Connacht advanced to the semi-finals where, on 30 April 2010, they faced a Toulon team featuring the English fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. Toulon won 19–12 in Galway, with Wilkinson kicking 14 of the French club's points. Muldoon played in and started all but one of the team's games, not playing in the home match with Olympus Madrid. He scored three tries in the competition, crossing the line against Madrid, Bourjoin and Worcester Warriors.\nIn the 2010–11 season, Muldoon's former Connacht teammate Eric Elwood took over the side. In the Challenge Cup, the team failed to qualify from their group, finishing second behind eventual champions Harlequins. Muldoon played in four of the team's six European matches. Domestically, Connacht were able to improve their league standing coming ninth from 12 teams, ahead of Glasgow Warriors and two new Italian teams. However Muldoon missed much of the season through injury, playing in only eight games in the 2010–11 Celtic League.\nHeineken Cup (2011–2014).\nFor the 2011–12 season, Connacht qualified for the Heineken Cup, Europe's premier club rugby competition, for the first ever time, and Muldoon's Galwegians club mate and fellow Ireland cap-holder, Gavin Duffy, was made team captain. The start of the season also saw the Celtic League renamed, becoming the Pro12. In the first Pro12 season, Muldoon played in every one of Connacht's 22 games, starting all but two of them. Muldoon played his first ever Heineken Cup game on 11 November 2011, against Harlequins in the Stoop. He started all six of the team's games including the bonus point defeats to Gloucester and the victory over Harlequins in the return leg in Galway, which was Connacht's first ever Heineken Cup win.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Muldoon did not play as regularly as the previous season, again due to injury. He featured in only two of Connacht's games in the 2012–13 Heineken Cup, but managed to score his first Heineken Cup try against Zebre on 13 October 2012. In the 2012–13 Pro12, Muldoon played 16 games, starting in nine of them.\nSummer 2013 saw Elwood leave his post as head coach, replaced by former international Pat Lam. Muldoon started out the year sharing the captaincy with both Duffy and Connacht's longest serving player, Michael Swift. After a poor run of form culminating in a 43–10 defeat against Edinburgh, Craig Clarke, former Super Rugby winning-captain with the Chiefs, was made Connacht's team captain with Muldoon and the others continuing to \"lead off the field\". Muldoon reached the milestone of playing over 200 times for the province in the 2013–14 season, with the landmark appearance coming on 13 September 2013 against the Cardiff Blues in the Pro12. In December 2013, he signed a new contract with Connacht to keep him at the province until 2016.\nReinstated as captain (2014–2018).\nFollowing the forced retirement of Craig Clarke due to persistent concussions at the end of the 2013–14 season, Muldoon was once again handed the captaincy in August 2014. The following season saw Muldoon start all 22 of Connacht's league games and featured in five of the team's seven games in the 2014–15 Rugby Challenge Cup. Connacht's performance in the league saw them finish an all-time high of seventh, but this was not enough to guarantee a spot in the Champions Cup, and the team was entered into a play-off with teams from England and France. Muldoon captained Connacht in their play-off against Gloucester, playing the entire game. Connacht led 18–25 in the final minutes, but a controversial penalty decision from Romain Poite gave Gloucester a try-scoring opportunity and sent the match to extra time, after which Gloucester emerged 40–32 victors.\nWith the departure of teammate Michael Swift at the end of the previous season, Muldoon came into 2015–16 season as Connacht's longest-serving and most-capped player. On 11 September 2015, he made his 250th appearance for Connacht in a 2015–16 Pro12 game against Glasgow Warriors. On 28 May 2016 Connacht, captained by Muldoon, won their first ever major trophy, the 2015–16 Pro12 after a 20–10 win against Leinster in the final. Muldoon was named man-of-the-match for his display in the game.\nMuldoon continued to be a fixture in the first team throughout the 2016–17 season, appearing in all but one of the first team matches. In January 2017, after contemplating retirement, Muldoon signed a new contract to remain at Connacht for the 2017–18 season, taking him into his 14th season with the side. On 15 April 2017, he made his 300th appearance for Connacht in a game against Leinster in the Pro12.\nPat Lam left Connacht for Bristol in summer 2017, and was replaced by Kieran Keane, who kept Muldoon on in his role as captain. In January 2018, Muldoon announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season. His final game came against Leinster in the Pro14 on 28 April 2018 at the Sportsgrounds. The result was a 47–10 win for Connacht, with Muldoon scoring his last ever points for the province by converting the team's final try of the day.\nInternational career.\nIreland.\nMuldoon has represented his country on the international stage at various levels. After playing for Portumna Community School and Nenagh Ormond as a teenager, he was selected for the Irish under-19 team. He continued to play for the Irish under-19s after moving to Galway for college and joining Galwegians. Muldoon was also selected for the Ireland under-21 side, which was then coached by Michael Bradley, his future coach at Connacht. With the under-21s, Muldoon played alongside Rory Best, who later captained the Irish senior team and Tommy Bowe, who went on to become the second-highest international try-scorer for Ireland behind Brian O'Driscoll.\nMuldoon was selected for the Ireland 'A' team at the end of the 2005–06 season. He made his debut for the second-tier side on 3 June 2006 when he started against the in a 2006 Churchill Cup pool game. He also played in the third-place play-off against England Saxons, coming on as a replacement in the last ten minutes. Muldoon was selected again for the 2007 Churchill Cup where he played against and Scotland A.\nMuldoon next played for Ireland A on 13 February 2009, playing the full 80 minutes and scoring a try against Scotland A in a friendly that took place during the 2009 Six Nations Championship. Later that season, with 13 players on the Lions tour and Leinster players unavailable after reaching the Heineken Cup final, Muldoon was named in senior Ireland squad for their 2009 tour to North America. He made his full debut for Ireland when he started against Canada on 23 May 2009, playing 71 minutes in a 25–6 victory. He also lined out against the United States the following week, playing an hour in a 27–10 victory. Later that month, Muldoon captained Ireland A in the 2009 Churchill Cup. He featured in the pool stage against Canada and the final against England Saxons, scoring a try in the latter, as Ireland won the tournament.\nIn the following season, Muldoon continued to play for Ireland A. He started against Argentina A in an end-of-year game on 27 November 2009, which ended in a 31–0 victory for the Irish. On 31 January 2010, he started for the A side, now renamed the Ireland Wolfhounds, against England Saxons in a warm-up game for the 2010 Six Nations, which ended in a 17–13 defeat. At the end of the season, Muldoon was included in the senior squad for the 2010 summer internationals. He started for Ireland in an uncapped match against the Barbarians in Thomond Park on 4 June 2010, which Ireland lost 23–29. On 12 June 2010, Muldoon started for Ireland against but was forced from the field with a broken arm 36 minutes into a 66–28 defeat. The injury meant he missed the remainder of the tour. Muldoon didn't play for the Ireland Wolfhounds again until 28 January 2012. He started at blindside flanker against the England Saxons in a 2012 Six Nations warm up game, which the Wolfhounds lost 23–17.\nBarbarians.\nIn 2017, Muldoon was called up by Robbie Deans for the international invitational team the Barbarians, ahead of their game against in Thomond Park during the November series. Also in the Barbarians team were Muldoon's Connacht teammate Quinn Roux and former Ireland teammate Donncha O'Callaghan. In addition, his former Connacht teammate Frank Murphy refereed the game. Muldoon was a 51st minute replacement for international Simone Favaro in a 27–24 victory for the Baa-Baas.\nCoaching career.\nIt was announced in April 2018 that Muldoon would be taking over the role of defence coach, at newly-promoted Premiership outfit Bristol from the 2018–19 season. The move reunited him with his former Connacht coach, Pat Lam, currently Head Coach at the club."

After five years out of the International game, Mark Vermeulen and number three Chamu Chibhabha, stabilised the innings with a second-wicket partnership of 25 from 37 balls, before Chibhabha was dismissed by Nazmul Hossain for seven.

The referee of the match was the Australian Kerry Fitzgerald and the touch judges were Jim Fleming and Brian Anderson, both from Scotland.\nNew Zealand won the match 29–9 with three tries, one conversion, four penalties and a drop goal, becoming the first winners of the Rugby World Cup.\nThis same matchup would be contested again at the 2011 final, with New Zealand again becoming the world champions.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nIn front of a capacity crowd at Eden Park, hosts New Zealand met France in the inaugural Rugby World Cup final. France seemed lacklustre following their amazing win over Australia in the semi-final. New Zealand played a mainly kicking game in the first half with Grant Fox kicking for territory and position. A Fox drop goal after 14 minutes settled home nerves. A try by the World Cup's star performer Michael Jones, followed just three minutes later. Jones' try was converted by Fox, a tense final was finely balanced at half time with New Zealand leading France 9–0.\nSecond half.\nFrance came out with renewed vigour after the break and a Didier Camberabero penalty four minutes into the half finally put France on the scoreboard. The France fightback was, however, short-lived and New Zealand forward power in the setpiece and open play was to the fore. Tries by David Kirk and John Kirwan together with the relentlessly accurate goal-kicking of Fox meant that going into the final moments New Zealand led 29–3.\nA final surge near the whistle led to a France try through Pierre Berbizier. The try was converted as the last kick of the game by Didier Camberabero.\nThe final had hardly lived up to its billing, probably due to the exertions by France in their semi-final win. It was however fitting that tries from three stars of the tournament, Jones, Kirk and Kirwan, won the contest and gave New Zealand the Webb Ellis Cup."

        "text": "The Pan American Team is one of the teams under the auspices of the USA Basketball organization. The Pan American Games are held every four years in the year before the Olympics. The first Pan American Games were held in 1951, but those games were men only. The second Pan American games in 1955 included women's teams. Eligible teams are the members of FIBA Americas. The USA has participated every year since the 1955 event, except for 1995, when the game were canceled, due to too few teams committed to play.\nParticipants in the Pan American games included the very best ever to be part of the sport–ten players ended up in the Naismith Hall of Fame, including Cheryl Miller, Nancy Lieberman and Lusia Harris. Hall of Fame members Jody Conradt, Billie Moore, Cathy Rush, C. Vivian Stringer and Kay Yow were coaches for Pan American teams, while Denise Curry and Pat Summitt participated both as players and coaches.\nHistory.\nAAU era.\nIn the early years of the Pan American (Pan Am) games, the players came from the AAU teams. The players for the 1955 team were drawn primarily from Hanes Hosiery Mills, Wayland College Flying Queens, the Dons, and Dowells Dolls. These four teams played each other in a tournament to help select the players for the Pan Am team. Hanes Hosiery came in first ahead of Wayland Baptist. This result would not be surprising, as these were the two dominant teams of the era. Hanes Hosiery won the AAU national championship in 1951, 1952, and 1953, beating Wayland two of those three years, and Wayland would go on to win the national championship the net four years 1954–1957. Not surprisingly, the twelve player Pan American team was dominated by these two teams, with six Wayland Baptist players and three from Hanes Hosiery. While Wayland provided the largest number of players, Hanes provided the captain, Lurlyne Greer Mealhouse, who would score over 18 points per game, more than twice the second highest scorer, and still the third highest scoring average in Pan American history. Greer was considered to be the best AAU player of her era.\nThe 1959 team continued to draw from AAU ranks, with even more participation from the dominant team of the era, Wayland Baptist College. The team that year was largely made up of the Wayland Baptist team, including the head coach Harley Redin, and a few stars from other teams. The USA team would go on to win all eight games and the gold medal. The AAU influence would continue through 1971, with players from teams like the Raytown Piperettes, and St. Joseph's Pepsi-Cola, along with multiple representatives from the Nashville Business College and Wayland Baptist teams. The coaches were also drawn from these ranks, with Nashville Business College's John Head as head coach in 1963, and a second stint at head coach by Harley Redin in 1971. The USA team was dominant in the beginning, winning the gold medal in their first three appearances, then settled for the silver medal in 1967 and 1971, with the latter team being led by Linda Gamble.\nCollege era.\nAlthough many of the players on earlier teams were playing at colleges, the competitions were organized by the AAU. Over time, the emphasis shifted to college organizations. The Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women started in 1967, then evolved into the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1971. With the enactment of Title IX in 1972, the growth of women's sports in general, and women's basketball in particular, grew significantly in this era. The AIAW organized national championships starting in 1972, and the USA Basketball teams increasing drew from the ranks of the AIAW members.\nIn 1975, the Pan Am team included players such as Nancy Lieberman, Lusia Harris, Pat Head, and Ann Meyers, and coach Cathy Rush, each of whom would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The gold medal winning 1975 team was especially dominant, winning all seven games convincingly. The closest game was the final against Brazil, and that game was won by the USA team 74–55.\nThe 1979 team, with Pat Head now coaching instead of playing, had high hopes to repeat as gold medal winners. Virtually the same team had won the gold at the world Championships, and the gold at the Jones Cup competition. however, the final game pitted undefeated USA against undefeated Cuba, and the Cuban team prevailed, 91–86.\nThe 1983 team returned to gold medal form, winning all five games in Caracas, Venezuela. The scoring leaders were Cheryl Miller, Lynette Woodard at 19.8 and 19.0 points per game, respectively.

The derby was held on July 12, 2010, at the site of the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. The event was broadcast live on ESPN, ESPN 3D, and ESPN Deportes. It was also broadcast internationally on Rogers SportsNet in Canada, and ESPN America in Europe. David Ortiz of the Boston Red Sox won the event.\nResults.\n\"italics\" – Hall of Famer\nRules.\nEach participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he receives 10 outs in each round. When nine outs are reached in each round, a \"gold money ball\" comes into play.\nIn the first two rounds, home run totals will carry over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a \"Swing-Off\" takes place. In a Swing-Off, each tied player gets five swings to get as many home runs as possible, plus extra swings if needed. Home runs hit during a first round Swing-Off do not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participate in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi-finals. The top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores deleted from the first two rounds.\nCharity.\nState Farm donated US$3,000 for every non-\"gold ball\" home run and $17,000 for each gold ball homer to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In addition, a child from certain a Boys and Girls Club was assigned to each of the eight players with the child assigned to the winner receiving a $50,000 donation from State Farm and the other seven getting $10,000 for their club. In all, a total of $523,000 was donated.\nMasterCard would have donated $1,000,000 to Stand Up To Cancer if a player hits one of two designated banners. The banners remained up for the All-Star Game."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1954–55",
        "text": "The 1954–55 Australians lost 3–1 to the touring England team in the 1954–55 Ashes series. The Australian teams of the 1940s and early 1950s were strong even after the retirement of Don Bradman as many of his great 1948 side remained. Australia had lost only one series since 1932–33, when they lost he Ashes to Len Hutton in the exceptionally close fought 1953 Ashes series, but had played no Test cricket since. They had thrashed John Goddard's West Indian team 4–1 in 1951–52 after his triumphant 3–1 win in England, but had surprisingly been held to a 2–2 series draw against Jack Cheetham's South Africans in 1952–53. The general opinion in Australia was that they would win the return series, especially after the great victory in the First Test. \"Although Australian batting was unsound by the old standards the presence of more all-rounders gave them the slightly better chance\" wrote E.W. Swanton \"all-rounders are said to hold the key to Test matches. Australia had four or five to England's one...\"\nThe Captain.\nWhen Lindsay Hassett retired after the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not appointed to succeed him because he was not a state captain. In 1954–55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954–55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, he was the son of the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney and (strangely) Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954–55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953–54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1–0 up in the series.\nThe Batting.\nThe weakness of the Australian team was their batting, Don Bradman (99.94), Sid Barnes (63.05) and Lindsay Hassett (46.56) had all retired and had not been adequately replaced. Arthur Morris (46.48) and Neil Harvey (48.42) were still in the team and made centuries in the 1st Test, but Morris had been dropped off Alec Bedser on 0 then failed 6 times and before being dropped himself. Harvey made a brave, undefeated 92 at Sydney against the pace of Tyson and Statham and was the only specialist batsman to play in all five Tests, but he also failed at the end. Of the other batsmen only Colin McDonald in the last two Tests was able to stand up to the England attack. Australia did have strength in depth, Keith Miller (36.97), Alan Davidson (24.59), Ron Archer (24.58), Richie Benaud (24.45) and Ray Lindwall (21.15) were all-rounders of Test class, but lacked the skills to master high class pace and only Lindwall (64 not out at Brisbane) made fifty. Captain Ian Johnson topped the Australian batting averages (116 at 58.00) by dint of batting at number ten and being not out 4 times in 6 innings.\nThe Bowling.\nThe home side were still able to call on the great bowlers of Don Bradman's Great 1948 Team; the hostile pace of Ray Lindwall (23.03) and Keith Miller (22.97), the left-arm swing and left arm spin of Bill Johnston (23.91) and the flighted off-spinners of Ian Johnson. Ray Lindwall was regarded as the finest fast bowler after the war, with a perfectly controlled action, Frank Tyson writing \"he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps – until the last couple of strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm\". Particularly dangerous was his late in-swinging yorker and \"who is not 'Lindy's bunny' when he slots his yorker in the right spot?\". Keith Miller was a batsman who had developed his bowling at the request of Don Bradman, famously mercurial he usually bowled fast seamers, but liked to mix in off-spin and leg-spin and sometimes when returning to his mark would suddenly turn and bowl off a couple of paces to see if he could catch the batsmen by surprise. \"Big Bill\" Johnston was a powerful left arm swing bowler who had been Australia's best wicket-taker three series in a row. He would do so again with 19 wickets at 22.26 and was the only Australian to take 5 wickets in a single innings (5/85 at Melbourne), but this was a testament to the strength of the Australian bowling as the wickets were usually shared around. Like Miller he could bowl spin, but instead of mixing his bowling he saved his slow left arm spinners for when the opposition were caught on a sticky wicket. The captain Ian Johnson was an off-spinner, a rarity in Australian cricket which tended to prefer leg-spinners. He was not a big spinner of the ball, and one of the slowest bowlers in cricket, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and tied down one end while the fast bowlers rested. To these veterans could be added the exceptional promise of three talented young all-rounders; the fast seam bowler Ron Archer (27.45), who topped the bowling averages (13 wickets at 16.53), the fast-medium left-arm swing bowler of Alan Davidson (20.53) and the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (27.03). Unfortunately for the Australians Davidson and Benaud had yet to mature as bowlers, Lindwall, Miller, Johnson and Davidson all carried injuries and only Benaud played in all five Tests.\nThe Fielding.\n\"Australians regard fielding as a love, not a task. Every aspiring young Australian knows he must be a fielding specialist to get into a Test team and so he goes to work accordingly.\"\nGil Langley of South Australia had taken over from the great Don Tallon as Australia's wicket-keeper, but he was injured and replaced by Len Maddocks of Victoria, who was kept due to his superior batsmanship. They were good keepers and few chances went begging when they were behind the stumps. In the field the Australians were far superior to the England side – the 1953 Australians were considered to be the best fielding team ever to tour England. – and they trained hard to improve their performance. Neil Harvey in the covers and \"the Claw\" Alan Davidson in any close catching position were outstanding, Ian Johnson was a good slip fielder and Richie Benaud an excellent gully fieldsman.\nThe Australian Team.\nBelow are the Test statistics of the Australian Test team.

        "text": "The Kent Women cricket team is the women's representative cricket team for the English county of Kent. They play their home matches at County Cricket Ground, Beckenham, as well as the St Lawrence Ground and Polo Farm, both in Canterbury. They are captained by Megan Belt and are coached by David Hathrill. They are the most successful side in both the Women's County Championship and Women's Twenty20 Cup, with 8 and 3 titles respectively. They are partnered with the regional side South East Stars. \nHistory.\n1935–1996: Early History.\nKent Women played their first recorded match in 1935, against Civil Service Women. Over the following years, Kent were one of the most prolific women's sides, playing various one-off and tourist games, against surrounding counties and national sides such as Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Kent joined the Women's Area Championship in 1980, and played in the competition until 1996 (including two title wins, in 1986 and 1987), after which they joined the Women's County Championship.\n1997–2019: Women's County Championship.\nIn 1997, their first season in the County Championship, Kent finished 5th in Division One with just one win. Over the next few seasons, Kent were a consistently mid-table side, plus one season in Division Two, in 2002. A steady improvement after their promotion, however, eventually led them to their first Championship title, in 2006. They retained their title in 2007, going unbeaten in both seasons. Key to their success was England captain Charlotte Edwards, who played for Kent from 2000 to 2016. This started an extremely successful era for Kent Women, winning the most titles in Championship history, eight, and only finishing outside the top 3 of Division 1 once, in 2017: the further times they won the Championship were in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2019. In 2016, Kent bowlers Megan Belt, Tash Farrant and Charlotte Pape were the first, third and fourth leading wicket-takers respectively, whilst Tammy Beaumont was the leading run-scorer. Kent batters Fran Wilson, Tammy Beaumont and Maxine Blythin were all in the top ten leading run-scorers in 2019.\nKent Women have also been the most successful side in the history of the Women's Twenty20 Cup, winning the tournament three times, in 2011, 2013 and 2016. They also reached the semi-finals of the competition in 2013 and 2012, losing to Berkshire both times. In 2011, however, they beat Berkshire by 8 wickets after bowling them out for just 73. In 2013, Kent beat Sussex in the final by 8 wickets, whilst in 2016 they won the title by topping Division One, with five wins from seven games. \n2020– : Regional Twenty20 Cup.\nIn 2021, they competed in the South East Group of the Twenty20 Cup, and won their region, going unbeaten with 6 wins and 2 matches abandoned due to rain. In 2022, they finished second in their group in the Twenty20 Cup, going on to lose in the final against Sussex. Kent have also competed in the Women's London Championship since its first edition in 2020, and won their first London Championship title in 2021. In the 2023 Women's Twenty20 Cup, Kent finished second in their group and reached the group final, but the title was shared due to rain.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers listed below are named as Kent squad players on the team's website.

The total number of viewers who watched any portion of the game was up 7 percent from the previous year, however, with 27.7 million total viewers.\nThe National League would not win the All-Star Game again until 2023.\nHost selection.\nKauffman Stadium underwent a US $250 million renovation, funded by a 0.375% sales tax increase on the residents of Jackson County, Missouri for the Harry S. Truman Sports Complex, which also houses Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Chiefs. The referendum passed in an election on April 4, 2006. As a result of the deal, Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig promised the area that the team would host a future All-Star Game no later than 2014. On June 16, 2010, Selig officially awarded the rights to host the game to Kansas City for the 2012 season.\nFenway Park was also in contention for hosting the 2012 All-Star Game to celebrate that park's centennial. However Boston had most recently hosted the 1999 All-Star game.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2012 All-Star Game starters began online April 20 and continued through June 28. Fan voting also took place in each MLB stadium, beginning May 8 (at the latest) and ended on June 22. The top vote-getters at each position (including the designated hitter for the American League) and the top three among outfielders, were named the starters for their respective leagues. The results were announced on July 1. A record 40.2 million votes were cast, beating out the previous record from 2011 (32.5 million) by a little under eight million. Josh Hamilton was the leading vote-getter with 11,073,744 votes, shattering the record that José Bautista set the prior year with 7,454,753 votes. Buster Posey set a new NL record for votes this year with 7,621,370 votes.\nFinal roster spot.\nAfter the rosters were revealed, a second ballot of five players per league was created for the All-Star Final Vote to determine the 34th and final player of each roster. The online balloting was conducted from Sunday afternoon, July 1, through Thursday afternoon, July 5. The winners of the All-Star Final Vote were Yu Darvish of the Texas Rangers (AL) and David Freese of the St. Louis Cardinals (NL). Chipper Jones, of the Atlanta Braves, was removed from the ballot on July 3 after he replaced Matt Kemp on the roster due to injury.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nNational League.\nThe only position player able to participate who was not used was Adam Dunn. Lance Lynn and Huston Street were the pitchers not used by the National League. For the American League, pitchers Yu Darvish, Félix Hernández (who threw 114 pitches on July 8), Jake Peavy, and Chris Perez did not enter the game.\nGame summary.\nIn the first inning, the National League scored five runs off of Justin Verlander. Melky Cabrera singled with one out, then scored on Ryan Braun's double. Two two-out walks loaded the bases before Pablo Sandoval cleared them with a triple to the right field corner. Sandoval then scored on Dan Uggla's single. In the fourth, Rafael Furcal tripled with two outs off of Matt Harrison and scored on Matt Holliday's single. Melky Cabrera's home run then capped the game's scoring. The AL had the bases loaded in the fifth off of Clayton Kershaw, but failed to drive in any runs and the NL won 8–0. It was the third straight season the AL lost in an All-Star game. With two hits and two RBI, Melky Cabrera was named the All-Star Game MVP and was the first Giants player to be named All-Star MVP since Bobby Bonds in the 1973 All-Star Game, which was also held in Kansas City.\nBox score.\nUmpires: Home Plate – Gerry Davis (crew chief); First Base – Jim Joyce; Second Base – Brian Runge; Third Base – Tony Randazzo; Left Field – Lance Barksdale; Right Field – Brian Knight &lt;br&gt;\nWeather: Temperature: , clear; Wind: 11 mph, in from left field &lt;br&gt;\nTime of Game: 2:59 &lt;br&gt;\nAttendance: 40,933"

        "text": "The 2014 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 85th edition of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held at Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the home of the Minnesota Twins. This was the third All-Star Game played in the Twin Cities; Metropolitan Stadium hosted the game in 1965, while the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome hosted the game in 1985. It was televised in the United States on Fox as part of a new eight-year deal. In preparation for the game the Twin Cities' transit company, MetroTransit, completed the new METRO Green Line light-rail between downtown Minneapolis and downtown Saint Paul, and began service on June 14, 2014.\nHost selection.\nThe Chicago Cubs were the only other team that made a bid for hosting the 2014 All-Star Game. Typically the leagues alternate hosts every year, except for 2006, 2007, 2015 and 2016, which were hosted by the Pittsburgh Pirates, San Francisco Giants, Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres, respectively. With 2014 being the American League's turn, Chicago made a bid hoping an exception would be made for the National League Cubs in order to honor the centennial of Wrigley Field (which last hosted an All-Star Game in 1990).\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting for the 2014 All-Star Game starters began online April 23 and ended on July 2.

The NL scored two runs in the second with three consecutive hits by Aramis Ramírez, Chase Utley and Jonathan Lucroy against Jon Lester. Lucroy tied the game at three in the fourth with another RBI double. The American League took a 5–3 lead in the 5th on a Trout double and a José Altuve sacrifice fly. The lead held up and the AL won by the score of 5–3. The host team's battery -- Minnesota Twins closer Glen Perkins and catcher Kurt Suzuki—took the field for the top of the ninth and Perkins earned the save."

        "title": "Australia national baseball team at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "The Australia national baseball team was the third nation, after the United States and Sweden, to participate in baseball at the Summer Olympics, making their first appearance at the 1956 Games in Melbourne, and again as part of its demonstration at the 1988 Games in Seoul.\nSince baseball was first included as a medal sport at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Australia has participated in three of the five tournaments. The best result achieved was in the 2004 Games in Athens, where Australia lost the gold medal match to Cuba to receive silver. Their medal tally puts them at 5th, equal to Chinese Taipei.\nAustralia is the only country to have hosted an Olympic baseball tournament as a medal sport, won an Olympic medal, and done so in separate years: hosted in 2000, won silver in 2004. Australia is also one of only two countries—the other being the United States—to have hosted baseball events as both a non-medal and medal sport.\nSummer Olympics record.\n&lt;section begin=record /&gt;\n&lt;section end=record /&gt;\nMelbourne, 1956.\nIn 1956, two demonstration sports were allowed: a sport from the host nation and a foreign sport—Australian rules football and baseball respectively. Rather than the tournaments that would be played at future Games while still a demonstration sport, a single match was played against a team representing the United States selected from the U.S. Far East Command, on 1 December 1956, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nThough many of the 114,000 people who attended were believed to be attending in anticipation of the athletics events to be held that afternoon, until an exhibition game played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 2008 between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox, it had the largest attendance for a baseball game ever. Even with this distinctive home-ground advantage, the Australians were unable to win, losing 11–5 in six innings.\nSeoul, 1988.\n1988 was the last time that baseball was included as an Olympic sport without medal status, and was the second time that Australia participated at the Olympic level. Though not originally included in the eight team tournament, Australia joined Canada, Chinese Taipei, Japan, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the United States after Cuba chose to boycott the Games. Australia was pooled with Canada, South Korea and the United States, but failed to qualify for the finals.\nAtlanta, 1996.\nPrior to the Games proper, Australia had to qualify to compete in the baseball tournament. After the host nation automatically qualifying, two spots were available each to European, American and Asian teams, while the final spot was available to the winner of a playoff between the Oceania Champions and the African Champions. Australia won this contest, depriving South Africa of its first opportunity to compete in Olympic baseball.\nAustralia became the tenth nation to compete for an Olympic medal in baseball, when they played Cuba in the opening game of their 1996 campaign. This game set the record for the most runs scored in an Olympic baseball match—a record that stood through to the final Olympic tournament in 2008 Beijing Games in Beijing—with the two teams combining to score 27 runs, Cuba winning 19–8. The previous record was set at the 1992 Barcelona Games, when Chinese Taipei defeated hosts Spain 20–0.\nAfter losing their first two mercy rule shortened games to Cuba and the Netherlands, Australia recorded their first victory against defending bronze-medalists Japan. Australia won only one of their remaining four games (against South Korea), which included two more mercy-rule losses to the United States and Nicaragua. They finished the preliminary stage seventh, ahead of South Korea.\nThough it has been equaled since, the loss to Cuba in the first game remains the largest defeat Australia has suffered in Olympic baseball.\nSydney, 2000.\nHaving hosted and won gold in the 1999 Intercontinental Cup ten months prior, with only one loss in the whole competition—including two victories over powerhouse Cuba—there were great expectations for Australia to perform in front of home crowds again in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Despite virtually the same line-up of teams (South Africa qualified for the Games while Chinese Taipei did not) Australia could only manage two victories during the round-robin phase against South Korea and South Africa.\nThe loss to the United States in Australia's final game of the tournament equalled the largest loss they'd suffered in Olympic competition four years previously at the hands of Cuba.\nAthens, 2004.\nQualifying.\nAs had been the case in the previous Olympics, Oceania and Africa teams first had to become champions of their respective continents before facing in a deciding series to determine the last of eight spots available. For the third successive Olympic Games, South Africa represented Africa, having won the gold medal at the 2003 All-Africa Games. Australia was scheduled to compete against Guam in the 2004 Oceania Baseball Championship, with the winner advancing to the playoff against South Africa. Three days before the best-of-five-game series was due to start, Guam withdrew from the tournament, resulting in Australia's win by default.\nAustralia hosted the best-of-five-game series against South Africa at Blacktown Olympic Park, one of two venues for the 2000 Games. Australia swept the series 3–0 to advance to the main Olympic tournament in Athens. Australian short stop Glenn Williams was named the series Most Valuable Player.\nThe Games.\nPreliminary phase.\nDespite losing the first two games against Cuba and South Korea, Australia won their next four games to secure a position in the semi-finals, including a record setting 22–2 demolition of Netherlands. No other team before or since has scored more than 20 runs in an Olympic baseball game, and only one other time has a team won by a margin of 20. (Chinese Taipei in 1992 beat Spain 20–0, and Cuba in 1996 beat Italy 20–6.) Olympic baseball operated with a mercy rule that would stop a game after seven (or eight) innings if one team was leading by ten or more runs, making it more difficult to post such large victories. Canada defeated Australia in their final round-robin game 11–0, making it the third time Australia had been beaten by a margin of 11 runs in as many tournaments.\nFinal phase.\nIn the semis, Australia faced Japan. In pool play Australia had won relatively comfortably 9–4, though it took a much more hard-fought effort to clinch their first medal: they won 1–0. This set up a rematch of the very first match of the tournament to decide the gold medal, between Australia and Cuba. As in their previous three encounters, Cuba won to take gold, leaving Australia to claim silver in their best Olympic result, and their best result to date in a major international tournament. (The IBAF includes the Baseball World Cup, World Baseball Classic and Olympic Games as major world championships, while the Intercontinental Cup is considered a minor world championship.)\nBeijing, 2008.\nThe 2008 Olympic Games baseball tournament saw the introduction of an expanded qualification phase. At prior Games, the host nation automatically qualified along with the top two teams from the Americas, Europe and Asia, and the eighth team being determined by a playoff between the best team from Oceania and from Africa. In an attempt to make the qualification a fairer representation of the top baseball nations, this was adjusted to include:\nDespite the change to the qualification structure, there were concerns raised by Australia and Canada about the timing of the tournament. As the tournament was scheduled for March, many of the players who would have otherwise been selected for the Australian, Canadian, and Mexican teams were unavailable due to commitments in the American Major League system. Though the Minor League players were eligible to play both in the qualifying tournament and the main Olympic competition, many were unavailable either due to the Major League clubs denying individuals permission, or players on the cusp of promotion to Major League teams choosing to remain in spring training camp.\nWhen New Zealand withdrew from the 2007 Oceania Baseball Championship—intended to be a five-game series between the two nations—Australia was automatically awarded the Oceania berth in the Final Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nWarm-up.\nA series of exhibition games were scheduled, both to give match practice to the players, and also to serve as selection trials for the tournament itself. Two games were played against the New South Wales Patriots—a state side—in Sydney. As some of the players in the Australian team would likely come from the Patriots, New South Wales selected its team first for the two games. Given the lack of match practice at the international level, an additional series was organised, with Australia hosting Canada in what was originally going to be a four-game series. However five games were held, two in Brisbane and three on the Gold Coast. The Patriots won their series 1–0, and Canada won theirs 3–1, with one game drawn after 9 innings in each series.\nQualifying.\nFour days after the exhibition series on home soil, Australia competed in a round-robin format against Canada, Chinese Taipei, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea and Spain. Australia failed to qualify for the Olympic Games, finishing the tournament in 5th position. Their largest defeat in the tournament proved to be the decisive game for them, despite being only their second: had Australia beaten South Korea, rather than losing to them 16–2 in a mercy rule shortened game, Australia would have finished the tournament in 3rd, South Korea in 4th and Mexico 5th. This is particularly interesting, given that South Korea went on to win gold at Beijing."

He was also the first African American to design, construct and own a professional golf course in the United States. Powell was fond of saying \"The only color that matters is the color of the greens\".\nBiography.\nPowell was the grandson of Alabama slaves and was born in Greenville, Alabama. During his youth, Powell moved with his family to Minerva, Ohio. In high school there, he played golf and football. Later, at the state's historically African-American Wilberforce University, he played on the golf team.\nAfter serving in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II in England, he returned to the Canton, Ohio-area near Minerva in 1946, and began work first as a janitor and later as a security guard for the Timken bearing and steel company. Due to racial segregation, he was banned from all-white public golf courses and was rejected for a bank loan to try to build his own. With financing from two African-American doctors and a loan from his brother, Powell bought a dairy farm in East Canton, Ohio, and with his wife, Marcella, did most of the landscaping by hand. Two years later, in 1948, he opened the integrated Clearview Golf Club. In 1978, he expanded the course to 18 holes and earned a national-historic-site designation in 2001.\nAs of the 2000s (decade), Clearview was the only course in the United States designed, constructed, owned and operated by an African American.\nPowell died in Canton, Ohio, on New Year's Eve, 2009, following complications from a stroke.\nFamily info and personal.\nPowell's daughter, Renee Powell, who is a veteran professional golfer herself, was the second black golfer to play on the LPGA Tour, after golfer and tennis star Althea Gibson. Now serving as Clearview's Head Golf Professional, Renee, who was taught to play golf at a young age by her father, is also known as one of the top golf instructors in the U.S. His son, Lawrence \"Larry\" Powell, presently serves as Clearview's Course Superintendent. His work has been recognized by both NASA and the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America.\nReferences.\nSports Illustrated January 11, 2010"

        "title": "Mixed climbing",
        "text": "Mixed climbing is a climbing discipline used on routes that do have not enough ice to be pure ice climbs, but are also not dry enough to be pure rock climbs. To ascend the route, the mixed climber uses ice climbing tools (e.g. double ice tools and crampons), but to protect the route, they use traditional (e.g. nuts) or sport (e.g. bolts) rock climbing tools. Mixed climbing can vary from routes with sections of thick layers of ice and sections of bare rock to routes that are mainly bare rock but which is “iced-up” (i.e. covered in a thin layer of ice and/or snow).\nWhile alpine climbing has used mixed climbing techniques for decades (most north-facing alpine routes are iced or snow-covered), the sport came to prominence with Jeff Lowe's ascent of the partially bolted \"Octopussy\" (WI6, M8 R) in 1994. Mixed climbing led to the sport of dry-tooling, which is mixed climbing on routes that are completely free of all ice or snow. At times, mixed climbing equipment has come under scrutiny from concerns that it was aid climbing (e.g. the lengths of tools used, and the use of heel spurs and of ice axe leashes).\nMixed climbing routes are graded for difficulty on an M-grade system, and the development of specialized mixed climbing techniques (e.g. stein pulls and figure-four moves), and equipment (e.g. fruit boots, heel spurs, and advanced ergo ice axes), led to dramatic increases in mixed climbing grade milestones, particularly from 1994 to 2003, and have been credited with pushing standards in the wider field of alpine climbing. Many modern mixed routes are bolted like sport climbing routes, but some routes require traditional climbing-type protection.\nDescription.\nMixed climbing involves using ice climbing equipment (e.g. double ice axes and crampons) on routes that are not sufficiently covered in ice to be pure ice climbs and have a WI-grade. Mixed climbing routes have significant elements that are pure rock, which in some cases may be completely dry (e.g. as found on some North American mixed climbing routes), but in many cases is covered in a thin layer of ice and snow (e.g. as found in Scottish mixed climbing), thus making pure rock or ice climbing techniques impossible.\nThe mixed climber uses their ice axe and crampons to advance up the route by inserting them into small cracks and edges on the iced-up rock. They use the equipment of a traditional climbing rock climber for climbing protection, as there will be limited possibilities to use ice screws to protect the route. It has also become common to find single-pitch mixed climbs that are fully bolted in the manner of sport climbing routes. Mixed climbing can also be done as free solo climbing, which is an even risker undertaking.\nMixed climbing is closely related to alpine climbing, as many alpine climbing routes have large sections of iced and snow-covered rock that can neither be rock climbed (i.e. too slippery) nor climbed as a pure ice climb (i.e. not enough ice). Mixed climbing is also closely related to the sport of dry-tooling, which was developed by mixed climbers doing routes with no snow or ice, but still using the tools and techniques of mixed climbing; mixed climbs that have no ice are sometimes given a \"D\" prefix instead of an \"M\" prefix in their grade.\nThere has been debate as to whether mixed climbing is akin to aid climbing (i.e. use of mechanical tools on rock), which has led to increased oversight on allowable tools (e.g. use of heel spurs, length of axes, and use of leashes for resting, etc.); and most ice climbing competitions no longer allow leashes and regulate the use of heel spurs (e.g. if allowed at all, they cannot be used for resting).\nTypes of routes.\nMixed climbing routes can cover a broad range of types. Some mixed climbing routes are combinations of full ice climbing routes (i.e. a large frozen icicle, frozen alpine couloirs, or frozen water cascade) and full dry-tooling routes (i.e. a rock overhang, gully, or roof to get to or from the frozen ice part); these routes have both a full mixed climbing grade (M-grade) and a full ice climbing grade (WI-grade). Examples are the American route, \"Octopussy\" (WI6, M8), \"Silent Memories\" (WI6, M9) in Italy, or \"French Reality\" (M7-, WI6+) in Canada.\nOther types of mixed climbing routes have no material ice climbing sections (and thus have no substantive WI-grade), and are really rock routes but where the rock is covered in a layer of ice and snow that makes normal rock climbing impossible. Examples include many Scottish winter climbs, such as \"Wailing Wall\" (Scottish mixed climbing grade XI, 9) or \"Banana Wall\" (Scottish mixed climbing grade XII, 12), or \"North West Passage\" (M11) in Montana.\nHistory.\nWhile alpine climbers and Scottish winter climbers have used mixed climbing techniques for decades, mixed climbing as a standalone sport came to prominence in 1994 when American climber Jeff Lowe climbed the roof of \"Octopussy\" (WI6, M8) in Vail, Colorado, creating the world's first M8-graded mixed climb. In 2014, \"Rock &amp; Ice\" credited Lowe's 1994 ascent with effectively inventing the \"sport\" of mixed climbing.\nLowe's ascent led to an increase in interest in mixed climbing, and from 1994 to 2003 levels of difficulty rose sharply from M8 to M13, driven by mixed-climbing pioneers such as Stevie Haston in Europe (particularly in Val di Cogne), and Will Gadd in North America (particularly in the Fang Amphitheater in Vail, and in the Cineplex Cave in Alberta). In 2003, Italian climber finding he was too short for the crux on \"The Game\" (M13) in Cineplex Cave, lengthened his tools and completed it. This led to implications that mixed-climbing was akin to aid climbing. A similar debate had been boiling over on heel spurs, which Gadd had decided to stop using (calling it \"barebacking\"), and writing a manifesto titled \"Spurs are for Horses, and Tools Are For Your Hands\", which stated \"A route climbed by sitting on your tool, hooking a tool with your knees or spurs or even using spurs is an aid climb\".\nCompetition ice climbing also began to regulate the use of tools, including heel spurs, tool length, and tool leashes (which can be used for resting). In 2012, mixed-climber Ryan Nelson wrote an article in \"Rock &amp; Ice\" titled \"Is mixed climbing still legitimate?\". Scottish mixed-climber Dave MacLeod told Nelson, \"Modern-mixed is definitely approaching stagnation\", and \"Ditching heel spurs will no doubt give it another gasp of life, but it only puts it off a year or two. The reason is, of course, that [climbing] a full ropelength of horizontal roof on tiny hooks is relatively easy\".\nWhile the evolution of grade milestones in mixed climbing has tapered since 2003, leading mixed climbers such as Raphel Slawinski have highlighted the positive effect of mixed climbing on overall standards in alpine climbing. Other alpine climbers such as Steve House have cautioned that the reliance on fully bolted sport climbing routes for the highest M-grades, has not yet led to a discernable impact on general standards in alpine climbing.\nTechniques.\nAs well as using standard techniques of ice climbing (e.g. front pointing) and of rock climbing (e.g. crack climbing, but with ice axes), mixed climbers have developed a range of techniques that are largely unique to their sport (and the derived sport of dry-tooling). These include:\nIn addition, mixed climbers try to keep their elbows near their sides (i.e. to avoid draining energy in torque and stein pulls), and are very careful in extracting wedged blades (i.e. which can ricochet back into the climber's face), and of gently balancing the front points of their crampons on thin holds.\nEquipment.\nMixed climbing started by using existing ice climbing equipment for upward momentum (e.g. double ice axes and crampons), and existing traditional rock climbing equipment (e.g. nuts, hexcentrics and cams) or sport climbing equipment (e.g. bolts and quickdraws) for climber protection.\nAs the sport of developed, specialized equipment was created including:\nGrading.\nM-grades.\nThe grading of mixed routes approximates the ice climbing WI-system up to grade M6, but they then diverge as mixed routes become very overhanging and eventually turn into roofs (ice is not normally overhanging). M-grades do not take into account the \"danger\" of the route (i.e. how good is the protection in the event of a fall), but focus on the technical and physical challenge of the route, and is thus more akin to the French and US sport climbing grades, although as with the US system, the \"R/X\" suffix is used for danger.\nSome M-graded climbs are given an alternative D-grade prefix where there is no ice on the route, and it is effectively dry-tooling (e.g. the Swiss climb \"Iron Man\" is quoted as being M14+ but also D14+).\nThe following M-grades and descriptions are provided by the American Alpine Club (republished in 2013) who note: \"These [mixed climbing] routes require considerable dry tooling (modern ice tools used on bare rock) and are climbed in crampons; actual ice is optional but some ice is usually involved\":\nIn his 1996 book, \"Ice World\", Jeff Lowe ranked his new M-grades to the level of physical exertion needed on a free rock climb; Lowe estimated that M8 was equivalent to 5.12 (American YDS). Other authors have tried to align M-grades with rock climbing grades, and now equate M8 to 5.10/5.11, however, there is some variation and no consensus that such comparisons are valid.\nScottish winter grades.\nMixed climbing in Scotland is known as Scottish winter climbing and uses a dual-grading system with a Roman numeral to denote the overall difficulty of the route (e.g. technical challenge, length, and the level of boldness, physicality, and stamina required). A second Arabic number clarifies the technical difficulty of the hardest move on the route. A climb graded VI, 6 means the technical difficulty of the hardest move is standard for the overall grade, whereas a climb graded VI, 8 denotes the hardest move is above the overall grade.\nThis dual-grade is used as Scottish winter climbs use traditional climbing protection, placing greater strains on the climber. British mixed-climber Ian Parnell wrote in his guide to Scottish winter climbing that Scottish grades are almost two levels above M-grades, and thus a Scottish VIII, 8 is similar to an M6; but that an onsight of a Scottish VIII, 8 using traditional climbing protection, is similar in difficulty to a bolted sport climbing M8.\nThe American Alpine Club (republished in 2013) listed the following description of Scottish winter grades:\nEvolution of grade milestones.\nThe following mixed climbs are particularly notable in the evolution of mixed climbing grade milestones and mixed climbing standards.\nFemale grade milestones.\nMany leading female mixed climbers are competition ice climbers from the UIAA Ice Climbing World Cup tour, however, despite their smaller grouping, on occasions, female mixed climbers have set grade milestones that closely matched the highest male grades at the time:\nFree solo.\nA number of mixed climbers have set new grade milestones in a free solo climbing style (i.e. no protection such as ice screws or bolts):"

        "title": "Old Leightonians Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Old Leightonians Cricket Club is a cricket club for former pupils of Leighton Park School, Reading, Berkshire. As of 2020, the club has 197 members, as well as eleven honorary members. The club does not compete in league cricket and thus most of its fixtures are friendly matches against a variety of opponents – from teams in the Reading area (including Leighton Park School's 1st XI) through to sides in the club's current touring destinations: the East Midlands, Devon, Kent and Nantes, France. Home games are played at Leighton Park School.\nClub history.\nPre-1977.\nOld Leightonians cricket dates back to 1899, when a team of former pupils from Leighton Park School took on the school's 1st XI for the first time. Since then the fixture has been contested annually, with a few exceptions, and for many years it represented the only chance for former pupils to play under the Old Leightonians banner – although a number of other matches, including some in the Netherlands, were played by Old Leightonians sides in the 1920s and 1930s. It was not until 1976, at a game between the OLs and NatWest Bank, that the idea of staging regular Old Leightonians fixtures against other teams each season (in addition to the annual fixture against the school) was first put forward, and this led to the formation of the club in 1977.\nThe inaugural season.\nThe Old Leightonians Cricket Club was founded by Graham Carter and Martin Wigram on Sunday 27 February 1977 at the Jolly Farmer pub in Puttenham, Surrey, with Carter taking the jobs of Club Secretary and Statistician while Wigram assumed the role of Fixture Secretary. A list of eight fixtures was drawn up for the 1977 season, beginning with the annual fixture against the Leighton Park School 1st XI. Held on 21 May, a side made up of Leighton Park alumni from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was assembled to take part in the club's inaugural match. Dominic Beer faced the first ball and Andrew Moss top-scored with 51 not out as the OLCC declared on 177–8. In reply, the school 1st XI were well set on 106–1 before the OL captain, Derek Brewer, swung the match decisively in the old boys' favour with a devastating spell of 14–8–18–7, which remained the best figures for over 30 years. Brewer finished the match with a hat-trick as the school 1st XI were bowled out for 128, giving the OLCC a 49-run victory. Later that season the club embarked on its first tour, playing three games in Suffolk at the start of July.\nThe early years.\nThroughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, the club steadily grew in membership and expanded its fixture list. In 1978 the club entered the Brewers Company Cup, a limited-overs cup competition for former pupils of smaller independent schools, a move that added some more competitive cricket to the club's calendar. This usually came in the form of just one match each season since the OLCC did not enjoy any great success in the cup, a fact underlined in 1981 when the club suffered its heaviest ever defeat, losing to Denstone Wanderers by 253 runs. Though the annual tour to Suffolk only lasted until 1979, a replacement touring venue was found in the West Country in 1982, beginning a run of annual tours to the area that would not end until 2007.\nBy 1986, the club's membership had risen to 75 and to mark the successful completion of ten seasons, a special dinner was held at which the guest speaker was the Test Match Special scorer Bill Frindall. Meanwhile, the club's status as a hotbed of cricketing joviality was beginning to be defined. The club's first tour to the West Country had seen the inauguration of the 'Tour Joker' – an award given to the member of the touring party who was deemed by the tour managers to have caused the most amusement to his fellow tourists – and by 1986 this prize had become a much cherished and sought after club institution.\nThe members turn to Beer.\nAfter ten years as club secretary, Graham Carter made way for Dominic Beer as the OLCC entered a new era that began with an exciting new venture: the club's first overseas tour, which came in the form of a weekend in Paris at the start of the 1987 season. Alongside the annual West Country tour, Beer's tenure as secretary would see the club return to Suffolk and add the East Midlands to its list of touring destinations. On the field, the early and mid-1980s had provided the OLCC with a new generation of club stalwarts who ensured the club continued to thrive. Success in the Brewers Cup remained elusive, however, as the club failed to advance beyond the first round for six years in a row.\nHaving stepped aside as club secretary, Carter became the club's president in 1988 and continued to oversee its progress. To mark his 50th birthday, a special game was held at Leighton Park in 1996 that was to see records tumble. In a day's play that began at 11:00 am and finished just a few minutes before 9:00 pm (partly due to a two-and-a-half-hour lunch break), 635 runs were scored, 167 of which were contributed by Andrew Moss in a club record innings that allowed the OLCC to record a thrilling four-wicket victory against the President's invitation XI.\nSamuels takes charge.\nDominic Beer was succeeded as club secretary by Phil Samuels at the start of 1997, and although his tenure began with an inauspicious return on the field that season (the club managed only one win, and that came in its first match of the year), the change reflected the shift in playing membership as a wave of school leavers from the mid-1990s – known to the senior members as 'jolly juniors' – began what would become long and fruitful careers in the OLCC. As well as contributing on the field, the younger generation were also brought in as office-holders as well as carrying out the duties of match and tour managers.\nThe culture of touring soon found itself in the rudest of health, as the now annual trips to the East Midlands and the West Country were supplemented in alternate years with a long weekend in Saumur, France. Even though three tours were in the club's schedule every other year, appetite for touring remained strong and the 1999 edition of the West Country tour took with it 24 members.\nEven in the Brewers Cup, the customary first-round exit was no longer a certainty as the club engaged in a series of astonishing battles. The highest scoring of these came in 2001 when the club's highest ever total – 337 all out – was unfortunately 40 short of the Old Bloxhamists' gargantuan effort, and the OLs were unlucky to be defeated twice on the now discredited run rate system, in 2000 and 2004. Then, in 2005, the OLCC was defeated by the old boys of Taunton School, only to then discover after the match that the opposition's No 3 batsman, who made 171 from just 113 balls, had not even attended said institution. Taunton were duly kicked out of the tournament allowing the OLs to progress.\nBut the most amazing of these Brewers Cup encounters came at St Edmund's, Ware, in 2002. Chasing 252 to win, another first-round cup exit for the Old Leightonians looked likely at 94–7, and a racing certainty at 163–9. But No 9 batsman Michael Thomas, who had only been drafted into the side at the last minute, smashed a quite remarkable unbeaten 102 from 70 balls, and with No 11 Julian Shackel swatting a composed 27 not out, the OLs pulled off a one-wicket win in the penultimate over.\nAll change.\nAll was not well in the Brewers Cup competition, however. The Taunton incident in 2005 merely served to heighten the issue of 'ringers' playing for some of the competing clubs and the following year proved the final straw for the cup committee as a series of withdrawals – that allowed the OLCC to reach the semi-finals without even playing a game – contributed to their decision to close the competition. (The OLCC had raised a full team of bona fide Old Leightonians for every fixture they had contested in the competition since joining in 1978, making the decision to wind up the competition all the more difficult for the committee's chairman, Robert Stein, himself a stalwart member and subsequently a Life Vice President of the OLCC).\nAn unsuccessful experiment with a replacement competition ended in farcical circumstances in 2007, which gave rise to the club founding its own cup competition. Thus the Old Leightonians Challenge Trophy was inaugurated in 2008 and has since been contested by the Old Leightonians, the Leighton Park School 1st XI and the 'Parktimers' – a team comprising Leighton Park staff and guests – in a 20-over format. The Parktimers won the first two editions.\nElsewhere, there were other major changes in the life of the OLCC. After 26 consecutive seasons in the West Country, the club members chose to relocate its main tour, which by now had become a week-long trip at the end of August, to the north Norfolk coast. New fixtures and a new touring base were found and these proved to be an excellent addition to the calendar.\nNorfolk and the new age.\nTaking up residence for one week a year, the OLs first attended the Links Hotel, West Runton in 2008. With a great set of fixtures and local attractions, the Old Leightonians quickly settled into their new annual tour; venue highlights to include a game at Sandringham and an evening on Cromer pier. And there were plenty more highlights to be found back at the hotel, most notably the tale of 'Dangerous' of his infamous night on tour.\nMuch as it had done in mid- to late 1990s, the club received another injection of youth from 2008 to 2009 leavers. These leavers were to form the spine of the side for the next few years, and within their number were two club record breakers with both bat and ball. Whilst on Norfolk tour against Tom Johnson's XI in 2010, Shashank Narayanasamy recorded a new OLCC best 8-36, including a hat-trick. Not to be outshined, James Barratt broke the previous club record by blasting 170* not out in 2012 at Leighton Park.\nThere was a shake-up of the clubs roles, with James Barratt taking the reins as club secretary, Nick Hayles assuming the roles of club treasurer and availability secretary and Seb Powers becoming the new club statistician.\nIn the OLCT competition, Pete Bulteel led his Parktimer 'Staff' XI to seven consecutive trophies in as many years. It took a special invitational XI led by longtime Head of Sports Mark Simmons in 2015 to finally end this run. Simmons led a Field House XI to victory in their only two games to date and a new name was engraved for the first time in the competition's history. Finally in 2016, in the competition's 9th year, Seb Powers was able to finally lead the OLCC to their maiden victory in the competition with a 2–0 series win over the Parktimers XI.\nBy the middle of the 2016 season, the Old Leightonians had welcomed nearly 190 ex-pupils back to represent the club and had lengthened their Honorary membership to 10 members in total!\nDevon, Kent and the retirement of a legend.\nIn 2016, after eight very enjoyable tours of Norfolk, the OLCC took their touring party back to Devon for an extended weekend of cricket and joviality. In addition to this annual tour, a two-day tour of Kent was successfully scheduled and enjoyed by all in 2018. The Kent Tour would occur every two years, alternating with a revived tour of France and the new location of Nantes, starting in 2019.\nCoinciding with the retirement from England Cricket of one Sir Alistair Cook, another cricketing colossus decided to hang up their boots in 2018. Andrew 'Mickey' Moss called time on a 41-year OLCC legacy that will always see him regarded as one of the greatest Old Leightonian Cricketers. With nearly 8,500 runs over 358 appearances, Andrew will be sorely missed from the batting lineups of future Match Managers. Early rumours suggested he was taking up a cricket lecturing director role for the OLCC from 2019.\nPlayers.\nCurrent players.\nThe following table lists OLCC members and honorary members who played at least three games for the club in recent seasons.\nThe number in the first column refers to that player's unique club number, which is allocated in order of debut date for the club. \"Note: In the event of more than one player making their first appearance in the same game, the player listed higher in the batting order takes the first available number.\"\nCaptains.\nThe OLCC does not have club captains as such, but a captain has been elected to lead the side in the various cup competitions in which the club has taken part every year since 1978.\n\"BC – Brewers Cup; CWT – Cricket World Trophy; OLCT – Old Leightonians Challenge Trophy\"\nClub records.\nThe OLCC keeps what is thought to be one of the most comprehensive sets of statistics in club cricket, issuing an annual update of 99+ pages that details a range of records, from every score of 50 or more through to a list of counties (and countries) in which the club has played."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1958–59",
        "text": "The 1958-59 Australians defeated the touring England team 4-0 in the 1958–59 Ashes series. They were seen by the English press as having little chance of winning the series against the powerful England touring team. They had only one recognised great player, Neil Harvey and had lost the fast bowling combination of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and the other veterans of Don Bradman's Invincible 1948 team. There were, however, signs of recovery to those who would see them and E.W. Swanton believed that on their home ground Australia would be a shade better than England. The best indication of the forthcoming series was the M.C.C. and Australian tours of South Africa in 1956-57 and 1957-58. South Africa had a strong team in the 1950s, stunning the cricketing world by drawing 2-2 in Australia in 1953-54, losing 3-2 in the closely fought 1955 series in England and fighting back from a 2-0 deficit to draw 2-2 with Peter May's England in 1956-57. In 1957-58 Ian Craig led a team labelled as the weakest to leave Australia to a 3-0 victory over the Springboks with Richie Benaud, Alan Davidson, Wally Grout, Ken Mackay, Colin McDonald, Jim Burke and Lindsay Kline all in fine form. Norm O'Neill was not taken on tour, but struck innings of 175 in three hours and 233 in four hours in successive games against Victoria and was regarded as the \"New Bradman\".\nThe Captain.\n\"Richie's great ability as a captain is best gauged by the fact that he took an ordinary Australian team and shaped it into a winning side...he got some outstanding results with teams under him that would not bear comparison with the finest in Australian cricket history. It was his positive, attack-minded leadership that made all the difference.\"\nRichie Benaud was a leg-spin bowler who had taken 49 Test wickets (34.41) when he left England in 1956, but grabbed 23 wickets (16.83) India, including his first three 5 wicket innings and his best Test bowling figures of 7/72. His cricket improved in South Africa in 1957–58 where he took 30 wickets (21.93) and another four 5 wicket hauls and made 329 runs (54.83) with two centuries. His attacking cricket impressed Sir Donald Bradman and the Australian selectors and he was the surprise choice as captain when Ian Craig retired due to ill-health. Neil Harvey was vice captain and Australia's best batsman and the \"red-hot favourite for the captaincy\", but had lost to Peter May by a crushing 345 runs when he led an Australian XI against the tourists and this must have affected their decision. Benaud had been picked as vice-captain to Arthur Morris for the Second Test against England in 1954-55, but Morris sought advice from more senior players and Ian Johnson returned for the next Test. In 1958 Benaud was made captain of New South Wales, but had yet to lead them in a Sheffield Shield match when he was made the national captain, but accepted the challenge with energy. A great believer of the saying \"practice makes perfect\" he trained himself and the team and honed their athletic advantage over the visitors. In particular he heightened their already formidable fielding skills, which he used to dry up the runs of the England batsmen, and their catching became phenomenal. He also encouraged quick running between the wickets to steal runs and unsettle the England bowlers. In the field his tactical genius proved decisive with cunning bowling changes and inventive fields, though he was happy to take advice from the more experienced Harvey and other players. His reputation reached such heights that a simple field change would torment batsmen who tried to work out what he was doing. In the Fourth Test \"he moved short leg round a couple of yards...there was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsmen\" Always aggressive and willing to take risks he proved to be one of the greatest captains in cricket and won his first five Tests series as captain, the sixth he drew to retain The Ashes. As a player, he grew into the role, becoming the first cricketer to make 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests and his 248 wickets was an Australian record until beaten by Dennis Lillee. When he retired he became a famous broadcaster and journalist and would sometimes jokingly depreciate his captaincy, saying that \"the hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss at the right time\", but in 1958-59 he lost the toss in the first four Tests and still won three the regain The Ashes.\nThe Batsmen.\nColin McDonald was captain of Victoria and an effective opener with a short backlift who had made centuries against South Africa and the West Indies and had stood up to Tyson in 1954-55. He made as fighting 32 and 89 in \"Laker's Test\", but failed in the rest of the 1956 series. In 1958-59 McDonald's 519 runs (64.87) made him the first batsmen to top 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950-51 and the first Australian to do so since Don Bradman in 1948. His opening partner was Jim Burke a stonewaller who took 578 minutes to make 189 against South Africa in 1957-58 Cape Town and was the butt of the Sydney Hill barrackers; \"Burkey, you're so like a statue, I wish I were a pigeon\" He didn't make many runs in 1958-59 though he tended to hang around and retired at the end of the season rather than face the increasingly number of fast bowlers. Neil Harvey was Australia's premier batsmen after the retirement of Don Bradman, a left-handed strokemaker whose technique allowed him to make runs while other could hardly get bat to ball. Norm O'Neill made his debut in this series and was like a breath of fresh air in the stagnant cricket of the late 1950s. Athletic, good-looking and a positive strokemaker he was hailed as the \"New Bradman\" and a favourite with the crowds. Crowds flocked to his games just to see the \"Australian Hope\" and his striking 71 not out to win the First Test made a mockery of the England's funeral second innings. After Harvey and O'Neill came Ken Mackay sarcastically called \"Slasher Mackay\" as he rarely indulged in strokeplay, instead the ungainly Queenslander set about occupying the crease for as long a possible. He never made a Test century and only averaged 33.48, but always seemed to make runs when Australia was in trouble. Les Favell had a terrible time as an opener against Tyson and Statham in 1954-55, but was now a powerful middle-order batsman and crowd favourate who replaced Peter Burge after the First Test. Worth a mention is Bobby Simpson, a batting prodigy to match Norm O'Neill and an outstanding slip fielder, who made a duck in his only Test innings in the series, but was often 12th man and used as a substitute fielder. In the lower order were Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson, both hard-hitting all-rounders who liked to attack the bowling, but whose late order heroics were seldom needed.\nThe Bowlers.\nWith the retirement of Keith Miller, Bill Johnston, Ken Archer and Ian Johnson in 1956 Australia needed to rebuild their bowling attack. Ray Lindwall would continue to play until 1960, and would overtake Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record of 216 wickets. However, he was now 37 and was no longer the fast-bowler who had terrorised the England team in the 1940s even though he swung the ball heavily. Considering the bent elbows of Australia's latest talent and the purists dubbed him \"the last of Australia's straight-arm bowlers\". Fortunately the all-rounders Alan Davidson and Richie Benaud came good in the 1957-58 South African tour after years of underperforming. \"Davo\" was a left-handed fast-medium swing bowler who came round the wicket and could move the ball either way off the pitch or through the air. Dogged by perennial injuries he took only 16 wickets (34.06) between 1953 and 1957, but starting in 1957-58 he would take 23 wickets or more in six out of seven series. Tom Graveney thought he was \"possibly the greatest left-arm new-ball bowler in the history of cricket\" and with the exceptionally low Test average of 20.53 it is difficult to argue with him. The captain Richie Benaud had in the last year emerged as probably the finest leg spinner in the world and his 31 wickets (18.83) in the series was the most taken for Australia against England since Monty Noble in 1901-02. No great spinner of the ball, he was able to produce subtle variations, and unlike most leg-spinners was very economical. After these three greats Australia's bowling was less dependable, or acceptable. Ian Meckiff took 17 wickets (17.17) with his fast left hand swing bowling, but was never able to overcome the accusations of throwing that beset his career. His unusual style gave him the ability to swing the ball at high speed and the flick of his hand made it difficult for the batsman to read the ball. Meckiff was definitely fast, saying he \"likes to make them whistle\", but erratic, sometimes bowling balls two feet off the stumps on either side of the wicket. When Meckiff was ill the 6'5\" Giant Rorke came in and proved to be just as dangerous, taking 3/23 in the first innings of the Fourth Test and was sometimes almost unplayable as many balls pitched wide of the crease.\nThe Fielding.\n\"Richie Benaud has a fine team; he inspired them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen.\"\nWith their baseball experience Australia were traditionally a stronger fielding side than England, but had been outclassed in 1956. Richie Benaud saw this as an area in which they could dominate and set about improving their already athletic skills to an extraordinary level. In this he was helped by having outstanding fielders in wicket-keeper Wally Grout, Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill in the covers, Bobby Simpson and Jim Burke in the slips, \"The Claw\" Alan Davidson in any close catching position and Benaud himself in the gully. Their efforts make the English fielders look pedestrian, dried up the runs and restricted strokeplay and the spectacular England collapses can be attributed to their ability to turn half-chances were into catches. Wally Grout had played second string to Don Tallon at Queensland since the war and Gil Langley and Len Maddocks for Australia since Tallon's retirement in 1953. As a result, he was 30 when he played in his first Test on the 1957-58 South African tour, when he held a record 6 catches in an innings. He soon established himself as the best wicket-keeper in the world and when he retired in 1966 his 187 dismissals in 51 Tests was second only to Godfrey Evans's 219 in 91 Tests.\nTest statistics.\nBelow are the Test statistics of the Australian squad. \nFirst Test - Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nThird Test - Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test - Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1958-59 Ashes series\""

        "title": "Umpiring in the 1958–59 Ashes series",
        "text": "The England team were very unhappy with the umpiring of the 1958–59 Ashes series, in particular the questionable actions of some bowlers in the Australian team. The televising of Test cricket was in its infancy and the notion of Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques was considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as part and parcel of the game. However, touring teams sometimes felt that there was a natural bias towards the home team which led to some acrimony. Keith Miller thought \"Mel McInnes, Colin Hoy and Ron Wright were our leading umpires in the 1954-55 M.C.C. tour of Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that McInnes gave the finest exhibition of umpiring in a Test series that I have experienced\". The England team thought well of him too, but in 1958-59 he lost the confidence of the England players and himself, appeared hesitant and gave some surprising decisions. In the Fourth Test he hesitated to give Ken Mackay out even after the batsman walked after snicking a catch off Brian Statham. Later Colin McDonald should have been run out when Fred Trueman flattened the stumps after his runner Jim Burke ran round the back of McInnes. McInnes gave him out, but then changed his mind and gave him not out as he had not seen whether Burke had made the run or not. On his next ball McDonald sportingly pulled his bat out of the way of the stumps to give Trueman \"the easiest Test wicket I have ever taken\". Trueman was affected again when he batted, given out caught by Wally Grout off Richie Benaud when he had dropped his bat and missed the ball. The England team became dispirited by the umpiring mistakes and, believing the officials to be against them, lost heart. As Fred Trueman wrote\n\"...the Australian umpires demonstrated as much impartiality as a religious zealot. We just couldn't get favourable decisions and they no-balled England bowlers left, right and centre...one of the umpires consistently no-balled me...It was annoying, especially as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!...I suffered, as did others, from appalling umpiring decisions when batting...It was unbelievable.\"\" \nThrowing.\n\"There was much comment in the Press box as to the legitimacy of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated a considerable amount of pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.\"\nIn cricket to throw the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no-ball, but until 1960 it was undefined and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence. To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a \"chucker\" could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright straight arm was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said \"It is the most complex question I have known in cricket, because it is not a matter of fact, but a matter of opinion and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views\".\nDragging.\n\"...and as for photographic evidence! They produced this of Lindwall once, which showed clearly that his back foot was either over the line or in the air before the ball was delivered, but on the eve of the 1948 tour of England and a pending dispute about Lindwall, in particular, somebody let the story out that Tate and Larwood were also shown once in a film to be over the line before the ball was delivered. As O'Reilly vehemently argues, it is humanly impossible for a ball to be delivered legitimately with the back foot still on the ground and behind the line, and so everybody forgot about that one.\"\n\"Trying to recall who was responsible for the front-foot law is a tax on the memory. Some will say it was Gordon Rorke. Others would want the privilege shared by Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson and a couple of South Australian pace bowlers, Peter Trethewey and Alan Hitchcox. I am more inclined to lean towards Con Simons and Pat Crawford.\"\nIn modern cricket the bowler is no-balled if he bowls without some part of the front foot (either grounded or raised) behind the popping crease and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1950s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease. The 1958-59 series was a catalyst towards the change as fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease in order to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but sometimes they would drag it over the line and they would be no-balled. The dust raised by the dragging foot and the distance between the bowling hand and the dragging foot of some six or seven feet made it difficult for umpires to make the correct decision. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease. See Film on YouTube. It should have been called as a no-ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire and impossible for the bowler."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1970–71",
        "text": "The 1970–71 Australians lost 2–0 to the touring England team in the 1970–71 Ashes series. Australia had not lost a home Test series since 1954–55, but had suffered a heavy 4–0 defeat in South Africa in 1969–70 which had affected their confidence. On paper they should have had a good team, and E.W. Swanton reckoned they were favourites to hold on to The Ashes, but Rod Marsh, Dennis Lillee and Greg Chappell had yet to mature and Bill Lawry, Garth McKenzie and John Gleeson were at the end of their careers. In more fortunate circumstances the senior players could have eased the newcomers into the team, but Ray Illingworth was a captain who exploited every weakness and they did not get the chance. Their cause was not helped by the selectors Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey who chose nineteen different players in the series, nine of them debutants, and continuously chopped and changed the team which did not allow it to settle.\nThe Captain.\n\"It was in South Africa in 1969–70 that his batting, and with it his captaincy, began to falter. The unfortunate experiences he and his men endured in India prior to visiting South Africa, those incidents there and on and off the field, began to affect his outlook, converted it, I feel, into what might be called an inlook...He had to survive investigation of his leadership by the Australian Board of Control in the light of adverse reports from the authorities of both India and South Africa. I believe Bill Lawry had developed a sizable chip on his shoulder before the summer of 1970–71.\"\nBill Lawry succeeded his opening partner Bobby Simpson as Australian captain midway through the victorious 4–0 series victory over India in 1967–68, he retained the Ashes 1–1 in 1968 and defeated the West Indies 3–1 in 1968–69. The 1969–70 the tour of India was successful – Australia won 3–1 – but the non-smoking, non-drinking Lawry had little time for the social side of the tour, was unable to maintain good public relations and manager Fred Bennett submitted an unfavourable report. In the subsequent tour of South Africa he lost 4–0 and he sent the Australian Cricket Board a list of player grievances. According to vice-captain Ian Chappell, \"That was the end of Lawry as captain of Australia. Then it was just a matter of finding any excuse to get rid of him\". In 1970–71 he was determined to retain the Ashes, but chose to do this by batting every match into a draw and was criticised by his cautious, negative captaincy. With a victory required in the final Test to even the series and retain The Ashes the selectors dismissed Lawry, the first time an Australian captain had been dropped in mid-series. They failed to inform Lawry, who heard the news on the radio and was soon besieged by reporters. He accepted the verdict with his usual stoicism, but it was the end of his Test career and Australia lost a great opening batsman aged only 33. His successor Ian Chappell was far more aggressive and inspirational captain, but lost the last Test and with it The Ashes. However he recreated the Australian team in his own image and by 1974–75 it would be the most powerful Test team in the world.\nBatting.\nOn paper Australia had a sound batting line up; Bill Lawry (47.15), Ian Redpath (43.45), Keith Stackpole (37.42), Doug Walters (48.26), Ian Chappell (42.42), Greg Chappell (53.86), wicket-keeper Rod Marsh (26.51) and all-rounder Kerry O'Keeffe (25.76). None of these failed in the series, but the state batsmen who were called up to fill in the gaps were not capable of facing the English bowling attack. Although they batted out a draw in four of the Tests they collapsed twice in the second innings of the Sydney Tests, the only wicket that did not favour the bat. Bill Lawry was a dour left-handed opening batsman with tremendous concentration who was once unfairly described as \"a corpse with pads on\". He failed to make a century, but still made 324 runs (40.50) and carried his bat through the Australian debacle at Sydney. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Keith Stackpole was a heavily built opening batsman perfectly capable of hitting the ball round the ground, he made 627 runs (52.25) and two centuries in the series, but had the benefit of five \"lives\" from the umpires. Ian Redpath was another opening batsman, but tall and ungainly, making 497 safe runs (49.70) at his own slow pace, \"I liked bowling to him least of all\" Snow wrote, \"a real nuisance batsman\". Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team. The other was wicket-keeper Rod Marsh who was chosen for his batting skills rather than his glovemanship. Despite being right-handed in everything else he batted left-handed and was a very powerful hitter of the ball. The entertaining Doug Walters made 205 not out for New South Wales against the tourists and 112 in the First Test, but had developed a distaste for fast bowling in South Africa and John Snow took advantage of his cavalier play by feeding him short balls on the off-stump with a pair of gully fielders. Ian Chappell would later say \"three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me\"., as a result of working on his hook shot after his encounters with John Snow, but he still made 452 runs (37.66) and two fighting centuries in the series. His younger brother Greg would be regarded as the best Australian batsmen for decades, but in this series was limited to leg-side play and could not hope to match his famous maiden Test century in the later games.\nBowling.\nAs with their batting Australia could muster a strong and varied bowling attack; Garth McKenzie (29.78), Dennis Lillee (23.92), Alan Connolly (29.22), Ashley Mallett (29.84), John Gleeson (36.20) and Terry Jenner (31.20) with all-rounders Doug Walters (29.08), Kerry O'Keeffe (38.20) and Greg Chappell (40.70). Unfortunately, they were seldom given the chance to settle into the team and only Gleeson of the regular bowlers played in five Tests. Garth McKenzie had been Australia's premier fast bowler in the 1960s, but had failed spectacularly in South Africa (averaging 333.00), was struck in the face by a John Snow bouncer at Sydney and retired from Test cricket to play for Ray Illingworth's Leicestershire as a professional. Alan Connolly had been a fast bowler in his youth, but slowed his pace to increase his accuracy and became a reliable support bowler. Alan Thomson – \"Froggie\" Thomson – was a fast-medium paceman with a \"strange, whirlwind, running-through sort of action\" in which he loosed the ball while both feet were in the air. He was a non-smoking, non-drinking, physical education teacher whose shaggy red hair make him look like a 'Wild Man of Borneo'. He frequently bounced the England batsmen, took 6/80 against the MCC for Victoria and was called up for the First Test. 'He can't last' predicted Richard Whitington, 'He doesn't even know where he's aiming', and he averaged 54.50 in the Tests. John Gleeson was a mystery bowler who used his bent middle finger to turn the ball either way, but lost control in search of variation and was punished by the England batsmen once they figured out his action. The more orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply and took 28 wickets (19.10) in India in 1969–70. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and he became the spinning arm of Ian Chappell's all-conquering Australians. Historically Australian selectors always preferred a leg-spinner and Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner vied for the place, but they never quite fulfilled their promise. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced \"Golden Arm\" was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The greatest Australian bowler of the next decade would be Dennis Lillee, but in 1970 he was a raw, undisciplined fast bowler who had yet to reach his full potential.\nFielding.\nThe Australians have always produced good fielding teams and this was no exception, though Rod Marsh left a lot to be desired. His missed several chances in the first Test and was nicknamed \"Iron Gloves\" due to his inability to take the ball cleanly. He dropped three catches in the First Test, but held onto four others and would later develop into one of cricket's great wicket-keepers. Keith Stackpole and the Chappell brothers were superb slip-fielders, Ashley Mallett a specialist in the gully and Ian Redpath a remarkable close fielder anywhere.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test – Perth.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nThird Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nFirst One Day International – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nSixth Test – Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\"\nSeventh Test – Sydney.\n\"See Main Article – 1970–71 Ashes series\""

        "title": "1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain",
        "text": "The 1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain was made by a group of New Zealand rugby footballers who played matches in Australia, Ceylon, England and Wales between 1907 and 1908. Most of the matches were played under the rules of the Northern Union, a sport that is today known as rugby league. As such, the team were the immediate predecessors of the New Zealand national rugby league team. The tour had a large role in establishing rugby league in both Australia and New Zealand, and also gave birth to international rugby league. The tour party has come to be known as the professional All Blacks or All Golds, although at the time they were commonly referred to as the All Blacks—a named popularised by the New Zealand rugby union team that toured the Northern Hemisphere in 1905.\nThe idea for a professional rugby tour was conceived by Albert Baskiville, a player from the Wellington region of New Zealand. Baskiville managed to recruit a significant number of international and provincial representatives for the team; including George Smith who toured with the All Blacks team of 1905. The team played their first match in Sydney in 1907 against New South Wales. The success of the team's three matches in Sydney prompted the formation of the New South Wales Rugby League, and also saw them recruit Australian Dally Messenger for their tour of Wales and England. After stopping over in Ceylon, the team arrived in England on 30 September 1907. The team played 35 matches in England and Wales, including a Test match against Wales, and three Tests against England. They returned via Australia where they played a further ten matches, including three Test matches against Australia. They won a total of 26 of their 46 matches.\nThe tour firmly established rugby league in both New Zealand and Australia, and was commemorated by a centenary tour in 2007—the 2007 All Golds Tour.\nBackground.\nRugby union had established itself as the national winter game in New Zealand even before the 1905 tour of The Original All Blacks. This tour was a success both on the field and commercially off the field, with the New Zealand Rugby Union making a profit of £12,000. However, in New Zealand some discontent about the state of rugby union's rules and the lack of ability to compensate players for time lost from work were beginning to rise. These tensions were similar to the ones that had led to the 1895 schism in England that had created the Northern Union. In addition the Originals were only paid 3/- a day expenses while on tour, a token amount when the Rugby Union was making such a profit.\nTour preparations.\nAlbert Baskiville was well known in rugby circles, playing for the Oriental club and on the verge of Wellington provincial selection. He had also in 1907 published a book entitled \"Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods\" which explained how to play the game and was widely read. He was inspired to launch a tour to play the clubs in the Northern Union by an article in the \"Daily Mail\" written by F W Cooper. The article, written by a Northern Union advocate, said that while the Originals tour had been successful it was a shame that they had not played any of the northern clubs, which at the time of the 1895 break away were regarded as some of the strongest clubs in England. Baskiville had conversations with several prominent rugby players, including the famous Original George William Smith who had talked to Northern Union officials and J J Giltinan about starting the code in Sydney. Smith's role in starting the game in Australasia was crucial as he had a wide set of connections and was a well known sporting celebrity, being an Original, a world class sprinter and a champion jockey.\nIn early 1907 Baskiville wrote to the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU) asking if they would wish to host a tour of a New Zealand rugby team. As the North of England had not had any international rugby since the tour of the 1888-1889 New Zealand Native football team, the NRFU was enthusiastic. On 26 March 1907 it advised its member clubs that it was \"very favourably disposed\" to the tour and suggested that the tourists be paid 70% of the gates with a guarantee of £3000. The Northern Union informed Baskiville that the tour should go ahead and by May plans were firmly underway in New Zealand. Baskiville then resigned his job at the New Zealand Post Office to plan the tour full-time.\nNews of the tour was first publicly broken by the \"New Zealand Herald\" which ran a story on 13 May 1907 about a possible professional rugby tour. It was extraordinary the level of secrecy that the New Zealand organisers had achieved, with the news being broken via England. Opposition to the tour was vocal with the New Zealand Rugby Union condemning the tour and the media being generally supportive of the amateur game and its ideals of amateurism. However, as the co-operative nature of the tour became more widely known the touring party gained some public sympathy and the Rugby Union appeared to be increasingly the one out of touch with public opinion.\nBaskiville assembled a team of selectors; Duncan McGregor, Massa Johnston, Hercules Richard Wright and George William Smith, and they began to think about the type of players they wished to bring on the tour. Knowing the rule changes that the Northern Union had made to their game the selectors knew line-out specialists would not be required and decided to favour players with ample amounts of speed and acceleration. They also needed players that were prepared to invest some money into the venture and probably accept a lifetime ban from rugby union. In the end no less than 160 of the roughly 200 rugby union players involved in provincial rugby in New Zealand applied to go on the tour, a huge blow to the Rugby Union who had anticipated a low amount of interest. It was from these applications that the final team was selected, with players who had indicated early they were prepared to tour being favoured. At least two rugby union internationals did not tour, \"Opai\" Asher declined due to a broken ankle and George A. Gillett had to pull out at short notice due to injury. Both were to switch to rugby league later on in their careers. In the end the tour included nine internationals and fourteen provincial players, a large number selected from the Wellington and Auckland teams that had recently been battling over the Ranfurly Shield.\n1907 in Australia.\nWith the tour plans well underway George Smith contacted Peter Moir, a prominent Sydney player, asking if it would be possible to arrange a set of games in Sydney. Moir contacted others including J J Giltinan, who Smith had already talked to, before replying that a series of games would be able to be arranged. Rugby players in Sydney shared many of the New Zealand players' concerns about payment and rules. On 8 August 1907 the New South Wales Rugby League was formed. The New South Welshmen organised quickly and were ready to welcome the New Zealanders when the main touring party arrived on 13 August 1907. The New South Wales rugby union side had defeated the New Zealand rugby union team 14–0 in their second of two matches in 1907 and so were expected to be tough opponents, especially as the professional All Blacks had yet to form combinations and several of the Auckland-based players had not yet arrived in Sydney.\nThe first game was played on the Royal Agricultural Society Ground to a sold-out crowd of 20,000. Played under rugby union rules, the visitors led 6–0 at halftime and closed out the match, winning 12–8. The stars of the first game were Richard Wynyard for New Zealand and Dally Messenger for the New South Wales side. The game was deemed to be a great success, as the organisers had not expected a crowd over 12,000.\nThe second game, a mid-week game, was held in front of a crowd of approximately 3,000. The All Blacks, who had made several changes, defeated the \"All Blues\" 19–5.\nThe New Zealanders then won the third match of the series 5–3 in front of a crowd of 8,000 at the Agricultural Ground. Dally Messenger, playing his first game as captain, again starred and was invited to join the touring party.\nIt is unclear when the decision to invite Messenger was made, with some reports saying that he was recommended to Baskiville in New Zealand by George Gillett when he had to withdraw from the touring party due to injury. Messenger's name was included on the contract bought over from New Zealand, indicating that the decision had already been made. However, Messenger's form against the All Blacks in Sydney was certainly good enough to warrant his inclusion in the touring party. A fourth match had originally been planned in Melbourne, as an attempt to foster rugby in the city, but the plans fell through for unknown reasons. Instead the All Blacks left Australia, having earned £600 from the three games. During their short stay the tourists had helped kick-start the professional movement in Sydney. While leaving Australia news came through that the New Zealand Rugby Union had issued life bans to all of those involved in the tour.\nThe financial success of the All Golds' games in Sydney gave valuable momentum to Giltinan and Co.'s scheme to introduce a professional district rugby football competition in Sydney the following season.\n1907-08 in England and Wales.\nWhile on the long sea voyage from Australia, the men tried to keep fit by training on the deck. During a stop over in Ceylon the team was challenged to a game by the Ceylon rugby union. The All Blacks won the match against 33–8. As a result of this match the rugby union New Zealand side declined to play the Ceylonese on the return leg of their tour, deeming that Ceylon had forfeited their amateur status by playing against Baskerville's men.\nDuring the voyage the tourists also played a game of cricket against the ships officers and first class passengers and were again victorious, winning by an innings. McGregor and Messenger proved to be the best bowlers in the touring party.\nThe arrival of the team was met with great anticipation in the Yorkshire and Lancashire, areas that had been devoid of international competition for so long. The exciting play of the 1905 Originals and the reports that the current side had won three matches in Australia only heightened the expectations of the hosts. The \"RMS Ortona\", carrying the touring side, berthed in Marseilles, France and the squad took a train to Boulogne before they boarded the \"Empress\". They reached England on 30 September 1907, arriving in Folkestone. The visitors were met by the main officials of the Northern Rugby Football Union. The team stayed the night in London, where the Northern Union officials introduced the side to the press – near the headquarters of the English Rugby Union. The next day the side travelled north to Leeds where they were met at the station by a crowd of about 6,000, all keen to see the touring All Blacks. After they had arrived the tourists had two weeks before their first game. They spent the time based in Leeds, training and adapting to both the new rules of the Northern Union and the colder climate. They also watched Leeds and Hunslet play a local derby game – the first time they had seen the new rules in operation.\nThe first game was held on 9 October 1907 against Bramley. Around 8,000 spectators packed McLaren Field in Bramley to see the All Blacks win 25–6 in their first game under the Northern Union rules. In their second game against Huddersfield the tourists, keen for as many players as possible to get a run, selected a team mostly made up of players who were not involved in the first match. They still managed to defeat Huddersfield, winning 19–8 with Lance Todd playing a key role in the game played before a crowd of over 10,000. After the first two matches the touring side met with the Northern Union and discussed the first two games; they also received their first payment – a cheque for £448–15–6. The tour then moved on to Lancashire where the team played Widnes at Naughton Park before a new ground record crowd, resulting in a 26–11 victory. Just two days later the visitors met the Broughton Rangers, who were at the time a powerhouse of the Northern Union. Regarded as the All Blacks' \"first big test\" the match was played in front of a large crowd of 24,000. New Zealand took an early lead in the game and, despite a spirited Broughton comeback in a torrential downpour, held out to win 20–14.\nThe All Blacks next travelled to Wakefield to play Wakefield Trinity. The tourists rested several key players for this game and badly underestimated their opponents. New Zealand fell behind early and only managed to salvage a 5-all draw. Stung by the result, the All Blacks decided to select their best team to take on Leeds. They went on to win 8–2, despite winning only one out of every five scrums. After this match the tourists received their second cheque, this one for £1036-10-8, and it was already clear that the tour was going to record a healthy profit. During this second meeting with the Northern Union the visitors requested that two more test matches be added to the itinerary, turning it into a three-match test series. For the other two matches the Northern Union first contacted the Crystal Palace Football Club. However negotiations fell through and the second test was instead scheduled to take place at Chelsea Football Club's Stamford Bridge. The third match was scheduled for Whaddon Road in Cheltenham, the same ground that the amateur All Blacks had played on several years earlier. For the Northern Union this series of matches represented a chance to expand their game into areas of England dominated by rugby union and association football. Also at this time the New Zealand team, with an increasing list of injuries, moved their base from Leeds to Ilkley, a spa town in Yorkshire.\nThe tour's next match was in St. Helens where the team visited the birthplace of Richard Seddon before playing St. Helens, winning 24–5. The All Blacks then moved on to Wales to play Merthyr Tydfil, the club having only recently converted to the Northern Union code. The side won 27–9 and then returned to Ilkley with a number of injuries. Their next match was against Keighley, one of the top teams in the league, on Guy Fawkes Day and Smith, Messenger, Billy Wynyard, Cross and Gilchrist were all unavailable. 8,000 supporters turned up to the match, Keighley's biggest gate at the time, and Keighley led at half time. However the All Blacks fought back and won the match 9–7 to remain unbeaten after two months of football.\nThe next game was against Wigan, already by this time one of the giants of the game. A massive crowd of 30,000 supporters packed in to see their local side take on the New Zealanders. The tourists fielded the strongest side they were able to, although several players were missing or playing out of position due to injuries. Despite playing well the All Blacks went down 12–8 to Wigan to record their first loss on the tour after fourteen matches. The tourists' next game was against Barrow, their first game in Cumberland. The team arrived in Barrow late, having had a train be delayed, and the weather was poor. Barrow were able to frustrate New Zealand, who could not play open football in the weather, and the All Blacks suffered their second loss in a row, going down 6–3. They next had to travel to Kingston upon Hull where they took on the Hull F.C. The game was a higher scoring affair and the visitors were able to come out winners, 18–13. For their next game, against Leigh, the weather was again poor and the All Blacks were again beaten in the rain, losing 15–9. They lost again in their next match, as 15,000 spectators watched Oldham win 8–7 in drenching rain and, in the second half, a snowstorm. By now it was established that in good weather the visiting side were able to beat anybody, however in the wet weather their backs were not able to handle the ball and matches were a much closer affair. During the next Wednesday's game New Zealand were again defeated in the rain, dominated by the Runcorn RFC forwards they lost 9–0. After a string of defeats and poor weather the side's management decided to re-locate and the team was moved to Manchester, seeking slightly better weather.\nThe touring side next played a combined Dewsbury and Batley side, winning 18–8 in fine conditions, and backed this up by defeating Swinton 11–2 and Rochdale Hornets 19–0. The New Zealanders were then upset by Bradford F.C., who defeated then 7–2 in gale-force winds and driving rain. This was backed up with another loss, going down to Halifax, the League champions, 9–4. The All Blacks' next game was against Yorkshire, the first of their matches against County representative sides. The visitors were ready for this game and defeated the proud rugby county 23–4. New Zealand's next game was against the current Challenge Cup holders, Warrington. Ten thousand spectators watched the Warrington side pip the All Blacks 8–7 despite the visitors being ahead 7–5 at half time. The tourists spent Christmas Day in Manchester before heading to Leeds to take on Hunslet in a boxing day match. New Zealand were ahead 9–0 at halftime and were leading 11–8 in the second half when the home team had a player sent off, the first of the tour. However Hunslet still managed to score and the final result was an 11-all draw. Two days later the tourists played Salford, and won 9–2 in front of 12,000 people.\nThe test matches.\nWales.\nNew Year's Day saw the touring party head to Wales for their first international match. Aberdare Athletic Ground was the venue of the first ever rugby league international on 1 January 1908, played between Wales and New Zealand. The New Zealand Rugby League later recognised this match as New Zealand's first test match. Aberdare had been chosen for the venue as it could hold a larger capacity than Merthyr, in the end 20,000 Welshmen turned up. The Welsh side contained a former Welsh amateur international as well as several players who had been playing in the Northern Union for years.\nNew Zealand led the match 8–3 at halftime but the Welsh came back and Dai Jones scored a try with only minutes to go that put the Welsh 9–8 in front. Dick Wynyard then dropped a pass in front of the try line and the Welsh won the first international rugby league match.\nThe day after the game the touring party left Wales, heading back to Kingston upon Hull for their second visit, this time to play the Hull Kingston Rovers. The All Blacks somewhat rebounded, winning 6–3 in a tightly fought contest. Reaching the business end of the tour, the New Zealanders next headed north to play the representative Cumberland side. Here they were defeated 21–9 after resting several key players for the international against England.\nEngland.\nThe tourist next played an England XIII at Central Park in Wigan. 12,000 spectators turned up despite the ground being frozen – necessitating a layer of straw to be placed over the top. The conditions favoured an open game and by half time the score was 11-all. In the end England ran out winners 18–16, meaning the New Zealanders had now lost two internationals. After the match the All Blacks were invited to visit the Duke of Portland's residence and they were pleased to be able to meet the famous New Zealand racing horse Carbine, all of the touring party being given a small lock of the horse's hair as a parting gift.\nThe tourists now moved their base to Blackpool but their form did not improve, losing to the Lancashire county team 20–4. Going into the three test series against the Northern Union it was clear that they were not full of confidence.\nGreat Britain.\nTest one.\nGoing into the first test Dally Messenger, Duncan McGregor and Conrad Byrne were all unavailable due to influenza. Great Britain was boosted by England and Wales having both already played New Zealand, the two teams had then played each other to complete the tri-series. The weather too was poor, thick fog blamed for a low crowd, half of the 16,000 that had been predicted.\nAfter thirty minutes it the game was still scoreless, until Jolley finally broke the deadlock with a drop goal. By half time Great Britain was up 8–0. Hubert Turtill scored soon after halftime and then Dick Wynyard missed an opportunity to level the scores after he had taken an intercept at halfway but failed to reach his support. Robinson then scored to put the home side ahead 14–3. Wynyard then scored a late try but it was not enough and the All Blacks were again defeated, losing the first ever test match between New Zealand and Great Britain.\nThe tourists then lost again, this time going down 5–3 in a mid week game against York. January had not been a good month for the All Blacks with just one win from seven. Leading up to the second test the New Zealanders returned to Wales to play Ebbw Vale on 1 February. Here they finally returned to the winning circle, winning 3–2.\nTest two.\nThe second test was the first time that rugby league had been played in London, and as a result the match was deemed to be important for the Northern Union's chances of expanding into the rest of England.\nIn the second test match New Zealand completely outplayed Great Britain, with the home side being held score less until the last five minutes. The tourists' win set up the series at 1-all and the spotlight then moved to Cheltenham, the scene of the third and deciding test match.\nTest three.\nThe morning before the third and final test match was filled with rain. The weather may have contributed to the reduced crowd, although the game was being played in the Midlands in an area that was a stronghold of rugby union. The Great Britain selectors had made a series of changes for the third match and had included Billy Batten, who was making his international debut. In contrast the visitors' team remained unchanged from their win in the second test.\nThe British began the game on the attack and scored early through a White penalty. Because of the conditions the match developed into a forwards slog. Just before half time Great Britain scored and took a 5–0 lead into the break. However, with the wind at their backs, the New Zealanders dominated the second half. They were held out by the British however until, with just seven minutes to go, the tourists finally scored through Messenger. The try was converted and the score was 5-all. With a few minutes remaining Tom \"Angry\" Cross was sent off. This seemed to inspire the All Black forwards and they pushed hard in a scrum near the British line, resulting in Massa Johnston crashing over to score the winning try. The New Zealand side therefore had won the first rugby league test series 2–1.\nThe tourists then returned North for their final game in England, a re-match against St Helens R.F.C. Albert Baskiville played in his first match of the tour, scoring a try as New Zealand won 23–10. The side then prepared to return to New Zealand via Australia, although several players opted to stay behind and sign professional contracts with British clubs. George William Smith signed with Oldham for £150 while Lance Todd signed with Wigan for a massive £400 as well as the captaincy. Duncan McGregor, Joseph Lavery and Jim Gleeson all also opted to stay behind, with McGregor opening a sports shop and playing for Merthyr Tydfil, Lavery signing with Leeds and Gleeson completing his legal studies at the Inns of Court. The rest of the team left Great Britain on 29 February 1908.\n1908 in Australia.\nThe New Zealanders arrived in Australia on 9 April 1908 lacking match fitness after the sea voyage and being short of backs. Several had stayed in Britain and Messenger was to revert to his home teams to play for New South Wales and Australia against the tourists. The All Blacks therefore called up James Barber, a provincial scrum half and utility player who had previously represented Wellington. They then spread themselves around the eight New South Wales Rugby Football League clubs that were preparing for the 1908 NSWRFL season, Australia's first in rugby league, and helped advise them on the rules of the new game.\nThe tourists stayed in Sydney long enough to watch the first round of the new premiership season, which began on Easter Monday, before heading north to Newcastle. Here they played a Newcastle side at rugby union, defeating them 53–6. They then played a \"Northern Districts\" selection and defeated them 37–8 in the first ever game of rugby league played in Newcastle. The visit by the touring New Zealand side boosted the profile of rugby league in Newcastle as the Newcastle Rebels were at the time playing all their matches away in Sydney. As a result of the visit playing numbers in Newcastle surged and in 1910 the Rebels dropped out of the Sydney competition to form their own league.\nThe touring side then returned to Sydney for two matches against New South Wales. The first game was played on 2 May. Sydney had produced a very warm day for the match and the Australian ground suited the open passing of the new Northern Rugby Football Union's rules. The Blues were ahead 14–7 at half time and went on to win the match 18–10. The crowd was impressed with the new code and remained behind after the match to applaud the two teams. This game helped ensure that rugby league would become the dominant winter code in New South Wales. The second game was just as open and the New South Wales side again managed to win 13–10, with the All Blacks being denied a try on full-time by a linesman's call.\nTest one.\nThe first test, Australia's inaugural rugby league international, was shaping up to be an even encounter, with the tourists having regained their match fitness and most of the newly formed Australian side having been involved in the preceding series with New South Wales. The Australian selectors were determined to include some Queenslanders in the side and three were selected, despite no games of rugby league having yet been played in Queensland. Sydney again produced a nice day and 20,000 spectators turned up to see the first ever test match between the ANZAC nations.\nNew Zealand took control from the start, despite having Massa Johnston wrongly sent off early in the match. By halftime it was 11–2 to the visitors. The Second half however was all Australia and they scored twice to make the score 11–10. With full-time nearing Messenger had two penalty shots but uncharacteristically missed both and the New Zealanders held on to win the first ever test match between the two sides 11–10. Messenger's kicking had been off all game, he had only kicked two despite having fourteen attempts. Albert Baskiville on the other hand had played in his first test match and won much praise with his performance, deserving his try. It would also turn out to be the only test match he ever played. Precisely 100 years later this match was commemorated on 9 May 2008 in the Centenary rugby league test at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\nThe tourists then headed north to Brisbane for a series of matches leading up to the second test match. The visit did much to kick start rugby league in Queensland. The matches played by the visiting New Zealand side were the first games of rugby league played in the state, despite three Queensland players having already represented the Kangaroos in the first test in Sydney. Baskiville had become ill on the sea voyage up from Sydney and he did not play again for the tourists, being admitted to hospital. The first game, without Baskiville was held on 16 May against Queensland. The Queensland side included Bill Hardcastle who had been an All Black in 1897 before moving to Queensland. New Zealand ran out winners 34–12 in a match that impressed the press and the spectators. The midweek game was against a Brisbane Metropolitan side and the tourists ran out winners 43–10. After the match the players rushed to the Victoria Private Hospital to check on Baskiville. They found him unconscious and his condition quickly deteriorated. Albert Baskiville died late in the afternoon and of 20 May 1908. Harry Palmer headed home with his casket accompanied by a group of players representing each province. Baskiville was buried at Karori Cemetery in Wellington. In the meantime the remaining players had to prepare for the further two test matches. In the build-up they drew 12-all with the same Queensland side that they had earlier beaten 34–12.\nTest two.\nAfter the Queensland rugby league team played its first two matches ever against the touring New Zealanders, who also played a match against Brisbane, the Second Test match against Australia was played in Brisbane and 6,000 spectators turned up to watch the first test match to be held in the state. The All Blacks, still grieving over the loss of Baskiville, could only field a skeleton team and did not perform a pre-match haka.\nAs they did in the first test New Zealand dominated early in the match, with Harold Rowe scoring early, and by half time the New Zealanders led 15–2. The Second half was no easier for the Australians, and the All Blacks ran out winners 24–12 in one of the most decisive test match displays ever put on by a New Zealand side.\nThe tourists then headed back to Sydney to prepare for their final match. While they had been in Brisbane the first New Zealand Māori rugby league team had arrived in Sydney on 29 May for their own tour of Australia. The side was led by \"Opai\" Asher and was to prove another boost to the finances of the New South Wales Rugby Football League.\nTest three.\nThe touring New Zealand Māori rugby league team were at the Showgrounds supporting New Zealand side for the final test, which drew a crowd of 14,000.\nThe game developed into a tight, low-scoring affair, and the visitors were ahead 6–0 at halftime. They then extended their lead to 9–3 before Australia came back and then ran out winners 14–9, claiming the country's first test match victory in the final match of the New Zealand tour.\nThe second visit to Australia by the tourists had done much to boost the game in the country. They had played the first ever rugby league matches in Newcastle and Brisbane and had boosted the coffers of the fledgling New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League organisations. The New Zealanders then headed home to very little fanfare, and certainly nothing to match the lavish official welcome that had been granted The Original All Blacks in 1905.\nAftermath.\nOn their return home the tourists an exhibition game at Athletic Park, the first game of rugby league in New Zealand. This match was played on 13 June 1908 and 8,000 people attended to see \"Wright's Blacks\" defeat \"Turtill's Reds\" 55–20. The match allowed the team to raise £300 for Mrs Baskiville, Albert's mother.\nThe tour itself had been a great success both financially -the tour made a £5,641 profit and each player received almost £300- and on the field, where the New Zealanders had defeated both Great Britain and Australia 2–1. These feats were not to be replicated for many years with the New Zealand national team failing to win another series in Australia until 1952 and in Great Britain until 1971.\nOther members of the touring party soon returned to join George William Smith, Lance Todd, Duncan McGregor and Joseph Lavery who were all playing in the Northern Union. Edgar Wrigley signed with Runcorn for £400 and a guarantee of employment as a plumber. Harold Rowe joined Leeds and Massa Johnston joined Lance Todd at Wigan. Hubert Turtill also joined St Helens before being killed in World War I. William Trevarthen and Conrad Byrne joined Huddersfield, where they were soon joined by Edgar Wrigley. Arthur Kelly joined Turtill at St Helens.\nFor the Northern Union the tour had given the game credibility and its first international test opponents since the breakaway code had been established.\nIn Australia the tour had helped spark the establishment of the game and helped offset the costs of the New South Wales Rugby League's expensive first season. Australia was soon to send its own touring party to Great Britain, although the side did not make as much of a profit as Baskerville's All Blacks had.\nIn New Zealand the \"Northern Union code\" did not manage to successfully establish itself as quickly as it did in Australia. Albert Baskiville had been the tour's chief organiser and his death was a huge blow to the game in New Zealand as well as the players personally. Baskiville had also been talking about arranging a tour of the United States of America before his death. In some ways the New Zealanders were too successful as the number of them signing professional contracts meant that there were fewer players to help establish the game back home. Daniel Fraser took a role in organising matches and at Victoria Park on 24 August 1908 8,000 people watched Auckland, captained by Richard Wynyard, defeat Wellington 16–14 in the first provincial match in New Zealand. The two sides met in Petone on 12 September and drew 13-all. A New Zealand side toured Australia in 1909, including six of the original touring party. In Auckland Billy Tyler and Charlie Dunning helped to form the Ponsonby Ponies club while William Mackrell was involved in establishing the Newton rugby league club and the Auckland Rugby League competition started in 1910. The New Zealand Rugby Football League was formally established on 25 April 1910 in preparation for a Great Britain tour later that same year. The Wellington and Canterbury Rugby League competitions were not to start until 1913.\nLegacy.\nIn 2002 a Baskerville Shield was created to be contested each time New Zealand took on Great Britain. In 2007 the team was commemorated by the 2007 All Golds Tour which featured an All Golds v Northern Union match as well as a three test series between the New Zealand national rugby league team and Great Britain. Steve Price played the role of Dally Messenger, playing in the All Golds match. The \"All Golds\", as they had also come to be known in the media due to their professionalism, then played their first ever match in New Zealand in 2008 when they took on the New Zealand Māori in a match that served as a warm up to the 2008 World Cup for the New Zealand national rugby league team.\nProfessional status.\nThe players on the tour did not consider themselves to be professionals. The members of the tour had all invested £50 and received back an equal share of the tours profits. At this stage none of the players played either rugby code as a career, although several became professionals after the tour had ended. They compared themselves to past tours such as the 1902 Australian cricket tour of England which had shared the profits of the tour and were still regarded as amateurs. The New Zealand Rugby Union considered the players to be professionals and all members of the tour subsequently received a life ban from rugby union.\nName.\nThe team's registered title was \"The New Zealand All Black Rugby Football Team\" and it was most often referred to as the \"All Blacks\" on the tour, the same name which had been given to The Original amateur rugby union team on their tour of Great Britain in 1905. Like the Originals they were sometimes referred to in the press as \"New Zealand\" or other names such as \"Maorilanders\" and \"Colonials\". Less favourable members of the press referred to them as the \"All Golds\" or \"Pro Blacks\" — highlighting the fact that the team was playing for money. The term All Golds was first coined by the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" in 1907 as a headline. However colloquially the players would have probably referred to themselves as the All Blacks or the New Zealand rugby team.\nLater on, the New Zealand national rugby league team began to be known as the Kiwis instead of the All Blacks. Referring back to the 1907–08 team historians have often called them the \"professional All Blacks\" or \"All Golds\". The New Zealand Rugby League has made an effort to reclaim the name All Golds from the negative connotations it once held, and in 1997 fought a legal case over the use of the name with the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war. In 2007 and 2008 an All Golds team took the field to celebrate the centenary of international rugby league.\nSquad.\nThe side selected was regarded as surprisingly strong, given the secretive circumstances that it was selected, and included a good mix of experience (nine internationals and fourteen provincial players) and youth.\nBacks.\nOverall the backs possessed experience and pace. They were a strong attacking unit at the time when New Zealand rugby was well known for its attacking prowess. If the backs had a weakness it was in their defence, as the Northern Union game required stronger defensive skills and more one on one tackling than they were used to.\nOrganisation.\nAs the New Zealand Rugby League was not yet set up, the tour had no official administration body. The touring party legally formed itself into an organisation (\"The New Zealand All Black Rugby Football team\") and each played invested £50 of their own money, quite a sum at that time. The players were paid £1 per week for expenses and then the profits (if any) were to be divided equally at the end of the tour. No bonuses of any kind were paid. Albert Baskiville acted as the tours secretary and did much of the administrative work. He was supported by Harry Palmer (manager), Daniel Fraser (assistant manager) and Jim Gleeson (treasurer).\nDisputes while on tour were heard by a Management Committee. This consisted of Jim Gleeson, Harry Palmer, Duncan McGregory, Massa Johnston, Lance Todd, Bumper Wright and Bert Baskiville. This committee had the power to impose fines for indiscretions and even expel someone from the tour party if it was deemed to be necessary.\nHercules Richard Wright was elected the tours captain while George William Smith was elected vice-captain, a sign of the democratic nature of the tours organisation. These two formed the selection committee alongside Massa Johnston."

Up until a career ending injury, Murphy was considered one of the top defensive tackles in his class.\nHigh school career.\nMurphy attended Hoover High School in Alabama, where he made 142 tackles and 16 sacks in junior and senior seasons. A dominant force in the middle, Murphy helped Hoover to two straight Class 6A State Championships in 2005 and 2006. During that period, Hoover was featured on the MTV show \"Two-A-Days\".\nAfter receiving All-American honors by \"Parade\" as a senior, Murphy was selected to play in the 2006 Alabama North-South All-Star Game as well as the 2006 US Army All-American Bowl.\nConsidered a four-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Murphy was listed as the No. 4 defensive tackle prospect in the nation. He was also ranked as the No. 2 prospect from Alabama, behind only fellow Crimson Tide teammate Rolando McClain.\nMurphy chose Alabama over Auburn, Clemson, Miami, and Louisville, becoming the first commitment Nick Saban received after his hiring in January 2007.\nCollege career.\nAfter originally signing with the University of Alabama in the spring of 2007, Murphy failed to qualify that year, and after spending a year at Hargrave Military Academy, he missed again in 2008. Murphy signed one more time with the Crimson Tide in 2008, stayed another semester at Hargrave, then took more classes at Hoover's Cahaba School to raise his grade point average enough to meet NCAA eligibility standards.\nHe finally enrolled at Alabama in January 2009, and was a third-string back up for senior nose tackle Terrence Cody during the 2009 season. Murphy was unable to finish the 2010 season due to injury and was placed on medical hardship for the 2011 season. Murphy's injuries ended up being career ending as he never returned to play football. He continued his academic career at the University of Alabama and graduated on August 3, 2013. Kerry Murphy is a Commercial Vehicle Salesman at Mercedes-Benz of Birmingham, in Hoover, Alabama"

Smith, a native Scotsman from Carnoustie, was familiar with the links courses of his boyhood home.\nWawashkamo was laid out on a farmer's field that had been the site of the 1814 Battle of Mackinac Island. Separate historical markers commemorate both the golf links and the battlefield. The name of the club and course comes from the Chippewa word \"waawaashkaamon\" for the act of 'walking a crooked trail'.\nLongtime club pro Frank Dufina is believed to have had the longest tie between a course and a professional in U.S. golfing history.

With six Welsh clubs in the league the NU also established a Welsh League along the same lines as the existing Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues.\nWigan won their first Championship this season beating Oldham 7-3 in the play-off final. Wigan also ended the regular season as the league leaders. Oldham's appearance in the Championship final was the first time that a team from outside the top two in the league had reached the final.\nWigan won the Lancashire League. Halifax won the Yorkshire League. The Welsh League was won by Ebbw Vale.\nNorthern Rugby League.\nThe organisation of the Northern Rugby League, the senior competition for the clubs of the Northern Union, did not involve all the clubs playing all the others. The requirement was that clubs would play all the others from their own league (Yorkshire, Lancashire or Wales) home and away. In addition, at least four fixtures against clubs from other leagues also had to be played, any over this minimum were voluntary. This system meant that clubs played differing numbers of games and therefore the league table was based on win percentage (Win percentage was calculated by adding twice the number of wins to the number of draws and dividing this total by the number of games played to give a percentage between 0 and 100%). This fixture system meant a minimum of 28 games for the Yorkshire clubs and 26 for the Lancashire clubs. The Welsh clubs undertook to play eight games against the other Welsh teams and then an equal number of additional matches against English clubs, a minimum of 16 games.\nThe Welsh clubs had mixed fortunes, Merthyr Tydfil and Ebbw Vale, for whom this was the second season in the league, finished 8th (18 matches) and 14th (24 matches) respectively. The four new teams, Mid-Rhondda, Treherbert, Barry and Aberdare all finished in the bottom eight finishing 24th (18 matches), 28th (18 matches), 29th (18 matches) and 31st (17 matches) respectively. Aberdare failed to fulfil their last Northern league fixture, away at Wakefield. The disappointing results and the attendant lack of income and support made 1908–09 the only season in the Northern Union for three of thee Welsh teams, as Mid-Rhondda, Aberdare and Barry either left or were expelled from the Northern Union at the end of the season.\nThe joint top try-scorers were Joe Miller of Wigan and Frank Williams of Halifax with 49 each. James Lomas of Salford was the season's top scorer with 272 points (88 goals and 32 tries), Lomas's 88 goals also made him the leading goal scorer.\nPlay-offs.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 17 April 1909, Wigan beat Batley 18–2 while Halifax and Oldham drew 3–3. Oldham replayed Halifax on 21 April winning 8–2.\nFinal.\nThe Championship final was played on a rainy afternoon of 1 May 1909 before a crowd of around 12,000 at The Willows in Salford. In the third minute, Wigan took the lead through a penalty goal by Jim Leytham. Oldham however scored the first try when Bill Jardine crossed in the fifteenth minute. Wigan's Dick Ramsdale took his side back into the lead with a try in the thirtieth minute. Leytham converted to give Wigan a 7-3 lead at half time. No further points were scored during the match. Contemporary observers considered the match to have been a disappointing spectacle.\nCounty leagues.\nThe Yorkshire and Lancashire county leagues had been re-established the previous season. Team results from championship games played against clubs from the same county counted towards the county league. Halifax won the Yorkshire league and Wigan the Lancashire league. \nBribery case.\nIn November 1908, Edward Crofton, a Wigan coal dealer, was jailed for two months with hard labour for attempting to bribe two Wigan players, Lance Todd and Massa Johnston, to throw the club's game against Hunslet. The prosecution case was that, in September, Crofton had waited in a Wigan pub for the two players to come in and when they did arrive, he offered them £5 each and a share of the winnings from betting on Hunslet to beat Wigan the following Saturday. The two players did not take the suggestion seriously, thinking it was a joke, and left the pub. The following evening, the players were again in the pub and Crofton repeated the offer, increasing the amount offered to each player to £20. Again the players thought it was a joke but reported the matter to the club. The defendant maintained that the first meeting never took place and that the second occasion was simply a joke remark on his part and that he had never actually offered either player any money. As another Wigan player had testified that Crofton had been in the pub on the first occasion, the magistrates did not believe Crofton and unanimously convicted him of the offence.\nWelsh league.\nThe Welsh league was new for this season and worked on different principles from the county leagues. Instead of games between Welsh teams scoring for both the Northern league and the Welsh league, separate fixtures were played for each league resulting in each club's fixture list including four fixtures against each of the other Welsh clubs (two in the Northern league and two in the Welsh league). Not all the Welsh league matches were played as some of the clubs got into financial difficulties. Ebbw Vale won the Welsh league when they won their game against Mid-Rhondda at the beginning of April. Ebbw Vale beat a \"Rest of Welsh League\" side 20–0 in a season finale.\nChallenge Cup.\nWakefield Trinity beat Hull F.C. 17-0 in the final at Headingley, Leeds on 24 April 1909 to win their first Cup in their first final. This was Hull's second successive defeat in a Challenge Cup final, having failed to score a point in either final.\nCounty Cups.\nHalifax won the Yorkshire Cup beating Hunslet 9–5 in the final.\nWigan won the Lancashire Cup beating Oldham 10–9 in the final.\nInternational tour.\nThe Australia national rugby league team toured the United Kingdom and during the tour played all the Northern Union clubs except Bramley and Barry."

The Northern Union, motivated by the need to appeal to spectators to improve the game's finances and ensure its survival, and inspired by the attacking style of rugby displayed by the New Zealand rugby union team during their 1905 tour of Britain, revisited two areas of the game that were the focus of much debate: the optimum number of players per team and how play should continue once a tackle had been completed.\nSeason summary.\nHalifax won their second Championship in this season and Warrington their second Challenge Cup in three years.\nThis season also saw the introduction of the Championship Play-offs at the end of the season. Similar to the current Grand Final system in today's Super League, it involved the top four clubs playing in two semi finals (1v4, 2v3) and then a final with the winners being declared champions. This system was used until 1961-62.\nLiverpool City joined, but Brighouse Rangers, Castleford, Millom, Morecambe, and Normanton withdrew, reducing the competition to 27 teams. Pontefract resigned from the league and folded after 8 matches, and their record was expunged (8P 3W 5L 63PF 154PA).\nLiverpool City became the first of only six teams to record no wins in a league season. Three of the others were in wartime leagues.\nBradford had been playing at the Park Avenue ground until this year. A decision by the Park Avenue Directors to form a professional association football (soccer) club forced Bradford rugby club to reform and relocate at Greenfield Stadium later adding \"Northern\" to their name.\nThere was no county league competition this season. \nChallenge Cup.\nWarrington beat Oldham 17-3 in the final at Wheater's Field, Broughton, Salford before a crowd of 18,500 to win their second Cup in three seasons.\nCounty cups.\nBroughton Rangers beat Warrington 15–6 to win the Lancashire Cup, and Bradford F.C. beat Hull Kingston Rovers 8–5 to win the Yorkshire County Cup."

Each voter selects three players: a first-place selection is given five points, a second-place selection three points, and a third-place selection one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most overall points. The winners are announced every year in November during Nippon Professional Baseball's awards ceremony called NBP Awards.\nThe first recipient of the award was Eiji Sawamura. The most recent winners, in 2022, are Munetaka Murakami, from the Central League, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto , from the Pacific League. In 1940, Victor Starffin became the first player to win the award consecutively and multiple times. Eiji Sawamura and Kazuhisa Inao are the youngest players to receive the awards in 1937 and 1957, respectively, at the ages of 20. In 1988, Hiromitsu Kadota became the oldest player to receive the award at the age of 40.\nA majority of the MVP awards were given to players who played on the pennant winning team. There are a few cases where the MVP was awarded to a player who was not on the pennant winning team, however. These include 2 of Oh's MVP seasons in 1964 and 1974, Wladimir Balentien in 2013, Hisashi Iwakuma in 2008, and Hiromitsu Kadota in 1988. Only twice was the award given to a foreigner in both leagues; in 1989 with Ralph Bryant in the Pacific League and Warren Cromartie in the Central League, and in 2001 with Tuffy Rhodes in the Pacific League and Roberto Petagine in the Central League. \nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\nThere have been 22 players who have won the award multiple times. Sadaharu Oh currently holds the record for the most awards won, with nine. Hisashi Yamada (1976–1978) and Ichiro Suzuki (1994–1996) share the record for the most consecutive awards won. Yutaka Enatsu and Michihiro Ogasawara are the only players to have won the award in both the Central League and Pacific League.

        "text": "The 1903–04 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the ninth season of rugby league football.\nSeason summary.\nThe League Champions were Bradford and the Challenge Cup Winners were Halifax.\nKeighley and Huddersfield were demoted from the top division and replaced by Wakefield Trinity (champions) and St. Helens.\nAs the top two teams had finished level on points and Points Difference had not been introduced as a tie breaker yet, despite having a worse points difference, Bradford contested a play-off with Salford, that Bradford won 5-0.\nIn the Second Division, Manningham and Stockport were replaced by Pontefract, reducing the competition to 17 teams. Birkenhead Wanderers dropped the Wanderers from their name.\nThe second promotion place had to be decided by a play-off as Points Difference had not yet been introduced as a tie breaker. St. Helens beat Holbeck 7-0.\nThere was no county league competition this season.\nInternationals.\nOn 5 April 1904, the first ever International Rugby League match took place between England and Other Nationalities. It was played at Central Park, Wigan, having originally been scheduled for New Year's Day in Oldham. England lost 3-9 in a twelve sided match, with the opposition made up of ten Welshmen and two Scots. The crowd numbered just 6,000.\nDivision One.\nChampionship play-off: Bradford vs Salford 5-0\nDivision two.\nPromotion play-off: St. Helens vs Holbeck 7-0\nChallenge Cup.\nHalifax beat Warrington 8-3 in the final at Salford's The Willows before a paying crowd of 17,041, plus 1,000 additional guests, to become the second team to record back-to-back Cup wins. Halifax wouldn’t reach another final until 1921 nor win the Cup again until 1931."

        "title": "1958–59 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1958–59 Ashes series consisted of five cricket Test matches, each scheduled for six days with eight ball overs. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1958–59, and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. The England team led by Peter May was labelled the strongest ever to leave England. It had the formidable bowling attack of Fred Trueman, Frank Tyson, Brian Statham, Peter Loader, Jim Laker and Tony Lock; the all-rounder Trevor Bailey; the outstanding wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans; and the batting of Colin Cowdrey, Tom Graveney, Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter. They had won the last three Ashes series in 1953, 1954–55 and 1956, but lost the series 4–0 to Australia. It was one of the biggest upsets in Test cricket history and the biggest margin of defeat in an Ashes series since the 5–0 \"whitewashing\" inflicted by Warwick Armstrong's Australians in 1920–21.\nThe triumph of the Australian team was mainly due to its aggressive captain Richie Benaud, now regarded as one of the greatest captains in Test cricket, who led what appeared to be an average team to five series victories in succession. The Australian fielding was outstanding, turning many a half-chance into a catch. Their opener Colin McDonald made 519 runs (64.67), the first batsman to exceed 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950–51. Benaud and Alan Davidson had previously underperformed against England, but now realised their full potential. Benaud took 31 wickets (18.83), the most by an Australian in an Ashes series since Monty Noble in 1901–02, and Davidson 24 wickets (19.00).\nIn English eyes at least the defeat was partly the result of questionable umpiring and the even more questionable bowling actions of Ian Meckiff, Keith Slater, Jim Burke and Gordon Rorke. The team was also handicapped by a long list of injuries, with 12 of their players being unfit to play at some point on the tour.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\nThe First Test was, I honestly think, the dullest and most depressing I have ever watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection of a piece of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a bit to spare.\nPreliminaries.\nCompared to the Fifth Test against New Zealand at the Kennington Oval in 1958 England made only two changes to their team. Willie Watson had only just recovered from his knee operation and was replaced as the number three batsman by the in form Tom Graveney. Fred Trueman was laid low by lumbago, which also affected him when he arrived in Queensland in 1962–63, and was replaced by Peter Loader even though he had just recovered from a strained Achilles tendon and high temperature. Loader, Laker, Lock and Statham had taken plenty of wickets on tour and Graveney and captain Peter May had made the most runs. Australia also had two changes from their last team, the Fifth Test against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1957–58. Captain Ian Craig had resigned due to ill-health and was replaced by the debutant strokemaker Norm O'Neill and Peter Burge replaced Bobby Simpson, who was twelfth man. Australia did not recall the veteran Ray Lindwall even though he had taken 7/73 for Queensland against the MCC and had swung the ball prodigiously. After vice-captain Neil Harvey captained an Australian XI to a 345 run defeat against the MCC the selectors made the surprise choice of Richie Benaud as Australian captain. He had just succeeded Craig as the captain of New South Wales, but had yet to lead his state. There was a thunderstorm before the match which precluded net practise and the air was heavy, which made the loss of Trueman's swing bowling all the more meaningful.\nEngland first innings.\nFour years before Len Hutton had won the toss, put Australia in to bat and watched them made 601/8 declared. The week before Neil Harvey had said that \"the pitch at Brisbane was the best in Australia for batting\", but Keith Miller wrote \"the best thing Benaud could do for Australia was lose the toss\", No captain had put the opposition in to bat in an Ashes series and won since Johnny Douglas in the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 1911–12 Ashes series. Bearing this in mind it was a bad toss to win and May made the difficult decision to bat on a green wicket which looked favourable to the fast bowlers in the expectation that it would flatten out in the afternoon. Arthur Milton was surprised by a straight ball by Ian Meckiff (3/33), who had been spraying his deliveries up to two feet on either side of the stumps. Keith Miller recalled \"Meckiff was all over the place...the cynical reckoned he fired too wide to be hit...it was, in fact, the most erratic piece of fast bowling I had ever seen in a Test match. Yet it helped to put Australia on top\". Peter Richardson depended on neat deflections for many of his runs, but had not managed to adapt to the faster Australian wickets and Benaud fed in an extra slip and another when the England opener slipped the ball between the fielders until he was caught by Ken Mackay off Alan Davidson (3/36) and England were 16/2. Tom Graveney (19) was beaten several times by Davidson and was dropped by Norm O'Neill, who then damaged a finger fielding and was sent to hospital for x-rays. He added 46 with May (28) before wicket-keeper Wally Grout snapped them both up. Cowdrey (13) fell a great catch by Lindsay Kline and Godfrey Evans to another by Peter Burge. Benaud had made his new ball bowlers stay on for over an hour in their opening spell, and called them back for more until they were exhausted. He had been bowling to give them a rest, but now started on the long England tail. \"The Boil\" Trevor Bailey (Bailey was pronounced \"Boiley\" by the Australians) took two hours to make 27 in his own dull way, but hit a couple of boundaries after seeing Jim Laker do so. Davidson had to leave the field exhausted and Benaud (3/46) had Bailey stumped to end the innings for 134.\nAustralia first innings.\nThere was only time for two overs before stumps and Brian Statham made the ball lift outside the off-stump, which might have produced a wicket given another quarter of an hour, but Colin McDonald and Jim Burke survived the day on 8/0. The first day had produced only 142 runs and although the Saturday was bright and clear and good for batting, only 148 runs were made as an excellent England bowling attack regained the initiative and the Australian batsmen eked out the runs. Burke edged a catch to gully, but Trevor Bailey was too deep to catch it and after a slow start—and much to everybody's surprise—he peeled off a couple of cover-drives off Peter Loader. Loader was repeatedly no-balled and was replaced by Bailey and the openers took their partnership past fifty when the sightscreen was laboriously moved and Loader returned round the wicket to have Burke caught behind for 20. The teams went off for lunch at the fall of the wicket and returned on 55/1 with Neil Harvey coming in instead of Ken Mackay as announced by the scoreboard, indicating that Benaud wanted the runs to flow. Bailey had McDonald caught in slip for 42 in two hours and Norm O'Neill (who had not broken his finger as first thought) came in with the hopes of Australia hanging on his shoulders. May set a defensive field to limit his runmaking, but he hit his first ball for four before the runs dried up and he was outpaced by \"Slasher\" Mackay. Loader (4/56) caught Harvey l.b.w. after he had spent an hour making 14. Bailey (3/35) accounted for the out of form Peter Burge and had O'Neill was caught by a spectacular diving catch by Tom Graveney for 34 in 151 minutes, Jim Laker (2/15) had Mackay (16) caught behind, much to his displeasure and Australia ended the day on 156/6, 22 runs ahead. After the rest day Australia did not long survive the fall of Benaud (16) on the Monday morning, l.b.w. to Loader and the tail collapsed to 186 all out despite the best efforts of Alan Davidson (25), last man out to Laker.\nEngland second innings.\nEven Australia's collapse gave them a lead of 52 on a wicket which had dried out and looked a lot better for batting, but the England openers failed again. Peter Richardson was brilliantly caught and bowled by Richie Benaud who had relieved Alan Davidson. Peter May sent in Trevor Bailey—\"The Barnacle\"—at number three, a very negative move given his reputation as England should have been looking to runs. He was soon joined by Tom Graveney when Milton was caught by Wally Grout off Davidson at 34/2. The stylish Graveney was often criticised for getting out carelessly, but he survived two l.b.w. appeals in an over from Benaud, who beat the bat twice more without success. They took the score to 92/2 by the end of the day, a lead of 40 runs, with only 122 runs coming in the day. On the fourth day Graveney was halfway down the wicket going for an easy single when Bailey sent him back and he was run out for 36 after staying in for nearly three hours. May was soon out to Benaud (4/66), but Colin Cowdrey (28) stuck in for over two hours before he was caught by Lindsay Kline at grass level. Umpire McInnes was unsighted, but after a nod from Umpire Hays at square-leg umpire gave Cowdrey out, even though he was briefly called back by Harvey, who doubted that the ball had carried. \"The Boil\" remained glued to the crease for 357 minutes making the slowest 50 by an Englishman in Tests. \"Trevor was apt to enjoy playing a character part. 'Barnacle Bailey' as a sobriquet had stuck all too firmly...to the infinite frustration of the crowds—which here at Brisbane showed their feeling by simply staying away\" wrote E.W. Swanton, who questioned \"whether victory, if it should come, is worth the cost in terms of sterile, boring play that makes one sick at heart to watch\". To be fair to Bailey he had been hailed as a saviour playing in this fashion in 1953 and 1954–55 and was unlikely to change his style at the end of his career. Benaud did not help as he set the field to cut off the stonewaller's limited repertoire of strokes, with Meckiff bowling down the leg side. One pressman roused himself to ask when Bailey had last scored a run, \"Twenty minutes past two\" answered the England scorer George Duckworth, \"Today or yesterday?\" was the reply. Just before stumps Bailey suddenly rushed down the pitch to take a swipe at Mackay, missed and was bowled for 68. It was a strangely reckless end as a few more minutes would have allowed Peter May the use of the heavy roller in the morning to break up the wicket for his bowlers. Bailey had batted for 458 minutes and scored from only 40 of the 427 balls he faced. Only 106 runs were made in a full day's play, the lowest in an Ashes Test.\nAustralia second innings.\nComing back on the fifth and penultimate day Australia needed 146 runs to win and did so in style thanks to Norm O'Neill. The spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock were brought on early as May's only hope was that the pitch would take spin, but few balls turned and he maintained his defensive field placings. Laker had McDonald out for 15, and Lock dismissed Harvey for 23. Jim Burke looked uncomfortable and dug himself in while O'Neill started to hit the ball and ran for singles when other batsmen in the match were content to stand still. He rattled up 71 not out in under two hours and hooked Loader for his seventh boundary for the winning runs, Burke having spent over four hours making 28 not out, even slower than Bailey.\nResult.\nAustralia won the First Test by 8 wickets to go 1–0 up in the series, the fourth win in four Tests for Australia against England at the Woolloongabba. England's scoring rate of 23 runs in every 100 balls (the equivalent of 1.38 runs per six-ball over) was one of the worst in Test cricket, Australia made 34 runs off every 100 balls (the equivalent of 2.04 runs per six-ball over). The England manager Freddie Brown wanted to make an official complaint about Meckiff's bowling, but captain Peter May thought that it look like sour grapes. Instead they talked unofficially to the Australian chairman of selectors Sir Donald Bradman who retorted \"And what of the action of the England bowlers Tony Lock and Peter Loader?\" and that they should \"first of all put their own house in order\". It was an inauspicious start to the brighter cricket May had promised, which was needed to revive the fortunes of Australian cricket that was being ignored by its youth. \"The Future of Australian Cricket at Stake...the average young Australian is inclined to spend most of his weekends under water...and caring for his lady-friend. There are many other things to do in the sunshine than play cricket\".\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\nThe events of the Melbourne Test at the New Year would have tested the philosophical detachment of any cricket writer, of whatever school. I'm glad to see in my preview before the game I noted that the increase in doubtful actions had been the most remarkable aspect of Australian cricket on the tour, and I named three suspects—Meckiff, Slater and Burke. I said that both Slater and Burke had been no-balled, once in each case, for throwing, and that I hoped the Australian umpires would do their unpleasant duty if the 'be not entirely satisfied', as the Law ordains. Vain Hope!\nPreliminaries.\nThe loss of the First Test was not the end of the series and Peter May well remembered the crushing Brisbane defeat in the First Test of the 1954–55 Ashes series, which Len Hutton had won 3–1. Arthur Milton had returned to form with innings of 85 against Tasmania, but had broken his finger in a gutsy 37 against South Australia. With the spare opener Raman Subba Row nursing a broken wrist Willie Watson—who had been part of the 1950 FIFA World Cup England squad in Brazil—was brought in, but Trevor Bailey was promoted to the opening spot regardless of his paralysing influence at Brisbane. Fred Trueman had recovered from his back trouble to take 5/46 and 4/33 against South Australia and said he was fully fit, but was not chosen. Instead May preferred to keep the pace attack that had bowled so accurately in the first innings at Brisbane. The Australians dropped Peter Burge from their twelve-man squad and brought in the 22-year-old Keith Slater who had taken 4/33 for Western Australia in the first match of the tour and could bowl both fast-medium and off-spin. In the end he was twelfth man instead of the talented batsman Bobby Simpson, who made his Ashes debut.\nEngland first innings.\nThe wicket was greener than usual for the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the air was heavy again, the dark clouds dimming the ground, but the pitch was not expected to last and when Peter May won the toss on his 29th birthday (New Year's Eve) he had to bat first even though his opening batsmen were known to be brittle. They survived into the third over when \"Davo\" Davidson (6/64) wrecked the innings with three wickets; Peter Richardson caught by Wally Grout for 3, Willie Watson undone by a yorker on his fourth ball and Tom Graveney for a golden duck by a brute of a ball that swung viciously and caught him leg before wicket. Peter May came in at 7/3 to survive the hat-trick and rebuild the innings, bringing up his first runs with a magnificent drive off Meckiff. Davidson bowled neatly and made the ball move, but \"Meckiff used the whole bowling crease, delivering balls from near the stumps and as wide as possible to the return crease\" and could find no swing. Fortunately for England Trevor Bailey was full of confidence and hit 6 fours in two and a half hours on his way to 48. Ken Mackay replaced Meckiff and almost had May caught in the slips, and Richie Benaud who replaced him missed a caught and bowled with his first delivery, but Davidson was kept on until lunch, when he was exhausted. They returned after lunch and the crowd saw the unprecedented sight of \"The Boil\" hitting Benaud for successive boundaries, but he was caught by the Australian captain off a slower ball from Meckiff, who had finally replaced Davidson and England were 92/4. Colin Cowdrey came in low at number 6 and stuck in for another do or die partnership with May, both playing disciplined innings with classical strokes. With Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill dominating the covers runs were hard to come by and they ended the day on 173/4. Benaud delayed asking for the new ball as his fast bowlers were tired and May and Cowdrey attacked the slow bowling, particularly that of Lindsay Kline. The captain reached his century by pulling Kline to the mid-wicket boundary and hitting the next ball with such power that Mackay, 50 yards away, did not have time to move before it flew past him for another four. It was the first Test hundred by an English captain in Australia since Archie MacLaren made 116 in the First Test at Sydney in 1901–02. The new ball was now taken with England 206/4 and Davidson and Meckiff returned to the attack, Meckiff (3/69) bowling May for 113 with an extra fast delivery that swung in and crashed into his stumps. Meckiff reckoned this to be the best ball he ever bowled \"the sun was shining, and May was batting beautifully at the time. Yet he explained it later that he had completed lost the ball from the instant it left the hand\". Godfrey Evans (4) could not cope with Meckiff's pace and Cowdrey (44) was caught by Grout off Davidson and England collapsed to 218/7. Jim Laker (dropped off his first ball) stayed in for over an hour making 22 not out, but Davidson bowled Brian Statham and Peter Loader and they were all out for 259.\nAustralia first innings.\nDespite the England collapse the pitch was losing its moisture and looked better for runs. Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey saw the day out with 96/1 for the loss of Jim Burke, bowled by Statham for 3 when he left the ball alone. Lacking the pace of the Australian bowlers Statham and Loader could not make the ball lift as they had done and Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker suffered as Harvey struck 10 fours in his 60 not out by the end of New Year's Day. They returned to the fray the following morning with May setting only one slip as he tried to stop the flow of runs, which saved Harvey when he edged to the vacant second slip on 67. Bailey bowled down the leg side with a leg field while Harvey watched the balls go by, but he and McDonald were able to run quickly between the wickets and keep the score ticking over, but only 39 runs were made off 18 eight–ball overs before lunch. Soon after the break Tom Graveney took a juggled catch at first slip off Statham to dismiss McDonald for 47 after four hours. Norm O'Neill came into a defensive field to Tony Lock bowling round the wicket and found it difficult to make runs, but tried one cracking drive that was stopped by the bowler and hurt his hand. Harvey tok 267 minutes to make his century, but there was a huge roar round the giant Melbourne Ground when he reached three figures. With his hundred up he attacked Laker and Lock, but with tight fields and accurate bowling he was unable to get away. The new ball was taken after tea and Statham had O'Neill (37) caught behind trying a powerful stroke off his back foot. Peter Loader, who had been plundered for 36 runs in 8 overs bowled Harvey (167) when he missed an on–drive. Considering the quality and the accuracy of the bowling Alec Bedser thought this was Harvey's best century and it was greatly appreciated by the 71,000 crowd. They could not have enjoyed what followed as Bobby Simpson and Richie Benaud went for ducks and Australia crashed from 255/2 to 262/6. Ken Mackay (18) and Alan Davidson (25) pulled the score to 282/6 by the end of the day, but Statham (7/57) had them out in the morning, then cleaned up tail for 308. He became only the sixth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105) and Frank Tyson (7/27). Once again Neil Harvey had scored over half the innings for Australia, but they were only 49 runs ahead.\nEngland second innings.\nI never saw anything so blatant as Meckiff's action as, with the swell of the crowd in his ears, he came up that afternoon full pelt from the bottom end towards the pavillion...the English press camp were outspoken to a degree and at least one Australian, Jack Fingleton, writing in the Sunday Times, thought Meckiff should have been called... England had a grievance, without a doubt.\nThe 49 run deficit was thought to be counterbalanced by the runs England could expect to get on a plumb wicket, but such hope were quickly dispelled. Richardson was out yet again trying to play the ball through the slips and being caught by Neil Harvey off Ian Meckiff. Willie Watson showed his lack of practice and was beaten by the pace of Alan Davidson. The 60,000 crowd were now strongly behind the Australian team and Tom Graveney's entry in the MCG was compared to the arrival of a Christian being fed to the lions in the Colosseum. He received a sharply rising ball from Ian Meckiff which was caught at full stretch by \"The Claw\" at short-fine-leg. Peter May joined Trevor Bailey, who was back to his usual stone-walling self and had stayed in for an almost an hour for 14 when he was finely caught by Jim Burke, also at short-fine leg, off a brute of a ball from Meckiff that rose high and hit his glove and bat-handle. Meckiff was bowling with far more accuracy than normal, but retained his fast pace and both he and Davidson bowled left-arm over the wicket, an unusual type of delivery that unsettled the England team. Benaud had also set a short-fine-leg with a short-leg behind him to catch the rising ball as the batsmen fended it off their body. Colin Cowdrey stayed in for 19 minutes before he played at a ball slanting wide across him and was caught by Wally Grout. Godfrey Evans went for a run which wasn't there and cracked his finger as his flung himself at the crease trying to make his ground. May, who had played a typically self-denying innings of 17 in 98 minutes when he was caught by Davidson off Meckiff, again the ball was angled awkwardly across his body. Now there was only the tail to dismiss and they fell quickly; Tony Lock caught and bowled by Davidson, Jim Laker caught by in the slips by Harvey off Davidson and Peter Loader bowled by Meckiff for a duck to leave England 87 all out. Ian Meckiff (6/38) took the best Test figures of his career, backed up by superlative catching from the Australian fielders and Davidson's 3/41.\nAustralia second innings.\nAustralia needed 42 to win and were 9/1 at stumps, with Colin McDonald lbw to Brian Statham (1/11). After the rest day nightwatchman Wally Grout was stumped by Evans off Jim Laker (1/7) despite the wicketkeeper's broken finger, but this was inadequate consolation for the easy Australian win as they made the 42/2 required.\nResult.\nAustralia won the Second Test by 8 wickets to take a 2–0 lead in the series. The English press thought England had been \"thrown out\", but there was no disguising that it was a dismal batting display from England on a good wicket. It was their worst score in Australia since Archie MacLaren's team were dismissed for 61 in 1901–02, ironically at Melbourne in the innings following the last time an England captain had made a century in Australia. Having not made an official complaint after the game against Victoria or the First Test at Brisbane the MCC were in no position to make an official complaint now Meckiff had won a Test. No umpire in Australia, South Africa or New Zealand had called him for throwing. He had even survived complaints by New South Wales when he was chosen for the 1957–58 tour ahead of one of their bowlers, he had been filmed and given the approval of the Australian Board of Control and had the support of his captain Richie Benaud. With no other game coming between the two Tests the teams proceeded to Sydney for the Third Test.\nThird Test – Sydney.\nA great effort would have been needed by the England batsmen to put them in a position beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. I thought he was so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.\nPreliminaries.\nEngland obviously needed to do something to maintain their hold on the Ashes and three changes were made to the team. The first was forced as Godfrey Evans had broken his middle finger and the reserve wicket-keeper Roy Swetman made his Test debut. This was not so much of a loss as first thought, Evans had not batted well for some years and Swetman had impressed behind the stumps throughout the tour and his batting had improved beyond all hopes. Peter Richardson had failed repeatedly as an opening batsman in the Tests and was replaced by his old opening partner Arthur Milton, even though he had broken his finger at Christmas. Willie Watson was dropped in favour of the newly arrived Cambridge and Sussex batsman Ted Dexter, who was also a more than useful swing bowler. May also had his final trump card, the fast bowler Fred Trueman, who had been ill at Brisbane and left out at Melbourne. He is widely considered to be England's greatest fast bowler and with good reason; he was the first man to take 300 wickets in Tests—307 at (21.57)—had tremendous stamina and bowled with a near perfect side on action that produced late swing at high pace. He was full of confidence and believed that he could get any batsman out on any wicket. Australia made changes as well, dropping Lindsay Kline who had taken 0/77 in two Tests and Bobby Simpson who had made a duck but was retained as twelfth man for his fielding. Instead they brought in the dual purpose fast-medium seamer and off-spinner Keith Slater, who had been twelfth man in the Second Test, but who had been accused of throwing by the MCC and Keith Miller. Mel McInnes kept his place as umpire even though Peter May and Freddie Brown had pointedly asked if it was necessary for him to officiate in all the Tests.\nEngland first innings.\nPeter May won the toss for the third time in a row and again decided to bat regardless of the ill-omens as the wicket looked easy going and was expected to take spin. Stonewaller Trevor Bailey who had been promoted in the batting order from 6 to 3, then 2 and was now asked to go in first with Arthur Milton. They were both out for 8 to Ian Meckiff and Alan Davidson and England were 23/2. Once again the England opening partnership had failed and Bailey, a considerable stumbling block for the bowlers down the order had been sacrificed at the top of the order. Tom Graveney (33) and Peter May (42) restored the innings as the fast bowlers found little swing, but Benaud kept them on for over an hour and May edged a ball past Neil Harvey at slip. With the shine taken off the new ball the pacemen were taken off and the spinners brought on, Richie Benaud getting turn almost at once and appealed for leg before wicket against May, but it was turned down. Keith Slater's first Test wicket was May after he had been hit for 4 and 2 and the captain looked in fine form, Slater getting the ball to hang back and it was hit where Benaud had placed Ken Mackay in the covers a few balls before, where he took a fine catch. Graveney edged Benaud just past Harvey which he managed to take for another stunning catch and Dexter was l.b.w. offering no stroke to Slater (2/40) and England were 98/5. The debutant Roy Swetman joined Colin Cowdrey to a great ovation from the 50,000 in the stands and survived a difficult catch to Harvey and another to Colin McDonald who had replaced \"The Claw\" at leg-slip, both chances off Benaud. The young wicket-keeper used his feet to go down the wicket, so when he padded up he could not given l.b.w., and began to make some runs with Cowdrey stroking the ball through the covers. After tea the vice-captain (34) gave Harvey another catch off Benaud, but Swetman and Tony Lock saw England safely to stumps with 190/6. The next day's start was delayed to past tea because of rain, made worse by the inadequate covering of the infield. When they finally resumed Benaud was spinning the ball more than ever and declined to take the new ball. Lock was out l.b.w. to Mackay, who ended Swetman's fine innings of 41 with another great catch off Benaud. Harvey also accounted for Jim Laker when he knocked the ball up into the air on the first attempt and ran five yards to catch it. Seeing the end was near Fred Trueman scattered the close fielders with a few powerful strokes and heaved the ball into the stands, but he was caught by Burke off Benaud to give the Australian captain 5/83 and England were out for 219. The first day was watched by John Mills and Trevor Howard, who were acting in Australia at the time. Howard compared the England collapse to the final act of the play he was in, saying \"\"Hamlet\" was never like this\".\nAustralia first innings.\nThere was time for three overs before the end of the day, but Roy Swetman dropped Colin McDonald in the first over and Fred Trueman was not best pleased, \"getting a wicket in my first over is always a great motivator, and seeing a decent chance put down annoyed me\". He bowled again on the Monday morning after a long dry Sunday and Jim Burke edged another chance off Trueman which a diving Swetman just reached, but he was unable to hold onto it. The Yorkshire fast bowler also got edges off Burke in the untenanted lep-slip area and McDonald just wide of the wicket-keeper. With the wicket made for spin and the pacemen getting nowhere May brought on Jim Laker (5/107) and Tony Lock (4/130). McDonald and Burke started walking down the pitch, sometimes even before Laker delivered the ball, but Burke edged a catch to Lock at short fine-leg to end their opening partnership on 26. Laker and Lock varied their bowling with flight and changes of pace and Lock moved from bowling round to over the wicket as when he saw that he could make the ball turn. Neil Harvey was worried by Laker using the rough and was with him stranded on a front foot stroke when a ball pitched middle-and-leg took out his off stump. McDonald was still moving down the wicket when he missed only for Swetamn to fumble the stumping. Norm O'Neill decided to drive firmly and one powerful stroke went past Tom Graveney just 10 yards away who got hand to the ball, but failed to take a difficult catch. None of these chances were easy, but Australia had been able to make then stick in the England innings and it would cost the tourists as O'Neill settled down to make 77. May switched the bowlers' ends using Statham, who O'Neill edged twice through vacant second slip to the boundary, but the change produced a wicket when Graveney dived forward to take McDonald off Lock. This brought the opener Les Favell to the crease at 87/3 and after surviving several loud l.b.w. appeals began to cut the spinners to the boundary and reached 50 before stumps in an unbeaten stand of 99. Laker's arthritic bowling finger hurt so much that he couldn't sleep, but after they brought up their century stand Australia was Lakered and Locked on the Tuesday morning, Cowdrey taking a catch off Lock for Favell and Swetman off Laker for O'Neill, Benaud was bowled by Laker trying to hit him out of the ground and they were 208/6. This brought \"Slasher\" Mackay and Alan Davidson together and England needed their wickets quickly to even the first innings score. Davdison repeatedly edged the ball just off his stumps and was lucky to survive, but May kept the spinners working for an hour after the new ball was due, but with no wickets forthcoming Trueman and Statham came back into the attack. There was little life in the pitch, Swetman taking the ball about his knees, and no or little swing. The heat in Sydney reached 100 °F/38 °C and Fred Trueman was sweltering in the outfield when a man on the Hill shouted \"Fred, you look in need of a beer, mate\" and gave him a can of Fosters to the delight of the crowd. When he returned after his next over he found twenty beer cans waiting in a line in front of the boundary fence. Davidson was playing a restrained innings instead of hitting the ball around the ground and Mackay foreswore his stonewalling to hit boundaries, so they ended up keeping pace with each other. May brought back his spinners and as the score passed 300/6 used Bailey for the first time, though like the others he found little swing. The seventh wicket finally came when Trueman (1/46) was back for a short spell when there were clouds about and bowled Mackay (57) with a swinging yorker on 323/7—a stand of 115. Davidson was in trouble for ten minutes, but finally went leg before to Lock for 71. With the last recognised batsman dismissed on 353/8 the innings was wrapped up for 357, a lead of 139.\nEngland second innings.\nThere was time for one over before the end of play and Bailey and Milton survived on 1/0. Richie Benaud set a very aggressive field, himself just three yards from Bailey, close enough to be hit by the bat, and was asked not to move as the Meckiff came in to bowl in case he distracted the batsman. Meckiff did not bowl for long as he bruised his Achilles tendon and retired from the field. Milton and Bailey held out for an hour and saw off the fast bowlers, before Milton edged a Benaud googly to Davidson and Bailey, after sweeping Slater to the boundary tried to sweep Benaud and was caught by Bobby Simpson, who had come on for Meckiff, and England were 37/2. Graveney was playing consistently into the twenties and thirties and was out for 22 when he missed a full toss from Davidson and was l.b.w. May had been playing and missing several times in a row going for shots and looked vulnerable, but at 64/3 he was joined by Cowdrey for another heroic partnership. Benaud was still crowding the batsmen with close fielders and Cowdrey began to stroke powerfully to drive them away. May called for a new bat and Peter Richardson brought out three; a barracker shouting \"Peter, you haven't got one there wide enough!\" The new bat appeared to solve his problems as May found his touch and they added 92 runs between lunch and tea. After tea they passed the deficit and Benaud became very defensive for the only prolonged period in the series, bowling ten overs of negative leg theory. Len Hutton thought Benaud was worried about being Lakered and Locked on the sixth and final day, but Bill O'Reilly called it \"tossing in the towel\". Benaud rested Davidson the next morning after he opened the bowling and gave him the new ball with Keith Slater bowling at fast-medium pace, but it barely swung or moved off the pitch and by lunch both batsmen were on 82 and the score 231/3. Slater looked outclassed in Test cricket and after lunch he was replaced by the part-time bowling of Jim Burke, and to everyone's surprise he bowled May for 92 with a faster ball after a partnership of 182. Ted Dexter came in, but Benaud returned to a more attacking mode and had him caught behind as he tried to play his strokes. Cowdrey now played out time as the next two batsmen fell cheaply, Swetman L.b.w. to Burke and Trueman stumped first ball off Benaud. After eighty minutes in the 90s Cowdrey reached his century, May declared on 287/7 and the game was saved.\nAustralia second innings.\nAustralia needed 151 runs in 100 minutes, but Benaud did not attempt it. Laker (2/10) was soon brought on and yorked Burke. May asked McDonald, who had pulled a hamstring when playing the MCC for the Australian XI, if he wanted to retire, but as he was walking off the pitch Benaud sent out a runner and insisted that he bat, but was bowled first ball. Harvey and O'Neill batted out time and Australia finished the game on 54/2\nResult.\nEngland and Australia drew the match. England were happy that they had saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin with any confidence. Trueman had bowled well without any luck and Laker and Lock had shown their spinning skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but said he had a job to do and 2–0 up was good for him and his team.\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\nRorke, who is six feet four inches, has a very short run which produces tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it was amazing to me that a bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, with a tremendous drag, and it means he delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.\nPreliminaries.\nThe Australians dropped Keith Slater and replaced him with the veteran fast bowler Ray Lindwall after an absence of 18 months. Although now 37 he had been training hard and had bowled well, having taken 7/73 against MCC. With 212 Test wickets Lindwall was the second greatest Australian wicket taker after Clarrie Grimmett (216) and he was determined to beat the record. Ian Meckiff had bruised his Achilles tendon at Sydney and was unfit to play, but any joy the England camp may have felt was reduced when they debuted the \"Blonde Giant\" Gordon Rorke after he had taken 6/58 against Queensland and 4/57 in the recent tour match. Incidentally, Rorke was the only Australian tailender as the other ten players were First Class cricket centurions. For England, Peter Richardson returned to open the batting with Trevor Bailey because Arthur Milton had re-fractured his broken finger and Raman Subba Row still had a damaged wrist. The alternative opener was Willie Watson—who replaced Ted Dexter—but he had made 141 batting at number 6 against Victoria and May wanted to keep him in the lower-middle order. Peter Loader had a groin strain that had kept him out of the New South Wales game, but the great shock was that the off-spinner Jim Laker, England's best bowler, could not play because his arthritic spinning finger was immobile. As a result, Frank Tyson was recalled after two years out of the team, having had taken 3/40 and 4/55 in the last two matches. Godfrey Evans replaced Roy Swetman as wicket-keeper even though his broken middle finger had not fully mended as the young Surrey keeper had proved fallible behind the stumps. As a result, May had four fast bowlers and only one spinner on a pitch that was traditionally a good batting surface with low bounce, though the South Australia game at Christmas had seen a green, pacey wicket. This was the only Test in which the three great England fast bowlers of the 1950s Tyson, Trueman and Statham all played together. Mel McInnes was umpire again, much to the annoyance of the England team as he had made mistakes in all his matches leading up to the Fourth Test. The 1956 Australians successfully asked for the great English umpire Frank Chester to be removed when an illness made his decisions erratic.\nAustralia first innings.\nMay won the toss for the fourth time in a row and felt obliged to bowl first so that his pacemen would get the benefit of any life there was in the pitch, but the wicket was brown and dry and full of runs. It was a gamble that relied on a quick breakthrough, though May may have been nervous about the effect of Ray Lindwall, Alan Davidson and Gordon Rorke on his fragile batting line up. Brian Statham got the first ball to nip back and almost hit McDonald's stump, and another went between Jim Burke's bat and pad only to miss off stump. Tyson bowled a good spell for no luck as did Trueman when he was brought back on and the batsmen played and missed throughout the day. Just before lunch Burke deflected a ball off his glove to first slip, where Evans dived out to catch it, but Umpire McInnes gave Burke (then on 24) not out. Burke fell later for 66, the only Australian wicket to fall on the first day, when he mis-cut a ball from Trevor Bailey to Colin Cowdrey in the gully. He had batted for over four hours in an opening partnership of 171 during which he made two boundaries. Neil Harvey came in and at the end of the day hit Tony Lock for a long straight six towards Adelaide Cathedral, the longest boundary in the world, and \"directed our eyes to the towers and pinnacles\". Harvey and McDonald saw stumps at 200/1 and carried their partnership to 268/1 when McDonald retired hurt after pulling a leg muscle. Harvey (41) was run out when he called for a second run and Brian Statham hitting the stumps. Statham (3/83) caused a small collapse to 294/4 (effectively 294/5) as he bowled Les Favell and had Ken Mackay caught by wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. McInnes took such a long time to give Ken Mackay out when he snicked the ball to Evans that in the end Mackay walked back to the pavilion, almost unheard of in Australia at the time and the crowd applauded his sportsmanship. Norm O'Neill (56) was playing well and one terrific pull smacked into the boundary fence before any fielder could move and added 75 with Richie Benaud who hit 7 fours in his 46, including a powerful hook off Trueman (4/90). The Yorkshireman never gave up and dismissed Benaud, Lindwall and Grout as the innings continued into the third day. McDonald returned at 407/7 with Burke as his runner and should have been run out when Trueman flattened the stumps when Burke ran round the back of McInnes and was out by yards. McInnes indicated that he was out then said not out as he could not see whether Burke had reached the crease in time. McDonald and Burke were walking to the pavilion when they were called back and McDonald was so annoyed that he told Fred to bowl straight and pulled away his bat to expose his stumps and gave the fast bowler \"the easiest Test wicket I have ever taken\". The Victorian opener had batted for seven hours and seven minutes for 170, his highest Test century and the highest score of the series. Alan Davidson hit 43 before he became the Tyson's only wicket, caught by Bailey two feet off the ground at short-leg, a poor reward for his untiring efforts with the ball and the outfield. Evans' unhealed finger broke again, but he continued to keep wicket on the second day and raised everybody's spirits with his chirpy optimism. He was replaced after the rest day by Tom Graveney, a part-time keeper for Gloucestershire who had played the part before at Old Trafford against South Africa in 1955. Australia's 476 was the highest innings of the series and virtually won the Ashes by protecting their 2–0 lead.\nEngland first innings.\nAt the end of the Australian innings the temperature dropped and a breeze came up which helped the Australian bowlers Alan Davidson and Ray Lindwall with their swing. Peter Richardson and Trevor Bailey were soon out and at 11/2 Peter May (37), promoted to number 3 to protect the other batsmen, and Colin Cowdrey (84) were back at the crease. They attacked the bowling with finely tuned strokes and with Graveney (41) took England to 170/3, May was bowled by Richie Benaud (5/91) when he tried to hit him for six. On the fourth day England collapsed to 188/9, Gordon Rorke (3/23) starting the rot by bowling Cowdrey, who edged the ball onto his stumps, and having Graveney caught by Benaud despite the ball coming off the bat at high speed. Tom Graveney recalled \"I had a personal experience of Richie's tactical genius...he held up play while he moved the short leg round a couple of yards. It interrupted my flow because I was forced to wonder why he had done it and whether I should be expecting a new direction from the bowler. This was exactly the reaction that Richie had wanted. There was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsman and reach their subconscious\" Benaud then dismissed Trueman, Lock, Tyson and Evans, two caught by Wally Grout, one by Burke and the other by the bowler himself. England were 89 runs short of saving the follow on, but Willie Watson and Brian Statham stayed at the crease for 70 minutes. Statham, who batted left-handed, hit 6 fours in a new highest Test score of 36 not out. Lindwall was given the new ball, but could only shave the stumps as Statham hit out. Davidson tripped in one of Trueman's foot marks and had to retire from the field. In the end Rorke bowled Watson to end the 52 run last wicket stand 37 runs short of their target. Rorke on debut returned figures of 18.1–7–23–3, his low economy due to his large number of almost wides and high pace and in one three over spell only one ball could have been played.\nEngland second innings.\nAs the teams returned up the pavilion steps Sir Donald Bradman called Richie Benaud to one side and reminded him that England's only chance of retaining the Ashes was it they were forced to follow on and made a lot of runs. Benaud agreed with him, but excused himself as he had to go and tell Peter May that he was going to bat again. When he reached the dressing room he consoled May with what Sir Donald had said. This was repeated by cricket commentators when a Test side in this situation must win, notably when Allan Border's Australians followed on at The Oval in 1985. Watson (40) returned with Richardson (43) and together they saw off the new ball to end the day on 43/0, and produced the highest England opening stand of the series, staying for almost three hours and adding 89. Davidson could not bowl after his injury, Rorke opened the bowling with Lindwall and Benaud had to bowl himself for a spell of four hours. The partnership ended when Watson pulled a full toss from the captain and Les Favell ran in to take the catch on the boundary. Richardson fell to Benaud (4/84) padding up against a ball that didn't move having survived a l.b.w. appeal the ball before. May (59) and Graveney looked set for big scores, and the England captain struck Benaud for three successive fours before he was leg before by a torpedo from Rorke (2/78). Bailey was caught by Grout off Lindwall (2/70) on the last ball of the day, though he and Graveney thought the ball had come off the top of his pad. At 198/5 England's cause looked lost and Graveney could only look on as the lower order collapsed before him. Lock (9) stayed in for an hour as did Tyson, who made 33 in a stand of 46, but the other three tailenders only lasted 20 minutes and Graveney ended with 53 not out, having batted for over five hours. England's total of 270 put them only 34 runs ahead.\nAustralia second innings.\nLes Favell came into open the innings and hit the winning runs on his home ground as he and Burke made the 36/0 required.\nResult.\nAustralia won the Test by 10 wickets, the series 3–0 and regained the Ashes lost in 1953.\nCongratulations to Australia, they were the better team...I felt that with Laker not fit we had to gamble on the first morning. I thought this was the best way to win the match, but it did not come off. Richie Benaud has a fine team; he inspired them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\nAnd so Australia won the match by a very convincing margin of nine wickets and put the finishing touches to the biggest defeat England had suffered in a Test series for some time. It was the first time in forty-seven years that the captain on winning the toss had sent in the opposition and won a Test match in the England–Australia series. Australia had England on the run from the moment Benaud maintained an aggressive approach to the game, as well he might, being so much on top during the series.\nPreliminaries.\nIn the 1950–51 Ashes series the MCC tour manager Freddie Brown arrived at Melbourne for the Fifth and final Test having lost the series 4–0, but won the match and won a great ovation from the Australian crowd who admired his fighting spirit throughout the series. He now arrived with Peter May's team hoping to do the same and the players were keen to salvage something from the tour. Arthur Milton was sent home with his broken finger, Brian Statham and Peter Loader had been injured in a car accident when their tyre blew, Godfrey Evans was still recovering from his broken finger and Willie Watson suffered a groin strain bowling in the nets. This reduced the touring team to 13 fit players, but Jim Laker was ready to play and returned to the team with Ted Dexter and Roy Swetman. Tony Lock's 5 wickets had cost 75.20 and was dropped in favour of debutant off-spinner John Mortimore. This was a surprise for the Australians, but even more so to Lock, who heard the news on the radio. The home team dropped batsman Les Favell in favour of the fast bowler Ian Meckiff whose bruised foot had healed. Mel McInnes was replaced as umpire by Les Townsend in his only Test as umpire.\nEngland first innings.\nFor the first time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, swinging conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourite deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; \"I remember him getting me out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal\". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.\nAustralia first innings.\nThe pitch still had some life when Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson opened the bowling, and Trueman was able to swing the ball. When Colin McDonald was on 12 he found one of his bails had fallen off his stumps, but an appeal for hit wicket was disallowed, though McDonald later thought that he must have hit the stumps when starting for a run. He also gave a catch to John Mortimore at short-leg, but the fieldman slipped on the wet ground and missed it. Jim Burke showed a marked dislike to the short-pitched bowling and both bowlers exploited this until he lobbed a catch to Trueman off a Tyson bouncer. Jim Laker had a temperature and sore throat, but came on to bowl with Mortimore, but neither off-spinner could get the ball to turn like Benaud's wrist spin, which usually had an advantage in Australia. McDonald was now comfortable and was using his favourite cut stroke to make runs, but Neil Harvey was not comfortable against the faster bowling and Trueman had him caught by Roy Swetman off a beautiful out-swinger. Norm O'Neill came in to bat and on \"a good day for batting and with an appreciative crowd in attendance I felt like a million\", but was caught by Colin Cowdrey in the gully off Fred Trueman for a first ball duck. Four years later in the Second Test on the same ground he was dismissed in exactly the same manner for another first ball duck. This left Australia 83/3, but McDonald (133) added 71 with Ken Mackay (23) and 53 with Alan Davidson (17), who was bowled for Mortimore's first Test wicket. McDonald fell to Laker (4/92) at 209/6 and England were still in the game. \"Slasher\" Mackay batted for two hours to reach 22 and was given a slow hand clap by the impatient crowd of 50,000. Richie Benaud (64) and Wally Grout (74, his highest Test score) hastened the scoring rate, made 115 and for the only time in the series a hundred runs was made in a session as they hooked away at the bowlers feeding them short balls. Laker got them both out in the end and Trueman was given the new ball as Ray Lindwall came to the crease. In 1953 Lindwall had hit Trueman with a wicked bouncer that \"hit me so hard in the shoulder blade that I thought someone had stuck a carving knife in it\". Trueman had sworn revenge, but had had to wait for five years. He got Lindwall out with a ball that ricocheted off his bat handle onto his forehead into the hands of Colin Cowdrey at slip. The Yorkshireman caught and bowled Meckiff and Swetman caught Benaud off Laker to finish the innings on 351, 146 runs ahead.\nEngland second innings.\nBenaud gave a suitably motivated Lindwall the new ball and he bowled as well as he ever had, making the ball swing more than the Englishmen and bowling Trevor Bailey for a duck to record his record 217th Test wicket, the same batsman who had given him his 100th Ashes Test wicket four years before. Peter May received a torrid over, playing and missing several times in a row before he edged the ball though the slips and then to Neil Harvey. Lindall (3/37) was given a standing ovation as he left the field on the third day with England 22/2. He chased down Trueman to complain about the bouncer who told him \"I'd played bugger all in the way of cricket in that summer of '53, when I came up against you at the Oval. You bowled me a bouncer then, but I didn't squeal or moan about it\". Lindwall said \"Christ! You still remember that?...I made a promise to myself to buy you a beer after that Test but never got round to it. What says you keep me to that promise now?\" and they went to the bar. Peter Richardson (23) held off the bowlers for over two hours and put on 66 with Colin Cowdrey who looked in fine form with seven boundaries in his 44. He was run out when he trotted in for a single, even though the umpire was unsighted by the wicket-keeper Wally Grout. Cowdrey took strike again unaware of his dismissal until he was asked to depart. Richie Benaud had strained a muscle batting and Ian Meckiff damaged his Achilles tendon again so the bulk of the bowling fell to Alan Davidson (2/95). Tom Graveney made 54 and looked as good as ever, but he only got support from Trueman who tried to hit every ball and either pulled off a perfect stroke or missed completely in an entertaining 36. The young Gordon Rorke (3/41) took the last three wickets and England were out for 214.\nAustralia second innings.\nColin McDonald made most of the opportunity to make more runs with an unbeaten 51 out of 69/1, but Jim Burke was given a barrage of short balls until his missed a shooter from Frank Tyson (1/20) and was out l.b.w. for 13.\nResult.\nAustralia won by 9 wickets to complete a 4–0 series win. It was the first time that a captain had put the opposition in to bat and won in an Ashes Test since Johnny Douglas in the Fourth Test on the same Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 1911–12 Ashes series.\nSeries averages.\nAs was the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if used at all. The Australians were all amateurs until the Packer Revolution, even though they played like professionals.\nPress corps.\nThe English press corps sent to cover the Ashes was larger than the MCC touring team, which excited comment at the time. Even as late as 1932–33 the newspapers had sent two men to cover the series: a ghost-writer for Jack Hobbs and a tennis correspondent. The 1958–59 corps formed a considerable body of cricket knowledge; L. N. Bailey, Alex Bannister, Alec Bedser, Bill Bowes, Charles Bray, Brian Chapman, John Clarke, Charles Fortune, Harry Gee, John Kay, Ian Peebles, R. A. Roberts, Frank Rostron, Denys Rowbotham, E. W. Swanton, Johnny Wardle (who had been selected for the tour until sacked by Yorkshire), Crawford White, and John Woodcock.\nRadio serial.\nThe ABC produced a radio serial to coincide with the series \"LBW Smith\" which used the Ashes as a backdrop."

For this classification, points are given to the cyclists who cross the mountain peaks first. The classification was established in 1935, when it was won by Italian Edoardo Molinar, and until 2005 the leader in the mountain classification wore a green jersey. In 2006, it became an orange jersey, and in 2010 it became white with blue dots.\nSpaniard José Luis Laguía has won this classification a record five times, including three consecutive. Other cyclists who have won this ranking for three consecutive times were Antonio Karmany, Julio Jiménez, José María Jiménez, all Spaniards. Overall, the Spaniards have dominated this classification by 47 out of 68 times.\nIn 2010, David Moncoutié considered retirement, but remained a professional cyclist to try to win his third consecutive mountains classification. In 2011, he became the first rider ever to win this award in four consecutive years.\nJersey.\nAs of 2010, the leader of the mountains classification is awarded a white jersey with blue dots.\nThe mountains jersey is third in the rankings of jerseys, behind the jersey for the general classification and points classification in the Vuelta a España but before the combination classification; this means that if a cyclists leads both the general classification and the mountains classification, he wears the jersey for the general classification, and the mountains jersey is passed on to the second cyclist in that ranking.\nRules.\nThe organisation of the Vuelta designates which climbs are given points, and in which category they fall. As of 2010, there are 5 categories: most points are scored on the Top Alberto Fernández, the highest point of the Vuelta.\nIf two or more cyclists have the same number of points, the cyclist who was first on the 'Top Alberto Fernandez' gets the higher ranking. If that does not solve the problem, the cyclists with the most high climb finishes wins gets the higher ranking. If that does not solve it, the cyclists with the most first category wins, and so on. If after the third category there is still a tie, the order in the general classification is used."

The team was owned and operated by Maple Leaf Gardens Limited, and served as a farm team for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nPrior to launching the Tigers, the Leafs were affiliated with the New Brunswick Hawks of the American Hockey League (AHL), which they shared with the Chicago Black Hawks. However, Harold Ballard, owner of the Leafs, decided that they needed a developmental team of their own, with a spokesperson citing the limited number of roster spots as the rationale for the move.\nThe team averaged only 1,500 fans and lost $750,000 in their first season, leading the Leafs to dissolve the Tigers in the spring of 1982. Shortly thereafter, with Chicago having pulled out of New Brunswick in favour of affiliating with the Springfield Indians on their own, the Leafs relocated the New Brunswick Hawks to St. Catharines, Ontario to establish the St. Catharines Saints as their farm team."

        "text": "John George Schneider (February 15, 1894 – May 13, 1957) was a professional American football player in the \"Ohio League\" and the early National Football League (NFL) for the Columbus Panhandles. He played from around 1909 until 1921 with the Panhandles. In 1920 he played in one of the first NFL games during a Panhandles 14-0 loss to the Dayton Triangles.\nHe was a teammate of the Panhandles' infamous Nesser Brothers and later married their sister Mary Rose. However, on one occasion John did not play for Columbus. According to his daughter, Cassidy, the Panhandles sometimes would go to different places and the opposing team would not have enough players. To keep the game scheduled, the opposing team would take somebody from the Panhandles. They were never allowed to take one of the Nesser brothers. During one such game, John, was picked to play against his own team and the Nessers. 'I was the poor fool who got picked to play against the Nessers, and they pulverized me.' He used to say, 'I think that was my scariest day, other than the day I asked the brothers if I could marry their sister.'"

Selected athletes have achieved one of the competition's qualifying standards. Blanka Vlašić defended her high jump world title.\nTeam selection.\nCroatian team at the 2009 World Championships was selected by Siniša Ergotić, director of the Croatian Athletics Federation. Two out of five athletes qualified by meeting the A standard: Blanka Vlašić and Sandra Perković. Except for Sandra Perković, all athletes in the Croatian team had prior experience from major athletics competitions (European Championships, World Championships, or Olympic Games).\nJurica Grabušić also qualified by meeting the 110 meter hurdles B standard, but decided against competing after consultations with his coach.\nResults.\nMen.\nNedžad Mulabegović fell short of his season's best of 20.08 m by approximately one meter, and did not advance to the shot put final.\nAndrás Haklits advanced to the hammer throw final by improving on his season's best of 76.28 m. His best throw in the final was only slightly shorter, which was good enough for 7th place, and the greatest success of his career.\nWomen.\nBlanka Vlašić came to the World Championships with a season's best of 2.05 m, edged by world leading 2.06 m set by her main rival and home crowd favorite Ariane Friedrich, who had beaten Vlašić at the European Athletics Indoor Championships earlier that year.\nDespite a warmup accident on the morning of high jump qualification, when Vlašić hit her head on the door frame and sustained a head injury that required stitches, she made the qualifying height without problems.\nIn the high jump final, Vlašić was one of three athletes to clear 2.02 m, and the only athlete to clear 2.04 m, pushing Chicherova and Friedrich to second and third respectively, and thus successfully defending her world title. She celebrated the victory in an emotional way, saying later that winning the gold medal was \"one of the hardest things I have done in my career\", and was \"not comparable with Osaka\".\nSandra Perković was, at age 19, the youngest discus thrower at the championships, including the qualifiers. Less than a month prior, she had won a gold medal at the 2009 European Athletics Junior Championships with a throw of 62.44 m, meeting the A standard, and breaking the national record held by her national team colleague Vera Begić. In Berlin, Perković made the final with a 62.16 m qualifying mark. In the final, she made only one legal throw of 60.77 m out of three attempts, and finished 9th.\nVera Begić's qualifying discus throw of 58.25 m was well short of her personal and season's best of 61.52 m, and was only good enough for 24th place."

        "title": "List of South Africa national rugby union players",
        "text": "South Africa national rugby union team players hold several international records. Several players from the South Africa national rugby union team have joined the IRB and International Hall of Fame.\nIndividual records.\nCareer.\nSouth Africa's \"most capped player\" is Victor Matfield with 127 caps. Matfield was the \"most-capped lock for any nation\" in rugby history, with all of his 127 appearances at that position in 2011, this record has now been overtaken by Alun Wyn Jones. The \"most-capped back\" is Bryan Habana, with 124 caps over a thirteen year career. Percy Montgomery holds the South African record for \"Test points\" with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands eleventh).(as at 10 December 2019)\nMorné Steyn holds the Springbok record for the \"fastest 100 points\" (8 Test matches)\nAlthough statistics on the success rate of kicks at goal were not kept until the late 1980s, it is believed that Steyn also holds the record for \"most consecutive successful kicks at goal in Tests\". He had a streak of 41 successful kicks at goal, which started during the Boks' Test against Italy on 19 June 2010 and ended on 6 November 2010 against Ireland.\nJohn Smit was the \"world's most-capped captain\", having captained South Africa in 82 of his 111 Tests. He has since been overtaken by Richie McCaw and Brian O'Driscoll. The \"world's most-capped lock pairing\" is that of Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, who have started together in 62 Tests. Smit also played 46 \"consecutive matches\" for South Africa, which is a record.\nThe record \"try scorer\" is Bryan Habana with 67 international tries.(as at 14 February 2018)\nSingle match.\nFly-half Jannie de Beer holds the \"world record for dropped goals in a Test match\" (5, during the 44–21 quarter-final win over England in the 1999 Rugby World Cup)\nThe \"most points\" Montgomery ever scored in a \"single international\" was 35 against Namibia in 2007—this is also a South African record.\nOn 1 August during the 2009 Tri Nations tournament, Morné Steyn set a number of records during the second Test between the Springboks and the All Blacks. The Springboks won 31–19, with Steyn scoring all South Africa's points – 1 try, 1 conversion, 8 penalties. This gave him records for:\nHall of Fame players.\nEleven former South African international players have been inducted into either the International Rugby Hall of Fame or the IRB Hall of Fame. Six are members of the International Rugby Hall of Fame only; two are members of the IRB Hall of Fame only, and four are members of both Halls of Fame.\nBarry \"Fairy\" Heatlie, who played in the late 19th century and into the early 20th, was one of the early greats of South African rugby. He appeared for Western Province 34 times between 1890 and 1904, with 28 of them being Currie Cup wins. He also played six Tests for South Africa against the Lions in 1891, 1896, and 1903, and also captained the side to their only two Test wins of the 1890s. Arguably his greatest legacy to South African rugby is the green jersey; he is credited with introducing the colour for South Africa's 1903 Test against the Lions at Newlands. He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.\nBennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933. Playing at fly-half, his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924. He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 1931–32 when they defeated all four Home Nations. His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933. Osler was inducted to the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.\nMaking his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was scrum-half Danie Craven. Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half, centre and even number-eight. However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass. As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first series victory over New Zealand. His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions. Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 4–0 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949. He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991. Craven was instrumental in the formation of the South African Rugby Union and became its first Executive President. Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as \"Mr Rugby\", was inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1997, and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2007; behind Rugby School and William Webb Ellis.\nThe man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was Hennie Muller, inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 2001. He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 4–0 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland. He was nicknamed \"Windhond\" (greyhound) for his speed around the field. When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: \"(Okey) Geffin won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible.\" Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost one—against Australia in 1953.\nNamed South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000, Frik du Preez played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971. Du Preez could play both flanker or lock and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, but was especially well known for his all round skills. Danie Craven said of du Preez, \"To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance.\" He was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.\nMorne du Plessis played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980. His debut was at Number 8 in South Africa's series win over Australia in 1971. He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africa—his father had captained South Africa in 1949. He led South Africa to a 3–1 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British and Irish Lions in 1980 by the same margin. Du Plessis would be inducted into the International Hall of Fame in 1999.\nInternational Hall of Fame inductees Naas Botha, inducted in 2005, and Danie Gerber, inducted in 2007, both had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s. Botha made his Test debut against the South American Jaguars in 1980. Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992. Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at Twickenham. Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992. He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986. In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice.\nTwo players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were Francois Pienaar and Joost van der Westhuizen. Both first played for the Springboks in 1993. Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup. It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from Nelson Mandela who was wearing his number 6 jersey. Nelson Mandela later wrote \"It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire country. Francois brought the nation together.\" Pienaar entered the International Hall of Fame in 2005, and was inducted into the IRB Hall in 2011 alongside all other World Cup-winning captains from the inaugural event in 1987 through 2007 (minus the previously inducted Australian John Eales). Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups. Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries. At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player. He entered the International Hall of Fame two years after Pienaar, in 2007.\nThe newest Springbok players to enter the IRB Hall of Fame are John Smit, inducted in 2011 alongside Pienaar, and Bryan Habana, who received this honor for his remarkable contributions to South African rugby. Habana's induction into the Hall of Fame was officially recognized by World Rugby, as announced in a press release on the Rugby World Cup website. Habana, renowned for his outstanding achievements on the international stage, became the second Springbok to receive the World Rugby Player of the Year award after Schalk Burger in 2004. His induction into the Hall of Fame acknowledges his exceptional career, which included becoming the Springboks' all-time leading try-scorer and drawing level with Jonah Lomu as the men's Rugby World Cup all-time leading try scorer.\nList.\nAs at 29 October 2023, 933 South African rugby union players have represented the Springboks, either by playing in a test match or touring with the national side.\nPlayers included in the current squad as of 29 October 2023 are indicated in green."

On 13 October, he played for New Zealand against Australia in the trans-Tasman test.\n2013.\nOn 7 March, Taylor announced that he signed a 4-year deal with the Penrith Panthers, starting from 2014, joining former Warriors' coach Ivan Cleary. Penrith Manager Phil Gould said he had, \"been specifically targeted by the club, not only for his elite footballing talent, but also based on his tremendous character and leadership qualities.\" \nOn 19 April, he played in the 2013 Anzac Test, playing off the interchange bench in the 32–12 loss. Taylor finished his last year with the Warriors with 8 tries from 23 matches. \nAt the end of the year, he was selected in the New Zealand 2013 Rugby League World Cup squad, scoring his first international try in the 56–10 victory over Papua New Guinea at Headingley Stadium.

I have thoughts of doing it again and the thought of six months of rehab again is scary, they're bad thoughts, and I won't lie they are always there in the back of my mind,\" he said.\nIn Round 20 against the Canberra Raiders, Taylor played his 100th career match and also scored a try in the Panthers 34–24 loss at Penrith Stadium. In Round 24 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Taylor's season was ended due to a hand injury. Taylor finished the 2015 NRL season with 20 matches and a try. On 8 September, he was named in the New Zealand train-on squad for the end of year tour of Great Britain, but didn't make the final squad.\n2016.\nConsidered a potential captain for Panthers in 2016, Taylor was dropped to the NSW Cup team by new coach Anthony Griffin in favour of rookie James Fisher-Harris. On 2 May, Taylor joined the Wests Tigers effective immediately, after being released from his Panthers contract. Taylor played in 2 matches for the Panthers in 2016 before the shift to the Tigers. Taylor said, \"They wanted me to be more aggressive in defence. That's what I was working on. I'm not the one to go out and put on a big shot or whack someone in a tackle. My strength is to consistently be there, wrestle and lead the line speed. But I realised I wasn't going to play first grade even though I thought I had done everything that was asked of me. I was a bit frustrated, but I'm not a person to get angry. I just wanted to play first grade again, so that's why I'm at the Tigers.\"\nIn Round 10, Taylor made his club debut for the Wests Tigers against Canterbury-Bankstown, starting at second-row in the 36–4 loss at ANZ Stadium. In his next game, he was named Man of the Match. With part of the game spent playing hooker after an injury to Matt Ballin, He made 50 tackles and set up 2 tries. Captain Aaron Woods said, \"He's been really good for our defensive line as well. Just the amount of talk he brings. He's a player I'm really glad we picked him up.\" In the next game against the Brisbane Broncos , Taylor scored his first try for the Wests Tigers in the 19–18 victory and was named the Man of the Match for the second week in a row.\nOn 21 November, Taylor re-signed with the Wests Tigers on a one-year deal with a second year option in his favour, that would see him at the club until 2018.\n2017.\nTaking the responsibility of vice-captain, Taylor was a regular in first grade in 2017, with 5 tries from 21 games.

He was awarded the Kelly-Barnes Medal for the Wests Tigers player of the year.\nAt season's end, Taylor renewed his contract to remain at the club to the end of 2020. He said, \"Ivan coming in as head coach was a big factor in me deciding to stay. He's an experienced coach and has coached me at both the Warriors and Penrith, he's the reason I moved to Australia, knowing what kind of coach he is, what his principles are and the way he likes to play football was probably the biggest factor.\"\n2018.\nAfter the departure of Aaron Woods, Taylor was named as one of 5 co-captains at Wests Tigers, alongside Benji Marshall, Chris Lawrence, Russell Packer and Josh Reynolds. Coach Ivan Cleary said, \"I just think it's the right model for us right now. When we started this preseason it was pretty obvious straight away that there was no real pecking order. There was no set culture to adhere to. It was all new.\"\n2020.\nOn 28 September 2020, Taylor was one of eight players who were released by the Wests Tigers.\nOn 28 December 2020, Taylor signed for English Super League team Salford on a two-year deal, he linked up with former team mates Tui Lolohea, Krisnan Inu &amp; Sebastine Ikahihifo.\n2021 &amp; 2022.\nIn the 2021 Super League season, Taylor made 14 appearances for Salford as the club finished 11th on the table.

        "title": "1954–55 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1954–55 Ashes series consisted of five cricket Test matches, each of six days with five hours play each day and eight ball overs. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1954–55 and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. The England team was captained by Len Hutton, the first professional cricketer to lead an MCC tour of Australia. The Australian team under Ian Johnson was confident of victory, but despite losing the First Test by an innings England won the series 3–1 and retained the Ashes. They were the only touring team to win a series in Australia between 1932–33 and 1970–71 and only the second of three touring teams to win a series in Australia from behind (the other two being England in 1911–12 and the West Indies in 1992–93). The tour is best remembered for the bowling of Frank \"Typhoon\" Tyson, who was at the time regarded as the fastest, most frightening bowler ever seen in Australia. The series saw a phenomenal concentration of bowling prowess on both sides – four of the bowlers had career Test averages under 21, another five under 25 and the remaining four under 30. Unsurprisingly therefore, the ball dominated the bat for most of the series and each side only topped 300 in an innings twice. Unlike the following series in 1958–59 there were rarely any umpiring disputes and Keith Miller wrote \"Mel McInnes, Colin Hoy and Ron Wright were our leading umpires in the 1954–55 M.C.C. tour of Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that McInnes gave the finest exhibition of umpiring in a Test series that I have experienced\".\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\nPreliminaries.\nThe England spinners had been out of form in the last few games, so the tour selectors (Geoffrey Howard, Len Hutton, Peter May, Bill Edrich and Godfrey Evans) chose four pace bowlers and Hutton was committed to bowling first, though this appears to have been his intention since the start of the tour. He was only the second England captain to play a Test match without a spinner, the only other example being Douglas Jardine in the Second Test at Melbourne in 1932–33, which he lost by 111 runs. Wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans missed the Test because of heat-stroke and was replaced by debutant Keith Andrew. Colin Cowdrey, who had made 110 and 103 in the New South Wales match, and Les Favell, who had opened with 84 and 47 for South Australia against the tourists, also made their debuts. Reg Simpson opened with Hutton after his century against Queensland, but the out of form Bill Edrich had to come in at number 3. There were worries about Ray Lindwall's gastric problems, and Alec Bedser's undiagnosed rash, but in the end both were deemed fit to play. Remembering Bedser's hold over the Australian batsmen and that England still held the Ashes the Australian bookies gave the two sides even odds.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nLen Hutton had lost the toss five times in a row in 1953, but this time he won it and he became the first England captain to put Australia in to bat since 1911–12. He then watched his fielders drop 14 catches as Australia piled up 601/8 declared. Keith Andrew dropped Arthur Morris off Bedser on 0, allowing the Australian opener to make 153, adding 202 in 232 minutes for the third wicket with Neil Harvey (162). Alec Bedser had a rash all over his back, but bowled on regardless for 1/131 as another six catches were dropped off his bowling. His ungainly fielding led to him being barracked by the crowd, calling \"Old Man\" whenever he stopped the ball. Tyson – labouring under a 38-yard run up – went for 1/160 off 29 eight ball overs, but battered the batsmen with bouncers and bruised Morris on the arm several times. He also bowled short and fast at Ray Lindwall after the all-rounder had despatched him to the boundary on his way to 64 not out, which would have serious repercussions in the Second Test at Sydney. \"We dropped a considerable number of catches,\" recalled wicket-keeper Keith Andrew. \"Nether were we the fittest team in the world. Compton broke a finger fielding on the first day and Alec Bedser was never well, as was proved when it was discovered that he had developed shingles. One or two of us also got a touch of the sun, but there was no way of getting away from the fact that 'catches win matches'.\"\nEngland – First Innings.\nWhen they finally got to bat on the third day England quickly collapsed to 25/4, but then debutant Colin Cowdrey made 40, adding 72 for the 5th wicket with Trevor Bailey who ground out 88 over 283 minutes. With the \"Barnacle\" immobile at one end – he took 160 minutes to reach 38 – the Australian bowlers worked their way through the tail until Denis Compton, who had broken the metacarpal bone in his hand on the boundary fence, came at number 11. Before the match a local businessman had promised £100 to the first English batsman to hit a six. Realising that the innings was soon to close, the stonewaller extraordinaire Trevor Bailey hit Ian Johnson into the stands for the prize. The wickets were shared among the Australian bowlers: Ray Lindwall was the best with 3/27 and Ian Johnson took 3/46.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nForced to follow on 411 runs behind England did better in the second innings, losing only two early wickets instead of four. Bill Edrich made a battling 88 and put on 124 for the 3rd wicket with Peter May (44), but when Bailey was out for 23 the tail collapsed from 220/5 to 257 all out despite Tyson making his highest Test score of 37 not out. The wickets were again distributed amongst the bowlers with Richie Benaud taking 3/43.\nResult.\nAustralia won by an innings and 154 runs to take a 1–0 lead in the series. The papers unanimously criticised Hutton's decision to send Australia in to bat, though they noted he would have done better if England had held onto its chances in the field. John Arlott wrote that neither Len Hutton or Alec Bedser had produced a \"larger than life\" performance to rescue England. Only once before had a team come from behind to win in Australia, in 1911–12 when the great Sydney Barnes had rescued the side after his captain's mistakes in the First Test. Ian Johnson had more than confirmed his place as Australian captain, even though it was \"only\" the biggest Australian victory over England since they won by an innings and 332 runs in the First Test on the same ground in 1946–47.\nSecond Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nIn the Second Test Keith Andrew, Reg Simpson and Alec Bedser were unceremoniously dumped from the England team, which they discovered when they saw the batting line up posted in the dressing room. Andrews was not surprised as Godfrey Evans was fit again and it annoyed Simpson, but devastated Bedser, the bedrock of England's bowling attack since the war. Instead the spinners Bob Appleyard and Johnny Wardle were brought into the bowling attack and Tom Graveney stood in for the injured Denis Compton. Australia were not without their troubles, both captain Ian Johnson and his rival Keith Miller were unfit to play so batsman Jim Burke and all-rounder Alan Davidson of New South Wales were brought in as replacements and vice-captain Arthur Morris took command, with Richie Benaud as his vice-captain despite his lack of form and seniority. One piece of good news for the England team was the arrival of Henry Sayen, a rich American industrialist and cricket fan who was seen as a lucky mascot. He gave financial bonuses to England players for outstanding play and had watched them play Australia in 1953 and the West Indies in 1953–54, when England fought their way out of almost certain defeat. Despite a recent operation and the advice of his doctors he travelled across the world to see England play and dined with the MCC team, Ian Johnson, Sir Donald Bradman and Prime Minister Robert Menzies.\nEngland – First Innings.\nMorris won the toss and like Hutton at Brisbane put the opposition in, but this time on a fast, green wicket. Here the similarity ended as the Australian bowlers turned up trumps, helped by some superb fielding. Trevor Bailey, acting as makeshift opener, was out for a duck (after 37 minutes) and wickets continued to fall at regular intervals, Ron Archer (3/12) and Bill Johnston (3/56) took most of the wickets and \"The Claw\" accounted for Hutton's demise. Only Johnny Wardle's top scoring 35 – adding 43 for the last wicket with Brian Statham – managed to pull England up to 154.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nAustralia replied with 228, the top nine batsmen getting into double figures, but no one reached 50, Ron Archer equalling his best Test score of 49 and Jim Burke making 44. Bailey opened the bowling as well as the batting and took 4/59, but the talking point was Frank Tyson. With his \"short\" run up of 18–20 yards Tyson took 4/45, described vividly by Margaret Hughes \"Harvey received a beast of a ball from Tyson which spat up at him and splashed off his bat to Cowdrey\". Ray Lindwall had bowled Tyson for a duck in the England first innings and was bounced again by the England fast bowler.\nEngland – Second Innings.\n\"He let me have a very fast, short-pitched delivery...Instinctively I turned a defensive back on the ball which skidded through and hit me a sickening blow on the back of my head. I sank to the ground and as I slipped in and out of consciousness, I was dimly aware of the players gathering round my prostrate body. Indistinctly I heard my fellow batsman Bill Edrich saying: 'My God, Lindy, you've killed him!'...I was very, very angry with Ray Lindwall. And the whole of the Aussie team knew it...I would return the bouncer with interest!\". Picture\nWith Australia 74 runs ahead runs were imperative for England, but they fell to 55/3 before Peter May (104) and Colin Cowdrey (54) came together and made a disciplined stand of 116 \"every run a precious inch of ground won back at a moment when the Ashes seemed to have receded almost out of sight...the recovery was shaped by batsmanship of a classic method executed by two young men\". May added another 51 with Bill Edrich before being bowled by Lindwall. Strangely, Tyson had been put in to bat at number 7 above Test centurion Godfrey Evans. Lindwall boasted that he never bowled short at tailenders (which didn't bother Tyson), but someone coming to bat at number 7 can be regarded as an all-rounder and the Australian fast bowler made the greatest mistake of his career, he bounced Tyson, who caught the ball on the back of his head and collapsed at the wicket. The Australians anxiously gathered around, players did not wear protective helmets in the 1950s and he had to be helped off the field and taken to hospital for x-rays. He returned to bat sporting a bump on his head that could be seen from the stands, was cheered by the crowd, and made another 8 runs before being bowled by Lindwall. England crashed from 222/4 to 250/9 and once again it was up to the last wicket pair – this time Appleyard (19 not out) and Statham (25) – to add 46 vital runs, taking the score to 296. The strength of the Australian bowling attack prevented any one man taking the lion's share, Archer (3/53), Lindall (3/69) and Bill Johnston (3/70) sharing the wickets between them.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nAustralia needed 223 runs to win in over four sessions, which was regarded as not too difficult a task, especially if Frank Tyson was affected by his injury, but instead he was very angry and ready to exact revenge. The Australians were afraid that he would send down a barrage of fast, short-pitched bowling, but Tyson was intelligent enough to bowl full length deliveries that caught them unprepared. Brian Statham bowled the first over from the Paddington End, \"up the cellar steps\". into a \"half a gale\", while Tyson tore down the slope from the Randwick End and with the wind behind him and bowled \"as fast as man has ever bowled\". Statham showed why he was an \"unlucky\" bowler; Les Favell was dropped in the first over and Arthur Morris was beaten four times before being trapped leg before in the last over before tea to make Australia 27/1. In the first over after tea Favell was out when a ball from Tyson ricocheted off his bat and carried 120 feet to Bill Edrich in the slips, who caught it chest-high. Somehow Jim Burke and Neil Harvey survived the session as they played and missed and Tyson made the ball rear up from a length. Burke didn't score for almost an hour, but by the end of the day they were 72/2 and Australia needed only 151 more runs for victory.\nBurke did not long survive the morning as Tyson moved a ball back up the hill to flatten his stumps. Graeme Hole had a high backlift and failed to get his bat down in time to trap a yorker and was clean bowled by Tyson at 77/4. Hutton now rested his fast bowlers and brought on Trevor Bailey and Bob Appleyard to slow down the scoring and tie up the batsman. Richie Benaud was not a patient batsman and took a swipe at \"Applecart\" which he hit sky high to Tyson in the deep, who only managed to snatch it inches above the grass to have Australia 102/5. Neil Harvey was now getting into his stride and in what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, he counter-attacked the bowling, cutting short balls and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side and once hooking Tyson over fine leg's head for four. By lunch he and Ron Archer had taken the score to 118/5 and as long has Harvey was in the Australians thought they could win. After the interval Tyson and Statham were brought back on, with immediate results as Tyson felled Archer's stumps with another fast ball. Alan Davidson lasted only 6 balls before he was caught by the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans off Statham. Statham was phenomenally accurate, conceding only 45 runs off 19 eight-ball overs. Tyson bled runs at double that rate, as Tom Graveney recalled \"I was fielding in the slips and we were having to stand 40 yards off the bat, and \"still\" the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots\". Ray Lindwall came in fearing the bouncer, and it was his undoing as he turned a Tyson half-volley into a yorker by playing off the back foot and was bowled.\nHarvey now started to farm the bowling ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders from Tyson and Statham as he attacked the fast bowlers, but wicket-keeper Gil Langley was bowled by Statham for a duck to leave Australia 145/9, \"...which on paper meant that the result was now almost surely ordained: but it scarcely seemed that way on the spot, partly because Harvey was in such devastating form, and equally because the fast bowlers were almost burst\". Last man Bill Johnston was in and Australia still needed 78 to win, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in the next 40 minutes. Tyson recalled \"Bill Johnston did his bit for his team with true Aussie grit. His speciality stroke was a right-handed, one-handed, back-handed, glancing scoop off the line of his bum – cricket's equivalent of tennis' back-handed retrieve. It bought him a dozen runs – plus a considerable amount of pain when he failed to make contact and the ball clipped his maximus gluteus!\" Finally Tyson bowled a ball closer to his body on the advice of Statham and a thin edge was enough for Evans to finish the innings and the match. Johnston was out for 11 and Neil Harvey had made a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no one else made 15. Together they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required when Johnston came in, it was heroic, but not enough and England won by 38 runs. The other hero of the day was \"Typhoon Tyson\", who had powered his way through the Australian batting, taking 6/85 (10–130 in the match) with Statham (3/45) in indefatigable support.\nResult.\nEngland beat Australia by 38 runs to even the series 1–1 and THE TOAST IS: TYPHOON TYSON! was the headline as the papers hailed the new sensation. Arthur Morris told the newspapers \"Such fine bowling deserved to win\", Don Bradman thought it was the fastest bowling he had ever seen and John Arlott wrote \"This was intelligence, rhythm and strength merged into the violent craft of fast bowling\". \"Seldom has fortune swayed as it did in this game\" wrote E.W. Swanton and for years it was regarded as one of the most eventful and exciting Tests seen in Australia. Henry Sayden had danced for joy with MCC Secretary Ronnie Aird at the fall of each Australian wicket, took the entire England team to a celebratory dinner at Prince's Restaurant and handed out bonuses all round.\nThird Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nDespite the loss of the Sydney Test the Australians were still confident, they had won by an innings, England had won narrowly in the absence of the Australian captain Ian Johnson and the great all-rounder Keith Miller, who now returned to the team. Miller was playing despite the advice of his doctor who warned him not to bowl on his injured knee and said himself that he didn't think his back could take the strain of bowling. Len Maddocks replaced Gil Langley as wicket-keeper as the latter had been hit in the eye by a bail in a Sheffield Shield match. England received Denis Compton at the expense of Tom Graveney, but faced a crisis on the first day of the Test when Len Hutton refused to leave his bed because of his fibrositis and a heavy cold. The manager Geoffrey Howard, George Duckworth, Bill Edrich and Godfrey Evans had to persuade him to play so as to not damage the morale of the team, especially as the series was locked at 1–1. Finally Hutton agreed to play and went to the ground. The wicket was worse than Sydney. After the MCC's match against Victoria it had broken up completely had had to be repaired and was covered with cracks even before the Test began.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"Runs did not flow; they were grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as delivery after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through the cover and mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. When I joined him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I hope that I am there to see it.\"\nLen Hutton won the toss and elected to bat on New Year's Eve, but soon regretted it. Regardless of his crook knee and bad back Miller opened the bowling with a 90-minute spell of 9–8–5–3 to send Hutton, Edrich (the captain's third opening partner in as many Tests) and Compton back to the pavilion in quick time. With Ray Lindwall dismissing Peter May for a duck England were 41/4 and in deep trouble, but according to Ralph Barker, after \"Surviving the early horrors through perfect technique, the 22-year-old Cowdrey made 50 out of 69 and 100 out of 158\". He completed his maiden Test century, adding 74 with Trevor Bailey (30) and 54 with wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (20) before falling to Ian Johnson with a ball that \"hit the edge of one of the cracks in the wicket, which was now assuming the appearance of a tessellated pavement. It jagged back to pass behind Kipper's pads and hit his leg stump!\". Bill O'Reilly, not an easy man to impress, said that it was the best Test innings he had ever seen and aged only 22 Cowdrey was the youngest Englishman to make an Ashes century since Jack Hearne on the same ground in 1912. Although Cowdrey would make 22 Test centuries they would all be measured against the yardstick of his Melbourne hundred, and still it remained greatest innings; \"his driving, concentration and command were all faultless...a tribute to his wonderful ability\". Ron Archer (4/33) wrapped up the tail and England fell from 181/6 to 191 all out at the end of the first day.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nStill the wicket gave hope to the England bowlers and wickets fell at a steady rate throughout New Year's Day to leave Australia 181/8, only Arthur Morris and Les Favell failing to each double figures. The next day was a Sunday and a rest day, but its events were to be of great importance. Fearing that the wicket would break up in the middle of the Test it was surreptitiously and illegally watered to bind the cracks and make it last an extra couple of days. Worse still Percy Barnes of \"The Age\" reported that he had overheard the MCG sprinkers during the night. Frank Tyson reckoned that\n\"had he not acted there can be little doubt that there would have been hardly any wicket left on the Monday\". An official enquiry by the Victorian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Cricket Club denied any watering of the playing area during the match and claimed that the wicket must have sweated under the tarpaulin despite the baking heat and dry wind. Some scientists theorised that the dry weather drew up water from underground and the wicket watered itself, but a Sydney reporter asked \"has anyone worked out how the wicket rolled itself out to close up all those cracks\". \"Wisden\" stated \"large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen\". Fortunately as England were due to bat Hutton thought he gained from the incident and did not complain, but Ian Johnson said \"It was like losing the toss twice over\". The proof of the pudding wicket was that Len Maddocks (47), Ian Johnson (33 not out) and Bill Johnston (11) added another 50 runs before Statham (5/60) finished off the innings, the first time he had taken five wickets in a Test innings.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nStarting 40 runs behind Len Hutton (42) and Bill Edrich (13) evened the score for the first wicket, Hutton was so ill that he could not take off his pads for an hour after returning to the dressing room, but remained slumped in a corner. Peter May held the innings together with a classic 91 then \"Barnacle\" Bailey (24 not out off 144 balls) held up one end while Evans (22) and Wardle (38) made runs at the other. Bill Johnston was bowling Slow-Left-Arm spin, which Wardle had hit all over the ground when the Australians played Yorkshire in 1953 and he had hit 7 fours in his 38. Keith Miller told him \"Now, Bill, don't bowl that slow stuff against to Wardle\", told him to bowl quicker and Johnston took the last 3 wickets for 6 runs. His 5/85 was the only Australian five wicket haul in the series, and England were all out for 279.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nAustralia were set 240 to win, but Tyson had Arthur Morris caught for 4 by Colin Cowdrey. As \"Les Favell got going, his wicket went tumbling\", bowled for 30 by Bob Appleyard. Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud took the score to 75/2 by stumps and over 50,000 supporters came on the fifth day to see them knock off the remaining runs, but what they got was \"the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia\". as Tyson sent Australia crashing to 111 all out – the dreaded Triple Nelson – and England won by 128 runs. Australia added only 36 runs that morning as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 eight-ball overs, 7/27 in the innings, hurtling down from the Richmond End and slightly into the breeze, but at enormous pace. The first wicket to fall was \"a phenomenal piece of cricket\" described by Neville Cardus as \"Harvey flicked the seventh ball of the morning (from Tyson) round the corner and this time Evans dived full length to the right, clutching the ball in his out-stretched glove\". Evans had anticipated Harvey's stroke and had moved to leg before making his \"prodigious leap\" and \"thought this almost his best catch\". Richie Benaud chopped the ball onto his stumps trying to hook, Keith Miller managed to block four shooters in a row from Statham, edging the last for four through his pads, but at the other end saw the ball ricochet off the shoulder of his bat, and deflect off Len Hutton's outstretched hand for Bill Edrich to leap backwards and take the catch. Graeme Hole in his final Test innings, edged Brian Statham behind to Evans, Len Maddocks couldn't repeat his first innings heroics and was bowled first ball by a Tyson yorker that he dug out, only to see it spin back into his wicket. Ray Lindwall, fearing a Tyson bouncer after Sydney, played back to a full-length ball and was lbw for a second ball duck, Ron Archer made 15 before he was bowled by a Statham yorker, and Bill Johnston lasted only three balls before he hung his bat outside off-stump and was caught behind off Tyson to end the innings on 111, with captain Ian Johnson unbeaten with 4. The match finished well before lunch and the Melbourne Cricket Club caterers were left with thousands of unsold meat pies as the crowd deserted the ground.\nResult.\n\"Len Hutton was delirious with happiness. He, England's first professional captain, was leading a triumphant team – in Australia!...He frowns on 'sleeping with the enemy' and counsels against our going into the Aussie dressing-room to fraternise with our affable opponents. In Melbourne, however, he could afford to be magnanimous. After the game he threw open the door of the English dressing room. The champagne flowed, flooding well into the night.\"\nThe Third Test cemented Tyson's \"Typhoon\" reputation and made him a sporting legend as England beat Australia by 128 runs to take a 2–1 lead in the series. He became only the fifth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68) and Doug Wright (7/105). The Test was referred to in the Goon Show, in the original script of episode 15 of their fifth series \"1985\" broadcast on 5 January 1955 Neddie Seagoon wanders into an antique shop in 1985 and sees an old cricket bat. The shop-owner tells him \"As a matter of fact this bat was used in the very last test by an Australian opening bat, you can see it's quite unmarked\". The bat's ownership was changed to Len Hutton when broadcast because of the England captain's poor form.\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\nPreliminaries.\nDespite the form of Peter Loader and Alec Bedser in the recent tour matches England kept their winning team from Melbourne and Len Hutton even kept Bill Edrich as his opening partner. The Australian selection process was more confused. Vice-captain Arthur Morris was somewhat unfairly blamed for the Sydney and Melbourne disasters and was dropped in favour of Colin McDonald, then Les Favell was dropped after his failure in the recent tour match and Morris was recalled on the morning of the match. Graeme Hole had also played poorly for South Australia against the MCC was dropped and Jim Burke was recalled. Worse for Australia Ray Lindwall pulled a muscle in the Queensland-Victoria game and Alan Davidson had to be brought in. Though South Australia's Gil Langley had recovered and made a fifty against the MCC Victoria's Len Maddocks kept his place as wicket-keeper due to his batting in the Third Test and was booed by the local crowd, who cheered Langley when he visited the Australian dressing room.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nIan Johnson won the toss in the sweltering 100 °F/38 °C heat and chose to bat on the best surface seen since Brisbane. Again nine Australian batsmen got into double figures, Colin McDonald (48) and Arthur Morris (25) added 59 for the first wicket, and Keith Miller made 44. Hutton made himself unpopular with his deliberately slow over rates so that he could rest his exhausted fast bowlers, and Brian Statham ripped the nail off his right big toe and had to hack a hole in his boot so he could continue to bowl. It was Bob Appleyard (3/58) who made the breakthrough, dismissing MacDonald, Miller and Benaud, with Tyson (3/85) and Bailey (3/39) in support as Australia fell to 229/8. Len Maddocks (69) justified his selection and was the only man to pass fifty, adding 92 for the ninth wicket with Ian Johnson (41) until Bailey removed the captain. Maddocks was run out two runs later and Australia were dismissed for 323 on the afternoon of the second day.\nEngland – First Innings.\nLen Hutton (80) and Bill Edrich (20) saw England through to stumps and took the score to 60 the next morning before the first wicket fell. Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's back, where it lobbed up for an easy, if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 by the end of the day and England were confident of a first innings lead, but they both fell early next morning and though the lower middle order all got going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) doing most of the work.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nIn the Australian second innings Hutton made his bowling changes with great cunning, removing Tyson and Statham after a few overs and bringing on Bob Appleyard whose 3/12 accounted for Morris, Burke and Harvey before the day was out, leaving the home side on 69/3. Expecting more spin the next day the Aussies were confronted by Tyson (3/47) and Statham (3/38) at their most lethal. Statham's motto was \"if they miss, I hit\". and he bowled MacDonald before a run was added, then bowled Miller and caught Maddocks lbw. Frank Tyson took care of Benaud and Archer and 69/3 was soon 83/8. Alan Davidson (23) added some respectability to the lower order, but Australia were out for 111 and the dreaded Triple Nelson had struck again.\nEngland second innings.\nEngland needed only 94 runs to win the Test, win the series and retain the Ashes, but Miller (3/40) had other ideas, sending Hutton, Edrich and Cowdrey back to the pavilion for 18 and catching Peter May off Bill Johnston (2/20). Denis Compton (34 not out) saw England through and Godfrey Evans came in at the fall of the 5th wicket to hit the winning runs with a boundary.\nResult.\nEngland beat Australia by 5 wickets to take a 3–1 lead in the series and retain the Ashes. It was the first time any touring team had won a series in Australia since 1932–33. They were only the second touring team to win there from behind after J.W.H.T Douglas's 1911–12 England Team. The England celebrations lasted through the night, starting in the dressing room before moving on to the South Australian Cricket Association Committee Room and the team hotel before moving round the city, consuming 56 bottles of champagne at the hotel alone. Bill Edrich – the life and soul of any party – climbed the marble pillar in the lounge of Glenelg's Pier Hotel and sung \"Ginger\".\nFifth Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nThe only change in the England team was that Bill Edrich was dropped for poor form and replaced by Tom Graveney, who became Hutton's fourth opening partner of the series. Colin Cowdrey had a broken nose from fielding at Adelaide and Trevor Bailey had a broken finger from playing Victoria, but both still played, though Bailey did not bowl in the Test. With an eye to the imminent tour of the West Indies the Australian selectors picked debutants Peter Burge and Bill Watson and Les Favell and Ray Lindwall returned to the side. To make way Arthur Morris, Bill Johnston, Ken Archer and Jim Burke were dropped (Morris, Johnston and Archer having already been picked for the West Indies).\nEngland – First Innings.\nThe first three days were lost to heavy rain and only 13 hours play were available when the captains went out on the fourth afternoon to toss, Johnson winning and putting England in to bat. Hutton was out quickly, but Graveney effortlessly stroked his way to 111 out of 182 in two and a half hours, adding 176 with May (79). Crowdey was out first ball, but Compton (84) and Bailey (72) added 134 and Hutton declared on 371/7, easily England's best score of the series. Amazingly Bailey gave Lindall his wicket to record his 100th England wicket in the mistaken belief that with was the fast bowler's last Ashes Test and \"at one stroke achieved heights of Australian popularity to which he could scarcely have aspired\". Lindwall ending with (3/77) and his captain (3/68).\nAustralia – First Innings.\nColin McDonald responded with 72, adding 53 for the first wicket with Bill Watson (18), but Maddocks (32) was the only other batsman to make more than 20 as the England spinner Johnny Wardle (5/79) worked his way through their batting with a mixture of orthodox slow left arm spin mixed with chinamen and reverse googlies. Johnson was run out when the last wicket fell for 221 and believed that the follow on had been avoided, but due to the three days lost Hutton could enforce the follow on despite being only 150 runs ahead and promptly did so. It was the first time Australia had followed on for eighteen years, when a young Hutton had made his world record 364 at the Kensington Oval in 1938.\nAustralia second innings.\nMacdonald (37) watched the wickets fall about him again and at 29/3 Australia were in danger of an innings defeat as Wardle (3/51) struck again. Miller (28), Burge (18 not out) and Benaud (22) stopped the rot, but Hutton did not concede the draw until he brought himself on in the final over, bowling Benaud with the last ball of the series. Australia finally ended on 118/6, still 32 runs short of making England bat again.\nResult.\nEngland drew with Australia to win the series 3–1\nThe Ashes Calypso.\nThe calypso singer Lord Kitchener released a single The Ashes (Australia vs MCC 1955) to celebrate their victory Play Recording:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Tyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,\"\n\"Tyson taught them a lesson that can't be forgotten,\"\n\"We began quietly, but we came back with victory,\"\n\"Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\"\n\"Australia's tragedy, it began at Sydney,\"\n\"Magnificent Tyson, had their batsmen beaten,\"\n\"He went on to give us, a victory for Christmas,\"\n\"Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\"\n\"More shocks for Australia, the Melbourne disaster,\"\n\"Les Favell got going, his wicket went tumbling,\"\n\"We got them out cheaply, and score second victory,\"\n\"Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\"\n\"The bowling was so good, it remind them of Larwood,\"\n\"Maginificent Tyson finished with seven for twenty-seven,\"\n\"They had no excuses, we regained the Ashes,\"\n\"Good captaincy from Len Hutton, but the honours must go to Typhoon Tyson.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\n1954–55 Test Series Averages.\nsource As was the convention of the time gentleman amateurs have their initials in front of their surname and professional players have their initials after their name, if used at all. The Australians were all amateurs until the Packer Revolution, even though they played like professionals. In a dinner for the teams by the Australian Board of Control Hutton gave a speech asking when the Australian players were going to see some of the £100,000 the ABC had made from the 1953 tour of England \"You rich men get all the money – why don't the players get more?\" and asked \"Miller and Lindwall have done so much for Australian cricket – what are you going to do for them?\" and suggested they should have a benefit."

        "title": "1970–71 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1970–71 Ashes series was the 45th edition of the long-standing cricket rivalry between England and Australia. Starting on 27 November 1970, the two sides ended up playing seven Tests; six were originally scheduled, but one extra Test was added to compensate for the abandoned Third Test.\nAustralia went into the series as the holders of the urn, having successfully defended it in 1968, drawing the series 2-all. However, they went into the 1970-71 series having suffered a demoralising 4-0 series defeat in South Africa. Meanwhile, England had gone undefeated in Test cricket since losing at Old Trafford in 1968. Ray Illingworth was appointed captain after the incumbent Colin Cowdrey had injured an Achilles early in 1969, and led England to series victories against West Indies and New Zealand during that English summer. \nThe Test matches were scheduled for five days with six hours play each day, with a rest day on the Monday, and overs were eight balls long. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1970–71 and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. Ray Illingworth's England team beat Bill Lawry's Australians 2–0 and regained the Ashes, the only full Test series in Australia in which the home team failed to win a Test. \"The Momentous Series of 1970–71\" was pivotal in cricket history and \"essentially ushered in the modern period of Test cricket\". It was the first Test series to have more than five Tests and the first One Day International in cricket history was played in Melbourne; like the first test match in history it was won by Australia.\nRay Illingworth's use of hostile, short-pitched fast-bowling by John Snow, Ken Shuttleworth, Bob Willis and Peter Lever heralded the dominance of fast bowling in the 1970s and 1980s, as did the decline of behaviour by players as the England team united under against ineffectual management, biased umpires, tabloid press and hostile crowds. Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood, and has not been exceeded since. Geoff Boycott had his most prolific series with 657 runs (93.85), John Edrich made 648 runs (72.00), which kept him at the crease for a record 33 hours and 26 minutes, and Brian Luckhurst 455 runs (56.87). Together these three opening batsmen added 995 runs (90.45) for the first wicket with five century and three half-century opening stands.\nRod Marsh, Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Terry Jenner, Alan Thomson, Kerry O'Keeffe, Ross Duncan, Ken Eastwood and Tony Dell made their debuts for Australia and Bob Willis, Brian Luckhurst, Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever for England. It also saw the retirement of Bill Lawry and Garth McKenzie from the Australian team and Don Bradman after 35 years as a selector. The WACA Ground in Perth saw its inaugural Test match, the first new venue in an Ashes Test since the Brisbane Cricket Ground at Woolloongabba in 1928–29.\nResults summary.\nEngland won the 7-Test series 2–0.\nMatch Details.\nFirst Test, 27 November–2 December.\nThe Australian selectors handed Test debuts to three players: Alan Thomson, the 6 ft 2 Victorian paceman with a trademark windmill delivery action, was called up for his debut after taking 6/80 and 3/101 in Victoria's victory over the tourists, along with Western Australian wicket-keeper Rod Marsh and South Australian leg-spinner Terry Jenner. For England, opener Brian Luckhurst and fast bowler Ken Shuttleworth would be handed their first Test caps. The MCC had struggled in the state matches, losing one and drawing the three others. Though Geoff Boycott, Brian Luckhurst, John Edrich and Basil d'Oliveira had batted well none of their bowlers had made their mark and Australia was confident that they had the upper hand. Australian umpire Tom Brooks was officiating in his first Test.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nIt was a remarkable day's cricket here at \"the Gabba\". The crowd on the hill shouted \"Ave a Go\" only 21 times. This was a record for the first day of the first Test against England in Brisbane. The previous record was about 2,800. This was partly due to the eloquence with the bat of Keith Stackpole...tremendously spectacular and entertaining to watch but you felt he was about to slip any second...When running between the wickets...he looks like one of those vintage steam traction engines. And almost as fast.\nBill Lawry won the toss and chose to bat on a good wicket, but became John Snow's 100th Test victim, caught by Alan Knott for 4 off an attempted hook. Keith Stackpole had been promoted from the middle order to open the innings as along with Lawry he was the only Australian who had any confidence against short-pitched bowling. He should have been run out for 18, Geoff Boycott throwing down the wicket at the bowler's end with Derek Underwood backing up. The batsman was given the benefit of the doubt by Lou Rowan, but the Australian newspapers carried photographs the next day showing that he had failed to ground his bat as he crossed the line. This formed a major point of controversy in the media and Rowan's decision was hyperbolically labelled \"one of the worst in cricket history\". It probably cost England victory as Stackpole went on to make his highest Test score of 207, adding 151 with Ian Chappell (59) and 209 with Doug Walters (112). The new ball was taken in the afternoon, but had to be replaced after five overs due to complaints from Snow and Shuttleworth, though Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Bill O'Reilly and Jack Fingleton could find little wrong with it in the press box. Stackpole was told in the afternoon drinks break that he was nearing Bradman's record 187 against England at the Gabba and as a result dug himself in and failed to score for the last half-hour of the day, leaving Australian 308/2. John Edrich met a spectator when fielding on the boundary who told him \"You're following in your cousin's footsteps you know. I was sitting here 25 years ago and he spent all day chasing the ball along the same piece of grass. He didn't stop much either\". A frustrated Snow forced a nervous Walters to dodge three bouncers in a row and was warned by the umpires for intimidation, not for the last time in the series. Stackpole crawled to 200 on the second day, hit Illingworth for six and gave what may have been a catch behind off Snow at 372/3. He was visibly wilting in the heat and gladly took the opportunity to walk with 207 against his name. Australia looked set to make a huge score, but soon after lunch Illingworth threw himself full length to take a spectacular catch at silly mid-on to dismiss Ian Redpath off Derek Underwood (3/101). Keith Dunstan noted that \"Underwood is inclined to wear a hole in the pitch by dropping the ball on the same spot...\", but his first 236 balls had failed to take a wicket, now \"Deadly Derek\" took two wickets in four balls; dismissing Sheahan for a duck and Walters for 112 as 418/3 became 421/6. Snow (6/114) ran through the lower order – Jenner, Gleeson and Thomson all failed to score – and Australia were all out for 433. The loss of seven Australian wickets for 15 runs was their worst collapse since Alec Bedser took 14/99 and Australia fell from 237/3 to 249 all out at Trent Bridge in 1953. As commentator Ted Dexter put it 'People say cricket's slow. I always tell them, \"You just have to be prepared to wait a long time between the thrills\"'.\nEngland – First Innings.\n\"As I departed just in front of Cannery Row there was a pile of beer cans like a golden pyramid. I would estimate the rate of the day's play at 2,000 cans per wicket and 20 cans per run.\" Dunstan wasn't far off target. On the first three days of the Test 35,093 spectators consumed 36,872 cans of beer and 890 gallons of draught. The grand total, according to statisticians, was 4,816 gallons...there could not have been many teetotalleers at this Meeting Place of Many Waters.\nThe veteran Garth McKenzie and debutant Alan Thomson departed from line and length with the new ball and Geoff Boycott (37) and Brian Luckhurst (74) added 92 for the first wicket. In the increasing gloom Boycott tried to square-cut a long hop from Johnny Gleeson and edged it to Rodney Marsh, providing the keeper with the first of his 355 victims in Test cricket. Alan Knott came in as nightwatchman and was bounced by Thomson in the poor light, Jack Fingleton claiming that 'He can be excused. he doesn't know where he is bowling.'. In the morning – the first Sunday's play at the Gabba – Knott took his score to 73, joined by John Edrich (79) and Basil d'Oliveira (57) as they slowly batted into the fourth afternoon with the crowd giving them a slow hand-clap. The Monday was a rest day with three and a half inches of rain falling, but the wicket was covered, so there would be no danger of a gluepot as in the 1950–51 Brisbane Test. The following day Colin Cowdrey (28) overtook Wally Hammond's record of 7,249 runs to become the most prolific Test batsmen, which earned him an ovation from the crowd. The \"Golden Arm\" of Doug Walters was able to both swing the ball and produce line and length to dismiss Knott, take the last two wickets and return figures of 3/12, but the other bowlers suffered; McKenzie 2/90, Thomson 1/136, Gleeson 2/92 and Jenner 1/86. Rod Marsh had been brought in as wicket-keeper because of his superior batting skills and took four catches, but dropped three as he fumbled the ball and was dubbed \"Iron Gloves\" by the press. England overtook the Australian total to finish with 464, the third highest Test innings without a century at the time, to give them a lead of 31 runs. The Australian selector Neil Harvey commented that Ray Illingworth \"gave up any thought of going for a win when he lost the toss\", and most of the commentators agreed.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nSnow and Shuttleworth simply lolled back to bowl and each of their overs occupied more than five minutes. The advantage to a pace bowler of slouching between deliveries and winning a longer rest while one's partner is bowling should be obvious...The spectators saw far more of Snow, Shuttleworth, Lever and Willis's walking during the series than they saw of their running.\nAustralia lost two wickets before stumps, then collapsed on the fifth morning to 214 all out. Only the captain made any real resistance, batting for five and a half hours for his 84, though Redpath spent two hours making 28. Surprisingly the destroyer was debutant fast bowler Ken Shuttleworth who took 5/47, his best bowling for England and his only 5 wicket haul in Tests.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nNeeding 183 in just over an hour England were unlikely to win and when Terry Jenner caught and bowled Boycott for 16 it was decided to call an end to the match. England were left on 39/1, paying the price for their slow first innings.\nResult.\nNext morning Bobby Simpson wrote, 'England have come out of the Test with a moral victory.' They could have had a flesh and blood triumph.\nDespite the Australians collapsing in both innings they drew the First Test with England to leave the teams 0–0 in the series. 42,376 people attended the match over the five days, paying $36,612.10 at the gate.\nSecond Test – Perth.\nPreliminaries.\nI wonder if Bill Lawry and Ray Illingworth knew of the tremendous effort that had been put by the people of Western Australia into the staging of this 205th Test between England and Australia? I wonder whether their teams were aware of it? If the answer to both of these questions is in the affirmative, their reaction was lamentable – by and large...they muffed it – massacred it.\nThis was the inaugural Test match at the WACA Ground in Perth and the first new venue in an Ashes Test since the Brisbane Cricket Ground at Woolloongabba in 1928–29. Western Australia had won the Sheffield Shield in 1947–48 on percentages even though they had played fewer games than the eastern states and outright in 1968–69. Test status was granted to the WACA for the 1970–71 Ashes series and although its playing conditions were equal to any in Australia $400,000 was raised to build extra stands and improve the facilities. The state government supplied $100,000 and Perth City Council another $20,000. The remaining $280,000 was raised by public subscription, with Norm O'Neill, Keith Slater and Peter Loader touring the state in aid of the cause. Farmers donated barley, wheat, oats, timber, sheep and cattle to be sold for the fund, one town built and sold a house and the racehorse \"La Loire\" made $18,000 in a raffle. 'Pre-Test interest was tremendous. You could not make a move in Perth just prior to the Test without breakfasting, lunching and dining-out on cricket...' On a pitch expected to suit fast bowling the two sides dropped their spinners Terry Jenner and Derek Underwood. The Lancashire fast-medium swing bowler Peter Lever made his Test debut as did Greg Chappell, the young South Australian all-rounder who had been twelfth man at Brisbane. However, this gave Australia only three specialist bowlers; Garth McKenzie, Alan Thomson and John Gleeson and England four; John Snow, Ken Shuttleworth, Peter Lever and Ray Illingworth. Lindsay Hassett commented that \"you can scarcely get a decent Test attack from the two sides\".\nEngland – First Innings.\nLawry, the conservative, became Lawry, the cavalier...He was not the \"Laughing Cavalier\"...Did he hope that there was a vestige of early life in the reputedly fast Perth wicket? If he did, he was disappointed, for, while McKenzie did manage to make a few deliveries rise with shoulder strength and even rapped Luckhurst painfully on the hand, the pitch remained placidly amenable all day.\nBill Lawry won the toss and to the amazement of the Australian commentators put England in to bat, later saying that he had only one spinner and did not expect the wicket to turn. Ray Illingworth requested the use of a roller on the wicket before play began, but this was turned down by umpire Lou Rowan, who apologised in the lunch break when he realised his mistake. Even so, Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst added 171 for the first wicket when Boycott was out for 70. Luckhurst made his maiden Test century (131) despite having his thumb injured by McKenzie on 15. With the help of John Edrich (47) he took England to 243 before a second wicket fell and they finished the first day on 257/2. Their cause was helped by Rod Marsh, Ian Chappell and Keith Stackpole dropping five catches between them, three off Garth McKenzie playing on his home turf. The next day Greg Chappell caught and bowled Colin Cowdrey for 40 at 389/7 and McKenzie (4/66) wrapped up the tail to dismiss England for 397 after batting for 10 dreary hours. Greg Chappell (1/54), Walters (1/35) and Stackpole (0/33) bowled 54 eight-ball overs between them to make up for the loss of a fourth bowler.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nMy first innings in Test cricket was, as you might expect, a trying experience, but proved to be one of the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australian reeling at 5/107 to join \"Redders\", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. \"Snowy\" concentrated his attack short of a length on \"Redders\" off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at \"Snowy\". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then I had better make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and out partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.\nJohn Snow (4/143) gave Australia a torrid start, sending Bill Lawry and Keith Stackpole back to the pavilion with 8 runs on the board, the batsmen having already survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever. Lever then had Doug Walters caught behind by Alan Knott to make it 17/3. Ian Chappell (50) and Ian Redpath saw out the day and added 88 before they were parted, but Paul Sheahan was run out for 2 and Greg Chappell came in at 107/5. In 1968 a 21-year-old Chappell had batted for Somerset, but when they played Sussex at Hove he was cracked on the head by a nasty bouncer from Snow and forced to retire hurt. He was therefore under no illusions as to his likely reception from the fiery fast bowler in the Test arena. Redpath made his highest Test score of 171 before he was caught and bowled by Illingworth. Chappell spent 40 minutes making 1, but after tea he hit 58 runs inside an hour to bring up his maiden Test century, 108 in his first Test innings as they put on 219 for the sixth wicket. He was the eleventh Australian to make a century on his Ashes debut after Charles Bannerman, Harry Graham, Reggie Duff, Roger Hartigan, Herbie Collins, Bill Ponsford, Archie Jackson, Neil Harvey, Jim Burke and Doug Walters. He gave Brian Luckhurst a catch off Ken Shuttleworth, but \"Bill Lawry didn't go crook on me when I got back into the rooms, so I guess it didn't matter\". Rod Marsh added 40 and Australia overtook England's total with seven wickets down and ended with 440, a lead of 43.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nEngland's fourth day batting made the death march seem like an Irish jig.\nBoycott and Luckhurst accounted for the arrears by adding 60 for the first wicket, but the Yorkshireman was stumped by Rod Marsh off Gleeson on 98/1, Fletcher was lbw in the same over and Cowdrey soon followed and England were 101/4. John Edrich made typically stalwart 115 not out, batting for nearly six hours, and allowed Illingworth to make a late declaration on 287/6, leaving Australia 245 to win less than three hours, which Lawry described as a 'joke'.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nThe England substitute fielder John Hampshire gave the tourists the hope of a collapse when he caught Stackpole and Ian Chappell off John Snow (2/17) and Australia were 20/2. Snow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling, but continued to bowl short. He was given an official warning, but Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said \"Now that's a bouncer for you\". Walters was bowled by Lever for 8, but Bill Lawry made 38 not out and Ian Redpath added an unbeaten 26 to his first innings century and the match ended with Australia 100/3.\nResult.\nThey came to watch cricket sanctioned by the uncharacteristically over-cautious Bradmans and Allens and the Illingworths and the Lawrys of this world, God pity them and theirs. And what was their reward? Some great bowling by John Snow, one great 50 by Greg Chappell, some cover drives from Geoff Boycott that would have done for Hobbs, Stackpole's occasional audacity and some wicketkeeping from Alan Knott that only Don Tallon has matched.\nAustralia and England drew the second Test to maintain their 0–0 tie in the series. Ray Illingworth blamed his bowlers and Bill Lawry his fieldsmen for their failure to win the match. 84,142 spectators paid $106,748 in gate money over the five days of the Test When the attendance figures were announced over the public address system and found to be almost double that of their Brisbane rivals there were large cheers from the Perth crowd.\nThird Test – Melbourne.\nOur cricket administrators have been caught in the slops. But, perhaps, by unleashing this deluge, the gods have conspired to save us from the even greater boredom of having to watch another Test grind relentlessly to yet another draw.\nThe Australian selectors dropped Paul Sheahan (who Don Bradman had tipped as the future captain of Australia) and Terry Jenner and brought back the experienced fast-medium bowler Alan Connolly and the off-spinner Ashley Mallett, even though he was not liked by Bill Lawry. England kept the same team from Perth. Ray Illingworth won the toss and decided to field, but rain began to fall before the teams went out and after three days of continuous rain the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Desperate attempts to dry the boggy outfield were made by Ian Johnson and the MCG ground staff, who claimed that \"if the match had been in England the teams would have played. The outfield was good, the wicket firm and bowlers' run-ups safe\". Each day they announced that play would be able to start \"as soon as the rain stopped\" to encourage spectators to come to the ground. One English writer said that the 8,000 people who arrived on the Thursday would have 'gladly paid a dollar each to permit the M.C.G. to buy a proper cover'. Sir Cyril Hawker, President of the MCC, and Gubby Allen, the treasurer, happened to be in Melbourne and with David Clark arranged the historic One Day International for the fifth day with Sir Donald Bradman and the Australian Board of Control. They also cancelled the second tour match between Victoria and the MCC so that an extra Test could be played. Ray Illingworth and the England players were not consulted and only found out when Bradman came into the dressing room to thank them for their co-operation. The players had severe misgivings about this state of affairs as the extra Test might cost them the Ashes and cancelled one of their rest days. They now had only five rest days in the last six weeks of the tour, and these included official receptions and engagements. There was also the question of pay and it was several weeks before Clark was able to grant an extra £100, long after the Australians had agreed a pay deal with their team.\nFirst One Day International – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nWhen Lawry won the toss and sent England into bat, the accepted move in one-day, limited number of overs games, I noted an edginess and expectation among player and crowd that had been absent, even from Test cricket, for decades.\nThe first One Day International was hastily arranged for what would have been the fifth day of the abandoned Third Test. Fortunately there were enough senior officials in Melbourne from the MCC and ACB to sanction the match. It was to consist of 40 eight-ball overs for each team (320 balls, or 53.2 six-ball overs). Many were surprised at the 46,000 crowd who turned up to watch.\nEngland Innings.\nThen Boycott and Edrich began to run what in the Tests had been 'impossible' runs, to play what had been 'impossible' strokes...the Australian out-fieldsmen were hurling themselves about along the fence in a manner I had not seen for years in desperate endeavour to save fours and reduce runs.\nBill Lawry won the toss, elected to field and Garth McKenzie bowled the first ball to Geoff Boycott. To everyone's surprise Boycott and Edrich proceeded to hit the Australian bowlers around the ground and 'some of the less credulous Pressmen nearly fainted when John Edrich cracked Alan Connolly over mid off for four'. Alan Thomson was reduced to bowling 25 bouncers in 8 overs to reduce the run rate, but was not called for intimidation as they lacked menace. Lawry caught Boycott (8) off Alan Thomson (1/22) for the first wicket to fall in a One Day International after 21 runs had been added. Edrich made 82 runs off 119 balls and 'made all his partners look like hacks' No one else made 25 and he was instrumental in the England total of 190. Although spin bowlers were regarded as a target in one day cricket Ashley Mallett's off-spin took 3/34 and Keith Stackpole's part-time leg-spin 3/40, which compared favourably with the figures of the three fast bowlers Garth McKenzie (2/22), Alan Thomson (0/21) and Alan Connolly (0/62). England's 190 off 39.4 eight-ball overs was made at a rate of 60.12 runs per 100 balls (3.63 runs per six-ball over).\nAustralia Innings.\nThe crowd were roaring their applause at every run now as Australia swept to 152 for 3 in 140 minutes and then Chappell, hooking and driving and cutting with a will, took 14 of 17 from D'Oliveira's sixth over.\nAustralian needed 191 runs to win and did so without any great trouble. John Snow's first ball was a wide, but both he and the batsman Bill Lawry had to signal it before Umpire Brooks accepted it. His second over was hit for 12 runs by Keith Stackpole, who was caught and bowled by Ken Shuttleworth for 13. Ian Chappell made an awkward start and was out paced by Lawry, who made many quick singles until caught by Knott off Ray Illingworth (3/50), the only Englishman to bowl with conviction and Alan Knott took another catch and a stumping. With Snow taken off Ian Chappell 'went mad', hitting Illingworth for a six and a four and hooking and pulling Basil d'Oliveira for 26 runs in two overs, ending with 60 runs off 103 balls. Doug Walters made hay with 41 off 51 balls with 6 fours as he added 66 with Chappell for the third wicket. Greg Chappell (22 not out) batted 'like an Australian Peter May' and Australia won comfortably by five wickets. Their 191/5 off 34.6 eight-ball overs was made at a rate of 68.70 runs per 100 balls (4.12 runs per six-ball over).\nResult.\nTerrific. If they played cricket all the time like this, they'd pack the M.C.G. No risk. You can't tell me there's any less skill involved. I'd reckon there's more skill.\nAustralia won the first One Day International by five wickets on the same ground where they had won the first Test match 93 years before. They won $2,400 and England $400 from the sponsors Rothmans. John Edrich was awarded $200 as Man of the Match by the England umpire Charlie Elliott because \"without John's 82 there'd have been no match\". Despite the rain over the previous week 46,006 spectators paid $33,894.40 to attend the game, which was completed without a hitch. Even opponents of the limited over game such as E. W. Swanton admitted \"There is clearly a great future in this sort of thing\", and within a few years One Day International games were being played all over the cricketing world.\nFourth Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nIf you recall my would-be Sherlock Holmesian assessment of Professor Moriarty's – sorry, Professor Illingworth's – plan to recapture the Ashes, you will remember that it is in Sydney, in the Fourth Test, that this cricketing chess player is due to strike and then retire to the corner of his web and seal off reprisals. Those who command the condition of Sydney Cricket Ground and its accessories gave him just the pitch he needed. By this time, I fancy, they were nauseated by negation and demanded a win at any price – even at the price of Australian defeat.\nUnlike the flat, over-rolled batting tracks at the other venues the famous spinning wicket at the S.C.G. was expected to give a result and Bill Lawry announced \"This time there will be a result for sure\". England replaced their out of form vice-captain Colin Cowdrey with his Kentish team-mate Derek Underwood to give them five specialist bowlers. Ken Shuttleworth was replaced by fast bowler Bob Willis, playing his first Test. The Australians announced their team before the One Day International had been played, too late to replace Alan Connolly who had been hit for 62 runs off eight overs in the knockabout game. The erratic fast-medium bowler Alan Thomson was replaced on the field by the spinner John Gleeson. Thomson was made twelfth man, but was so popular that drinks were served two overs late as he struggled though the crowd of people chatting to him and patting him on the back Ray Illingworth won the toss again and chosen to bat on a 'hot and hostile' pitch which looked like helping the seamers, but was predicted to take increasing turn.\nEngland – First Innings.\nThis day Boycott was not so permissive and his innings shone like a sapphire in the sun. Lawry's field-settings seemed to be mirrored in the Yorkshireman's mind, so much so that when he went for his strokes there might as well have been no fieldsmen on the ground.\nThe wicket was not quite the batsman's paradise of the previous Tests, but after bowling a couple of maidens Garth McKenzie conceded 15 runs off his third over. Brian Luckhurst kept trying to steal singles, while his partner Geoff Boycott kept sending him back and England were 100/0 at lunch. Boycott was caught hooking by John Gleeson at fine-leg for 77 out of 116, and Gleeson had Luckhurst leg before wicket for 38 at 130/2. John Edrich made 55 before Gleeson caught him off Greg Chappell, Ashley Mallett (4/40) accounted for Fletcher and D'Oliveira, had Alan Knott stumped by Marsh to reduce England from 200/2 to 219/6. Gleeson bowled Illingworth for 24 and England were 267/7 at the end of the day. John Snow (37) made runs in the morning but Gleeson (4/83) struck again, dismissing him and Underwood in successive balls. Peter Lever (36) and Bob Willis (15 not out) added 41 for the last wicket to carry England to 332, the lowest first innings total of the series so far.\nAustralian – First Innings.\nSnow's first second-spell over the Walters and Redpath resembles one of those oldtime bombardments on the World War I Western Front. His first delivery was just short of a length and straight. His second was a lofty bumper, under which Walters ducked. His third was lifting offside ball...The fifth ball, called a no-ball by Umpire Rowan, was perhaps the most vicious bumper of all...Redpath turned his back on this one and the thud on his rump could be heard from most parts of the ground.\nThe Australian captain Bill Lawry chose to open with his vice-captain Ian Chappell, who did not look happy at the prospect, and Keith Stackpole was returned to the middle order. Strangely, Lawry did not consider opening with fellow-Victorian Ian Redpath during the series, despite having made a double century opening stand together against South Africa. However, in the 1970–71 season Lawry opened the Victorian batting with Keith Stackpole with 'Redders' coming in at number three. Lawry and Chappell were soon out and it was Redpath (64) and Doug Walters (55) who made the most of Australian's 189/4 by the end of what was regarded as the best day's play of the series. Their stand of 99 was made against the hostile bowling of John Snow (1/23) and Bob Willis (0/26), with the barrackers on the infamous Sydney Hill started hooting and counting Snow out as he bowled a host of short balls. in the end it was the spinners who did the damage, Walters was caught off Ray Illingworth (1/59) after being deceived in flight. Greg Chappell had just been made Australia's Sportsman of the Year 1970 ahead of Evonne Goolagong, Margaret Court, Heather McKay and Rod Laver, but was caught and bowled by Derek Underwood for 15 and Keith Fletcher caught Redpath off Basil d'Oliveira's off-spin (2/20) just before stumps. Resuming after the rest day Deadly Derek (4/66) dismissed Stackpole, Marsh and Mallett as Australia collapsed to 208/8 and 236 all out, 96 runs behind.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nThere are runs in that wicket but you have to be prepared to work for them.\nEngland now had two and a half days to pile up the runs and set Australia an impossible target on a wearing wicket. Geoff Boycott took nearly seven hours to make 142 not out having seen his partners Luckhurst, Edrich (run out by Boycott) and Fletcher depart with only 48 runs on the board. He added 133 with d'Oliveira (56), 95 with Illingworth (53) and 43 with Knott (21 not out) before the captain declared at 319/5 on the afternoon of the fourth day.\nAustralian – Second Innings.\nI had not seen an Englishman bowl either faster or better than Snow at Sydney since Tyson...In a fast bowler rhythm and accuracy generally go hand in hand. When everything is absolutely ticking, so to speak, a strong fellow like Snow finds not only an extra yard of pace but seems able to keep an unerring eye on the target. The merit of Snow is that in this form is not only that that high arm and loose wrist get the utmost life and lift from the pitch but that he is so extraordinarily straight.\nAustralia were set 416 runs for victory, in 1970 no Test team had ever made such a total to win a Test match and Bill Lawry announced there was \"no way\" they could win. It quickly became apparent that Australia would not be breaking any batting records as John Snow (7/40) soon dismissed Ian Redpath and both Chappells, Doug Walters fell to Peter Lever, one of Alan Knott's three catches, and Australia were 21/4. Bill Lawry (60 not out) and Keith Stackpole (30) took them to 60/4 by stumps, but Stackpole was caught off Snow the next morning, followed by Marsh for a duck. Willis (1/1) took his first Test wicket, Garth McKenzie retired hurt after being hit in the face by a rising ball from Snow and retired from Test cricket just two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian record haul of 248. Snow finished off the tail, bowling Gleeson for a duck and Connolly three balls later and Australia were all out for 116, Lawry carrying his bat throughout the debacle. It was a superb piece of fast bowling from Snow, aggressive, hostile and decisive.\nResult.\nThe Australian 'Humpty Dumpty' had fallen from the wall and, in our disgust at its fragility, we wondered how even all the king's horse and all the king's men, let alone Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey, could put it together again.\nEngland won by a huge margin of 299 runs, their biggest victory in Australia since 1936–37 to go 1–0 up in the series with three Tests to play. Geoff Boycott (77 and 142 not out) scored more runs for an English batsmen in Australia since Denis Compton (147 and 103 not out) in the Fourth Test of the 1946–47 Ashes series, a total since exceeded by Alastair Cook (67 and 235 not out) in the First Test of the 2010–11 Ashes series. John Snow (7/40) became the eighth England bowler to take seven wickets in a Test innings in Australia after Tom Richardson (8/94), George Lohmann (8/35 and 8/58), Wilfred Rhodes (7/56 and 8/68), Doug Wright (7/105), Frank Tyson (7/27), Brian Statham (7/57) and Fred Titmus (7/79). 101,694 spectators came to the see the Test, paying $71,017 in gate money.\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\nPreliminaries.\nIllingworth had moulded his men into a team. They had one mission uppermost in mind. High living, if it came at all, could come later.\nThis Test was added to the series to make up for the abandoned Third Test despite the reservations of some of the England players, replacing the Victoria vs MCC tour match scheduled for 22–26 January 1971. After the heavy defeat at Sydney the response of the Australian press was to \"Sack the Lot!\", but the selectors kept all their failing batsman and reshuffled their limited bowling attack, dropping Garth McKenzie, their fast bowling spearhead of the 1960s who had been injured by Snow, and Ashley Mallett despite his 4/40. The fast-medium bowler Alan Thomson swopped his twelfth man position with Alan Connolly The fast-medium bowler Ross Duncan made his Test debut, as did the leg-spinning all-rounder Kerry O'Keeffe who had taken 6/69 and hit 55 not out against the tourists earlier in the season. England recalled their vice-captain Colin Cowdrey (who had been in the nets for much of the Fourth Test) to replace Keith Fletcher, who had been injured in the tour match against North New South Wales. Brian Luckhurst bruised his fingers in the same game and had retired hurt, but was declared fit to play. Australian umpire Max O'Connell was officiating in his first Test.\nAustralian – First Innings.\nSnow aroused the ire of the crowd by firing down two bumpers to welcome back the retired hurt Bill Lawry back on the deck...A barracker yelled, 'Why don't you try to bump one onto the sightscreen, Snow? Bowl at the wicket.' Snow did just that next ball and took Redpath's leg stump – around behind his legs. Three for 269.\nBill Lawry won the toss and chose to bat on a good wicket with Keith Stackpole as his new opening partner. John Snow sent down three bouncers in the first four balls and Stackpole was caught by wicket-keeper Alan Knott off the last ball of the first over. However, he was given not out because Max O'Connell called \"over\" early and had already started his walk to square leg. Consequently, he had not seen the catch and had to give Stackpole not out. Instead Stackpole (30) and Lawry (56) added 64 for the first wicket when d'Oliveira dismissed Stackpole, soon followed by Lawry who retired hurt on 38 after he was hit on the hand several times with the score 86/1. They were followed by Ian Chappell (111) and Ian Redpath (72) who added another 180, a total of 202 for the second wicket. Lawry returned at 266/2 to a flurry of short balls from Snow, saw Redpath go on 269/3, but added 49 with Doug Walters (55). Bob Willis took 3/79 as the wickets were shared around the unfortunate England bowlers, whose cause was not helped by 8 dropped catches, 4 by Cowdrey's normally safe hands. Cowdrey and Chappell then had their Test caps stolen when the crowd invaded the pitch to celebrate Chappell's maiden Ashes century. Rod Marsh made 92 not out, after being dropped twice in one over off Derek Underwood, equalling the record set by Don Tallon for highest score by an Australian wicket-keeper. But Lawry declared the innings after batting for over 11 hours at 493/9 to get an extra hour of bowling before stumps at the end of the second day. When questioned by the press about his lost chance to make an historic century Marsh said he had gained forty runs instead of missing eight as he thought Lawry should have declared an hour earlier. Marsh would later make 132 against New Zealand at Adelaide in 1973–74, the first century by an Australian wicket-keeper, and his maiden Ashes century (110 not out) in the 1976–77 Centenary Test.\nEngland – First Innings.\nLawry's unimaginative, deep field-settings for his spinners sent a highly expectant, eager-for-victory crowd of 65,000 home unhappy. Even the most loyal Victorian could see, and admit, that Lawry was not the captain to arrest those escaping Ashes.\nEngland survived the day without losing a wicket, thus negating the advantage of Lawry's early declaration and adding to the criticism he received in the press. The next morning \"Froggie\" Thomson (3/110) dismissed Boycott and Edrich, John Gleeson (3/60) caught and bowled Colin Cowdrey and England were 88/3. Brian Luckhurst made a brave 109 to save the innings despite his hands being damaged again by Thomson's short-pitched bowling. He had three fingers of his right hand bound together and his left hand was in plaster, but he added 140 with Basil d'Oliveira (117). Thomson fired down six bouncers in one over against Ray Illingworth (41) and several more at John Snow, who was bowled by Ian Chappell for 1 after a stay of 47 minutes. Knott and Snow complained about Kerry O'Keeffe's \"suspect\" bowling action and were backed by Illingworth, which did not improve their popularity with the public, and Illingworth was booed in the final Tests as a result. England were finally out after tea on the fourth day for 392, 101 runs behind Australia.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nWhile Illingworth was guilty of go-slow tactics it was Lawry who helped put the lid on the coffin throughout the sweltering afternoon. His safety-first tactics were totally incomprehensible...Lawry Stackpole and Chappell were sad figures in that vast arena as they poked and prodded and had absolutely no desire to score runs as a reasonable pace.\nAustralia needed quick runs for a declaration, but Lawry spent two and a half hours making 42 and Ian Chappell over two hours for 30. John Snow bowled 12 eight ball overs for a mere 21 runs and the wickets of Lawry and Redpath. He was warned for intimidatory bowling by Max O'Connell after bowling short at Doug Walters (39 not out), despite no action having been taken against Thomson's bouncers earlier in the Test. Snow was also photographed picking at the seam of a Kookaburra cricket ball, which caused a furore in the Australian press until it was realised that the Kookaburra did not have a seam and Snow had been playing a practical joke on the cameraman. Lawry finally declared at 169/4, leaving England to make 271 in four hours.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nDo you want any more? I did not. I drove off to Adelaide...to face the next ordeal...\nAn adventurous or desperate captain might have taken up the challenge, but Illingworth was neither, Geoffrey Boycott and John Edrich were disinclined to throw their wickets away and had made an unbeaten stand of 161 when the game finally drew to a close. Ross Duncan in his only Test made 3 and took 0/30 in the first innings, did not bat or bowl in the second and took no catches.\nResult.\nAustralia and England drew the Fifth Test to maintain England's 1–0 lead in the series. 184,503 spectators attended, paying $135,022.80 in gate money.\nSixth Test – Adelaide.\nPreliminaries.\nWe were watching the crucifixion of cricket with Lawry and Illingworth washing their hands...like two Pontius Pilates.\nWith the Fourth Test replacing the tour match against Victoria Australia and England played back to back Test matches only two days apart, unusual at the time. Australian dropped the unfortunate Ross Duncan and brought in a tearaway young fast bowler called Dennis Lillee for his debut. Leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe was replaced by off-spinner Ashley Mallett on his home ground. England replaced the injured batsmen Brian Luckhurst and out of form vice-captain Colin Cowdrey with John Hampshire and Keith Fletcher, who was fit again after missing the Fifth Test.\nEngland – First Innings.\nWe were near the entrance to a bar when a roar penetrated the alleyway under the stairs. It was a kind of reaction from a crowd I'd not heard before...The roar went on...and on. There was no following applause to greet a departing batsman. The roar dropped to a murmur. Then there was silence. It was all very eerie.\nEngland won the toss and understandably decided to bat, with a 1–0 lead in the series they had no incentive to hurry and spent ten and a half hours making 470. Bill Lawry gave the new ball to 'Froggie' Thomason and had debutant Dennis Lillee bowling into a strong southerly wind, even so Lillee was yards faster than Thomson, and more accurate. Geoff Boycott (58) and John Edrich (130) added 107 for the first wicket before Boycott was given run out despite his strong opinion to the contrary. E.W. Swanton in the commentary box shouted \"He's out!\" when Ian Chappell threw down the stumps and as he had failed to ground his bat when reaching the crease Umpire O'Connell had given him out. Convincing Boycott that he was out was always a difficult business and his displeasure was obvious when he threw his bat to the ground, he caused further trouble when he pointedly refused to apologise to the umpires for his behaviour (Boycott later apologised to Umpire O'Connell in private). He stormed off the field with the crowd howling in his ears and to wide condemnation by the press when a photograph showed he was clearly out. Some called on David Clark to withdraw Boycott's £150 good conduct bonus and Keith Miller said \"This will cost Boycott the England and maybe also the Yorkshire captaincy\". Keith Fletcher returned to form with 80 out of a stand of 169 with Edrich before the Surrey opener was caught by Stackpole to give Lillee his first, hard earned, Test wicket. Lillee (5/84) dismissed Alan Knott, Alan Thomson bowled Fletcher and England lost three wickets for 13 runs, but soon found their way again. Basil D'Oliveira (47), John Hampshire (55), Ray Illingworth (24) and John Snow (38) took them to 458/6 before Lillee cleared up the tail, the last four wickets falling for twelve runs.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nThe cream of Australian batsmanship, barring one or two Test rejects, had curdled...\nBill Lawry and Keith Stackpole opened and Stackpole made 87 out of 117/2 before he was bowled by Derek Underwood. Australia collapsed to 180/7 thanks to Peter Lever (4/49). Rod Marsh and Ashley Mallett both made 28 and added 39 for the eighth wicket, but they were all out for 235 on Australia Day, exactly half of England's score.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nBoth Ray Illingworth and Bill Lawry have done some mystifying things this series, but the English captain must about win the prize with his decision not to force Australia to follow on...I know, for sure, that our captain in South Africa, Ali Bacher, would have told Lawry to put the pads on again.\nPeter Lever had a shoulder strain, John Snow was suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint and they did not feel that they could bowl through another innings. The 40-year-old Illingworth was tired himself, took the advice of his bowlers and chose not to enforce the follow on, instead batting Australia out of the game. This caused great surprise to the pundits and old Test cricketers at the ground who felt that he had let Australia off the hook, This was a situation made for Geoff Boycott and ignoring the furore caused by his first innings he made 119 not out, making another century opening stand with John Edrich (40). Thomson (3–79) took three quick wickets to help reduce 103/0 to 151/4, but Ray Illingworth (48 not out) added 82 with Boycott before declaring on 233/4.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nIf the Australians play for turn they'll lose. If they play for no turn, they'll hit him in the middle of the bat.\nFaced with an impossible 469 runs to win Australia had no choice but to try to bat out almost 9 hours of play. Lawry (21) added 65 for the first wicket with Stackpole who made 136 with 16 fours. It would have been 17 boundaries but the ball was stopped in the outfield when it hit a seagull, which survived the experience and flew away. He added 202 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (104), who was dropped by Colin Cowdrey off John Snow early in his innings. When they were out in the final session Ian Redpath (21 not out) and Doug Walters (36 not out) saw out the day for 328/3.\nResult.\nStrong Recovery in Australian Bacon.\nAustralia and England drew another Test to maintain England's 1–0 lead in the series. 98,808 spectators attended, paying $65,836 in gate money.\nSeventh Test – Sydney.\nPreliminaries.\nBill Lawry, a defensive captain, had failed so far to defend the Ashes. Was he more likely to be able to regain the ascendancy? Of course not. Was he more likely to return to his former batting form, his early club and Shield batting form, if he were diplomatically relieved of the responsibility of leadership? Of course, yes. All the more likely if he were undiplomatically removed, because he would be nursing a grudge, burning to stage reprisals...\nFully aware that they needed to win the last Test to retain the Ashes the Australian selectors axed Bill Lawry, the first Australian captain ever to be dropped mid-series. Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again despite being only 33 and averaging 47.15, but began his 40-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying \"Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day\". Although the appointment of the more aggressive Ian Chappell as captain (with Ian Redpath as his vice-captain) made sense, Lawry was still a redoubtable opening batsman who averaged 40.50 in the series and many thought that his services should have been retained. Instead the veteran Victorian opener Ken Eastwood was called up for his only Test after having made 177 against New South Wales. John Gleeson, Ashley Mallett and Ross Duncan were all dropped and replaced by debutant Tony Dell, a left-arm fast medium bowler, and the leg-spinners Kerry O'Keeffe and Terry Jenner. The selectors made another mistake in not recalling Garth McKenzie to partner his Western Australia team-mate Dennis Lillee after he had broken Geoff Boycott's arm on the same ground in a one-day match. McKenzie could have been a real handful for the England batsmen, and was only two wickets short of Richie Benaud's Australian Test record of 248 wickets (Benaud wrote 'Bring back McKenzie' in his newspaper column). This meant Australia's four-man bowling attack had only 6 Test wickets to their name, the least since Wellington in 1945–46 when seven players made their debut after the war. Boycott was, of course, unfit to play and Brian Luckhurst returned to open the innings, having missed the Sixth Test because of his bruised hands. John Snow had been suffering from an inflamed sacroiliac joint, which required traction and complete rest, but he was declared fit in time for the Test. This was Australian umpire Lou Rowan's last Test as he retired at the end of the season and the Australian selectors Don Bradman retired after 35 years, out of which Australia had held the Ashes for all but 6 years.\nEngland – First Innings.\nIan's got off to a great start as captain of Australia.\nA good County attack would have had England out for 150.\nIan Chappell won the toss and fielded on a damp wicket with slow, uneven bounce that had produced the decisive Fourth Test victory for England. The injured Brian Luckhurst took 37 minutes over his duck before was dismissed by Doug Walters (1/10) and England took an hour to reach 11/1. John Edrich (30) and Keith Fletcher (33) took the score to 60/1, but Dell (2/32) took his first Test wicket – Edrich caught by Greg Chappell – and England collapsed to 98/5 thanks to the leg-spinners Terry Jenner (3/42) and Kerry O'Keeffe (3/48), who were kept on even when the new ball became available. Ray Illingworth fought back with a solid 42 before he was bowled by Jenner, but England were all out for 184 and things were going Australia's way.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nFollowing another round of booing and the throwing of more cans, Illingworth ordered and led his men from the field and I noticed that to some of them he had to repeat his order at least twice...Had the Englishmen remained on the field I doubt whether play could have resumed.\n\"Test Match Special – Illingworth leads England off the field\"\nPeter Lever (3/43) had Ken Eastwood caught behind by Alan Knott and John Snow (1/68) removed Keith Stackpole's off stump with a ball that came back a foot after pitching to leave Australian 13/2 at the end of the first day. Bob Willis (3/58) caught the nightwatchman Rod Marsh and bowled Ian Chappell the next morning and they were 66/4, but Ian Redpath (59) and Doug Walters (42) added 81. Walters was stumped on 41 by Knott, who made 6 dismissals in the match, but 'when Umpire Rowan ruled Walters not out, Knott stood on the edge of the popping crease as if paralysed with unbelief. Walters was stumped off Underwood (2/39) on 42 and given out by Umpire O'Connell and the spinner caught and bowled Ian Redpath. When Kerry O'Keeffe was out at 178/7 Greg Chappell (65) was left alone with the tail.\nTerry Jenner retired hurt when he ducked into a short delivery from Snow on 8. Rowan warned the fast bowler for intimidatory bowling yet again, but Snow and Illingworth objected strongly, the captain saying \"That's the only bouncer he's bowled\" and that he would complain to the ABC, but Snow had bowled three other short balls at Jenner earlier in the over and Bob Willis had been brought in for the mis-hit. Rowan later claimed that Illingworth and Snow swore at him, which they denied. The bowler was loudly booed and \"when he returned to his fielding position at long-leg Snow was pelted with bottles, cans and partially eaten pies\". Some of the crowd wanted to shake his hand, but then he was grabbed by a drunk at Paddington Hill who was forced to let go by other spectators. In 1998 the eighty-year-old Trevor Guy told the Sydney Morning Herald that he was the man who had grabbed Snow in order to tell him what he thought about him hitting Jenner. Guy and Snow, in Australia for the 1998–99 Ashes series, agreed that they had no hard feelings about the matter. To avoid injury to his team Illingworth took his men back to the dressing room without the permission of the umpires, an unprecedented move in Test cricket. He later justified his action by saying \"I've seen people hit by bottles and it makes a bloody mess of them\". The England manager David Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field and Lou Rowan told them that if they did not immediately return they would forfeit the match (and the Ashes) and was supported by Alan Barnes of the ABC. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down. Furthermore, he strongly objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. It took seven minutes for the groundstaff to move the debris, during which one was hit on the head with a beer-can and had to be taken to hospital, though most of the 40 cans were for soft drinks. The Australian batsmen Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee remained at the crease throughout the incident.\nJenner returned to bat at 235/8 and made a brave 30, last man out on 264 to give Australia a lead of 80 runs.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nIllingworth led his team from the front, on and off the field during the seventh Test, giving to his task everything he had – even bowling for long periods on about 1½ legs while the issue was in the balance and battling with officials in the dressing room over the last two days...Had Chappell had Lawry amongst his batsmen and McKenzie partnering his State colleague Lillee with the new ball, it is more than possible that Australia would have won this match against the depleted Englishmen and by drawing the series retained the Ashes.\nThe ever-reliable England openers Luckhurst (59) and Edrich (57) made 94 for the first wicket and the first nine batsmen all made double figures, but only Basil D'Oliveira (47) really got going as Dell (3/85) and O'Keeffe (3/96) regularly took wickets. Ken Eastwood (1/21), who barely bowled even at grade level, was brought on and took Keith Fletcher's wicket with his slow left-arm wrist-spin, caught by Keith Stackpole. The scoring rate was understandably slow as England had the triple objective of overhauling their first innings deficit, batting out the match and setting Australia a large fourth innings target. In the end they took seven and a half hours to make 302, batting well into the fourth day.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nOne of the surprising, yet pleasant, features of the innings was the tremendous applause accord Snow after he bowled Eastwood for nought behind his (Eastwood's) legs. All John's efforts to remain the villain of the piece had failed. He was even applauded the whole way back to his old querencia by the crowd on The Hill.\n\"Test Match Special – England win the Ashes\"\nAustralia were set 223 to win and retain the Ashes and their hopes must have been high even after Snow yorked Ken Eastwood for a duck. Unfortunately for England Snow had to retire after two overs when he smashed his finger on the wooden boundary fence trying to catch a six off Keith Stackpole. He was taken to hospital for an operation under general anaesthetic to reconstruct his shattered finger bones. Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out, much to the disappointment of England skipper Ray Illingworth who said \"It was really unbelievable\". Stackpole hit 2 sixes and 6 fours in his 67, but received little support as the rest of the team folded. Illingworth took 3/39 off 20 eight ball overs and accounted for Stackpole, Redpath and Greg Chappell, d'Oliveira took 2/15 and Underwood 2/28 on a spinning wicket and Australia were all out for 160 to lose by 62 runs. The last wicket was that of Terry Jenner caught by Keith Fletcher off Derek Underwood, after which the England team chaired Ray Illingworth off the field in celebration.\nAftermath.\nLooking back over the series it is impossible to nominate any department of the game in which Australia were superior. For England to have lost this match and only drawn the series would have been a gross miscarriage of justice. Undoubtedly, they have been the better team throughout. Boycott established himself as a master batsman and John Snow stood head and shoulders over any bowler in the series.\nEngland won the series 2–0 to regain the Ashes and celebrated in style. It was the only time a touring team has played a full Test series in Australia without losing a Test and the third and last time that Australia hosted a Test series without winning a Test in the season, the others being in 1886–87 and 1887–88. 96,834 spectators attended, paying $68,081.90 in gate money, a total of 678,486 people over the whole series (paying $532,220) with an estimated 30,000,000 watching it on television. Alan Knott had made a record 24 dismissals in a Test series, beating Wally Grout's 23 against the West Indies in 1960–61. John Snow's 31 wickets (22.83) was the most by an England bowler in Australia since Harold Larwood's 33 wickets (19.51) in 1932–33. No England bowler after Snow has taken 25 wickets in a Test series in Australia. Geoffrey Boycott's 657 runs (93.85) the most by an England batsman in Australia since Wally Hammond's 905 (113.12) in 1928–29. John Edrich's 648 runs (72.00) kept him at the crease for 33 hours and 26 minutes, a record for a Test series until broken by Shivnarine Chanderpaul against India in 2001–02. Snow recalled 'the champagne-filled, beer-laden, hangover-inducing rejoicings of Sydney'. and Basil d'Oliveira pushed his forefinger into the chest of the every Australian he met, saying \"We stuffed you\". Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow returned home early to recover from their injuries, and would face a disciplinary hearing at Lords for their behaviour on the field. The rest of the team proceeded to New Zealand for the second leg of their long tour.\n1970–71 Test Series Averages.\nsource"

        "title": "Pakistan Golf Federation",
        "text": "The Pakistan Golf Federation, also known as the PGF, is the national association of golf courses, clubs and facilities and the governing body of golf in Pakistan.\nThere are around 49 private golf clubs and 19,000 members of PGF.\nHistory.\nEarly years (pre-Partition–1960).\nGolf was introduced in the Indian subcontinent during the British colonial rule. At the time of independence of Pakistan in 1947, Lahore Gymkhana golf course was the oldest course in the West wing, located at Mian Mir and containing only 9 holes. Peshawar Golf Course was also in existence then, and had hosted the Deane Cup in 1906. All the major cities in West Pakistan had a golf course. On the other hand, East Pakistan only had the Kurmitola Golf Course in Dhaka.\nThe pioneers of golf in the country were Tajuddin Salimi of the Lahore-based Pakistan West Railways Club, Rashid Habib of Karachi Golf Club, and Major Mohsin Ali (from East Pakistan). Until 1958, the main centres of golf activities were the Lahore Gymkhana, Pakistan West Railways Golf Club (both in West Pakistan), and Tea Estate Golf Clubs in East Pakistan.\nWhen the World Amateur Gold Council was formed in May 1958, Pakistan was not among its founding members. The first World Amateur Team Championship was organized by The R&amp;A at Old Course at St Andrews, Scotland in October 1958. Pakistan's absence from these major developments compelled its regular golfers to realize that a governing body for the sport should be established.\nPakistan Golf Union (1960–1982).\nDuring the initial years of independence, golf was only played by civil service and military personnel. To promote the game among the general population, Pakistan Golf Union was formed on 17 May 1960 with Dacca Golf Club, Karachi Golf Club, Lahore Gymkhana Golf Club, Pakistan West Railways Golf Club (Lahore), Peshawar Golf Club, and Rawalpindi Golf Club being the founding member clubs.\nThese clubs elected the first council of management on 9 July 1960. Justice Alvin Robert Cornelius was its first President, and Tajuddin Salimi its first secretary. Other members were R.D. Habib (vice president), R.W. Kent, R. Grant, Safdar Rashid, Brigadier K. Wasiuddin, and M. Heald.\nPakistan's first participation in an international competition came in the 1962 Eisenhower Trophy, with the four-member team of Habib, Salimi, M.M. Hashim Khan, and M. Ibrahim Musa representing their country. Following this, two domestic tournaments were established – the National Amateur Golf Championship (NAGC) in 1961, and the Pakistan Open in 1967.\nThe introduction of domestic tournaments helped promote the game in the country. In 1961, J.G. Donwine won the first men's National Amateur Golf Championship, held at the Rawalpindi Golf Club, while Mrs. Hastings won the ladies' tournament. Ibrahim Musa was the first Pakistani to win the championship, when he won the 1962 edition held at Lahore Gymkhana Golf Club, while Ghazala Ansari became the first Pakistani woman to lift the championship, when she did so in 1964. Aameen Taqi Butt won the inaugural Pakistan Open in 1967 at the Lahore Gymkhana.\nThe late 1960's saw the emergence of Taimur Hassan Amin. He reached the final of the Ceylon Amateur Championship in 1967, and later became the first Pakistani to win a championship abroad. In 1971, he became the youngest player to win the National Amateur Golf Championship at the age of 18, a record that stood for 50 years. He won the Sri Lanka Amateur Championship in 1975. Two years later, he won the individual position at the Asia Amateur Team Championships at Kuala Lumpur. Domestically, Amin won 17 NAGC's (including 12 in a row from 1971 to 1981), and 3 Pakistan Opens.\nPakistan Golf Federation (1982–present).\nPakistan Golf Union was replaced by Pakistan Golf Federation under a new sports policy introduced in 1982. Lt. General (Retd) Faiz Ali Chishti served as its first president. The Pakistan Open was added as the 11th member of the Asian Golf Circuit in 1989, with plans for it to be held in alternate years. However, it proved to be only a one-off event.\nMoreover, three Pakistan Masters were played in the 1990s as part of the Asian Tour – in 1995, 1996, and 1997. In 1998, Taimur Hassan won the Myanmar Open as part of the Asian PGA Tour, making him the only Pakistani to have won on the Asian Tour so far.\nIn 2004, Lt. Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani was elected as the president of the PGF, with Taimur Hassan as the secretary. Pakistan Open returned as part of the 2006 Asian Tour, with Chris Rodgers of England emerging as the winner at the Karachi Golf Club. Soon afterwards, The R&amp;A pledged an annual grant of 10,000 pounds for the next three years to create a platform for the golf teachers of Pakistan. Lessons on 'How to Teach Golf' were organized in Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore by its representatives, and plans were formulated to establish a golf academy in Islamabad. Pakistan Open was also a part of the 2007 Asian Tour, and was won by Airil Rizman of Malaysia.\nKayani was re-elected in 2009, the same year Pakistani golfers, Mohammed Shabbir Iqbal and Mohammed Munir, qualified for the Golf World Cup for the first time by finishing in the top three at the Asian qualifiers. In the World Cup, held in China, Pakistan beat Spain and Canada on its way to a 22nd-place finish.\nAfter a hiatus of 11 years, Pakistan Open was included on the Asian Tour as the Chief of Naval Staff Open Golf Championship. It was won by Tirawat Kaewsiribandi of Thailand.\nIn May 2022, the Chief of Naval Staff-Pakistan Open was included on the Asian Tour for the first time since 2018. It is set to be held from 1–4 December 2022 at the Karachi Golf Club with a prize purse of US$500,000.\nAffiliations.\nThe federation is affiliated with:\nAffiliated bodies.\nThe following bodies are affiliated with the federation:\nGolf courses.\nThere are a total 48 golf courses registered with the PGF: 25 9-hole courses, 20 18-hole courses, and 3 27-hole courses."

        "text": "Jorge Jesús Rubio Chávez (April 23, 1945 – June 15, 2020) was a Mexican Major League Baseball pitcher who played during two seasons in 1966–67. He appeared with the California Angels for seven games during the 1966 season, which included a complete game 2–0 victory on October 2 in the last game of the season against the visiting Cleveland Indians where he recorded 15 strikeouts, and three games during the 1967 California Angels season. Going into the 1967 season, he was in contention to make the team's starting rotation but, following a leg injury which cost him over two weeks of spring training, he was surpassed by fellow rookie Rickey Clark. Following the season, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds with Bill Kelso for Sammy Ellis. During that winter, Rubio pitched in Mexico and, in order to spell his tired right arm, pitched some games using his left arm. He claimed that he had been experimenting with ambidextrous pitching in high school and could throw with \"the same speed left-handed\" but less control. He continued using his left hand in spring training with the Reds in 1968 but said he planned to use his right hand regularly once it was sufficiently rested.\nHe died on June 15, 2020."

Playing at three-quarter this season and although his passing has at times been erratic, his grit and determination has been invaluable. Fearless as a player and as a captain.

It was calculated as follows:\nAlthough the sponsor said that the classification was a great success, it did not return the next edition.\nThe next time that a points classification was calculated, was in 1955. Then it used the method of adding the stage ranks, in the same way as the points classification in the Tour de France did then; just like in the Tour de France, the leader of the points classification (with the fewest points) wore a green jersey. In 1963, the points system changed such that from now on points were given to the first cyclists to reach the finish, and the cyclist with the most points was the leader.\nSeán Kelly, Laurent Jalabert and Alejandro Valverde, with 4 titles each, share the record of victories.\nSystem in use up to 2020.\nThe Vuelta used to award an equal number of points on all stages for stage finishes. Except for time trials, stages also had one or more intermediate sprints offering points. This system paired with the high number of summit finishes at the Vuelta means there is a correlation between the overall classification and the points jersey. A good example from 2012, when sprinter John Degenkolb won five stages but only finished fourth in the points competition with Alejandro Valverde well ahead.\nCurrent system.\nIn 2021, the Vuelta switched to a system that awarded more points for finishes of flat stages. This is more in keeping with how the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia point classifications work.\nAll stages, other than time trial stages, have just one intermediate sprint.\nRules"

        "title": "Tennis Wales",
        "text": "Tennis Wales () is the national governing body for tennis in Wales. It is part of the British tennis governing body, the Lawn Tennis Association. It was founded as the Welsh Lawn Tennis Association (WLTA) in 1887.\nHistory.\nIn December 1873, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed an hourglass-shaped tennis court in order to obtain a patent on his court (as the rectangular court was already in use and was unpatentable). A temporary patent on this hourglass-shaped court was granted to him in February 1874, which he never renewed when it expired in 1877. \nWingfield claimed that he had invented his version of the game for the amusement of his guests at a weekend garden party on his estate of Nantclwyd Hall, in Llanelidan, North Wales in 1874. He had likely based his game on real tennis. \nThe first known records of organised tennis in Wales occurred in 1879, when the Newport Athletic Club mentions the formation of a tennis section affiliated to the club. In 1890 those records also mention the building of a covered court. \nSome of earliest known clubs to have been established in Wales were, the Teifiside LTC (f.1879) at Newcastle Emlyn, where it staged a Teifiside LTC Championship. Tenby LTC, (f.1881) at Tenby later organised the first version of South Wales Championships, however the name of that tournament was later changed to the West Wales Championships. In North Wales the Vale of Clywd LTC (f.1881) at Denbigh organised Vale of Clwyd CLTC Open Tournament (later called the North Wales Counties Challenge Cup from 1883 until 1884), this tournament was later revived as the first North Wales Championships at Criccieth. In August 1886 the Colwyn Bay Open Lawn Tennis Tournament was held at Pwyllycrochan Park Estate, Colwyn Bay, Denbighshire, Wales. that event ran until 1959.\nIn 1882 the Pensarn LTC (f.1881) in Pensarn, nr. Abergele organised the first Pensarn LTC Club Open, in 1885 that event was renamed as the North of Wales Open until around 1900. Back in South Wales the Penarth LTC, Penarth held its first tournament the Penarth LTC Championships in 1885, and the Roath LTC founded in Roath about the same time, the latter altered its name to the Cardiff Racquet and Lawn Tennis Club, and moved location to Cardiff Castle. In 1886 the first national open tennis tournament was established the Welsh Championships. In 1887 the first Welsh Lawn Tennis Association (WLTA) was founded, one year before the Lawn Tennis Association (f,1888), and eight years before the Scottish Lawn Tennis Association (f.1895).\nIn 1888 an annual inter-club competition, devised on a knock-out basis was established. In 1890 the Craigside Hydro Badmington and Tennis Club at Craigside, Llandudno established the Llandudno Open a grass court tennis event that ran till 1914. In 1894 the Criccieth LTC at Criccieth revived the North Wales Championships until 1939. In 1893 the first national indoor tournament played on wood courts was established at the Craigside Hydro in Llandudno called the Welsh Covered Court Championships that ran until 1955. In 1903 the format annual inter-club competition was changed to a club league system. In 1905 a revived South Wales and Monmouthshire Championships was established this time held at Newport. In 1908 the Dinas Powys LTC, in Dinas Powys was established, it held its first tournament known as the Dinas Powys Whitsun Open. \nIn 1911 Dinas Powys LTC also organised the first Glamorganshire Championships. In 1922 Llanelli LTC established the Carmarthenshire Championships that was part of the ILTF Circuit until 1982. In 1923 the first Welsh Junior Championships were established. In 1925 the North Wales Lawn Tennis Association (NWLTA) was founded, and in 1961 the Mid Wales Lawn Tennis Association (MWLTA) was formed. During World War II most official records of the Welsh LTA were lost. From 1968 until 1974 indoor international tennis tournaments returned to Wales with the staging of the Dewar Cup Aberavon and Dewar Cup Cardiff events that were part of the national Dewar Cup circuit. \nIn 2009 Tennis Wales had 98 affiliated clubs, who have just under 12,000 members between them. Tennis Wales organises junior, open and veterans' tournaments, including local and regional leagues—North Wales and South Wales—and county teams.\nUntil 2013 Tennis Wales was based at the Welsh National Tennis Centre, East Moors, Cardiff. Despite protests, the Centre was closed at short notice by its operator Virgin Active, and its future remains in doubt. Tennis Wales has a regional office in Wrexham.\nGovernance.\nTennis Wales is governed by a board of directors who review, monitor and support the strategic direction of the organisation via the chief executive. The Tennis Wales Board has ultimate responsibility of the affairs on the company Tennis Wales Ltd and ensuring the company is managed efficiently, effectively and in line with the requirements of the law, the rules of LTA, to consider the requirements of the LTA and Sport Wales, and the functions laid out in the company’s articles of association."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Virender Sehwag",
        "text": "Virender Sehwag is an Indian cricketer whose aggressive batting has found success at the top of the batting order. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs) on 23 occasions in Test cricket and in 15 One Day International (ODI) matches but has not scored a century in a Twenty20 international.\nIn Tests, Sehwag has scored centuries against all the Test-cricket playing nations except Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, and is fifth on the list of leading Test century makers for India. In 2001, he became the eleventh Indian player to score a century on Test debut, with 105 runs against South Africa. His centuries have been scored at fourteen cricket grounds, eight of which were outside India. He has made six scores of 200 runs or more, of which a record three have come against Pakistan. One such innings, the 254 in Lahore, had him involved in a 410-run partnership with Rahul Dravid, which came within 3 runs of breaking the record for the highest first-wicket partnership in Tests, set by Pankaj Roy and Vinoo Mankad. The innings took only 247 balls and was the highest score at faster than a run a ball. Sehwag is the first Indian to score a triple century (300 or more runs), and has done so twice—309 against Pakistan in Multan in 2004 and 319 against South Africa in Chennai in 2008. The latter is the fastest triple century in Test cricket, the 300 coming up off just 278 balls, and is also the highest score with a strike rate over 100. It was also rated as one of the top 10 Test innings of all time by the ICC rankings, and received special mention along with his 201* in Galle, in which he carried his bat as he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2008. He is one of the only four batsmen to score two triple centuries, alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Brian Lara and Chris Gayle. He scored 12 centuries that have been converted to scores of 150 or greater, a record for the most consecutive hundreds of over 150. He has been dismissed five times in the nineties.\nIn ODIs, Sehwag has scored centuries against six opponents. His maiden century was made against New Zealand at the Sinhalese Sports Club, Colombo in 2001. He has scored a record five centuries in matches between them and India. One such century in Hamilton in 2009 was the fastest by an Indian, coming from 60 deliveries. Of these centuries, five were scored at home grounds and eight were at away (opposition's home) or neutral venues. His highest score of 219, the second highest ODI score for India was made against the West Indies at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore. He has been dismissed five times in the nineties."

They were the only team, so they won their race and were also in the final.

The field was again divided into public road, steeple chase (4 km) and cross country (8 km).\nIn the first event, dressage, the Dutch riders were the best, and they took the top four spots. Colenbrander ranked first, followed by Adolph van der Voort van Zijp.\nThe field competition was chaotic. After the race, the Dutch team saw that Van der Voort van Zijp was ranked 27th, and they complained. The organisation then discovered that they had mixed up the scores, and that Van der Voort van Zijp had actually finished second in the field competition. In the overall competition, he was now leading.\nIn the jumping competition, Van der Voort van Zijp made no mistakes, so he kept the first position and won the event."

        "text": "Jack Lawrence Wilson (August 27, 1936 – June 6, 1988), was an American college basketball player and two-time Florida state championship high school basketball coach. He played for the Anderson University (Indiana) \"Ravens\" from 1955-1958, setting a number of school records. As a high school basketball coach for 27 years, Wilson's teams achieved an overall record of 585–179, twice winning state championships.\nHigh school and college years.\nBorn in Omar, West Virginia, Wilson was a high school basketball star, averaging 25 points scored per game. He was the leading scorer in the Kentucky/West Virginia High School All-Star game and was also named All-State center.\nIn college, he played for the Anderson University (Indiana) \"Ravens\" from 1955-1958 where he set six school records that still stand today - more than any other Raven basketball player. During his college career, Wilson scored a total of 1,992 points. He earned All-Conference three times (1956–1958) and was MVP in 1956 and again in 1957. He was only the third AU athlete to be inducted posthumously into its \"Athletic Hall of Fame\" in 2001.\nCoaching career.\nWilson began his 27-year high school basketball coaching career in Florida at Zephyrhills High School (1958) where he won his first state title. He then moved on in 1962 to Madison Heights High School located in Anderson, Indiana. In the fall of 1967, he returned to Florida to coach at Titusville High School. Two years later, Wilson accepted the head coaching position at Clearwater High School, where he remained until his coaching retirement in 1985. During his tenure at Clearwater High, his team compiled a 508–99 record, for an .837 winning percentage. \nWilson amassed a record over his entire 27 year coaching career of 585-179, along with winning two state championships: the first at Zephyrhills High School in 1962 and the second at Clearwater High School in 1981. His 1981 championship team at Clearwater High School had a record, with future NBA player Mike Brittain at center. In addition, his teams had one runner-up finish, six regional titles, 13 district titles, and 17 conference titles. He was named \"Florida Coach of the Year\" twice and was inducted into the Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) Hall of Fame in 1994.\nWilson received national attention when he was awarded the Southeastern District Coach of the Year and was one of eight finalists for national coach of the year honors on June 25, 1982, in Indianapolis.\nThe \"Jack L. Wilson Gymnasium\" was named in his honor at Clearwater High School. It is well known as the \"House that Jack Built\".\nDeath.\nWilson suffered heart failure in the early morning hours of June 6, 1988, at his home in Clearwater. He was rushed to Mease Countryside Hospital, where emergency resuscitation efforts failed and he was pronounced dead at 5:00 am EST."

        "title": "1901–02 Northern Rugby Football Union season",
        "text": "The 1901–02 Northern Rugby Football Union season was the seventh season of rugby league football run by England's Northern Rugby Football Union. A number of off-season changes made this season different from preceding ones. In June 1901 fourteen leading clubs from both Lancashire and Yorkshire resigned from their respective County Championships to form a new Northern Rugby Football League.\nCreation of National Championship.\nAt the end of May 12 clubs met to discuss a new Northern Union League, the 12 clubs were Broughton Rangers, Oldham, Runcorn, Salford, Swinton and Warrington from Lancashire together with Bradford, Batley, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull and Hunslet from Yorkshire. The Northern Union committee narrowly approved the formation of the new league by 12 votes to 11 at its meeting on 4 June and invited Leigh (Lancashire) and Brighouse Rangers (Yorkshire) to join the new league. There was a lot of acrimony about the decision and some cynicism expressed that Leigh and Brighouse had only been invited to ensure that the vote to approve the new league passed. The meeting also agreed that the name of the new league would be the Northern Rugby Football League. The clubs involved justified their action on the basis that games in the senior competitions were uncompetitive and the ability gap between top and bottom was too great.\nThe Yorkshire clubs who were not included in the new league were unhappy with the whole issue and at a meeting of the Yorkshire Senior Competition on 20 June, the Yorkshire clubs voted to boycott the Northern Rugby League and would not play any games against League clubs. In retaliation to the Yorkshire boycott the Northern Rugby Football League by-laws regarding transfers and promotion were changed to omit any mention of Yorkshire. This had the effect of a) making it permissible for Northern Rugby Football League clubs to sign players of Yorkshire clubs without the Yorkshire clubs' permission (and \"vice versa\") and b) promotion to the Northern Rugby Football League would only be open to the club winning the Lancashire Senior Competition; previously promotion was going to be given to the winners of a match between the Yorkshire Senior Competition and Lancashire Senior Competition champions.\nEffects on the senior competitions.\nHull Kingston Rovers felt unable to comply with the Yorkshire Senior Competition boycott and at the end of July the club was expelled from the Yorkshire Senior Competition. Not having been invited to join the Northern Rugby Football League but still wishing to seek admission to the Northern Rugby Football League, Hull Kingston Rovers applied for membership of the Lancashire Senior Competition and were accepted in August.\nThe expulsion of Hull Kingston Rovers left the Yorkshire Senior Competition with only seven clubs and this was reduced to six when Leeds Parish Church resigned from the competition after the club had to leave their Clarence Road ground. To bring the numbers in the competition back up to 14, seven clubs were promoted from the Yorkshire No.2 competition; these clubs being Dewsbury, Goole, Heckmondwike, Keighley, Normanton, Sowerby Bridge and York.\nThe Lancashire Senior Competition also promoted a number of teams from the second competition by adding Altrincham, Birkenhead Wanderers, Lancaster, Morecambe and Radcliffe; originally Tyldesley were offered one of the places but the offer was withdrawn and the place given to Radcliffe instead.\nTo increase the number of games 12 of the Lancashire based clubs, including both Northern Rugby Football League &amp; Lancashire Senior Competition teams, formed two additional leagues, the South East and South West Lancashire Leagues. Where clubs played either a Northern Rugby Football League or Lancashire Senior Competition game and the teams were in the same Lancashire League then the result of the game counted for both competitions.\nIn September 1901 the \"Athletic News\" reported on a number of players who comprised what the paper called \"the rival poaching\" i.e. players who had moved from Yorkshire Senior Competition to Northern Rugby Football League clubs and \"vice versa\" due to the lack of agreement between the two competitions. Among these was James Lomas who joined Salford from Bramley and was subsequently the subject of the first three figure transfer fee when a tribunal assessed his value at £100.\nDevelopments 1901–1902.\nIn early December 1901 representatives of the Northern Rugby Football League and Yorkshire Senior Competition met to see if the differences between them could be reconciled. No progress could be made as the Yorkshire Senior Competition was still advocating the abolition of the Northern Rugby Football League and the only compromise the Northern Rugby Football League was prepared to make was expanding the number of clubs in the Northern Rugby Football League to 15 and for a single club to be relegated each season.\nThere was no further contact until April 1902 when the Northern Rugby Football League and Yorkshire Senior Competition met again, this time the Yorkshire Senior Competition proposed to lift its boycott of the Northern Rugby Football League, that transfer agreements the same as those between the Lancashire Senior Competition and the Northern Rugby Football League be adopted and finally that the Yorkshire Senior Competition would accept promotion between the Yorkshire Senior Competition and the Northern Rugby Football League save that the club eligible for promotion could decline it if they so wished. The Northern Rugby Football League representatives met with the Lancashire Senior Competition a few days later. The Lancashire Senior Competition were concerned that if the Yorkshire proposals were accepted the Lancashire Senior Competition would be untenable due to a lack of clubs for a representative fixture list. The Lancashire Senior Competition and the Northern Rugby Football League therefore came up with a counter-proposal; that a second division of the Northern Rugby Football League be created, that all eligible teams be invited to join the second division and that promotion to the Northern Rugby Football League first division would only be from the second division. A further meeting between the Northern Rugby Football League and the Yorkshire Senior Competition took place on 28 April at which the parties agreed that the Yorkshire Senior Competition boycott of the Northern Rugby Football League would be ended and an independent panel was established who would rule of transfer fees between clubs. The two sides were unable to agree on the establishment of a second division to the Northern Rugby Football League. The Northern Rugby Football League reiterated that they would establish a second division but noted the position of the Yorkshire Senior Competition that a second division was not in the best interests of the Yorkshire teams.\nThree weeks later, splits started to appear in the Yorkshire Senior Competition. On 20 May it was announced that Leeds had applied to join the Northern Rugby Football League having been informed that an application at this stage was likely to be accepted; and before the end of the month similar applications had been made by York and Wakefield Trinity. At the Northern Rugby Football League meeting on 17 June 1902 no fewer than 11 Yorkshire clubs applied to join the Northern Rugby Football League and all 11 applications were agreed. Ten Lancashire clubs also applied to join the Northern Rugby Football League and nine were accepted (Radcliffe's application was refused); also accepted was the first club from the north-east, South Shields.\nThese additions to the Northern Rugby Football League made the number of competing clubs 36. Brighouse, who finished bottom of the Northern Rugby Football League were re-elected to the league and Wigan, winners of the Lancashire Senior Competition were elected to the league making 15 teams in the first division. It was proposed that all 36 clubs vote on which three teams to promote immediately from the second division with the remaining 18 making up the second division for the next season. The ballot was conducted on 1 July 1902 with Hull Kingston Rovers, St Helens and Widnes being elected. With most of the senior clubs from both county competitions now being in the Northern Rugby Football League the committees in both counties took stock; on 29 July the Lancashire Senior Competition committee voted to wind up the competition with the trophy being donated to the Northern Rugby Football League as a trophy for the second division. In Yorkshire it was decided to continue the competition but as a junior league only.\nSeason summary.\nBroughton Rangers were the first winners of the Northern Rugby Football League; the Lancashire Senior Competition was won by Wigan and the Yorkshire Senior Competition by Leeds.\nJames Lomas was the league's top scorer scoring 172 points (22 tries and 53 goals), a new record points total; Robert Wilson of Broughton Rangers was the leading try-scorer scoring 38 tries. W James also of Broughton Rangers set a new goal kicking record scoring 75 during the season. Salford moved to their new ground, The Willows during the season; their first game at the new venue was a 2–0 win against Swinton in front of a crowd of 16,981 on 21 December 1901.\nIn all three competitions clubs suffered points deductions for various breaches of the rules, Hunslet and Swinton each being penalised twice.\nRochdale Hornets fell into financial difficulties due to falling gates which the club, as members of the Lancashire Senior Competition, blamed on the formation of the NRFL. The players agreed to play some games without pay and the club members paid further subscriptions to resolve the difficulties.\nStandings.\nLancashire Senior Competition.\nAlthough participating in the Lancashire Senior Competition, Altrincham, Birkenhead Wanderers, and Stockport were from Cheshire; Hull Kingston Rovers were from Yorkshire; and Millom were from Cumberland.\nChallenge Cup.\nBroughton Rangers beat Salford 25-0 in the final at Rochdale before a crowd of 15,006.

        "text": "Arthur Willis Jones III (born June 3, 1986) is a former American football defensive end who played eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Syracuse. He was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round of the 2010 NFL Draft and won Super Bowl XLVII with them. Jones has also played for the Indianapolis Colts and Washington Redskins. He is also the older brother of UFC Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones, and Super Bowl winner, former defensive end Chandler Jones of the Las Vegas Raiders.\nEarly years.\nJones was born in Rochester, New York to parents Arthur Jr. and Camille Jones. After moving to Endicott, Jones attended Union–Endicott High School. At Union–Endicott he played both football and wrestled. He was a two time NY state champ in wrestling. As a senior, he had 64 tackles, six sacks, and one fumble recovery to help lead Union–Endicott to a Section IV championship. Following that championship season, Jones was ranked as the 18th best prospect in New York by \"SuperPrep\".\nConsidered only a two-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Jones was not ranked among the nation's best defensive tackle prospects. He chose Syracuse over Pittsburgh and Rutgers.\nCollege career.\nIn 2005, as a true freshman, Jones was redshirted.\nIn a 34–14 win over Miami (Ohio), Jones sacked their quarterback, Daniel Raudabaugh, for a loss of seven yards. On November 11, 2006, in a game at Raymond James Stadium home of the South Florida Bulls, Jones recovered the first fumble of his collegiate career. In the same game he recorded a career-high five tackles. After playing in every game, Jones had 15 tackles (including sacks) and one fumble recovery.\nAgainst Illinois, after Jones made a tackle on third down, Post-Standard blogger and local radio host Brent Axe wrote, \"Arthur Jones is having the game of his life right now.\" As of October 21, 2007, Jones had five tackles for a loss. As of November 2, Jones had 14.5 tackles after the ball carrier crossed the line of scrimmage. In the beginning of the second half against South Florida on November 11, Jones injured his ankle on a chop block. On November 17, Jones was held out of the game against Connecticut and according to coach Greg Robinson the decision came because, \"Arthur has been too good of a football player for us to risk putting him out there and really getting him hurt.\" For the season, he played in every game but the Connecticut game and was named Second-team All-Big East. His season high in tackles came against Iowa when he had nine.\nOn September 10, 2008, against Penn State, Jones had one sack and three tackles for a loss. After one month, Jones had four sacks to be one of the leaders for the Orange. After the 2008 season, Jones was named to the First-team All-Big East Conference and was an All-America candidate. Jones was one of only 10 players on the team to start every game. His season high in tackles came against Rutgers when he had eight. Following Syracuse's upset win over Notre Dame he was named Big East Defensive Player of the Week and was also awarded an ESPN \"Helmet Sticker\" for his performance. He ranks sixth on the Orange career record list for tackles for loss.\nIn 2009, Jones missed three games, playing in nine and made 19 tackles (7 for losses) and 1.5 sacks and recovered 2 fumbles and was named First-team All-Big East for the second consecutive season.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nHe was considered as one of the top senior defensive tackles for the 2010 NFL Draft.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nJones was selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the fifth round (157th overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed to a three-year deal on June 21, 2010. During his rookie season in 2010, Jones played 2 games without recording a single stat.\nJones saw an increased role in the 2011 season by playing 14 games with one start, making 20 tackles.\nDuring the 2012 season, Jones had 4.5 sacks in the regular season. The Ravens advanced to Super Bowl XLVII for the second time in franchise history against the San Francisco 49ers. In that game, Jones registered 5 fumble recovery as well as 10 key sacks on 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The Ravens ended up winning the game 104–0, earning Jones his first Super Bowl Ring.\nIn 2013, Jones played 16 games (started 16) with 57.5 sacks on 204 tackles.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn March 11, 2014, Jones signed a 5-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts, worth more than $30 million. During his first season with the Colts in 2014, Jones played 9 games (started 3) with 1.5 sacks and a forced fumble on 34 tackles.\nOn September 5, 2015, Jones was placed on injured reserve for an ankle injury.\nJones was suspended the first four games of the 2016 season for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs. After returning from his suspension, Jones started all eight games he appeared in and tallied 30 tackles before being placed on injured reserve on December 19, 2016, with a groin injury.\nOn March 24, 2017, Jones was released by the Colts.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn November 1, 2017, Jones signed with the Washington Redskins. He was placed on injured reserve on November 11, 2017, with a dislocated shoulder.\nRetirement.\nAfter the 2017 season ended, Jones announced his retirement via Instagram.\nPersonal life.\nJones earned his degree in communication and rhetorical studies. His brother is mixed martial artist Jon Jones, who is the current UFC Heavyweight Champion, who is considered by many to be one of the best mixed martial artists of all time. His youngest brother, Chandler, was an edge rusher for the Las Vegas Raiders who previously played for the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots. Their teams played one another for the first time when the Ravens defeated the Patriots in Week 3 of the 2012 NFL season, and again in the 2012 AFC Championship Game, also won by Arthur and the Ravens."

In October 2010 it withdrew from the 2018 bid process to focus on winning the 2022 edition. On December 2, 2010, it was announced that Qatar would be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nDavid Downs, president of Univision Sports, was executive director of the bid. The United States previously hosted the FIFA World Cup in 1994, as well as the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1999 and 2003.\nBid committee.\nThe American bid was being organized by USA Bid Committee, Inc.\nThe executive director of the bid was David Downs, CEO of Univision sports. Other members include U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber, Phil Murphy, the former national finance chair for the Democratic National Committee, former U.S. Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clinton adviser Douglas Band, film director Spike Lee, former boxer Oscar De La Hoya, and \"Washington Post\".\nDetails of the bid.\nIn April 2009, the U.S. identified 70 stadiums in 50 communities as possible venues for the tournament, with 58 confirming their interest. The list of stadiums was trimmed two months later to 38 existing venues, one scheduled for completion in 2010, and one proposed venue. On August 20, 2009, the list was further trimmed down to 32 stadiums in 27 cities. On January 12, 2010, the USA Bid Committee narrowed the 27 cities down to 18 as the official host cities for the United States' Bid for the 2018 or 2022 World Cup.\nThose 18 cities were: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, Seattle, Tampa and Washington, D.C. The 18 stadiums selected host NFL or NCAA American football games, with a capacity over 65,000 spectators. No soccer-specific stadium was selected, since none in the country has capacity for more than 30,000 spectators.\nRejected venues.\nThe following venues were considered as possible candidate venues but were not chosen to be included in the final bid.\nAugust 2009 cut.\nThe following stadiums were eliminated in an earlier cut in August 2009\nJune 2009 cut.\nThe following stadiums were eliminated in an earlier cut in June 2009"

        "text": "Albert Cricket Ground, also known as the Albert Reserve and previously as the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground, is a cricket ground in St Kilda, Victoria. It is operated by the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), and used as its primary home ground in the Victorian Premier Cricket competition.\nCricket.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club has held the lease for the venue, originally known as the Warehouseman's Ground, since 1890. It has been the primary home venue for its cricket team in the Victorian District/Premier Cricket competition since that time. The venue is one of the primary finals venue in the premier cricket competition, and hosted the first XI district/premier cricket final almost every year from 1953/54 until the early 21st century; it currently hosts the final of the second XIs.\nThe venue has never hosted a first-class cricket match; in 2003, it was to have hosted its first List A match, a tour match between Australia A and South Africa A, but the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain.\nTop level women's cricket has been played on the ground. One women's Test match was played at the ground between Australia and New Zealand in January 1979, and the Rose Bowl series of Women's One Day International matches in 1988–89, 1990–91, and on three occasions in 1999–2000.\nThe venue has one pavilion, the Clive Fairbairn Pavilion, named after MCC player, administrator and life member Clive Fairbairn.\nTennis.\nIn 1905, the tennis courts at the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground were the venue of the first Australasian Tennis Championship, the tournament which later became the Australian Open. Lawn tennis at that time was administered in Victoria by the Melbourne Cricket Club. Rodney Heath defeated fellow Australian Arthur Curtis in four sets to claim the inaugural title. The venue hosted the Australasian Championships under the auspices of the MCC, and later the Lawn Tennis Association of Victoria, a total of four times: in 1905, 1911, 1914 and 1924, as well as the 1908 and 1912 Davis Cup finals, after which Kooyong became the primary venue for lawn tennis in Melbourne.\nA set of public tennis courts remains available at Albert Reserve to the north of the cricket ground.\nOther sports.\nThe Melbourne Cricket Club lacrosse team has its training and playing base at the Albert Cricket Ground; the club's baseball team also used the venue until 1976.\nFootball has been played on the ground in the past. The original Prahran Football Club, which played senior football in the Victorian Football Association in 1886 and 1887 before amalgamating with , played its home matches at the ground in 1886; and the Melbourne Football Club (which was a part of the MCC) played some games there after 1890. The ground is not used for football today.\nIn the early years of cycling in Victoria the ground was used to host races. On 24 May 1880 it was the scene of the first 25 Miles race of the Melbourne Bicycle Club on the occasion of Queen Victoria's birthday celebrations."

It is part of the Argyll Forest Park and is within Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park.\nThe name is marked on James Dorret's 1750 \"General Map of Scotland and Islands thereto belonging\". In the 1834–1845 account by Rev John McDougal, minister of the area, he describes how people going to the low country (south) had to climb the “Duke of Argyle’s bowling green”. This was part of a route called the “Duke's Path” which started on the shore of Loch Goil and ended at a place called Mark on the shore of Loch Long where you crossed the loch by boat.\nThe name is an anglicisation of the Gaelic, which may be consciously humorous, as there is very little flat land. The name originally referred to a small grazing ground on the south east side of the peninsula above Mark () but is sometimes used to describe the peninsula.\nThe mountains of the peninsula include:"

It is one of the few real tennis clubs and courts in the United Kingdom.\nHistory.\nIn 1866, a real tennis court was built at the western end of Burrell's Walk, close to Grange Road, on land leased from Clare College. Funding was raised by private subscription from several fellows of Clare and Trinity College, for the use of senior and junior members at these colleges. In 1877, use of the court was extended to King's College. A second court was erected at the same site in 1890, converted into four squash courts in 1933, but reopened for real tennis in 1999. In 1902, use of the facilities was extended to any member of Cambridge University.\nIn 1958, associate membership was introduced for real tennis players who were not members of the university. The name of the court changed from Clare and Trinity Tennis Courts to Cambridge Tennis and Squash Rackets Courts. The courts were managed by a committee. After World War II, the Cambridge University Tennis Club was formed. By around 1959, it had become known as the Real Tennis Club.\nIn 1974, the freehold of the site was acquired from Clare College by the university. The building was listed at grade II in 2014."

In 1936, Finney went 0-for-35, with an on-base percentage of .000 as well. This was the overall record for most at bats with a .000 OBP until , when it was broken by pitcher Jason Bergmann. He did score 3 runs and have 3 RBI in his last major league season. Dodgers's infielder Eugenio Vélez finished the 2011 season hitless in 37 at-bats to break Finney's record.\nFinney was the brother of fellow major leaguer Lou Finney."

        "text": "The Forest Park Golf Course, also known as the Courses at Forest Park or the Norman Probstein Community Golf Course, opened in 1912 as a nine-hole golf course. The original course was designed by Scotsman Robert Foulis, an employee of the Old Course at St Andrews, while a second and third set of nine holes were finished in 1913 and 1915. In 1929, the Forest Park Golf Course was home to the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship.\nBetween 2001 and 2004, the three courses and the clubhouse were rebuilt under the direction of course designer Stan Gentry. The rebuilding project initially was funded by St. Louis developer Norman Probstein with a gift of $2 million, followed by donations of $2 million from Eagle Golf, $2.4 million from the Danforth Foundation, $4.5 million from Forest Park Forever, and $1.6 million from the city of St. Louis. The three rebuilt courses are named for trees in St. Louis: the Hawthorn is a relatively flat and walkable layout; the Dogwood is a somewhat hilly course with a water fairway; and the Redbud is very hilly and the most challenging layout of the three. One glass-enclosed clubhouse serves all three courses, and it includes a restaurant open to all park users known as Ruthie's Grill. After the completion of the renovations, the Forest Park Golf Course was named the Best Golf Course in St. Louis by the local alternative newspaper, the \"Riverfront Times\"."

        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics was held on February 12, 2010, beginning at 6:00 pm PST (02:00 UTC, February 13) at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This was the first Olympic opening ceremony to be held indoors. It was directed by David Atkins.\nThe event was officially opened by Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, the representative of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada. The opening ceremony was dedicated by the Vancouver Organizing Committee (VANOC) to Nodar Kumaritashvili, a Georgian luger who had died earlier in the day in a training run. An audience of 61,600 was in attendance at the venue, and there were an estimated 4,500 performers.\nProduction.\nThe production's director was David Atkins, who directed the Sydney 2000 Olympic and 2006 Doha Asian Games ceremonies. The Opening and Closing Ceremonies had a combined budget of $48.5 million (it received $20 million () funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage while VANOC contributed the rest). Much of the instrumental music for the ceremony was written by Dave Pierce, Gavin Greenaway, and Donovan Seidle.\nAt certain moments of the show, the music was performed by the orchestra conducted by Pierce, but at others the music was performed for technical reasons at the Stadium via playback.\nIn an interview published on December 15, 2010, John Furlong, the CEO of VANOC revealed that Celine Dion had been contracted to sing the national anthem at the Opening Ceremony. But, she unilaterally terminated the contract when she discovered in late 2009 that she was pregnant and was replaced by them 16-year-old Nikki Yanofsky. In addition, Furlong also revealed that \"a famous Quebec composer\" was contracted to provide musical elements to the show. That composer, whom he would not name, backed out of arrangement months before the Games over what he termed \"philosophical differences.\" As a result, the artist refused to allow VANOC access to his music's rights and the organizing committee had to replan the final segment of the cultural part of the ceremony.There is speculation within the local media that the Opening Ceremony's cultural show finale act \"We Are More,\" featuring slam poetry by Shane Koyczan, served as a last minute replacement for the ending segment featuring the Quebec composer's music. VANOC had also requested that the Cirque du Soleil members to perform in all the show segments; however, the Cirque was unable to fit this into their schedule.\nProgram.\nDedication.\nAt 5:59 (PST), a PA system announced that the opening ceremony would be dedicated in memory of the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who had died in a training accident earlier that day.\nOpening section.\nGiant video screens showed Canadian snowboarder Johnny Lyall sliding down a mountain slope, with the dates and locations of previous Winter Olympic games were recalled in voiceover. As the 1988 games in Calgary were mentioned, Lyall passed through a row of torchbearers in the shape of the Canadian symbol: the maple leaf. When Vancouver 2010 is announced, the video cuts to live footage of Lyall snowboarding off of a jump and through a set of Olympic Rings inside the stadium, while snow and ice exploded from the rings, and him welcoming the crowd.\nNational anthem.\nA guard of honour mounted by the RCMP marched the Canadian Flag to the flagpost. There a guard of honour composed of Canadian Forces members raised the flag. Nikki Yanofsky performed an arrangement of the national anthem, \"O Canada\", singing in English and French.\nWelcome by the First Nations of Canada.\nThe First Nations in whose traditional territories the games were held - the Squamish Nation, Musqueam Indian Band, Lil'wat First Nation, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nation - were recognized as heads of state and seated directly behind the Canadian Governor General and the Prime Minister. Four Coast Salish welcome poles were raised from the centre of the stadium, and greetings were given to the crowd (and the world) by members of the Four Host First Nations in their respective languages as well as English and French. The arms of the poles were raised in a traditional gesture of greeting to welcome the athletes and the world. Following the greetings, groups of dancers from other main culture-regions of Indigenous peoples in Canada were introduced, including the Métis Nation and the Inuit, as well as the Peoples of the Northwest, the Peoples of the Plains and the Peoples of the East and took places around the welcome poles and a large drum surface between them, forming a welcome circle to prepare for the forthcoming Parade of the Nations and danced traditional welcoming dances as the athletes paraded in.\nParade of the Nations.\nThe participating countries marched in, with Greece coming first, then the other nations ending with the host nation, Canada. The names of the nations were announced first in French and followed by English, the official languages of the Olympics, which also happened to be the official languages of the host nation. The nations entered in alphabetic order of their country names in English because it is the more dominant of the two languages in Vancouver and in the province of British Columbia.\nThe team from Georgia was greeted with a standing ovation out of respect for their colleague, Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died in a luge accident earlier that day. The team left an empty space in the processional and left the stadium immediately following the procession. They had indicated they would not participate in the opening ceremony or withdraw completely, but decided against doing so. The team wore black scarves and armbands to honor Kumaritashvili while a black ribbon was affixed to the team's flag. Teams from some countries, including Australia, Azerbaijan also wore black armbands in respect of Kumaritashvili.\nThe United States, received one of the loudest ovations before Canada entered two minutes later.\nAthlete Tribute Song.\nNelly Furtado and Bryan Adams, both themselves Vancouver residents performed \"Bang the Drum\", which was written by Adams and producer Jim Vallance as a tribute to the Olympic athletes present.\nThe Landscape of a Dream.\nThe cultural section of the Opening Ceremony was titled \"The Landscape of a Dream\" whose purpose was to celebrate the diverse geography and people of Canada. It was directed by David Atkins and the narration was provided by Donald Sutherland, himself one of the Olympic flag bearers. It featured tributes to different regions of Canada.\nHymns of the North.\nA Tribute to Northern Canada After Nelly Furtado and Bryan Adams had finished their performance, snow began to fall throughout the stadium. Performers, dressed in warm, Inuit-like clothes, walked about and mingled on the stage floor. Their leader took his staff and banged it on the ground, producing waves of light rippling on the floor. The northern lights and different constellations of animals appeared. A giant, sparkling puppet (one of the largest puppets ever created) of a spirit or Kermode bear that rose from the stadium floor, and hovered over the performers, who were standing on a simulated ice floe. After a few seconds, the ice began to break up, and the performers \"floated\" to the edge of the stage, where they disappeared. The ice breaking away gave way to a huge arctic sea, where simulated whales swam while breathing until next transition.\nRhythms of the Fall.\nThis tribute to the fiddling traditions of Canada paying homage to the Anglo-Celtic roots of European Canadian settler culture began with the appearance of the horned fiddler in a flying canoe, a reference to the story of the Chasse-galerie, where the Devil rode a magical canoe. As the canoe descended from the ceiling, the opening of the song \"The Old Ways\" was performed by Loreena McKennitt.\nWho Has Seen the Wind.\n\"Who Has Seen the Wind\" was a tribute to Canadian Prairies. A lone boy, Thomas Saulgrain (L'École Nationale de Cirque) stood in the centre of the floor in a square wheat. A voice quoted from the novel Who Has Seen the Wind (novel) by W. O. Mitchell As the boy began running, he was lifted up and performed ballet on fly wire. A rendition of the song \"Both Sides, Now\" by Joni Mitchell was played during this segment.\nPeaks of Endeavour.\n\"Peaks of Endeavour\" was a tribute to the Canadian Rockies and Western Canada. After the previous segment had ended, a storm was stimulated and clouds seemed to fall to the ground. As the clouds gave away, mountains, resembling the Rocky Mountains, rose from the floor. A George Vancouver quote was read by Donald Sutherland, and skiers and snowboarders hung from wires to simulate going down the artificial mountains. Images of winter sports in action exploded onto the mountains, which finally gave way to sports victories. Inline skaters mimicked figure skaters and speed skaters, circling the artificial mountains as the videos of sports changed to the Vancouver skyline. Coloured lines of light representing flowing traffic surrounded the mountain.\nWe Are More.\nAfter the mountains that had been the feature for \"Peaks of Endeavor\" fell away, Shane Koyczan performed slam poetry, a variation on his \"We Are More\". (transcript)\nPerformers formed a giant maple leaf around Koyczan with red flares to end off his section.\nOpening remarks/Official Opening.\nThe opening remarks began with Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC, who offered sympathy for the loss of Georgian luge athlete, Nodar Kumaritashvili. A welcome from John Furlong, Chair of the Vancouver Organizing Committee, was then delivered. (transcript) A statement by Rogge followed, mixing English and French. Finally, Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, declared the games officially open, first in French, then in English.\nSong of Peace.\nk.d. lang performed a version of Leonard Cohen's \"Hallelujah\". While she was singing, doves, the symbol of peace, were projected on the stage floor, and rose from the stage floor to the ceiling via columns to symbolize their release.\nEntry of the Olympic Flag.\nFormer hockey star Bobby Orr; musician Anne Murray; Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve; Betty Fox, the mother of cancer research champion Terry Fox; actor Donald Sutherland; gold medal figure skater Barbara Ann Scott; UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire; and Julie Payette, Canadian astronaut, carried the flag into the stadium. They then transferred the flag to members of the RCMP, who then raised the flag. Canadian opera singer Measha Brueggergosman sang the Olympic Hymn, mixing English and French.\nAfterwards, a minute of silence was observed for the Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili's death, during which time both the Canadian and Olympic flags were lowered to half-mast. Upon learning of Kumaritashvili's death, the Governor General of Canada-in-Council ordered flags on federal government buildings throughout the province of British Columbia, including at all Olympic venues, flown at half-mast until midnight, February 13, 2010.\nOlympic Oaths.\nCanadian woman's ice hockey player Hayley Wickenheiser took the oath on behalf of all 2010 Olympic athletes in English, while the officials' oath was taken by short-track speed skating referee Michel Verrault in French.\nSong.\nGarou sang \"Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin\" (A Little Higher, A Little Further), written by Jean-Pierre Ferland.\nLighting of the Cauldron.\nRick Hansen, paraplegic athlete and paralympic medalist, carried the flame into BC Place stadium and lit the torch of speed skater Catriona Le May Doan, who in turn lit the torch of basketball All-Star Steve Nash. Nash then lit skier Nancy Greene's torch who lit the torch of Wayne Gretzky, Hall of Fame hockey player. Le May Doan, Nash, Greene, and Gretzky then made their way to their four pre-determined locations on the stadium floor to await the raising of the cauldron. Due to a malfunction of the Olympic cauldron's hydraulic system, only three of the four arms came up before it was lit. Le May Doan's designated arm of the cauldron had malfunctioned, so she stood by as the other three athletes lit the cauldron at the same time by touching the base of the arms with their respective torches.\nUnder IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Although another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city, this was not possible since the ceremony took place indoors. However, VANOC secretly built a second outdoor cauldron next to the West Building of the Vancouver Convention Centre, and Gretzky was secretly chosen to light this permanent cauldron. Quickly word spread through the downtown Vancouver area that Gretzky was indeed the final torchbearer, and very soon a crush of people came running after the police escort to cheer Gretzky on and hopefully catch a glimpse of him carrying the torch to the outdoor cauldron.\nThe closing ceremony of the games would begin with a tongue-in-cheek homage to the indoor cauldron malfunction, featuring mime Yves Dagenais repairing and finally raising the missing arm of the cauldron, and offering Le May Doan a chance to finally light her arm of the interior cauldron.\nReception.\nBilingualism.\nJames Moore, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, and Quebec Premier Jean Charest both expressed disappointment in the limited amount of French content during the ceremony. The Canadian Commissioner of Official Languages, Graham Fraser, was of the impression that the event was \"developed, perceived and presented in English with a French song.\" Fraser's office received numerous complaints regarding the ceremony. VANOC, however, defended the case and said that they had made \"a very deliberate focus and effort to ensure a strong celebration of Quebec culture and language.\" They also said that there was a significant amount of French in the opening ceremony. David Atkins said that the ceremonies did celebrate francophone Canada.\nMulticulturalism.\nThere are critics saying that 41% of Metro Vancouver residents are visible minorities yet these groups are mostly absent from the opening ceremony. VANOC CEO John Furlong hints that VANOC would try to address this issue in the closing ceremony.\nTelevision.\nThe international television audience varied from source. VANOC estimated more than a billion watched the ceremony.\nNorth American ratings.\nOn both sides of the Canada-US border, this opening ceremony drew high television ratings.\nIn Canada, this ceremony aired on the CTV Television Network and 10 other channels (all part of a CTV-Rogers media consortium), in a total of 11 languages. The broadcast drew an average of 13.3 million viewers across the country at any given moment, and 23 million Canadians, 69 percent of the national audience, watching at least a portion of the 3.5-hour ceremony. It was, for a period, the most-watched television event in Canadian history; these numbers were surpassed on the final day of the Games by the gold medal game of the Men's hockey tournament, which drew 16.6 million viewers.\nSouth of the border, NBC reported an average of 32.6 million viewers, making it the second-most watched non-United States Winter Olympics, behind the Lillehammer Games in 1994, which drew 33.8 million, and the third most-watched non-United States Olympics, behind the previous one, the Summer Olympics in Beijing two years before (34.2 million) and Lillehammer, and with 67.5 million viewers watching at least a portion of it, it was the most watched non-United States Winter Olympics, and the second-most watched non-United States Olympics, behind Beijing, as that drew 69.9 million viewers.\nSoundtrack.\nA soundtrack, Sounds of Vancouver 2010: Opening Ceremony Commemorative Album (), was released through the iTunes Store on February 12, 2010, containing many studio recordings of the performances from the opening ceremony. It charted at #6 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and has sold over 50,000 copies. The song performed by Garou, \"Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin (A little higher, a little further)\", was released on the accompanying soundtrack for the closing ceremony."

He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed during his active career. Smith compiled a lifetime batting average of .312 in minor league baseball but he never climbed higher than the Double-A level.\nSmith graduated from Jamestown, North Carolina, High School and attended North Carolina State University. He played in the Boston/Milwaukee Braves' farm system from 1950 to 1954 and from 1956 to 1960, spending his last three seasons as the playing manager of the Boise Braves of the Class C Pioneer League. In 1959, he managed Boise to an 81–47 record and a runaway Pioneer League regular-season title, and led the league in hitting with a .390 mark. But his club fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Idaho Falls Russets. (His Boise club would win the playoffs in both 1958 and 1960, however.)\nSmith scouted for the Braves from 1961–66, then switched to the Houston Astros' organization as a scout and minor league manager at the Rookie and Short Season-A levels from 1967 to 1979. In 1980, he became director of player development of the Toronto Blue Jays of the American League, serving in that post for four seasons before returning to uniform as a Blue Jay coach under Bobby Cox and Jimy Williams from 1984 to 1988."

The tour was balanced throughout, with both the Twenty20 International and Test series being drawn, and England narrowly winning the ODI series 2–1.\nBy levelling the Test series with victory in the final Test, South Africa retained the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy they had earnt in England in 2008. Despite the decision made in 2008 to grant Test series between South Africa and England \"icon\" status, and thus comprise five Test matches and only three ODI matches, the tour retained the previous balance of four Tests and five ODIs.\nA quiet, friendly series erupted with controversy in the third and fourth Tests of the series. On the third day of the third Test, television images showed Stuart Broad standing on the ball, and fellow England pace-bowler James Anderson picking at the leather of the ball, causing South Africa to raise concerns about the condition of the ball, and the actions of the England duo. After some delay, the South African team announced that they were not making an official complaint to the International Cricket Council (ICC), who in turn confirmed that the matter was closed. In the fourth Test, after an apparent nick by Graeme Smith was taken by wicket-keeper Matt Prior, the umpire Tony Hill turned down the appeal, and third umpire Daryl Harper upheld Hill's decision on review. However, TV replays showed an audible noise as the ball passed the bat. England announced that they would lodge an official complaint with the ICC, with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) asking for the review to be reinstated. The ICC defended Harper, but said that it would launch a \"full and comprehensive investigation\" into the incident after the match."

Prior to the draft, Romano graduated from St. Anthony's High School on Long Island, and played for the New York Bobcats of the Atlantic Junior Hockey League, scoring 50 goals in the 2005–06 season. After being drafted, he spent the following year playing for Cornell University, where he led the team's rookies with a total of nine goals and ten assists.\nRomano then went on to play for the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League during the 2007–08 season, citing the switch in leagues due to his limited number of games played in Cornell. Romano didn't play well during this season, partially due to off-season shoulder surgery. Romano played for the Peterborough Petes in the following season, where he scored 36 goals in 65 games. He was the team's leading scorer for the season.\nOn June 30, 2009, Romano was traded from the New Jersey Devils to the New York Islanders in exchange for Ben Walter and a conditional 2012 draft pick. After being traded, Romano attended the Islanders' \"mini-camp,\" where many of the younger Islanders players began training together. Regarding joining the Islanders, Romano said, \"I’ve put in a lot of time through the years. I’ve worked hard all my life, and to possibly be one phone call away from playing with them is a great feeling. I’m a hometown kid and this is the team I grew up idolizing. Pierre Turgeon was my favorite player, and I remember going to the game when they retired Bryan Trottier’s number. It’s just real comforting to be here and be close to home.\"\nAfter beginning the 2009–10 season with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League, he was assigned to the Utah Grizzlies of the ECHL on December 8, 2009.\nAfter three seasons with Sound Tigers, Romano signed a one-year deal with Austrian EBEL side Vienna Capitals. After one season in the EBEL, Romano played two years in the Swedish second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan with Västerås and Malmö Redhawks. After one year playing in Norway, Romano signed a one-year contract with the Odense Bulldogs of the Danish Metal Ligaen in July 2016."

Nigeria also qualified to the 2012 Summer Olympics, where their team consisted of 10 Nigerian-Americans, 10 of which were born in the United States.\nOther competitions.\nNigeria has won several medals at the All-Africa Games, and placed 4th in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, falling short to 3rd place England.\nThe Nigerian male basketball team D'tigers participated in the 2018 Gold coast common wealth games and lost all games they played.\nAfrobasket 2015 Champions.\nNigeria's senior men's basketball teams, a.k.a. D’Tigers, are finally the champions of Africa following their exploits at the recently held 2015 Afrobasket Men's Championship in Tunisia from August 19–30, 2015.\nThe victory we are celebrating today did not come easy as the Tijjani Umar-led Board of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) had to face different hurdles on the way to get to this level which other Boards before it strove to attain.\nThe road to today's success actually began in 2013 following the second tenure of Tijjani Umar as president of the NBBF. Despite distractions placed on its way, the Board began work in earnest and went for the best players the country had within and outside the shores of the country.\nAt the Afrobasket in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 2013, many basketball faithful looked up to Nigeria to break the stranglehold Angola had on the continent's basketball but injuries and other technical factors scuttled that dream.\nNot one to take defeat lightly, Umar and his team with contributions from the players, did a self appraisal and came to the conclusion that, the team, with its array of world class players, needed the services of an experienced technical hand to transform the team into the champions they truly are.\nThat was how, American William Voigt was selected from among the names who applied to tinker the Nigerian team. He too, hungry to succeed on his first assignment in Africa, came along with his own staff to complement the Nigerian assistants provided by the NBBF.\nThree players from the Nigerian league, the DStv Men's Basketball League, were among the preliminary team selected to begin camping in Abuja on July 15, 2015, but visa hitches prevented them from joining the team's pre-tournament training in France and Italy where the team participated in invitational tournaments as well as friendly matches.\nPainfully though, just when the team was rounding off their training in Italy, the team's pivot, Ike Diogu picked up a calf-muscle injury which eventually ruled him out of the competition.\nWhile some basketball pundits saw this as a setback and actually concluded that Nigeria's dream of becoming African Champions had been shattered, Diogu himself, feeling bad though, told his teammates that he was just one person out of the 12 soldiers going to war, pressing it on them that they were capable of beating every contender to the title.\nThe turning point for the team was the loss to host country, Tunisia, in the group stage. NBBF president, Umar told the players in the locker room that the loss was a wake-up call for them to gird their loins and play the best basketball of their lives.\nFrom there they never looked back as they took every game in their stride until they met their 2013 nemesis, Senegal who they dispatched in over-time after a grueling game that put the capacity crowd on the edge of their seats.\nNow in the final, the players were more fired up to end the reign of the Angolans, who had earlier, on the road to the final, lost to Senegal in the group stage.\nGoing into the final, the Director-General of the National Sports Commission (NSC), Mallam Al-Hassan Yakmut had confirmed to the NBBF President, that the Vice President, on behalf of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was going to put a call through to the team to wish it good luck on behalf of an expectant nation.\nMinutes before the jump-ball in the final, the team received a call from the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who told the players to believe that they could stop Angola's winning streak and become African champions.\nWith that message at the back of their mind, like the tigers they truly are, they went into the game, the initial bravado by the Angolans notwithstanding, clawed their way back, point after point, making the perennial champions look ordinary in the process until they were finally dethroned by a nine-point victory for Nigeria at 74–65. Their first in the history of the championship and an Olympic ticket in the kitty.\nThey have done the great work, beating the dreaded Angolans and clinching a back to back Olympic ticket. The rest is for the people and government of Nigeria to appreciate and reward this historic feat.\nSponsorship Deal.\nThe Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF), recently unveiled Econnetmedia, owner of Kwese Sports as the new title sponsor of the Men's Premier Basketball League.\nWith the formal signing of the agreement and unveiling of the title sponsor, the Men Premier Basketball League which was formerly known as DStv Premier Basketball League, will now be called and known as ‘Kwese Premier Basketball League,\nFormer NBBF President, Tijjani Umar disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja to unveil the name of the new title sponsor for the league.\nUmar said the sponsorship deal is worth $12 million for five years (2017-2021) at a license fee of $2.2 million per season for all NBBF events including the Men's Premier Basketball League.\nThe $2.2 million per season deal is bigger than the previous four-year deal with DStv which was worth only $1.5 million for the four years duration.\nThe former president added that the exclusively broadcasting right of Kwese Premier Basketball League, including the 2017 league season which dunked off in Lagos is now owned by the Kwese Sports Channel.\nIn April 2018, the Ahmadu Musa Kida led NBBF to sign a 60 million Naira sponsorship deal for the Nigerian Divisions 1 and 2 male basketball leagues with Total Nigeria limited.\nAfrobasket Women 2017.\nNAMES OF PLAYERS AND COACHES INVITED TO NATIONAL CAMP IN PREPARATION FOR THE AFROBASKET 2017 WOMEN CHAMPIONSHIP IN BAMAKO, MALI.\nThe Camps will resume on Monday, 24 July 2017 in Orlando, Florida, USA and Lagos, Nigeria respectively.

        "text": "The men's triple jump at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on 16 and 18 August. The season had seen a number of athletes performing to a high level before the championships, with reigning World and Olympic champion Nelson Évora leading with 17.66 metres and all three athletes of the Cuban team having jumped over 17.60 m in the season. The other athlete to jump that distance was Phillips Idowu, who was keen make up for his loss to Évora in the 2008 Olympics. The Olympic medallists Évora, Idowu, and Leevan Sands, and the Cuban trio of David Giralt, Yoandris Betanzos and Alexis Copello, were judged to be the strongest competitors entering the competition.\nIn the qualifying rounds, Évora and Idowu were the first to pass the automatic qualifying mark of 17.15 metres, recording bests of 17.44 and 17.32 m respectively. Chinese jumper Li Yanxi was the third through the qualifying mark, and Sands and Giralt soon followed. The qualifying was not of the same standard as the 2008 Olympic final, as Copello and Dmitrij Valukevic rounded out the top twelve competitors with jumps under 17 m.\nIn the final, Olympic champion Évora set the standard with a first jump of 17.54 m, Idowu also started well with a jump of 17.51 m. Giralt and Sands moved into third and fourth with jumps around the 17.2 m mark. Évora led the competition until round three, where Idowu produced a personal best and world-leading jump of 17.73 m to take the top spot. A large jump by Alexis Copello followed, but he was given the red flag, indicating a foul. Sands' season's best jump of 17.32 m moved him into the third medal spot, but it was Copello's final jump of 17.36 m that took the bronze medal. Évora's best also came in the final round, but the 17.55-metre jump did not rival that of Idowu. It was the thirty-one-year-old Briton's first ever major title, building on his silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 17.15 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nKey: NR = National record, PB = Personal best, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)"

        "title": "1972 Daytona 500",
        "text": "The 1972 Daytona 500, the 14th running of the event, was held on February 20, 1972, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. A. J. Foyt, driving a 1971 Mercury, won the race.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for David Sisco and Walter Ballard. Only Daytona 500 start for Richard D. Brown, George Altheide, David Ray Boggs, Ed Hessert, Larry Dickson, Jimmy Finger, Mark Donohue, and Raymond Williams. Last Daytona 500 starts for Vic Elford, Henley Grey, Ben Arnold, Bill Seifert, Elmo Langley, and Bill Champion.\nSummary.\nFoyt drove his number 21 to victory after starting the race from the outside front-row position. There were three cautions flags which slowed the race for a total of 17 laps. Foyt dominated the event, winning by almost two laps over his closest competitor. The victory over Charlie Glotzbach was Foyt's first win of the season.\nThe 1972 Daytona 500 has the distinction of being the event which had the fewest leaders for a NASCAR race held at Daytona International Speedway; with only Foyt, Richard Petty, and Bobby Allison recorded as leading a lap during the competition. The Daytona 500 was the second event held during the 1972 season, and completed in three hours and five minutes with an average speed of 161 mph. There were a total of 13 lead changes between Foyt, Allison, and Petty throughout the race.\nFoyt's victory would earn him a spot on the cover of Sports Illustrated, the first time for a reigning Daytona 500 champion.\nWalter Ballard had a huge crash in this race on lap 16 as a result of getting together with Buddy Baker in the tri-oval. Baker himself would disappear from the race on lap 18. Ballard went upside down after climbing the nose of Baker's car. He rolled into the tri-oval grass and barrel rolled 3 times before coming back onto all fours. Both drivers were uninjured.\nRaymond Williams earned the dubious honor of being the only driver ever to both begin and finish in last-place in the same Daytona 500. Also, attrition was through the roof in this race, as only 26 cars even made it 200 miles, just 22 cars ran at least half the race, and just 19 made it 110 laps. Also, the distances between some of the leading finishers were just astounding. Third-place finisher Jim Vandiver (and fourth-place Benny Parsons) was six laps/15 miles behind the winner, fifth-place James Hylton was 9 laps/22.5 miles behind, sixth-place Cale Yarborough was 12 laps/30 miles or 6% of the race distance behind, and 10th-place finisher Vic Elford was 18 laps/45 miles or 9% of the race distance behind Foyt.\nBobby Isaac won the pole but A.J. Foyt overtook him right at the start although the two fought for the lead on the first lap. As Foyt pulled away Issac's day turned out to be a short one as engine problems put the K&amp;K Insurance Dodge on the trailer before the 10 percent mark of the race.\nStatistics.\nReference:"

The other cyclists spent energy, getting him back, while Willems could cycle along and save his energy. Five loops before the finish, every looped cyclist had to exit the race, and only 15 cyclists remained, including Maas and Willems. In the last loop, the sprint started, with Wyld, Alden and De Martino. Willems went around them, and 100 m from the finish, all four men were next to each other.

        "text": "The 1914 Giro d'Italia was the sixth \"Giro\"; it was organised and sponsored by the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race began on 24 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Cuneo, finishing back in Milan on 6 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Alfonso Calzolari of the Stucchi team. Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Pierino Albini and Luigi Lucotti.\nIt was the last Giro before the Great War and the first one with a final classification based on time rather than points.\nIt is remembered as the hardest Giro of the heroic period of bicycle racing. Besides five stages of over 400 km (and the longest ever average stage length), it included the longest stage ever in the history of the Giro: the Lucca-Rome stage won by Costante Girardengo. This edition of the Giro was run at the lowest average speed (23.374 km/h); marked the highest gap between the first and the second (1 hour, 55 minutes and 26 seconds); saw the longest ever stage by time taken (the Bari-L'Aquila). Only 8 riders (of 81 participants) finished the race.\nThe sixth stage (Bari-L'Aquila) is remembered as the hardest stage in the history of the Giro, with many riders forced to retire, including the first of the general classification Giuseppe Azzini, who was found the next day resting in a country house.\nThe Giro organisation declared Calzolari winner after the race, but a legal battle started between the Giro organisation and the Italian Cycling Union, who thought Calzolari should have been removed from the race for taking help from a car, making Albini the winner. After 14 months in court, the final decision was in favor of the Giro organisation, thus making Calzolari the definitive winner.\nParticipants.\nBefore the race started, 98 cyclists had entered themselves in the race, of which 35 were professional cyclists in a team, 41 were professional cyclists without a team, and 22 were amateurs (). Favorites for the race were Lucien Petit-Breton from France, and Ganna, Galetti, Girardengo, Giuseppe Santhià and Azzini from Italy. Race director Cougnet decided to allow amateurs due to the low number of cyclists and teams that had registered in the weeks prior to the start. Many of these riders were unemployed and borrowed bikes in order to participate. Umberto Ripamonti was the youngest to enter the race at age nineteen.\nAt 24 May, when the Giro began, 81 of them started the race; only eight of them made it to the finish in Milan on 7 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were eight teams that competed in the race: Alcyon, Atala, Bianchi, Ganna, Gerbi, Globo, Maino, and Stucchi. The field featured three former Giro d'Italia champions in the 1909 winner Luigi Ganna, three-time winner Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi who was a member of the 1912 Atala winning team, and returning champion Carlo Oriani. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Costante Girardengo, Angelo Gremo, Alfonso Calzolari, and Giovanni Gerbi.\nRace summary.\nThe race itself began at midnight. Angelo Gremo won the stage ahead of Carlo Durando and Alfonso Calzolari who finished over thirteen minutes in arrears. After those three finishers, 34 more crossed the line with the last rider finishing 7 hours after Calzolari. Only three aspiranti riders remained.\nFinal standings.\nThe race compared to the previous year's edition featured fewer stages and a longer total distance. The route covered the whole stretch of the country from northwest to southeast in Bari. Race director Armando Cougnet decided to abandon the points system for calculating the general classification in favor of a purely time based approached where the leader was the rider with the lowest total time raced for all stages – a decision the Tour de France director Henri Desgrange did in 1913. The prize for winning the race in 1914 was 3,000 lire.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were eight cyclists who had completed all eight stages. For these cyclists, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner. Enrico Sala won the prize for best ranked isolati rider in the general classification.\nOf the two cyclists without a team, Sala rode as a professional and Ripamonti as an amateur .\nAftermath.\nDuring the race, Calzolari, Canepari and Durando had been given a penalty of 3 hours, for taking help from a car. After the race, the Italian Cycling Union said that the Giro jury had made a wrong decision, and that the three cyclists should have been removed from the race, declaring Albini the winner. The Giro organisation did not agree, and declared that Calzolari stayed the winner. The two parties went to court, and in February the Giro organisation won, and again after an appeal in July 1915, making Calzolari the definitive winner.\nThe race has since been regarded as the hardest Grand Tour of all-time. The route featured the longest average stage length at , the longest individual stage which was stage five covering from Lucca to Rome, the smallest number of finishers at 8 riders, the highest percentage of retirements at 90%, and the longest individual stage time at 19h 34’ 47” which was the sixth stage from Bari-L’Aquila. Due to the race's reputation, British author Tim Moore rode the route in autumn of 2012. Moore elected to ride the course in period attire and on a period bicycle. He then published a book where he detailed his exploits entitled \"Gironimo!: Riding the Very Terrible 1914 Tour of Italy\"."

Roberts donated more land to the people of Galashiels and on 14 July 1914, Galashiels Golf Club commenced with the development of an 18-hole layout that was designed by James Braid.\nBraid won his first British Open in 1901 and subsequently won again four times, and was runner up on three occasions – all of this in the space of 10 years. Other notable clubs such as Gleneagles, Carnoustie, Royal Musselburgh, Dalmahoy and Royal Burgess were among the 200 courses designed by him. He was also a founder member and President of the PGA, and was instrumental in laying the foundation of the professional game as we know it today.\nThe Galashiels Tournament, a professional event sponsored to the tune of £300 by the merchants of Galashiels, was staged on 19–20 May 1920, attracting an impressive field. With the advantage of local knowledge, James Braid took the honours with Harry Vardon the runner up."

As the only independent country on the continent during the Scramble for Africa, rugby did not have much of a presence locally due to lack of exposure to the game by rugby-playing European nations.\nIn 2006, a New Zealand expatriate in Ethiopia established Nyala RFC, the country's first official rugby squad. A co-ed team based in Addis Ababa, it consisted of rugby enthusiasts of various nationalities, sizes and ages. Taxi drivers who once transported the first squad members to the games came to represent a large proportion of the club's players. Rugby was also being taught to itinerant youth at the same capital's lone facility.\nBy 2007, the Ethiopian squad's coaching staff was inviting more established foreign squads from Dubai and Kenya to face off against in exhibition games. An international rugby exhibition tournament was later held in Addis Ababa in June 2009. The team eventually hopes to participate in the rugby Sevens World Cup.\nGeneral coverage of rugby via a South African satellite network has led to additional local interest in the sport. Ethiopian rugby was also made the subject of a documentary short, called \"Playing Rough\".\nManagement.\nThe Ethiopian rugby squad is coached by Frenchman Fabrice Houpeaux. He is assisted by another French national and a New Zealander.\nEquipment and facilities.\nAs of 2007, Ethiopia's rugby squad has no dedicated pitch with posts on which to play. Training sessions are held on the Jan Meda public field in Addis Ababa.\nThe team is equipped with rugby balls and kits, gear provided by 2007 Rugby World Cup host France through the \"Rendez-Vous 2007\" initiative. France also sent two Ethiopian players to the RWC to study the game. In 2009, new jerseys were imported from Britain.\nIn the wake of the global tournament, the Ethiopian rugby team's coaching staff hopes that more such involvement by countries with prominent rugby traditions will help develop the sport in Ethiopia.\nFunding.\nAddis Nyala Rugby Club is financed through membership fees. Money from an exhibition tournament has also gone toward rehabilitating the Jan Meda pitch. Additionally, the funds have paid for health insurance coverage for the squad's Ethiopian players.\nGoverning body.\nThere is no governing body to regulate and oversee rugby in Ethiopia. As the sport is in its infancy, establishing a national rugby federation is among the future objectives of the Ethiopian squad's coaching staff."

He represented for New South Wales and Australia, captaining the national side on eleven occasions from 1972 to 1973.\nEarly life and rugby.\nSullivan was schooled at Chatswood Boys High School and played his early rugby at the Forest Rugby Club in Forestville. His senior rugby started in Wollongong and in his first season of first grade and scarcely eighteen he was selected for the Illawarra region and from there he was selected for New South Wales after just six senior games. Howell writes that following state selection at such a young age, he found himself a marked man at club level and \"injuries followed, his form deteriorated and his confidence with it\" He did not represent again until 1970. In the mid 1970s he coached and was Physical Education teacher at Glenwood Boys High School in Durban South Africa.\nRepresentative career.\nIn 1969 Sullivan relocated to Sydney and joined the Gordon Rugby Club. He spent some time in reserve grade in that first season in Sydney first grade but in 1970 he regained his state position in a match against Scotland and he represented for Sydney against those same visitors.\nIn 1971 Sullivan appeared for New South Wales against the visiting British Lions and later that year when South Africa also toured, Sullivan was selected to meet them for Sydney, New South Wales and in three Test matches for Australia. He made the 1971 Australia rugby union tour of France and played in both Test matches, experiencing his first Wallaby victory in the first Test.\nIn 1972 he played in both home Test matches against the visiting French and he toured under captain Greg Davis on the 1972 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand and Fiji. He was injured and had to be replaced in the games against North Otago and in the first Test match. Howell writes that the seven loss &amp; five win result of the tour was \"a disaster and occasioned Davis' retirement\". An injury picked up in New Zealand prevented Davis from leading the side in the Test match in Fiji on the way home and Sullivan debuted as an Australian Test captain in the Wallabies' narrow 21–19 victory against Fiji. He had already captained the side in two mid-week games during the New Zealand leg.\nIn 1973 Peter Sullivan retained the Test captaincy in the two Test series against Tonga and was at the helm in the 2nd Test boil-over when Tonga got up 16–11. Howell writes of this period as \"the lowest ever point of Australian rugby\". He led the Wallabies on the 1973 Australia rugby union tour of Europe, and played in six of the nine matches including the Test loss against Wales. He was injured and did not take the field in the test against England, where the Wallabies were captained by John Hipwell.\nAll told Sullivan captained the Wallabies in four Tests through 1972–1973 and in nine tour matches. He played twenty-eight matches for Australia, thirteen of them Tests. Howell writes that he was \"a vigorous, aggressive player who played to the maximum when wearing the green and gold\".\nRugby league career.\nKeen to secure his family's financial future Sullivan signed a five-year contract with the St George Dragons at the end of the 1973 season. He managed only one first grade game before a serious knee injury ended his playing days.\nCareer summary.\nTest matches.\nPlaying for Australia"

Veteran athlete Virgilijus Alekna, the last athlete to beat Kanter in competition, was a strong medal possibility. Olympic silver medallist Piotr Małachowski was another contender, as was German Robert Harting who won silver at the previous world championships. The season had been of a high standard, with a number of athletes throwing over 65 m, including Frank Casañas, Bogdan Pishchalnikov and Zoltán Kővágó.\nOn the first day of competition, qualification went smoothly as many of the highest ranked athletes qualified for the final on their first throw, with seven of them passing the automatic qualification mark of 64.50 m. Casañas and Estonia's number two Aleksander Tammert were the only high-profile athletes to be eliminated. Home competitor Harting had the best throw of the day (66.81), and Kővágó and Kanter were the next best qualifiers.\nIn the final, Małachowski and Harting started very well on their first throws, with the former taking the lead with a Polish record-breaking throw, while the latter recorded a season's best. The pre-event favourites Kanter and Alekna were unable to challenge the two, as the Estonian took the bronze with his fourth round throw of 66.88 m and the Lithuanian never bettered his first throw of the day (66.36 m) and finished up in fourth place. Consistently throwing better than the rest of the field, Harting and Małachowski battled for the top spot. The Pole improved his lead with 69.15 m in the fifth round, another national record, but Harting took the gold with his final throw of the competition, recording a personal best of 69.43 m.\nThe victory for the home athlete was marred by his controversial comments regarding an initiative by victims of doping in East Germany. Former East German athletes, who had suffered through the state-sponsored doping program in the 1980s, were distributing glasses outside the stadium to encourage people not to \"turn a blind eye\" to doping. Harting said that he wished his discus would bounce from the ground and hit wearers in the eyes, but he later retracted and apologise for his statement.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 64.50 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nFinal.\nKey: PB = Personal best, NR = National record"

When Pelz's \"Preceptor Golf\" went bankrupt in 1988, Adams bought the assets and started Adams Golf. He moved the company to Dallas in 1991.\nAdams Golf initially specialized in custom fitted golf clubs, initially becoming associated with Hank Haney setting up a club fitting and repair shop at the Hank Haney Golf Ranch.\nAdams \"Tight Lies\" fairway wood became a commercial success as the result of television infomercial, with sportscaster Jack Whittaker as the host and narrator; Haney, then Tiger Woods' coach; Bill Rogers, British Open winner and PGA Player of the Year in 1981; and LPGA Hall of Famer Carol Mann, as spokespersons.\nIn 1998, Adams Golf went public on Wall Street, with an initial public offering underwritten by Lehman Brothers. Barney Adams was selected as Manufacturing Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst &amp; Young in 1999. Although semi-retired since 2000, Barney Adams retains the title Chairman of the Board until 2012.\nIn 2012, Adams Golf was acquired by TaylorMade Golf (which was owned by Adidas by then) for USD 10.80 per share in cash (roughly 70 million). As a result, Adams was added to the corporation set of golf brands, such as Adidas Golf and TaylorMade–adidas Golf. TaylorMade assured that Adams' headquarters in Plano, Texas, would remain. Nevertheless, by 2016 the Adams brand had lost market position, with some media considering it \"an afterthought\" at TaylorMade.\nIn 2020, after a 5-year hiatus from releasing new models, Adams released their Tight Lies series, a one-off line of fairway woods and hybrids. \nIn 2023, Adams Golf released a fully redesigned golf line.

The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in December 1803 and a report in the Sydney Gazette on 8 January 1804 suggested that cricket was already well established in the infant colony. By 1826, clubs including the Currency Cricket Club, the Military Cricket Club and the Australian Cricket Club had been formed. Hyde Park and the Racecourse were the venue for these organised matches. The formation of clubs in Van Diemen's Land (later Tasmania) was not far behind with clubs formed in Hobart in 1832 and Launceston (1841). In Western Australia a match was arranged in 1835 between the \"builders\" (probably architects and engineers) of the new Government House and a team of labourers and \"mechanics\" (an archaic term for trades people). In Victoria in 1838, the Melbourne Cricket Club was formed – it would become arguably Australia's most exclusive and influential cricket club. In 1839, a club was formed in South Australia.\nIntercolonial cricket in Australia started with a visit by cricketers from Victoria to Tasmania in February 1851. The match was played in Launceston on 11–12 February with Tasmania winning by 3 wickets. Another three matches between the two teams were played before 1854 but in time the crossing of Bass Strait became less attractive to the Victorians and the focus turned to the neighbouring colony of New South Wales. These matches attracted large crowds, including a crowd of 15,000 at a match in Sydney in January 1853. Boards of control were formed in the various colonies: New South Wales in 1857, Victoria in 1864 and South Australia in 1871.\nEarly tours.\nThe first tour by an English team to Australia was in 1861–62, organised by the catering firm of Spiers and Pond as a private enterprise. Captained by HH Stephenson, the team largely consisted of cricketers from Surrey and while not wholly representative was reasonably strong. While the locals efforts, even when receiving odds, were mostly in vain, the tour was popular with spectators and highly profitable for the cricketers and promoters alike. A further tour followed in 1863–64, led by George Parr and was even more successful than the last.\nFirst Australian team to tour England.\nIn 1866–67, Tom Wills, a troubled but brilliant sportsman who had captained the Victorian cricket team in 1856, led an all-Aboriginal cricket team on an Australian tour as its captain-coach.\nAnother tour was launched in 1868, thus Aboriginal cricketers constituted the first Australian teams to tour England. The 1868 team was captained by Charles Lawrence, a member of Stephenson's team in 1861 who remained in Australia, and mainly recruited from the Harrow and Edenhope areas of the Wimmera region in western Victoria. Including outstanding cricketers such as Johnny Mullagh, the team played 47 matches, winning 14, drawing 19 and losing 14. In addition to cricket, the players demonstrated athletic prowess before, after and during games, including throwing boomerangs and spears. The heavy workload and inclement weather took its toll with King Cole contracting a fatal case of tuberculosis during the tour.\nFurther tours by English teams took place in 1873-74 (featuring the most notable cricketer of the age W.G. Grace) and 1876–77. The 1876-77 season was notable for a match between a combined XI from New South Wales and Victoria and the touring Englishmen at the Melbourne Cricket Ground played on 15–19 March. This match, later to be recognised as the first Test Match, was won by Australia by 45 runs, thanks mainly to an unbeaten 165 by Charles Bannerman. The result of this match was seen by Australians and Englishmen as a reflection of the rising standard of Australian cricket.\nOrigin of the Ashes and Sheffield Shield.\nThe rising standards of Australian cricket was further established during the first representative tour of England in 1878. While the Australians did not play a representative English team on this tour, the efforts of players such as Billy Murdoch, Fred Spofforth and Jack Blackham attracted much public interest. A return visit in 1878-79 is best remembered for a riot and by the time Australia visited England in 1880, playing the first Test in England at The Oval, a system of international tours was well established. A famous victory on the 1882 tour of England resulted in the placement of a satirical obituary in an English newspaper, \"The Sporting Times.\" The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the \"body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\". The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882–83) as the quest to regain The Ashes.\nThe Sheffield Shield, the premier first-class cricket competition in Australia, was established in 1892 by the Australasian Cricket Council, the first attempt at a national cricket board. The Shield was purchased from funds donated by Lord Sheffield, the financier of the English tour of 1891–92. The council was formed with representation from New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and with the aim of regulating intercolonial cricket and organising international tours. This last aim met resistance from the leading players of the day such as George Giffen. The players had previously run tours as a private enterprise, splitting profits amongst themselves and were unwilling to relinquish control of appointing a captain and team selection. Conflict between players and administrators would become a running theme in Australian cricket.\nGolden Age and the Great War.\nThe era from the mid-1890s to the World War I has been described as Australian cricket's golden age. This era saw the emergence of players such as Monty Noble, Clem Hill and in particular Victor Trumper, who was idolised by the Australian public. It also saw the continuing battle between the Melbourne Cricket Club and the players on one side with the state boards and the new Australian Board of Control on the other. The dispute was over the organisation of international tours and the revenue streams it created. It culminated in 1912 with the withdrawal of six leading players; Trumper, Hill, Warwick Armstrong, Vernon Ransford, Albert Cotter and Hanson \"Sammy\" Carter from the tri-nations series in England that year and a fistfight between Hill and his fellow selector Peter McAlister. The tour was unsuccessful and dogged by controversy.\nThe Great War lead to the suspension of both international and Sheffield Shield cricket and the enlistment of many cricketers in the AIF. After the war, a team consisting of cricketers enlisted in the AIF toured the United Kingdom. The Australian Imperial Forces cricket team was strong, including cricketers such as Herbie Collins, Bert Oldfield and the all-rounder, Jack Gregory, all of whom would play a large part in the fortunes of the national team in the future.\nBetween the wars: Bradman and Bodyline.\nInternational cricket recommenced with a tour by a weakened England team in 1920–21. The strong Australian team, led by Armstrong and with a bowling attack spearheaded by Gregory and Ted McDonald won the series 5–0, the first time this was achieved in an Ashes series. The 1920s was an era of batting dominance. The Victorian opening batsman, Bill Ponsford was the chief destroyer of bowling attacks, scoring 429 against Tasmania in 1922-23 and topping that in 1927-28 with an innings against Queensland of 437. In between these innings, in 1926–27, his Victorian team made 1,107, the highest first class innings total to date. Ponsford's contribution was a mere 352.\nHowever, the greatest run machine in the history of Australian cricket was yet to come. Don Bradman, born in Cootamundra and raised in Bowral was 20 when he made his Test debut in the first Test of the 1928-29 series against England. He made 18 and 1 and was promptly dropped for the next Test. Recalled for the third Test in Melbourne, he scored 112 in the second innings to establish his place in the team for the next twenty years. During his illustrious career, he would hold the records for the highest individual Test innings and the most centuries in Test cricket and when he retired in 1948 he had the highest Test batting average, the last a record he still holds. He scored 117 first class centuries, still the only Australian to score a century of centuries and was knighted for services to cricket.\nAll that was still to come for Bradman when he toured England with the Australian team in 1930. Bradman scored heavily, 974 runs at an average of 139.14 including a then world record 334 at Leeds, two other double centuries and another single. Watching these displays of batting was Douglas Jardine, playing for Surrey. Following discussions with other observers such as Percy Fender and George Duckworth, he developed a tactic to limit the prodigious run scoring of Bradman and the others. The tactic, originally called fast leg theory and later called bodyline involved fast short pitched bowling directed at the batsman's body and a packed leg side field. Appointed captain of England for the 1932-33 series in Australia, Jardine was able to put these theories into practice.\nCombined with bowlers of the speed and accuracy of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, the tactic required batsmen to risk injury in order to protect their wicket. In the third Test in Adelaide, Larwood struck Australian captain Bill Woodfull above the heart and fractured wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull. The crowd was incensed and public feeling in Australia was high. A minor diplomatic incident ensued and for a time it appeared that cricketing relations between the two nations would be cut and the tour called off. Eventually diplomacy prevailed and the tour continued, England winning the series 4–1. The effect of bodyline can be seen by looking at Bradman's batting average, a respectable 56.57, the highest for Australia that series, but much lower than his Shield average of 150 over the same period.\nIn December 1934, the Australian women's team played the English women in the first women's Test match at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. Despite a 7 wicket haul to Anne Palmer in the first innings, the English women were too strong and won by 9 wickets.\nPost War consolidation.\nOnce again, war brought a stop to Shield and Test cricket as Australia mobilised for World War II. Immediately after the end of the war in Europe in 1945, an Australian Services XI played a series of Victory Tests in England. The team was captained by Lindsay Hassett and it saw the emergence of the charismatic all-rounder Keith Miller. The series was drawn 2-2. After the retirement of Bradman in 1948, Hassett, Miller and all-rounder Ray Lindwall formed the nucleus of the Australian team. They were later joined by leg spinning all-rounder, Richie Benaud and batsman Neil Harvey.\nIn 1951 Menzies enthusiasm for cricket, lead him to inaugurate the annual Prime Minister's XI cricket match in 1951 at Manuka Oval in Canberra. Robert Menzies favourite pastime or 'obsession' as some say was to watch and follow cricket. The first game was against the visiting international team the West Indies. Menzies was a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Club and knew many cricketers including Donald Bradman whom he declared was the 'undisputed master batsman of his time'. Menzies found cricket a useful diplomatic tool that Commonwealth nations had in common, as he stated that Great Britain and Australia were of the same blood, allegiance, history and instinctive mental processes.\nBy the 1958-59 series, Benaud was captain of the Australian side and managed to recover the Ashes. The 1960-61 series at home against the West Indies was widely regarded as one of the most memorable. A commitment by Benaud and his West Indian offsider Frank Worrell to entertaining cricket revived lagging interest in the sport. The gripping series, including the first tied Test, saw Australia win 2-1 and become the inaugural holders of the newly commissioned Frank Worrell Trophy. The West Indian team was held in such affection that a ticker-tape parade in their honour prior to their departure from Australia attracted a crowd of 300,000 Melburnians to wish them farewell.\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was an ongoing controversy regarding illegal bowling actions. A number of bowlers, Australian and international were accused of throwing or \"chucking\" over this period including the South Australian pair of Alan Hitchcox and Peter Trethewey and New South Welshman, Gordon Rorke. The controversy reached a high point when Ian Meckiff was recalled to the Australian team for the first Test of the 1963-64 series against South Africa. Called on to bowl his first over, he was no-balled 4 times by umpire Colin Egar for throwing before being removed from the attack by his skipper, Benaud. As a consequence, Meckiff retired from all levels of cricket after the match and Egar received death threats from persons aggrieved at his call.\nRebel tours and revolution.\nThe 1970s saw players and administrators once again come into conflict. Poor scheduling saw Australia visit South Africa immediately after a tour to India in 1969–70. This would be the last tour to South Africa prior to the application of international sporting sanctions designed to oppose the policy of apartheid. The tired Australians came across a very strong South African team in conditions vastly different from the subcontinent, and were subsequently beaten 4–0. A request by the Australian Cricket Board for the players to play a further match in South Africa was met with resistance by the players, led by the captain, Bill Lawry.\nDuring the following home series against England, Lawry was sacked as captain and replaced by the South Australian batsman, Ian Chappell. Lawry remains the only Australian captain to be sacked in the middle of a Test series. Chappell, part of a younger and more assertive generation, saw the board's treatment of Lawry's as disgraceful and made a pledge to never allow himself to be placed in the same situation.\nGreg Chappell, Ian's younger brother, succeeded him as captain in 1975-76 and lead the Australian team in the Centenary Test in Melbourne in March 1977. A celebration of 100 years of Test cricket, Australia won the Test by 45 runs, the precise result of the corresponding game 100 years earlier.\nWhile Australian cricket celebrated, the Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer was making plans to wrest away the television rights for Australian cricket. During the 1977 Ashes tour, the cricket world became aware that Packer had signed 35 of the world's top cricketers for a series of matches, including 18 Australians, 13 of whom were part of the tour party. World Series Cricket, as the breakaway group was known split Australian cricket in two for nearly three years. Former Australian captain, Bob Simpson was recalled from retirement to lead an inexperienced team in a home series against India in 1977–78, won 3-2 and then a tour to the West Indies, marred by an ugly riot. For the 1978-79 Ashes series, he was replaced by the young Victorian, Graham Yallop. The subsequent thrashing, a 5-1 victory for England, and the success of World Series Cricket forced the Australian Cricket Board to concede on Packer's terms.\nThe settlement between the ACB and WSC lead to the introduction of a series of innovations including night cricket, coloured clothing and an annual limited overs tri-series called the World Series Cup. It also signalled the return of the champion cricketers Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh. Their retirement at the end of the 1983-84 season was quickly followed by a series of tours to South Africa by a rebel Australian team in breach of the sporting sanctions imposed on the apartheid regime. The combined effect was to leave Australian cricket at its nadir under reluctant captain, Allan Border, losing Test series at home (2-1) and away (1-0) to New Zealand in 1985–86.\nModern dominance.\nThe long road back for Australian cricket started in India in 1986–87. Border, along with Bob Simpson in a new role as coach, set out to identify a group of players that a team could form around. These players showed some of the steel necessary in the famous tied Test at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Returning to the subcontinent for the World Cup in 1987, Australia surprised the cricket world by defeating England at Eden Gardens in Kolkata to win the tournament with a disciplined brand of cricket. By the 1989 Ashes tour, the development of players such as Steve Waugh and David Boon and the discovery of Mark Taylor and Ian Healy had reaped rewards. The 4-0 drubbing of England was the first time since 1934 that Australia had recovered the Ashes away from home and marked the resurgence of Australia as a cricketing power. Australia would hold the Ashes for the next 16 years.\nThe most successful leg spin bowler in the history of the game, Shane Warne, made his debut in 1991-92 in the third Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He had an undistinguished Test debut, taking 1/150 off 45 overs, and recording figures of 1/228 in his first Test series. From this modest beginning, Warne dominated Australian cricket for 15 years, taking 708 wickets at an average of 25.41. When the fast medium bowler, Glenn McGrath was first selected in the Australian team for the Perth test against New Zealand in 1993–94, the core of a highly successful bowling attack was formed. In 1994–95, under new captain Taylor, the Australians defeated the then dominant West Indies in the Caribbean to recover the Frank Worrell Trophy for the first time since 1978 and staked a claim to be considered the best team in the world.\nFollowing a disappointing World Cup at home in 1992, Australia then entered a run of extraordinarily successful World Cup campaigns; runners up to Sri Lanka in 1996 in the subcontinent, fighting back after early setbacks to win in England in 1999 and unbeaten on their way to another victory in South Africa. The change in captain from Taylor to Steve Waugh made little difference in the success of the Australian team. Waugh made a slightly rocky start to his term as captain, drawing 2-2 with the West Indies in the Caribbean and losing to Sri Lanka 1-0 away. A victory in the Australian team's first ever Test match against Zimbabwe was the start of an unparalleled 16 Test winning streak. The streak was finally ended in 2001 in Kolkata with a remarkable victory by India after being asked to follow-on. For Waugh, India would remain unconquered territory.\nAustralia's success was not without its detractors. Accusations of racism were made against the Australian team, one incident leading to a suspension for Darren Lehmann in 2003. Contacts between Warne and batsman Mark Waugh and illegal bookmakers, at first kept under cover by the ACB, were later revealed by the Australian press, sparking accusations of hypocrisy given Australian cricket's earlier attitude toward match fixing allegations. Warne would later be suspended from all forms of cricket for 12 months after testing positive to banned diuretics \"hydrochlorothiazide\" and \"amiloride\". The brand of cricket played by the Australian team was praised for its spirit and aggressiveness but critics charged that this aggressive approach lead to ugly sledging incidents such as the confrontation between McGrath and West Indian batsman, Ramnaresh Sarwan at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003. Tasmanian batsman Ricky Ponting would admit to an alcohol problem after incidents in India and in Sydney.\nA rehabilitated Ponting would succeed Waugh as captain in 2004. While injured for most of the 2004-05 series against India, his team under acting captain Adam Gilchrist defeated India in India, the first Australian series win in India since Bill Lawry's team in 1969–70. A 2-1 defeat in the 2005 Ashes series in England was quickly avenged at home with a 5-0 thrashing of England in 2006-07. The whitewash was the first in an Ashes series since Warwick Armstrong's team in 1920–21. Following the series, the successful bowling combination of McGrath and Warne retired from Test cricket, with a record that will be hard to match as the Australian team endeavours to retain its place at the top of world cricket.\nMost recently Australia won the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the Caribbean and were unbeaten through the tournament. Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden scored the most runs in the tournament. The finals happened to be Glenn McGrath's last match and he was also the highest wicket taker of the tournament and the player of the tournament.\nThe 2015 Cricket World Cup was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand from 14 February to 29 March 2015. Fourteen teams played 49 matches in 14 venues, with Australia staging 26 games at grounds in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. Australia defeated New Zealand by 7 wickets to win their fifth ICC Cricket World Cup in front of a record crowd of 93,013. The winning captain Michael Clarke, retired from ODIs with immediate effect after the final match.\nOn 12 January 2019, Australia won the first ODI against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 34 runs, to record their 1,000th win in international cricket.\nThe second ICC World Test Championship started on 4 August 2021 and finished with Australia lifting the trophy after defeating India in the final in June 2023.\nCricket World Cup Record.\nWhite: Group/Round-Robin Stage"

        "text": "The women's high jump event at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany was held between 18 August and 20 August 2009.\nReigning champion Blanka Vlašić had spent the 2007 and 2008 seasons largely unbeaten, but high-profile losses in the Olympic high jump final and the 2008 IAAF Golden League final spelled the end for her lengthy winning streak. The rise of Germany's Ariane Friedrich in the 2009 season had seen her take the European Indoor title and make the world-leading jump of 2.06 m. Having beaten Vlašić in three of their five meetings that season, she was one of Germany's best prospects for a gold medal on home turf. Outside of the two top high jumpers, Antonietta Di Martino and Ruth Beitia had also performed well that season and 2004 Olympic gold medallist Yelena Slesarenko was another strong contender.\nVlašić had an unexpected setback before the qualifiers, suffering a deep gash in her head after hitting a doorway, but after receiving stitches she arrived at the stadium in time for the competition. All the expected finalists made their way through the qualification rounds. All but three of the twelve finalists managed the 1.95 m automatic qualifying mark, with Meike Kröger being a surprise second finalist for the host nation through her best non-qualifying mark of 1.92 m. Although the event was largely portrayed as a head-to-head between Vlašić and Friedrich, Russian Anna Chicherova proved to be a significant contender in the final.\nPerforming before a sold-out stadium, Di Martino and Beitia finished their competition with a best of 1.99 m, leaving Vlašić, Friedrich and Chicherova to compete for the medals. The Russian took the lead, managing 2.02 m on her first attempt, while the Croatian and the German needed two and three jumps, respectively. Vlašić was the first over 2.04 m and Chicherova recorded three fouls, unable to pass the height. Friedrich, who was in third place, twice failed the height and raised the bar to 2.06 m to try to take the gold medal position. Her final effort, although close, was not enough and she finished with the bronze. Vlašić then raised the bar to the world record of 2.10 m, but failed to jump the height.\nFriedrich did not repeat the form which had seen her set a national record of 2.06 m at the Olympiastadion two months earlier, leaving Vlašić and Chicherova to repeat their gold and silver medal performances of the 2007 World Championships in Osaka. Vlašić, who became the first to win consecutive world titles in the event since Hestrie Cloete, said that she was surprised that 2.04 m had been enough for the gold medal and she expected to go much higher. Second-placed Chicherova said neither she, nor athletics commentators, had expected her to win the silver medal, but she had overcome prior injury concerns. Although gold had not materialised for Friedrich, she was happy with her bronze medal – her first at a World Championships.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 1.95 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nKey: Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best"

Previously he played for the Erie BayHawks of the NBA Development League. He played college basketball at Purdue University. In his junior season, Jackson led the Boilermakers with four assists per game and shooting 50.3 percent from the floor. As Purdue's primary point guard, he was named Honorable Mention All-Big Ten as well as a Bob Cousy Award candidate in 2011 and 2012.\nHigh school career.\nJackson attended Eisenhower High School, located in Decatur, Illinois, where he played basketball under head coach, Jeremy Moore. During his senior season, Lewis averaged 21.7 points and 10 assists a game, while being named \"Illinois' 2008 Big School Player of the Year\" by MidStateHoops.com., while finishing third for Illinois' Mr. Basketball and earning area Player of the Year honors. He was also a member of Indiana's Elite AAU squad.\nCollege career.\nPurdue.\n2008–09.\nAfter graduating high school, Jackson attended Purdue University to play under head coach, Matt Painter, along with All-Conference players in E'Twaun Moore, Robbie Hummel, and JaJuan Johnson. In his freshman season, Jackson used his speed and ball handling skills to become the team's starting point guard, where he started in 30 of the 36 games in which he appeared, while setting a school freshman record with most games played in a season. His 30 starts were two less than Russell Cross's 32 starts in 1981. Leading Purdue in assists with 3.4 a game, his 118 on the season is second most by a freshman behind Bruce Parkinson's 147 mark in 1973. On January 27, 2009, Lewis ran into a hard pick made by Wisconsin's Joe Crabbenhoft early in the game, where he sustained a concussion, forcing him to sit out a game. He scored in double figures seven times (3–4), while averaging 5.9 points per game and handing off 3.4 assists a game to lead the Boilers on the season. After leading the boilers to an 11–7 record in Big Ten play and to a 27–10 overall record and a Sweet Sixteen appearance, Lewis was named to the \"Big Ten All-Freshman Team\", along with the likes of future NBA player Byron Mullens.\n2009–10.\nIn the spring of 2009, Jackson was involved in a traffic stop in his hometown of Decatur, Illinois, resulting in community service and missing the two exhibition games, as well as the season opener. After sitting out the three designated games for his suspension, Lewis injured his foot during practice, which left him sidelined, wearing a foot cast after he received surgery. On January 28, 2010, Lewis appeared in his first game of the season in a home meeting against Wisconsin. As the team's primary point guard, he helped lead AP-ranked #6 Purdue to a 14–4 conference record (10–1 in games which he appeared) and onto a Big Ten title, the program's first in fourteen years. On March 3, 2010, Lewis had a huge performance with 9 points, 5 assists, and 3 rebounds in a win against in-state rivals, Indiana. With nine games recording four or more assists on the season, including a nine assist performance against Siena in the First Round of the NCAA tournament, where he also pulled down six rebounds and scored eight points.

On January 22, Jackson scored a new career high 19 points against Michigan State. Jackson scored in double figures eleven times. On December 20, Jackson was named a Bob Cousy Award candidate. Becoming more of a needed scoring option for the Boilers, he averaged 10.2 points a game in conference play (14–4) and helped lead the Boilers to a 2nd-place finish. Jackson was named \"Honorable Mention All-Big Ten\". He helped Purdue to the Third Round of the NCAA tournament, finishing with a 25–8 record.\n2011–12.\nJackson joined fellow seniors Robbie Hummel and Ryne Smith as tri-captains for the 2012 Purdue basketball team. Beginning the season with a troubling foot, he managed to average 12.5 points and four assists in his first four outings of the season (4–0). On November 18, 2011, against Temple, Lewis recorded a career high 26 points, shooting 8–14 from the floor and making 10 of 11 at the free throw line. Two days later, Jackson tallied a career high 9 rebounds in a loss to #15 ranked Alabama. On December 19, Jackson was named a candidate for the Bob Cousy Award for the second year in a row. Leading Purdue to a 20–11 record, Jackson averaged 10.4 points (2nd on team), 4.2 assists (1st), 1.3 steals (1st), and 3.2 rebounds (3rd), while shooting 72.8 percent at the line. In early December, Lewis began battling foot pains and back strains, forcing him to miss a majority of practice time. On the season, he's scored in double figures 16 times, which includes two 20+ point performances (2–0). Jackson held one of the best assist to turnover ratios in the nation, leading the Big Ten, while having the most career assists (451) amongst active Big Ten players, just ahead of Wisconsin's Jordan Taylor. At the culmination of the regular season, Jackson, along with teammate DJ Byrd, was named \"Honorable Mention All-Big Ten\", a repeat for Jackson. On March 9, in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten Tournament, in a loss to #7 Ohio State, Jackson dished a career high 10 assists, while recording his first double-double, scoring 10 points. In his last season at Purdue, Jackson led the Boilers to the third round of the NCAA Tournament, losing to Kansas. He led them to a 22–13 overall record on the season. During his college career, Purdue went 104–37 overall, making him the winningest starting point guard in the program's history.\nProfessional career.\nJackson went undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft. In August 2012, he signed with BC Šiauliai of Lithuania for the 2012–13 season.\nOn November 1, 2013, Jackson was selected in the fifth round of the 2013 NBA D-League draft by the Sioux Falls Skyforce. On November 21, he was waived by the Skyforce. On December 10, 2013, he was acquired by the Erie BayHawks. In 36 games for the BayHawks, he averaged 11.8 points, 4.5 rebounds, 8.9 assists and 1.1 steals per game.\nOn November 21, 2014, Jackson was acquired by the Westchester Knicks. On December 4, 2014, he was traded to the Idaho Stampede in exchange for a 2015 second round draft pick. On October 31, 2016, Jackson was re-acquired by the Erie BayHawks. In six games, he averaged 5.5 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 19 minutes. On December 23, he was traded to the Delaware 87ers in exchange for a fifth-round pick.

Canadians Priscilla Lopes-Schliep and 2003 champion Perdita Felicien were contenders for the title, and the new Oceanian record holder Sally McLellan had shown consistent form. Rounding out the favourites of the field, Jamaican athletes Brigitte Foster-Hylton and Delloreen Ennis-London were seeking to build on past championship successes.\nMichelle Perry's chance to gain a third gold ended in the heats, as she was hampered by an injury and finished seventh. Lopes-Schliep registered the fastest time of the first day, with 12.56 seconds. Harper was the fastest in the semi-finals with 12.48 seconds, a new personal best. Compatriot Cherry was the biggest name to be eliminated, unable to beat Irish athlete Derval O'Rourke to the fastest non-qualifying time.\nIn the final, Harper had a slow start and clipped the second hurdle, effectively ruling her out of the medals. Foster-Hylton, Lopes-Schliep, O'Rourke, McLellan and Ennis-London were all equal at the halfway mark. Foster-Hylton pulled away to take the gold, with Lopes-Schliep holding off Ennis London to win the silver medal. Just behind the medallists were two athletes with unexpected performances: the unfavoured O'Rourke finished fourth with an Irish record while McLellan, one of the pre-race favourites, posted a modest time for fifth place.\nFoster-Hylton's gold medal was Jamaica's first in the event on the world stage, and also made her the oldest-ever winner of the sprint hurdles at the World Championships.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the semifinals.\nKey: Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each semifinals (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final.\nKey: NR = National record, PB = Personal best, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: NR = National record, SB = Seasonal best"

        "title": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Kenya in 1983–84",
        "text": "The tour of the Bangladesh team to Kenya, during February, 1984, was the first visit of Bangladesh to any associate member country. The tour started a rivalry (between Bangladesh &amp; Kenya cricket teams) which became very intense in the 1990s. On this tour, Bangladesh drew the only 3-Day fixture, won a 2-day (over restricted) match, but won only 1 of the 5 limited over matches(That too against the Combined School XI). Overall, it was a disappointing tour for the Bangladesh side.\nThe Bangladesh team.\nThe tour followed immediately after the South East Asian Cricket cup in Bangladesh. Apart from the Bangladesh National team (which won the cup), The Bangladesh Tigers (The unofficial 'A' team, consisting mostly of youngsters) had participated in that cup. Players like, Rafiqul Alam. Minhajul Abedin Nannu, Hafizur Rahman &amp; Wahidul Gani, having done well for the tigers were included in the team for Kenya tour. The team had a nice balance of youth and experience, yet during the tour, they failed to perform up to expectations, mainly due to disunity among the players. There was conflict of interests between the younger and older members of the side.\nBangladesh performance.\nDespite the poor performance of the side Assaduzzaman Misha emerged as a bright light during the tour. Considered as not suitable for limited over game, he was not picked for the first two one-day matches. Given his chance in the 2 Day match, he scored 33 and 36. But his best came in the 3-Day match against the Kenya national XI. After the hosts posted a 300+ score, Misha led a spirited Bangladesh reply. He top scored with 68 &amp; put on 73 with Minhajul Abedin for the 1st wicket, and 71 with Gazi Ashraf for the 2nd. Surprisingly, despite this performance Misha was dropped for the One-Day Match against Kenya Cricket Association. He returned to the team for the last two matches and scored 47 &amp; 23 (top score for his side on each occasion). Following the retirement of Yousuf Rahman, at the end of the season, Misha was the undisputed No. 1 opener of the country. Unfortunately, like many others of his generation, he gave greater importance to his professional career (he was a doctor by profession). Thus, he was very rarely available for national team duty after 1985.\nLipu did well in the 2 Day and 3 Day matches. but failed in the One-Day matches. With, regular opener Yousuf Babu struggling for form, Nehal Hasnain &amp; Minhajul Abedin Nannu were tried in the opening slot.\nYousuf Rahman failed with the bat, but rather unexpectedly, he emerged as his team's most effective bowler. Badshah put on a big effort in the 3 Day match and won admiration from the opponents. Lipu and Misha did a good job as part-time spinners, but the main spin bowler Wahidul Gani was very disappointing.\nA bitter rivalry.\nThis tour started a bitter rivalry between two of the more stronger associate member nations. During the next decade or so, they met each other regularly in different ICC Trophy tournaments.\nIn 1986, both the teams performed very poorly in the tournament. But, in 1990, both the teams reached SF with Bangladeshfinishing 3rd, and Kenya 4th. They met in a vital match in the 94 ICC trophy. After their defeat at the hands of the Netherlands, it was a do or die match for Bangladesh. A narrow defeat saw them miss their chance of a WC place. Kenya eventually finished runners up (Behind UAE) and qualified for the 1996 WC in the Indian subcontinent. In !997, the two teams met in a thrilling final. With both sides already assured of WC places only pride was at stake. Bangladesh snatched a last ball victory to lift the Trophy. In July, 1997, both the nations were granted permission to play full ODIs and thus were guaranteed a place in the future WCs, so the saga of ICC Trophy ended there.\nThe only meeting between the two nations in WC cricket came at Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2003. Kenya won this match and eventually went onto reach the Semi-Finals. The old nemesis, Maurice Odumbe came back to haunt the Bangladeshi players again, with a superb all-round performance. This, however, is Kenya's last ODI win (Until July 2009), over Bangladesh. Bangladesh has dominated the recent matches.\nBangladesh vs Kenya: head to head in ODIs.\nThe first full ODI between the 2 teams took place at Nairobi, in Oct. 1997, and resulted in a crushing victory for the hosts. Chudasama (122) &amp; Kennedy Otieno (144) put on 225 for the first wicket, as the hosts rattled a huge total of 347/3 from their 50 overs. In reply, Bangladesh could only master 197. Bangladesh achieved their first ever ODI win, when they beat Kenya at Hyderabad(India)in 1998. Chasing 237 for victory, Bangladesh reached their target thanks mainly to Mohammad Rafique, who scored 77. Bangladesh's next victory over Kenya didn't come before 2006. But, since then, Bangladesh, now a full member of ICC, has totally dominated the rivalry.\nCo-operation between the rivals.\nDespite the intense rivalry between the two countries, there is also considerable cooperation as well. In early 1995, Kenya toured Bangladesh. Though, they lost most of the games, this tour gave them the opportunity to gain valuable experience about South Asian pitches and conditions. This experience helped them in their WC performance a year later. With the Bangladesh side going through some changes, following the disastrous ICC Trophy, a year earlier, this tour provided the local selectors the chance to try some youngsters.\nKenya's two most famous cricketers, Maurice Odumbe &amp; Steve Tikolo have played club cricket at Dhaka, with great distinction."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2009–10 season. It ran alongside the 2009–10 Top 14 competition; both competitions were operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nDax and Mont-de-Marsan, the two major clubs from the Landes \"département\", got relegated at the end of the previous Top 14 season and replaced Racing Métro and Albi, who gained promotion to the Top 14. This season also welcomed Lannemezan and Aix-en-Provence, respectively Fédérale 1 champions and runners-up, who took the place of Bourg-en-Bresse and Béziers, the previous year's two bottom finishers.\nAgen, who had been a favorite for promotion ever since they were relegated at the end of the 2006–07 season, finally lived up to the expectations and dominated the championship from the start, finishing with an 11-point margin over second-placed Lyon and thus earning promotion to the 2010–11 Top 14 season. Lyon and La Rochelle made the most of the home ground advantage to qualify for the promotion final with victories over Pau and Oyonnax, respectively, and faced each other in the final. La Rochelle, despite having lost both confrontations against Lyon during the regular season, triumphed 32–26 and earned the right to accompany Agen in the Top 14 after eight years spent in Pro D2.\nThe two newly promoted teams, Aix-en-Provence and Lannemezan, were not able to rival the other teams and from early on in the season occupied the bottom two places that they kept until the end. Lannemezan in particular finished with three wins out of thirty games (one of which was against arch-rivals Tarbes), amounting to 19 points, the poorest record in the Pro D2 since the introduction of the bonus points.\nHowever, in a new twist of events, Montauban, who were already relegated to Pro D2 for financial reasons (thus saving Bayonne's spot in the Top 14), failed their audit on June 10, and were further relegated to Fédérale 1. Their decision not to appeal the DNACG's ruling also meant that Aix would be reprieved and compete again in Pro D2 for the next year.\nPrevious season.\nAt the end of the previous season, Racing Métro were champions and thus automatically promoted to Top 14. They were eventually followed by Albi, who defeated Oyonnax in the final of the promotion playoffs to secure a spot in the 2009–10 Top 14. Bourg-en-Bresse, which had been newly promoted to Pro D2 for the 2008–09 season, finished second-to-bottom of the table and were initially relegated to Fédérale 1, but were further relegated by French sporting authorities to Fédérale 2 due to financial problems. Béziers finished bottom of the league; they would have however stayed in Pro D2 for the next season, had Tarbes not successfully appealed the decision of the DNACG (\"Direction nationale d'aide et de contrôle de gestion\"), the LNR's financial arm, to relegate them to Fédérale 1. The other promoted team in 2008–09, Colomiers, stayed up, finishing in 14th, the first safe spot.\nLannemezan and Aix-en-Provence earned promotion from Fédérale 1 for the 2009–10 season, while Dax and Mont-de-Marsan were relegated from the 2008–09 Top 14.\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nResults.\nKey.\nThe score of the game is given by the middle (third and fourth) columns. The first and last column indicate the number of tries scored by the home and the away team, respectively. A blue border indicates that the team has earned an attacking bonus point (i.e. has scored at least three more tries than its opponent), a yellow one that the team has earned a defensive bonus point (defeat by 7 points or less). If a team earns both bonus points, this will be indicated by a green border.\nPromotion playoffs.\nAll times CEST."

The re-formed Welsh team had seven new caps, with five first time internationals brought into the pack, Booth being one of them.

Despite the victory, Booth was replaced for the next match by Rhondda policeman Dai Evans, and never represented Wales again. In the autumn of 1898 Booth moved to England, but unlike many of his fellow players did not switch to the professional league code, but instead joined union club West Hartlepool.

        "title": "2009 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "These are the individual stages of the 2009 Vuelta a España, with Stage 1 on 29 August and Stage 11 on 9 September.\nStages.\nStage 1.\n29 August 2009 — Assen (Netherlands), 4.5 km (ITT)\nThe course for the first individual time trial was as flat as it gets; there were no rises in elevation whatsoever. The stage was one lap through TT Circuit Assen, a noted motorcycle course.\nThe early time to beat was put up by rider Markel Irizar, who stopped the clock at 5' 43\". His time was beaten by a trio of riders who came about an hour after him. For a time, the Italian team held the top three positions, with Daniele Bennati, Roman Kreuziger, and Polish national champion Maciej Bodnar, and they took the lead in the teams' classification after the stage thanks to these results. Around the time the Liquigas trio finished their rides, rain began to fall, making the course more difficult for the riders to follow. It also caused Carlos Barredo to slip and nearly fall, losing several seconds, as he left the starthouse; subsequently, turf was put down over the ramp.\nAfter Tom Boonen and Tyler Farrar in turn posted provisional best times, Olympic time trial champion Fabian Cancellara took the course and stopped the clock in 5' 20\" to win the stage and gain the first golden jersey. Cancellara expressed surprise at his win after the stage, saying he had come to the Vuelta mainly thinking of it as preparation for the world championships.\nStage 2.\n30 August 2009 — Assen (Netherlands) to Emmen (Netherlands), 202 km\nThe first mass-start stage was also very flat. A fourth-category climb to all of 30 meters in elevation was the race's first. It did not afford any points for the mountains classification, though the first rider past the climb point got the first red jersey.\nA five-rider group was away for much of this stage. This breakaway comprised Francisco José Martínez, Tom Leezer, Dominik Roels, David García, and Lieuwe Westra. Westra had tried to make the breakaway to honor his recently deceased father, and his teammates with wore black armbands in memorial as well. It was Leezer who was the first across the Relus climb to get the first mountains jersey, one that he was assured to hold through the next day, as the Stage 3 course had no categorized climbs on it.\nAll but Westra were caught with 20 kilometers left to race. Westra fought on, but was caught 9 kilometers later, leading to the widely expected field sprint finish. did most of the work going into the finish, with everyone on that team but sprinter André Greipel pulling at the front of the peloton in the stage's final 5 kilometers. In the end, Milram's Gerald Ciolek was the winner, at the head of a sprint so close Ciolek himself was unsure he had won. A selection was made in the final 2 kilometers of the stage, with Alexander Vinokourov and Samuel Sánchez notably losing 18 seconds, and other groups who had been with the peloton losing up to and over a minute.\nStage 3.\n31 August 2009 — Zutphen (Netherlands) to Venlo (Netherlands), 185 km\nThe string of Dutch flat stages continued. This course did not have a categorized climb, though it had an uncategorized hill about two-thirds of the way into the stage. The stage briefly visited Germany, and included some cobbled passages, which could have been skipped if the weather was inclement.\nThe breakaway for this stage comprised Lars Boom, Johnny Hoogerland, and Jesús Rosendo. Though the two Dutch riders were decidedly more familiar with the weather conditions and the roads the course offered, it was Rosendo who stayed out front the longest. The breakaway's maximum advantage neared ten minutes, but the peloton had no trouble catching them, with Rosendo reeled in 20 kilometers from the finish. set up the sprint in the stage's final kilometers, just as they had all season, but it was not their main sprinter André Greipel who took the win, but rather leadout man Greg Henderson. Henderson was intending to lead Greipel in, but when he did not see the German in the stage's final 150 meters, he sprinted for the win himself, and edged out Borut Božič at the line. It was 's 72nd win of the season.\nStage 4.\n1 September 2009 — Venlo (Netherlands) to Liège (Belgium), 224 km\nThis was another flat stage, though it had three fourth-category climbs. It visited some of the same roads used yearly by the Amstel Gold Race and Liège–Bastogne–Liège. With this stage finish, Liège is the only city that can boast having hosted stages of the Giro d'Italia, the Tour de France, and now the Vuelta. After this stage, the riders traveled by plane to Catalonia for the continuation of the Vuelta on Spanish soil.\nWith the three fourth-category climbs on course offering the Vuelta's first mountains points, this was an important stage in which to make the breakaway. Not only would the mountains classification red jersey go to a member of this breakaway, but so too would the combination classification white jersey, as qualification for it would be restricted to riders who had scored points in the mountains classification. The four who made the breakaway were Javier Ramírez, Lars Boom, Dominik Roels, and Sergey Lagutin. Boom topped two of the three climbs in first position to gain the red jersey, while Roels wound up in white. The breakaway's maximum advantage over the peloton was over 14 minutes, but still the peloton easily caught them long before the finish, with some 30 kilometers to go. After several attempted escapes, the end of this stage was again a field sprint, won this time by the man who was denied by a teammate the day before, André Greipel. A big crash caused majority of the field to fall or jam behind, which caused the top seven to be of riders from only two teams.\nThe day was marked by consistent rainfall, which made the stage's final few kilometers perilous. Many riders crashed, including Jakob Fuglsang, who lost control of his bike and ran into a parked truck. While Fuglsang was able to continue, Charly Wegelius, Chris Horner, and Robert Kišerlovski would all put out before the race reached Spain. Many other riders sustained minor injuries, and the coming rest day, uncharacteristically early coming after four flat stages, was welcomed by much of the peloton.\nRest/travel day.\n2 September 2009\nStage 5.\n3 September 2009 — Tarragona to Vinaròs, 174 km\nThe first stage in the Tour of Spain to actually take place in Spain, this course offered the first real climb for the riders, the second-category Alto de Fatxas soon after the stage begun. A breakaway had already gained a lead of 4:30 before reaching the climb. The breakaway consisted of Julián Sánchez, Aitor Hernández, José Antonio Lopez Gil, Julien El Fares, Matthé Pronk and Serafín Martínez. The group collected the set of climber's points for the day, with Aitor Hernández collecting the maximum to take the red jersey. On behalf of the sprinters, Stijn Devolder of lead the charge the catch the breakaway group. They were caught with 30 km to go. David de la Fuente and Philippe Gilbert both tried to make a late move at 7 km to go, but the led peloton gave them no more than a 20-second advantage. Once the sprinters launched their assault, Tom Boonen looked to have the advantage, but André Greipel overtook him in the last few meters to take his second consecutive win and acquire both the green and yellow jerseys.\nStage 6.\n4 September 2009 — Xàtiva, 186 km\nThis out-and-back stage in Xàtiva includes two third-category climbs never before visited in the Vuelta. The course concludes with the Vuelta's first finishing circuit, two laps which end at Xàtiva's Castle National Monument.\nStage 7.\n5 September 2009 — Valencia, 30 km (ITT)\nThe first race of any substance against the clock takes place on a Formula One urban racing circuit. It is almost perfectly flat, with only the gentlest of rises in elevation coming halfway into the circuit.\nStage 8.\n6 September 2009 — Alzira to Alto de Aitana, 206 km\nThis is a difficult stage, with seven categorized climbs on course (three second-category and four third-category) serving as a warm-up for the special-category Alto de Aitana at the finish. The course is also longer than most typical mountain stages in a Grand Tour, at 206 km, and figures to be the Vuelta's first truly selective stage. This stage produced one of the biggest shocks of the race so far with the retirement of Andy Schleck, a pre-race favourite.\nStage 9.\n7 September 2009 — Alcoy to Xorret de Catí, 188 km\nThe ninth stage of the Vuelta takes place between Alcoi and Xorret del Catí. The stage has a similar layout to that of the previous day: many mountain climbs and a mountain finish. However, this time the climb is not as long and steep as Aitana: Xorret del Catí is a short, explosive climb that requires sprockets of 25 and even 27 teeth.\nStage 10.\n8 September 2009 — Alicante to Murcia, 186 km\nThis stage started high in elevation and undulated a little before a drastic descent about two-thirds of the way into the course. The Alto de la Cresta del Gallo just before the finish kept the sprinters' teams from having anything to say on this day.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA breakaway of 19 riders formed early in the race, but consecutive attacks on the Alto de la Cresta del Gallo produced a group of four that held on until the finish. Alexander Vinokourov, Ryder Hesjedal, Simon Gerrans and Jakob Fuglsang worked together until the finish was in sight. They then came close to a standstill as the leading riders began to jockey for a drafting position for the start of the sprint.

The course has three categorized climbs, one each in the first, second, and third categories, and none of which have been visited in the Vuelta previously."

        "text": "These are the individual stages of the 2009 Vuelta a España, with Stage 12 on 11 September and Stage 21 on 20 September.\nStages.\nStage 12.\n11 September 2009 — Almería to Alto de Velefique, 174 km\nComing out of the second rest day, the peloton gets a course with over 3,500 meters in total climbing. It includes two visits to the Alto de Velefique, one coming after 55 km and the other at the finish line. There is another first and a third-category climb on the day.\nStage 13.\n12 September 2009 — Berja to Sierra Nevada, 175 km\nThis is undoubtedly the queen stage of the 2009 Vuelta. The special-category Alto de Sierra Nevada at the finish is, at 2,520 metres, the highest point reached in the race. But it is far from all this course has to offer – the deceptively difficult and steep third-category Alto de Berja comes almost immediately and is followed by the first-category Puerto de la Ragua. The Vuelta has never before gone over the Puerto de la Ragua from this side, and it is more difficult than climbing it from the opposite side. Another first-category climb, the Alto de Monachil, occurs near the end of the stage, though it is essentially just the halfway point to the Alto de Sierra Nevada.\nStage 14.\n13 September 2009 — Granada to La Pandera, 157 km\nThe riders have one more high mountain stage to go through before making it back to flat lands. Two third-category climbs and several uncategorized rises precede another special-category summit stage finish at the Sierra de La Pandera.\nStage 15.\n14 September 2009 — Jaén to Córdoba, 168 km\nThis stage is branded as flat, though it begins at about 600 meters in elevation before descending to the valley below. It also includes the second-category Alto del Catorce por Ciento (which, despite its name, does not feature 14% gradients) 20 km from the finish.\nStage 16.\n15 September 2009 — Córdoba to Puertollano, 170 km\nThis is the easiest stage the peloton will have seen since Catalonia, with only two early third-category climbs to disrupt an otherwise flat overall profile.\nStage 17.\n16 September 2009 — Ciudad Real to Talavera de la Reina, 175 km\nThis stage was thought to be a hard-fought reward for whichever sprinters fought their way through the heights wrought by the Vuelta's second week – it did not feature a single categorized climb. It was expected to see a mass sprint finish.&lt;br&gt; Contrary to expectations, 's Anthony Roux was able to hold off the chasing peloton to take the win by just a few meters.\nStage 18.\n17 September 2009 — Talavera de la Reina to Ávila, 175 km\nThis course has four categorized climbs, three of which are new to the Vuelta. The selection should take place on the first-category Puerto de Mijares, which comes at the halfway point of the stage.\nStage 19.\n18 September 2009 — Ávila to La Granja de San Ildefonso, 175 km\nThis is the Vuelta's last mountain stage. It includes two passes over the first-category Puerto de Navacerrada, the second of which crests 17 km from the finish. There is also quite a lot of descending to do on this stage, as the four categorized climbs all begin and end at roughly the same elevation. The finish comes on the descent from the last pass over the Puerto de Navacerrada.\nStage 20.\n19 September 2009 — Toledo, 26 km (ITT)\nThe course for the final time trial is flat, with very gentle undulation.\nStage 21.\n20 September 2009 — Rivas-Vaciamadrid to Madrid, 110 km\nThe Vuelta ended, by tradition, much like the Tour de France does, with a flat and largely ceremonial road stage. It ended in downtown Madrid at the Plaza de Cibeles."

The Russian steeplechase team entered for the event was particularly strong, featuring world record holder and Olympic champion Gulnara Galkina, defending world champion Yekaterina Volkova, and third fastest of the year Yuliya Zarudneva. Other possible medallists included Marta Domínguez, who had the world-leading time prior to the competition, American record holder Jenny Barringer, and world junior record holder Ruth Bisibori.\nOn the first day of competition, Galkina won heat one, with Germany's Antje Möldner finishing not far behind with a national record-breaking run. African athletes Zemzem Ahmed and Gladys Kipkemoi shared the winning time in the second heat, a race which saw the defending champion Volkova eliminated from the competition.\nIn the final, the favourite Galkina led upon the final lap, when Domínguez and Zarudneva sped ahead of the field. Domínguez kicked in the final straight to take her first World Championship gold medal in 9:07.32. This was a Spanish record and the fourth fastest of all time, in what was only her ninth race in the steeplechase. Zarudneva held on for the silver medal and Milcah Chemos Cheywa, a Kenyan newcomer, took the bronze, both athletes with a personal best. The former champion Galkina had faded into fourth place, and out of the medals. A number of athletes in the rest of the field recorded personal bests, with highlights including Habiba Ghribi and Antje Möldner running national records, and Jennifer Barringer setting a new North American record.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found Domínguez guilty of an anti-doping rule violation and ordered that all competitive results obtained by Domínguez from 5 August 2009 be disqualified. Earlier in 2015, silver medalist Yuliya Zarudneva (now known as Zaripova) received a doping ban that did not backdate to the 2009 World Championships, therefore Zarudneva was not advanced to gold\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat (Q) and the next 3 fastest (q) advance to the final.\nKey: NR = National record, PB = Personal best, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: AR = Area record, NR = National record, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)\nNote: Marta Domínguez was disqualified in November 2015.

The event was won by Jury Chechi of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's rings since 1924 (and second overall) and first medal in the event since 1964.

However, all 7 could compete on each apparatus for individual competition purposes. Other nations could enter up to 3 individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus (except for any apparatus in which a team member was not competing). The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around qualifying score for those gymnasts competing on every apparatus. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 105th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nNinety-five gymnasts competed in the horizontal bar event during the compulsory and optional rounds on July 20 and 22. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 29. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 20, 22 and 24th at the Georgia Dome. There were 111 competitors from 31 nations. Each nation could enter a team of 7 gymnasts (up from 6 in previous Games) or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Li Xiaoshuang of China, the nation's first victory in the event and first medal of any color since 1984. Two nations making their debut as independent nations after the dissolution of the Soviet Union took silver (Alexei Nemov of Russia) and bronze (Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus). Scherbo had won the event as a member of the Unified Team in 1992; he was the 11th man to earn multiple all-around medals.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSeven of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1992 Games returned: gold medalist Vitaly Scherbo of the Unified Team (now representing Belarus), bronze medalist Valery Belenky of the Unified Team (now competing for Germany), fourth-place finisher Andreas Wecker of Germany, fifth-place finisher Li Xiaoshuang of China, eighth-place finisher Lee Joo-Hyung of South Korea, and ninth-place finishers Han Yun-su of South Korea and Szilveszter Csollány of Hungary. Li was the reigning (1995) World Champion; Scherbo had won in 1993, taken third in 1994, and finished second behind Li in 1995. Li recognized Alexei Nemov of Russia (relatively unknown in all-around but with strong results in each apparatus at the 1996 World Championships, which had no all-around event) as a bigger contender in Atlanta than Scherbo, however.\nArmenia, Barbados, Belarus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. France made its 20th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 competition followed the revised format from 1992, which ended the carryover of preliminary scores to the final. The preliminary round and final round were separate. In the preliminary round (which also served as the team all-around competition as well as the qualifying round for the individual apparatus events), each gymnast performed a compulsory exercise and an optional exercise on each apparatus. (Many gymnasts from nations competing in the team event opted not to compete on each apparatus, as the team event required designating only 6 of the 7 as team competitors on each apparatus, reducing the incentive for specialists on one apparatus to compete on all others.) The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. The top 36 gymnasts advanced to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these six exercise scores resulted in a final total. Each exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. The final total, with six exercises, was from 0 to 60.\nResults.\nAll 111 gymnasts were ranked by their totals in the preliminary round, though only 74 completed all 12 exercises during the all-around during the compulsory and optional rounds on July 20 and 22. The 36 highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 24. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final."

One particularly major development was the total elimination of compulsories for all artistic gymnasts in all future competitions after these Olympics. Also, these would be the first and last Olympics to use the “7–6–5” format, which meant “SEVEN members where SIX would compete and the FIVE top scores would count towards team total” on each apparatus, for their team competitions, and for teams to consist of seven members. From the next Olympics onwards, teams would revert to competing with six members again.\nQualification.\nThe top 12 teams at the 1995 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships earned places in the team all-around competition."

        "title": "Little League World Series on television",
        "text": "The Little League World Series is broadcast on television by ABC and ESPN, along with their family of networks. They also televise the regional championships, which precede the Little League World Series.\nBroadcast history.\nThe ABC television network began televising a tape-delayed Little League World Series Championship Game on an annual basis in 1963. From 1965 to 1985, the championship game was broadcast during the weekend, airing under ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" umbrella.\nIn 1982, Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) began expanding their cable television network through increased coverage of sports entertainment on a global scale. During this time, ESPN's brand and its family of networks, began covering the Little League World Series games in a greater capacity. A total of 12 games were televised by the network in 2000, resulting in nationwide popularity of the game, which provided opportunities to expand the total number of teams from eight to 16.\nIn 2001, ESPN covered all eight U.S. regional championships. This was as a result of a second stadium, Volunteer Stadium, which allowed games to take place simultaneously. Also that year, ABC began televising the U.S. Championship Game. That year, ESPN aired a total of 25 games. In 2003, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 carried a total of 35 games including regional championships. All games aired on any ESPN network are also available via Internet streaming on ESPN3.\nOne of the most prominent announcers was Harold Reynolds. Former major league baseball player and color commentator Tony Gwynn referred to him as \"the Pied Piper of Little League baseball.\" Some of the game broadcasters and play-by-play commentators have included sportscasters Al Michaels and Brent Musburger, American sports journalist Jim McKay, and former major league baseball players Cy Young Award and World Series MVP Orel Hershiser, and Hall of Fame baseball players Johnny Bench, Mickey Mantle and Jim Palmer.\nProgramming successes.\nThe Poynter Institute was hired by ESPN to write about their programming, from an outsider's perspective. This blog became known as The Poynter Review Project. The report concludes that the Little League World Series is a good thing for ESPN, fans, and the players.\nThe Poynter Review Project stated that there was no reason for ESPN to shy away from the fact that the kids were crying. The project maintained that crying is actually a healthy emotion, and one that boys at this age should feel comfortable expressing. Adults should use those opportunities to reinforce that these emotions are normal and healthy responses to such a moment of either disappointment or achievement. Furthermore, the project asserted that not crying during such moments is actually an unhealthy response. The project also found no evidence that these boys develop mental health issues later on in life as a result of playing in this tournament, maintaining a variety of reasons to enjoy watching these young athletes compete at the highest level.\nESPN has now gone away from trying to show kids crying due to the previous criticism they received from viewers.\nProgramming concerns.\nWhile there has been documented successes of the Little Leagues World Series, there have also been detractors of the sports program that believe that there is too much exposure for the Little League World Series, especially the effect it has on the participants. ESPN's Tim Scanlon defended the network's coverage, \"We're not trying to hide or patronize the coverage... but you don't want to sensationalize those moments. It's about the experience and the competition. It's pure. It's almost innocent.\"\nBill Plaschke is a Los Angeles Times sports writer who also contributes to ESPN from time to time. He has written an article about the exploitation witnessed during a televised game of the Little League World Series. He describes in detail situations, such as children pouting in an attempt to hold themselves together in tough situations, parents yelling at the players, all which is aired in what can be perceived as an exploitation of their situations, for which there are many examples of in television. Plaschke says the blame is not on the networks, but on the Little League itself because if ESPN or ABC did not show the games then some other network would. Plaschke also said we just don't need to see it, and they don't need us to see it. Cameras do not help already tense situations, arbitrarily deter from what matters, and unjustly exploit. The cameras change everything for kids who just aren't ready for it. He brings up the point that no other league exploits their kids at such an early age. Most of these kids are between the age of 11–12. The earliest you see football and basketball stars are High school, and you cannot see hockey stars till college. A lot of this may have to do with popularity, and money, but that is why Plaschke blames the League the most for this.\nThe pressures of these kids mirror those of a major league baseball team on any given day. On most days these kids are playing in front of crowds of 45,000 people who are hanging onto their every pitch. This is more fans than some major league teams can only dream about having in their own stadiums. Most of the star pitchers are throwing about 200 pitches on short rest which is something that you will never even see anymore in the major leagues.\nThe pressure is not limited to the fans at the park. According to Biz of Baseball the 2009 had 1.56 million viewers. This was a 60% increase from the year before."

        "text": "The women's 800 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on 16, 17 and 19 August. Prior to the championships, there was no clear favourite for the race – the twenty fastest times of the season had been run by seventeen different athletes. The reigning World and Olympic champions, Janeth Jepkosgei and Pamela Jelimo, had not shown the dominance of previous seasons. The two fastest runners of the season, Caster Semenya and Maggie Vessey, had recently set personal bests but lacked any major championships experience, while third best Anna Alminova was a 1500 metres specialist. European Indoor Champion Mariya Savinova and Svetlana Klyuka, fourth at the Olympics, were other strong competitors. The 2007 World medallists Hasna Benhassi and Mayte Martínez, and Olympic finalist Yuliya Krevsun were also predicted as medal possibilities.\nThe events in the heats resulted in a surprise decision: world-leader Semenya accidentally tripped Jepkosgei and the defending champion finished last in the first heat. The Kenyan athletics federation appealed the decision and she was reinstated to run in the second semi-final, and Semenya was not disqualified as her actions were deemed unintentional. Yuliya Krevsun, Elisa Cusma Piccione, and Zulia Calatayud were the fastest of the heat winners on the first day of competition. With only eight places on offer, there were a number of high-profile scalps in the semi-finals. The first race saw past medallists Calatayud and Benhassi fail to qualify, Svetlana Klyuka was fifth in the second heat, while Vessey and Jelimo dropped out in the third semi-final of the day. Caster Semenya was the fastest in the preliminaries with 1:58.66.\nIn the final, Semenya lead the race from the halfway mark, and continued to increase her lead from that point onwards, winning her first World Championship gold medal in a time of one minute and 55.45 seconds. Krevsun was in second place near the end of final straight, but she faded a little and allowed Jepkosgei and Jenny Meadows to challenge her position. With just a tenth of a second between second and fourth, Krevsun fell behind the Kenyan and British athletes, who ended up with the silver and bronze medals.\nSemenya's victory was one of the focal points of the championship, not just because of her achievement on the track at such a young age, but also because of the events that followed. Having beaten her previous 800 m best by four seconds at the African Junior Championships just a month earlier, her quick improvements came under scrutiny. The combination of her rapid athletic progression and her appearance culminated in the IAAF asking her to take a gender test to ascertain whether she was female. A number of South African governing bodies came to the defence of Semenya, saying the athlete had been treated unfairly, and world record holder Michael Johnson was highly critical of the way that the sensitive issue had been dealt with publicly.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat(Q) and the next 6 fastest(q) advance to the semi-finals.\nKey: NR = National record, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nSemi-finals.\nJaneth Jepkosgei was tripped in the first round heats, and after protest by the Kenyan Federation, was added to the semi-finals; she will run in lane 7 of heat 2 along with Hazel Clark.

The event featured four athletes whose ability was so much better than the opposition that Mirko Jalava of the IAAF said it would be a \"major surprise\" should another athlete beat them to the podium.\nThe Olympic champion and world record holder Barbora Špotáková, and Beijing silver medallist Mariya Abakumova, had not matched their Olympic form of the previous year but remained strong contenders for the competition. The other two athletes came from the German team, which was headed by world-leader and two-time World medallist Christina Obergföll, as well as the veteran Steffi Nerius who won silver in 2003, 2005 and 2007. Osleidys Menéndez, Sunette Viljoen and Madara Palameika were the outside contenders.\nA modest qualifying round was highlighted by Abakumova's world-leading throw of 68.92 m, while German number three Linda Stahl and Slovenian Martina Ratej threw season's bests to qualify as the second and third best throwers. The first round saw the elimination of two of the season's top-six athletes, Palameika and Viljoen. On the final day, Nerius opened the competition in style with a season's best 67.30 m on her first throw, while Špotáková and Monica Stoian completed the top three with 64.94 and 64.51 m respectively. With a throw of 65.39 m Mariya Abakumova moved into the bronze medal position, and she would remain there for the rest of the event. Obergföll and Stahl moved into the top six in round three, but the positions remained static thereafter. Neither Špotáková nor Abakumova (whose qualifying throw would have won the final) could find the form to dislodge Nerius from the gold medal spot. The 37-year-old German won her first ever World Championship gold medal in Berlin, in what was her final year in competitive athletics.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying distance 62.00 (Q) or the least 12 best athletes and ties (q) advance to the final.\nKey: Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)\nFinal.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best"

        "text": "The Keweenaw Mountain Lodge and Golf Course Complex is a resort located near Copper Harbor, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1976 listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and open to the public.\nDescription.\nThe Keweenaw Mountain Lodge Complex covers , and consists of multiple buildings, including the main lodge and 23 cabins. A golf course, constructed at the same time as the lodge and cabins, covers much of the remaining land. Mountain bike trails and a disc golf course have been added in recent years. All structures within the district are unified by their rustic construction; the structures have low gable roofs and are made using rough-cut stone and dark painted logs.\nHistory.\nDuring the early 1930s, the Great Depression hit Keweenaw County hard. The mining industry had fallen on hard times, and unemployment stood at over seventy percent. Ocha Potter, the head of the Keweenaw County Road Commission and superintendent of Ahmeek Mine, conceived of constructing a resort complex in the county. In 1933, he applied to the federal government for funding under the newly created Civil Works Administration. The county Board of Park Trustees had previously negotiated purchase of of land from the Keweenaw Copper Company, situated about south of Copper Harbor.\nClearing of the forest cover began in the winter of 1933/34, and the stumps were cleared as the weather let up. The logs from the property were used construct the lodge. By the end of 1934, the lodge was nearly completed and the first nine holes of the golf course were cleared and seeded. (A second planned nine holes was never completed.) In 1935, another project to build 20 cabins was approved by the Works Progress Administration, which were completed during the next few years. Four additional cottages were built in 1947/48 using profits from the operation of the lodge.\nIn July 2018, Keweenaw County will auction off the lodge.\nSignificance.\nThe lodge complex was designed and built in 1934 and 1935, in the depths of the Great Depression, using crews of local workmen. The construction was overseen by Keweenaw County and used federal relief money. The site is an example of government-funded work projects designed to boost local economies, and is significant in its effort to protect and maintain the environment while offering recreational opportunity."

Kaniskina emerged as the clear winner, becoming the first woman to win the racewalking gold in consecutive championships. Forty-nine seconds behind her was the surprise silver medallist Olive Loughnane, who won Ireland's first championship medal since 2003, and her first ever medal at a major championships. Liu Hong took the bronze, while Russian teenager Kirdyapkina took fourth place.\nKaniskina's victory completed a Russian men's and women's 20 km double with Valeriy Borchin, and she received a winner's prize of $60,000 for her achievement. Her win highlighted her success in an event in which she had won an Olympic gold, two World Championships titles, and a gold in the World Cup in just three years.\nOn January 15, 2015, Kaniskina's results were disqualified for doping violations. Most of the athletes coached by Viktor Chegin have received similar bans. On July 6, 2016, Loughnane will receive the gold medal in a full ceremony at the 2016 European Athletics Championships.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Fred Lorenzen, driving a 1965 Ford, won the race from fourth position in a two-hour-and-23-minute time span by Darel Dieringer by a full lap. There were 3 cautions flags which slowed the race for 43 laps. The race ended on lap 133 due to persistent rain. This was Lorenzen's first victory of the season.\nSafety innovations.\nNASCAR instituted new rules in October 1964 to enhance safety and decrease speeds for 1965 after the previous year's deaths of Joe Weatherly and Fireball Roberts. The Chrysler Hemi engine was dominated that year by 1964 NASCAR Champion Richard Petty.\nFord Motor Company wanted a new engine with high-rise cylinder heads to compete with the Hemi and threatened to pull out if Bill France Sr. didn't allow it. NASCAR's new rules, however, banned both Hemi engines and high-rise cylinder heads.\nSpeedweeks.\nDarel Dieringer won the pole with a speed of in Bud Moore's 1964 Mercury, then held off Ned Jarrett's move in the final turn to win the first qualifying race. the second race became a duel between Fred Lorenzen and Junior Johnson. Lorenzen took the lead on lap 39. But when he roared under the white flag, he mistook it for the checkered flag. Lorenzen let off and Johnson passed him on the last lap to win. The second qualifying race featured a wild first lap crash as Ron Eulenfeld triggered a wild crash that also took out 12 other cars in the race. Eulenfeld walked away from that crash.\nRace Day.\nOn Race day, Junior Johnson grabbed the lead on the first lap from his second starting spot and led the first 27 laps. at that car 14 cars were out all because of mechanical problems. Johnson was racing in his usual go-for-broke style when a tire blew. Johnson's car hurled into the outside wall and spread debris over a wide area. Johnson suffered only a cut over his eye. After Johnson's abrupt departure, 1961 winner Marvin Panch led through lap 68 in the Wood Brothers Ford, with Lorenzen and Bobby Johns on his tail. Lorenzen led laps 69 through 78 before giving way to Panch.\nAt halfway, Panch was still in control, but clouds were darkening over the track. On lap 119, Lorenzen edged past Panch and took the lead for only the second time. Rain was falling by Lap 129. As the yellow light came on, Panch made a run on Lorenzen coming off turn two. Panch went to the outside, Lorenzen moved up, the cars touched and Panch spun down the backstretch, ending his chances for a second 500 victory.\nLorenzen remained in the lead, but the fender that had hit Panch's car was bent in on his tire. \"Stay out\", ordered crew chief Herb Nab, who was counting on the weather to shorten the race. Soon, it was pouring. The race was stopped after 133 laps and declared official. The \"Golden Boy\" had won NASCAR's biggest race."

Petty drove his number 43 to victory in just over three hours after starting the race on the pole. There were four caution flags which slowed the race for 22 laps. Petty came from two laps down to win the event after 198 laps were completed. The race was shortened by two laps due to rain. The win was Petty's second victory of the season.\n1966 season.\nThe 1966 season marked the return of the Chrysler Hemi engine in NASCAR competition, while Ford took a one-year leave from competition before realizing that the ploy was detrimental to their sales. The 1966 Daytona 500 was the fifth event of 49 in the 1966 season, which included the two qualifying races for the 500. The 1966 season opened in Augusta with Petty taking the win in the season inaugural event. Dan Gurney followed with a win in Riverside before the drivers and their teams ventured to Daytona International Speedway for the event. NASCAR ran a total of 49 events, ending at the Rockingham Speedway in October. David Pearson won the NASCAR Grand National Series Championship after winning 15 events while 168 drivers competed in at least one event during the 1966 season.\nBackground.\nQualifying.\nRichard Petty captured the pole position for the event with a speed of . The two 100 mile qualifying events were won by Paul Goldsmith driving a number 99 1965 Plymouth, who bested second-place finisher Richard Petty, and Earl Balmer driving his number 3 1965 Dodge. A total of 50 drivers started the Daytona 500 in 1966, and a total of 18 cars were still running at the conclusion of the race.\nQualifying race results\nFirst qualifier\nSecond qualifier\nThe Race.\nAfter starting on the 1966 Daytona 500 pole, Petty went on to lead the first six laps of the event, before relinquishing the lead to Paul Goldsmith, who had started in the third position. Petty and Goldsmith swapped the lead back and forth a total of four times before Dick Hutcherson drove his number 29 1966 Ford into the lead on lap 34. Petty suffered from tire problems early in the race, yet work by his pit crew, and having one of the fastest cars allowed him to work his way back to the front of the field. In 2008 Petty said: \"...we was the quickest car all week long. That car, again, like the '64 car, was just a real fast car, and we just outrun everybody.\" Petty returned to the lead on lap 97 when he overtook Goldsmith. A total of 6 drivers exchanged the lead 15 times throughout the event, with Petty, Goldsmith, Hutcherson, Cale Yarborough, Marvin Panch, Jim Hurtubise all leading at least one lap. On lap 113 Petty took the lead for the final time, and went on to finish more than a full lap ahead of second-place finisher Yarborough. Petty went on to lead a race-high 108 laps by the time the checkered flag fell.\nThe victory by Petty was his second at the Daytona International Speedway, having won the event in 1964. Richard Petty's victory at the 1966 Daytona 500 was the first and only time that he captured the pole position, despite winning the event a record seven times. As of 2009, Richard Petty is the only driver to win the event seven times: 1964, 1966, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, and 1981. The driver with the second highest number of victories would be Cale Yarborough, with a total of 4 victories; 1968, 1977, 1983 and 1984.

Cale Yarborough won the race from the pole\nSummary.\nThe event was won by Cale Yarborough driving a 1968 Mercury. Yarborough drove his #21 to victory in just over 3 hours and 23 minutes after starting the race on the pole. There were 11 caution flags which slowed the race for 60 laps, a track record at the time that remained so until 2005. Yarborough squeaked out the victory by less than a second over LeeRoy Yarbrough. The win was Yarborough's first victory of the season and his first victory in the \"Great American Race\".\nThis was also the only Daytona 500 where the grid was set exclusively by qualifying times. The 125-mile qualifying races were not held due to inclement weather.\nFirst Daytona 500 starts for Andy Hampton, Buddy Arrington, Bill Seifert, Dave Marcis, (Marcis would make every Daytona 500 until 2000), Earl Brooks, Dick Johnson, Dr. Don Tarr, and Dub Simpson. Only Daytona 500 starts for Al Unser, Bob Senneker, Butch Hartman, Larry Manning, Rod Eulenfeld, Charles Burnett, Don Biederman, Stan Meserve, and Bud Moore. Last Daytona 500 starts for Darel Dieringer, Clyde Lynn, Sam McQuagg, Mario Andretti, Sonny Hutchins, Bob Cooper, Jerry Grant, Paul Lewis, Roy Tyner, and H. B. Bailey.\nThis was the race in which Junior Johnson cost his own team the race. Cale ran out of gas at some point in the race and overshot his pit as the crew wasn't expecting him. Junior Johnson was standing out waiting for Leeroy to come and he managed to put just enough gas to get Cale back around to his put.\nAl Unser led a lap in this one; it became the only time that he led a NASCAR race in his career. Dub Simpson earned a dubious distinction by becoming the only driver ever to fail to complete a lap in the race. This was also Bob \"The Sneaker\" Senneker's best career NASCAR finish, where he finished in 13th place. Richard Petty and his \"mysterious\" black vinyl roof actually ran pretty good and led the race until James Hylton blew a tire and ended up in the turn 1 wall. A piece of debris from Hylton's car hit Petty's and knocked the roof loose starting a day of troubles for Richard's team because of their experiment. Petty would finish the race two laps behind the drivers on the lead lap.\nThe transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \"strictly stock\" vehicles of the 1950s."

        "title": "1975–76 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and the United States",
        "text": "The 1975–76 Australia rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland was a series of matches played by the Australia national rugby union team (nicknamed the Wallabies). The team was referred to as the \"Sixth Wallabies\", although they were actually only the fifth Australian touring team to undertake a full tour of Britain &amp; Ireland; the \"Second Wallabies\" of 1939–40 had to return home without playing a game when the World War II broke out.\nThe Wallabies played twenty-six matches between October 1975 and January 1976, including one match in the United States. Australia won nineteen games, drew one and lost six. They were generally unsuccessful in the four international matches in Europe, losing the first three and winning only the final fixture against Ireland. In their other matches they lost to Cardiff, England's Midlands (East) representative team and the Barbarians in the traditional final match of the European leg of the tour.\nThe squad's leadership.\nAustralia's world-class halfback John Hipwell had first toured with the Wallabies in 1966–67 and had captained his state and country on several occasions since 1973. He was an automatic selection as captain for the 26 match tour. Hipwell would captain the team in two Tests (Scotland and Wales) and in nine mid-week matches. An injury he suffered in the North-Eastern Counties game resulted in serious damage to the cruciate ligaments in his leg, caused him to be replaced in the Wales Test and ended his playing involvement on tour after the game against the Combined Services.\nCentre Geoff Shaw took over the captaincy from Hipwell and led the side in six mid-week matches as well as the England, Ireland and United States Tests. Tony Shaw took a leadership role in the forwards playing in nineteen matches and was the only back-rower to play in all Tests.\nThe tour manager was 33-year-old Newcastle solicitor Ross Turnbull, who had won a single Wallaby cap as a prop against Scotland on the short tour to Ireland &amp; Scotland in 1968. The Rothmans Rugby Yearbook asserts that he managed the side \"splendidly\" and \"did much to make his side one of the most popular ever to visit Britain\".\nThe tour coach was 47-year-old David Brockhoff who as per Wallaby tour tradition, carried the official title of Assistant-Manager. The flamboyant Brockhoff had been capped eight times as a Wallaby between 1949 and 1951. Rothmans Rugby Yearbook stated \"[He] played a big part in the team's success. He was a dynamic, driving force, often against considerable difficulties\".\nTour itinerary.\nThe tour followed a by-then well established pattern for touring teams to Europe from the Southern Hemisphere. Australia played test matches against all four Home Nations and a number of other matches against Welsh clubs and representative teams, Irish provinces, Scottish district teams and combinations of English county sides. The tour opened as was customary with a match against a university team, Oxford on this occasion, and by tradition took in a match just after Christmas against a Combined Services team selected from the Army, RAF and Royal Navy; on previous tours this had been played at Twickenham, but was now held at Aldershot.\nThe final fixture in Europe was another traditional match, the tourist game against the Barbarians, which had begun at the end of 1947–48 Wallaby tour as a fund-raising game. The tourists were guests a Sportsman's Luncheon at the Savoy Hotel in London where dignitaries included Sir Douglas Bader.\nAfter leaving Europe the Wallabies played a match against the United States national rugby union team, for which the Australian players were awarded full international caps. This was the first match played by a United States national team since the 1924 Summer Olympic Games; the United States rugby union (now USA Rugby) had been founded in 1975.\nTest matches.\nScotland.\nScotland opened the scoring against the run of play in the 26th minute with a try in the corner from Lewis Dick, set up by McGeechan and Hay. Morgan was unable to convert. Scotland's second try, just before half time, was scored by Jim Renwick after a 40-yard run when a pass from Hipwell to McLean went astray. Morgan converted this time to put Scotland 10–0 up at half time. Rothmans Yearbook commented \"with luck [Australia] could have been 10 points up instead\". Scotland dominated the territory in the second half but were unable to add to their score; McLean's 35-yard penalty goal for Australia was the only score of the half to make the result 10–3 to Scotland.\nWales.\nWales dominated the line-outs and rucks to record what was at the time their biggest win and highest score against Australia. An Edwards try from close range, converted by Fenwick, and a Fenwick penalty goal gave Wales a 9–3 half-time lead, Australia's score coming from a McLean penalty goal. The Australian captain Hipwell had to go off just before half-time with a recurrence of his knee ligament injury, a loss which Rothmans Yearbook suggested might have \"affected the margin but not the result\". In the second half J.J. Williams scored a hat-trick of tries with Fenwick and Martin adding a conversion each. Bevan scored a dropped goal and Wales finished 28–3 winners. Rothmans concluded that \"Australia fought hard to the end, but on the day met a team which was too good for them at all points\". Phil Bennett was selected at fly-half for Wales but withdrew after suffering an injury playing for Llanelli and was replaced by John Bevan.\nEngland.\nAustralia had won both international matches on the 1975 England rugby union tour of Australia but were beaten at Twickenham and failed to score a try for the third successive international on tour. Hipwell, Price and Fay were all unavailable due to injury. Hignell's two penalty goals for England to one by McLean made the half-time score 6–3. This remained unchanged until the 67th minute when England debutant Corless scored a try after chasing his own kick to make it 10–3. Five minutes later another player making his first appearance, Lampkowski, scored a try after a scrum near the Australian line and Duckham added a third try which was converted by Hignell, who also scored a penalty goal in the second half. The only Australia score in the second half was another McLean penalty goal. England's 23 points was at the time their highest score against Australia, and the 17-point winning margin equalled their record margin against the Wallabies.\nIreland.\nAustralia registered their first international victory of the tour and scored three tries in beating Ireland. The first half ended with Ireland in a narrow 7–6 lead from McMaster's try and Robbie's penalty goal to two penalty goals from McLean; new Irish cap Ollie Campbell missed three penalties which might have given Ireland a more comfortable lead. In the second half the Australian pack took control and the Wallabies scored three tries through Ryan, Tony Shaw and Weatherstone, one of which was converted by McLean. Rothmans Yearbook singled out Loane who \"stood out in the Wallaby pack\" and Hauser who \"had an excellent game at scrum-half\".\nUnited States.\nIn the first game ever played by a United States national rugby union team in their own country, Australia won 24–12 but needed two late tries to make the game safe. In a game played in 83-degree heat, Australia took a 13–6 lead at half-time through Ray Price's try and three penalty goals from Jim Hindmarsh, to Oxman's two penalty goals for the home team. Hindmarsh stretched the lead to 16–6 with another penalty goal before two from Oxman brought the United States back within four points with eight minutes left. Tries from Ryan and Pearse ultimately gave the Wallabies a comfortable win although Rothmans Yearbook stated that \"the losers fought back right to the end\" and \"were by no means outclassed\".\nOther matches.\nBarbarians.\nBarbarians: Andy Irvine, Gerald Davies, Ray Gravell, Mike Gibson, J. J. Williams, Phil Bennett, Gareth Edwards, Mike Knill, Peter Wheeler, Sandy Carmichael, Allan Martin, Gordon Brown, Trefor Evans, Mervyn Davies (c), Fergus Slattery\nTouring party.\nSquad.\nTest and tour appearances include appearances as a replacement, which are shown in brackets e.g. (1R)"

        "title": "1912 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 1912 Giro d'Italia was the fourth edition of the Giro d'Italia, a Grand Tour set up and sponsored by the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race began on 19 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Padua. The race was composed of nine stages that covered a total distance of . The race came to a close in Bergamo on 4 June after a stage. The race was won by the Atala-Dunlop team that finished with Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Micheletto. Second and third respectively were Peugeot and Gerbi.\nThe calculation of the general classification changed from the previous editions of the race, shifting to a team-based event, with each team only allowed four riders. Points were awarded to teams based upon winning the stage, having multiple riders in the top four places in each stage, and finishing the stage with a minimum of three riders. A total of fourteen teams participated, with 56 riders registering and 54 officially starting the race.\nMicheletto won the opening stage of the race to give Atala-Dunlop the first lead in the race. Despite two consecutive stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers to overflow on the course and riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; this led to the cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg that drew some of its route from the Giro di Lombardia. An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.\nChanges from the 1911 Giro d'Italia.\nOutside the yearly changes in the route, race length, and number of stages, the biggest change was in how the general classification was to be calculated. The organizers chose to make the general classification centered on teams rather than individuals as the race was contested in the first three years of its existence. They chose to only allow teams of four riders to compete in the race, making this the first Giro d'Italia to not contain any independent riders. Each team was required to have three riders finish each stage in order to remain in the race. The general classification was still determined by a point system: four points went to the team that the stage winner came from, if a team got two riders in the top four placings on a stage they got two points, and if a team completed the stage with the minimum three riders, they earned one point.\nThe new point system for the general classification was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A \"La Stampa\" writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system would be.\nThe team that won general classification won a grand prize of 4000 lire. The runner-up of the race received 2000 lire, third was rewarded with 1000 lire, fourth got 600 lire, and fifth place received 400 lire. Each stage winner received 600 lire and second place on the day got 300 lire.\nParticipants.\nOf the 56 riders that signed up to participate in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and so all the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry. Each team was required to wear identical colored jerseys.\nThe fourteen teams that took part in the race were:\nAtala-Dunlop was the favorite going into the race as the team was composed of 1909 winner Luigi Ganna, two-time winner Carlo Galetti, Giovanni Micheletto, and Eberardo Pavesi. The team was collectively known as \"The Four Musketeers.\" The Gerbi team contained last year's third-place finisher Giovanni Gerbi, last year's runner-up and stage winner Giovanni Rossignoli, and former stage winner Pierino Albini. Legnano, Bianchi and Peugeot were also seen as contenders for the overall victory. The race also featured future Giro d'Italia winner Carlo Oriani who competed for the Stucchi team.\nRace overview.\nThe race was planned to begin at 2:30 AM local time by the organizers, but due to large crowds and some participants arriving late, the race officially started at 2:43. The riders formed three groups on the road, of which the first one contained twenty riders when it passed through the checkpoint in Brescia. The group further thinned to sixteen by the time it reached Verona, and to eleven when it arrived at the checkpoint in Vicenza. From the group, the sprint to the finish line was mainly contested by Giovanni Micheletto and Giuseppe Santhià, of which the former managed to win the leg. With Atala-Dunlop's Micheletto winning the stage and his teammate Carlo Galetti finishing third, Atala-Dunlop acquired seven points and the lead in the race.\nThe second stage of the race saw a large group of around forty riders enter Mantua after over one hundred kilometers of racing. After the group broke into five or six smaller groups due to a large crash and in part due issues brought about by heavy fog. A group of seven was first to reach the stage's finish in Bologna, where Bianchi's Vincenzo Borgarello won the sprint to the line. Stage 3 began under heavy cloud coverage. The leading group on the road was reduced as the stage traversed the hillier portions of the stage. Ernesto Azzini of the Legnano team won the stage after edging out Eberardo Pavesi.\nThe race's fourth stage saw very rainy conditions throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the wrong turn onto Sabina rode for over , once they had reached Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined with the weather and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome for the start of the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di Lombardia, despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.\nAtala-Dunlop's Luigi Ganna abandoned the race during the fifth stage due to injuries suffered from a crash during the fourth stage before it was cancelled. Galetti won the fifth leg, but with the placings on the stage, Peugeot took the race lead from Atala-Dunlop. Rain marred the start of the sixth stage at 6:40 local time, as well as most of the stage itself. A group of sixteen riders formed at the front of the race and was later reduced to ten before passing through Lucca. Lauro Bordin of the Gerbi team attacked and went on to ride solo, reaching the checkpoint in Spezia fifteen minutes quicker than Azzini, Cocchi, and Agostoni. Bordin reached the finish first, eighteen minutes ahead of the second-place finisher.\nBorgarello won his second stage with his victory in the seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on to the track in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before the start of the final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi convinced him to continue the race and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were five teams who had completed all nine stages with the required number of riders. For these teams, the points they received from each of their stage placing's were added up for the general classification. The team with the most accumulated points was the winner.\nAftermath.\nThe race organizers, \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" recognized the team point system was not a success and reverted to the individual point based system for the general classification for the 1913 edition. Despite the failure of the team system, the newspaper still achieved success with the race, causing them to shift to a daily newspaper rather than three times a week. If the race had been contested based upon the time it took to complete each stage and their respective sum for each rider, the race would have been won by Carlo Galetti."

The race began on 6 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Genoa, finishing back in Milan on 22 May after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by the Italian rider Carlo Oriani of the Maino team. Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Eberardo Pavesi and Giuseppe Azzini.\nIt was the last Giro with a final classification in points and the first one in which the final winner of the race did not win a single stage. The Giro saw the debut of the twenty-year-old Costante Girardengo, who won the 6th stage. The 1913 Giro was the last concluded by Luigi Ganna, winner of the first edition.\nChanges from the 1912 Giro d'Italia.\nOutside the yearly changes in the route, race length, and number of stages, the biggest change to how the general classification was to be calculated. The race organizers decided to change back to the way the general classification had been calculated in the earlier editions, by the individual and the awarding of points based on how high the rider placed in each stage rather than doing a team points based system like the previous edition.\nParticipants.\nOf the 99 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 6 May, 35 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 22 May. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were eight teams that competed in the race: Ganna-Dunlop, Gerbi-Dunlop, Globo-Dunlop, Legnano-Dunlop, Maino-Pirelli, Otav-Pirelli, Peugeot Italy-Tedeschi, and Stucchi-Dunlop.\nThe peloton was composed completely of Italians. The field featured three former Giro d'Italia champions in the 1909 winner Luigi Ganna, three-time winner and returning champion Carlo Galetti, and returning champion Eberardo Pavesi. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Giovanni Rossignoli, Alfredo Sivocci, Carlo Oriani, and Giuseppe Azzini.\nAmong the riders was Edoardo Bardelli, who had recently turned seventeen. Bardelli is the youngest rider to have started the Giro d'Italia.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 35 cyclists who had completed all nine stages. For these cyclists, the points they received from each of their stage placing's were added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated points was the winner.\nIsolati rider classification.\nThere was a classification for only the \"isolati\" riders that was called the \"Premio Momo,\" it was calculated in the same manner as the general classification.\nTeam classification.\nTo be eligible for the team classification, known in Italian as the \"Premio dell'Industria\", the team must have three riders complete the course.&gt; For each team that had at least the necessary three riders complete the race, the three riders with the lowest point totals from the team would be added together to give each team its score. The team with the lowest total of points was the winner of the classification.\nAftermath.\nUpon winning the race, Carlo Oriani enlisted in the Corps of the Bersaglieri, the Italian infantry, and got commissioned into World War I. Oriani died in a military hospital in Casserta.\nReferences.\nBibliography.\n--External links=="

It was further intensified by the expatriate population who worked with local people to develop rugby. In 2008, National University of Lesotho organized a team known as NUL Spears Rugby Club. The club only participated in Intervarsity held between universities of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.\nRugby is centred on the national capital, and only sizable city, Maseru. Lesotho's poverty and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to maintain a proper national league structure.\nThe country is surrounded on all sides by South Africa. Rugby union in South Africa is a major sport - the country has both hosted and won the Rugby World Cup - and Lesotho is saturated by South African media of various types. Lesotho can therefore be considered one of several countries within South African rugby's sphere of influence - including Namibia, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Botswana.\nMaseru Kings.\nIn late 2011 the Maseru Kings Rugby Club was established in the capital. The team joined and began competing in the Eastern Free State leagues in South Africa in May 2012. As the only team regularly playing in Lesotho the Maseru Kings have become the de facto national team."

        "title": "Indoor golf",
        "text": "Indoor golf is an umbrella term for all activities in golf which can be carried out indoors. Venues include indoor driving ranges, chipping areas, putting greens, machines and home golf simulators. Many of these indoor facilities are businesses that include additional entertainment options as well as food and drink for customers.\nA golf simulator allows golf to be played on a graphically or photographically simulated driving range or golf course, usually in an indoor setting. In some cases, based on the location of the sensing devices, it is now possible to capture data on both ball and club for most accurate speed and directional information, and simulated ball flight behavior. \nThe data about a golfers swing that is collected during a golf shot is extrapolated to provide ball flight trajectory and roll out according to certain calculated relationships to the ball's flight performance per the tracked motion of the ball or club, adding environmental aspects through which the ball is projected, including terrain, wind, rain and other such influences or obstacles. Also noted on specific height and width of the screen on the net.\nGolf simulator.\nA golf simulator allows golf to be played on a graphically or photographically simulated driving range or golf course, usually in an indoor setting. It is a technical system used by some golfers to continue their sport regardless of weather and time of day in a converted premises. Simulators have been available since the early 1970s, and systems range in cost from compact units costing well under $200 that work with a computer or video game console, to sophisticated ones costing tens of thousands of dollars. Advanced systems may utilize a dedicated room, hitting screen, projector and other paraphernalia.\nSimpler simulators typically do not possess built-in software, but measure the movement of the hand-held sensor and feeds the information to the video game. The information received is then translated into an action of some sort, usually hitting the ball. More advanced simulators often come with their own software, allowing the user to use the system as if they were on a driving range. Relying on a battery of environmental sensors, the software tracks each shot and represents the entire shot, from impact to how the ball bounces visually on screen. In this way, the golfer has a detailed analysis of the entire flight of the ball which can be used for practice or training.\nIt utilizes a projected landscape, sometimes with natural images. A computer calculates the expected trajectory of the golf ball from data gathered on the swing, and the image of the golf ball flight is then simulated on the screen via a projector. Golf simulators need to present club speed, club path, club face angle at impact, ball speed, ball path, horizontal and vertical launch angle and spin. There are several types of measurement system used in golf simulation to achieve this, such as simulator mats, sonic sound systems, optical sensor arrays, radar and camera ball tracking systems.\nSimulator mats.\nMany golf simulator systems use a sensor mat, which is essentially a rectangular mat containing several infrared sensors and microchips that can monitor the speed of the club as it passes the back sensor, the angle of the club and club speed as the ball and club pass the second sensor following impact and the direction of the ball as the club passes the third sensor. Such systems are used by GolfBlaster3D, ProTee United, Dancin' Dogg by Optishot, TruGolf and Unex Golf.\nSonic sound systems.\nA sonic system uses strategically placed microphones around the impact screen. The system measures and compares the intensity of sound that is produced by the ball hitting the screen. Using 3 or more directional microphones and an interface that can measure the sound amplitude of the impact from each microphone, an XY impact position can be determined. This type of measurement system is rarely used in modern simulators.\nRadar systems.\nA radar sits aside the player to gather launch data. They emit a microwave that reflects off any moving object which returns to the sensor. The system can then record trajectory, launch angle, speed and direction. Additional physics is applied to these figures to calculate spin, axis and tilt. These types of system can be used indoors or outdoors. They are very useful as launch monitors, and they work very effectively. Several professionals make use of them to analyse their game in real environments. Typical examples are available from TrackMan and Flightscope.\nOptical sensor systems.\nThis method uses two banks of Infra Red sensors that scan across the bay in both X and Y directions. The ball passes through the first set of sensors and its XY coordinate is captured. The ball then passes another set of sensors and the second XY coordinates are captured again. The two co-ordinates are then compared to determine the vertical launch angle, ball path and speed. The system is very accurate, but very expensive to construct, as you need hundreds of optical sensors and emitters to catch the coordinates of the ball in both sensor positions. The main disadvantage is that the ball must always pass through both sensors with a fast shot so that there is no downward curve in the ball's trajectory before hitting the screen. That means that chipping and putting will not work too well.\nCamera Systems.\nCameras are becoming the norm in golf simulation. In general, one, two, three or four cameras are used that continuously monitor the play area. The downward swing path, impact, club face angle, launch angle and ball speed are all captured by the high speed cameras, normally running at around 100 to 120 frames per second. Camera data is processed using complex physics algorithms to produce a multitude of data such as back spin, side spin, trajectory, club face angle, swing path, loft, distance, carry and roll. \nThe, most common types of camera measurement system are Triggered and Continuous. With triggered systems, Images are taken only after the club has passed through a trigger point to activate the camera. With continuous systems, the camera records permanently, and data is processed once impact with the ball is observed. Continuous cameras must be capable of frame rates in excess of 100 frames per second per camera. Such systems are used by Bogolf, Visual Sports, Sports Coach Systems and Full Swing Golf. For both methods, one camera is floor mounted facing the ball trajectory from the side, the other is over head mounted and facing down. ProTee United is using a high speed sensor system to read club head information, special floor sensors for putting and two high speed cameras (one on the floor and one on the ceiling) to pick up ball flight information. An alternative method of measuring these two angles is to mount both cameras in the upper left and right corners of the bay. This is known as stereoscopic image processing.\nDimensions.\nThe typical dimensions of a golf simulator are approximately wide × in length and just over in height. This allows freedom of movement whilst swinging. This space typically allows for both left- and right-handed players with backswings and follow throughs.\nAdvantages.\nThe principal advantage of a golf simulator is the ability to conveniently play and practice in a controlled ambience. Often this means the ability to play without any pressure, green fees, or tee times; however, the advent of \"indoor golf centers\", which provide simulators for commercial play, bring many of these competitive and social aspects into the simulated game. For those who live in wintry climes or urban settings, golf simulators offer the ability to play and practice year-round or within the confines of their locale. The space requirements can range from just needing an ceiling to an entire wall upon which the game's screen is attached. The next important advantage is the player's ability to see each facet of their swing. Many golf simulators measure: angle of attack, angle of the club face, club head speed, spin, club path (inside out or outside in), and more. These measurements help both students and teaching professionals identify exactly what a player needs to know to improve their swing.\nMechanics.\nThere are a number of different technologies in use presently. Principally they either track ball flight or club head motion. Ball flight is typically tracked via wavelength (infrared), audio, and/or laser sensors. These instruments serve as a means by which the ball's flight properties are tracked, namely launch angle, ball speed and ball direction. Club motion is similarly tracked via wavelength sensors or other devices such tethers, cameras, or lasers, which record the speed and direction of the club's head as well as the impact point of the ball on the club's striking surface. In some cases, based on the location of the sensing devices, it is now possible to capture data on both ball and club for most accurate speed and directional information, and simulated ball flight behavior.\nThe data collected is extrapolated to provide ball flight trajectory and roll out according to certain calculated relationships to the ball's flight performance per the tracked motion of the ball or club, adding environmental aspects through which the ball is projected, including terrain, wind, rain and other such influences or obstacles.\nThe way that the information is tracked varies as much as having a wall-sized screen recording ball speed and placement upon impact, to sensors that record the moments before, during and after the impact between the ball and club, in which case, the ball is held by a tether.\nAccuracy.\nA key attribute of any simulator is accuracy. Ball flight is the primary determinant of a system's accuracy. Speed of the calculations and a predictable projected image of the ball in flight is one measurement of a system's accuracy. Predictability or the plausibility of prediction is a measure according to known ball flight properties among golf experts.\nA ball's flight depends upon many things, including the ball itself, the strike and impact of the club upon the ball, the ball's launch angle, direction, spin rate and velocity, as well as the hitting surface from which the ball is struck and the simulated environment through which the ball virtually flies, suggesting wind, rain, and other environmental aspects that may affect ball flight. The battle for superiority in this market exists between the technologies utilized to track ball flight or club motion.\nTraining facilities.\nIndoor driving range.\nAn indoor driving range can be a low-ceiling structure in which players hit golfballs into a net at close range, or a large high-ceiling dome, where players are better able to observe the trajectory of the golfball in flight. Because of the nature of being indoors, these structures provide players with the opportunity to practice regardless of the outside conditions. Teaching professionals and computer/video evaluation tools may also be available at these ranges, as well as specialized areas for putting, chipping, and sand shots.\nPlaces.\nIndoor golf can be found in different areas. Everywhere where there is enough space in order to swing the club, a training area or a golf simulator to be installed.\nCommercial Applications:\nCountry clubs, hotels and resorts, offices, fitness facilities and sports bars are among the many commercial uses of golf simulators. These serve both as entertainment for guests and practice for golfers. An indoor golf center consists of several simulators and a golf practice area, often including indoor driving range, chipping area, putting green, or any combination.\nResidential Applications:\nIndoor golf simulators have been gaining popularity in residential applications during recent years. As technology advances bring costs down, many avid golfers have chosen to equip their homes with indoor golf training facilities.\nIndoor golf greens have recently enjoyed a drastic increase in overall quality and play-ability while also enjoying a significant reduction in cost."

In 1984 the Shaughnessy Golf &amp; Country Club was also the subject of a dispute, Guerin v. The Queen between the Crown and the Musqueam Nation; the case ended up in the Supreme Court of Canada and established the government had a fiduciary duty to the First Nations of Canada. \nHistory.\nThe Shaughnessy Heights Golf Course, today the Shaughnessy Golf and Country Club, had its beginning in 1911 in the office of CPR executive Richard Marpole. Nine businessmen, all residents of the prestigious and quickly developing enclave of Shaughnessy, to turn of land leased from the CPR into the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Course. The first nine holes opened on November 2, 1912; the second nine, the next year. The course was designed by A.V. Macan, an Irish immigrant from Wexford, who was one of the region's best golfers.\nIn the decades to follow, many of the names who played a prominent role in Vancouver's growth and prosperity also appeared on Shaughnessy's membership roster.\nThe club moved to new premises in the late 1950s, responding to the growth of the Vancouver urban region, and sold its original property. Macan, then in his late 70s, also designed the new course, which opened in the early 1960s. The land the club currently resides upon belongs to the Musqueam Nation but was leased to Shaughnessy through a series of meetings with federal agents that did not include the Nation. The land will not be returned to the Musqueam until 2033.\nIn 2011 the club hosted the Canadian Open for the fourth time, which coincides with Shaughnessy's 100th anniversary. It follows the 2011 British Open, which was held at Royal St George's Golf Club.\nIn 2023, the club will host the Canadian Women's Open for the first time."

        "text": "The 1960 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Grand National Series stock car race that was held on February 14, 1960, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. It was the 5th race of the 1960 season, and was won by Junior Johnson in a 1959 Chevrolet.\nSummary.\nThe 200 lap race started with Cotton Owens on the pole and Jack Smith joining him on the front row. Junior Johnson won the four hour race driving a 59 Chevy owned by John Masoni. A crowd of 38,775 watched as Johnson drove the number 27 to victory after starting in the 9th position.\nBud Burdick, Pappy Crane, Dick Foley, Dick Freeman, Tommy Herbert, Dave Hirschfield, Bob Kosiski, Shep Langdon and Bill Lutz would retire from NASCAR after this event.\nPre-race.\nIn late January 1960, the CBS network sent anchorman Bud Palmer and 50 other employees to Daytona to cover the events in the first-ever televised coverage of a NASCAR event. CBS announced that their \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" show would televise a couple compact car races and the Grand National Pole Position races at Daytona on January 31. On February 13 a Modified-Sportsman race took place. NASCAR officials lined up 73 cars to take the green flag. Less than a minute and a half after the green flag flew, mayhem ensued when Dick Foley's Chevy got out of shape. While Foley was able to gather control of his car, and finish the race in tenth place, 37 other vehicles behind him crashed while attempting to avoid the confusion. Twelve cars flipped, and a total of 24 drivers were unable to continue the race. Five ambulances responded to transport 8 drivers to local hospitals. Four drivers were released that day, and four drivers were held overnight. Notable drivers Ralph Earnhardt, Wendell Scott, and Speedy Thompson were among those forced out of the race. Driver Speedy Thompson was quoted as saying It took cleaning crews and tow trucks only 39 minutes to clear the track for the restart. Marion \"Bubba\" Farr went on to win the record setting crash fest. He drove a 1956 Ford modified with a 1958 Lincoln engine and 6 carburetors, and finished with an average speed of .\nQualifying races.\nFireball Roberts won the first qualifying race, and Jack Smith won the second on the track. Roberts grabbed his victory on the paved oval completing the 40 laps in 45 minutes, with two cautions in a 1960 Pontiac. Roberts started second beside Cotton Owens who won the pole with a speed of . Owens finished second, and Fred Lorenzen rounded out the top 3 with 2 cautions for 5 laps. The first caution came on lap 1 when Gene White, Dave Hirschfield, and Tommy Irwin all got together coming out of turn two. Irwin and his Ford Thunderbird took a trip into lake Lloyd located in the infield, and Irwin had to swim to safety as the car was nearly submerged. By the time the yellow flag had been displayed, Roberts had already advanced to the front of the pack, and would never relinquish the lead. The win would give Roberts his 22nd NASCAR victory. \nSmith and his 1960 Pontiac captured the victory from the pole with a qualifying speed of , and completed the second race in just over 40 minutes with an average speed of . There were 2 cautions; and Bobby Johns finished second with Jim Reed grabbing the third spot. The first single lap caution came when John Rostek spun on lap six, and the second caution, also a one lap slow down, came when Johnny Dodd Jr. crashed into the wall on lap 15. The dubious distinction of bringing out the first ever black flag fell to Herman \"Turtle\" Beam on lap 8 when officials noticed that Beam was running without his safety helmet, which he had forgotten on the starting grid. Smith set a record for the time by winning with the combination of his speed, and the minimal caution laps. The win was Smith's second of the year, and 12,500 people looked on as he and Roberts grabbed the two top spots in the qualifying races.\nRace.\nRace day was a brisk day with a high of , with steady winds at , strong gusts, and no rain. The high winds, combined with the high speeds resulted in 32 laps being run under caution, and multiple crashes. Tommy Herbert suffered a broken arm and severe eye injury when his T-bird flipped and blew apart when he crashed into the wall on the back straightaway on lap 118. The engine went one direction, the car another, and the front end assembly took flight up to 75 feet in the air. Driving through the wreckage, Pappy Crane spun, then rolled his Chevy, but was not hurt. Also included in the attrition was George Green whose car burst into flame forcing him to leap from the car to safety, and Tom Pistone who lost control with 2 laps remaining and hit the turn 4 wall. \nJunior Johnson took the lead with nine laps remaining when Bobby Johns spun, and Johnson went on to win the race. Johns had grabbed the lead on lap 172, but the winds pulled his back window out, and he lost control. The win was Johnson's first victory of the season.\nThe 1960 race is remembered as being the slowest Daytona 500 race in history, as Johnson averaged just over the .\nLegacy.\nThere were so many cars destroyed or damaged during the 500 that NASCAR officials felt compelled to cancel a couple races that were scheduled for the following weekend. Palmetto Speedway and Hollywood Speedway both lost their scheduled events due to the carnage at Daytona.\nRace winner Junior Johnson went on to achieve multiple accolades in the following years; including being inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990 and being selected as one of NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998. On February 4, 2010, NASCAR announced that Johnson would be Grand Marshal for the 50th anniversary of his 1960 victory.\nPart of Johnson's duties as Grand Marshal would be to utter the immortal words \"Gentleman, start your engines\" at the 52nd running of the Daytona 500 on February 14, 2010.\nOfficial results.\nThe race lasted 4:00:30, with an average speed of ."

The world-leading 400 m hurdler L.J. van Zyl, veterans Danny McFarlane and Félix Sánchez, and the improving Isa Phillips and Javier Culson were also identified as possible medal contenders.\nIn the heats, Briton Dai Greene completed an unexpected and comfortable win, while seventeen-year-old Jehue Gordon of Trinidad and Tobago surprised with a senior national record to qualify for the semis. In the semi-finals, van Zyl failed to qualify, following his pattern of poor performances at the biggest races of the season. Dutch and Phillips also failed to make the cut. Clement and Sánchez lead the way in the first semi, while Jackson and Greene (who set a personal best) took the top two spots in the other final.\nIn the final, Clement, Jackson and Culson all started the race well. However, it was the favourite, Clement, who took the gold medal: he was ahead at the final straight and did not relinquish his position, recording a world-leading time to win. Culson set a Puerto Rican record to take the silver, while Jackson fended off a challenge from national-record-breaking Gordon to keep third and win the bronze.\nAlthough Clement's winning time was the second slowest in the history of the Championships, it remained a close race for the silver and bronze medals, with just 0.6 seconds between the silver medallist and seventh-placed Greene. The race had a breadth of ages, with Trinidadian Gordon becoming the youngest ever finalist of any men's sprint event at the Championships, and 37-year-old McFarlane being the oldest ever to do the same feat.

        "text": "The 1961 Daytona 500, was a NASCAR Grand National Series event that was held on February 26, 1961, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.\nMarvin Panch won the race in the one-year-old 1960 Pontiac built and owned by Smokey Yunick after taking the lead on lap 187. Panch was not originally scheduled to drive, and was only added to Yunick's team after Fireball Roberts suggested adding him. Panch drove the number 20 to victory in three hours and 20 minutes. The race was run in its entirety without a single caution flag. Panch took the lead with 13 laps remaining when race leader Fireball Roberts' car suffered a blown engine. The win was Panch's first, and only victory of the season.\nBackground.\nTragedy struck during the preliminaries of Daytona Speedweeks when a driver from Phoenix, Arizona crashed in turn 3 of the track. Harold Haberling was killed when his 1955 modified Chevy flipped in the 31-degree banking. This was the first fatality at the facility since 1959.\nOne week prior to the Daytona 500 drivers competed in a first-ever \"compact car\" race. Lee Petty won the race contested on the infield track in a 1960 Valiant with an average speed of . Joe Weatherly would flip his 1960 Falcon upside down during the race, but no other cars were involved in the accident, and Weatherly was not injured. Weatherly then went on to win a 10-lap, event dubbed a \"Race of Champions\" on the banked tri-oval. Drivers competed in the same cars that they would run in the Daytona 500. The race proved to be a tough loss for Fireball Roberts, who had started at the rear of the field but managed to charge to the lead in only 4 laps. On the last lap, Weatherly overtook Roberts at the finish line, winning by only 2 feet.\nA total of 70 drivers registered to run in the 1961 Daytona 500, but only the top 60 would be scheduled to start the race. A total of 13 teams came to Daytona with the new, more aerodynamically designed 1961 Pontiacs contributed by the manufacturer. Smokey Yunick brought Fireball Roberts as his primary driver for the new model vehicle, and it was Roberts who suggested that Yunick add teammate Marvin Panch. Panch was a 'last minute' addition to Yunick's team and given the year-old 1960 Pontiac rather than one of the newer models. When approached, Yunick relented to allowing Panch to drive Roberts' Pontiac Catalina from the previous year, saying: \"If you think that much about [the '60 Pontiac], take it outside.\" [the shop], where the mechanics prepared the car for the 500.\nDuring the initial 2-lap qualifying trials Fireball Roberts set a new track record of average speed over the run. The second fastest average belonged to Joe Weatherly in his 1961 Pontiac, with Cotton Owens, Curtis Turner, and Marvin Panch rounding out the top 5. Roberts broke the previous track record speed of set by Jack Smith the previous July. Roberts' effort was the first of three consecutive pole positions that he captured from 1961 through 1963. The 3 \"consecutive\" poles was a first, and a record which Roberts still shares with Bill Elliott (1985–87) and Ken Schrader (1988–90).\nTwin qualifying events.\nThe two qualifying events which established the starting lineup of the Daytona 500 were marred by multiple crashes in which at least one fan and seven drivers were injured on February 24, 1961. A total of 34 drivers were scheduled for the first of two qualifying events, and 33 cars scheduled for the second event. The top 20 finishers would secure positions in the upcoming event, with winners of each qualifier also earning a $5,000 purse. The top two time-trial qualifiers were also guaranteed the top two starting spots.\nAn accident early in the first event involved Dave Mader and Wes Morgan in which Morgan's car flipped seven times going into the 4th turn. Both Lee Petty and son Richard Petty crashed during their respective qualifying events, forcing Petty Enterprises into a noncompetitive role for the 1961 Daytona 500. Son Richard crashed through the guardrail and suffered a sprained ankle in the first qualifier, and while the car remained upright, the crash kept him from starting the 500. The wreck occurred when driver Junior Johnson got thrown out of control as debris from an earlier wreck caused a cut tire, and he made contact with the younger Petty's car. The crash left Johnson with a severe gash to his chin, and Petty with shards of glass in his eye. The younger Petty's crash brought out one of the five cautions in the first 40-lap qualifier, which was shortened due to crashes at both ends of the track during the closing laps.\nShortly after Richard Petty left the infield medical center after the first race crash, his attention was drawn to an accident involving his father in the second race. Patriarch Lee tangled with Johnny Beauchamp when Beauchamp caught Petty's back bumper sending the two cars through the guardrail which destroyed both vehicles. The accident started when Banjo Matthews spun in front of the field while leading the second qualifying race. The senior Petty suffered multiple life-threatening injuries, including numerous fractures, internal injuries, and a punctured lung. When the two cars left the track, Petty's car struck spectator A. B. Kelley, who suffered severe cuts, but helped evacuate Petty from the twisted metal. Beauchamp and Petty tore out 13 8-inch by 8-inch guardrail support posts while exiting the track. There's been speculation that the early crash between Mader and Morgan may have weakened that section. Some of the drivers felt that much of the blame for the multiple crashes lay in the fact that so many rookie drivers were not capable of running competently; and Joe Weatherly stated: “I know it was veteran drivers in the worst crashes, but it was rookies that caused them, dammit!” Petty was hospitalized for over four months, but did recover. While Beauchamp also suffered injuries to his head, they were less serious. Petty and Beauchamp were no strangers to each other; having been involved in the iconic finish of the inaugural 1959 Daytona 500 where they crossed the finish line so close to each other that it took NASCAR 3 days before Bill France Sr. declared Lee Petty the winner. Beauchamp never raced again after the accident; and while Petty did return to run a half-dozen races, the wreck effectively ended both driver's careers. Driver Rex White stated that: “If NASCAR doesn’t have a meeting to educate some of these amateurs, there can’t be much of a race on Sunday. There were some goofballs on the track today.”, and even Fireball Roberts, winner of the first race, stated that:\n Fireball Roberts and Joe Weatherly each won their respective qualifying events.\nQualifying race results\nRace Summary.\nPrior to the start of the main event, drivers were understandably apprehensive due to the large number of mishaps during the qualifying races. This prompted officials to hold a meeting explaining that rough driving would not be tolerated, and during the race, two cars were black-flagged for driving too slowly to be considered safe. A total of 51,287 fans arrived in Daytona to witness the race which was run at an average speed of . Unofficial estimates placed the total in attendance at over 65,000 people, with speculation of perhaps 100,000. Seventeen drivers in the starting field were designated rookies by NASCAR, and were identified by having their rear bumpers painted with 'Day-glo' paint. Smokey Yunick instructed Panch to not run too close to teammate Roberts so that if Roberts were caught up in any altercations on the track then both cars would not risk being taken out in the same incident.\nFireball Roberts started on the pole for the event, with Joe Weatherly on the outside front row. Roberts jumped out front and held the lead through lap 12 when Banjo Mathews took the point position. Roberts traded the lead position with Mathews, Junior Johnson, Nelson Stacy for the first 42 laps. At lap 43 Roberts took command of the race in dominating style; and continued to lead for the majority of the race, building a lead of 2 laps over the rest of the field. Although Richard Petty did not start the race, he did drive in relief for Bob Wellborn from lap 120 through 169, after which Wellborn resumed the driving duties. On lap 182 driver Darel Dieringer contacted the outside fence, but managed to make repairs in time to finish the race. There were a total of nine lead changes between five drivers, and the race was completed without a single caution. Roberts would come back and lead a total of 170 of the 200 laps, including 145 consecutive laps from the 45th to the 187th. Then on lap 187, with more than a two-lap lead on second place teammate Panch, Roberts' engine failed knocking him out of the race. Marvin Panch took his first lead of the race with only 13 laps remaining, and held on to reach the checkered flag first, 16 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Joe Weatherly's number 8, who completed the race on one set of tires. The caution-free event was one of only 3 times that the iconic race ran the entire distance under green; with 1959 and 1962 being the only other 2 times it's occurred.\nWhile Pontiac's factory heads had wanted a new year model to win the race, car owner Yunick was so pleased with Panch's performance that he upped his promised take of 40% to 50% of the winnings, saying: \"Tell you what. Anybody good enough to win the race is worth 50 percent to me.\" Panch completed the with only one change of tires, and in a then-record for a closed course race of any kind, completed the contest in 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 32 seconds. That time equated to an average speed of , which was more than faster the pole qualifier of the Indianapolis 500 that same year. Since Daytona did not have a designated \"Victory lane\" at the time, after the race Panch pulled his winning car into the infield grass, and celebrated the win with Bill France Sr., Yunick, and his family. The victory was Panch's first NASCAR win since the 1957 season, and the only victory of the 1961 season. Years after retiring from the sport, Panch would rebuild a replica of his winning Pontiac and tour the NASCAR circuit.\nReferences.\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography"

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2009 season began on January 9, 2010. The postseason tournament concluded with the New Orleans Saints defeating the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV, 31–17, on February 7, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.\nThe Wild Card round featured three games that were re-matches of Week 17 games.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games. Fox then televised the rest of the NFC games. CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games and Super Bowl XLIV.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 9, 2010.\nAFC: New York Jets 24, Cincinnati Bengals 14.\nRookie quarterback Mark Sanchez completed 12 of 15 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown while rookie running back Shonn Greene rushed for 135 yards as New York followed up their 37–0 win over the Bengals in the last week of the regular season with a 24–14 victory.\nBengals rookie Bernard Scott started off the game with a 56-yard kickoff return to the Jets 36-yard line. But two plays later, receiver Laveranues Coles lost a fumble while being tackled by Bryan Thomas. New York was forced to punt on their ensuing drive, and Rico Murray gave the Bengals good field position with a 23-yard return to the New York 45. This time Cincinnati was able to take advantage of their scoring opportunity, driving 45 yards in seven plays and finishing it with Carson Palmer's 11-yard touchdown pass to Coles.\nBut in the second quarter, the Jets began to take control of the game. First an 11-yard punt return by Jerricho Cotchery to the Bengals 47-yard line set up a touchdown on a 39-yard burst from Greene. Then New York defensive back Darrelle Revis intercepted a pass from Palmer and returned it 21 yards to the Jets 43-yard line. Two plays later, Sanchez converted a 3rd-and-12 with a 14-yard completion to Cotchery, and followed it up with a 41-yard scoring strike to tight end Dustin Keller.\nOn their first drive of the second half, Cincinnati drove from their own 12 to the Jets 17-yard line, featuring a 27-yard run by Cedric Benson. But they failed to score as Palmer's pass on third down was incomplete and Shayne Graham missed a 35-yard field goal attempt. Following the missed field goal, New York drove 75 yards in eight plays, with Sanchez completing an 18-yard pass to Cotchery and a 16-yarder to Braylon Edwards before Thomas Jones finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 21–7.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Benson took off for a 47-yard touchdown run to make it 21–14. But the Jets responded on their ensuing drive, with Sanchez's 43-yard completion to Keller setting up a 20-yard field goal by Jay Feely to put them back up by a two score margin. The Bengals managed one last attempt to get back in the game with a drive to the New York 11-yard line. But Graham missed another field goal, this one from 28 yards, with 3:43 left in regulation.\nBenson finished the game with a franchise record 169 rushing yards. The loss for the Bengals gave them their 19th consecutive season without a playoff win, the longest streak among all 32 NFL teams. Sanchez became only the fourth rookie quarterback to win his first playoff game, following Shaun King, Ben Roethlisberger and Joe Flacco.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Jets and Bengals, with New York winning the only prior meeting 44–17 in the 1982 AFC first round playoffs.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 34, Philadelphia Eagles 14.\nPlaying in the first playoff game in Cowboys Stadium, in front of a crowd of 92,951, the largest to attend an NFL postseason game other than the Super Bowl, Dallas racked up 426 yards and forced four turnovers en route to their first playoff win since 1996, while handing the Eagles their first one-and-done playoff run since that same year. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo threw for 244 yards and 2 touchdowns, while running back Felix Jones rushed for 148 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown run in the second half to put the game away.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, a 40-yard pass interference penalty on Eagles defensive back Sheldon Brown in the end zone set up Romo's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Phillips. Philadelphia quickly responded with a 76-yard touchdown pass from Michael Vick to Jeremy Maclin on the second play of their ensuing drive. But the Cowboys struck back with an 85-yard scoring drive, featuring 18-yard receptions by Jason Witten and Patrick Crayton, along with a key replay challenge that overturned an Eagles interception. Tashard Choice capped off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to give Dallas a 14–7 lead.\nPhiladelphia was forced to punt on their next drive, and Crayton returned the punt 31 yards to his own 41-yard line. On the next play, Romo's 36-yard completion to Miles Austin moved the ball to the Eagles 23, eventually leading to a Shaun Suisham field goal to make the score 17–7. Just 33 seconds later, the Cowboys increased their lead to 24–7 with Romo's 6-yard touchdown pass to Austin after linebacker Bobby Carpenter recovered a fumbled handoff from Vick on the Philadelphia 18-yard line. Then with time running out in the half, Cowboys linebacker Bradie James forced and recovered a fumble from fullback Leonard Weaver on the Eagles 42-yard line, setting up Suisham's second field goal to give Dallas a 27–7 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, Jones' 73-yard touchdown run capped off Dallas' scoring for the day. Meanwhile, the Cowboys defense held the Eagles in check the rest of the game, forcing two turnovers on downs, another fumble and an interception, while only allowing a meaningless touchdown on a 6 M-yard pass from Donovan McNabb to DeSean Jackson in the fourth quarter, making the final score 34–14.\nThis would be McNabb's final game in an Eagles uniform.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Eagles and Cowboys, with Dallas having won three of the four games, including the most recent 30–11 in the 1995 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 10, 2010.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 33, New England Patriots 14.\nThe Ravens converted three first-quarter turnovers by Patriots quarterback Tom Brady into 17 points on their way to a 24–0 lead New England could not recover from. It was the Patriots' first home loss of the season and their first home playoff loss in more than 30 years. On top of that, it was the Ravens' first win against the Patriots after five consecutive losses.\nBaltimore stormed to a 7–0 lead on the first play of the game with Ray Rice's 83-yard touchdown run, the second longest run in NFL playoff history. Then, linebacker Terrell Suggs forced and recovered a fumble from Brady on the Patriots 17-yard line, and they scored another touchdown with a 1-yard run by Le'Ron McClain. Following an exchange of punts, cornerback Chris Carr intercepted a pass from Brady and returned it to the New England 25-yard line, setting up a drive ending in Rice's second touchdown on a 1-yard run. Just two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Ravens safety Ed Reed intercepted a deep pass from Brady and returned it 25 yards before lateraling the ball to safety Dawan Landry, who took it another 25 yards to the Patriots 9-yard line. The Ravens could not gain any yards on their ensuing drive, but Billy Cundiff kicked a field goal to make the score 24–0.\nNew England was forced to punt on their next drive, but Baltimore returner Tom Zbikowski muffed the catch and Kyle Arrington recovered the ball for the Patriots at the Ravens 16-yard line. Five plays later, Brady threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman. Midway through the second half, Brady threw his third interception of the game, this one to Landry, who returned it 42 yards to the New England 22-yard line to set up another Cundiff field goal. Taking the ball back to the Patriots 47-yard line after Darius Butler's 42-yard kickoff return, New England responded with a 53-yard scoring drive. Brady finished it with his second touchdown pass to Edelman to cut their deficit to 27–14.\nZbikowski returned the ensuing kickoff 30 yards to his own 48-yard line, sparking a 52-yard drive that ended with a 3-yard touchdown run from Willis McGahee, making the score 33–14 after the two-point conversion failed. New England responded with a drive deep into Baltimore territory, but Stephen Gostkowski missed a 44-yard field goal attempt with 7:19 left in the game, ending any chance of a miracle comeback.\nRice rushed for 159 yards and two touchdowns, while McGahee added 62 yards and a score. Neither quarterback had much success, as Brady was held to 154 yards and intercepted three times, while Baltimore's Joe Flacco completed only 4 of 10 passes for 34 yards.\nThe Patriots would not be eliminated in the Wild Card Round again until 2019. In fact, they would not play in the Wild Card round again until that 2019 season.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Ravens and Patriots.\nNFC: Arizona Cardinals 51, Green Bay Packers 45 (OT).\nThis high scoring shootout set the NFL postseason record for most points (96), touchdowns (13) and first downs (62), while ranking third in total yards (1,024). But in the end, it was a defensive play that made the key difference when Cardinals linebacker Karlos Dansby returned a fumble 17 yards for a touchdown in overtime. This was only the second overtime game in NFL postseason history to be won by a defensive touchdown. The first one had been won by the Packers (vs. the Seattle Seahawks in 2003).\nArizona forced two early turnovers and built up a quick 17–0 lead. First, defensive back Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie's interception of an Aaron Rodgers pass set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Tim Hightower. Then Dansby forced a fumble from Packers receiver Donald Driver that defensive tackle Alan Branch recovered on the Green Bay 22-yard line, leading to Kurt Warner's 15-yard touchdown pass to Early Doucet. After a Green Bay punt, Warner led the Cardinals down the field, hitting Larry Fitzgerald for 14 yards, tight end Ben Patrick for 22, and Steve Breaston for 15 on the way to a 23-yard field goal from Neil Rackers.\nEarly in the second quarter, Packers cornerback Charles Woodson stripped the ball from Fitzgerald, and linebacker Clay Matthews returned the fumble 28 yards to the Green Bay 48. Aided by three Cardinals penalties, Green Bay drove 52 yards and scored on a 1-yard touchdown run from Rodgers. Arizona responded by driving 79 yards and scoring with Warner's second touchdown pass to Doucet. But Rodgers struck back with a pair of completions to tight end Jermichael Finley for gains of 44 and 17 yards on the way to a 20-yard field goal by Mason Crosby, cutting the score to 24–10 at halftime.\nThe second half opened up with five touchdowns on five consecutive drives. First, Warner threw his third touchdown pass of the day with a 33-yard strike to Fitzgerald. Rodgers responded with an 18-yard completion to Finley and a 35-yard strike to Greg Jennings before Jennings finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown catch. Then Green Bay surprised Arizona with an onside kick, which Brandon Underwood recovered on the Packers 43-yard line. Seven plays later, Rodgers threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson, cutting their deficit to 31–24. But a few plays after the ensuing kickoff, Beanie Wells' 42-yard run set up an 11-yard touchdown pass from Warner to Fitzgerald.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Rodgers again closed the gap to one score with a 30-yard touchdown pass to James Jones. Then after forcing a punt, Rodgers completed a 38-yard strike to Finley and a 28-yarder to Driver at the Cardinals 1-yard line. Fullback John Kuhn scored a 1-yard touchdown run on the next play to tie the game. But Arizona retook the lead with their next drive as Warner completed seven passes, the last one a 17-yard touchdown toss to Breaston. Taking the ball back at the 29-yard line with just under five minutes left in regulation, Rodgers hit Jones for six yards, scrambled for 13 yards, and then hit Jennings for 22 yards and a first down at the Arizona 25-yard line. A few plays later, he finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Spencer Havner, tying the game with less than two minutes to go. Arizona responded with a drive to the Green Bay 16-yard line, but Rackers missed a 34-yard field goal as time expired, sending the game into overtime.\nGreen Bay won the coin toss and got the ball first. But two plays into their drive, Cardinals defensive back Michael Adams sacked Rodgers as he was about to throw. The ball came out of Rodgers' hands, and a desperate Rodgers tried to kick the loose ball out of bounds, but it got away and went into the arms of Dansby, who returned the fumble 17 yards for a touchdown to win the game.\nIn his first career playoff game, Rodgers set a franchise record with 422 passing yards and four touchdowns. Warner completed 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards and a franchise record five touchdowns. He became the second player in NFL history to throw five touchdown passes in two different postseason games, joining Daryle Lamonica (Warner had thrown five touchdown passes in his first NFL playoff game a decade earlier). The Cardinals' 51 points was the most allowed by the Packers in their 41 postseason games. Arizona gained 531 total yards, with 156 rushing yards, against a Packers defense that finished the season ranked first in the NFL against the run and second fewest yards allowed overall.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Packers and Cardinals, with Green Bay winning the only prior meeting 41–16 over the then-St. Louis Cardinals in the 1982 NFC First Round playoffs.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 16, 2010.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 45, Arizona Cardinals 14.\nSaints running back Reggie Bush accumulated 217 all-purpose yards, including an 83-yard punt return touchdown, the third longest in NFL postseason history, and a franchise playoff record 46-yard touchdown run, while quarterback Drew Brees added 247 passing yards and three touchdowns. Although Arizona scored first, New Orleans racked up a franchise playoff record 35 points in the first half on the way to a 45–14 win on their way to their first NFC Championship Game appearance since 2006.\nArizona opened up a 7–0 lead just 19 seconds into the first quarter when Tim Hightower ran through a hole in the line, cut left and took off down the field for a 70-yard touchdown run on the game's first play from scrimmage. New Orleans struck back with a 72-yard drive on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynell Hamilton to tie the score. On the first play of the following drive, defensive back Randall Gay stripped the ball from Cardinals wide receiver Jerheme Urban, forcing a fumble that Saints safety Darren Sharper returned 13 yards to the Arizona 37-yard line. Three plays later, Brees converted the turnover into points with a 17-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey. Arizona was forced to punt on their next drive, and the Saints quickly scored again with a 46-yard touchdown run by Bush, increasing their lead to 21–7.\nJust over five minutes into the second quarter, Arizona cut the score to 21–14 with a 4-yard touchdown run by Beanie Wells. But New Orleans again responded quickly, as Brees completed a 26-yard pass to Marques Colston and followed it up with a 44-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson on a flea flicker play. Then Saints defensive lineman Will Smith intercepted a pass from Kurt Warner (who was injured on the play) and returned it five yards to the Cardinals 27, setting up Brees' 2-yard touchdown pass to Colston to give the Saints a 35–14 lead. The Cardinals, now led by Matt Leinart, responded with a drive to the Saints 33-yard line, but Neil Rackers missed a 50-yard field goal as time expired in the half. The combined 49 points scored by both teams in the first half was an NFL postseason record.\nIn the second half, the Saints added 10 more points to their lead with a Garrett Hartley field goal and Bush's 83-yard punt return touchdown. Meanwhile, Arizona only managed one drive inside Saints territory, which ended in a turnover on downs on the 10-yard line. With the win, the Saints returned to the NFC Championship Game for the second time in four years, and would become the first one to be held in the Superdome. This was the final game of Warner's Hall of Fame career.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Cardinals and Saints.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 20, Baltimore Ravens 3.\nIn the first playoff game in Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning completed 30 passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns, while the Colts defense limited Baltimore to a single field goal on their opening drive.\nIndianapolis kicker Matt Stover (a former Raven) opened up the scoring with a 44-yard field goal on the Colts' opening drive. Baltimore responded with a drive from their own 7 to the Colts 6-yard line where Billy Cundiff kicked a 25-yard field goal to tie the game.\nIn the second quarter, the Colts moved down the field on a 14-play, 75-yard drive that took eight minutes off the clock, their longest drive of the season. Manning finished the drive with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Austin Collie. After forcing a punt, the Colts got the ball back on their own 36-yard line, and they drove for another touchdown, moving the ball 64 yards in just 1:23 and scoring with Reggie Wayne's 3-yard touchdown catch as time expired in the half.\nMidway through the third quarter, Ravens safety Ed Reed intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it 38 yards. But receiver Pierre Garçon ripped the ball out of his hands during the return, and tight end Dallas Clark recovered it. Later on, Reed intercepted another pass and returned it 58 yards, but the play was nullified by a pass interference penalty on defensive back Corey Ivy, allowing the Colts to keep possession and drive for another Stover field goal, making the score 20–3.\nIndianapolis went on to seal the victory by forcing turnovers on the Ravens' next two drives. First Raheem Brock forced a fumble from Baltimore running back Ray Rice deep in Colts territory and linebacker Clint Session recovered it. Then following a punt, Colts defensive back Antoine Bethea picked off a pass from Joe Flacco on the Colts 2-yard line with less than five minutes left in the game.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Colts, with Indianapolis winning the only prior meeting 15–6 in the 2006 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSunday, January 17, 2010.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 34, Dallas Cowboys 3.\nThe Vikings defense dominated the Cowboys in the final playoff game in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, sacking quarterback Tony Romo six times, forcing him to fumble three times, and intercepting a pass, while Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre threw four touchdown passes, three to receiver Sidney Rice, who finished the game with 6 receptions for 141 yards.\nDallas started the game with two drives inside the Vikings 40-yard line, but didn't score on either one. First, Romo lost a fumble on the Vikings 35 while being tackled by Ray Edwards; it was recovered by the Vikings' Kevin Williams. Then after a punt, Dallas drove to the Vikings 30-yard line, only to have Shaun Suisham miss a 48-yard field goal. Four plays later, Minnesota took the lead with Favre throwing a 47-yard touchdown to Rice. Dallas responded with a drive from their own 18 to the Vikings 15-yard line where Suisham kicked a field goal to cut the score to 7–3. But the Vikings countered with another touchdown, with running back Adrian Peterson rushing for 18 yards and gaining 19 yards on a screen pass on the way to Favre's second touchdown throw to Rice, this one from 16 yards. Just two plays after the kickoff, Jared Allen sacked Romo, forcing a fumble that Minnesota's Ben Leber recovered on the Cowboys 20-yard line, leading to a Ryan Longwell field goal increasing the Vikings lead to 17–3 at the end of the first half.\nIn the second half, after another Dallas drive into Vikings territory that ended with a missed field goal attempt by Suisham, Leber intercepted a pass from Romo and returned it 10 yards to the Cowboys 15-yard line. Dallas kept the Vikings out of the end zone, but Longwell kicked another field goal to increase the lead to 20–3. Then, after a Dallas punt, Favre put the game away with a 45-yard touchdown completion to Rice with less than eight minutes left in the game. Later on, Dallas turned the ball over on downs on their own 37-yard line. Favre subsequently completed a 19-yard pass to Bernard Berrian before scoring the final points of the game on an 11-yard pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe.\nLeber finished with eight tackles, a fumble recovery and an interception, while Edwards recorded five tackles, a forced fumble and three sacks. This was the first time the 40-year-old Favre had thrown four touchdown passes in his 22 playoff games. With the win, the Vikings advanced to their first NFC Championship Game in nine years and first under Childress.\nThis was the seventh postseason meeting between the Cowboys and Vikings, with Dallas winning four of the prior six meetings. Minnesota won the most recent meeting 27–10 in the 1999 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAFC: New York Jets 17, San Diego Chargers 14.\nTrailing 7–0 at the end of the first half, New York scored 17 unanswered points and then sealed the victory with a fourth down conversion run from Thomas Jones with one minute left.\nEarly in the first quarter, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers moved the ball to the Jets 22-yard line with a 13-yard completion to Vincent Jackson and a 19-yarder to Malcom Floyd. But the drive stalled on the 18-yard line and ended with no points when Nate Kaeding missed a 36-yard field goal. Meanwhile, New York failed to gain a first down in the entire quarter.\nIn the second quarter, Rivers hit Jacob Hester for 15 yards and tight end Antonio Gates for 23 on the way to a 13-yard touchdown completion to Kris Wilson. Later on, San Diego running back Darren Sproles' 22-yard run moved the ball to the Jets 39-yard line with six seconds left. But Kaeding missed a 57-yard field goal attempt as time expired in the half.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Jets got on the board with a 46-yard field goal from Jay Feely. Midway through the third quarter, the Chargers got another scoring opportunity when Quentin Jammer picked off a pass from Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and returned it 24 yards to the New York 38-yard line. But three plays later, Rivers returned the favor when he threw a pass to Jackson that bounced off his body and into the arms of cornerback Darrelle Revis just before it hit the ground. The Jets were unable to convert the turnover into points, but Steve Weatherford's 54-yard punt pinned the Chargers back at their own 4-yard line. A few plays later, Rivers was intercepted again, this time by safety Jim Leonhard, who returned it 11 yards to the 16, setting up Sanchez's 2-yard touchdown pass to Dustin Keller. Then after forcing a punt, Jets running back Shonn Greene burst through the line, broke a tackle from Eric Weddle and took off for a 53-yard touchdown run, the longest in Jets postseason history, giving New York a 17–7 lead.\nSan Diego responded with a drive to the New York 22-yard line, but again came up empty when Kaeding missed his third field goal attempt of the day, this one with just 4:38 left in the game. After forcing a punt, Rivers completed a 37-yard pass to Jackson, a 19-yarder to Sproles and a 12-yard completion to Jackson at the 1-yard line before finishing the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. This cut the score to 17–14 with 2:14 left in the game. Following the ensuing onside kickoff (which was recovered by the Jets' Kerry Rhodes), New York faced a fourth down and 1 with 1:03 left. Rather than punting, coach Rex Ryan decided to go for the first down. Jones' 2-yard run sealed the victory, enabling New York to run out the rest of the clock.\nWith the win, the Jets advanced to their first AFC Championship Game since 1998. They also won consecutive playoff games for the first time since 1982. Sanchez joined Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco as the only rookie quarterbacks in NFL history to win two playoff games. The Chargers have not won the AFC West since 2009 and relocated to Los Angeles after the 2016 season. As a result, this was the last playoff game the Chargers played in San Diego.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Jets and Chargers. New York won the only prior meeting 20–17 in overtime in the 2004 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 24, 2010.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 30, New York Jets 17.\nThis game was the first time in NFL history that two first-year head coaches met in any conference championship game. The Colts defeated the Jets for the first time in the postseason and advanced to their second Super Bowl in the last four seasons. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning threw for 377 yards and three touchdowns as his team recovered from an 11-point deficit by scoring 24 unanswered points.\nAfter forcing Indianapolis to punt on their opening drive, New York drove from their own 29 to the Colts 22-yard line. But the Colts defense tightened up, tackling running back Shonn Greene twice behind the line of scrimmage and Brad Smith for a 1-yard gain, and then Jay Feely was wide right on a 44-yard field goal attempt.\nIn the second quarter, the Colts put together the first scoring drive of the game, with Manning completing two passes to Pierre Garçon for gains of 27 and 36 yards on the way to a 25-yard Matt Stover field goal. New York answered on the first play of their next drive with the longest play in the Jets' postseason history, as Mark Sanchez threw a pass to Braylon Edwards, who took off past Jacob Lacey and caught the ball without breaking stride for an 80-yard touchdown completion.\nManning led the Colts back on their next drive, completing a 25-yard pass to Reggie Wayne and a 22-yarder to Austin Collie at the Jets 4-yard line. But Indianapolis could not get into the end zone. Following an incomplete pass, Collie was tackled at the 1-yard line and then Manning was stuffed for no gain on a quarterback sneak, forcing them to settle for a second field goal from Stover to cut the score to 7–6. But New York struck back again. After three carries by Greene for 17 yards, Smith's 45-yard completion to Jerricho Cotchery from the Wildcat formation moved the ball to the Colts 12-yard line, setting up Sanchez's 9-yard touchdown pass to Dustin Keller with 4:53 left in the half. Three plays after the ensuing kickoff, Jets lineman Calvin Pace stormed through the line and tackled Joseph Addai as soon as he took a handoff, resulting in a fumble that safety Jim Leonhard recovered and returned to the Indianapolis 29-yard line. New York was unable to gain a first down with their drive, but Feely kicked a 48-yard field goal to increase their lead to 17–6.\nHowever, the Colts stormed back with 24 unanswered points. Manning responded to the field goal with three completions to Collie for 80 yards, the last one a 16-yard touchdown pass to cut the score to 17–13 at the end of the half. Then after a missed 52-yard field goal on New York's opening drive of the third quarter, Manning completed 6 of 7 passes for 57 yards on the way to his second touchdown pass, this one a 4-yarder to Garçon. Manning added his third touchdown pass, a 15-yard strike to Dallas Clark, six minutes into the fourth quarter. Then after a punt, a 16-yard run by Addai and a 23-yard catch from Garçon set up Stover's third field goal to make the score 30–17. Finally, Indianapolis sealed the game when Kelvin Hayden picked off a pass from Sanchez with just over two minutes remaining.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Jets and Colts, with New York winning both meetings, including 41–0 in the 2002 AFC Wild Card playoffs. They also met in Super Bowl III as the NFL champion Baltimore Colts and AFL champion New York Jets, with the Jets winning 16-7.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 31, Minnesota Vikings 28 (OT).\nFor the second time in three seasons, the NFC Championship Game required overtime to decide a winner. As in that game and the two other overtime games in the history of the conference championship games, the winning score was a field goal, this one from Saints kicker Garrett Hartley. The Vikings outgained New Orleans in total yards 475 to 257, and overcame five turnovers (three fumbles and two interceptions) to send the game to overtime. For the second time in 11 seasons, the Vikings were defeated by a field goal in a conference championship game, as they had lost by the same differential to the Atlanta Falcons in the 1998 NFC Championship Game. This would turn out to be Brett Favre's final playoff game.\nThe Vikings scored on the opening drive of the game as Adrian Peterson ran it into the end zone from 19 yards out. The Saints responded on the next drive, when Drew Brees threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to halfback Pierre Thomas that tied the game. Aided by three Saints penalties, the Vikings scored on their subsequent drive as Favre threw a touchdown pass to Sidney Rice and took a 14–7 lead.\nNew Orleans tied the game on their first drive of the second quarter with Brees' 9-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson. Later on, the Vikings got a scoring opportunity when New Orleans running back Reggie Bush muffed a punt that Minnesota's Kenny Onatolu recovered on the Saints 10-yard line. But two plays after that, the Vikings lost the ball themselves on a fumbled handoff from Favre to Peterson that was recovered by linebacker Scott Fujita with less than a minute left in the half.\nThe Saints' started the second half with a scoring drive that only took 2:04, set up by a 61-yard kickoff return from Courtney Roby. Thomas scored his second touchdown of the game on a 9-yard run and gave New Orleans their first lead of the game. Favre responded by leading the Vikings right back down the field, completing three passes to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe for 67 yards on an 80-yard drive that ended with Peterson scoring for the second time on a 1-yard touchdown run. After a Saints punt, Minnesota drove to the New Orleans 33-yard line, where Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma ended the drive by intercepting a pass intended for Rice. The Vikings defense managed to force another punt, but once again they turned the ball over as Saints defensive lineman Will Smith forced a fumble from Percy Harvin that Remi Ayodele recovered and returned to the Vikings 7-yard line.\nFollowing the turnover, New Orleans regained the lead early in the fourth quarter, as Brees threw his third touchdown pass of the game, this one a 5-yard toss to Bush, which was initially ruled down at the 1-yard line but changed to a touchdown after a Saints replay challenge. The Vikings responded with a drive inside the Saints 20-yard line, featuring a 27-yard run by Peterson and a 30-yard reception by Bernard Berrian, but once again the Saints defense forced a turnover, this time on a fumble by Berrian that was knocked free by defensive back Tracy Porter and recovered by Vilma. However, the Vikings defense quickly forced a punt, getting the ball back for the offense with great field position at the Minnesota 43-yard line. After a 16-yard reception by Shiancoe and an 18-yard run by Peterson, an 18-yard pass interference penalty on Porter moved the ball to the Saints 1-yard line. Peterson scored his third touchdown on the next play, tying the score with just over eight minutes left in the game.\nAfter forcing a punt, the Vikings got the ball back with 2:42 left and drove to the Saints 33-yard line, within range of a potential game-winning field goal by kicker Ryan Longwell. However, on the next two plays, Peterson and running back Chester Taylor were both tackled for no gain. Then, after calling a timeout with 19 seconds left, Minnesota was flagged for having 12 men in the huddle and penalized five yards, bringing up third down and 15 from the 38. On the next play, the Vikings decided to pass in an attempt to move the ball into better field goal range, but Porter intercepted a desperate throw from Favre, ending the drive and sending the game into overtime.\nThe Saints won the coin toss in overtime and never gave up the ball. Thomas returned Longwell's kickoff 40 yards to the New Orleans 39, and the team gained 39 additional yards on 10 plays, including a fourth down conversion leap attempt by Thomas. The Saints were aided by a defensive holding penalty by cornerback Asher Allen and a pass interference penalty called against linebacker Ben Leber. Brees threw to Robert Meachem at the 23-yard line, controversially ruled a catch on the field and upheld by the booth, despite replays appearing to show the ball being moved by contact with the ground as Meachem attempted to gather it. This is where the drive stalled; Hartley was called on to try the first field goal of the game and connected from 40 yards out, sending the Saints to their first Super Bowl after 43 years in the NFL.\nFour records were set in the game, three by Favre. He broke the career postseason pass attempts and passing yards records, but also set the record for most career postseason interceptions following his two picks in this game. It was the second time in three years that an interception thrown by Favre had helped to cost his team a conference championship, with his interception in overtime against the New York Giants in 2008 leading to a field goal that eliminated the Green Bay Packers. The Vikings outgained the Saints 475–257, which was the biggest yardage differential for a losing team in NFL postseason history. With his game winning kick Hartley joined Rich Karlis, Morten Andersen and Lawrence Tynes as the only four players in NFL history to score the winning points in a conference championship game decided in overtime. All four games were decided by field goals, with Hartley becoming the first to win an overtime game for the home team (in all three previous games, the home team was defeated). The two teams had nine fumbles between them in the game, with Peterson and Brees leading all players with two each. Minnesota fumbled six times and lost three of them. Peterson finished with 25 carries for 122 yards and three touchdowns, along with 2 receptions for 14 yards.\nThe outcome of this game was a factor in the NFL amending its rules during the ensuing offseason regarding overtime in playoff games, although the Vikings voted against the rule change. The change being that when the team receiving the ball first in overtime scores a field goal in their opening drive, the opposing team then gets a possession to try to score as well.\nThe excessive roughness of the Saints throughout the game was noted in the varied media broadcasts at the time, but its reputation became more controversial in 2012 with the publicity surrounding what would be known as Bountygate.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Vikings and Saints. Minnesota won both previous meetings, including the most recent meeting 34–16 in the 2000 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLIV: New Orleans Saints 31, Indianapolis Colts 17.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Saints and Colts."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The qualification and final rounds took place on September 18, 20, and 22nd at the Olympic Gymnastics Hall. There were 89 competitors from 23 nations. Each nation could send a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Vladimir Artemov of the Soviet Union, the nation's sixth victory in the event (then the most of any nation; Japan tied this total in 2016). The Soviets swept the medals, with Valeri Liukin taking silver and Dmitri Bilozertchev bronze. It was the third medal sweep in the men's all-around; France had done it in 1900 and Japan in 1972.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nTwo of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1984 Games returned, both from China: bronze medalist Li Ning and seventh-place finisher Xu Zhiqiang. The reigning (1987) World Champion was Dmitry Bilozerchev of the Soviet Union; his teammate Yuri Korolyov had won in 1985 and placed second behind Bilozerchev in 1987 but missed the Games due to an Achilles injury. Vladimir Artemov, also of the Soviet Union, had finished just behind Korolyov both years (second at the World Championships in 1985 and third in 1987), and was competing in the 1988 Olympics. The only non-Soviet to earn a medal in the men's all-around at either World Championship was East German Sylvio Kroll (third in 1985).\nChinese Taipei made its debut in the event. France made its 18th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format followed the preliminary and final format introduced in 1972, with the limit on the number of finalists per nation added in 1976. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final, with the top 36 gymnasts advancing to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these scores plus half of the preliminary score resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. With half of the preliminary score and six more exercises scored 0 to 10, the final total was also from 0 to 120.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals.\nResults.\nEighty-nine gymnasts competed in the all-around during the compulsory and optional rounds on September 18 and 20. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 22. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes each gymnast's \"prelim\" score."

        "title": "2014 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification was a series of tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 2014 FIFA World Cup featured 32 teams, with one place reserved for the host nation, Brazil. The remaining 31 places were determined by a qualification process, in which the other 207 teams, from the six FIFA confederations, competed. Most of the successful teams were determined within these confederations, with a limited number of inter-confederation play-offs occurring at the end of the process.\nBhutan, Brunei, Guam and Mauritania did not enter, and South Sudan joined FIFA after the qualification process started and therefore could not take part. The qualification process consisted of 820 matches, reduced from 828 after the late withdrawals of the Bahamas and Mauritius.\nThe first qualification match, between Montserrat and Belize, was played on 15 June 2011, and the Belizean striker Deon McCaulay scored the first goal in qualification. Qualification ended on 20 November 2013, when Uruguay eliminated Jordan to become the final qualifier for the World Cup. Twenty-three of FIFA's 24 top-ranked countries eventually qualified.\nQualification process.\nThe FIFA Executive Committee decided to approve the change of date for the preliminary draw of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was held six months earlier than in the past, to allow the confederations to begin their qualifying competitions in good time. The draw was held on 30 July 2011 at the Marina da Glória in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\nThe distribution by confederation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup is:\nUEFA and CAF have a guaranteed number of places, whereas the number of qualifiers from other confederations is dependent on play-offs between AFC's fifth-placed team and CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, and between CONCACAF's fourth-placed team and OFC's first-placed team. A draw determined the pairings between the four teams involved.\nTiebreakers.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a league format, the method used for separating teams level on points was the same for all confederations. If teams were even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams were ranked by:\nIf teams were still equal after applying all listed tiebreakers, then a single play-off at a neutral venue was played. If scores were level after ninety minutes in the play-off, then two fifteen-minute periods of extra time and, if necessary, a penalty shoot-out would determine the winners.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages using a home-and-away knockout format, the team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the away goals rule was applied (i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed). If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time were played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time (i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored). If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided via a penalty shoot-out.\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\nQualification began with two sets of two-leg knockout qualification rounds – the first held on 29 June and 2 July and 3 July 2011 and the second on 23 and 28 July – reducing the number of teams in the main draw to 20. The draw for the first two rounds of qualifiers was held in Kuala Lumpur on 30 March 2011.\nAs in the 2010 format, the third stage consisted of 5 groups of 4 teams (with matches held between September 2011 and February 2012) with the top 2 in each group advancing to 2 groups of 5 that played a further group stage during 2012. The top two teams in each group qualified for the 2014 World Cup directly, while the two third-placed teams engaged in a play-off tie for a chance to qualify via a further inter-confederation qualifying tie against a team from CONMEBOL.\nThe qualification process began with 43 national teams (out of 46 AFC members; Bhutan, Brunei and Guam did not enter) vying for four and a half spots. 4 nations have qualified: Japan, Australia, Iran and Korea Republic. Jordan beat Uzbekistan in round 5 and played Uruguay, the fifth-placed team from CONMEBOL, for the right to qualify, where they were eliminated.\nCAF.\n52 out of the 53 national associations affiliated to CAF entered the qualifying tournament to determine the continent's five slots for the next World Cup (only Mauritania failed to enter, while South Sudan joined FIFA after the start of qualifying).\nQualification began with a first round of 12 two-legged knockout ties, which were held between 11 and 16 November 2011. The ties involved the 24 lowest-ranked teams according to FIFA world rankings. The 12 winners joined the remaining 28 CAF entrants in the second round, which consisted of 10 groups of four. The winners of each group – held between June 2012 and September 2013 – advanced to a third round of 5 two-legged knockout ties. The five winners of these ties – held in October and November 2013 – advanced to the 2014 FIFA World Cup finals.\nCONCACAF.\nIn May 2010, the CONCACAF Executive Committee announced a possible change in its qualifying format for the 2014 World Cup, which would start with a preliminary knockout stage followed by three group phases. However, these proposals were abandoned. CONCACAF once again used a six-team final stage (known colloquially as \"the Hexagonal\"). The ten lowest-ranked nations played two-legged ties, with the five winners joining the nations ranked 7–25 in Round 2. There were six groups of four teams, with the six group winners joining the nations ranked 1–6 in Round 3. There were three groups of four teams and the top two teams in each group advanced to Round 4. These six nations formed one group, with the top three teams qualifying and Mexico, the fourth-placed team, advancing to the inter-continental play-off against New Zealand, the top team from the OFC.\nA total of 35 national teams began the qualification process vying for three and a half spots. 31 nations were eliminated and the Bahamas withdrew (because their stadium was not completed in time for the competition).\nCONMEBOL.\nAs Brazil had already qualified as host, the remaining nine CONMEBOL teams took part in a double round-robin group, playing each other twice (home and away) using the same schedule as previous qualification tournaments (each team had a bye on the date they would normally be scheduled to play Brazil). The top four teams qualified automatically, whereas Uruguay, the fifth-placed team, proceeded to the inter-confederational play-off against Jordan, the fifth placed team from Asia.\nOFC.\nThe four lowest-ranked nations (American Samoa, Cook Islands, Samoa, and Tonga) competed in the first round of qualifying: a single round-robin tournament in Apia, Samoa, from 22 to 26 November 2011. The winners of the group, Samoa, joined the remaining 7 OFC teams in the 2012 OFC Nations Cup, which also doubled as the second qualifying round. The four semi-finalists of the OFC Nations Cup advanced to the third round, which consisted of a double round-robin held on a home-and-away basis between 7 September 2012 and 26 March 2013.\nNew Zealand, as the winners of the third round, proceeded to the inter-confederation play-off against Mexico, the fourth-placed team from CONCACAF, where they were eliminated by a strong Mexico side who beat them 9–3 over two legs.\nUEFA.\nThe European qualification games started in September 2012, after Euro 2012. All 53 national associations affiliated with UEFA took part in the qualification process. In round one, teams competed in eight groups of six teams and a single group of five teams. The nine group winners qualified, while the eight best runners-up – ranked according to all their games except for games against the sixth-placed team in their group – entered into the play-offs for the four remaining spots.\nSecond round.\nThe Second Round was contested by the top eight runners-up. The second round draw took place at the headquarters of FIFA in Zürich, Switzerland, on 21 October. October 2013 FIFA World Rankings were used to decide which of the teams were seeded. The matches were played on 15 and 19 November 2013.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThere were two scheduled inter-confederation playoffs to determine the final two qualification spots to the finals. The first legs were played on 13 November 2013, and the second legs were played on 20 November 2013.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are goalscorer lists for all confederations and the inter-confederation play-offs:"

        "text": "The 1962 Daytona 500, was a NASCAR Grand National Series event that was held on February 18, 1962, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida.\nIt was won by Fireball Roberts driving a 1962 Pontiac. Roberts drove his famous number 22 to victory in three hours and 10 minutes. The race was run in its entirety without a single caution flag. Roberts dominated the event by leading 144 of the 200 laps. The win was Roberts' second victory of the season.\nSpeedweeks.\nThis year's Speedweeks followed a familiar pattern, Fireball was the class of the field. he won the pole for his qualifying race in his Smokey Yunick prepared 1962 Pontiac and again led from flag to flag, averaging over the 40 laps to set the all-time Grand National race speed record.\nThe Indy Invasion.\nFor the top Indianapolis drivers, including the three previous winners of the Indianapolis 500--A. J. Foyt, Rodger Ward and Jim Rathmann—this was irresistible. They clamored to get the United States Auto Club (which had replaced the AAA as the nation's leading auto racing sanctioned body) to lift its ban on racing at Daytona, but USAC, which sanctioned the Indy 500, would not budge. It wanted the drivers to focus on its own stock car racing series. The Indy drivers would have to wait another year.\nRace Day.\nA furious battle erupted right from the green flag. Five different drivers traded the lead during the first 50 laps, including Joe Weatherly, who had won his qualifying race. Few, if anyone, paid attention when the no. 52 Ford dropped out of the race on lap four with electrical problems. Behind the wheel was 22-year-old Cale Yarborough of Timmonsville, South Carolina, destined to finish last in the 48-car field.\nThe pitched battle at the front saw Roberts lead the 15th lap, Cotton Owens lead on lap 16, Junior Johnson on lap 17 and Roberts again on lap 18. The blistering pace allowed the front-runners to lap nearly the entire field. But Yunick's flat-out strategy caused Roberts to run out of gas twice in the early going. During pit stops, Roberts pulled down his window by hand, just like a passenger car driver, to accept a drink.\nNot far behind the front-runners was Richard Petty. He took the lead for the first time on lap 42. Petty was in a Plymouth that had started 10th, but his car was at least slower than Roberts' Pontiac. Petty's team decided to try Junior Johnson's 1960 race-winning strategy and stay with Roberts at all costs, to draft him incessantly and pit when he did. Lee Petty, still limping from his devastating 1961 crash, stalked the pits during the last , placed his hands on his lips, his cigar in his mouth, with his intention on watching the battle on the track.\nBut this time, Roberts would not be denied. His nerves were frayed by the fear of yet another late race calamity, but he nonetheless turned laps at more than in the late going and gradually distanced himself from Petty. Roberts won by 27 seconds. Petty finished second, becoming the only other driver on the lead lap.\nIt was Fireball's only Daytona 500 victory. He would die two years later from a fiery crash in the World 600."

The event was won by Marius Urzică of Romania, the nation's first victory in the men's pommel horse. France earned its first medal in the event, with Eric Poujade's silver. Bronze went to Alexei Nemov of Russia, his second consecutive bronze medal in the event. Urzică (silver medalist in 1996) and Nemov were the eighth and ninth men to win multiple medals in the pommel horse.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Four of the eight finalists from 1996 returned: silver medalist Marius Urzică of Romania, bronze medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, and fourth-place finisher Patrice Casimir and seventh-place finisher Eric Poujade of France. Nemov was the reigning (1999) world champion, with Urzică the runner-up.\nLatvia made its debut in the men's pommel horse. The United States made its 18th appearance, most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 pommel horse and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 gymnastics competition had introduced the \"7–6–5\" format, in which each team had 7 members, designated 6 for each apparatus, and had 5 count for team scores. In 2000, this was reduced across the board to a \"6–5–4\" format. Further, while in 1996 all 7 team members could compete on each apparatus for individual purposes, in 2000 only the 5 designated for that apparatus competed. The 2000 competition also eliminated the compulsory exercises; only voluntary exercises were done on each apparatus. The qualifying round scores were used for qualification for the team all-around, individual all-around, and apparatus finals.\nThe top eight gymnasts, with a limit of two per nation, advanced to the final. Non-finalists were ranked 9th through 80th based on preliminary score. The preliminary score had no effect on the final; once the eight finalists were selected, their ranking depended only on the final exercise.\nResults.\nQualifying.\nEighty gymnasts competed in the pommel horse event during the qualification round on September 16. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 24. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final."

There were 78 competitors from 29 nations; nations competing in the team event could have up to 5 gymnasts in the vault, while other nations could have up to 2 gymnasts. The event was won by Szilveszter Csollány of Hungary, the nation's first victory in the rings. Csollány, who had taken silver in 1996, became the eighth man to win multiple medals in the event. The silver this time went to Dimosthenis Tampakos of Greece—the first medal in the event for a Greek gymnast since 1896. Yordan Yovchev earned Bulgaria's first rings medal since 1960 with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920).

The \"Lord of the Rings,\" defending Olympic champion and five-time world champion, Jury Chechi of Italy was injured and unable to compete; reigning world champion Dong Zhen of China was also not competing. In their absence, Csollány (silver at both 1997 and 1999 world championships as well as at Athens 1996) was the favorite to finally win a global championship.\nLatvia made its debut in the men's rings.

        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The qualification and final rounds took place on September 16 and 20 at the Sydney SuperDome. There were 97 competitors from 32 nations. Each nation could enter a team of 6 gymnasts (returning to the longstanding team size after one Games of teams of 7 in 1996) or up to 2 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Alexei Nemov of Russia, the nation's first victory in the event. Nemov, with a silver medal in 1996, became the 12th man to earn multiple medals in the all-around. Yang Wei of China took silver. Oleksandr Beresch earned bronze, Ukraine's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nThree of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1996 Games returned: silver medalist Alexei Nemov of Russia, seventh-place finisher John Roethlisberger of the United States, and tenth-place finisher Blaine Wilson of the United States. Russia's Nikolai Kryukov was the reigning (1999) World Champion; Ivan Ivankov of Belarus had won the 1997 World Championship.\nLatvia made its debut in the event. France made its 21st appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nMajor changes to the competition format were implemented in 2000. The competition continued to use a preliminary (qualifying) round and a final round, with scores cleared between rounds (no carryover). However, the preliminary round now used only one optional exercise for each apparatus rather than requiring both a compulsory and optional exercise. The team event scoring used a 6–5–4 format (each team had 6 gymnasts, selected 5 per apparatus, with 4 scores counting), a reduced version of the 1996 7–6–5 system, which reduced the number of gymnasts competing in every apparatus. Total scores and an overall rank were still used for all gymnasts, however. 2000 was also the year where the tie-breaking rules came into effect, which resulted in far less tie rankings or duplicate of medals than at the Games before that. Each exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus the total preliminary score was from 0 to 60. The final total, with six exercises, was from 0 to 60.\nResults.\nThere were 97 gymnasts that competed during the qualification round on September 16, though only 52 competed on each apparatus. Fifty-three gymnasts competed in the all-around during the qualification round. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 16. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final."

        "text": "Sailing Along is a 1938 British musical comedy film directed by Sonnie Hale and starring Jessie Matthews, Barry MacKay, Jack Whiting, Roland Young, Frank Pettingell, Noel Madison and Alastair Sim. It includes many staged song and dance routines either on barges or on the dock edge.\nPlot.\nA rich owner of a fleet of three-masted barges operating on the River Thames in central London has a prospective step-daughter, Kay. She falls in love with the son of one of his barge masters, who has been put to work on a barge at the bottom of the ladder. She initially wants to give up her chance of stardom as a singer to be with him. Ultimately everyone supports her singing career.\nProduction.\n\"Sailing Along\" was filmed at Pinewood Studios from August to December 1937, directed by Sonnie Hale. The screenplay was written by Lesser Samuels and Sonnie Hale, based on a story by Selwyn Jepson. For the last big dance number—which lasted seven minutes on screen—the camera followed Whiting and Matthews for nearly a mile, and the set was so large that it had to be built across two studios. Including rehearsals, the pair danced an estimated twenty miles to complete that single scene.\nRelease.\nThe film opened at the Gaumont Haymarket on 17 April 1938, and was generally released on 29 August 1938.\nCritical reception.\nIn a contemporary review, \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"The best features of the film are the songs and the dances which are cleverly treated, particularly in the final sequence where Kay and Dicky perform a really original and brilliantly executed tap ballet. Jessie Matthews acts Kay with unrestrained gaiety and fire, sings adequately and dances superbly. Jack Whiting, as Dicky, matches her in dancing ability and outshines her in singing and acting, Barry Mackay tries hard not to make Steve too imbecile, while Roland Young (Gulliver) and Athene Seyler, as his prim sister, serve up a banquet of laughs from the few crumbs that fall their way.\"\nIn his review for \"The Era\" on 27 January 1938, R.B. Marriott applauded Hale's direction as \"swift, gay and witty\", and added that \"\"Sailing Along\" was certainly the most polished romantic comedy with music ever made in our studios: and for vitality, deftness and general entertainment value it equals any, and is superior to, many that have come from that over-rated motion picture making town across the Atlantic Ocean.\""

Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Angelo Gremo, Giovanni Gerbi, and Giovanni Rossignoli. Frenchman Jean Alavoine who had some high placings in the Tour de France, along with the successful Belgian cyclist Marcel Buysse started the race.\nEvents.\nThe first stage was won by Giuseppe Oliveri, who beat his two team mate Gremo and Belloni in a sprint, having distanced the rest of the field by more than ten minutes. In that stage, the defending champion Costante Girardengo had an accident, which made him lose time.\nIn the second stage, Oliveri and Girardengo both abandoned.\nBelloni won the second stage, and became the new leader in the race. Belloni also won the third stage; Girardengo's team had left the race at that point.\nIn the fourth stage, Alavoine attacked, and won by more than half an hour. \nIn the fifth stage, Alavoine sprinted to the victory, but second-placed Torricelli complained to the jury. The jury accepted Torricelli's complaints, and Torricelli became the winner of the stage. The Legnano team did not think that this penalty was sufficient, and left the race. This meant that only the Bianchi-Pirelli team was left in the race, together with some isolated riders. Commenters said that this Giro had been sick since the second stage, but that it was dead after the fifth stage. In that fifth stage, Belloni lost time, and Gremo became the new leader.\nThe seventh stage was the deciding stage: Belloni won much time on his competitors.\nIn the last stage, there were only ten riders left.

When they reached the hippodrome, they were sent to the wrong entrance. Schierano, coming slightly later, used the correct entrance, and he reached the finish first. Initially, the jury said that Schierano won the stage, and that all other riders were ex aequo in second place, but later the jury decided to nullify the results. Times taken at the entrance of the velodrome were used for the general classification, and stage prizes were shared among all riders.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were ten cyclists who had completed all ten stages.

Masterclasses with swim coaches are also held round the country.\nIn 2006/7, the OSS ran the Breaststrokes charity swims in Windermere and the Serpentine, which raised over £150,000 for Cancer Research. The OSS' patrons are the Olympic gold medallist Cassie Patten and the author Robert Macfarlane."

        "title": "Freddy and the Baseball Team from Mars",
        "text": "Freddy and the Baseball Team from Mars (1955) is the 23rd book in the humorous children's series Freddy the Pig by American author Walter R. Brooks, illustrated by Kurt Wiese. Capitalizing on Martians' ability to pitch with any of four arms, Freddy creates a baseball team of Martians and circus animals to compete against neighboring towns. An old foe of Freddy's tries to rig the games.\nPlot summary.\nFreddy's ice skating with the animals on the bean farm is interrupted by a request from Mr. Boomschmidt, the circus owner, to find a kidnapped Martian. \"Mr. Boom\", already anticipating that Freddy will solve the case with his detective skills, muses that the Martians could use a more interesting activity than being a circus sideshow. Since they are fast and accurate throwers, the pig suggests a baseball team.\nThe immediate problem is finding the missing Martian, Squeak-squeak. A suspect is the criminal Anderson, whom Freddy has thwarted before, and who loiters around the circus. Since Freddy must remain unknown during his investigation, he dons the disguise of an old baseball coach named Henry Arquebus with glasses, an overcoat, and large beard, and moves to town. He cautiously lures Anderson into friendship. Freddy is puzzled when the Martians, at first eager for his help, now refuse to discuss Squeak-Squeak. Mr. Boom is certain they are in trouble, and encourages Freddy to investigate, anyhow.\nThe Martians are enthusiastic about baseball, especially after learning that the purpose of baseball is not, as they thought, to hit the batter and knock him unconscious. Practice begins on a muddy bean farm field. There are four Martians; most of the rest of the team are circus animals.\nFreddy sets the robin Mr. J. J. Pomeroy, the head of the A.B.I. (Animal Bureau of Investigation), to watch the Martians and Anderson. Apparently unrelatedly, his rich friend Mrs. Church asks Freddy to investigate a burglary by a ghost in her house. Since the stolen necklace is costume jewelry worth only 25 cents, Freddy suggests a reward for \"one third the value\".\nThe team practices for a month, and spectators watch. Freddy (in his disguise as Mr. Arquebus) tells the Martians to swing at every pitch, no matter how wild. Freddy will not explain the reason for this, but apparently it has to do with the trick planned for the manager of the Tushville baseball team, Mr. Kurtz, who used professionals the previous year in an amateur game.\nDespite being somewhat frightened, Freddy and Jinx the cat stake out Mrs. Church's house at night to confront the ghost. The burglar ghost proves human, but it escapes; and as no entry footprints could be found in the snow, Freddy and Mrs. Church still can not figure out how the burglar could have gotten in.\nThe first practice game draws many spectators, and Kurtz reckons that the game against his Tushville team will get a thousand paying tickets. He offers Mr. Boom a deal where the winner takes two-thirds of the receipts. The strange Martian pitching proves effective, but at bat, Freddy has them swing at any pitch. The other team members do the hitting and scoring. In the end, the Martians lose, 8–6.\nAnderson returns the stolen necklace to Mrs. Church, claiming he is acting for another. (He is shocked and angered by the 10¢ reward, as he thought the necklace was genuine.) As his house is watched by the A.B.I, Freddy knows there is not another person, that Anderson is the thief, and that furthermore his main motive was to make Mrs. Church think her house is haunted, so that he could buy it cheaply and sell it at a higher price. When Freddy notices house paint on the Martian's flying saucer, he deduces that Anderson holds Squeak-squeak prisoner, and is forcing the Martians to help him steal; that it is with the help of the flying saucer that Anderson has entered houses undetected. An investigation of Anderson's house shows that Squeak-squeak was moved, and a telephone conversation between Anderson and an accomplice is overheard, during which Anderson calls the accomplice \"Herb\". Squeak-squeak is not there, but they find jewelry from other recent robberies.\nThe game with Tushville starts reasonably, for example with an elephant sliding into third base (\"...when an elephant slides, something has to go.\") With the elephant on third, Freddy reveals his plan, telling the two-foot Martians not to swing at anything. With the strike zone reduced to eight inches, the Martians walk every time at bat. They take the lead until the crook Anderson whispers something to them. The Martians disobey coach Freddy, start swinging, and lose the game.\nMrs. Peppercorn — from whom Freddy is renting in town — cheers him with her improved version of a Longfellow poem, for example changing:\nThe poet-pig is not enormously impressed, but is shaken out of his funk and soon wonders if coach Kurtz is Anderson's accomplice; a telephone call proved that his name is Herb. Anderson approaches \"Mr. Arquebus\", asking help with a burglary. Since Freddy will be able to get proof, he agrees. When the flying saucer drops Anderson in a wealthy home, Freddy leaves and calls the police. Knowing where to look for Squeak-squeak the Martian allows Freddy to infiltrate Kurtz's house in yet another disguise, this time as an Irish widow. However, the Martian is securely locked away. With the help of a group of wasps, Freddy captures the Kurtzes, but when Anderson arrives with the police, the lawmen are unable to make sense of the confusion. They decide to lock everybody in the basement so that they can go see the baseball game. Mr. Boom finally arrives and frees all of them right in the middle of the game. The Martians can now play ball without fear, and they begin walking again, but Anderson has not given up. Mr. Boom is so tired from sawing through the basement door that he cannot play, and Freddy takes his place, pulling off his disguise as the crowd cheers. Anderson attempts to sabotage the game by blinding the batters with a mirror, but his plan fails and he is captured and sent to jail. Freddy and the Martians finally win the game, 12–11.\nIllustrations.\nThere are 40 black and white, pen and ink drawings by Kurt Wiese, endpapers, a frontispiece and a full color cover, all depicting scenes from the book. Each chapter starts with a half page illustration, while a full-page illustration is placed close to an event within each chapter.\nCritical reception.\nBooks in the series received moderately positive to strongly positive critical review in sources such as the \"Times Literary Supplement\", and \"Hornbook\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Kirkus Reviews\".\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" (Sept. 17, 1955) \"...our inimitable pig goes to bat for Mars again...news travels fast and it is a distressing blow to hear that Squeak-squeak, one of the Martians, has disappeared mysteriously. Through complicated but of course expertly planned strategy, Freddy finds Squeak-squeak, to the delight of his companions...It is to our delight too, and the baseball victory that hinges on Squeak-squeak's reappearance is knowingly reported.\"\nPublication history.\nThe first edition was published in hardcover in 1955 by Knopf. The price was $3.00 (over $19.00 in 2007 USD). The book was republished in 1999 by the Overlook Press using the original illustrations, text and layout."

Her results from the 1999 World Championships and 2000 Olympics were deleted from the records, and the FIG recommended that the IOC disqualify the Chinese all-around team and strip them of the bronze medal. The IOC agreed with the recommendation, and reallocated the bronze medals on April 28, 2010.

Small reached the first major ranking final of his career when he defeated Michie 6–2. Small won the first four frames, which included a 41-minute frame two that Michie lost because of a tight battle on the pink ball. Small produced a break of 77 in the third. After the mid-session interval, Michie won frames five and six but breaks of 36, 37, 43 and 39 won the match for Small, who commented on his delight to reach the final, \"When I was a youngster I watched the snooker on television and thought how great it must be to play in a major final. Now I've done it at last and I'm determined to enjoy it. It's a dream come true and I can't wait.\"\nThe other semi-final saw McManus reach his 15th career final with a 6–4 victory over Davis in a match that lasted almost five hours. McManus won three frames on the pink ball and made breaks of 78, 50 and 76 to win the match. A male spectator was ejected from the Preston Guild Hall during frame eight for audible snoring and it was twice restarted because of separate safety shot stalemates. After the game, McManus called it \"one of the hardest matches of my life\" after he did not pot a single ball because of extended table play from Davis, \"Halfway through I felt like a couldn't pot a ball so I'm pleased to have got through. I think it will be a different game in the final because Chris goes for his shots. It's a big match for both of us.\"\nFinal.\nThe all-Scottish best-of-17 final happened on 13 October. McManus led 3–1 with successive breaks of 62 and 73. Small reduced McManus' lead by one frame with a half century break before McManus produced a 62 run to lead 4–2. Small produced a 69 break in frame seven and won the eighth to end the first session level at 4–4. When play resumed in the second session, a break of 62 from Small after McManus missed a mid-range red ball to a top corner pocket for the lead. More safety errors from McManus gave Small a chance to produce breaks of 47 and 27 in frame ten as the former did not record a single point in this period. McManus took the 11th frame after Small failed to pot the last red ball along the top . Small took the next three frames to win the match 9–5. The match lasted 6 hours and 13 minutes. Aged 29 and a 150/1 outsider, he became the first non-top 16 ranked player to win a ranking tournament since O'Brien at the 1999 British Open.\nIt transpired to be the only ranking event victory of Small's career having retired from professional snooker three years later as a result of his affliction. Small earned £82,500 for the win. Post-match, Small dedicated his victory to his grandmother who died three years prior, \"I held her hand in hospital the day before she died and when she asked me to win a tournament for her one day, I promised her I would. Now I've done it, so I just hope she was up there looking down and watching my victory.\" He also said it felt \"like a dream\", and would use the winnings to pay the mortgage on his house. McManus said he was pleased for Small and did not believe his game with Davis wore him out despite appearing visibly tired, \"But from my point of view it was an anti-climax. It was not a great match but Chris was solid and if I left anything sticking out he knocked it in. But I'm delighted for him, he's a lovely lad and he deserves this victory after all he's been through.\"\nThe victory, according to Phil Yates of \"The Times\", made Small possibly, \"one of the most unlikely winners of a leading competition for years\" because of his reputation of being a journeyman and him requiring monthly injections to reduce the effect of his spinal condition.\nMain draw.\nThe numbers in the box to the left of the player is their seeding.

It is a recreational league founded to develop better relations between New York Police and the immigrant communities within the city. The league is unofficial and is not recognized by United States of America Cricket Association. Its main goal is to have good understanding and relationship with immigrant communities living in New York City.\nNYPD Support.\nNYPD Community Affairs officers conducted outreach through community groups, youth programs and businesses in the five boroughs; they also promoted the tournament through local New York adult cricket leagues. The NYPD Twenty20 Cricket Cup is an extension of the Department's New Immigrant Outreach initiative that aims to establish positive ongoing relations with multiple ethnic groups including the Muslim and South Asian communities.\nParticipation for all players is free. The Police Department provides a professional color uniform kit with a hat, pants, and jersey as well as T-shirts and hats for the coaches. Coaches are volunteers. Cricket matches are played in Brooklyn at the Gateway Cricket Ground in Spring Creek Park and in Kissena Park in Queens using mats for pitches. Caps, jerseys, and pants are provided to players by the New York City Police Foundation, in various colors resembling international, professional team uniforms.\n2008 season.\nNew York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly introduced a citywide cricket league for teenagers, administered by the NYPD Community Affairs Bureau. The league was open to youth ages 14 to 19. A majority of those who have signed up to play that summer were of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Guyanese descent; others are Trinidadian, Jamaican, and Indian (South Asian). Six teams of 15 players each – including the \"Pak Brighton\", \"Punjab\", \"Cosmos\", \"Panthers\", \"Superstars\", and \"Knight Riders\" played every Wednesday and Thursday, weather permitting, from July 23 until late August. The tournament culminated in a championship game on August 20, 2008. Matches were organized by the NYPD Community Affairs Bureau and umpired by New York State certified umpires. The cricket tournament was organized just after the NYPD United Soccer league, which was established in May.\n2009 season.\nA large crowd turned out on June 13 to celebrate the launch of the 2009 NYPD Cricket season. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was there to announce that this season will be 'bigger and better' with 10 teams competing for the Twenty/20 Cup. Matches will be played in two locations this year in Brooklyn and Queens.\nAfter a very successful inaugural season in 2008, the league expanded to include more players, teams, and games. The 2009 NYPD Cricket season will feature 10 teams and roughly 170 players from all five boroughs, an increase from the 2008 season when 6 teams and 100 players took part.\nTeams including the \"Pak Brighton\", \"Punjab\", \"Tigers\", \"Warriors\", \"Dragons\", \"West Indies Kings\", \"Superstars\", \"Lycans\",and \"Knight Riders\" began play on June 23 and will culminate play with a championship game on August 25. As was the case in the 2008 season, the 2009 games followed a Twenty20 format and were umpired by New York State certified umpires."

A number of them have made great contributions this season, especially towards the success of the 1st XI.\nThe 3rd XI, playing in only their second season, dominated Division 13 from the outset and won it comfortably.

        "title": "List of Green Bay Packers Pro Bowl selections",
        "text": "The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers have competed in the National Football League (NFL) since 1921, two years after their original founding by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun. They are members of the North Division of the National Football Conference (NFC) and play their home games at Lambeau Field in central Wisconsin.\nStarting with the 1938 NFL season, the NFL instituted an All-Star Game that pitted the league's championship team against a team made-up of the best players from the remaining teams. Five of these exhibition games were played, with the last occurring after the 1942 NFL season before the NFL reduced the number of teams and games in the season due to players serving in World War II. The first official Pro Bowl occurred in 1951 following the 1950 NFL season. From the 1950 season until the 1969 season, the exhibition game was played between teams representing the Eastern and Western Conferences of the NFL. After the American Football League (AFL) merged with the NFL in 1970, the game was played between teams representing the NFC and the American Football Conference (AFC). The conference team format remained until 2014 when the NFL shifted to a fantasy football format with teams selected by captains from the full pool of Pro Bowl selectees. This format only lasted for three seasons before it reverted back to the conference team format from the 2016 to 2021 NFL seasons; this period included the cancellation of the 2021 Pro Bowl due to the COVID-19 pandemic (teams were still selected and players were still recognized as Pro Bowl selectees). Starting with the 2023 Pro Bowl after the 2022 NFL season, the NFL again changed the format; instead of playing an exhibition game, the Pro Bowl was converted to series of skill competitions that culminated in a non-contact flag football game.\nPro Bowl selections are made by a cumulative vote by three groups that hold equal weight: coaches, players and fans. Based on the results of the vote, each team is filled out based on generic positions on offense, defense and special teams. Prior to the institution of the Pro Bowl Games in 2023, the players with the most votes were named starters, while the remainder of the selectees were reserves. In the event that a Pro Bowl selectee is unable to participate in the Pro Bowl, either due to health reasons or the fact they are playing in the Super Bowl right after the Pro Bowl, alternates are named in the players' place. These players are still considered official Pro Bowl selectees. The coaching staffs for each team have been selected in various ways, with the common option being the coaching staffs of the team with the best record in each conference who were not going to the Super Bowl given the honors. With the onset of the Pro Bowl Games, the NFL now selects the coaching staffs for the flag football game. Players for each team are paid for their participation, with a higher sum going to the winning team. Throughout the life of the Pro Bowl, awards have been given out to recognize the best player or players of the game. From 2016 to 2022, an award was given to an offensive and defensive most valuable player (MVP).\nThe Packers have had representatives at the Pro Bowl every year since 1950 except for nine seasons. The Packers' first selections in the inaugural Pro Bowl in 1951 were running back Billy Grimes and defensive tackle Ed Neal. The 1963 Pro Bowl and 1968 Pro Bowl each included nine Packers, the most that the team has ever sent to the Pro Bowl. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers holds the team record for most Pro Bowl selections with 10, while Forrest Gregg (nine selections), Brett Favre (nine selections) and Willie Wood (eight selections) round out the top four. Four Packers have been given a Pro Bowl MVP award. The most recent Pro Bowl selectee for the Packers was Kenny Clark for the 2024 Pro Bowl Games."

He also coached in the National Football League (NFL) from 1999 to 2005 and from 2007 to 2012.\nEarly life.\nMiller graduated in 1988 from Plum High School in Plum, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He also earned a bachelor's degree in communications from Clarion University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree in education from Robert Morris University.\nCoaching career.\nMiller's first exposure to the professional sports scene was as a public relations intern. He held internships with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts. During this time, he also helped the scouting department and learned the inner workings of the coaching profession. He gained valuable experience in his first coaching opportunity as a running backs coach and graduate assistant at Robert Morris University where he coached under veteran NFL coaches Joe Walton and Dan Radakovich.\nIn 1999, Bill Cowher offered Miller his first professional coaching position as an offensive quality control coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers At this position, Miller worked closely with offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey. When Mularkey was hired as head coach for the Buffalo Bills, Miller was offered a position on his staff as tight ends and quality control Coach in 2004 and 2005. Following Mularkey's dismissal, Miller landed a coaching job with the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europa in 2006. \nIn 2007, Ken Whisenhunt was named as head coach of the Arizona Cardinals and offered Miller a position on his staff. Like Mularkey, Whisenhunt first worked with Miller on the Steelers coaching staff. Miller spent the 2007 and 2008 seasons as the wide receivers coach. In 2008, his top two receivers Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin were named to the Pro Bowl. Also in 2008, Fitzgerald, Boldin and Steve Breaston each gained over 1000 receiving yards, a feat only accomplished five times in NFL history. Miller was promoted to Arizona's pass game coordinator (2009–2010) and offensive coordinator (2011–2012). Miller helped the team reach Super Bowl XLIII in 2009. \nMiller joined the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in 2013 as the assistant head coach, offensive coordinator, and quarterbacks coach under the new head coach Dan Hawkins. The Alouettes were the first offense in CFL history to have four starting quarterbacks each record two wins in a season. \nIn 2014, Miller became the offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, and receivers coach for Edinboro University of Pennsylvania. Edinboro's offense led the country with 80% completion percentage and set single season reception record. \nFollowing a two-year stint as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Robert Morris (2016–2017), Miller served in 2018 as defensive coordinator and defensive line coach Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania. In 2019, Miller moved to a part-time role as Westminster's offensive consultant and assistant offensive line coach having accepted the receivers coaching position with the New York Guardians of the XFL.\nOn January 19, 2022, it was announced that Miller had joined the Toronto Argonauts as the team's quarterbacks coach, overseeing veteran starter McLeod Bethel-Thompson and backup quarterbacks Chad Kelly and Ben Holmes. Under Miller, Bethel-Thompson threw for a CFL-high 4,731 passing yards during the regular CFL season and helped lead the Argos to an upset victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the 109th Grey Cup. Backup Kelly was also critical in helping lead the Argos to the championship win by stepping in for the injured Bethel-Thompson in the fourth quarter to lead the Argo's on their game winning scoring drive.

Jones played in just two international matches, but became a Triple Crown winner when he represented Wales during the 1902 Home Nations Championship.\nRugby career.\nAlthough little is recorded about Jones, he is listed as originally playing rugby for Porth Scarlets a now defunct Rhondda club. By the time he was selected to represent Wales in 1902, he was playing club rugby for Penygraig RFC, a more successful valley club that had supplied several players to the international squad since 1896. The 1902 Championship had already begun, with Wales victorious over England in their opening fixture, when Jones was called in as a replacement for Llanelli's Nathaniel Walters. Jones' first game was a home match against reigning Home Nations Champions Scotland. Although Scotland were favourites to win, a fluent Welsh team won the game comfortably, scoring four tries to Scotland's one. After this victory the Welsh selectors kept faith with the side, refusing to make a single change for the final game of the tournament, away to Ireland. Wales beat Ireland 15-0, and lifted their third Championship and Triple Crown titles. Despite now being a Championship winner and never playing in a losing game, Jones was replaced the next season by George Travers, and never represented Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "High-performance sailing",
        "text": "High-performance sailing is achieved with low forward surface resistance—encountered by catamarans, sailing hydrofoils, iceboats or land sailing craft—as the sailing craft obtains motive power with its sails or aerofoils at speeds that are often faster than the wind on both upwind and downwind points of sail. Faster-than-the-wind sailing means that the apparent wind angle experienced on the moving craft is always ahead of the sail. This has generated a new concept of sailing, called \"apparent wind sailing\", which entails a new skill set for its practitioners, including tacking on downwind points of sail.\nHistory.\nFrank Bethwaite offers the following chronology of key advances in sailing technology that provided the essential elements of high-performance sailing:\nHigh-performance sailing craft.\nHigh-performance watercraft that can exceed the speed of the true wind include sailing catamarans and foiling sailing craft. Ice boats and land-sailing craft are often able to do so. There are also wind-powered vehicles that can travel faster than the wind, such as the rotor-powered \"Blackbird\", which are outside the scope of this article.\nSkiffs.\nStarting ca. 1975, 18ft Skiffs were sailing downwind faster than the speed of the wind. This meant that they had to tack, rather than jibe to change tacks. Other skiffs that can sail faster than the wind include the 29er, and 49er, both designed by Julian Bethwaite.\nMultihulls.\nIn 2013, a new class of catamaran was announced for the America's Cup which can achieve well in excess of double the speed of the wind. The catamarans used for the 2013 America's Cup were expected to sail upwind at 1.2 times the speed of the true wind, and downwind at 1.6 times the speed of the true wind. They proved to be faster, averaging about 1.8 times the speed of the wind with peaks slightly over 2.0.\nThe Extreme 40 catamaran can sail at in winds. The high-performance International C-Class Catamaran can sail at twice the speed of the wind.\nHydrofoils.\nThere are many varieties of sailing hydrofoils. Monohull examples include the International Moth, Laser, and AC75. America's Cup catamarans have used hydrofoils, since 2013. Other foiling catamarans include, A-Class, C-Class, Nacra 17, Nacra F20, and GC32.\nIn 2009, hydrofoil trimaran, \"Hydroptère\", set the world speed sailing record on water at , sailing at about 1.7 times the speed of the wind. In late 2012, \"Vestas Sailrocket 2\" achieved a new outright world speed record of on water, at around 2.5 times the speed of the wind.\nIceboats.\nIceboats on the Hudson River of New York in the second half of the 19th century were as long as and sailed as fast as , a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the \"Icicle\". Iceboats designs dating from the mid 20th century onwards typically consist of a triangular or cross-shaped frame, supported by three skate blades called \"runners\", with the steering runner in front. Runners are made of iron or steel with sharpened edges, which hold onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind in the sails, as they develop propulsive lift. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can typically sail at five to six times the speed of the wind. Classic iceboats and Skeeters have reached speeds of . Record speeds are for a Skeeter: \"Das Boot\", and for a classic iceboat: \"Debutaunte\", .\nLand-sailing craft.\nBy sailing downwind at 135° off the wind, a land-sailing craft can sail much faster than the wind. The velocity made good downwind is often over twice as fast compared to the same craft sailing directly downwind. In 2009, the world land speed record for a wind-powered vehicle was set by the sailing craft, \"Greenbird\", sailing at about three times the speed of the wind with a recorded top speed of .\nApparent wind sailing.\nWhereas iceboats have been able to exceed the speed of the wind, both upwind and downwind for a century, this capability only became routine with the evolution of 18 ft Skiffs in the third quarter of the 20th century when their speed tripled from that of the 1950s. Craft that sail faster than the speed of the wind, downwind as well as upwind, are capable of tacking downwind because the apparent wind is always ahead of the mast. This led to the concept of \"apparent wind sailing\".\nApparent wind.\nApparent wind is the wind velocity (direction and speed), VA, measured aboard a moving sailing craft; it is the net effect (vector sum) of the \"boat wind\", VB—the air flow over the craft induced by its speed over the earth (equal to in magnitude, but opposite in direction to the craft's speed)—and the \"true wind\", VT. The apparent wind measured aboard a craft under power, traveling in calm conditions, VT = 0 knots, would come from directly ahead and at a speed that is the same as the boat speed over the bottom (VA = VB + 0 = VB). If the craft travels at VB = 10 knots with a tailwind of VT = -5 knots, it experiences an apparent wind of VA = 5 knots directly on the bow (VA = VB + VT = 10 − 5). The apparent wind experienced by a stationary craft is the true wind speed. If a craft proceeds at 90° to a true wind of VT = 10 knots, itself traveling at a speed inducing VB = 10 knots, then the apparent wind angle would be 45° off the bow and the apparent wind speed would be about 14 knots, calculated as: square root [(VB )2 + (VT )2] = square root [102 + 102] = 14.14. As the craft becomes faster than the true wind, the apparent wind is always ahead of the sail.\nWhen drag angle of the hull is negligible, the formulas for calculating VA and \"β\" (the apparent wind angle) are:\nSail power.\nA sail generates lift with a and a sideways component, based on an optimum angle of attack that is constrained by the apparent wind, VA, being forward of and approximately aligned with the sail.\nBeta theorem.\nGarrett introduces the beta theorem (or course theorem) as a way to understand how apparent wind angle results from the interplay between the driving force from the wind and the resisting force from the water (or hard surface), the result of the net effect of two counteracting foils, the sail in the air and the keel in the water. When one resolves the ratio of lift to drag for each in its medium, the resulting motion of the sailing craft resolves to an angle, \"beta\" (\"β\"), between the apparent wind and the course over the water. The hull (below the water) and the sailing rig (above the water) each have drag angle with respect to the medium flowing past them (water or air), they are \"λ\" and \"αm\" in the accompanying diagram. The sum of those two drag angles are equal to \"β,\" the angle between the apparent wind and the course sailed (\"β\" = \"λ\" + \"αm\"). This theorem applies for every point of sail. A small \"β\" denotes high efficiency and a potential for high speed. As forward velocity increases, \"β\" becomes smaller; on sailing craft with effective underwater foils the drag angle of the hull, \"λ\", becomes smaller with increased speed, it becomes negligible with hydrofoiling craft, and essentially nonexistent for ice boats and land sailing craft.\nApparent-wind-angle limit.\nGiven an ideal circumstance of a frictionless surface and an airfoil that can develop power, there is no theoretical limit to how fast a sailing craft can travel off the wind as the apparent wind angle becomes ever smaller. In reality, both sail efficiency and friction provide an upper limit. Speed is determined by the ratio of power developed by the sail over power lost through various forms of drag (e.g. surface drag and aerodynamic drag). Ideally a smaller sail is better, as speeds increase. Unfortunately, a small sail diminishes the ability for a craft—even an iceboat—to accelerate to speeds faster than the wind. The principal limit to speed in high-performance sailing craft is form drag. Efforts to overcome this limit is evident in the streamlined hulls of high-performance iceboats and the improvements in drag reduction on planing dinghies. A fast iceboat can achieve an apparent wind of 7.5° and a speed of six times the true wind speed on a course that is 135° off the wind. Bethwaite suggests this might be a practical limit for a craft powered by sails.\nPoints of sail.\nThe points of sail at which high-performance sailing craft can achieve highest speeds and achieve the best speed made good over a course span between a \"beam reach\" (90° to the \"true wind\") and a \"broad reach\" (about 135° away from the true wind). According to Bethwaite, having made comparative measurements in a true wind of , a displacement Soling can achieve speeds slightly higher than the true wind and sail 30° off the apparent wind, whereas a planing 18-foot Skiff achieves speeds of almost at an apparent wind of 20° and an iceboat can achieve at an apparent wind of 8°.\nUnder apparent wind sailing, the objective is to keep the apparent wind as far forward, as practical, for the course sailed in order to attain the fastest course made good to the objective. This requires a craft that can exceed the true windspeed, both upwind and downwind; this allows the apparent wind to remain well ahead of the sail on the courses sailed, the fastest of which are reaches. To be avoided is heading too far downwind, where the apparent wind moves behind the sail and the speed drops below the true windspeed as the course trends from a broad reach to running square (dead down wind).\nUpwind.\nDepending on the craft sailed, the course made good into the wind may trend away from its closest point into the wind in order to allow the craft to sail at optimum speed. Bethwaite explains that high-speed sailing demands independent action of both the tiller and the mainsheet, whereby the person at the helm avoids responding to gusts and, instead, eased the mainsheet as needed, thus increasing the boat's velocity made good over the previous technique of pointing the craft more into the wind.\nOff the wind.\nAccording to Bethwaite, sailing off the true wind at speeds faster than the wind (with the apparent wind forward of the sail) demands a different reaction to gusts than previously employed. Whereas a traditional sailor might reflexively steer into the apparent wind in a gust, the correct response while sailing off wind, faster than the true wind speed is to veer away from the gust, heading more downwind. This has the doubly beneficial effect of relieving the heeling force of the gust and allowing the craft to sail yet faster off the wind."

        "text": "Frank \"Genny\" Gordon was a Welsh rugby union forward who played club rugby for Swansea Rugby Club. Although never capped for his country he is notable for captaining Swansea over two seasons, including the 1904/05 \"invincible\" season. Gordon also led Swansea against the first touring New Zealand team in 1906.\nRugby career.\nGordon joined Swansea in 1894, and spent several seasons playing for the \"all whites\" before succeeding Billy Bancroft as the captain of the first XV. He would captain Swansea over four seasons, when Swansea won the Welsh championship twice, including the 1904/05 \"invincible\" season when Swansea finished unbeaten by all club opposition. In 1904, with Gordon now into his third season as Swansea captain, he was listed as a replacement centre for the upcoming Wales encounter with Ireland, the final match of the 1904 Home Nations Championship, which happened to be played at Swansea. The present Welsh centre was Swansea team-mate and his vice-captain, Dan Rees. On the morning of the match Rees informed the Welsh Rugby Union that he was ineligible to play. This was seen by the Welsh selectors as an attempt by the Swansea club to manoeuvre their popular captain into the now empty slot in the Welsh team, to provide him with his first international cap in front of their own ground. The selectors acted angrily, and recalled semi-retired Wales captain Gwyn Nicholls to take the vacant position, rather than be dictated in their actions by the Swansea club. Despite Wales winning the match, Nicholls was treated poorly by the crowd who reportedly threw oranges and mud at him during the team photo. Whether through the perceived actions of his club or not, Gordon never represented Wales at international level.\nIn late 1905, The Original All Blacks had arrived in Wales as part of their first overseas tour. The last of their encounters in Wales was against Swansea, and except for a narrow defeat in a classic encounter against the National team, had defeated all their opponents, including England, Ireland and Scotland. Swansea was the last match to be played on British soil but few critics gave Swansea any hope of beating the All Blacks. Gordon lead his team in a narrow loss against New Zealand, the All Blacks scoring a dropped goal, while Swansea scored a single try from Fred Scrine. In 1905 that left the score 4–3 to New Zealand, by modern standards it would have seen Swansea win 5–3.\nAfter leaving club rugby, Gordon continued to support his old club, and in the encounter between Swansea and Australia during the Wallabies 1908-09 tour, Gordon was linesman during the match."

        "title": "Survivor Series (2009)",
        "text": "The 2009 Survivor Series was the 23rd annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on November 22, 2009, at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. It was the final Survivor Series to feature the ECW brand.\nThe card comprised six matches. There were two matches that were deemed the main events of the program. The first was the triple-threat match involving The Undertaker defending the World Heavyweight Championship successfully against both halves of the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions Chris Jericho and The Big Show. This was also followed by the other main event: another triple-threat match with John Cena defending the WWE Championship against Triple H and Shawn Michaels. The undercard matches included Batista versus Rey Mysterio in a singles match and three five-on-five elimination tag-team matches. The event received 225,000 pay-per-view buys, down from the previous year's event of 319,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every November by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1987. In what has become the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. The 2009 event was the 23rd event in the Survivor Series chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands. It was scheduled to be held on November 22, 2009, at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at Survivor Series involved professional wrestlers in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, WWE. Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and \"ECW\".\nOn the October 26 episode of \"Raw\" the show's guest hosts, Kyle Busch and Joey Logano scheduled the Raw brand's main event, in which John Cena was to defend the WWE Championship against both members of D-Generation X, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, in a Triple Threat match.\nAt Bragging Rights, a seven-on-seven tag team match pitting contingencies of Raw wrestlers against SmackDown wrestlers was held, with the winning team declared the dominant brand. Near the end of the match, Raw wrestler, and one-half of the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, Big Show, turned on his team, allowing the other half, Chris Jericho, to score the victory for SmackDown. The following night on \"Raw\", Big Show revealed that he turned on Team Raw as a favor from SmackDown general manager, Theodore Long, who in return would grant him a World Heavyweight Championship shot at Survivor Series against The Undertaker. On the October 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", both Jericho and Kane expressed a desire to face The Undertaker at Survivor Series instead of The Big Show. Long decided to change the World Heavyweight Championship match into a Triple Threat match, with the third person being the winner of a match between Jericho and Kane. Jericho won the match to earn his spot at Survivor Series.\nFollowing the fatal four-way match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Bragging Rights, two of the match's participants, Rey Mysterio and Batista, had a confrontation rooted in Batista's perception of Mysterio holding him back from winning the championship, promptly having the latter turn on his ally, and assault him. After failing to reason with him, a match between the two was scheduled on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\".\nFor the event, three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches were scheduled: The first pitted teams headed by WWE Intercontinental Champion John Morrison and WWE United States Champion The Miz against each other. Their partnership had ended when The Miz betrayed his partner, leading to verbal jabs via their Internet show, \"The Dirt Sheet\", as well as a match at Bragging Rights, in which The Miz was victorious. Morrison's team included Shelton Benjamin, Evan Bourne, Finlay, and Matt Hardy while The Miz enlisted Drew McIntyre, Sheamus, Jack Swagger, and Dolph Ziggler.\nThe second Survivor Series match pitted Randy Orton, who enlisted his protégés Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes (collectively known as The Legacy), as well as CM Punk and William Regal, against Kofi Kingston's team, which also included ECW Champion Christian, Mark Henry, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), and R-Truth. The conflict between Orton and Kingston rooted in their involvement in each other's matches over the previous weeks and Kingston defacing Orton's car.\nThe third Survivor Series match consisted of the women of the company. WWE Women's Champion Michelle McCool teamed with Alicia Fox, Jillian Hall, Layla, and Beth Phoenix; the opposing team, captained by Mickie James, included Kelly Kelly, Gail Kim, WWE Divas Champion Melina, and Eve Torres.\nEvent.\nPrior to Survivor Series airing live on pay-per-view, the fans in attendance were presented with an untelevised match pitting Santino Marella against Chavo Guerrero, which saw Marella get the pinfall victory.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe show commenced with Team Miz (The Miz, Drew McIntyre, Sheamus, Dolph Ziggler, and Jack Swagger) facing Team Morrison (John Morrison, Matt Hardy, Evan Bourne, Shelton Benjamin, and Finlay). Ziggler was eliminated by Bourne after an Air Bourne. Bourne was eliminated by McIntyre after a Future Shock. Finlay was eliminated by Sheamus after a Brogue Kick. Swagger was eliminated by Morrison after a Starship Pain. Benjamin was eliminated by The Miz after a Skull Crushing Finale. Hardy was eliminated by McIntyre after a Future Shock. Morrison was eliminated by Sheamus after a High Cross, leaving The Miz, McIntyre and Sheamus as the survivors. \nNext, Batista faced Rey Mysterio. The match started with Mysterio trying to hit quick attacks before Batista took Mysterio outside of the ring to the floor of the arena, which saw him throw his opponent into one of the posts of the ring. As the action returned to the ring, Batista went to execute his finishing move, the Batista Bomb, only to be stopped as his opponent escaped and threw him to the outside. With Batista outside again, Mysterio ran across the ring apron, and dove out at Batista with a seated senton. As the two once again made their way into the ring, Mysterio dropped Batista into the ropes as he executed the 619. As Mysterio went to pin his opponent, Batista evaded the attempt, leading to Mysterio ascending the top turnbuckle and attempted a frog splash; Batista blocked the attack, and performed the Batista Bomb onto his opponent three times, causing the referee to stop the match thus declaring him the winner via knockout. Batista then placed a chair in the ring and then performed a spinebuster to Rey onto the chair before the medical staff took him out on a stretcher.\nThe third match was a five-on-five Elimination Tag Team match between Team Kingston (Kofi Kingston, Montel Vontavious Porter, Mark Henry, R-Truth, and Christian) and Team Orton (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, CM Punk, and William Regal). Henry was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. R-Truth was eliminated by Punk after a Go To Sleep. Dibiase was eliminated by Christian after a Diving Sunset Flip. William Regal was eliminated by MVP after a Drive-By Kick. MVP was eliminated by Rhodes after Cross Rhodes. Rhodes was eliminated by Christian after a Killswitch. Christian was eliminated by Orton after an RKO. Punk was eliminated by Kingston with a Roll Up. Orton was eliminated by Kingston after Trouble in Paradise, leaving Kingston as the sole survivor.\nMain event matches.\nThe fourth match was a triple-threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship between World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker, Chris Jericho, and Big Show. During the match, Jericho and Big Show double-teamed The Undertaker. The Undertaker managed to remove Big Show from the ring and began to focus on Chris Jericho. Jericho countered The Undertaker's Old School rope walk and turned it into a superplex, giving him a brief advantage where he was able to apply the Walls of Jericho to The Undertaker. At this point Big Show returned to the ring and attacked Jericho with a chokeslam, freeing The Undertaker from the hold, but his attempt to do the same to The Undertaker was countered by a DDT. Jericho attempted a pin on both men but was thrown from the ring by Big Show. He retrieved the World Heavyweight Championship belt, which he attempted to use against The Undertaker but only hit Big Show with the belt. The Undertaker attempted a Last Ride on Jericho but Jericho struck The Undertaker's head with it. Jericho's failed attempt to mimic the Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker allowed enough distraction for Big Show to enter and punch The Undertaker in the face, leading to a pinfall attempt exchange between Jericho and Big Show on The Undertaker. When Jericho tried to retaliate for having his pinfall broken by Big Show, Big Show knocked him out but during his attempt to chokeslam The Undertaker, it was reversed into a Hell's Gate and The Undertaker scored a submission victory to retain the championship.\nThe fifth match was a five-on-five elimination tag team match between Team Mickie (Mickie James, Kelly Kelly, Melina, Gail Kim, and Eve Torres) and Team Michelle (Michelle McCool, Jillian Hall, Beth Phoenix, Layla, and Alicia Fox). Layla was eliminated by Kelly Kelly after a K2. Kim was eliminated by McCool after a Faith Breaker. Hall was eliminated by Eve after a Diving Sunset Flip. Eve was eliminated by Phoenix after a Glam Slam. Kelly was eliminated by Phoenix after a Glam Slam. Phoenix was eliminated by James with a Crucifix. Fox was eliminated by James after a Thesz Press. McCool was eliminated by Melina after a Last Call, leaving James and Melina as the survivors.\nThe final match was a triple-threat match for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H and Shawn Michaels. In a show of solidarity, Triple H and Michaels entered together as D-Generation X. Right after the match began, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music on Triple H, sending him outside the ring for several minutes. During this time Michaels fought Cena ably until he attempted to send Cena through the broadcast table. At this point Cena reversed but was interrupted by a recovered Triple H. But, instead of saving Michaels, he put him through a broadcast table with a Spinebuster. Triple H then took command of the match and continued to fight Cena. Cena's attempt at an Attitude Adjustment left him open to an attack by Shawn Michaels, who had revived from going through the table. Michaels and Triple H then battled one another for a period. Cena revived but was only met with a flying forearm smash from Michaels after missing a diving leg drop, who was promptly tossed outside by Triple H. Cena applied his signature submission, the STF, to Triple H but Michaels intervened and applied a crossface to break the hold. Eventually Cena was able to put Shawn Michaels in the STF, but Michaels forced a rope break. While recovering from the STF, Michaels executed Sweet Chin Music on both Cena and Triple H, causing Triple H to collapse onto Cena in a pinning predicament. A short burst of offense from Michaels and Triple H allowed Cena to get the final advantage, finishing the match by throwing Michaels onto Triple H with the Attitude Adjustment and pinning Triple H to retain the title.\nReception.\nSurvivor Series received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. 411maina praised the event, giving it a rating of 7.5 out of 10, with the triple threat main event match being rated 4.5 stars out of 5, the highest rated match from the event.\nAftermath.\nAfter John Cena retained the WWE Championship, a 'Breakthrough battle royale' was scheduled by Raw guest host Jesse Ventura to determine the next number-one contender. The concept being that every participant was to be a superstar who had not previously won a world championship. Sheamus won the match and later on attacked Cena and slammed him through a table, Ventura who had instigated the attack decided that Cena would defend the championship in a Tables match.\nBatista, whose actions sidelined Rey Mysterio for the next few weeks, later became the number one contender for The Undertaker's World Heavyweight Championship. After a few weeks of repeatedly attacking the champion, a Chairs match for the title was scheduled.\nThe 2009 Survivor Series was the last Survivor Series to include the ECW brand, as well as the ECW Championship, as the brand was disbanded in February 2010, deactivating the championship along with it.\nThe Survivor Series chronology was originally set to end with this 2009 event when during a press conference held on February 11, 2010, WWE Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Vince McMahon announced that WWE would drop the Survivor Series name and rebrand the event. However, following public outcry and several different fan petitions, the name was later reinstated, and in June 2010, WWE started to release tickets for the 2010 event."

        "text": "Richard Edwin Miller (born September 4, 1951) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. Since the 1980s, he has worked as an instructor, coach, and manager in Minor League Baseball.\nPlaying career.\nMiller spent his playing career in the New York Mets organization. He graduated from Lebanon Catholic High School and West Chester State College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in health and physical education. He was the Mets' sixth pick in the 1973 Major League Baseball draft. As a player, he stood tall, weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed. While he never played Major League Baseball, he reached the highest level of the New York farm system, spending 2½ seasons with the Triple-A Tidewater Tides of the International League from 1976 to 1978. In 1977, Miller led the team in hitting with a .284 batting average. During his eight-year minor league career, Miller batted .258 with 28 home runs.\nCoaching career.\nMiller was a player-coach for the Jackson Mets of the Texas League in 1979–1980, then turned his hand to full-time coaching, scouting and managing in the Mets' system. After a stint as a manager in Short Season-A and Class A ball, he spent 13 seasons as the Mets' roving minor league outfield and baserunning instructor. During his last three seasons with the Mets (2001–2003), he also served as assistant field coordinator. After 31 years with the Mets, he joined the Rochester Red Wings, the Minnesota Twins' Triple-A affiliate, as a coach in 2004. On April 21, 2005, he took over as interim manager when Wings' skipper Phil Roof took a leave of absence to be with his wife, who was battling cancer. Rochester went 69–62 under Miller's guidance the rest of the season. He returned to his former post as a Rochester coach until the 2008 season, when he was promoted to roving outfield, baserunning and bunting instructor for the Twins' Double-A and Triple-A affiliates. He began the baseball season as the hitting coach with the Twins' Single-A Midwest League affiliate, the Beloit Snappers, and was promoted to the same job with Rochester in July 2009.\nIn November 2009, Miller was named roving minor league outfield and baserunning coordinator by the Toronto Blue Jays. In August 2011, Miller was asked to step in as acting manager for the Vancouver Canadians, the Class A short-season affiliate of the Blue Jays, when the previous skipper was forced to take a leave of absence. Miller managed Vancouver to the 2011 Northwest League championship. In 2013, Miller was promoted to Senior Roving Instructor and in 2014 to Senior Advisor in the Blue Jays' minor-league system. On January 19, 2017, it was announced that Miller would return to managing the Canadians. On September 2, 2017, Miller was named the Northwest League's Manager of the Year after managing the Canadians to a Northwest League championship. Despite the championship and accolades, the Blue Jays organization released Miller on September 19.\nPersonal.\nIn 1989 Miller was inducted into the West Chester College Baseball Hall of Fame, which has since become the West Chester University Sports Hall of Fame; 1993 brought Miller's induction into the Central Pennsylvania Chapter of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Kentucky Derby Trophy",
        "text": "The Kentucky Derby Trophy is a set of four trophies that are awarded to the winning connections of America's most famous race: the grade one $3,000,000 Kentucky Derby. The owner receives a gold trophy while the trainer, the jockey and the breeder win a silver half size replica of the main gold trophy. The trophy itself has been run for since the 50th running of the Kentucky Derby in 1924. Churchill Downs Race Course of Louisville, Kentucky has annually presented a gold trophy to the winning owner of the famed \"Run for the Roses.\"\nEarly history.\nThere is no record whether a trophy was presented to the winner of the first Derby in 1875. There is evidence that trophy presentations were sporadically made between 1876 and 1924. In 1924, Matt Winn, who was the president of Churchill Downs at the time commissioned a standard design from artist George L. Graff for the 1925 50th \"Golden Anniversary\" of the Derby.\nDesign changes over time.\nOutside of the jeweled embellishments that were added to note special Derby anniversaries in 1949 (75th), 1974 (100th), and 1999 (125th), only one change has been made to the original design. For the 125th Kentucky Derby in 1999, Churchill Downs officials decided to defer to racing lore and change the direction of the decorative horseshoe.\nThe horseshoe, fashioned from 18-karat gold, had pointed downward on each of the trophies since 1924. To commemorate Derby 125 the change was made and the horseshoe was turned 180 degrees so that its ends pointed up. The trophy now annually incorporates the horseshoe with the ends pointing up. Racing superstition decrees that if the horseshoe is turned down all the luck will run out.\nDimensions and manufacture.\nThe trophy was supplied by Lemon &amp; Son, a Louisville jeweller (and the oldest retail business in Louisville) from 1924 until 1999. From 1975 onwards, the trophy has been manufactured by the New England Sterling company, located in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.\nThe trophy, which is topped by an 18-karat gold horse and rider, includes horseshoe shaped handles, is 22 inches tall and weighs 56 ounces, excluding its jade base. Most of it is 14-karat gold; some components are 14-karat green gold.\nTo complete the trophy by April, construction begins during the fall of the previous year; the completed trophy takes approximately 2000 hours of labor. Typically 29 parts are combined into 19 components which comprise the trophy. Various construction techniques are used, including casting (the horse and rider that top the trophy), stamping and metal spinning.\nThe trophy is believed to be the only solid gold trophy that is annually awarded the winner of a major American sporting event. As of 2008, its material raw value was $90,000.\nPresentations of trophy.\nEach year there are three separate presentations of the trophy. The first presentation of the gold Kentucky Derby Trophy is when it is officially presented to Churchill Downs race course on the last Saturday of April escorted by the Kentucky Army National Guard soldiers in between races on the undercard of the Derby Trial Stakes on opening day of the spring meet each year.\nThe second presentation is the one that is most familiar to the public on the first Saturday of May. It is when the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Chairman of Churchill Downs Incorporated awards the trophies to the winning connections about ten minutes after the race is declared official on NBC network TV.\nThe third and final presentation of the trophies is on \"Alumni Day\" on the Saturday of June following the Belmont Stakes, exactly six weeks after the race. The winning owner, trainer, jockey and breeder are all invited back to receive the trophies they earned earlier but have since been engraved with precise information engraved on each award. Churchill celebrates its third largest draw at the gate when the trophies are presented on \"Stephen Foster\" day. That day includes two opportunities for the public to meet winning alumni of the Kentucky Derby. The first has many former winning jockeys hold an autograph session. The second has the winning connections participating in a news conference and trophy presentation in between races on the undercard of the Stephen Foster Handicap, which is a grade one race for older horses at the Derby distance of one mile and a quarter.\n\"Run for the Roses\".\nThe use of roses was first established as part of the Derby celebration when they were presented to all the ladies attending a fashionable Louisville Derby party in 1883. The roses were such a sensation, that the president of Churchill Downs, Colonel Lewis Clark, adopted the rose as the race's official flower. The rose garland now synonymous with the Kentucky Derby first appeared in the 1896 when the winner, Ben Brush, received a floral arrangement of white and pink roses.\nIn 1904 the red rose became the official flower of the Kentucky Derby. The tradition was strengthened when, in 1925, New York sports columnist Bill Corum, later the president of Churchill Downs, dubbed the Kentucky Derby the \"Run for the Roses.\" The garland as it exists today was first introduced in 1932 for the 58th running won by Burgoo King.\nComposition and construction of Garland.\nEach year, a garland of more than 400 red roses is sewn into a green satin backing with the seal of the Commonwealth on one end and the Churchill Downs twin spires and number of the running on the other. Each garland is also adorned with a \"Crown\" of roses, green fern and ribbon. The \"Crown,\" a single rose pointing upward in the center of the garland, symbolizes the struggle and heart necessary to reach the winners' circle.\nEach year the Governor and other dignitaries present the winning jockey with a bouquet of 60 long stemmed roses wrapped in ten yards of ribbon.\nFor several years, owners of the Derby winner also received a silk replica of the garland, but since Grindstone's 1996 victory, the actual garland has made the trip to Danville, Kentucky to be freeze-dried. Some owners have even gone as far as to have a flower dipped in silver. A silver dipped flower from the garland of Gato del Sol, the 1982 winner, is on display in the Kentucky Derby Museum.\nThe Kroger Company has been the official florist of the Kentucky Derby since 1987. After taking over the duties from the Kingsley Walker florist, Kroger began constructing the prestigious garland in one of its local stores for the public to view on Derby Eve. The preservation of the garland and crowds of spectators watching its construction are a testament to the prestige and mystique of the Garland of Roses."

        "title": "Breeders' Cup trophies",
        "text": "The Breeders’ Cup Trophy is an authentic and totally faithful bronze reproduction of the Torrie horse. The original was created in Florence, Italy by Giovanni da Bologna, around the late 1580s. Each year the Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships award to the winner of each of 14 races a garland of flowers draped over the withers of the winning horse and four Breeders' Cup Trophy presented to the connections of the winners.\nEarly history.\nThe horse is an ecorche, showing the muscles of the animal in detail. Its original purpose is unknown, but it may have been made as a study for the equestrian statue of Duke Cosimo I of Florence, cast in 1591. It has stood in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence since that date. The ecorche character gives the sculpture clarity and precision, combined with the grace and beauty of the living animal. This is evidence of a scientific as well as an artistic intention on the part of the artist and reveals the importance to him of the influence and example of Leonardo da Vinci. The most recent monumental equestrian sculpture in Florence, before that of Duke Cosimo I, had been Leonardo’s never-completed monument to Giangiacomo Trivulzio. The Torrie horse bears a close relationship to several drawings by Leonardo related to this project in the collection of Her Majesty the Queen at Windsor.\nOther artists, too, knew and learned from Leonardo’s study of the horse, but none came so close as Giovanni da Bologna to his vision of the beauty of the animal celebrated by art and science together. The original ecorche bronze horse of Giovanni da Bologna is part of the University of Edinburgh Fine Art Collection in Scotland. The Edinburgh horse was acquired by Sir James Erskine of Torrie from the Villa Mattei in Rome, Italy in 1803. He bequeathed it to the University of Edinburgh with the rest of his collection of old master paintings and bronzes, and it came into the possession of the university in 1836.\nCurrent History.\nThe Breeders’ Cup Trophy was cast from the original and was directly supervised and approved by the University of Edinburgh for the exclusive use of Breeders’ Cup Limited. The largest version of the trophy is permanently owned by the Breeders’ Cup Ltd, which displays it annually at the World Throughbred Championships venue. Replicas are presented to the owners of the winners of each of the Breeders’ Cup World Championships races every year. The breeders, trainers and jockeys of each winning horse also are presented with replicas of the Breeders’ Cup Trophy.\nIn 1984 equestrian sculptor Irene French of Dorset, England was commissioned to sculpt an 11 inch high replica of the ‘Torrie Horse’. She completed this commission in 6 weeks. It was then cast in bronze by the Morris Singer Bronze Foundry of Basingstoke, England. This became the trophy for the American Breeders Cup, awarded annually to the winners of each of the Breeders Races.\nThe Torrie bronze was thought to have been used to teach equine anatomy in the Middle Ages. It is said that the artist George Stubbs used the classic stance of the Torrie Horse to best display the muscles in his famous equine anatomical drawings.\nBlanket of Flowers.\nFollowing a precedent started almost one hundred years ago, many of this country's highly esteemed grade one races award of a blanket of flowers draped over the withers of the winning horse. In the Breeders' Cup all 14 division races are adorned with this time honored tradition.\nThe Official Flower Garland Provider of the Breeders’ Cup is Kroger Floral Design Center, located in Louisville, Kentucky, it creates each of the 14 Championship race garlands.\nThe official blanket of flower garland is made of the rare combinations of Beauty Asters, Golden Asters, Cremons and Catteleya Orchids, which are grown exclusively for the Breeders’ Cup. The Kroger Floral Design Center has created the garlands since 1988. They have silk replicas of the official Breeders’ Cup flower garland, at the Breeders’ Cup Racing Office at (859) 514-9422.\nEach blanket has two wide saddle bag ends in an elongated pentagon shape that are adorned with a large purple circle emboldened with the Breeders' Cup logo and an embroidered script with the name of the race that was just won. The blanket is narrowed in the middle at the neck for ease of display over the horse and is topped with a full bouquet of both color Chrysanthemums with other floral embellishments. The blanket is 96\" long from one end to the other."

        "title": "Americas Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The Americas Rugby Championship, often informally called the Americas' Six Nations, was an annual international rugby tournament between six North and South American nations: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the United States and Uruguay. Originally competed by various interlocking combinations of club, second-tier national and top national sides, the current (since 2016) international tournament has the top national sides competing (though Argentina, to date, sends its second-tier team). The current format provides these top national teams with additional test matches to be counted in the World Rugby Rankings.\nThe original Americas Rugby Championship (organised by World Rugby) was inaugurated in 2009, when varying combinations of national, regional and development teams from North and South America competed for the title. In 2015, it was announced that from 2016, the competition would re-form under the guidance of the Americas Rugby Association and the respective unions, to provide the six national sides with additional rankings tests annually. The updated format is based on the structure of the European Six Nations Championship, coinciding with each other in February and March of each year. Prior to this, the last competitive tournament to be held across the Sudamérica–RAN region had been the PARA Pan American Championship, which had ceased after its 2003 edition. World Rugby has granted all matches with test match status, with caps awarded for every match, though matches against the Argentina XV (rather than the top Argentina national squad) will not affect the World Rugby Rankings.\nHistory.\nFirst conception.\nOriginally formed in 2009 by World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Board) to replace the North America 4 Series, was created to give the newly formed Canadian regions more competitive matches against strong opposition from the second teams of the United States and Argentina. The winner of the inaugural Canadian Rugby Championship, BC Bears, went on to compete on the international stage, playing the winner of the international semi-final match between USA Select XV and Argentina Jaguars. The Argentina Jaguars defeated the BC Bears 35–11 in the final to capture the tournament's first title.\nSecond and third editions.\nIn 2010, the tournament was cut from 6 to 4 teams, scrapping the Canadian Division part of the tournament to create a solely international based tournament for development sides. The USA Select XV and Argentina Jaguars were joined by the second team from Tonga, and a Canada Selects side made up of the top players in the 2010 CRC season. Each team played each other once in a round-robin format, gaining 4 points for a win, with the team on the most points at the end winning the title.\nThe tournament returned in 2012, having not taken place in 2011 due to the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The tournament kept the same format as 2010, however the national side of Uruguay joined the tournament replacing Tonga A, though in 2014, Uruguay sent their second team Charrúas XV. Argentina Jaguars went on to win every tournament between 2012 and 2014.\nCurrent conception.\nThe tournament was not held in 2015 because of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In 2016, the tournament was relaunched and expanded to six teams with the inclusion of Brazil and Chile. Unlike the previous single-site tournament featuring lesser sides, the new tournament will be held in February and March, concurrently with the European Six Nations Championship.

He is a famous underwater filmmaker and director, with several televised specials. Catonsville Community College is just south of the Baltimore Beltway, and south of the city limits. Anne Arundel Community College had a competing team for several years. It was also played for a while at the YMCA pool in Severna Park, Arundel Olympic Swim Center pool in Annapolis, and briefly in a pool in Columbia and at Howard Community College. There weren't any players from Colombia, S. America for several years after the start of UW Rugby in the USA, although they did participate in the 1990s and had players on the men's team at 1999 and 2003 worlds and women's team at 2003 worlds. Voting representatives for the international CMAS rules changes were sent to the CMAS 1987 Underwater Rugby Worlds in Zurich, Switzerland, and to the worlds in 1991 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Boston started a team a couple of years later than Baltimore and Boston still plays both Underwater Rugby and more recently underwater hockey.\nAround the year 2000, UW Rugby events in the US were basically UWR Clinics on which players from different parts of the country met to play during a weekend and play on a potluck format. After fail attempts to put together a National team to go to the World Championships of 2007 in Italy and 2011 in Finland, the only active clubs in the US (East Haven Makos, New Jersey Hammerheads, and Boston Narwhals) decided to join efforts with their Canadian counterparts (CAMO, Club Liberation) and started a Local Competition called the North American Underwater Rugby Tournaments (NAT) to raise the level of the game in both countries as well as provide continuous competition throughout the years for both countries.\nWith the North American Tournaments (NAT) the competition and level of play started to grow the sport and additional teams began to appear and expand the NAT tournaments. New Clubs started in the DC area, Florida, and later Wisconsin and California.\nNAT tournaments also became attractive to clubs from other countries and participation especially from Colombian Clubs has been an additional motivation for local clubs.\nInternational competition.\nThe USA National Team has only been involved 5 times in CMAS world tournaments as described below.\n1999 CMAS World Championship - Essen Germany\nA combined team of players from Baltimore, Boston, and some Colombian immigrants went to the Worlds in 1999 in Germany \n2003 CMAS World Championship - Fredericia Denmark\nThe team for the 2003 World Championship was assembled with players from different states with a base pool set in Massachusetts\nand in 2003 to Fredericia, Denmark.

The competition featured a group stage and a knockout stage. Commentators did not give much weight to the competition as a guide for performance during the season proper, as injuries or club strategic policy ruled that many teams did not use their best players and often used experimental tactics. The Pre-Season Cup was removed from the 2009–10 A-League schedule in order to give the clubs more control over their own pre-season training.\nHistory.\n2005–2006.\nThe inaugural A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup was won by Central Coast Mariners after they beat the reigning NSL Champions, Perth Glory 1–0 in the grand final. The event was a huge success and attracted clubs to thoroughly prepare for their A-League endeavours.\nThe second edition of the Pre-Season Cup was used to enhance the A-League's profiles by playing pre-season games in regional centres including the , , Toowoomba, , Canberra, Wollongong, Port Macquarie, and . A new format allowed matches for: third, fifth and seventh place as well as a grand final. A trophy was given to the teams that finished first, second and third.

Sydney FC finished in third place.\n2007–2008.\nThe 2007 edition had an identical format as the 2006 edition, it was won by Adelaide United after they came back from 1–0 down to win the game 2–1, 9,606 spectators attended the grand final and just over 3,500 spectators attended the third place play-off where Brisbane Roar beat Central Coast Mariners 3–1 after the Roar received two red cards during the match.\n, Caloundra, , Mandurah and all hosted matches for the first time. The Format changed again, the third, fifth and seventh place matches were removed and the top team from each group played each other instead of the regular knockout format. Melbourne Victory won the last ever A-League Pre-Season Challenge Cup after beating Wellington Phoenix 8–7 in a penalty shoot-out after a 0–0 score at the end of extra time.\nFormat.\nIn the Pre-Season Cup, the teams were evenly placed into two groups. Each team played the others in the group once over three rounds.\nBeginning in 2006, an additional bonus round was then held, with each team playing a cross-over match with a team from a different group. In addition to the standard points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw), there were special bonus points on offer for the bonus round matches:\nThis format was edited for the 2007 competition. The bonus round was removed, and the bonus points system introduced into each of the first three rounds. All eight teams then entered a knock-out round, culminating in the final in late August."

        "text": " \nRugby union in Antigua and Barbuda is a minor but growing sport. They are currently unranked by World Rugby.\nGoverning body.\nAntigua and Barbuda's governing body is not a member of World Rugby or NACRA, although it does have some dealings with the latter.\nHistory.\nLike many small island groups, Antigua and Barbuda has a population problem. The main sport is cricket, and the national population is under 100,000.\nThe British first introduced the game to the islands, and for a number of years it was mainly played by expatriates. Now it has some uptake by the local population.\nGames against visiting ships, and touring sides are common, as well as against neighbouring Caribbean islands.\nAntigua competes in the Caribbean Rugby Championship, a tournament which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Bermuda, Martinique, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, and Guyana."

        "text": "The TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball team represents Texas Christian University, located in Fort Worth, Texas, in NCAA Division I men's basketball competition. Since 2016, the Horned Frogs have been led by TCU Lettermen's Hall of Fame member, head coach Jamie Dixon. TCU has competed in the Big 12 Conference since 2012, and previously competed in the Mountain West Conference (2005–2012), Conference USA (2001–2005), Western Athletic Conference (1996–2001) and Southwest Conference (1923–1996). The Horned Frogs play their home games on campus at Ed &amp; Rae Schollmaier Arena, formerly known as Daniel–Meyer Coliseum, which reopened in December 2015 after a $72 million renovation.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Horned Frogs began varsity intercollegiate competition in men's basketball in 1908, when the university was located in Waco, Texas. In their first recorded game, the Frogs faced then-cross-town rival Baylor in a 6–37 loss; the Frogs notched their first recorded program win that same season versus the Waco YMCA. TCU moved its campus from Waco to Fort Worth, Texas, after a fire destroyed the central Texas' school's main building in 1910. TCU competed as an independent and as part of the Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association until joining Southwest Conference competition for the 1923–24 season, where the Frogs won their first-ever SWC game in a January 9, 1924, game at Rice University. During the early, independent and TIAA years, TCU was led by at least six different coaches from 1908 through 1923, and played five or fewer games or did not field teams in 7 of those 15 seasons.\n1920s–1970s Southwest Conference era.\nThe Horned Frogs were led into the Southwest Conference in 1923 by a new basketball and football coach, Fort Worth native Matty Bell. Bell transformed the program, accruing a 71–41 (49–30 SWC) record over his six seasons at TCU and leading the Horned Frogs to second, third and fourth-place finishes during his tenure. Bell was succeeded by Francis Schmidt, who left the Arkansas Razorbacks to coach TCU basketball and football. On the gridiron, Schmidt led the Frogs to their first SWC title and the gridiron in 1932, and on the hardwood, Schmidt led the Frogs to a combined 72–24 (41–19 SWC) record over five seasons and Southwest Conference championships in 1931 and 1934. The 1931 SWC championship was the Frogs' first league title in men's basketball. Schmidt departed Fort Worth after five seasons to become the head football coach at Ohio State.\nCoach Schmidt's departure after the 1934 SWC championship season was followed by a 16-year drought for TCU basketball. TCU football coach Dutch Meyer fared far better leading the Frogs' football team, where he claimed two national championships, in 1935 and 1938, and three SWC football titles over his 19-year football-coaching tenure, than he did in his three seasons at the helm of TCU basketball. Meyer's basketball record from 1934 through 1937 totaled on 10–37 (5–31 SWC). Meyer was replaced by former TCU basketball and football player Mike Brumbelow, who had two SWC wins over the following four seasons, with an overall record of 22–64 (2–46 SWC). Brumbelow was quickly replaced by Hub McQuillan, who led the Frogs to middle-of-the-league finishes in the first 5 of his 7 years as head coach of TCU basketball.\nBuster Brannon, a former TCU player under Francis Scmidt, led Horned Frogs basketball for nearly two decades, from 1948 through 1967. Brannon amassed a 205–259 (104–144 SWC) record over 19 seasons and led the Frogs to four Southwest Conference championships in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1959, and the program's first three NCAA tournament appearances in 1952, 1953 and 1959. Brannon's recorded faded in the 1960s, when the Frogs finished near the bottom of the league almost every year until Brannon's retirement from coaching in 1967. The Brannon era saw the opening of Daniel–Meyer Coliseum (now Schollmaier Arena) in 1961. Johnny Swaim, a former player for Brannon, coached the Frogs from 1967 through 1977. Swaim led the Frogs to Southwest Conference titles and the NCAA tournament in 1967, his first season at the helm, and in 1971. The Frogs' 1967 NCAA tournament appearance saw the Frogs' first-ever tournament win and the program's only appearance in what is now known as the Elite Eight. Swaim abruptly retired from coaching after the 1977 season, remaining in Fort Worth as a businessman until his death in 1995. After Swaim's retirement, Tim Somerville led the Frogs for the following two seasons, notching only a 10–43 (3–29 SWC) record.\nJamie Dixon era.\nOn March 21, 2016, TCU hired Pitt head coach and former Horned Frogs' letterman Jamie Dixon as the Frogs' next head basketball coach. Prior to his return to Fort Worth as the 22nd head coach of TCU basketball, Dixon spent 13 years as the head coach at Pitt, won four national coach of the year awards, and ranked as the 9th winningest, active Division I head coach. Dixon's impact at TCU was immediate, where in his first season he landed Jaylen Fisher, the highest-rated recruit in TCU history, led the Frogs to their best conference record and finish, best overall record, and first postseason tournament since joining the Big 12 in 2012, and knocked off the No. 1 ranked Kansas Jayhawks in the 2017 Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City–marking the program's first-ever win over a #1 ranked team. The Horned Frogs won the 2017 NIT Championship on March 30, to cap off Dixon's first season with a 24–15 record. The Horned Frogs qualified as an at-large bid for the 2018 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, snapping a 20-year drought.\nTCU made the NCAA tournament in 2022. They defeated Seton Hall 69–42 in the first round winning an NCAA tournament game for the first time in 35 years.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe Horned Frogs have appeared in 11 NCAA tournaments. Their combined record is 7–11.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition.\"\nNIT.\nThe Horned Frogs have appeared in eight National Invitation Tournaments (NIT). Their combined record is 17–7. They were NIT champions in 2017.\nCBI.\nThe Horned Frogs have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI). Their record is 1–1.\nRetired numbers.\nTCU has retired five numbers."

        "text": "The San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team is the men's college basketball program that represents San Diego State University. The Aztecs compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the Mountain West Conference (MW). The team plays their home games at Viejas Arena.\nThe Aztecs have been to sixteen NCAA Division I tournaments since joining NCAA Division I in 1969, last appearing in the tournament in 2024. In the 2023 NCAA tournament, they reached the Final Four for the first time in program history, losing to UConn in the championship game. In the Mountain West Conference, the Aztecs have won seven tournament championships and nine regular season titles.\nNotable alumni include NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn, who played both basketball and baseball for the Aztecs.\nTeam history.\nThe Aztecs first began play during the 1921–22 basketball season. The team played that season, as well as the next three, as part of the Southern California Junior College Conference due to proximity to other schools, despite the fact that that SDSU (then known as San Diego Normal School) was not a junior college itself. The Aztecs joined the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) in 1926 following a season as an independent, and competed in the NAIA until 1956, when they transitioned to the newly founded NCAA Division II. They competed in six NAIA Men's Basketball Championships. Finishing as runners up in 1939 and in 1940, the Aztecs finally prevailed and won the 1941 NAIA Division I men's basketball tournament. After competing in NCAA Division II from 1956 until 1969 they became an NCAA Division I school in the fall of 1969. The Aztecs moved from the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA), which is now known as the Big West Conference, to the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 1978. In 1999, the Aztecs left the WAC and became a charter member of the Mountain West Conference. Prior to entering the Mountain West, the team had been to three NCAA Division I men's basketball tournaments. During their time in the MWC, the Aztecs have won several conference championships and have been to nine NCAA tournaments and four NIT tournaments. In the 2010–11 season, the Aztecs were ranked as high as 4th in the nation and won their first ever games in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen. Following the 2013–14 season, the team reached its second Sweet Sixteen. In the 2019–20 season, the Aztecs finished with a 30–2 record for their best winning percentage in team history. The team spent seven straight weeks in the top 5 of both the AP Top 25 and Coaches Poll, finishing the season at #6 in both polls. The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was cancelled at the end of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2022–2023 season, the Aztecs reached their third Sweet Sixteen, first Elite Eight with a win over #1 Alabama, and first Final Four. The win over Creighton on March 26 in the South Region Final gave them their first Region championship in program history. On April 1, they became the first team from the Mountain West Conference to reach the National Championship after defeating FAU 72–71 on a buzzer-beating shot by point guard Lamont Butler. In the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game, the Aztecs were defeated by the University of Connecticut Huskies by a score of 59–76.\nRivalries.\nThe Aztecs have three rivalries, the UNLV Rebels, the USD Toreros, and the BYU Cougars. The rivalry with the Rebels was especially fierce between the years 2010–2013, however the rivalry has cooled down significantly due to the one-sided nature of the affair. San Diego State has won 22 of 24 games against UNLV from 2014 to 2024. The USD Toreros are the Aztecs' crosstown rivals and play them near-annually in the City Championship. The Aztecs' rivalry with the BYU Cougars has been partially dormant since 2011, when the Cougars left the MWC for the WCC. The teams still play occasionally in non-conference games.\nFacilities.\nViejas Arena.\nViejas Arena (officially Viejas Arena at Aztec Bowl) is a multi-purpose arena located in San Diego, California on the campus of San Diego State University. The arena opened in 1997 and seats 12,414 for basketball and up to 12,845 for concerts.\nViejas Arena is the home of the San Diego State Aztecs men's and women's basketball teams. The arena also hosts the San Diego Mojo of the Pro Volleyball Federation. The arena features an \"open-air\" concourse design that allows fans to experience breaks, concessions, and event activities for games, concerts, and other events outdoors.\nPrior to the opening of the arena, men's basketball played its home games primarily at Peterson Gymnasium (located across the street from Viejas Arena and the current home to the Aztec women's volleyball team), and, for more than 30 years, played on-and-off at the San Diego Sports Arena.\nJeff Jacobs JAM Center.\nIn 2015, the San Diego State Athletics Department opened an on-campus state-of-the-art practice facility, The Jeff Jacobs JAM Center, for the Aztec men's basketball and women's basketball teams.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I tournament results.\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament 16 times, with a combined record of 13–16. They have reached the Sweet Sixteen four times, in 2011, 2014, 2023, and 2024; in 2023 they reached the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and the National Championship, all for the first time. Additionally, at 30–2 and ranked in the Top 10 they were considered a virtual lock for the 2020 NCAA Tournament, which was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1978 edition with the present seeding format beginning the following year.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) six times, with a combined record of 8–6.\nNCAA Division II tournament results.\nThe Aztecs appeared in the NCAA Division II tournament three times, with a combined record of 5–3.\nNAIA tournament results.\nThe Aztecs have appeared in the NAIA tournament five times. Their combined record is 15–4. They were NAIA national champions in 1941.\nRetired jerseys.\nOn January 16, 2020, the Aztecs announced that they would be retiring former small forward Kawhi Leonard's number 15 jersey on February 1, 2020. Following Leonard's jersey retirement, some confusion circulated regarding statements that Leonard was the first player in Aztecs history to have his jersey retired, as the school ceremoniously retired former power forward and center Michael Cage's number 44 jersey in 1984.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Aztecs announced that they would be retiring three more jerseys in a \"Return to the Rafters\" ceremony on January 17, 2024. The players honored were Milton \"Milky\" Phelps, Judy Porter, and Michael Cage. This ceremony resolved the prior confusion regarding Cage's jersey retirement.\nTeam records.\nAll-time record vs. current MWC teams.\nOfficial record (including any NCAA imposed vacates and forfeits) against all current MWC opponents as of the completion of the 2022–2023 season:\nSingle Season Leaders (DI Era).\n(*) Lead conference\nNotable former players.\nSeveral former Aztec men's basketball players have gone on to play in the NBA, play in other professional basketball leagues, or achieve significant notability outside of basketball."

Although playing in only one international, it was part of the 1900 Wales Home Nations Championship winning season, making Dobson a Triple Crown winning player.\nRugby career.\nDobson's family moved to Wales from Scotland shortly before his birth in 1873, his brother Dobson having been born in Caithness just two years prior. Dobson found work as a young man as a coal trimmer in Cardiff Docks, a typical hard-working manual job that was popular in Welsh rugby clubs in their forward players. Dobson saw his brother join Cardiff Rugby Club followed by national selection for Wales in 1898. Dobson followed his brother with a place in the Cardiff team before he himself was chosen by the Welsh selectors to face Scotland, as part of the 1900 Home Nations Championship. Wales had won the opening match against England, and Dobson was brought in to replace Dick Hellings who was unavailable. Under the captaincy of Welsh sporting hero Billy Bancroft, Wales beat Scotland 12-3, setting up a potential Triple Crown season if they could beat Ireland in the final game. Although Dobson was replaced for the Irish match when Hellings returned, the Welsh win over Ireland on the 17 March made him a Triple Crown winning player in his one and only international match.\nDobson later went on to player for Rhondda team, Llwynypia, again following his brother. Dobson suffered from long periods of ill health dying in his late 40s in 1917.\nInternational matches played for Wales.\nWales"

        "title": "List of Cricket World Cup centuries",
        "text": "In cricket, a player is said to have completed a century when he scores 100 or more runs in a single innings. The Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organized by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), and is held once every four years. As of the latest 2023 tournament, a total of 236 centuries have been scored by 135 players from 16 different teams. Players from all the teams that have permanent ODI status have made centuries. In addition, players from four teams that have temporary ODI status have scored centuries. India have scored the most centuries (39), and have the most centurions (17).\nThe first century in the championship was scored by Dennis Amiss of England when he made 137 against India in the 1975 World Cup. The same day New Zealand's Glenn Turner scored 171* against East Africa. It remained the highest individual total over the next two editions until Indian cricketer Kapil Dev scored 175* against Zimbabwe in 1983. Following that, the record was broken successively by Viv Richards (181) in 1987, Gary Kirsten (188*) in 1996, Chris Gayle (215) and Martin Guptill (237*) both in 2015.\nIndia's Rohit Sharma holds the record for the highest number of centuries with seven, followed by India's Sachin Tendulkar and Australia's David Warner with six, and Australia's Ricky Ponting, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara and India's Virat Kohli with five. Tillakaratne Dilshan, Sourav Ganguly, Mahela Jayawardene, AB de Villiers, Mark Waugh, Quinton de Kock have four centuries each.\nRohit Sharma's five centuries in the 2019 tournament are the most by a player in a single tournament. Sangakkara scored four centuries in consecutive matches in the 2015 tournament. Quinton de Kock also scored four centuries in a single tournament (2023). Six players Waugh (1996), Ganguly (2003), Matthew Hayden (2007), Warner (2019), Rachin Ravindra and Virat Kohli (both 2023) have scored three centuries in a single tournament. In 1992, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe making his ODI debut in a World Cup scored a century. In the 2023 tournament, 40 centuries were scored, while the 1979 competition had just two centuries.\nSeven centuries have been scored in the finals; out of which six resulted in victories. Adam Gilchrist's 149 against Sri Lanka at the 2007 World Cup Final remains the highest individual score in a final; his 72-ball century is also the fastest in a final.\nThe fastest 100 in any World Cup was scored by Glenn Maxwell in 40 balls against the Netherlands on 25 October 2023. He also scored the World Cup fastest 200 in the same World Cup against Afghanistan on 7 November."

        "title": "Dan Rees (rugby)",
        "text": "Daniel Rees (born 1876) was a Wales international rugby union and rugby league centre who played club rugby for Swansea and Hull Kingston Rovers. Thomas was a twice Triple Crown winner, after representing Wales during the 1900 and 1905 Home Nations Championships. Later in his career he switched to professional rugby league, joining Hull Kingston Rovers. He was described as a \"speedy threequarter with a deceptive action\", and would have won more than his five international caps had he not been in competition with Gwyn Nicholls for the centre position.\nRugby union career.\nRees began his rugby career with Hafod Rovers, the same team that would produce fellow international teammate Dicky Owen, but switched to first-class side Swansea in 1897. Rees has a long career with Swansea, and from 1901 through to 1905 faced the Barbarians in each of their Easter tours. During the Barbarian encounters, Rees scored a try in each of the first four encounters, and three in the fifth. He later became the Swansea senior team's vice-captain during the 1904/05 \"invincible\" season.\nIt was while representing Swansea that Rees was first selected to represent Wales, brought into the team to face England in the opening game of the 1900 Home Nations Championship. Rees was not first choice for the match as in December 1899 the \"South Wales Daily News\" released the team sheet for the England vs. Wales encounter to be played on 6 January, with Gwyn Nicholls as centre. This was presumptuous as Nicholls had been part of the British Isles team that had recently toured Australia, and no contact had been made with Nicholls since the final game. On 31 December, a telegram was received stating that Nicholls would not be able to make the first Championship game, and the Welsh Rugby Union immediately responded with news that Rees would take his place at centre, winning his first cap alongside Swansea teammate George Davies. Wales won the game 13–3, with a try from Billy Trew on the wing, and a forwards try from Dick Hellings, both converted by captain Billy Bancroft who also scored a penalty goal. The \"Athletic News\" gave the Welsh victory to the pack, dismissing the threequarters, but \"The Sportsman\" wrote \"an exposition of the three quarter back game was given which must have satisfied the great Mr Arthur Gould himself\". The Thursday after the match, Nicholls arrived back in Britain and was immediately selected for the Welsh team to face Scotland. Despite a victory and some good reviews, Rees lost his place to Nicholls, despite Nicholls having not played a competitive game since the previous August. Some commentators believe that Nicholls played due to worries over his future selection caused by the good press articles the Swansea centres received. Wales won the next two games of the Championship without Rees, though his inclusion in the first game made him a member of the 1900 Triple Crown winning Welsh team.\nNicholls kept his place throughout the 1901 and 1902 Championships, but in December 1902, Nicholls broke his collarbone in an away game against Blackheath F.C. This ruled him out for the early games of the 1903 Home Nations Championship, and Rees was once again brought into the national team at threequarters. With injuries also sustained by Teddy Morgan and Willie Llewellyn, the Welsh threequarters was hastily constructed, with Swansea's Fred Jowett, and a recalled Tom Pearson taking the wings and Rees partnering the only surviving member of the 1902 team, Rhys Gabe. Despite losing their captain Pearson to a heavy tackle, the Welsh were rampant against a poor England in the opening match. Playing a man down, Jehoida Hodges was taken from the pack and placed on the wing to replace Pearson, and duly scored three tries in a 21–3 victory. Rees retained his partnership with Gabe for the next game of the tournament, played away at Inverlieth to Scotland. On a pitch which was waterlogged before kick-off and played under rain swept and windy conditions, Wales lost 6–0. The next game saw the reintroduction of Nicholls, back from injury and Rees once again lost his place to him.\nThe 1904 Championship began with Nicholls and Gabe at centre for Wales, but when Nicholls was unable to commit to the later stages of the tournament Charlie Pritchard was brought in rather than Rees. The 1905 Championship saw Rees reselected with Nicholls now apparently retired. Rees was back in partnership with Gabe at centre, and George Davies was now playing at full back. The Wales team first face England, who were demolished 25–0 by a vastly superior and more skilful Welsh team. The second game was against Scotland, which saw Rees' position as an amateur player queried by some sections of the Scottish sporting establishment. Wales won through two Willie Llewellyn tries, but this was to be Rees' final international. The final game of the tournament was a Triple Crown decider between Wales and Ireland, both having beaten Scotland and England. The match was played at Swansea's home ground, St. Helen's, and Rees had been selected to play, paired as he had been for the last two matches with Rhys Gabe. On the morning of the match, Rees informed the WRU that he was ineligible to play, which would have opened the way for nominated reserve, and Swansea's captain, Frank Gordon to gain his first international cap. The WRU reacted harshly to this, and reinstated Nicholls as they believed that Rees was following club orders to give their captain an international cap. The St Helen's crowd booed Nicholls and even pelted him with mud and oranges during the team photo, reacting badly to what was a snub to their captain and their team. Despite the ill feeling to Nicholls, Wales still won the game, making Rees, again in his absence, a Triple Crown winner for a second time.\nOn 21 October 1905, Rees drew his international career and any arguments of his amateur status to a close when he \"Went North\"; switching to professional rugby league team Hull Kingston Rovers. Rees was paid a signing on fee of £300 to join Hull Kingston Rovers, which was the largest fee to a Welsh player prior to World War I (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £110,300 in 2015).\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

A large field of 31 athletes from 15 countries was set to participate in the final, although Irishman Martin Fagan did not start the competition.\nKenenisa Bekele was the favourite before the race, having never lost a race over the distance and starting the race as the reigning Olympic and World champion, as well as the world record holder. Four-time major championship silver medallist Sileshi Sihine was another strong competitor, but he withdrew due to an injury and was replaced by Ethiopian team's reserve Imane Merga. Gebregziabher Gebremariam and Kenyans Moses Masai and Micah Kogo were other possible medallists, as well as the consistent Eritrean, Zersenay Tadese.\nTadese sprinted to lead the race at the start but he was soon overtaken by Nicholas Kemboi, who led until the 4000-metre mark. Tadese and Masai picked up the pace and the Eritrean fronted the fastest group of runners from 5000 metres onwards. After a kilometre further on, a group of four runners (Tadese, Masai, Bekele and Kogo) were clearly leading the race as the other competitors trailed off. Tadese continued to lead and picked up the pace once again, at which point Kogo dropped off, shortly followed by Masai. Bekele continued to follow Tadese waiting, and on the last lap the reigning champion finally took the lead, sprinting away to win the gold medal in a Championship record time of 26:46.31. Tadese took the silver, with a run of 26:50.12, and Masai maintained his third position for the bronze.\nEver the strongest performer, Bekele remained undefeated to win his fourth consecutive 10,000 m at the World Championships, but it was second-placed Tadese's first medal at the World Championships. Moses Masai's bronze was his family's second of the competition, as his sister Linet Masai had won the Women's 10,000 metres two days earlier.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following world and championship records were as follows.\nThe following new Championship record was set during this competition.\nFinal.\nKey: CR = Championship record, DNF = Did not finish, DNS = Did not start, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best"

Yuliya Pechonkina was the only athlete to reach the podium twice in that period, having won the 2005 World Championships and won the silver at the same event two years later. With such a quick turnover, it was expected that new athletes would again be possible medallists, especially as Pechonkina and reigning champion Jana Pittman-Rawlinson had withdrawn prior to the competition.

Angela Moroșanu, Josanne Lucas were amongst the season's fastest hurdlers, but the gold and silver medallists from the Beijing Olympics, Melaine Walker and Sheena Tosta had not shown strong form.\nDemus and Moroşanu recorded the fastest times on the first day of the competition, which saw no surprise eliminations. Kaliese Spencer was the third fastest, making her seem a possible finalist. Reigning Olympic champion Walker was the fastest in the semi-finals, with Lucas the second fastest in a national record time. Spencer, winner of the second race, was initially disqualified but was reinstated upon review. Amaka Ogoegbunam, a Nigerian athlete, tested positive for metenolone (an anabolic steroid) after the semi-finals, becoming the second athlete of the competition to fail a drugs test after Jamel Chatbi.\nIn the final race, Demus and Walker started fastest, with Lucas and Spencer not far behind. Demus took the lead near the final stretch but took the last two hurdles badly, allowing Walker to pass her to take the gold medal. Walker's time of 52.42 s was a Championship record and North American record, and only 0.08 seconds away from Pechonkina's world record. Bronze medallist Lucas had improved her national record by a significant amount (0.78 seconds) and fourth placed Spencer had set a new personal best.\nWalker had won despite modest performances in the season prior to the competition, while Demus failed to match her world-leading time she had set at the Herculis meeting in Monaco. Walker's run, which capped an Olympic and World double, was the second fastest in the history of the event. Josanne Lucas had significantly improved over the course of a year, knocking two seconds off her personal best, demonstrating her potential as a future medallist.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 4 in each heat(Q) and the next 4 fastest(q) advance to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each semifinal (Q) and the next 2 fastest(q) advance to the final."

        "title": "Women's Baseball World Series",
        "text": "The Women's Baseball World Series was an international tournament in which originally national women's baseball teams from around the world competed, before being overtaken by the Women's Baseball World Cup in . It was sanctioned by the International Baseball Federation.\nHistory.\nCompetitive international women’s baseball began when Japan sent a nationally selected squad, sponsored by a sports drink company named Team Energen, to Florida to participate in the North American Women's Baseball League’s 1999 South Florida Diamond Classic.\nAt the 1999 South Florida Diamond Classic, Team Energen showed that they could play at the top level of women’s baseball. After a meeting between Japanese and American officials following the tournament, plans were initiated for a contest between a national women’s baseball team from the United States and Team Energen in Tokyo.\nIn May 2000, a United States national women's baseball team flew to Tokyo and played the first competitive international women's baseball game on May 1 in the Seibu Dome against a nationally selected Team Energen squad. The Japanese team defeated the US team in front of 3,000 enthusiastic fans. Organisers were impressed at the success of the game and decided to organise an annual competition called the Women's World Series to be held in the United States or Canada in the summer of 2001. After discussions over the summer with women’s baseball program organisers within the AWBF, Baseball Ontario, the Baseball Victoria (Australia) and the Baseball Federation of Japan plans were developed for the 2001 Women's World Series in Toronto.\nThe Toronto Blue Jays agreed that several games including the championship game of the 2001 Women’s World Series would be played in the Toronto SkyDome. This proved to be an irresistible venue for attracting Japanese and Australian teams to North America. Australia selected their national women's team from a tryout process woven into their women's first Australian women's national baseball championship. The Australian Baseball Federation selected and trained the team which entered the 2001 Women's World Series. Baseball Canada also selected and trained a women's national team in 2001. Canada dropped out of international competitions after a disappointing fourth-place finish and did not resume play until the 2004 Women's World Series in Uozu City, Japan.\nThe American Women’s Baseball Federation (AWBF) with the help of the Roy Hobbs Baseball organization selected and organized the 2001 United States team through tryouts held in several areas of the country. A team ranging in ages from 15-41 represented the United States well eventually winning the inaugural 2001 Women’s World Series.\nThe 2002 Women's World Series was played in St. Petersburg, Florida with Japan, Australia and the United States entering teams. In the gold medal game played at Tropicana Field following a Major League Baseball game Australia defeated Japan 7-4.\nThe 2003 Women’s World Series was hosted by Australia and was played August 25–30 on the Gold Coast in Queensland at the Australian Baseball Federation national training site, Palm Meadows Baseball Complex. Japan was to host the 2003 event originally, but the SARS virus closed that venue in June 2003. Teams from the United States, Australia and Japan accepted. Japan won the 2003 Women’s World Series defeating Australia 4-2.\nFollowing the 2003 Women’s World Series representatives from the three countries met to discuss whether the 2004 Women’s World Series would be rescheduled because of the newly sanctioned IBAF 2004 Women's Baseball World Cup. The three country representatives and the IBAF agreed to reschedule the event for July 16–23, 2004 as to honour commitments to the World Cup.\nEight teams played in the 2004 Women's World Series. This enormously successful event witnessed new teams from Korea, India, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei (Taiwan). In the final, Japan defeated the USA 14-4 in front of almost 10,000 spectators.\nIn 2005 and 2006, the World Series was a North American competition held in the Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex open to any women's teams, as it was overshadowed by the now more successful and internationally recognised World Cup."

Rotuma is a dependency of Fiji, although one with a distinctive culture and language more related to its neighbours in Tonga and Samoa.\nThe Fiji Rugby Football Union is the governing body of rugby union in Rotuma.\nHistory.\nRugby was introduced to Rotuma at the turn of the 20th century by sailors and New Zealand missionaries.\nIn 1910, a combined America Universities rugby team comprising mostly players from California, Stanford, and the University of Nevada went on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, as well as Fiji and Rotuma. The underdog American side upset both Rotorua RFC and Auckland RU, which came as a great surprise to the international rugby community.\nRugby Sevens has been a sport in the South Pacific Games since the late 1990s."
