        "title": "Rowing at the 1956 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1956 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Wendouree, Ballarat, Australia. The event was held from 23 to 27 November. There were 12 competitors from 12 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's single sculls Ivanov's first of his three consecutive Olympic titles. He was so thrilled when he was presented with his gold medal that he jumped up and down with joy-and dropped the medal into Lake Wendouree. He immediately dived into the lake to retrieve it, but could not find it. After the games were over he was given a replacement medal. Stuart Mackenzie took silver, making it the second consecutive Games with an Australian runner-up. American John B. Kelly Jr., after missing the finals in 1948 and 1952 by 0.4 seconds and 0.2 seconds respectively, reached the final and took the bronze medal this time.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThree of the 18 single scullers from the 1952 Games returned: bronze medalist Teodor Kocerka of Poland, fourth-place finisher Tony Fox of Great Britain, and sixth-place finisher (and 1948 fourth-place finisher) John B. Kelly Jr. of the United States. Kocerka, who had also won the European championships in 1955 and the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1955 and 1956, was the favorite. The challengers included 1956 European champion Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, 1953 European champion and 1954 Diamond Challenge winner Perica Vlašić of Yugoslavia, 1951 and 1953 Diamond Challenge winner Tony Fox of Great Britain, and Kelly.\nMexico made its debut in the event; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time. Great Britain made its 11th appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe competition dropped the second repechage after the semifinals, used in 1952. The tournament featured four rounds: quarterfinals, a repechage, semifinals, and a final.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were held on 23 November. The first two rowers in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while the others went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage round was held on 24 November, with three rowers for each repechage. The winner of the repechage is qualified for the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 26 November. The first two rowers in each semifinal advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final round of men's single sculls was held on 27 November."

        "title": "2014 FIFA World Cup marketing",
        "text": "The marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup includes sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilize the symbols and songs of the tournament.\nLogo.\nThe official logo of the competition is entitled \"Inspiration\", and was created by Brazilian agency \"Africa\". The design is based around a photograph of three victorious hands together raising the World Cup trophy and its yellow and green colouring is meant to represent Brazil warmly welcoming the world to their country. It was unveiled at a ceremony held during the 2010 World Cup in Johannesburg. The design was selected from the submissions of 25 Brazilian-based agencies invited to submit designs. Brazilian graphic designer Alexandre Wollner has criticised the design, suggesting that it resembles a facepalm, as well as the process through which it was chosen, which had a jury that excluded professional graphic designers.\nPoster.\nFIFA also commissioned an official poster that was unveiled in January 2013 by World Cup ambassadors Ronaldo, Bebeto, Zagallo, Amarildo, Carlos Alberto Torres and Marta, all of them World Champion footballers, in a ceremony in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe artwork for this poster, which was created by Karen Haidinger, from Brazilian agency Crama, features a map of the country made up from the outlines of football players' legs kicking a football. In addition, the poster provides detailed drawing depicting the Brazilian culture and other features of the Brazilian nation such as the Brazil's fauna and flora. The official slogan is \"All in One Rhythm\" (Portuguese: \"Juntos num só ritmo\") which is a registered Trademark.\nThe colorful poster represents the beauty and diversity of Brazil and, according to FIFA's General Secretary Jérôme Valcke, the artwork is a great example that Brazil is a capable and creative nation.\nMascot.\nThe \"tatu-bola\", an armadillo that defends itself from predators by rolling up into a ball, was chosen by FIFA in September 2012 as the official mascot from 47 designs created by six Brazilian agencies.\nThe then-unnamed mascot was first unveiled to the public during a segment of the Brazilian news show \"Fantástico\". An online public vote was used to determine the name in which three potential names were offered, with the winning name being announced on 25 November 2012: 1.7 million people (about 48%) voted for Fuleco, ahead of Zuzeco (31%) and Amijubi (21%). The name is a portmanteau of the words \"Futebol\" (\"Football\") and \"Ecologia\" (\"Ecology\").\nAs well as appearing throughout the tournament, Fuleco also featured on a global promotional tour of the FIFA World Cup Trophy that visited 88 countries between September 2013 and the start of the tournament.\nMerchandising.\nGlobo Marcas have been appointed the master licensee by FIFA for all retail products related to the 2014 World Cup. A wide range of products have been produced, with the best-selling being those related to the Fuleco mascot as well as the official match ball. The Caxirola, the officially recognised tournament instrument, a percussive instrument created by Brazilian musician Carlinhos Brown, can also be purchased, although its use is banned within stadiums in contrast to the prominent vuvuzela in 2010.\nAdditional related items include the now customary releases of an official video game (released by EA Sports for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms) and a sticker collection by Panini, which could also be collected in virtual form on FIFA's website.\nMusic.\nAn official song has been created for every World Cup finals since 1962. In January 2014, FIFA and Sony Music announced that the official song for the tournament will be \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte. A customized version of the song \"Dare (La La La)\" by Shakira, who provided the official song of the 2010 tournament, will be used as a secondary theme song. Sony also launched a global music contest – entitled 'SuperSong' – to select a song for the competition's official album, \"One Love, One Rhythm\". The contest allowed any person to submit a song via a website, with the winning entrant to be professionally recorded by the singer Ricky Martin. In February 2014, American Elijah King was chosen with the song \"Vida\". In March 2014, FIFA also announced the addition of an official anthem, selecting the song \"Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)\", recorded by Avicii, Carlos Santana, Wyclef Jean and Alexandre Pires.\nBall.\nAs part of the marketing for the competition, the Local Organising Committee and Adidas arranged a competition to name the match ball to be used in the competition. Adidas Brazuca was selected by a public vote organised with over one million Brazilian football fans voting. The name \"Brazuca\" was chosen with 77.8% of the vote. Two other voting options were given: \"Bossa Nova\" (14.6% of the vote) and \"Carnavalesca\" (7.6% of the vote).\nSponsorship.\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.\nFanhansa.\nIn the summer of 2014 (starting 16 May and thereby not just in response to the German victory) a part of the Lufthansa fleet was renamed “Fanhansa”. As a partner of the German Football Association, Lufthansa flew the national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.\nTicketing.\nFIFA forecasts a total of 3,334,524 tickets for the tournament. The majority of these are distributed to groups such as commercial affiliates, hospitality clients, media rights holders and VIPs. Approximately 1.1 million are to be sold directly to the general public (400,000 to Brazilian residents only, 700,000 overseas); for each individual match, 8% of the tickets are reserved for fans of a competing team.\nThe sale of tickets to the general public has been divided into three phases and handled via FIFA's website and nominated locations in each of the host cities. \nThere are four categories of tickets, with Category 4 tickets only being available to Brazilian residents. Discounted tickets are available to Brazilians aged over 60, students and those receiving Bolsa Família welfare. These, the cheapest of all tickets, were available for 30 Brazilian reals (roughly US$12.50), while the most expensive ticket of the competition on general sale is a Category 1 seat for the final that retails at US$990. In addition to individual tickets, \"venue specific tickets\", which give access to all matches staged in a host city (during the group stage and round of 16), and \"team ticket series\", which give access to all matches of a chosen team during the tournament, are also available.\nTickets first went on sale on 20 August 2013 with 2.3 million tickets requested during the first 24 hours. By the end of this first phase of sales in October 2013, over six million requests had been received from the general public. As demand exceeded supply, FIFA staged a random draw to allocate tickets with a total of 889,305 tickets being allocated. A further 220,000 tickets issued on a first come, first served basis sold out within seven hours of being placed on sale in November 2013.\nFollowing the final draw in December 2013, the second sales phase began and concluded the following month, attracting over 3.5 million applications. Any remaining tickets were then made available on a first-come, first-served basis from March 2014 onward and could also be purchased in person at designated FIFA ticketing centres. From 15 April 2014 all remaining tickets were made available on a first-come, first-served basis. Despite the two oversubscribed application periods, tickets still remained available for some group stage matches as the tournament began."

        "title": "List of 2018 FIFA World Cup controversies",
        "text": "As with the 2014 Winter Olympics, the choice of Russia as host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup was challenged. Controversial issues included the level of racism in Russian football and the discrimination against LGBT people in wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine also caused calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea and support of separatists in War in Donbas. The then FIFA President Sepp Blatter declined requests for the tournament to be moved.\nThe 2015 allegations and criminal investigations of corruption, including a Swiss inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, intensified the public discussion of the appropriateness of Russia as the World Cup venue. In late May 2015, Russia's president Vladimir Putin said that he viewed the corruption investigations as an attempt by the U.S. to oust Sepp Blatter from his post as punishment for his support of Russia as host for the 2018 World Cup.\nAllegations of corruption.\nThe English FA, which competed against Russia to host the tournament, was not satisfied by the 42 page summary released by FIFA, in November 2014, of the 350 page Garcia Report, which cleared both Russia and Qatar of corruption in the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FA Chairman Greg Dyke called for a re-investigation of the claims, while his predecessor David Bernstein called on all UEFA nations to boycott the two tournaments.\nReinhard Rauball, President of the Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL), called on UEFA to secede from FIFA unless the corruption investigation was released in full.\nAnatoly Vorobyov said \"We have enough disciplinary measures which are laid out in our regulations. On the other hand, perhaps they need to be used more strictly\".\nIn an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".\nMilitary conflict in Ukraine.\nCrimea.\nThe annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 led to several British and American politicians calling on FIFA to overturn its decision of hosting the 2018 World Cup in Russia — British Shadow Secretary of State for Health Andy Burnham said that football's governing body should reconsider, while two American Republican senators, Dan Coats and Mark Kirk, wrote a joint letter to FIFA president Sepp Blatter saying Russia should not only be prevented from hosting a World Cup but also be banned from participating in it, bringing up the precedent of Yugoslavia being banned from Euro '92 and the 1994 World Cup as course of action to be followed in this case and proclaiming equivalence between Russia hosting the Cup with the appeasement of the Nazis and Adolf Hitler in the 1930s before World War II. In March 2014 Blatter declined their request and responded by saying: \"The World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".\nDeployment of troops in Eastern Ukraine.\nFollowing several reports of direct military involvement of Russian troops in Eastern Ukraine, European diplomats revealed on 29 August 2014 that British Prime Minister David Cameron was working for Russia to be stripped of its hosting of the World Cup, as part of an extended sanctions package. Some days later it was revealed that this was on the list of proposals for extended EU sanctions against Russia. However, no immediate action was taken due to the fact that the proposal was made nearly four years before the tournament.\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17.\nIn July 2014, after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down, Western leaders blamed Russia and there were again calls for the tournament to be moved. Michael Fuchs, a parliamentarian in the German government, stated his belief that moving the tournament would have more impact than sanctions on Russia. The German FA (DFB) did not comment on the issue, although its Dutch counterpart (KNVB), representing the country with the most victims in the disaster, declared that such discussion should wait until the investigation of the accident. \nNick Clegg, the then–Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, also stated his belief that due to the crash Russia should be stripped of the World Cup. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, did not share this idea, but appreciated the concern. Sepp Blatter said that the tournament should be a \"force for good\".\nEvents after Russia winning to host the World Cup.\nRacism.\nAfter it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, Dr Rafał Pankowski, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums. In October 2013, after allegedly being racially abused by fans of the Russian club CSKA Moscow, Ivorian footballer Yaya Touré stated that black players might boycott the 2018 World Cup unless Russia tackles racism in football.\nOn 13 July 2014, when the next World Cup was handed to Russia, Russian President Vladimir Putin said: \"President Blatter puts a lot of personal effort into addressing social issues, and we hope that the preparations for the World Cup in Russia will also contribute to tasks, such as fighting drugs, racism and other challenges we face today\".\nIn March 2015, Anatoly Vorobyov, the general secretary of the Russian Football Union, said that \"not everything is going smoothly\" in the campaign to eliminate the \"virus\" of racism from Russian football before the tournament. Later that month, Vyacheslav Koloskov, a member of the Russian bid team and former Vice President of FIFA, said that too much is made of racism in Russia, and that monkey chanting is not racist.\nLGBT activism.\nIn response to discrimination against LGBT people in the country, a number of petitions circulated calling for FIFA to strip Russia of hosting rights. Thousands signed these petitions, including United States senators Mark Kirk and Dan Coats and gay rights activists Greg Louganis, Stephen Fry and George Takei.\nOn 14 June 2018 UK-based activist Peter Tatchell was detained in Moscow by local police while staging a protest against the treatment of LGBT individuals in Russia.\nBan on negative news reporting.\nRussia's interior ministry ordered police not to provide negative news to the media during the World Cup and instead report only of solved crime cases to project a more positive image of the country. Russian police was instructed not to publish information about conducted raids or results of investigations into the crimes such as robberies and murders.\nUK response, reception and the British media.\nUK news media had repeatedly warned English football fans travelling to Russia of potential hooligan violence, anti-British hostility and racist intimidation. English fans who have travelled have said they received a warm welcome after arriving in Russia. The \"Independent\" reported that \"Most of the English fans blamed the low attendance for a 2-1 win on what they described as alarmist press stories.\" Also Polish media reported on the friendly reception of Polish fans in Moscow and fears of repeated violence between Polish and Russian fans in Warsaw 2012 have not been met.\nEngland's failed attempt to stage the 2018 World Cup.\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" reported in June 2017 that the former Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge \"were at a meeting during which a vote-swapping deal between England and South Korea was discussed, according to an official report ... At one point officials discussed the possibility of arranging a meeting with the Queen for one FIFA representative whose vote could have helped England.\"\nSkripal poisoning and aftermath.\nOn 14 March 2018, following the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in the United Kingdom, the British government announced that all official visits to the World Cup were suspended. No ministers or members of the Royal Family will attend matches or other ceremonies. The participation of the England team would not be affected. On 21 March, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused the Russian government of planning to use its hosting of the World Cup for propaganda, comparing it to Nazi Germany's use of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin for such purposes. Contrarily, however, he added that it would be unfair to ban the British football teams from competing. Russia denied the accusations and denounced Johnson's statements as \"unacceptable and totally irresponsible\" and \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\".\nUnited States sanctions against Iran.\nAmerican company Nike stopped supplying Iran's FIFA World Cup squad members with football boots just days before their opening match in the World Cup due to the new United States sanctions against Iran. Iran team's head coach Carlos Queiroz criticized the decision.\nUse of Cossacks against protesters.\n\"The new Cossacks are part of a broader movement of armed Russian nationalism,\" said Nikolay Mitrokhin, a senior research fellow at the University of Eastern Finland. \"Most of them fought in the Donbas, and many of them took part in the occupation of Crimea. It would appear that the Kremlin is now thinking about using them in Moscow in the same way.\"\nDon Cossacks, the volunteer paramilitary soldiers from Southern Russia who fought in Donbas, during the Ukrainian conflict were redeployed this time by the Kremlin to counter protesters and will be used to counter protesters of the World Cup.\n\"The new Cossacks were figures of fun, with their strange paraphernalia and dubious claims of historical lineage. But in Vladimir Putin's third term, as the Kremlin looked to create a nationalist, conservative ideology, they became influential. They began to receive significant state funding and political support.\"\nDuring the World Cup.\nMexican homophobic chanting.\nDuring the Germany versus Mexico group stage match, Mexican fans chanted \"puto\" at German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer; \"puto\" is a homophobic slang for a male sex worker that Mexicans and other Latin American countries have frequently used to taunt opposing teams. The origins of the insults against Neuer have been attributed to an incorrect Spanish translation of his statement \"it would be good if a professional football player came out because it would help others to do the same\".\nThe FIFA disciplinary committee fined the Mexican Football Federation 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,400) for the homophobic chants. The Mexican Football Federation was earlier sanctioned 12 times including 10 fines for anti-gay slurs during its World Cup qualifying campaign. Mexico striker Javier Hernández posted on Instagram, \"To all Mexican fans in the stadiums, don't shout 'pu--'. Let's not risk another sanction.\"\nSwiss celebrations against Serbia.\nIn Switzerland's 2–1 win over Serbia, Swiss goalscorers Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka both celebrated their goals with the double-headed eagle gesture with their hands. The gesture can be interpreted as a symbol of Albanian nationalism and sometimes as symbol of the Greater Albania irredentist concept, and both Shaqiri and Xhaka are of Kosovar Albanian heritage. Kosovo, the former Serbian province that unilaterally declared independence in 2008, is a partially recognized country claimed by Serbia. Both Kosovar President Hashim Thaçi and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama shared their support for the celebration on social media, while it was called \"a disgrace\" by several Serbian newspapers. FIFA subsequently opened an investigation into the incident on 23 June. While some Serbian supporters booed the players, their general anger after the match was more directed at some debatable referee decisions rather than the goal celebrations.\nDuring the match some Serbian fans wore shirts with pictures of war criminal Ratko Mladić, while some fans reportedly chanted anti-Albanian slogans.\nOn 26 June 2018 Shaqiri and Xhaka were each fined 10,000 Swiss francs by FIFA for the celebrations, although a crowd funding start-up in Albania had already raised enough money to cover the fines. Reactions to the fines imposed were mixed, some Albanian and Kosovar fans said the fine would discourage players celebrating their identity, while some Serbian fans thought that the players in question should have been banned from playing.\nCroatian celebrations against Russia.\nCroatian goalscorer Domagoj Vida and Croatian team's coaching staff assistant Ognjen Vukojević celebrated Croatia's World Cup victory over Russia by shouting \"Glory to Ukraine!\", a slogan adopted by Ukrainian nationalists. FIFA's disciplinary code prohibits political, nationalist and racist slogans in any form. Vida, celebrating the victory with former Croatian international and current assistant coach, Ivica Olić, was also recorded saying \"Belgrade is on fire!\" in Croatian. However, Serbian media reported \"Belgrade\" refers to the name of a pub in Kyiv that Vida had frequented, not the capital of Serbia, and that the phrase was used to encourage the pub to have a party. Aleksandar Holiga, editor of Croatian website Telesport, has largely downplayed the incident saying \"I don't think Vida understood the full meaning and context of what he was saying. Both of them were just doing it because they are close to Dynamo Kiev. It's something that fans would chant\" and that \"politically, Croatia doesn't have a perfect relationship with Russia, but then who does in the rest of Europe?\" BBC reported that \"Ukrainians accused FIFA of siding with Russia and flooded the football body's Facebook page with declarations of \"Glory to Ukraine\".\" After victory over England on July 11 in an interview to Russia 24 Vida said, speaking Russian, that \"he was mistaken\" and \"apologized to Russian people\". Domagoj Vida received an official warning by FIFA and Ognjen Vukojević has been fined 15,000 Swiss francs and expelled from Croatian team's coaching staff by the Croatian Football Federation.\nGroup H fair play controversy.\nJapan and Senegal finished Group H with the same number of points, the same goal difference, the same number of goals scored and a 2–2 draw as their head-to-head record. Japan beat Senegal into second place based on their fair play record, as they had fewer yellow cards (four against six).\nThe last two matches were played simultaneously. When Colombia scored against Senegal to go 1–0 ahead in the 74th minute, Japan went into second ahead of Senegal on the fair play rule. During their last game against Poland, the Japanese team were made aware of their advantageous position with ten minutes left and decided to play a very conservative game. They passed to one another and kept the ball in their own box, seeking to avoid any bookings. They did not attempt to score, despite being one goal behind. Poland, for their part were happy to let them do this as they were already winning but had no chance of advancing into the next round. Some fans at the match booed the players.\nAfter the match the Japanese manager, Akira Nishino, said in an interview \"I am not too happy about this, but I forced my players to do what I said. It's the World Cup, and sometimes these things can't be avoided.\"\nHowever, there was widespread criticism from football figures throughout the world. Comparisons were made to the 1982 'Disgrace of Gijón'. Japanese social media users also criticised their own team. However, others defended the Japanese team and FIFA said it had no plans to drop the fair play rule, despite calls for it to do so.\nVAR controversies.\nFIFA officially approved the use of a Video assistant referee (VAR) for the 2018 FIFA World Cup during the FIFA Council meeting on 16 March 2018 in Bogotá. This tournament became the first competition to use VAR in full (at all matches and in all venues).\nAfter the introduction of VAR in the 2018 World Cup, FIFA deemed it a success. Nevertheless, the use (or lack of use) of VAR has been criticised. Independent assessments note that while most decisions were made correctly as a result of VAR, some were wrong despite VAR review and some decisions which were called incorrectly were not even reviewed. \"The Guardian\" concludes that VAR has been most effective for factual decisions such as offsides and mistaken identities, while subjective decisions such as penalties or the disciplining of players have fared much worse. Lack of clarity and consistency are two main areas of weakness.\nA problem in consistency at the World Cup 2018 was for example the different rulings in similar game situations, which could be explained by unclear interpretation of VAR rules. For instance, in the game between Portugal and Iran in the group stage, Iran got a penalty kick after a handball by Cedric Soares, while in the game between Nigeria and Argentina, Nigeria did not get this chance after Marcos Rojo headed the ball onto his own arm, even after the referee checked the VAR.\nAnother line of criticism has been targeted at the effectiveness of the system in achieving its goal. In the opinion of Scott Stinson from the National Post, VAR, like any other replay system, fails to correct human error and instead only adds to the controversies because human judgment is still necessary. Lack of transparency is another contentious point, as teams have no way to know which incidents were reviewed by the VAR team. At a press conference held after the group stage, FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina showed footage of the decision-making process accompanied with audio of the conversations between VAR officials and the referees. Asked if this audio could be made publicly available, as it is in rugby and cricket, Collina answered enthusiastically but cautioned that it might still be too early.\nOthers have pointed to the game-changing nature of VAR. Initial fears that using the system would lengthen the game considerably have not been confirmed, with every VAR review taking up an average of only 80 seconds. The dramatic increase in the number of penalties awarded at the 2018 World Cup has been attributed to VAR catching fouls which would otherwise have remained unpunished. Of the 169 goals scored in the tournament, 22 were from the spot (with 29 being awarded in total), beating the previous record of 17 set in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Jonathan Liew of \"The Independent\" compares the situation to the introduction of the Decision Review System in cricket and notes the changes it had on that sport, and suggests that it might lead to changes of a similar nature in football.\nSome have also pointed out that only red cards, goals, offsides and mistaken identities can be checked by VAR, while other judgements that might potentially lead to a goal cannot be checked. For example, in the 2018 FIFA World Cup final, Antoine Griezmann fell to the ground after a challenge by Marcelo Brozović. The referee awarded a free kick to France despite Croatia players protesting that Griezmann had dived. The free kick led to an own goal by Mario Mandžukić, accidentally diverting the ball into his own net. Later replays showed that Griezmann was already falling before Brozović made contact with him. Some users on social media called for the use of VAR, but VAR cannot check the incident due to the guidelines set for VAR.\nMany football fans also accuse VAR of favouring \"big teams\". During a 2–2 draw between Spain and Morocco, a challenge from Gerard Piqué did not result in a red card for the Spanish defender, nor did the referee check VAR on multiple possible penalty calls. Fans also claim that the corner kick that led to Iago Aspas's late equaliser was played on the wrong side. There was an uproar on social media after the Group B games, with many fans claiming that Iran and Morocco have been \"robbed\". Moroccan midfielder Younès Belhanda criticized VAR for only helping \"big teams\" as well. Goalkeeper Munir Mohand Mohamedi said Morocco also felt that Cristiano Ronaldo's winning goal in the second fixture should not be allowed as Pepe appeared to foul a defender. As he left the pitch, Morocco winger Nordin Amrabat also appeared to say that the VAR system was \"bullshit.\" Nigeria players were also furious at Rojo's \"clear handball\" not being called, despite the referee checking VAR. \"I don't understand how that was not a penalty,\" Mikel said. \"It was a clear handball. If you look at this game yesterday against Portugal, this was even worse. He [Rojo] had the ball and it hit his hand and it was open. Maybe the referee didn't want to give a second penalty,\" Mikel said. \"For us, we've seen the replay, it was a clear handball. He looked at the VAR, the ball hit the hand. I asked him for explanation, did the ball hit the hand? He said `Yes.' Why is it not a penalty? He did not know.\"\nDuring the World Cup final, Croatia winger Ivan Perišić's arm appeared to make contact with the ball. Some experts claimed that Perišić's arm deliberately moved towards the ball, as shown in slow-motion. However, some argue that it was a natural movement, and Perišić did not have enough time to react after Blaise Matuidi failed to head the ball. Some fans and experts argue that due to the fact that VAR is in slow-motion, it made Perišić's handball look bad.\nRussian pension reform.\nOn the opening day of the World Cup (14 June) the authorities of Russia announced the extremely unpopular pension reform presuming a substantial increase of the retirement age. Ordinary Russian citizens accused their government and president of trying to hide such information amid the euphoria of the tournament, i.e. to use the event as a cover. Alexei Navalny interpreted this reform as a “robbery of tens of millions of people”.\nSexism.\nLate in the tournament FIFA requested that television and photographic coverage of fans at matches should give less emphasis to attractive young women. One Russian fan shown several times in the telecast of the opening match turned out to be a glamour model. Getty Images apologised for publishing a gallery of \"the hottest fans at the World Cup\". There were reports of Russian women and female media personnel being harassed by male fans. A Brazilian reporter was commended for upbraiding a man who attempted to kiss her during a live broadcast. Patrice Evra was accused of patronising fellow player-turned-pundit Eni Aluko after applauding a point made by her during ITV's coverage.\nBurger King social media campaign.\nBurger King issued an apology for an insensitive advertisement that was launched on the Russian social media outlet VK, promising a payment of $47,000 plus a lifetime supply of Whoppers, for any Russian woman if they were to become pregnant with a child fathered by a World Cup player. The ad claimed the women should get \"the best football genes\" and \"ensure the success of the Russian team for generations to come\", following the trend of playing on sexist stereotypes that are seen often in Russian ads.\nRiots in France.\nViolence and riots erupted in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and across the country after the French World Cup victory. Two French football supporters died while celebrating."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1960 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Albano, Italy. The event was held from 30 August until 3 September. There were 13 competitors from 13 nations, with each nation limited to one boat in the event. The event was won by Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, the second man to successfully repeat as Olympic champion (after Australia's Bobby Pearce in 1928 and 1932). It was the third consecutive Soviet victory in the event, with Yuriy Tyukalov winning in 1952 before Ivanov's victories in 1956 and 1960. Ivanov would go on to win again in 1964, becoming the first man to win 3 gold medals in the event. The silver medal went to Achim Hill of the United Team of Germany, the first medal in the men's single sculls for the combined team and the first single sculls medal for any German rower since 1936. Teodor Kocerka of Poland took bronze. Ivanov and Kocerka were the fourth and fifth men to win multiple medals of any colour in the event, with Kocerka previously taking bronze in 1952. It was Kocerka's third straight final in the event, placing fourth between his two bronzes. Australia's three-Games podium streak ended when Stuart Mackenzie fell ill and could not compete.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThree of the 12 single scullers from the 1956 Games returned: gold medalist Vyacheslav Ivanov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher (and 1952 bronze medalist) Teodor Kocerka of Poland, and fifth-place finisher James Hill of New Zealand. The top two scullers in 1960 were Ivanov (defending Olympic champion and two-time reigning European champion) and Stuart Mackenzie of Australia (1956 silver medalist, 1957 and 1958 European champion, reigning British Empire and Commonwealth Games champion, and four-time consecutive Diamond Challenge Sculls winner—he would stretch that streak to 6 in 1961 and 1962). But Mackenzie became ill before the competition and did not compete, leaving Ivanov as the heavy favorite to repeat.\nFor the first time, no nations made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 12th appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nDespite having one more competitor than the 1956 Games, the 1960 format dropped a round. The competition now consisted of only three rounds: semifinals, a repechage, and a final. The six-boat final returned.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThree heats were held on 30 August. The winner of each heat directly advanced to finals, while the others went to the repechage round.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on 31 August. The winner of each repechage heat advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 3 September at 16:00."

At the European Championships in even years, the 20 best gymnasts from competition I of the previous year present their routines.\nControversies.\nAccording to Armenian sources, the organizers of the European Championships in Rhythmic Gymnastics in Baku asked the Belarusian group to not use the music of Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian, which was reported by head coach Irina Leparskaya at a press conference in Minsk. The group had been performing their 2 Ribbons + 3 Balls routine with Khachaturian's \"Sabre Dance\", but they had to change to different music two weeks before the start of the Championships event. Spokeswoman for the Ministry of Youth and Sports of Azerbaijan Samaya Mamedova said they did not interfere in any federation's music decisions:\nRegarding Belarus, we didn't ask them to abandon their music. This decision was taken by Belarus itself. This is another provocative piece of information spread by Armenians to tarnish Azerbaijan as organizer of the European Championships of Rhythmic Gymnastics.\nThe Belarusian group, usually medal contenders, finished 17th in the all-around and placed last with their 2 Ribbons + 3 Balls qualification score amongst 21 countries during the European Championships.

It owes its popular name to one illustration in the calendar, with people playing a game resembling that of golf. It is presumed to have been made for a Swiss patron as the book includes a miniature painting of St Boniface of Lausanne.\nDescription.\nThe extant folios of the \"Golf Book\" are decorated with 21 full-page miniatures and a number of smaller paintings. In its current state the book opens with a page belonging to the suffrages of the saints, which depicts a bishop, probably St Boniface of Lausanne. The next section (folios 2v–17v) features fragments of the Little Office of the Virgin illustrated with the cycle of the Passion of Christ. The main miniatures are influenced by a series of engravings of a Passion attributed to the Master of the Gardens of Love. \nThe last section (folios 18v–30r) features the calendar. The representation of each month covers two facing pages, with a full-page illustration on the left-hand page showing the occupations of the months. \nAt present, the extant folios of the book are in the wrong order; the suffrages of the saints and the Office of the Virgin are placed before the calendar."

Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after a loss. Bouts consisted of three rounds of three minutes each, with one-minute breaks between rounds. Punches scored only if the front of the glove made full contact with the front of the head or torso of the opponent. Five judges scored each bout; three of the judges had to signal a scoring punch within one second for the punch to score. The winner of the bout was the boxer who scored the most valid punches."

They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena, which has a capacity of 10,506. They were playing their 70th season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, and were led by eighth-year head coach Gregg Marshall. They finished the season 30–5, 17–1 in MVC play to win the regular season Missouri Valley championship. They advanced to the semifinals of the Missouri Valley tournament where they lost to Illinois State. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Indiana in the second round and Kansas in the third round before losing in the Sweet Sixteen to Notre Dame.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2013–14 season was arguably the greatest season in Wichita State's 108-year basketball history. After defeating Missouri State on March 1, 2014, Wichita State became the first Division I men's team ever to finish the regular season 31–0, the first team to finish 18–0 in conference play in the Missouri Valley Conference since the 1985–86 Bradley Braves, as well as the first to finish the regular season undefeated since Saint Joseph's in 2003–04. The team's 35–0 start is the best Division I start ever, beating the 1990–91 UNLV Runnin' Rebels who began the season 34–0 and the best Missouri Valley Conference start ever, beating the 1978–79 Indiana State Sycamores, who went 33–0 to start the season. They spent most of the season in the top 10 of both major polls, rising as high as #2 in late February. They continued their run by winning their first MVC tournament title since 1987, and were ranked second in both final major media polls—the highest final national ranking in school history.\nThey entered the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament undefeated at 34–0. The Shockers beat Cal Poly, 64–37 for their NCAA-record 35–game winning streak to start a season. Two days later, and playing their 5th and final straight game at St. Louis' Scottrade Center, Fred VanVleet's three-point attempt at the end-of-game buzzer against Kentucky bounced harmlessly off the rim, and so went their attempt to become the first men's team in 38 years to win the title undefeated. The Shockers finished with the third-most wins in Division I history, and the second-most for a school not in a power conference.\nDepartures.\nIn addition to the departing players, assistant Chris Jans left the Shockers immediately after the season to take the head coaching vacancy at Bowling Green.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Missouri Valley Conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| Missouri Valley tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#000; color:#FFC318;\"| "

        "text": "Joe \"Spanky\" McFarland (born May 24, 1954) is an American former college baseball coach who was the head coach of Northern Illinois (1991–1997) and James Madison (1998–2015). Under him, JMU appeared in three NCAA tournaments. A 1976 graduate of Hillsdale College, McFarland served as an assistant coach at several schools in the late 1970s and 1980s.\nPlaying career.\nA native of New Carlisle, Ohio, McFarland attended Tecumseh High School, where he played football, basketball, and baseball. He then played football and baseball at Michigan's Hillsdale College. After graduating in spring 1976, he spent training camp with the Canadian Football League's Calgary Stampeders before starting his coaching career the following year.\nCoaching career.\nJunior college and assistant coaching.\nMcFarland's first coaching position was an assistant job at Hillsdale in 1977. He next served as the head coach at Kellogg Community College, also in Michigan, from 1979 to 1980. His overall record at Kellogg was 33-13. McFarland then spent a decade as an assistant in the southeast, coaching at Appalachian State (1981), Florida State (1982), Georgia Tech (1983–1985), and South Florida (1986–1990).\nNorthern Illinois.\nMcFarland's first Division I head coaching job came at Northern Illinois (NIU) from 1991 to 1997. There, McFarland revived a program that had been cut in the early 1980s. He had a 146-211 record in seven seasons.\nAfter playing 1991 as an independent, NIU played in the Mid-Continent Conference from 1992 to 1994. The team finished in the bottom three of the conference in all three seasons, with its highest win total coming in 1994 (23-30). From 1995 to 1997, it played in the Horizon League and qualified for the conference tournament in each season. In 1995, it had its first above-.500 season under McFarland (29-27), finished second in the West Division, and placed third in the Horizon Tournament. The Huskies' Jesse Richardson was named the Horizon Player of the Year. In 1996, it won the Horizon Tournament but lost to Northeastern Illinois in the NCAA tournament play-in game.\nAt NIU, four of McFarland's players were selected in the MLB Draft, including 7th-round selection Chris Burt in 1994. Another of his players, Brian Schmack, went undrafted but later pitched in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers.\nJames Madison.\nAfter the 1997 season, McFarland left Northern Illinois to become the head coach at James Madison. He replaced Kevin Anderson, who had resigned following allegations that he overstated spending on team meals.\nThe Dukes' first winning season under McFarland came in 2000, his third season, when they went 37-22. After another 30-win season in 2001, the Dukes qualified for the NCAA tournament in 2002. After a 41-12 regular season in which they won the CAA's American Division and McFarland was named CAA Coach of the Year, they went 2-2 in the CAA Tournament. After receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the third seed in the Columbia Regional, they went 1-2, getting a win against VCU in an elimination game.\nAfter missing the CAA Tournament in 2004 and 2005, the Dukes went 38-21 in 2006 and won the CAA regular season title. They finished third in the CAA Tournament, however, and did not receive an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.\nMcFarland's best four-year stretch at James Madison came from 2008 to 2011. In this stretch, the Dukes had three 30-win seasons and a 40-win season. They won two CAA regular season titles (2010 and 2011) and appeared in two NCAA tournaments (2008 and 2011). In 2008, at the Raleigh Regional, the Dukes again went 1-2 with a win in the 0-1 game. In 2010, the team won the regular season title but lost in the tournament; McFarland was named the CAA's Co-Coach of the Year. In 2011, they reached the Chapel Hill Regional final in their deepest postseason run under McFarland.\nJames Madison had losing records in 2012, 2013, and 2014, finishing no higher than 6th in the CAA.\nAt James Madison, McFarland has had many major award winners and draftees. CAA award winners include Players of the Year Eddie Kim (2002 and 2003), Kellen Kulbacki (2006), and Jake Lowery (2011). Kulbacki was named a First-Team All-American in both 2006 and 2007. Between 1998 and 2014, 28 of his players have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. Rich Thompson, Dan Meyer, and Ryan Reid went on to appear in Major League Baseball.\nIn the fall of 2014, McFarland announced that he would retire after the 2015 season. That year, the Dukes finished 18-33 and missed the CAA Tournament.\nPersonal life.\nMcFarland's son, Ty, played for him at James Madison from 2011 to 2014. He was a 10th-round selection of the New York Yankees in the 2014 Major League Baseball Draft.\nIn 1990, McFarland wrote a book titled \"Coaching Pitchers\". It was re-published in 2003.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\nBelow is a table of McFarland's records as a collegiate head baseball coach."

        "text": "The Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) is the oldest active NCAA Division I ice hockey-only conference beginning in 1959–60, and based in Denver, Colorado. At the conclusion of each regular season, it holds the WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament to determine its conference champion(s), which it has done since the foundation of the conference.\nThe tournament has had many variations over the course of its history, starting with four teams and naming two regional champions. The modern format of the tournament, where only one champion was crowned, wasn't codified until 1981–82 after four teams left to join the CCHA and the NCAA began to offer automatic bids to the National tournament rather than inviting finals participants.\nDenver has won the most WCHA championships with 15. Murray Armstrong has won the most titles (10), all with Denver, and appeared in the second most title games. John MacInnes has appeared in the most title games (15) and won the second most, all with Michigan Tech. These numbers are, however, misleading as the WCHA had named two tournament champions for most of its first 22 years rather than offering a game(s) to decide a single champion, the era that both Armstrong and MacInnes coached in. Had this policy continued unabated Doug Woog would be tied with Armstrong for most titles as well as winning 5 consecutive (1990–1994) and appearing in 12 consecutive finals (1986–1997).\nChampions.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

Women's Tennis Association is the main organisation which runs female tennis.\nHistory.\nWomen's tennis is present from the first Olympic Games in 1900 in Paris and 1908 in London, but the women's doubles only appeared in 1920 at the Antwerp Games.\nOne of the first superstars of women's tennis is Suzanne Lenglen, who after six titles won at Wimbledon and the Internationaux de France left amateur tennis to achieve a first professional tour in North America in 1926–1927.\nHowever women's tennis did not really become established until the 1960s, and especially with the establishment of the Women's Tennis Association in the 1970s.\nFeatures of women's tennis.\nIn women's tennis matches the ball is usually played without effect (less than lift) and games tend to play more from the baseline; typing is generally less powerful than men. The game is made in a more tactical speed and anticipation. The service is also less powerful; it is relatively less important than for men. However, there has been a noted evolution in this field since the 1990s, women's tennis is improving and is growing more and more popular.\nControversy.\nWomen's tennis has been marked by several cases, including cases of sexual abuse by trainers. The world of women's tennis is sometimes described as \"homophobic\" and \"sexist\"."

Both Italy and Ukraine added two further gold medals, Arjola Trimi (200m freestyle S4) and Federico Morlacchi (200m freestyle S9) for Italy and Yelyzaveta Mereshko (50m freestyle S6) and Yevheniy Bohodayko (200m individual medley SM12). The day ended as it started with success for Great Britain with Stephanie Slater winning the 200m individual medley SM8. Britain finished as the day's most successful country with five golds in total, which also included a new European record for Andrew Mullen in the men's 50m butterfly S5.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who agreed to participate in the Championships and the requested number of athlete places for each."

        "title": "2014 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2014 NRL Grand Final was the concluding and premiership-deciding match of the 2014 NRL season. Played on the evening of Sunday 5 October 2014 at ANZ Stadium, the match was contested by the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. South Sydney won the match with a decisive 30 points to 6 victory, ending a 43-year premiership drought by claiming their 21st title. South Sydney forward Sam Burgess, who suffered a broken cheekbone from the game's opening tackle, was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the best player on ground.\nThe match was preceded by the 2014 National Youth Competition Grand Final and the 2014 NRL State Championship. British-American musician and songwriter Slash and American alternative rock band Train performed at the event as pre-match entertainment, and Simon Gleeson performed the Australian National anthem. The match was broadcast live throughout in Australia by the Nine Network.\nBackground.\nHistory.\nFounded in 1908, Souths had won more premierships—20—than any other club. However, they had not appeared in a Grand Final since 1971. Over the subsequent decades, the club had battled financial problems before being excluded from the National Rugby League competition ahead of the 2000 season due to a failure to meet the league's criteria for inclusion. After litigation and high-profile public campaigns, the club was readmitted into the competition for the 2002 season.\nFor Canterbury, founded in 1934, the Grand Final was the club's 18th. Their most recent Grand Final appearance was a 2012 defeat to Melbourne, with their last premiership coming in 2004 against the Sydney Roosters.\nThe clubs had met each other in just one previous Grand Final in 1967, with South Sydney prevailing 12-10.\n2014 season.\nSouth Sydney finished the regular season in third position, before defeating Manly and the Sydney Roosters in the finals series. Canterbury finished in seventh place, and made the grand final after successive sudden-death victories over Melbourne, Manly and Penrith.\nBoth sides had met each other twice during the course of the season, in rounds 7 and 25. The two teams were tied 1 apiece, with Canterbury winning the first encounter 15-14, and South Sydney winning the second encounter 21-14.\nTeams.\nBoth teams' first choice hookers were ruled out from playing in the week leading up to the Grand Final:\nMatch report.\nThe first half of the match was a low-scoring affair. There was only one try—to South Sydney's Alex Johnston—while Adam Reynolds kicked a penalty goal to give Souths a 6–0 half-time lead. Canterbury equalised ten minutes into the second half through a converted try to Tony Williams. George Burgess restored Souths' lead shortly thereafter, before further tries to Kirisome Auva'a, Reynolds and Greg Inglis in the final ten minutes of the match. The final score was Souths 30, Canterbury 6.\nSouths' Sam Burgess played the entire match, despite fracturing his cheekbone and eye socket in contact in the opening tackle with James Graham. He was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal, as the man of the match in the grand final. Souths player Dave Tyrrell was stretchered from the field after he was knocked out in the 68th minute following a head clash with Canterbury player James Graham.\nFullback Greg Inglis, who scored the final try of the game in the final minute of play, won his first valid premiership ring after previously featuring in the Melbourne Storm's 2007 and 2009 sides which had their premierships stripped from them due to salary cap breaches.\nEntertainment.\nFormer Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash performed \"Bent To Fly\" from \"World on Fire\", with the accompanying vocal track by Myles Kennedy being played over loudspeaker. The performance of the song was accompanied by a montage of the 2014 NRL season on ANZ Stadium's screens. Slash also performed the guitar riff from Guns N' Roses' \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", before closing the set with an improvised solo.\nTrain performed as the main act, playing \"Hey, Soul Sister\", \"Angel in Blue Jeans\", and \"Drops of Jupiter\".\nMatch Officials.\nShayne Hayne and Gerard Sutton were the match referees. It was Hayne's fourth grand final as he has officiated in the 2009, 2010 and 2013 grand finals. It was Sutton's first grand final as referee.\nSteve Carrol and Jason Walsh were the touch judges, and the video referees were Bernard Sutton and Luke Phillips. The standby referee was Ben Cummins and the standby touch judge was Brett Suttor.\nRecords.\nThe 2014 NRL Grand Final was the most-watched club game in the history of rugby league, with a five-city average television audience of 2.597 million, with a peak of 3.098 million viewers. Combined with 1.354 million regional viewers tuning in, the game had an average audience of 3.951 million viewers, and a national peak audience of 4.650 million viewers.\nThe crowd of 83,833 was the largest attendance at a sporting event at Stadium Australia since its 2001 reconfiguration.\nPost-match.\nSouths' premiership victory qualified them for the 2015 World Club Challenge, their first ever appearance in the end of year event, in which they beat St. Helens RFC 39-0 at Langtree Park."

        "title": "2017 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 2017 America's Cup was the 35th staging of the America's Cup yacht race. The challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, won by a score of 7 to 1 over the defender, Oracle Team USA. It was held on the Great Sound in Bermuda from June 17 to June 26. The races were conducted using hydrofoiling AC50 America's Cup Class yachts, which are slightly larger than the AC45F yachts used in the 2015–16 America's Cup World Series.\nIt was Oracle's second defence of the America's Cup, four years after its first successful defence. Emirates Team New Zealand defended the cup in the 36th America's Cup. The format was changed since the last Cup, to the current best-of-13.\nVenue.\nThe 2017 America's Cup course was on the Great Sound in Bermuda, the venue at the Royal Naval Dockyard.\nIn June 2014, media reported the venue of the 34th America's Cup, San Francisco, was no longer in consideration to host the 35th edition. San Diego, Chicago and Bermuda were listed as being still in the running. In July 2014, americascup.com reported that Chicago was dropped from the running, and finally on 2 December 2014, Bermuda was announced as the host of the 2017 America's Cup. The Premier of Bermuda, Michael Dunkley, welcomed the teams, sponsors, and spectators at a press conference in New York.\nThe financial package included in the bid by Bermuda was worth approximately US$77 million, including a $15 million sponsorship fee, $25 million for infrastructure improvements, $12 million operating costs and a $25 million guarantee against commercial sponsorships. Dr. Grant Gibbons, Bermuda's Minister for Economic Development, stated that the America's Cup had a possibility of generating revenue of up to US$250 million in Bermuda.\nSecurity arrangements at the Dockyard were assumed by HM's Royal Bermuda Regiment after termination of contract between the local security provider and the AC35.\nChallenger of Record.\nOn 1 October 2013, Australia's Hamilton Island Yacht Club was confirmed as the \"Challenger of Record\" for the 35th America's Cup, after submitting their paperwork only moments after the win by Oracle Team USA. The HIYC challenge was accepted by the Golden Gate Yacht Club, who was the Defender and Trustee of the America's Cup. Australian businessman Bob Oatley, founder of Rosemount and owner of famed super maxi yacht \"Wild Oats XI\", was confirmed to be the main financial backer of the Hamilton Island Yacht Club challenge.\nOn 19 July 2014 Russell Coutts, Director of the America's Cup Event Authority (ACEA), announced that the Hamilton Island Yacht club had withdrawn Team Australia from the 35th America's Cup. Team Australia claimed that the entry fee rules agreed to in the official protocol created too much risk due to the uncertainty of the then unknown venue and schedule of the event.\nThe Challenger of Record Committee (CORC) represents all of the challengers' interests and negotiates with Oracle over mutual concerns. Luna Rossa replaced HIYC as the challenger of record. In April 2015, Luna Rossa withdrew its challenge bid, pulling out of the 2017 America's Cup in protest at rule changes reducing the size of the boats.\nRule changes.\nOn 5 June 2014, it was announced that the regatta would be sailed in 62-foot-long (18.9 m) foiling catamarans, the AC62. The entry fee was $3 million. Each challenging team could build only one boat while Oracle Team USA could build two. A nationality rule was agreed, requiring 25 percent of the crew to be from the entry's country. This nationality rule had been lifted prior to the 2003 America's Cup. The rules specified the combined weight of the crew could not exceed 525 kg. The neutral International adjudicating yachting panel was dropped in favour of a three-man panel appointed by the defender.\nIn March 2015, the teams voted to reduce the size of the boats to the 45- to 50-foot range, leading to the withdrawal in protest of Luna Rossa. This in turn led to a joint statement from four teams attacking Team New Zealand which had supported Luna Rossa.\nTeams.\nThe America's Cup was contested by its defender Oracle Team USA, who represent the Golden Gate Yacht Club. The challenger was Emirates Team New Zealand, for Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, who had defeated the other four challengers to win the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Challenger Playoffs trophy.\nTechnical development.\nTeams were allowed to take one-design AC45s out of measurement by modifying crossbeams, wings and rudders, adding hydraulic systems, as well as produce a maximum of six custom daggerboards to test on the existing platform ahead of building their race boat. All teams took advantage of this opportunity: Oracle Racing modified three AC45s, selling their first development boat to SoftBank Team Japan as part of their technology-sharing agreement and subsequently conducted a two-boat testing program with their last two boats; Land Rover BAR modified three AC45s and conducted a two-boat testing program with their last two boats; Artemis Racing modified two AC45s and conducted a two-boat testing program with them. Groupama Team France, Luna Rossa and Emirates Team New Zealand modified one AC45 each. Luna Rossa later gifted their boat to Team New Zealand.\nThe winning Emirates Team New Zealand yacht design team, led by Technical Director Dan Bernasconi, also modified SL33 foiling wingsail catamarans to try new ideas for its race boat, in which they produced a number of distinct features absent from other boats in the fleet: two four-handed grinding pedestals on their development AC45 were replaced by four cycling stations; Peter Burling was the only helmsman to be relieved of daggerboard controls in order to focus on steering only; instead \"cyclor\" Blair Tuke undertook daggerboard deployment, trim and overall responsibility of pitch angle and ride height; Daggerboards were lengthier than those of other teams by virtue of a distinct dihedral bend in the middle of the hydrofoil tip.\nThe rise in foiling catamarans encouraged competing teams to enter into technical partnerships with companies specializing in aerospace technologies. Land Rover BAR allied with Red Bull Advanced Technologies, headed by ten-time Formula 1 World Constructor's Championship car designer Adrian Newey. Oracle Team USA entered a technical partnership with Airbus. Artemis Racing allied with high performance engineering giant Cosworth. Luna Rossa Challenge had partnered with Lenovo to analyze and predict race simulations, assisting in the design of their boat.\nQualifying events.\nThe America's Cup World Series was won by Land Rover BAR, earning two points to take into the 2017 Louis Vuitton America's Cup Qualifiers Round. The runner up was Oracle Team USA, earning one point to take into the Qualifiers Round.\nOracle Team USA won the 2017 Louis Vuitton America's Cup Qualifiers Round, earning one point to take into the 2017 America's Cup competition. Emirates Team New Zealand, Land Rover BAR, Artemis Racing and SoftBank Team Japan advanced from the 2017 Louis Vuitton America's Cup Qualifiers Round to the Challenger Playoffs Semi-finals, while Groupama Team France was eliminated from further competition.\nEmirates Team New Zealand eliminated Land Rover BAR in the 2017 Louis Vuitton America's Cup Challenger Playoffs Semi-finals, advancing to the Challenger Playoffs against Artemis Racing who had eliminated SoftBank Team Japan in the other semi-final.\nEmirates Team New Zealand won the 2017 Louis Vuitton America's Cup Challenger Playoffs Final against Artemis, 5–2, advancing to face Oracle Team USA in the 2017 America's Cup.\nCup Match.\nRaces were held from 17 June. The first team to seven points wins and becomes the Defender of the America's Cup. Due to Oracle Team USA's win in the America's Cup Qualifiers, Emirates Team New Zealand started the match with a score of −1.\nThe first race of the day is scheduled each time at 2:00 pm ADT. The race data were published on the official noticeboard."

        "title": "League Championship Series (esports)",
        "text": "The League Championship Series (LCS) is the top level of professional \"League of Legends\" in the United States and Canada. The esports league is run by Riot Games and has eight franchise teams. Each annual season of competition is divided into two splits, spring and summer, which conclude with a double-elimination tournament between the top teams. At the end of the season, the winner, runners-up and third-place team of the summer playoffs qualify for the annual \"League of Legends\" World Championship.\nEstablished in 2013, the league was initially split into two regions: the European League of Legends Championship Series (EU LCS) and the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). The NA LCS featured eight teams, which were determined via a promotion and relegation system. In 2015, the league expanded to ten teams. In 2018, the NA LCS shifted to a franchise system with ten permanent teams, which became eight after the 2023 season. Along with the new model, the league rebranded to simply the League of Legends Championship Series, aligning with the EU LCS's change to League of Legends European Championship, creating unique identities for major regions. The franchise era of the LCS has witnessed several team sales and rebranding efforts. The 2020 season introduced format changes and had to adapt to online play due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the LCS again rebranded to the League Championship Series. The 2023 season saw controversy with the LCS Players Association (LCSPA) threatening a player walkout over financial support for teams in the North American Challengers League (NACL).\nWith the exception of some touring events, all games of the LCS are played live at the Riot Games Arena in Los Angeles, California. In addition to a small studio audience, all games are streamed live on Twitch and YouTube.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early years.\nPrior to the formation of the North American League of Legends Championship series, \"League of Legends\" had a growing competitive scene, but a professional league was not a central component of Riot Games' initial business strategy. However, in 2011, professional organized league play became a prominent point of emphasis for Riot after the company hosted its inaugural championship tournament at DreamHack.\nOn August 6, 2012, Riot Games announced the formation of the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), a professional gaming league designed to provide support to teams from Europe, Asia, and the United States. The inaugural season of the LCS commenced on February 7, 2013, coinciding with the third season of professional play in \"League of Legends\". As such, it was designated as \"Season 3\". It was split two regional leagues: the European League of Legends Championship Series (EU LCS) and the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). Within these leagues, eight teams representing their respective regions engaged in regional competitions. The top teams in each region advanced to the League of Legends World Championship. The league was not profitable throughout its first season. At the end of 2013, Riot announced a Challenger league, later known as the League of Legends Challenger Series (CS). The league was established with the purpose of serving as a platform for developing talent and providing an opportunity for Challenger-level teams to participate in the LCS via a promotion and relegation system.\nHeading into the 2015 season, an expansion tournament was held in both Europe and North America that added two teams in each region, giving the LCS a total of 10 teams per region. Additionally, Riot introduced the concept of \"Championship points\", which teams would earn based on performance across both splits and playoffs in order to qualify for the World Championship. A new sale of sponsorship rule was instated for the 2015 season, prohibiting companies that facilitated sponsorships for LCS teams from also possessing the branding of those LCS teams. Notably, the GoodGame Agency held ownership of both Europe's Alliance and North America's Evil Geniuses while simultaneously managing sponsorships for both teams. Consequently, in compliance with this new regulation, these teams underwent rebranding, adopting the names Elements and Winterfox, respectively. Furthermore, Curse Inc. faced restrictions on sponsoring LCS team Team Curse, leading to a comprehensive merger of the entire esports organization under the banner of Team Liquid. The league's first female player, Maria \"Remilia\" Creveling, also joined the league in the 2015.\nOn May 8, 2016, Riot Games took a series of punitive actions against NA LCS teams Team Impulse and Renegades, along with Challenger Series team Team Dragon Knights. These actions effectively banned these teams from participating in any future sanctioned \"League of Legends\" contests due to several infractions, including neglecting player payments, mistreatment of players, and withholding information that would have rendered the teams ineligible for competition. In addition to these sanctions, it was found that, during trade requests between Renegades and Team Dragon Knights, both organizations provided misleading information to League officials regarding the independence of the two teams and the status of players and payments. The evidence indicated that some players continued to be compensated and housed by their former teams even after the trade had been completed. As a result of these actions, former Renegades owner Chris Badawi was permanently banned from participating in Riot-sanctioned leagues, and Christopher Mykles was banned from holding any Riot-sanctioned position within a competing organization for one year. The three teams were given until May 18 to sell all rights and legal claims to their LCS/CS berths.\nFranchised era.\nIn June 2017, Riot Games announced that the NA LCS would shift from a promotion and relegation system to franchised league with ten permanent teams beginning in 2018. Each of the ten teams would have guaranteed spots, which would encourage owners to make substantial investments, including the creation of training facilities and improvements in coaching, scouting, and player well-being. Each team was also mandated to maintain an academy squad for emerging talent development. Riot Games also raised the minimum salary for players to , with an average annual income for League pros around $150,000. Additionally, a players' association was established to offer financial, legal, and career-building support to players. The buy-in price for the league was $10million for existing League of Legends teams, who had previously participated in the League Championship Series or Challenger Series. New teams would be subject to an additional $3million, which was distributed to the teams that were replaced in the league. The NA LCS received over 100 applications for a spot in the league. The ten franchised teams were announced in November 2017. Among the already established teams in the NA LCS were FlyQuest, Team SoloMid, Cloud9, Counter Logic Gaming, Echo Fox, and Team Liquid, while the newly admitted teams to the NA LCS were 100 Thieves, Clutch Gaming, Golden Guardians, and OpTic Gaming.\nIn December 2018, the NA LCS re-branded its name to simply the LCS and with updated their logo. The change aligned with the EU LCS's name change to the \"League of Legends\" European Championship (LEC) earlier that year. Following the EU LCS's transition to LEC, all major regions in the competitive world of \"League of Legends\" had a unique name, logo, and brand identities. The changes were made to establish distinct identities for every regions.\nThe league saw several franchise sales in 2019. In June, the parent company of Dignitas announced that they had partnered with the Houston Rockets to acquire Clutch Gaming for reportedly over $30million, marking the first-ever merger involving a \"League of Legends\" franchise in the LCS. In May, Riot Games issued a 60-day ultimatum to Echo Fox, demanding the removal of co-founder and shareholder Amit Raizada from their cap table. This action was prompted after it was revealed that Raizada had used racist language directed at former Echo Fox CEO Jace Hall during an email exchange, and in another email, Raizada also made threats against the family of Echo Fox's owner, Rick Fox. When Echo Fox failed to comply with Riot's directive, Riot Games forced Echo Fox to sell its LCS franchise. After a failed attempt to sell the franchise to Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, Echo Fox agreed to allow Riot Games to handle the sale process. In September, Evil Geniuses acquired Echo Fox's LCS slot for $33million.\nBefore the 2020 season, the league implemented a series of format changes. The league removed the \"Championship points\" system introduced in 2015. In this new structure, victories during the spring splits would solely serve to qualify a team for the Mid-Season Invitational. The regional qualifying tournament, which was used to advance teams to the World Championship, was also eliminated. Instead, the top three teams from the summer split playoffs earned the right to advance to the World Championship. The LCS also implemented a revised schedule for the 2020 season, featuring broadcasts of matches on Monday evenings called \"Monday Night League\" in addition to their regularly scheduled Saturday and Sunday broadcasts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, LCS commissioner Chris Greeley announced the suspension of the 2020 season on March 13, 2020, with no definite timeframe for resumption. Subsequently, the LCS resumed its competitions through online play, starting on April 18, 2020. The league decided to discontinue Monday Night League in May 2020 due to low viewership. Instead, the league extended its broadcasts to include Friday evenings.\nThe league rebranded from the \"League of Legends\" Championship Series into the League Championship Series ahead of the 2021 season. A new logo and two new mottos were introduced: \"Made by many\" and \"All for the game.\" The LCS expanded the 2021 season to include a preseason tournament called the LCS Lock-In. The league also merged the regular season of the spring and summer splits. Team's spring split regular season record qualified them for the LCS Mid-Season Showdown, which itself would be a qualifier for the Mid-Season Invitational. Regular season records over both spring and summer would be used to seed teams into the LCS Championship tournament, with the top three teams from there moving on to the World Championship. For the 2022 season, the league returned to the previous regular season format, with each split's records being confined to that specific split.\nIn the 2023 season, another franchise sale took place when NRG Esports acquired Counter Logic Gaming, assuming control of its LCS slot. The 2023 season also saw the LCS Players Association (LCSPA) threaten a player walkout. In May of that year, Riot Games announced plans to remove the requirement for LCS teams to financially support North American Challengers League (NACL) teams, citing the need to provide more operational and financial flexibility to LCS teams. This change, effective from the 2023 Summer Split, led most LCS franchises to disband their development rosters. In response, the LCSPA threatened a player walkout to support affected individuals, viewing Riot's decision as unprecedented and contradictory to earlier assurances. The LCSPA demanded Riot's support for the NACL, citing successful second-tier leagues in other regions. The walkout vote passed, resulting in the first major esports league strike. Riot responded by delaying the start to the 2023 Summer Split, stipulating that if both parties could not reach an agreement within the designated two-week period, the Summer Split would be cancelled and no teams would be eligible for the 2023 World Championship. A deal was reached on June 8, establishing a new NACL business model with a 50/50 revenue split, governance improvements, minimum player notice and severance requirements, and healthcare insurance reinforcement. Riot also provided a one-time payment to Rally Cry, the NACL organizer, and emphasized cost-sharing between LCS and NACL teams.\nPrior to the start of the 2024 season, TSM sold their franchise slot to Shopify Rebellion. In addition, on November 19, 2023, Golden Guardians and Evil Geniuses exited the LCS, as their third-party administrator agreement with Riot Games was terminated. With not enough time to fill the two vacancies, the league announced that they would continue with eight teams for the 2024 season.\nFormat.\nThe LCS features eight North American teams competing in two seasonal splits, spring and summer. The regular season of each split adopts a double round-robin format with best-of-one matches. In the spring split, the top six regular season teams progress to the double-elimination spring playoffs, with the top four in the upper bracket and the bottom two in the lower bracket, with the spring playoffs champions and runner-up qualifying as the North American representatives for the Mid-Season Invitational. In the summer split prior to 2024, the top eight regular season teams moved on to the double-elimination LCS Playoffs, with the top six in the upper bracket and the bottom two in the lower bracket, with the winner of the LCS Playoffs winning the LCS title. The top three teams from the LCS Playoffs qualify as the North American representatives for the World Championship, with the 4th place team participating in the Worlds Qualifying Series against the 4th place team from the LEC Season Finals for an additional spot. For both split playoffs, all matches were played in a best-of-five format.\nChampionships.\n Denotes a team that is no longer in the LCS\nMedia coverage.\nThe LCS primarily connects with its audience through online streaming via dedicated channels on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. Games in 2013 drew in more that 1.7million unique viewers. While regular season viewership on Twitch approached nearly 300,000 peak viewers in 2014 at times, recent years leading up to 2023 saw a consistent decline. For instance, the 2023 LCS Summer finals reached a peak of just over 223,000 viewers, marking a decrease of around 50,000 viewers compared to the previous split's finals and a decrease of 150,000 viewers compared to the summer 2022 finals.\nRiot Games CEO Brandon Beck stated in 2012 that there were no immediate plans to try to bring the LCS to traditional TV, and news coverage of the regular season were generally limited to dedicated electronic sports news sites. In December 2016, Riot announced that it had reached a deal with BAMTech (a spin-off of MLB Advanced Media) to serve as the exclusive distributor of LCS broadcasts through 2023. BAMTech would have paid $50 million per-year under the contract, and split advertising revenue with Riot. However, internal complications arose after The Walt Disney Company acquired BAMTech, and the contract never actually took effect. As a substitute, Riot entered into an agreement to non-exclusively carry its broadcasts on ESPN+ instead, in addition to existing outlets such as Twitch."

        "title": "Seaton Carew Golf Club",
        "text": "Seaton Carew Golf Club has held golf games since 1874, making it the tenth oldest golf club in England. The club is based in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool on the North Sea coast, north of the River Tees in North East England. When it was first established it was the only golf club in the English counties of Yorkshire and Durham, hence its original name Durham &amp; Yorkshire Golf Club; the club's crest and badge retain the emblems of both the Archbishop of Durham and The Archbishop of York.\nAs more golf clubs were coming into being, particularly in North Yorkshire and County Durham, the club's Committee and members decided the old title was no longer apt and the name of Seaton Carew Golf Club was adopted in 1887. By the end of the 19th century the links was already regarded as one of the English game's premier golfing locations. In the 1888-89 Golfing Annual the course was described as being of \"sandy nature, covered with soft velvet turf that springs under one's foot and rejuvenates the aged\".\nand was also featured in \"The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News\" which even in 1894 stated that \"in the opinion of visitors that between St Andrews and Sandwich there are few better rounds on the east coast than Seaton Carew.\" The course has since featured in many golf publications and reviews. Seaton Carew is frequently referred to as one of the most challenging links golf courses anywhere in the British Isles. In 2009 the \"Sky News\" reporter Graeme Bailey said of his visit to these links \"Seaton Carew has everything any golfer would want, but most importantly it is a course which could stand shoulder to shoulder with anything in Britain.\"\nSeaton Carew Golf Club was one of the earliest golf clubs in the UK to elect a lady captain of the club. Jane Longhorn was appointed in December 2010 and served the club as captain throughout 2011. Longhorn was the first lady to be elected as captain in the club's 136-year history.\nFounding of the Club.\nThis golf club's existence is due mainly to one man, its founder Dr. Duncan McCuaig, a surgeon from Edinburgh who moved down to Middlesbrough shortly after qualifying at Edinburgh University. McCuaig was a good golfer, winning the gold medal at St Andrews on two occasions, in 1867 and 1869.\nOn transferring to Middlesbrough to further his medical career Dr. McCuaig was dismayed to find there was nowhere throughout County Durham or North Yorkshire to exercise his talent for the game. So he set about finding a suitable place to play. As luck would have it he came across a strip of pasture land, known locally as The Snooks at Seaton Carew, where local people grazed their livestock. It was close to the mouth of the River Tees, running between the north shore and Seaton Carew village, and was owned by Lord Eldon. With Eldon's permission, and after some resistance from the stint holders whose sheep and cattle roamed the area, Dr. McCuaig and a few like-minded colleagues were able to rent a piece of land on which they established the Durham &amp; Yorkshire Golf Club. The contribution that Dr. McCuaig made to the creation of Seaton Carew Golf Club is recalled every time anyone plays the Seaton links, a challenging par 3 surrounded by eight bunkers is named \"The Doctor\" in his memory. \nSeaton Carew Golf Club historical records and archive.\nThe club has an extensive historical archive as a result of the association of the Bunting family. Today this archive is held by Mr. Edward Bunting whose grandfather, C.J. Bunting and father, G. Bunting, both served as officials of the club. The Bunting's continuous association with the club began before 1890 when the archive began. C.J. Bunting became club secretary in 1893 recording in his newspaper archive \"Appointed Honoury Secretary of Seaton Carew Golf Club on the 8th November 1893 but did not take office until the 13th of November 1893 (my birthday)\". Edward Bunting, a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews since 1991, was a marshal at three Open Championships in 1995, 2000 and 2005 and his father Gilbert Bunting was a referee at five Ryder Cups. Edward Bunting, who in 2014 was aged 78, during his amateur golfing career reached a handicap of 1. Bunting had the honour of scoring a \"hole-in-one\" on the Old Course at St Andrews which has been certificated by the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club. This was his only hole-in-one throughout a long amateur golfing career, not as you might expect on a par 3 but on the 307-yard par 4 9th hole on the \"Old Course\".\nThe Seaton Carew Golf Club archives held by the Bunting family have been used to prepare several unpublished papers about the history of the club, but two publications have used them extensively. Firstly, a book celebrating the Centenary of the club was published by Derek Hornby in 1974 entitled \"The History of Seaton Carew Golf Club 1874-1974\". In 1999 Mr Ron Trotter produced a pictorial history of the club to celebrate the 125th anniversary entitled \"125 years of Golf at Seaton Carew 1874-1999\". In this latter publication many of the historical papers, photographs and score cards in the Bunting archive were reproduced. In Mr Hornby's book he makes a very appropriate dedication to the bulk of the golfing fraternity but is particularly pertinent to those such as the Bunting family \"To all those ordinary club golfers who will never be champions but whose whole hearted enthusiasm for the game make them its backbone.\"\nCourse Development.\nOriginally the course was laid out by Dr. McCuaig with 14 holes, 4 extra holes were added by the Club Professional James Kay and opened on 3 August 1891 by the club's first President Major Matthew Gray, but in the 1920s following a remark made by Bernard Darwin in his book \"Golf Courses of Great Britain\" that Seaton was \"grand golfing country but there was not quite enough of it\", the club's members decided to support the redevelopment of the 18 holes. This led the club to call upon the services of course designer Dr. Alister MacKenzie, who went on to create such masterpieces as Augusta National and Cypress Point. He advised the abandonment of some inland holes replacing them with new holes on sandier soil towards the coast, and it's that 1925 layout which forms the basis of today's Old Course at Seaton Carew.\nIn the 1970s the construction of the a cooling water pipeline tunnel for a nearby power station provided the club with a financial windfall and four new holes were added, under the direction of another great golf architect Frank Pennink. They became known as the \"Brabazon loop\" and now provide the club with twenty two holes offering a choice of five different course layouts known as the Old, Brabazon, Micklem, New and Bishop courses. (The Bishop Course is named after a Seaton Carew green keeper, Peter Bishop.) The five course layouts and cards from the championship (white tees) can be seen in the \"Course Records\" section of this page.\nAlways on the look out for innovations in golf course management, in 2012 Seaton Carew began renovation of all of its south facing bunkers using the \"EnviroBunker\" methods and materials. The technology eliminates bunker face drying and sand erosion. The work was completed in time for the 2014 Brabazon Trophy.\n\"Location, Location, Location\".\nSeaton Carew Golf Club is located in a region that is proud of its current industrial capability and historical industrial heritage in shipbuilding, iron, steel and chemical manufacturing. Many of the club's founding members were involved in these industries and like many of the club's current members proud of the local industrial communities. Today most of the industry that is based around the River Tees is part of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster and they, along with the Cleveland Hills, provide the backdrop that dominates the inland views from the course. Some reviewers have commented upon this, but once they have played the Seaton Links come away with a similar impression and sentiments to those expressed by the \"Fine Golf\" Reviewer who said \"the renowned championship links of Seaton Carew on North Tees-side. Though some have remarked disparagingly with regard to its domination by a nearby large nuclear power station, along with other industrial plants that encroach on the inland side and the normal wildness of the links view; in fact these distractions are distant and add in a funny way to the character of the experience, which is one of outstanding championship 'running' golf.\"\nNotable Golfers on the Seaton Carew Golf Links.\n\"Where the Great Ones Trod\".\nMany famous golfers have played Seaton Carew's links over the years, this includes the Great Triumvirate Harry Vardon, J. H. Taylor, and James Braid. Other notable players include Jack White, John Ball and Harold Hilton. Most of the aforementioned players played in professional challenges with Seaton Carew's longest serving professional, Jimmy Kay. HRH Edward, Prince of Wales, played at Seaton Carew in 1930, and later that decade Walter Hagen and Joe Kirkwood stopped off during their tour of Europe. In more recent times Open Champion Sir Nick Faldo and current European Tour players Justin Rose, Graeme Storm, Peter Baker have competed over Seaton's links as amateurs as this course is often a challenging host to many amateur championships. Rose went on to be the U.S. Open Champion in 2013. Nick Faldo played at Seaton Carew in the club's Pro-Am in 1976 winning the professional tournament with a 69 (par 72) on the Old Course. Peter Alliss, the renowned golf commentator, has created video flyovers of all of Seaton Carew's five courses and commented \"The tenth oldest in England and a true championship links to challenge all levels of players.\"\nSeaton Carew's Legendary Club Professional - James Kay (40 year's service 1886 – 1926).\nThe role of a golf professional has changed through the years and it has been described in many famous golfing texts from J.H. Taylor's comprehensive \"Taylor on Golf\" in 1902 (which lists Seaton Carew) through to numerous biographies of the modern day. However too few of the biographies of many of golf's earlier great players have appeared in print but for these players their records speak for them. In this regard few golf clubs can boast of a golfing legend as their long-term professional, an exceptional example is that of Seaton Carew's longest serving professional, James Kay.\nKay, born in Lieth, Scotland in 1855, was engaged by Seaton Carew as their professional on 1 May 1886 following the resignation of Tom Park a member of the famous Park Scottish golfing family. It was Kay's playing record that elevated him above his peers. Press reports of the time showed that Kay played in a total of 22 Open Championships, qualifying in 20 and twice finishing in the top six in the 1892 Open at Muirfield and 1893 Open at Prestwick. On 8 June 1908 he also represented his homeland when he played for Scotland in an international match against England at Prestwick Golf Club. In May 1909, at the age of 53, Kay won the Leeds Cup, a tournament for professional golfers; this is currently the oldest trophy in professional golf worldwide. It was presented to the Professional Golf Association on its formation in 1901 by Alderman Penrose-Green, Lord Mayor of Leeds and President of Leeds Golf Club to be competed for annually by professional golfers. The first competition was held in 1902 at Leeds Golf Club and Kay was one of its earliest winners. Contemporaries record that Kay was \"a veritable demon on the green and extremely adept at laying a stymie and therefore as might be guessed was a very fine match player.\"\nKay played in an era when most of golf's professional players made their money through \"money matches\" and this was where Kay came into his own especially when playing against the top golfers of his era. Pride of place must go to his performances against the Great Triumvirate of Golf. J.H.Taylor, James Braid and Harry Vardon. Many of these memorable matches being reported in newspaper articles of the day that are in the club's historical archive. In 1895 Kay defeated the then Open Champion, Taylor, who had just retained his prestigious title on the Old Course at St Andrews. The match, over 36 holes, took place on 16 June and although the respective scores were equal, James Kay beat his illustrious opponent by one hole. On 22 September 1900, Kay exacted a similar outcome on Braid, although at that time Braid hadn't yet recorded any of his five Open Championship victories. Vardon was the only member of the Great Triumvirate to actually get the better of James Kay on his home course, when he won 6 and 5 on 8 September 1898. In August 1898 Kay, in an Open Professional tournament ay Earlsferry and Elie links, was second only to Vardon, then Open Champion, beating all other leading professionals including Braid, Taylor, Herd and Kirkaldy. But, eventually around the time of his Leeds Cup win, Kay exacted his revenge on Vardon in an exhibition match at Whitby, defeating Vardon by two holes in a 36-hole exhibition match. Not that these money matches were played in anything but the spirit of friendly rivalry as can be detected by Vardon's comment in his 1905 book \"The Complete Golfer\" where he tells how advice from his friend James Kay of Seaton Carew helped him win the 1896 Open Championship.\nOther notable wins for Kay came against other great names in golf, he played Huddersfield professional Alexander Herd who was described as \"one of the finest golfers of his day\" defeating him on 30 June 1894 and also with several championships to his name the well known golfer Mungo Park. Against Park, over the 72 holes, Kay was 11 up at home and 8 up away, thereby winning the match by 19 holes and perhaps more importantly the stake money of £20. A professional called Chisholm, whose home club was Redcar, suffered even greater embarrassment when he was defeated by Kay with a score of 25 up and 24 to play in a 72-hole match on his home course.\nGiven such a remarkable playing record it's not surprising that James Kay was held in great esteem by the club's members, and on 20 July 1911 the Committee agreed to mark the great man's service of 25 years. A total of £23.8s.6d was raised by subscription and a tea and coffee service was presented to him at the club's annual general meeting. Some 14 years later the committee had more serious matters to contemplate, namely Kay's retirement, but the matter was deferred for a further 12 months. On 9 December 1926, after long and serious discussion, it was finally resolved that a change in the professional was necessary. Inquiries were made as to Kay's financial status and it was decided to award him a pension and elect him as an Honorary Member of the club. A gift of £200 was also presented, following another subscription, and Kay's employment came to an end after 41 years.\nKay was himself a notable course designer; the Seaton Carew records show that he was charged with creating four additional holes which were opened on 4 August 1891. The club records of Golf clubs such as Bishop Aukland Golf Club, Middlesbrough Golf Club and Beamish Park Golf Club record Kay's involvement in their design and subsequent works. There are likely to be a number of other clubs which benefited from Kay's advice.\nShortly before his retirement Kay was helping his former assistant to chop up some old railway sleepers, for use as fuel in the clubhouse, when he got a wood splinter in his right thumb. Sadly, he developed blood poisoning, his condition gradually deteriorated and on 17 April 1927 Kay died. His funeral was attended by fellow professionals, Seaton Carew members and staff from the Club acted as pall bearers. The body of this golfing legend was finally laid to rest in Seaton Carew Parish churchyard and he is commemorated in the name of the club's Old Course 8th Hole which is named \"Jimmy Kay\".\nThree Times One-armed Golf Champion – Jack Lithgo (1903-1975).\nAll Clubs are rightly proud of their Champions, Seaton Carew Golf Club has certainly had its share, unusually though, perhaps the most famous amateur golfer to represent this club was one-armed golfer Jack Lithgo. Lithgo lost his arm after a fall at the age of 6. Lithgo lived close to the club and next door to its professional Jimmy Kay. In the club's history books he recalls how in 1909 he remembered Kay bringing home the Leeds Cup and sitting it proudly on his sideboard. Lithgo was a strong swimmer, good footballer and he could hit a golf ball 275 yards with his driver. In 1966, when he was 63 years old, Lithgo qualified yet again for the match play stage of the One-armed Golfers Championship. This was the 19th successive occasion Lithgo had qualified for the knock out stages and remarkably that year he went on to win the final by defeating, by 3 and 1, the 4-time American One-armed champion R. (Bob) Sandler, to whom he was conceding 13 years. This was the 5th time Lithgo had reached the final which he also won in 1948 and 1957.\nAmateur Championships held at Seaton Carew Golf links.\nThe Brabazon Trophy – The English Men's Strokeplay Championship and The Carris Trophy – The English Boys Championships.\nSeaton Carew Golf Club is regular host to top amateur golf competitions. Golf England's Brabazon Trophy was held at this Club in 1985 and the winner, Peter Baker, went on to Ryder Cup and European Tour success after sharing this amateur title with the North East's Roger Roper (Roper famously turned professional at the age of 50 in 2007 to compete on the Seniors Professional Tour.) The 2013 US Open Champion Justin Rose talked glowingly about Seaton's undulating links course when in 1996 he came second behind the then amateur now established tour professional Graeme Storm from Hartlepool, in the Carris Trophy (the Boys' equivalent to the Brabazon Trophy). In June 2014 The Brabazon Trophy tournament returned to Seaton Carew and in line with the illustrious outcomes for past winners on this course a bright future is predicted for the winner Ben Stow from Wiltshire. Stow equalled Seaton Carew's Brabazon Course record on the final day with a \"birdie\" on the final hole to win the Brabazon Trophy by one shot.\nChampionships held at Seaton Carew Links.\nSeaton Carew Golf Club has hosted a number of national championships that attract top international amateur golfers. The club has also hosted international matches between England and the other \"home\" countries. Below is a list of the main amateur championships that have been held at this club and the winners.\nThe Gray Trophy - One of the Earliest English Amateur Club Golf Trophies.\nThe History of this Trophy was meticulously researched by Seaton Carew Golf Club Archivist Mr Edward Bunting in 2000. This is one of the earliest amateur golf trophies to be played for in England and was presented to Seaton Carew Golf Club by Major Matthew Gray. Major Gray, whose military career was associated with the operation of Hartlepool's defensive battery was the son of the Hartlepool shipbuilding magnate Sir William Gray of William Gray &amp; Company. Matthew Gray was a keen golfer and was re-elected President of Seaton Carew Golf Club on 17 November 1883. The minutes of the Club show that in returning his thanks to the members for his re-election it was his intention to present a 20 guinea challenge cup to be played for in stroke play/medal handicap format in the following year by the members. He pronounced that should the cup be won three times outright by any member it would become the absolute property of the gentleman concerned. If no gentleman had won it within 18 months those to have won twice were to play off for the trophy. Between 1884 and 1907 through this magnanimous offer and the continued generosity of the Gray family 8 Gray Trophies were bought and presented by the club. The 8th and last was manufactured by the Goldsmith &amp; Silversmith Company Limited of 110-112 Regent Street London for about £30 and donated by Matthew Gray's widow. Silver trophies manufactured and bought for about £30 in the 1880-1900 period may cost £30,000 to produce in 2014.\nThe 8th Gray Trophy was given to the club by Mrs Eliza (Jeanie) Gray, Major Gray's widow and is still annually played for today by Seaton Carew Golf Club members. The rules however were changed in 1906, prior to the purchase of this last trophy, such that it would be not be retained by the winning member. In fact the competition rules were also adjusted to such that it would be awarded following 6 annual competitions played in alternate months each year and the winner was to be the member who won most competitions. If no member won more than once then a play off between winners would occur. These rules were also later changed to the 4 competitions per annum and continue in the same way today.\nMatthew Gray was himself a winner one of the first 9 \"Gray\" competitions held for the Trophy between February 1884 and May 1885 and a Trophy runner-up on at least one other occasions. Winning a competition during the \"first Gray\" he returned a score of 176 minus his handicap of 32, resulting in a score of 144 for his two rounds. But following the 9 competitions a contemporaneous press report states that \"a beautiful challenge cup\" was presented to Mr R.T. Thompson at an inaugural dinner in the Seaton Hotel. As it happens the runner up for this first trophy was the club's founder Dr Duncan McCuaig. Major Matthew Gray was \"occupying the chair\" at the presentation dinner. Hence Mr Thompson became the owner of the 1st Gray Trophy.\nGray Trophy Winners.\n1st Gray Trophy.\nThe whereabouts of this trophy is unknown\n2nd Gray Trophy.\nDescribed as \"a Silver Claret Jug\" The whereabouts of this trophy is also unknown.\n3rd Gray Trophy.\nThe 3rd Gray Trophy is described in the Golfing Annual of 1888-89 as \"a chaste and elegant piece of silver plate\" this being the third prize donated by club President Major Matthew Gray. The whereabouts of this trophy is also unknown.\nDuring 1890 there seems to have been no Gray Trophy competitions until in January 1890 the President Major Gray announced he was pleased to \"renew his offer to present the club with a trophy\" choosing \"an exceedingly beautiful silver cup, tastefully engraved with ferns and flowers\". It was to be four and a half years before a member had won the 3 competitions required to take the trophy.\n4th Gray Trophy.\nPress reports show that on 6 June 1991 Major Gray has returned from a tour of the World and there was a \"capital turn out of members to welcome home a worthy President\" who competed on a day when \"the weather was everything that could be desired for a sporting game for the Gray Trophy\". Mr L.K.Fawcett won on the day and the new Trophy is described in the press as a \"Handsome Prize\" but it would be another 3 years before the Trophy was again won outright. The whereabouts of this trophy is unknown.\nAn interesting golfing historical note is that Mr Swettenham played at Seaton Carew under an assumed name of \"P.A. Raps\". Although Mr Swettenham's full name appears in the Clubs records P.A.Raps was to appear in the press announcements of the Clubs activities and the public display boards in the Club House. It seems some golfers at that time did not want their employers, customers, parishioners, patients, clients and perhaps even family members to know they were playing golf. Even though competitions were normally held on a Saturday. Sunday golf only began at Seaton Carew after the First World War so this was not even an attempt to disguise Mr Swettenham's absence from Church. The club's records show that several Seaton Carew Golf Club members used such acronyms an this was probably common place at other clubs at that time.\n5th Gray Trophy.\n2 Trophies were presented to the club by Matthew Gray in August 1893 because he was to be absent again while doing a tour of the world. However, tragically, Major Gray was to die before anyone had won the 5th Trophy. 33 competitions were played before the 5th Gray Trophy was won and by then a total of 11 players had won two competitions.\n \nFollowing Mr Pyman's death this the 5th Gray Trophy which is solid silver was donated to Harrogate Golf Club (Starbeck) by his son Noel Pyman when he was elected captain of that club. This is currently known as the \"Pyman Cup - The Seaton Carew Trophy\" and is competed for during that club's annual winter foursomes.\n6th Gray Trophy.\nAgain by chance 33 competitions were to be played before the 6th Gray Trophy winner emerged.\nThe 6th Gray Trophy was still owned by Mr Dickinson 50 years later and it was described in a letter dated 22 December 1953 to the then Club Archivist Mr G. Bunting as having \"a ball design with clubs as part of the handles, with a figure of a Golfer on top\". Mr Dickinson records that he lost his only son in the War and the Trophy may need a home in future years. The whereabouts of this trophy is unknown.\n7th Gray Trophy.\nThe 7th Gray Trophy was donated by William Cresswell Gray (later Baronet Gray) the younger brother of Matthew and himself a member of the club for several years. William had inherited his fathers fortune of £1.5m in 1898 (worth about £100m today). Golf Club records show William was not as \"keen\" a golfer as his brother but played at Seaton Carew. William had many business interests including shipbuilding and a large department store called \"Gray Peverell\" that was to become the department store known well known across the UK during the 20th century as \"Binns\". This trophy was won after only 7 competitions.\nThe widow of Mr Peverell later donated the 7th Gray Trophy back to the Golf Club in 1953 and it is now presented annually to the Seaton Carew Golf Club Champion.\n8th Gray Trophy.\nThe 8th Gray Trophy, is the trophy still played for today and won annually but not retained by the winning Golfer. It was donated by Ms Eliza Gray (also known as Jeanie) and engraved as being donated by Mrs Matthew Gray in 1907. This was Matthew Gray's widow and she took a very active part in choosing the design of the trophy, manufactured Goldsmith &amp; Silversmith Company Limited of London. A note in her hand writing, amongst that of the silversmith's correspondence, is in the club's archives and states \"I like (designs) No. 3 or 4, being a Golf Trophy, I rather think I like the figure, but I am not particular! I do not like the Golf Ball.\" .\nThe golf ball comment by Mrs Gray seems to be a reflection of one of the trophy designs presented to her and not any dislike of the game. Mrs Gray on many occasions during her husband's lifetime was present and contributed to the club's social functions. This is mentioned in a number of associated press cuttings from that time, she attended alongside many of the wives of the Club members. These records how she and the other ladies \"graced\" those social and sporting events. Eventually a more classical design was finally agreed for the elegant 8th Gray Trophy that is still very much prized by the members of Seaton Carew Golf Club.\nMrs Matthew Gray Local Benefactor.\nEliza Gray, like her husband became a considerable local benefactor. In 1914 she made a £500 donation towards the raising of a battalion of the Durham Light Infantry which became known as \"The Durham Pals\". Mrs Gray died in 1917 at the home that Matthew had purchased for them just before he died suddenly in 1896, The Willows, Clarence Road, Hartlepool. Matthew and Eliza were childless and The Willows was soon after donated to the town of Hartlepool as a museum by Sir William Cresswell Gray, Matthew's brother. This was a gesture of thanksgiving for the safe return of his own son William (1895-1978) from the First World War. The Museum was opened to the public in 1920. The Museum of Hartlepool has since moved to purpose built facilities and The Willows is now an art gallery operated by Hartlepool Borough Council.The publicly owned facility has been renamed Sir William Gray House.\nThe Sudden Death of Matthew Gray.\nMatthew Gray was born in Hartlepool in 1855 and worked through several technical and business departments at his father's, Sir William Gray's, shipyards and gaining distinctions in his \"Oxford &amp; Cambridge examinations\". Eventually he became a partner in his father's Hartlepool based shipbuilding business William Gray &amp; Company. Matthew Gray's later business interests specialised in the manufacture of steel plate which complimented his family's ship building interests. In August 1889, for example, he is recorded as being on board during the maiden voyage and sea trials of the S.S. Empress Considerable built by William Gray &amp; Co. Gray also took a keen interest in politics and as staunch Liberal delivered many speeches in support of that political party during the General Election the year before his death. These speeches were reported as :marked by great vigour\" and showed that he had \"a somewhat wide grasp of the political problems of the day\". His obituary in the Northern Daily Mail notes that \"Mr Gray's liberality to the work-people and those dependent on them will long be remembered. And withal it was characterised with the utmost un-ostentation. Mr Gray was always willing to support by his presence and purse every good effort – whether social, religious or athletic. He was President of the Seaton Carew Golf Club from its commencement, and as our readers will know has long presented a challenge trophy which has been played for regularly\". On occasions the Seaton Carew Golf Club was short of funds but its records show that its first President Gray was a considerable benefactor. Especially so during the building of the club house in 1893. In 1886 the club was in the red to the tune of £11 10 shillings and 6 pence but Gray quietly donated a cheque for that sum. Matthew Gray contracted pneumonia after a short illness and died suddenly on 16 June 1896 and pursuant with the property amendment act of 1859 his death was formally announced in the London Gazette on 20 November that year. Major Matthew Gray's funeral took place on 19 June 1896 and is reported to have taken place in the presence of thousands of people.\nSeaton Carew Golf Club Annual Competitions for Amateur Golfers.\nThe results of the following competitions can be found in the Club archive dating from the 1880s. The trophies themselves are also well documented in the books by Mr Trotter and Mr Hornby.\nMen's Open Competition - The Seaton Salver.\n36 hole open scratch medal. Played annually since 1969 and the trophy donated by former Cub President J.E.Guthe.\nMen: Members Competitions.\nClub Championship.\n36 hole scratch medal competition.

        "text": "The 2014–15 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Butler University in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Chris Holtmann, who took over as interim head coach after Brandon Miller requested and was granted a medical leave of absence from the university. Holtmann was then named the permanent head coach on January 2, 2015, becoming the 23rd head coach of Butler's men's basketball team. The Bulldogs played their home games at Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 9,100. This was Butler's second season in the Big East Conference. They finished the season 23–11, 12–6 in Big East play to finish in a tie for second place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Big East tournament to Xavier. The Bulldogs received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed and defeated Texas in the second round before losing in the Third Round to Notre Dame.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bulldogs finished the 2013–14 season with a record of 14–17, 4–14 in Big East play to finish in ninth place. They lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to Seton Hall.\nOff season.\n2014 recruiting class.\nButler's 2014 spring recruiting run was able to stymie some of the postseason woes of 2013–14, with the entire freshman class save Andrew Chrabascz and walk-on Steven Bennett electing to transfer from the program along with Devontae Morgan from the sophomore class. The Bulldogs gained some considerable size in the front court this season, bringing in three freshman power forwards ranging from 6'6\" to 6'8\" and a small forward in Austin Etherington, a red-shirt junior transfer from Indiana who is immediately eligible to play. Another highlight of Butler's spring recruiting run was the addition of McDonald's All-American point guard Tyler Lewis, who elected to transfer from NC State and will sit out a year and start playing in the 2015–16 season per NCAA regulations.\nDepartures.\nAfter the previous season ended, four players announced that they would transfer. Sophomore guard Devontae Morgan, freshman forward Nolan Berry, freshman guard Elijah Brown, and freshman walk-on guard Michael Volovic announced their transfers at various times in the postseason.\nRegular season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East Conference Play\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#13294B; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\n2014–15 Postseason.\nAs part of the Final Four weekend, on April 2 Alex Barlow represented Butler in the State Farm 2015 College Slam Dunk and 3-pt contest. After advancing past the first two rounds, Barlow met Kevin Pangos in the final round, just barely getting edged, 22-21. A sold out Hinkle Fieldhouse erupted in cheers for the graduating senior, a fan favorite. Another Butler senior, Kameron Woods, participated in the Reese's College All-Star Game on the East Team, joining five other Big East players on the roster. Although the East lost to the West 109-87, Woods dominated the glass, pulling down 14 rebounds - six more than any other player in the game."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Rugby Pro D2 was the second-level French rugby union club competition, behind the Top 14, for the 2014–15 season. It ran alongside the 2014–15 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). The average team salaries at the outset of the 2014–15 season were €5.97m; Biarritz and Perpignan had the highest team salaries with €11.07m.\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2013–14 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe top team at the end of the regular season (after all the teams played one another twice, once at home, once away), is declared champion and earns a spot in the next Top 14 season. Teams ranked second to fifth compete in promotion playoffs, with the semifinals being played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final is then played on neutral ground, and the winner earns the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nRelegation.\nPreviously, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or prevent one of the two finalists in Fédérale 1 from promotion.\nThis season saw an example of the latter situation. Following the 2014–15 season, 15th-place Dax was spared relegation after Fédérale 1 runner-up Lille was denied promotion due to excessive debt and failed in an appeal of the decision.\nThe last instance of a team outside the bottom two places being relegated was at the end of the 2011–12 season, when 9th-place Bourgoin were relegated, thereby reprieving 15th-place Béziers.\nFixtures.\nThe outline fixtures schedule was announced on 16 May 2014.\nRound 14.\nWeekend of 13 December 2014\nRound 15.\nWeekend of 20 December 2014\nRound 16.\nWeekend of 10 January 2015\nRound 17.\nWeekend of 17 January 2015\nRound 18.\nWeekend of 24 January 2015\nRound 19.\nWeekend of 31 January 2015\nRound 20.\nWeekend of 7 February 2015\nRound 21.\nWeekend of 21 February 2015\nRound 22.\nWeekend of 28 February 2015\nRound 23.\nWeekend of 7 March 2015\nRound 24.\nWeekend of 14 March 2015\nRound 25.\nWeekend of 28 March 2015\nRound 26.\nWeekend of 4 April 2015\nRound 27.\nWeekend of 11 April 2015\nRound 28.\nWeekend of 25 April 2015\nRound 29.\nWeekend of 2 May 2015\nRound 30.\nWeekend of 9 May 2015\nPlay–offs.\nThe highest ranked team at the end of the regular season, Pau, earned automatic promotion to the Top 14 as \"champion de France de PRO D2 2015\".\nSemi–finals.\nThe semi–finals followed a 2 v 5, 3 v 4 system, with the higher ranked team playing at home.\nFinal.\nThe winners of the semi–finals played off for the second promotion spot to the Top 14."

The cities also housed the 32 teams and fan-zones for spectators without tickets for the stations. Around 3 million tickets were put on sale of which most were sold out in a day. Eighteen locations were presented as potential host cities with the twelve successful candidates announced on 31 May 2009: Belém, Campo Grande, Florianópolis, Goiânia and Rio Branco were rejected, while Maceió had already withdrawn in January 2009.\nFIFA proposed that no more than one city could use two stadiums, and the number of host cities was limited between eight and ten. However, FIFA subsequently accepted the Brazilian Football Confederation's suggestion to use twelve host cities in \"the interest of the whole country\". The twelve selections – each the capital of its state – covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil provided, when matches were concentrated in the south-east and south. Consequently, the tournament required significant long-distance travel for teams. Statistics show that nearly 10 million passengers used around 20 Brazilian airports in 31 days of the tournament.\nStadiums.\nThe 64 matches were staged at the following 12 stadiums:\nTeams' stay.\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team. The table below shows base camps and venues for each team.\nFIFA Fan Fests.\nFor a third consecutive World Cup tournament, FIFA announced they would be holding FIFA Fan Fests in each of the twelve host cities. Prominent examples are the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which had already held a Fan Fest in 2010, São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú and Brasília's Esplanada dos Ministérios, with the Congress in the background. The official \"kick-off event\" for the 2014 Fan Fest took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on Sunday, June 8, 2014, according to FIFA's official website."

        "text": "The 2014–15 VMI Keydets basketball team represented the Virginia Military Institute in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Keydets were led by tenth-year head coach Duggar Baucom and played their home games out of Cameron Hall, their home since 1981. VMI rejoined the Southern Conference after an eleven-year absence, having been a member of the Big South from 2003 to 2014. VMI was a member of the SoCon from 1924 until 2003. They finished the season 11–19, 7–11 in SoCon play to finish in sixth place. They lost in the quarterfinals of the SoCon tournament to Mercer.\nOn March 28, head coach Duggar Baucom resigned to take the same position at The Citadel. He finished with a record of 151–159 in ten seasons.\nPreseason.\nDepartures.\nVMI graduated three seniors in 2014, including two of their top scorers, guard Rodney Glasgow and center D. J. Covington. Additionally, on October 29, 2014, head coach Duggar Baucom announced that brothers Ot and Jon Elmore would be withdrawing from the team as well as VMI. Ot was an academic sophomore who was redshirted in 2013–14 and did not appear in a game. Jon was a highly sought-after freshman. Their father, Gay Elmore, who once played at VMI and is currently second on the school's all-time point-scoring list, said in a statement to \"The Charleston Gazette\" that the brothers left the school because of a \"personal family matter\".\nLater in the year, shortly following a 63–75 road loss to UNC Greensboro, it was announced that VMI guard and leading scorer QJ Peterson was placed on a medical furlough and would not be attending VMI for the remainder of the academic year. Peterson ended the season averaging 19.6 points per game, but did so on only 34% overall shooting and 27% from the three-point line.\nCoaching changes.\nOn May 22, 2014, it was announced that VMI hired Ben Thompson as an assistant coach to the program. Thompson came from UNC Pembroke as an assistant and part of a Brave team that made back-to-back winning seasons from 2011 to 2013, the first time in over twenty years the school had accomplished that feat. He is a 2006 graduate of Virginia Tech. Thompson replaced longtime VMI assistant Jason Allison, who had been with the team since Baucom began coaching in 2005. Allison departed for an assistant coaching job with Appalachian State.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#FF0000; color:#FFFF00;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#FF0000; color:#FFFF00;\"| SoCon tournament"

        "text": "Jon Paul Mueller (born January 26, 1970) is an American college baseball coach who has been the head coach of Albany since the start of the 2000 season. Mueller, who was named the 2004 America East Coach of the Year, led the Great Danes to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 2007.\nPlaying career.\nMueller attended Stillwater High School in upstate New York, where he played baseball and basketball. Mueller won a state basketball championship in his senior season, 1988. He was offered a basketball scholarship at Siena, but chose instead to attend Eckerd. He played both basketball and baseball at the Florida college as a freshman and sophomore but focused exclusively on baseball as a junior and senior. He graduated in 1992.\nAfter getting his master's degree from Saint Rose in 1994, Mueller began a seven-year professional baseball career spent entirely in independent leagues. From 1994 to 1995, he played for the Marshall Mallards and Will County Claws in the short-lived North Central League. Partway through the 1995 season, he returned to upstate New York, where he played for the Adirondack Lumberjacks from 1995 to 1996 and the Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs from 1997 to 2000. Primarily a first baseman and an outfielder, Mueller had a career .286 batting average and hit 76 home runs.\nCoaching career.\nSaint Rose.\nMueller's first coaching job came with Saint Rose from 1993 to 1994, where he worked as an assistant while getting his master's degree.\nAlbany.\nIn 1999, Mueller worked as a volunteer assistant at Albany under head coach Doug O'Brey. In the program's last season in Division II, the Great Danes went 21–21 and reached the ECAC Tournament final.\nMueller was hired as Albany's head coach the following season, the Great Danes' first in Division I. Playing as an independent, they went 19–24. After the season, he played his last season of professional baseball. Albany joined the America East Conference for the 2002 season. In 2004, the team went 37–14 and tied for second in conference. It appeared in its first America East tournament and Mueller was named the conference's Coach of the Year.\nMueller led the program to its first NCAA tournament in 2007. After a 26–27 (13–11 America East) regular season, the Great Danes received the third seed in the 2007 America East tournament. There, they defeated Stony Brook in the opener and Binghamton twice to win the championship and the conference's automatic bid to the 2007 NCAA tournament. At the Fayetteville Regional, the team went 0–2, losing 9–0 to host Arkansas and 21–11 to second-seeded Creighton.\nFrom 2000 to 2019, eight of Mueller's players have been selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. The highest selection was Stephen Woods in 2016, an 8th-round selection of the San Francisco Giants.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Mueller's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics took place at Grünau Regatta Course, near Berlin, Germany. The event was held from 11 to 14 August. There were 20 competitors from 20 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Gustav Schäfer of Germany, the nation's first victory in the event and first medal of any colour in the men's single sculls since 1908. Josef Hasenöhrl took silver, Austria's first medal in the event. Dan Barrow earned bronze, extending the United States' podium streak in the event to five Games; the Americans had taken a medal in each of the six times they competed in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nNone of the 5 rowers from the 1932 Games returned. Australia's Cecil Pearce was the cousin of 1928 and 1932 gold medalist Bobby Pearce, who had turned professional after the 1932 Games (and thus was no longer eligible under the amateurism rules in place at the time). The pre-race favorite was Ernst Rufli of Switzerland, the two-time reigning Diamond Challenge Sculls champion. Humphrey Warren of Great Britain, Gustav Schäfer of Germany, and Jiří Zavřel of Czechoslovakia were also significant contenders.\nArgentina, Brazil, Estonia, Norway, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its eighth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nDespite having five more rowers than the previous record of 15 at the 1928 Games, the 1932 Games used only 4 rounds (to the 1928 tournament's 7). There were three main rounds and a repechage. The number of boats allowed in individual races was expanded from prior Games, with the final reaching six boats for the first time.\nThe course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first rower in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The others competed again in the repechage for remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe winner of each race advanced to the semifinals; the other rowers were eliminated.\nSemifinals.\nThe first three rowers in each heat advanced to the final."

Released to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup, it was intended to dissuade supporters of the England national football team from referring to the Second World War while in Germany for the tournament.\nHistory.\nThe song references Cleese's \"Fawlty Towers\" character Basil Fawlty's line in \"The Germans\" episode: \"Don't mention the war. I did but I think I got away with it\". Cleese released this song as a way to try and change English feelings towards Germans and to move people away from associating Germans with the Second World War. Cleese recorded his lines for the song as Basil Fawlty. German authorities supported the song as a way to dissuade supporters of the England and Australia national football teams from displaying Nazi symbols or gestures during the World Cup. The song was also intended to get England fans to refrain from using rude words towards Germans.\nThe song also made an allusion to comedian Stan Boardman's German jokes with the line, \"They bombed our chip shops\". Boardman, who also wrote a World Cup song, \"Stan's World Cup Song\", stated that he felt Cleese's use of his joke was \"very cheeky\" and didn't believe that Cleese had a chip shop in his hometown of Weston-Super-Mare.\nReception.\n\"Don't Mention the World Cup\" was released on 12 June 2006; however, it failed to chart in the UK Singles Charts. The song was also criticised in \"\", which gave it two stars and stated that \"Cleese's flat delivery is Fawlty\". Nonetheless, despite lack of UK chart success, press and television coverage was generally favourable. The song was featured on ITV News in a segment on football violence."

Therefore, assistant head coach Les Kiss, was named as interim head coach for the Summer Tour to Canada and United States.\nThe initial squad was named on 19 May 2014, with Rory Best as captain. It was a significantly weaker squad due to a number of regular Irish players in the British &amp; Irish Lions squad for their 2013 tour to Australia. The squad then lost their original captain, Rory Best, on 26 May, due to a call to the Lions squad. Peter O'Mahony was named as his replacement in terms of captaincy, and Seán Cronin filled the void left in the hookers. Ahead of the test against Canada, Ireland then lost Simon Zebo to the Lions.

It was the first time that Glasgow hosted the games, and the third time it was hosted in Scotland after Edinburgh hosted in 1970 and 1986. A total of 4,947 athletes from 71 Commonwealth Games Associations (CGAs) competed in 261 events in 17 sports. \nAthletes from 37 participating CGAs won at least one medal; athletes from 21 CGAs won at least one gold medal. England led the medal table for the first time since 1986, winning 58 golds and 174 medals overall. Australia came second, after leading the medal table for the last six consecutive games, while Canada came third. Hosts Scotland enjoyed their best-ever performance by finishing in fourth place with a record 19 gold medals and 53 overall. Kiribati won its first-ever Commonwealth Games medal, a gold in the men's 105 kg weightlifting competition. Grenada won its first Commonwealth Games gold medal in the men's 400 metres. South African swimmer Chad le Clos won the most medals, a total of seven including two gold, one silver and four bronze. Canadian rhythmic gymnast Patricia Bezzoubenko won the most gold medals with five in addition to a bronze medal.\nMedal table.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt; \nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a Commonwealth Games Association). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their three-letter country code.\nTwo bronze medals were awarded in boxing, judo and wrestling, except for Women's freestyle 75 kg as only five competitors were entered in the event. Additionally, two bronze medals were awarded in the men's 100 m backstroke and women's pole vault as a result of a tie between two athletes. No bronze medal was awarded in the men's synchronized 10 metre platform as only four teams competed in the event. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals.\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nWeightlifting.\nThe women's 53 kg competition was originally won by 16-year-old Chika Amalaha of Nigeria. Following a failed doping test, Amalaha was stripped of her medal and placement, and the medals were redistributed. Dika Toua of Papua New Guinea was awarded the gold, Santoshi Matsa of India, silver and Swati Singh, also of India, bronze."

        "text": "The men's track time trial cycling event at the 1948 Summer Olympics took place on 11 August and was one of six events at the 1948 Olympics. Twenty-one cyclists from 21 nations competed, with each nation limited to one competitor. The event was won by Jacques Dupont of France, the nation's first victory in the event since 1896 and third consecutive podium appearance. Pierre Nihant earned Belgium's first medal in the men's track time trial with his silver; Tommy Godwin similarly took Great Britain's first medal in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896 and every Games since 1928. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. None of the cyclists from 1936 returned. Jacques Dupont of France was the French champion and had set an unofficial world record of 1:08.6.\nCuba, Guyana, India, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela each made their debut in the men's track time trial. France and Great Britain each made their fifth appearance, having competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Each cyclist raced one kilometre from a standing start. The track's asphalt surface led to slow times.\nRecords.\nThe following were the world and Olympic records prior to the competition.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition."

        "text": "The men's sprint cycling event at the 1948 Summer Olympics took place between 7 and 9 August and was one of six events at the 1948 Olympics. There were 23 cyclists from 23 nations, with each nation limited to one competitor. The event was won by Mario Ghella of Italy, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint. Reg Harris of Great Britain, heavily favored coming into the event, finished with silver, the first medal for a British cyclist in the sprint since 1920. Axel Schandorff's bronze was Denmark's first medal in the event since 1928. The podium streaks of the Netherlands (five Games) and France (four Games) both ended, with neither nation's cyclist able to advance to the quarterfinals.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. None of the semifinalists from 1936 returned, but Howard Wing of China competed again after the 12-year break occasioned by World War II. The heavy favorite and host nation hero was 1947 World Champion Reg Harris; his biggest rival, Cor Bijster of the Netherlands, had turned professional and could not compete in the Games.\nCuba, Guyana, India, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its ninth appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds. Each race involved the riders starting simultaneously and next to each other, from a standing start. Because the early part of races tend to be slow-paced and highly tactical, only the time for the last 200 metres of the race is typically recorded (though the full time for these Games was recorded as well). The distance for the sprint in 1948 was actually 920 metres instead of the standard 1000 metres, to be exactly two laps of the track.\nThe first two rounds consisted of single races between pairs of cyclists. The berths in the second round were allocated to the winners from each of the races in the first round, and the winners from each race in the repechage round. Starting with the quarterfinals stage, cyclists were paired once again, this time racing against each other two times, with the winner advancing further in the competition. This was the first time that the best-of-three format was used for the quarterfinals and semifinals (having been introduced in 1932 for the final and expanded to the bronze medal match in 1936).\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new Olympic record was set during the competition.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nRound 1 heat 1.\nRocca won by two lengths.\nRound 1 heat 2.\nVan De Velde won by a wheel.

The Uruguayan team protested the result, however, and the protest was successful. The heat was ordered to be re-run on the next day of competition (two days later). The delay for the appeal led to 40 minutes of inactivity on the track, which the spectators did not appreciate. The result also delayed the start of the later rounds from Saturday to Monday. In the re-run, Rocca won by two lengths.\nRound 2 heat 3.\nMasanés won by inches.\nRound 2 heat 4.\nSchandorff won easily.\nRound 2 heat 5.\nVan De Velde won by half a wheel.\nRound 2 heat 6.\nHeid won by an inch.\nRound 2 heat 7.\nBazzano won by one and a half lengths.\nRound 2 heat 8.\nHarris won by a length.\nQuarterfinals.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nGhella won the first race by a length and the second by two lengths.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nSchandorff won the first race by a length and the second by two lengths.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nHarris won both races by a length.\nQuarterfinal 4.\nBazzano won the first race by a wheel and the second by a length and a half.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal 1.\nGhella won the first race by three-quarters of a length and the second by three lengths.\nSemifinal 2.\nHarris won the first race by a length and the second by three-quarters of a length.\nFinals.\nBronze medal match.\nSchandorff won the first race by three-quarters of a length and the second by two lengths.\nFinal.\nGhella won the first race by three lengths and the second by one and a half lengths. In the first, Ghella made his attack at the 300-yard mark, passing Harris on the inside (accorded a tactical error to leave space inside by the British cyclist). The final distance between the two was increased by Harris easing off to conserve energy for the second race. Doing so did him little good, however, as in the second race Ghella took the lead and fought off two challenges by Harris in the final two straights."

        "text": "The 2014 AFC Challenge Cup Final was an association football match between Palestine and the Philippines on 30 May 2014 at the National Football Stadium in Malé, Maldives.\nBackground.\nThe AFC Challenge Cup was an international football competition for Asian Football Confederation (AFC) nations that was categorized as \"emerging countries\" in the \"Vision Asia\" program.

The AFC Challenge Cup, which reflected the philosophy of \"Vision Asia\", was created for teams to experience playing in a continental competition with the possibility to win an AFC trophy and potentially discover new talent. It was held in every two years as its inaugural edition took place on 2006 in Bangladesh. This 2014 Challenge Cup was the last season, due to the expansion of participating national teams in the AFC Asian Cup from 16 to 24. Maldives won the hosting rights, with two renovated stadiums (Addu Football Stadium and National Football Stadium) were used as venues in the tournament. The winner qualifies for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.\nThe two countries met twice before the finals match. Their first meeting was in the qualification phase of the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup on 23 March 2011 which ended in a goalless draw. While their second match together was at the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup third-place playoff, where the Filipinos won the game, 4–3. That result causes the Philippines to grab their best finish yet in a major tournament and in the Challenge Cup. Michael Weiss, then head coach of the Philippines congratulated his team by \"showing their fighting spirit\" throughout the game. He later admitted that \"[he did not] expected the match to go that way\". While, Palestine head coach Jamal Mahmoud described their last game against them was \"the worst game that we ever played in international football\". Like the Philippines, Palestine also made history as they were the first West Asian team to be in the knockout stage of the tournament. The Philippines were considered the \"favorites\" heading towards the game. Goal.com predicted that the Filipinos were more likely to beat Palestine in a 2–1 scoreline.\nRoute to the final.\nBefore going to the main contest proper, all participating countries except Maldives competed in a qualifying round. Twenty nations confirmed their interest to take part in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers with Brunei withdrawing a day before the qualifiers citing \"unavoidable circumstances\". The winner of each group, and the best and better ranked second placed teams qualified for the AFC Challenge Cup proper. The teams in the group stages was trimmed down to eight, with the first and second ranked teams of each group advancing to the knockout stage."

This was so that teams had a longer preparation time ahead of the 2015 Rugby World Cup which started on 18 September. However, New Zealand hosted an additional match against Australia in Auckland on 15 August which acted as the second Bledisloe Cup test and as a World Cup warm-up.

        "title": "1923–24 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1923–24 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team (variously \"North Carolina\", \"Carolina\" or \"Tar Heels\") was the fourteenth varsity college basketball team to represent the University of North Carolina (UNC) as a part of the Southern Conference (SoCon) for the NCAA season. The team went undefeated, and the season was the first played in the Tin Can. The head coach was Norman Shepard, coaching in his first and only season with the Tar Heels. Their fast play and defense won them the 1924 Southern Conference men's basketball tournament.\nThe Tar Heels by winning the SoCon tournament were named Southern champions, and were retroactively named national champions in 1943 by Bill Schroeder of the Helms Foundation, a Los Angeles-based organization dedicated to the promotion of athletics and sportsmanship. North Carolina has one of the most prestigious college basketball programs, with their first official national championship coming in 1957. The 1924 team is thus one of the school's first great teams, when the nationally prominent athletic schools were in the northeast or midwest rather than the south.\nAll of the team's players were from North Carolina. The team's high scorer was forward Jack Cobb, known as \"Mr. Basketball\" and the earliest of eight Tar Heels basketball players who have had their jersey retired. The team also featured All-American Cartwright Carmichael, brother of William for whom the Carmichael Arena is named. Others stars included pivot man Bill Dodderer, and guard and three-sport athlete Monk McDonald, considered the best all-around athlete to ever attend UNC. The team's captain was forward Winton Green.\nBefore the season.\nThis season, for the first time, each player who was fouled was required to shoot their own free throws. It used to be a shooter from among the players on the court was designated by each team as the person to take all the free throws. In these early days of the sport, there was a \"running guard\" who dribbled the ball up the court and passed or attacked the basket, like a point or combo guard. There was also a \"stationary guard\" who made long shots and hung back on defense before there was the rule of backcourt violations. Nobody on the UNC team was taller than 6 feet 4 inches, which in those days was considered exceptionally large.\nThe Tar Heels had played the previous two seasons without a coach. \"The Tar Heel\" wrote that \"If Carolina continues to lead the South in this branch of athletics, a capable coach will have to be employed.\" On January 16, 1923, it was announced that Graduate Manager of Athletics Charles T. Woollen tapped current law student and Freshman football and basketball coach Norman Shepard to become head coach of the varsity basketball team. Shepard had turned down the opportunity to coach the varsity team prior to their previous season because he felt he was busy coaching the Freshman teams already and was completing his Bachelor of Sciences degree in Commerce. Shepard had played Freshman football and basketball at Carolina in 1919 then left the school for Davidson College where he continued to be an athlete. Shepard had a brief stint in minor league baseball and attended the University of Illinois' coaching school led by football coach Robert Zuppke. After taking the position, Shepard stated: \"I hadn't intended to stay in coaching.\"\nPrior to the season, practice was being held three times a week. Expectations were high due to the performance of the team the previous two years, winning the Southern Conference tournament in 1922 and going undefeated in the 1922–23 regular season, only to lose in the tournament due to fatigue and illness. The student-run newspaper, \"The Tar Heel\" published a pre-season article where an author wrote: \"Carolina has without a doubt the chance of her life to set fire to this neck of the woods during the coming season.\" Seniors Cartwright Carmichael, Monk McDonald, and Winton Green were cited as being among the best players in the South. Carmichael last season was retroactively selected All-American, the earliest Tar Heel to be selected such for any sport.\n\"The Charlotte Observer\" wrote that Winton Green, Jack Cobb, and Jimmy Poole were the best looking forwards on the team in their season preview. The writer also expressed belief that the bench for this team was much deeper than that of the 1921–22 conference tournament champions. Poole weighed 120 pounds but was fast and could pass well. Jack Cobb and Billy Devin got promoted to varsity from the previous season's Freshman team. Cobb quickly became known as \"Mr. Basketball\" on campus. Cobb was versatile on the court and able to shoot, rebound, and pass effectively. Bill Dodderer, star of the 1921 Freshman team, returned to school after a season's absence and got placed on the varsity.\nWinton Green was named captain for the team for the 1923–24 season. Monk McDonald had been captain last season, and Carmichael two seasons ago. Guard Carl Mahler who played in the previous season, did not return to school and thus was not a part of the team. Sam McDonald was announced to be returning in early December and thought to be the one to replace Mahler's guard spot, but later did not participate. Monk McDonald was also a medical student, who did not participate in practices due to schoolwork, and was not expected to be on the court until after Christmas. The only reserve not expected to return was Thomas Graham.\nCoach Shepard later recalled, \"That 1924 team was characterized by quickness and speed...It was a very, very fast team, and we used the fast break effectively...I had inherited a very good group of boys from the team before...Carmichael and Dodderer were exceptionally good...Carmichael and Cobb were so fast and quick with their faking and feinting and breaking, and Carmichael could drive to the basket with unbelievable speed and hold himself in the air for a long time, like he was suspended.\"\nRoster.\nDepth chart.\nSubstitutes.\nAfter Green's injury in the Maryland game, Devin took his spot in the starting five.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#56A0D3; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Southern Conference tournament\nSeason summary.\n\"The Charlotte Observer\" felt Carolina's schedule was \"exceptionally hard\" and pointed to the Mercer game being a tough one after Christmas break since they were runner's up in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament two seasons ago.\nThe latter portion of the schedule was revised and announced on January 8, 1924. The alterations mainly involved date changes with games like the Mercer game being moved from January 9 to the 8th, the Washington &amp; Lee and Virginia games swapped dates, and the Durham Elks game that was scheduled for January 4 was pushed back to January 22nd. In addition, there were five open dates revealed. The schedule, as in years past, featured a northern tour that will go through the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.\nUNC beat Mercer 35 to 23. \"Two thousand spectators, well wrapped in overcoats, shivered away...and saw the \"Tin Can\" christened with a victory.\" Cobb scored 14, and Mercer star George Harmon was held to just one field goal. Consuello Smith led Mercer scorers with 8.\nGuilford was beaten 50 to 22. Cobb made 10 field goals and the entire Guilford team made 9. All of Carmichael, Cobb, and Dodderer were used at center.\nDurham Elks was beaten 49 to 23. The scored was tied 18 to 18 at the end of the first half. UNC outscored Durham Elks 31 to 5 in the second half.\nDuring the Elon game, Cartwright Carmichael was shifted to guard and Bill Dodderer took over at center. What followed was the season's biggest win, 60 to 13. The first half ended 33 to 3. Cobb led scorers with 20. Green had 17. Carmichael had 10 and McDonald had 9.\nIn the game with Maryland on February 5, captain Green received a Charley-horse which incapacitated him for the rest of the season. Carmichael took over as captain.\nSoCon Tournament.\nOn February 29, 1924, UNC beat Kentucky, 41–20, in the first-ever game of the Kentucky–North Carolina rivalry. Kentucky's star player James McFarland had been a high school All-American. Cobb and Carmichael combined for 31 points, \"and easily poured in enough shots from long distance to win the game\".\nOn March 1, UNC won 37–20 over a Vanderbilt team coached by Josh Cody and led by Pep Bell. Cobb scored 17.\nIn the semifinals, UNC defeated the defending SoCon champion Mississippi A&amp;M team led by K. P. Gatchell. A&amp;M's H. G. Perkins, a good shooter from long-distance, played in the first half despite injuries to his ankle and hand, and could not finish the game. Carmichael and Cobb combined for 25 points.\nAnd in the final, UNC beat Alabama 26–18, coached by Hank Crisp and led by Slim Carter. The game was considered close. \"For the first time\" since the start of the tournament \"the Tarheel was laboring.\" Alabama was marred by foul trouble. They had two players foul out, and then Carter fouled out, leaving Alabama with only four players. \"Captain Carmichael, of North Carolina, waived the rule and insisted on Carter's remaining in the game.\" Cobb scored 15.\nAftermath.\nThe local news reported that hundreds of students at North Carolina \"waited in the streets in front of telegraph offices and cafes\" for news about the game and after the victory students \"went wild\" and set a bonfire on the athletic field. Some 500 students marched to Cobb's house in Durham and woke up the household with fight songs. Head cheeleader Vic Huggins reportedly led a group of around 500 to Durham to welcome the team home after beating Alabama who arrived at around 4 AM local time.\nOn March 4, \"The Tar Heel\" reported that Coach Shepard would be leaving in March for China to work as a representative for the Liggett and Myers Tobacco Company. His departure caused \"a great deal of regret\" for the student body. Monk McDonald was hired as head coach, and Jack Cobb was elected captain.\nCarmichael and Cobb were retroactively named as All-Americans by the Helms Foundation at the Forward position for 1924. The Helms Athletic Foundation retroactively named All-America teams for years 1905–35, and are considered the \"official\" teams of those years by the NCAA. Carmichael, Cobb, and Monk McDonald made the contemporary All-Southern Conference tournament team by sportswriter Morgan Blake.\nIn 1943, after spending six months researching material, the Helms Athletic Foundation named the team retroactive national champions. In 2009, the Premo-Porretta Power Poll added rankings for the 1895–96 through 1947–48 seasons, which also deemed the Tar Heels national champions for the 1923–24 season."

        "text": "The 1934 Nanga Parbat climbing disaster resulted in the loss of 10 lives on Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth-highest mountain and one of the 14 eight-thousanders. The disaster, which happened during the 1934 climbing season, included nine climbers who died in what was, at the time, the single deadliest mountaineering accident in history.\nEvent.\nIn 1934, German climber Willy Merkl led a well financed expedition to Nanga Parbat (located in Jammu and Kashmir, British India; present-day Gilgit-Baltistan, northeastern Pakistan), with the full backing of the new Nazi government. Early in the expedition died, probably of high-altitude pulmonary edema. The Tyrolean climbers and reached an estimated height of (7,895 m / 25,900 ft) on July 6, but were forced to return because of worsening weather. On July 7, they and 14 others were trapped by a ferocious storm at 7,480 m (24,540 ft). During the desperate retreat that followed, three famous German mountaineers, , and Merkl himself, as well as six Sherpas, died of exhaustion, exposure and altitude sickness, and several more suffered severe frostbite. The last survivor to reach safety, Ang Tsering, did so having spent seven days battling through the storm. It has been said that the disaster, \"for sheer protracted agony, has no parallel in climbing annals.\"\nBooks.\nJonathan Neale wrote a book about the 1934 climbing season on Nanga Parbat called \"Tigers of the Snow\". He interviewed many old Sherpas, including Ang Tsering, the last man off Nanga Parbat alive in 1934. The book attempts to narrate what went wrong on the expedition, set against mountaineering history of the early twentieth century, the background of German politics in the 1930s, and the hardship and passion of life in the Sherpa valleys."

        "title": "2014 Korea Professional Baseball season",
        "text": "The Korea Professional Baseball season is 33rd season in the history of the Korea Professional Baseball.\nSeason Structure.\nRegular season.\nStarting in season 2013, each team plays 128 games in the regular season, reduced from 133 due to expansion to nine teams. Each team plays every other 16 times.\nThere will be a third change in four seasons to the tie rule in South Korean professional baseball. In South Korean baseball, ties are called after 12 innings in the regular season and 15 innings in the playoffs. In 2008, the league briefly scrapped ties and forced teams to play until a winner was decided. But managers strongly opposed the change. The KBO went back to the 12-inning tie rule starting in 2009.\nVideo Replay.\nResponding to growing calls to address issues in refereeing, presidents of the teams in the country's top baseball league have agreed to expand video replay starting in the second half of the season, officials said on 8 July. Currently, the KBO umpires rely on video replay for disputed home run calls only. The instant replay coverage on home runs was introduced in 2009. Under the present KBO rules, umpires' decisions on safe-out and fair-foul calls are final and managers or coaches may not protest those calls. The league's umpires, though, have been on the hot seat for most of this season with some high-profile missed calls. With every KBO game broadcast live on cable television and available for free streaming online for domestic viewers, and with improved technology breaking down disputed plays from multiple angles, umpires also work under heavier scrutiny than in the past.\nBefore this season, the KBO brass had said the league would conduct feasibility studies on expanded video review and that it would consider making the move by as early as 2015. At their meeting in May, the league's general managers discussed expanding video replay but decided to put the issue on hold until the end of this season, citing technical difficulties.\nWith the pressure mounting to make changes, though, the KBO team presidents caved in and agreed to expand the replay in the second half, which begins on 22 July following the All-Star break. The KBO said it will convene its rules committee to revise the rule book, and settle on specifics of the expansion in a meeting of field managers ahead of the All-Star Game on 18 July. Before this season, Major League Baseball (MLB) decided to expand its review process to cover fair-foul calls and force play at bases, among other categories.\nAll-Star Game.\nOn 18 July, the best players participated in the Korean All-Star Game. The franchises participating were divided into two regions: Eastern League Team (Samsung Lions, Doosan Bears, Lotte Giants, SK Wyverns) and Western League Team (Kia Tigers, Hanwha Eagles, LG Twins, Nexen Heroes, NC Dinos). The titles 'Eastern' and 'Western' do not directly correspond to the geographical regions of the franchises involved, as both SK and Doosan, being from Incheon and Seoul respectively, are based in the Western region of Korea, despite representing the East. Unlike in Major League Baseball, the Korean All-Star Game does not determine home-field advantage in the Korean Series. The game was played at Gwangju-Kia Champions Field and won 13-2 by Western League Team on 18 July 2014.\nPostseason.\nKorea Professional Baseball season culminates in its championship series, known as the Korean Series. Currently, the top four teams qualify for the postseason based on win–loss records. The team with the best record gains a direct entry into the Korean Series, while the other three teams compete for the remaining place in a step-ladder playoff system:\nForeign hitters.\nEach team could have signed up to three foreign players. Due to the high proportion of pitchers signed in previous years, and there being no foreign hitters at all in 2012–2013, beginning in 2014 the league mandated that at least one of the foreign players must be a position player.\nAverage home attendances.\nSource:"

        "text": "Mike \"Shep\" Sheppard Sr. (April 12, 1936 – April 6, 2019) was an American college baseball coach, mainly as the head coach at Seton Hall from 1973 to 2000 and 2002 to 2003. In 30 seasons as head coach, he led Seton Hall to 10 NCAA tournaments and two College World Series. He had an overall record of 998-540-11.\nCoaching career.\nAfter playing for Ownie Carroll at Seton Hall, Sheppard coached high school baseball. He became the head coach at Seton Hall after Carroll retired at the end of the 1972 season.\nIn Sheppard's first seven seasons (1973–1979), the Pirates played in six NCAA tournaments and two College World Series. The team went 22–8 in his first season. It reached the District 2 Regional, where it lost consecutive games to Penn State and Temple. In 1974, Seton Hall went 3–0 in the District 2 Regional to reach the College World Series, where it lost to Southern Illinois, 5–1, and Texas, 12–2. In 1975, the team returned to the College World Series, where it went 1–2 with an elimination-game win over Florida State. The Pirates also qualified for NCAA tournaments in 1976, 1977, and 1979, reaching the Northeast Regional final against Maine in 1976. Future major leaguers Rick Cerone and Dan Morogiello played for Sheppard during the 1970s.\nSeton Hall appeared in the NCAA tournament three more times in the 1980s (1982, 1984, and 1987). Their deepest run came in 1984, when they again lost to Maine in the Northeast Regional final. The program began competing the Big East Conference in 1985. In its first six seasons in the conference (1985–1990), it won the South Division five times and played in the Big East tournament five times. It won the tournament in 1987. Sheppard was named Big East Coach of the Year in 1985, 1987, and 1989. Several notable players played for Sheppard in the 1980s: John Morris, Tony DeFrancesco, Pat Pacillo, Rich Scheid, Craig Biggio, John Valentin, Kevin Morton, and Mo Vaughn.\nIn the 1990s, Seton Hall won a regular-season conference championship in 1990 and was placed second multiple times but failed to qualify for an NCAA tournament. Its highest win total came in 1995, when the team went 38–16. Future major leaguers Mike Moriarty, Matt Morris, and Jason Grilli played for Sheppard during the decade.\nIn 2000, Seton Hall returned to the NCAA tournament. The Pirates went 36–14 in the regular season. They lost in the Big East championship game, but received an at-large bid to the 2000 NCAA tournament. As the third seed in the Columbia Regional, they went 0–2, losing games to second-seeded Wake Forest and fourth-seeded Liberty.\nSheppard missed the entire 2001 season while recovering from triple-bypass surgery. His son, Rob, served as interim coach during the season.\nSheppard returned for two seasons but resigned following the 2003 season in controversial circumstances. In March 2003, Steve Politi of the Newark Star-Ledger published an article in which former players and their parents accused Sheppard, an ex-Marine, of using harsh punishments and racial slurs. Others, including other Former players, fellow coaches, and media members, defended Sheppard and argued there was no proof of such behavior. Seton Hall conducted a confidential investigation of the incident, the results of which were not published. Sheppard resigned in summer 2003; the university's press release about his resignation cited \"health reasons and a desire to spend more time with his children and grandchildren.\" Including games during the 2001, when his son Rob served as interim head coach, Sheppard retired with 998 career victories. Rob served as Seton Hall's interim head coach in 2004 before being named to the position permanently for the 2005 season.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Sheppard's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach.\nPersonal.\nThree of Sheppard's sons are also baseball coaches. Rob replaced him as Seton Hall's head coach, and Mike Jr. and John are high school baseball coaches. His son-in-law, Ed Blankmeyer, is the manager of the Brooklyn Cyclones.\nSheppard is an inductee of the Newark Athletic Hall of Fame (1988) and American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame (2011).\nSeton Hall's softball venue is named for Sheppard, who died on April 6, 2019, six days before his 83rd birthday."

        "title": "Hunters Hill Rugby Club",
        "text": "The Hunters Hill Rugby Club, is an Australian amateur rugby union club based in Hunters Hill, New South Wales. The club currently fields six teams in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union competition, known as \"Subbies\". Hunters Hill was formed in 1892, and is amongst the oldest rugby clubs in Australia.\nThe club aims to achieve a balance of success and camaraderie on and off the field as well as encouraging people all of ages and genders to enjoy their rugby. As of 2017, Hunters Hill has won twelve Club Championships and forty one Premierships within the various divisions of the Subbies competition, including winning the trophy for the Division I premiership, the Kentwell Cup, eight times.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1892–1914.\nHunters Hill RUFC was founded in 1892. Sydney club rugby in the early years was organised on two levels, known simply as Senior and Junior, where Junior denoted second tier teams, not the age of the players. A Senior club competition had been running since 1874, but Junior contests prior to the mid-1880s were somewhat disorganised. There was no formal competition for 'Junior' clubs until 1886 and \nmatches were agreed by arrangement of the clubs (or between schools and clubs).\nThe City and Suburban Association, formed in 1901, organised a competition for Junior clubs outside the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan and New South Wales Rugby Unions, and the Hunters Hill club joined this competition from at least as early as 1906. The club's present black and white hoops were adopted in 1907 but colours of dark blue and sky blue were used from the mid-1890s.\nSubbies: 1919–1956.\nFollowing the re-establishment of New South Wales rugby in 1919 after the war, a new combined competition formed. Hunters Hill won the premiership for non-district clubs in 1919. At the beginning of the 1923 season, W.H. Kentwell, president of the Mosman Rugby Club, presented the Kentwell Cup perpetual trophy for what was effectively the first grade competition of the non-district clubs at the time. Eight teams competed in 1923 and the cup was won by Mosman with Hunters Hill as the runners-up. Hunters Hill played the finals in 1930 and 1932, and again in 1938 – but were not to win the Kentwell Cup until 1972. The club did however win the second grade finals of 1925 and 1926 for the G.B. Burke Cup.\nAfter the war, Hunters Hill won the G.B. Burke Cup again in 1955. The club won the H.W. Whiddon Cup for the third grade competition, in 1949, 1951, and 1955. The club fell away, however, and no senior rugby sides were fielded for nine seasons from 1957. Outside of the World Wars this was the senior club's only break of continuity, but the junior club had remained strong with up to ten teams playing.\nComeback and Golden era: 1966–1991.\nIn 1966, Hunters Hill made a return to Subbies and over the next six years expanded from one senior team to three. The club won the Division II first grade in 1971 for the John Barraclough Cup (as well as the Reliance Shield club championship) and fielded four teams after promotion to Division I in 1972. Coached by former the NSW and Wallaby player John Francis, the club achieved immediate success by winning the Division I first grade premiership in 1972 for the Kentwell Cup.\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, Hunters Hill had a golden period in Division I, securing Kentwell Cup victories in 1972, 1977–79, 1981, and 1987. The club won the Bruce Graham Shield four times for the Division I Club Championship in 1977, 1979–81, and 1987. Eventually the club was relegated to Division II in 1991.\nCentenary and regrowth: 1992 to 2010.\nHunter's Hill undertook a recruitment drive to boost playing members ahead of the Club's centenary in 1992. In that season, the first grade team wore jerseys which incorporated the two blue colours from the 1900s. The Hunters Hill club also travelled to the Hong Kong Sevens tournament. In 1994, \"The Cats\" team for over-35s was formed. The club gained promotion to Division I for the 1995 season. A colts team was also formed in 1995, and the club entered and won the NSW Sevens tournament. The Hunters Hill club moved up and down between divisions. The 1st Grade side tasted success in 1995 and 1997, winning the Division I 'Kentwell Cup'.\nRecent times: 2010 to present.\nIn 2011, Hunters Hill won the interdivisional Cowboy Cup, as well as the Division II Club Champions Reliance Shield and first grade John Barraclough Cup, to gain promotion once again to Division I in 2012.\nIn 2016, Hunters Hill won the Subbies 7's Tournament, beating Blacktown 15–5 in the final, before claiming the Barraclough Cup once again as the first grade premiers in Division II.\n2017 saw all four senior grades participate in the finals, with 1st grade and 3rd grade claiming the minor premierships. Hunter's Hill was awarded the Division II Club Champions Reliance Shield. This success has provided Hunters Hill promotion to Tier I for the 2018 season.\nNSW Suburban Rugby Union Premierships.\nHunters Hill has won club championship and premiership titles across multiple competitions since 1919:\nPremierships.\nDivision III.\nNSWRU: Reserve Grade B division\nSubbies Preseason 7s.\nNotes:\nNotable players.\nHunters Hill players who have gone on to gain international or provincial caps:"

        "text": "The JUCO World Series is an annual baseball tournament held across three divisions of National Junior College Athletic Association baseball. Taking place in late May and early June each year, it determines the junior college baseball national champions. The first year in which the World Series was played across three separate divisions was 1993.\nNJCAA playoff format.\nThe NJCAA baseball playoff format for reaching the JUCO World Series is generally the same for all divisions, regions, and districts with few exceptions. The postseason begins with a Region Sectional. This is a best-of-three series against another team from the region. Oftentimes the top eight seeds in a given region will be seeded one through eight. With this being the case, the number one team would face the number eight seed in the first round and so on. The four winners of these opening round series then advance to the Region Championship. The Region Championship is a four team double elimination tournament that determines the winners of each of the NJCAA's twenty-four regions. Each of the Region Champions then advances to the District Championship. The District Championship is generally a three-game series contested between two region champions to determine who receives that district's bid to the JUCO World Series. In Divisions I and II, the ten district champions continue on to the JUCO World Series where a double elimination tournament decides that year's national champion. In Division III, the seven district champions plus an at-large selection, a runner-up from one of the district championships, reach the JUCO World Series and play a double elimination tournament to determine the national champion.\nDivision I College World Series.\nSince 1977, the champion of each of the NJCAA's ten regionally defined districts advance to the event. It is held as a ten team, double-elimination tournament. Several different brackets and schedules have been used since the event began in 1958. In the first season, the event was an eight-team bracket leading to placement, with the winners of their first two games playing for the championship, while others played for respective places. In 1959, the NJCAA adopted the double-elimination format. In 1977, the event expanded to ten teams, and has remained so ever since. The Division I College World Series is held annually in Grand Junction, Colorado at Sam Suplizio Field.\nDivision II College World Series.\nThe NJCAA Division II College World Series is held annually in Enid, Oklahoma at David Allen Memorial Ballpark. The World Series was previously held in Millington, Tennessee from 1993 until 2008. It has remained in Enid, Oklahoma since 2009. The Division II tournament is a double elimination tournament contested by the ten district champions. The Division II format is largely the same as the Division I tournament, being that there are ten teams competing for the national championship in a double elimination format.\nDivision III College World Series.\nThe NJCAA Division III College World Series is held annually in Greeneville, Tennessee at Pioneer Park. The Division III World Series was originally held in Jamestown, New York from 1993-1994. It then moved to Batavia, New York from 1995-2004 before moving again to Glens Falls, New York for the 2005-2006 seasons. It was held in Tyler, Texas from 2007-2014. It changed sites once again for the 2015-2016 seasons when Kinston, North Carolina hosted. The World Series has been held in Greeneville, Tennessee since 2017. The double elimination tournament pits the seven district champions plus an at-large selection against each other to determine the NJCAA Division III baseball national champion. Unlike the Division I and II tournaments, there are only seven districts in Division III, rather than ten. This allows for a non-district champion to reach the finals with an at-large bid to round out the tournament at a more even eight teams."

The race would be held in conjunction with the Tour de France, with the first edition taking place as a one-day race on the Champs-Élysées in advance of the final stage of the men's race. The race was welcomed by the professional peloton and the media, with Vos stating that the race would be a \"fantastic showcase after last year's [World Championships] and the 2012 Olympics\".\nIn subsequent years, the race took place in a variety of locations such as Pau, Col de la Colombière and Col d'Izoard in conjunction with the men's race, as the ASO argued that this was the \"best way to shine a light on female cycling\". The race was initially praised for the exposure gained by 'sharing the stage' with the Tour de France, with sponsors welcoming the visibility of the Champs-Élysées, and live TV coverage in conjunction with the Tour de France.\nCriticism.\nHowever, the races were criticised by riders, teams and the media. Some felt that the race was an 'after thought' and were overshadowed by the men's race. ASO were criticised for not doing enough to promote the race. The 2017 edition was specifically criticised for a lack of facilities for riders and teams, no support to get from the Col d'Izoard to Marseille, as well as issues regarding the pursuit time trial format in Marseille. Riders noted that the stages weren't hard enough for the professional peloton, with former cyclist &amp; commentator Joanna Rowsell stating that \"We need mountain climbs, flat stages, time trials and a Champs-Elysees finish\". \nThe race was also criticised for not being a \"full Tour de France\", with campaigner Kathryn Bertine stating her disappointment that the race had not evolved into a multi day stage race. Pushing back on criticism, ASO stated that logistical issues mean that a men's and women's Tour de France would not be able to be staged simultaneously, and that any race must be financially sustainable.\nReplacement by Tour de France Femmes.\nIn June 2021, ASO announced that the Tour de France Femmes - a multi day stage race - will take place for the first time in 2022. This new 8 day race took place following the Tour de France, replacing La Course.\nWinners.\nA total of six of the eight editions were won by cyclists from the Netherlands."

        "title": "Kevin Cooney (baseball)",
        "text": "Kevin Cooney (born August 12, 1950) is an American former college baseball coach who was the head coach at Montclair State from 1984–1987 and Florida Atlantic from 1988–2008. Under Cooney, the teams combined to appear in 11 NCAA tournaments, including six in Division I. Montclair State won the Division III National Championship in 1987. Individually, Cooney was named the TAAC Coach of the Year in 1999.\nPlaying career.\nA New Jersey native, Cooney attended Montclair State University in Montclair, New Jersey. He played baseball for the Red Hawks from 1970–1972. A pitcher, Cooney had a career 18-3 record, 2.35 ERA, and 164 strikeouts. In 1972, his final season at Montclair, the program appeared in its first NCAA tournament, finishing third in the East Regional. Following the season, the Minnesota Twins selected him in the 11th round of the MLB Draft.\nCooney played two professional seasons, advancing as high as Class A Wisconsin Rapids before a shoulder injury ended his playing career. Over the two seasons, Cooney compiled a 19-11 record and a 3.43 ERA.\nCoaching career.\nMontclair State.\nFollowing his playing career, Cooney returned to Montclair State as an assistant under Clary Anderson, whom he had played for a few years earlier. Cooney worked as an assistant from 1975–1976. The Red Hawks made the NCAA tournament in both seasons. Anderson left to become the head coach at Fairleigh Dickinson after the 1976 season; Cooney also left Montclair and worked as a high school teacher and coach in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nWhen Montclair's next head coach, Fred Hill, left for Rutgers following the 1983 season, Cooney returned as the Red Hawks' head coach. In Cooney's four seasons at Montclair (1984–1987), the Red Hawks went 138-50-2, reached four Division III College World Series, and won the 1987 national championship. In 1987, the team went 3-0 to win its regional, defeating North Adams State, 11-5, and Upsala, 17-2 and 16-15 in 10 innings. At that year's College World Series, Montclair went 4-0 with two extra inning wins to win the title. It beat Eastern Connecticut, UC San Diego, and UW-Oshkosh to advance to the championship game, where it defeated Oshkosh, 13-12 in 10 innings.\nDuring Cooney's stint at Montclair, three players were selected in the Major League Baseball Draft, including seventh-round selection Dan Olsson in 1985.\nFlorida Atlantic.\nDivision II.\nPrior to the 1988 season, Division II Florida Atlantic (FAU) hired Cooney to replace Steve Traylor, who had left to become the head coach at Duke. Cooney held the position for 21 seasons, leading FAU to Division I, seven NCAA tournaments, and a 742-480-5 overall record.\nFor Cooney's first six seasons, 1988–1993, FAU played as an independent school in Division II, though its schedule included a mix of Division I and Division II teams. In 1991, Cooney hired John McCormack, who would remain with the program as an assistant through the end of Cooney's tenure. He also opened the FAU Baseball Stadium in 1991. The Blue Wave's best season during this stretch was 1993, when it went 41-17 and reached an NCAA Regional championship game.\nDivision I.\nFor the 1994 season, FAU transitioned to Division I, joining the Trans America Athletic Conference.\nAfter being ineligible for the postseason in 1994, the program made its first Division I postseason in 1995, finishing fourth in the TAAC to qualify for the TAAC Tournament. As the fourth seed, the Blue Wave won their first game against top-seeded FIU, then lost consecutive games to Stetson and UCF and was eliminated.\nFAU reached its first Division I tournament in 1999, one of its best seasons under Cooney. It went 51-5 in the regular season; the season included a 34-game win streak from February to April that tied Texas's NCAA record. Pitcher Todd Moser was named the A-Sun Player of the Year. At the TAAC Tournament at Osceola County Stadium, the Blue Wave went 1-2 but qualified for the NCAA tournament with an at-large bid. At the Coral Gables Regional, the team lost its opener to FIU, then defeated Bethune-Cookman and FIU before losing to host Miami in the regional championship.\nThe Blue Wave returned to the NCAA tournament in 2000, then made their deepest postseason run under Cooney in 2002. After a 40-15 regular season in which they placed second in the A-Sun, the Blue Wave went 3-2 at the A-Sun Tournament, losing to top-seeded UCF in the title game. They were then awarded an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the third seed in the Tuscaloosa Regional. Both lower seeds won their regional openers (FAU 16-11 over Auburn), setting up a 1-0 game with Southeast Missouri State that FAU won to reach the regional championship round. There, they lost one game to host Alabama, 7-2, but defeated the Crimson Tide in the decisive seventh game to advance to the best-of-three super regional round. In the Atlanta Super Regional, Georgia Tech swept the Blue Wave in two games.\nThe 2002 appearance was the first of four consecutive NCAA tournaments for the program, but it did not advance past the regionals in 2003, 2004, or 2005. (Of Cooney's six Division I Tournament appearances at FAU, 2002 was the only year in which the Blue Wave were not placed at the Coral Gables Regional, hosted by nearby Miami.) In 2004, FAU won its only A-Sun Tournament under Cooney; Rusty Brown was named the tournament MVP.\nDuring Cooney's 21 seasons at FAU, the program had 58 selections in the Major League Baseball Draft. The highest was Jeff Fiorentino, a future Major Leaguer selected 79th overall in 2004. Other of Cooney's players to appear in Major League Baseball were Tim Harikkala, Carmen Cali, Tommy Murphy, Michael Crotta, Mickey Storey, and Jeff Beliveau.\nFAU moved to the Sun Belt Conference for Cooney's final two seasons (2007–2008). The Owls (renamed following the 2005 season) had two 30-win seasons and made two Sun Belt tournaments, but did not qualify for the NCAA tournament in either season. Following the 2008 season, Cooney announced his retirement.\nHead coaching record.\nThe following is a table of Cooney's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach.\nPersonal.\nCooney has four children. His oldest son, Jim, pitched for Cooney from 1999–2002, was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, and played three years of professional baseball.\nSince retiring from coaching, Cooney has moved to Sweetwater, Tennessee and started business ventures in farming, antiques, and Christmas tree growing.\nIn 2012, Cooney was inducted into the FAU Hall of Fame."

Only two players have scored in two consecutive FIFA World Cup finals: Vavá and Mbappé. Only two scorers, Pelé and Mbappé, have scored in a final goal as teenagers. Mbappé is also the only player to score multiple goals in a losing final.\nESPN featured a documentary on the 34 finals goalscorers who were alive before the 2010 final."

The overall games and transport concept were considered excellent, as many venues were already homologated by the FIS, and the competitions would have been staged in two main zones one an hour by road from the other, or just 40 minutes by train. The airport is located just 15 minutes away. Other issues rated favorably were: a single Olympic Village which would form part of an urban development project on the lakeside, excellent facilities planned for the media, and US$780 million budget guaranteed by the Swedish government.\nHowever, the evaluation report listed some problems that might have occurred. The ski jumps were planned to be constructed, but the amount of space reserved for seating would have to be reviewed, as the commission deemed it inadequate to cope with 40,000 spectators. Environmental impact assessment had not been carried out for several sport venues and the site chosen for bob and luge track was in a residential area, which might have caused problems with access and spectator capacity.\nAftermath.\nDuring the 104th IOC meeting held in Budapest the bid got 14 votes and lost in the first round to Salt Lake City."

        "text": "The 2015 Australian Open was a tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park from 19 January to 1 February 2015. It was the 103rd edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam tournament of the year.\nStan Wawrinka was the defending champion in men's singles but lost to four-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. Reigning women's champion Li Na did not defend her title, as she retired from professional tennis in September, 2014. Novak Djokovic won an Open Era record fifth men's singles crown by defeating Andy Murray in the final, and this was the third time they met each other in the final. Serena Williams won an Open Era record six women's singles championships by defeating Maria Sharapova in the final, and this was the second time they met each other in the final.\nSimone Bolelli and Fabio Fognini teamed up to win the men's doubles title for the first time over the team of Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut. Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Lucie Šafářová teamed up to win the women's doubles crown for the first time over the team of Chan Yung-jan and Zheng Jie. Martina Hingis and Leander Paes teamed up to win the mixed doubles title, it was the second for Hingis and third for Paes, over the defending champions Kristina Mladenovic and Daniel Nestor.\nTournament.\nThe 2015 Australian Open was the 103rd edition of the tournament and was held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nThe tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2015 ATP World Tour and the 2015 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which was part of the Grade A category of tournaments, and also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place over a series of 16 courts with Plexicushion surface, including the three main showcourts – Rod Laver Arena, Hisense Arena and Margaret Court Arena. The latter was unveiled with a capacity increase from 6,000 to 7,500 and also as the third Melbourne Park venue with fully operational retractable roof to make the Australian Open the first Grand Slam tournament with three such tennis stadiums. Partly due to the new roof, the 2015 event set an all-time attendance record of 703,899 fans. The cooler than normal temperatures may also have played a role.\nBroadcast.\nThe tournament was broadcast in more than 200 countries around the world. In Australia, all matches were broadcast live by the Seven Network on the network's primary channel under the banner Seven Sport. In the Asia/Pacific region, the tournament was covered by CCTV, iQiyi, SMG (China), Fiji One (Fiji), Sony SIX (India), Wowow, NHK (Japan), Sky TV (New Zealand) and Fox Sports Asia, in Europe by Eurosport, NOS (Netherlands), SRG SSR (Switzerland) and BBC (United Kingdom), in the Middle East by beIN Sports, in Africa by SuperSport, while in the Americas coverage was provided by ESPN.\nIn 2015, live coverage emanated from all sixteen courts. Qualifying tournaments, draw ceremony and Kids' Day were shown on official tournament website, AusOpen.com.\nControversy.\nFollowing a second round victory in Women's singles Canadian Eugenie Bouchard was approached by an interviewer, Ian Cohen, who cited tweets made by Bouchard the previous evening which complimented fellow competitor Serena Williams's on court attire. The interviewer, explaining that Williams \"was kind enough to give us a twirl\", asked Bouchard to offer her own twirl. Though Bouchard obliged, the request was met with criticism, with many accusing the interviewer of being sexist. The controversy was referred to by some media outlets as \"twirlgate.\" Billie Jean King responded to the interview by saying \"This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well.\" For her part, Bouchard said the request would not be sexist if men were asked to \"flex their muscles and stuff.\" At least one media outlet pointed out that as part of a pre-tournament interview Rafael Nadal was asked to take off his shirt for the enjoyment of female fans.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Australian Open total prize money for 2015 was increased to A$40,000,000, with men's and women's singles champions to receive a tournament-record 3.1 million Australian dollars reward. Out of total prize money, A$28,796,000 was paid for players competing in singles main draw, further A$1,344,000 for players, who lost in qualifying, A$5,165,200 – for doubles players, A$480,000 for mixed doubles players and A$605,330 for competitors in other events, while A$3,609,470 was used to cover other fees, including players' per diem and trophies.\n1Qualifiers prize money is also the Round of 128 prize money.\nSingles players.\n2015 Australian Open – Men's singles\nEvents.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\nThis was the third time these two players met in the final. The other two times were in 2011 and 2013, when Djokovic won. This time would prove no different with Djokovic winning his fifth title, an Open Era record, to go along with his titles in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013. This victory was Djokovic's eighth grand slam title, tying him in the Open Era with Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi. This was Murray's fourth loss in the final of the Australian Open, three of them to Djokovic and one to Roger Federer in 2010. This marks the first time since Björn Borg at the US Open that someone has lost all four of his final appearances at a particular grand slam event.\nWomen's singles.\nThis marked the second time these two players met in the final. The other time was in 2007, which Williams won. This time would be exactly the same, with Williams winning her sixth title (an Open Era record), to go along with wins in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2010. This was her nineteenth career grand slam singles title, behind only Steffi Graf's twenty-two titles in the Open Era of tennis. This was Sharapova's third loss in the final; the other two losses were in 2012 to Victoria Azarenka and to Williams in 2007. Sharapova won the title in 2008.\nMen's doubles.\nThis was the first men's doubles title for the team of Bolelli and Fognini at the event and in their respective careers.\nWomen's doubles.\nThis was the first women's doubles title for the team of Mattek-Sands and Šafářová at the event and in their respective careers. One of their finalist opponents, Zheng Jie won the title in 2006 with Yan Zi.\nMixed doubles.\nThis was a match of past mixed doubles champions at the event, which Hingis won with Mahesh Bhupathi in 2006, while her partner Paes won titles in 2003 with Martina Navratilova and in 2010 with Cara Black. Their finalist opponents' won the event last year, but Nestor won titles in 2007 with Elena Likhovtseva and 2011 with Katarina Srebotnik. This was Hingis' second mixed doubles title for her career, and for Paes' it is his seventh mixed doubles grand slam crown for his career.\nSingles seeds.\nSeedings are based on rankings as of 12 January 2015. Rankings and points before are as of 19 January 2015.\nPoints defending includes results from both the 2014 Australian Open and tournaments from the week of 27 January 2014 (Davis Cup for the men, and Paris and Pattaya for the women).\nMen's singles.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but they withdrew from the event.\n†The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2014.

The 1928–29 season was a culmination of the entire decade in which the school revolutionized a fast break offense coupled with high-pressure defense, something that no other teams had ever done.

        "text": "Scott Kevin Barrett (born 20 November 1993) is a New Zealand professional rugby union player who currently plays as a lock for the in Super Rugby and Taranaki in the Mitre 10 Cup. Barrett was chosen as the Crusaders' Captain for the 2020 Super Rugby season.\nBarrett was first selected for New Zealand's international team, the All Blacks, in 2016 and has played over 60 tests for New Zealand since his debut against Ireland.\nEarly life.\nRaised in a rugby household, where older brothers Beauden and Kane, as well as younger brother Jordie, also went on to become professional rugby players, Scott Barrett cut his teeth playing for Francis Douglas Memorial College in his native New Plymouth. Barrett's older brother Beauden and younger brother Jordie are his current All Black team-mates.\nPlaying career.\nEarly career.\nBarrett was a member of the New Zealand Under 20 team which participated in the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship in France, where he made 3 appearances in total.\nBarrett got his big break in June 2014 when he was named in a Crusaders side shorn of its international players who played a midweek match against the touring national team. The result did not turn out as Barrett would have liked, however when the Super Rugby season resumed following the mid-year internationals he gained his first full cap for the Crusaders. Injuries to international second-row forwards Sam Whitelock and Luke Romano saw Barrett named on the replacements bench for the match against the on 5 July 2014. He came on as a 74th minute replacement for Jimmy Tupou in a 21–13 win for his side.\n2016–2017.\nScott Barrett made his debut for the All Blacks squad against Ireland on 5 November 2016 in Chicago. Barrett came on as a substitute early in the second half for Jerome Kaino who had been selected to unusually start at lock following injury to Sam Whitelock and Brodie Retallick, as well as Luke Romano returning home due to family bereavement. Barrett scored his first international try during that match, with the try converted by his older brother Beauden. The match was a historic loss to Ireland, the final score 40–29.\nBarrett earned a start the following week against Italy, coming off the bench again for victories against Ireland and France. Barrett was the only All Black to play in all four tests on the 2016 end-of-year tour, a milestone for him as he had never been capped prior to the tour.\nBarrett had become a regular starter for the Crusaders by 2017, replacing Luke Romano as newly-appointed captain Sam Whitelock's locking partner, with Romano shifting to a regular bench spot for the 2017 season. Barrett missed the 3–12 loss against the touring British and Irish Lions for the Crusaders due to injury but recovered to start for them in all three of the knockout rounds of the 2017 season, being a part of the 2017 Super Rugby Final winning Crusaders side who beat the Lions 25-17 in Johannesburg on 5 August.\nBarrett has not missed selection for New Zealand since his debut, and was selected for the 33-man squad for the Pasifika Challenge against Samoa and the British and Irish Lions test series in mid-2017 alongside brothers Beauden and Jordie.\nBarrett carried a heavy workload for the All Blacks in 2017 and he came off the bench in all three tests against the British and Irish Lions in the 2017 drawn series, but unfortunately only played a total of 15 minutes during the series due to the dominant play of Whitelock and Retallick.\nBarrett returned to action after missing the first Bledisloe Cup test and replaced blindside flanker Liam Squire off the bench in the second of the series. Barrett only touched the ball once in the whole test, but used it to set his older brother up for the winning try. Barrett had a world-class impact off the bench against South Africa on 19 September. He joined the side of the scrum at blindside flanker after Squire was concussed in the 27th minute, scoring his second test try in the 57–0 win. Barrett was subsequently chosen to start in round 4 and 5 of the 2017 Rugby Championship against Argentina and South Africa, playing well in both, staying on the field for the full 80 minutes against Argentina. Barrett started another two times that year, against Australia and against the Barbarians due to Retallick not playing rugby for the rest of 2017 due to personal reasons. Barrett went back to his regular role on the bench against France, a French XV and against Wales on the 2017 end-of-year tour, having made 14 appearances for the All Blacks after the season finished, including every single test but two.\n2018.\nOn 9 June 2018, in Brodie Retallick's continued absence, Scott Barrett joined Beauden and Jordie in the starting lineup in the first of three tests against France, becoming the first family to have 3 brothers in the starting lineup. Barrett played the full 80 minutes of the first test against France, with the All Blacks winning 52–11. Following good performances from all three Barrett brothers in the first test of the series, the trio started against France in the second test as well. Barrett played the full 80 minutes of the second test as well, with his younger brother Jordie winning Man of the Match as the All Blacks won 26–13.\nOn 23 June 2018, Barrett was the best performing All Black on the field, against France, in the third test of the series. Barrett finished off the Steinlager series by winning the award for Man of the Match, after an outstanding defensive performance, as the All Blacks won against France 49–14. He went the whole series without being subbed off, a rare feat for a player of his experience.\nIn the first two rounds of the 2018 Rugby Championship, Barrett was replaced as a starter, upon Retallick's much-anticipated return to international rugby. In the third test of the competition, Barrett was given the chance to start alongside Retallick, who was then injured again, in a 46–24 win over Argentina. Barrett then went on to start in all three remaining tests of the Championship, which included a shock 34-36 loss to South Africa's Springboks. The final test of the competition, also against South Africa, saw Barrett score his fourth try, in the dying minutes of the test. Late tries to Barrett and Ardie Savea, saw Barrett's Crusaders teammate, Richie Mo'unga, kick the winning conversion, ending the test with a narrow 32–30 win for New Zealand.\nBarrett played in all four tests of New Zealand's end-of-season tour, finishing his year by starting in half of them.\n2019.\nAfter a good 2019 Super Rugby season, Barrett returned from injury to the All Blacks prior to the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Barrett, who was short of match fitness, was immediately named to start in his first test for 2019, with Brodie Retallick's continued injury troubles enabling Barrett to keep his place as a regular starter among the All Blacks. In the test, against Australia, Barrett performed poorly in the first half. Barrett's performance ended after only 39 minutes, after he was controversially red-carded for a shoulder charge to the neck of Australian Captain, Michael Hooper. Barrett became only the fourth New Zealander in the history of international rugby to be sent off during a test, joining team mate Sonny Bill Williams, amongst others. New Zealand was losing by 12–13 when Barrett was sent off, finishing the match with their worst defeat in history, 26–47. Barrett was subsequently suspended from playing for three weeks. Barrett returned to play for a 92–0 win over Tonga, although Patrick Tuipulotu was picked over him as a starter.\nOn 28 August, All Blacks Head Coach, Steve Hansen named Barrett, as well as both of his brothers, amongst the 31 players in New Zealand's squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nBarrett played in two tests during the World Cup's pool stages. A start against Canada saw the Barretts become the first trio of brothers to start for New Zealand in a World Cup match, and the first to all start in a World Cup match since Elisi Vunipola, Manu Vunipola, and Fe'ao Vunipola all played for Tonga in 1995. The Barrett brothers also became the first trio of brothers to all score a try in the same match, with Canada losing 63–0.\nAlthough Barrett was benched for Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock for the quarter-final, against Ireland, he supplanted Sam Cane in the starting lineup for the semi-final, against England, confirming his place amongst New Zealand's best players. But with England fielding two openside flankers in their starting lineup, Barrett was subbed off at half-time in the semi-final, with New Zealand eventually losing 7-19. Coach, Steve Hansen went on to admit he made a mistake in starting three locks against England.\nAfter New Zealand finished in third place at the Rugby World Cup, Barrett was named as the Crusaders' Captain for the 2020 Super Rugby season. Barrett was subsequently touted as a future All Black Captain.\nHonours.\nNew Zealand"

        "title": "Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course",
        "text": "The Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course is a public park and a municipal, 18-hole, championship golf course in the southernmost part of Dyker Heights, Brooklyn, in New York City, United States. The area stretches from the Belt Parkway in the south to 86th Street in the north, between 7th Avenue on the west and 14th Avenue on the east.\nThe course totals 217 acres and includes 6,548 yards of golf. Both the park's and the course's roots go back more than 100 years, and it is one of the most played public golf courses in the nation.\nThe golf course is managed by the American Golf Corporation, which not only won the contract to run the majority of New York City courses in 1999 but also renovated and expanded the club house in 2007-2008. Dyker Beach Golf Course is one of the oldest golf courses in the United States and second oldest in New York City, behind Van Cortlandt Park, in the Bronx. The course is open all year round so long as weather conditions allow for play.\nHistory.\nThe park officially dates back to 1895, but its use as public land goes back to the times of the Canarsee Indians and the original New Utrecht Dutch settlers who referred to it as the \"common land.\" The Indians and the Dutch were unable to farm the land or to build houses on it because it was mainly meadows, marsh, and swamps. During the 17th century, the Van Dyke family tried to drain and reclaim this marshy land by building dykes. Thus the origins of the park’s name – after the Van Dyke family who built dykes or the dykes that the Van Dykes built.\nThe park evolved in four stages between 1895 and 1934, from upwards of eight parcels of land. Starting in 1895, the City of Brooklyn secured the first parcel, which stretched from the shore of Gravesend Bay to about 92nd street, and hired the landscape architecture firm of Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot to design a park, to be \"the only seaside park in Greater New York.\" It was to include a saltwater lagoon, children's playgrounds, bathhouses, lawns, and drives along the shore. According to the NYC Parks Department, the 1896 Annual Report of the Brooklyn Parks Department claimed that Dyker Beach Park would be the \"finest seaside park in the world.\" Although bathhouses were erected and roads were constructed, the plans were revised in 1911 by Mr. Charles D. Lay, a former landscape architect for the Park’s Department, who proposed to decrease the size of the lagoon and to add concert groves. In 1918 work began to fill the swampy areas of the park.\nPrior to the 1920s, land stretching from 92nd Street to 86th Street was privately owned. The Dyker Meadow Land and Improvement Company owned the largest parcel and leased the land to both the Dyker Golf Club and Marine and Field Club, who used the Dyker Heights Club House, built in 1898, as their golf club house. In February 1916, the Poly Prep Country Day School, which was moving from 99 Livingston Street in Downtown Brooklyn to Dyker Heights, was unsuccessful in its attempts to purchase this parcel for their new county day school, as they were some $80,000 short. Thus, the land was sold to the NYC Parks Department. However, Parks Commissioner Raymond V. Ingersoll, who had two boys at Poly, offered the school a site on 92nd Street and 7th Avenue, which was donated to the Parks Department by Frederic B. Pratt, the Chairman of the Brooklyn Committee on City Planning. The school graciously accepted the offer and constructed a neo-Georgian school, which still functions today in this same location.\nAccording to the Parks Department, four additional parcels of land were acquired between 1924 and 1927 by assignment and condemnation and another three lots were transferred to the department in 1934, which concluded the expansion of the park. These later expansions unmapped many streets which ran between 92nd and 86th streets, one such street was ‘De Russy Street’ which was built in the 1870s. In 2008, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation agreed to name the circular driveway in front of the Dyker Beach Golf Course Club house in his honor.\nIn 1935, the Club House was constructed, designed by architect John Van Kleek. This building was renovated and expanded in 2008 by American Golf Corporation to house all golf operations as well as a wedding ceremony and reception hall which can accommodate 300 patrons.\nDyker Beach Golf Course was run by the New York City Parks Department until 1984, when operations were turned over to a private operator, American Golf Corporation.\nToday, besides the 18-hole golf course and the catering center, the park has baseball, football, and soccer fields as well as bocce, basketball, handball, and tennis courts.\nUsage of the course.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Dyker Beach Golf Course was the world’s busiest, with over 100,000 rounds played annually.\nIn 1965, a total of 103,581 rounds were played. A golf getaway located in the heart of Brooklyn, it was one of the most played golf courses in the United States in the 1960s, averaging over 350 golfers a day during the season. Many of its golfers are locals who line up early in the morning in order to get a number for a round of golf.\nGolf clubs.\nDyker Beach Park is also home to four golf clubs that play on the course: the Shore View Golf Club, incorporated in 1930, one of the oldest public men's golf clubs in the United States; the Brookridge Ladies Club, also one of the older public golf clubs in the country; the Sand Trappers Senior Golf Club, that plays on Tuesdays and caters to older golfers; and a new club, Dyker Beach Women's Golf Club, that plays on Tuesday and Sunday mornings."

        "text": "The Sélestat Alsace Handball is a French handball club based in Sélestat in Alsace and founded in 1967 under the name Sport Club de Sélestat before taking its current name on September 1, 2008. The club has played 23 seasons in D1 since 1990 and is playing since 2023 in LNH Division 2.\nHistory.\nThe handball section of the Sport Club de Sélestat was created in 1967 by Germain Spatz and was enthusiastically received by young people in Sélestat. Subsequently, this enthusiasm allowed Selestadian handball players to climb all the levels to reach the top of departmental and regional competitions and finally reach in 1972 in the French National Championship 3 (4th national level at that time). Then the team remains 12 seasons at this level, winning in passing the title of champion of France of Nationale 3 in 1979. A season after the accession in 1984 in Nationale 2, the club goes up in Nationale 1B in 1985. Finally, in At the end of an exceptional 1989–1990 season, the club realized its dream by reaching division 1 and managing to stay there. The club entered the French 1st division championship during the 1990–1991 season. In 1995, he reached the final of the Coupe de France but was defeated by OM Vitrolles, which was his best professional result to date. However, the club has won the Coupe d'Alsace 6 times. One of the smallest budgets in the LNH, the Sélestat Alsace Handball is nevertheless renowned as having an excellent training center. It is notably here that Thierry Omeyer, Damien Waeghe, , Baptiste Butto, or even were trained. Often used as a springboard for a future career, the Sélestat Alsace Handball has also enabled many players, today of international class, to make themselves known to the general public or to relaunch their professional careers like the German , Argentinian as well as Tunisians Heykel Megannem and Issam Tej, elected in the purple jersey respectively best center-half in 2005 and best pivot of the French championship in 2005 and 2006. In 2008, the club took its independence by leaving the bosom of the Sport Club de Sélestat to become the Sélestat Alsace Handball (SAHB). Then a major development for the club took place on June 6, 2011, with the creation of SASP Alsace Promo Handball, one of the shareholders and member of the supervisory board of which is Thierry Omeyer, in order to manage the professional sector of the club. Structured in this way, the SAHB aspires to offer Alsace, the East of France and all of its partners a media scene with a European dimension. Relegated to the division at the end of the 2008–2009 season, the club returned to the elite two years later. The club then evolves in the \"soft underbelly\" of the championship, far from both relegation and European places. The club thus finished 7th in 2012 and 8th in 2013, the third and fourth best results for the club in the league. The 2014 offseason marked major changes in the club's sports management since, in contrast to the club's usual stability, eight starts and seven arrivals reshaped the club's workforce. Penultimate at the time of the international break, , club coach since 2008 and whose contract had been extended in the summer of 2014 until June 2016, was sacked on February 2, 2015 and was replaced three more days late by Christian Gaudin. The change is not beneficial since the club finally finished 13th and was relegated to the LNH Division 2 after having played 21 seasons in the elite. If the club immediately returns to the end of the 2015–2016 season, the club fails to maintain its finish by finishing last in 2017 with a record of two wins, one draw and 23 losses. Back in LNH Division 2, he stabilized at this level the following seasons."

The League of Victorian Wheelman (LVW) was first founded in 1893 as a professional cycling body. The Victorian Amateur Cyclists' Union (VACU) was founded in May 1917 to promote the interests of amateur cyclists in Victoria. The VACU would change in name to the Victorian Cycling Federation (VCF) in 1986. The VCF and the LVW merged in 1986 to become Victorian Cycling Incorporated, which was changed to CycleSport Victoria in the 1990s. In 2011 CycleSport Victoria became Cycling Victoria."

        "text": "The 2014 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship as the Gillette Home Run Derby) was a home run hitting contest in Major League Baseball (MLB) between five batters each from the American League and National League. The derby was held on July 14, 2014, at the site of the 2014 MLB All-Star Game, Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Yoenis Céspedes was the winner, repeating his winning performance in 2013 to join Ken Griffey Jr. and Pete Alonso as the only players to win consecutive Home Run Derbies.\nIn June, MLB named José Bautista of the Toronto Blue Jays and Troy Tulowitzki of the Colorado Rockies the Home Run Derby captains. On July 8, 2014, the captains each made their first three picks, while saving their final pick for July 10. Tulowitzki selected Todd Frazier of the Cincinnati Reds, Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins, and would later select his teammate Justin Morneau who played in Minnesota for ten seasons. Bautista selected defending home run derby champion Céspedes of the Oakland Athletics, Brian Dozier of the Minnesota Twins, and Adam Jones of the Baltimore Orioles, and added Oakland's Josh Donaldson as his fifth AL selection.\nRule changes.\nAs announced by Major League Baseball, there were changes to the format of the Home Run Derby in 2014. Five players participated from each league, making ten total participants rather than eight in the past. The batting order for the first round was determined prior to the event, with hitter #1 for the National League hitting first, followed by hitter #1 for the American League, and so on until each participant has batted. Each participant received seven outs, rather than 10 in previous years. The player who hit the most home runs from each league in the first round received a bye to the semifinals. The participants with the second and third most home runs from each league will face each other to determine the second semifinalist. The NL semifinal occurred first followed by the AL semifinal. The semifinal winners from each league competed in the finals to determine the Home Run Derby champion. The batting order for the finals was determined by a coin flip. The flex ball, replacing the golden ball from past years, came into play after 6 outs. A home run hit off of a flex ball resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by Gillette and MLB. Ties in any round were broken by a 3-swing swing-off, and if still needed, sudden-death swings until one player homers and the other does not.\nResults.\nNotes:"

The founding of two clubs Copenhagen RLFC and Jutland RLFC in 2013 enabled domestic games to be played, alongside the Pan Scandinavian League. Although two games are played per year, an aggregate score is not kept, in order to ensure each game remains relevant. The winner of the match becomes the domestic champions.

        "title": "FIFA World Cup top goalscorers",
        "text": "A total of over 2,700 goals have been scored in games at the Men's 22 final tournaments of the FIFA World Cup, not counting penalties scored during shoot-outs. Since the first goal scored by French player Lucien Laurent at the 1930 FIFA World Cup, almost 1,300 footballers have scored goals at the World Cup tournaments, of whom 101 have scored five or more.\nThe top goalscorer of the inaugural competition was Argentina's Guillermo Stábile with eight goals. Since then, only 25 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than Stábile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was Hungary's Sándor Kocsis with eleven in 1954. At the next tournament, France's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil. Germany's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014.\nOf all the players who have played in the World Cup tournaments, only six have achieved an average of two goals or more per game played: Kocsis, Fontaine, Stábile, Russia's Oleg Salenko, Switzerland's Josef Hügi, and Poland's Ernst Wilimowski — the last of these scored four in his single World Cup game in 1938. The top 101 goalscorers have represented 30 nations, with 14 players scoring for Brazil, and another 14 for Germany or West Germany. In total, 67 footballers came from UEFA (Europe), 30 from CONMEBOL (South America), and only four from elsewhere: Cameroon, Ghana, Australia, and the United States.\nFontaine holds the record for the most goals scored in a single tournament, with 13 goals in 1958. The players that came closest were Kocsis in 1954, Müller in 1970 and Portugal's Eusébio in 1966, with 11, 10 and 9, respectively. The lowest scoring top scorer was in 1962, when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 22 tournaments of the World Cup, 31 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Ten of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's Jairzinho and Argentine's Lionel Messi were the only footballers to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of the tournament in 1970 and 2022, respectively. These 31 top goalscorers played for 20 nations, the most (five) for Brazil. Another five came from other South American countries, with the remaining 21 coming from Europe.\nIn 2006, Ronaldo was the first to score 8 goals in knockout matches (excluding 3rd place playoff) at the World Cup in his 3 tournaments for Brazil, tied in 2022 by Kylian Mbappé. Mbappé became the first player to score 4 goals in World Cup finals with his hat-trick in 2022.\nGoalscorers at multiple tournaments.\nCristiano Ronaldo is the only player to have scored in five different World Cups. Four players, Uwe Seeler, Pelé, Miroslav Klose and Lionel Messi, have scored in four tournaments each, while another 35 have scored in three each.\nIn the table below players are listed in order of achieving their tallies."

The incident caused outrage in Pakistan and almost led to the abandonment of the tour, but diplomacy by the MCC president, Lord Alexander, and Iskander Mirza, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, smoothed things over sufficiently to allow the tour to continue."

There were a few occasional professional against amateur challenges as well held in team competition format. The amateur events were almost all all-comers' event and the majority included a mixed title contest. The women's most successful players in the European international championships were Esna Boyd of Australia and two players from the United States Elizabeth Ryan who was thuspunished by the United States Lawn Tennis Association for her commitment to European events compared to those in the U.S. and Helen Wills Moody who won the two most prestigious tournaments in Europe, the French Championships and Wimbledon. The Four Musketeers dominated the rankings and tournaments worldwide. Also the Australian Championships was won by a British player, Colin Gregory.\nThe most important team cups were the Wightman Cup for women and the Davis Cup (called the International Lawn Tennis Challenge) and the Mitre Cup (South American version of the Davis Cup) for men. The 1929 Wightman Cup was its seventh edition and was organized by the United States Lawn Tennis Association between the teams of Great Britain and the United States. The 1929 International Lawn Tennis Challenge was its 24th edition and was organized by the International Tennis Federation. The tournament was split into the American and European zones. The winner of each sub-zone played in an Inter-Zonal Final. 24 teams entered the Europe Zone (including South Africa and Chile), while five nations participated in the America Zone. The United States defeated Cuba in the America Zone, but would then lose to France in the challenge round, giving France their third straight title.

        "text": "Enrique José Hernández González (born August 24, 1991), nicknamed Kike ( ), is a Puerto Rican professional baseball utility player for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has also played in MLB for the Houston Astros, Miami Marlins, and Boston Red Sox.\nThe Astros drafted Hernández in the sixth round of the 2009 MLB draft, and he was called up to the majors for the first time in 2014. He has played every position except catcher in the majors, though he has spent the most time in the outfield and second base. Hernández was a member of the Dodgers' 2020 World Series championship team and won Fielding Bible Awards in 2020 and 2021.\nEarly life.\nHernández is the eldest child of Enrique Hernández Sr., a scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and his wife Mónica González, owner of a boutique in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. His mother is Cuban. He has two younger sisters. He began playing baseball at age six and participated in international youth tournaments in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic.\nHernández attended high school at the American Military Academy in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Though he was tall in his junior year, he grew during his senior year.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Astros.\nThe Houston Astros drafted Hernández in the sixth round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. He earned a $150,000 signing bonus. In 2009, he played primarily second base and third base, and in 2010, he played exclusively second base.\nHernández was called up to the majors for the first time on July 1, 2014. He made his major league debut the same day, entering a game against the Seattle Mariners as a defensive replacement in the seventh inning and collecting two hits, the first of which was a ground-rule double in his first at-bat, off Dominic Leone of the Mariners. Hernández hit his first home run the following day, off Chris Young of the Mariners. In 24 games, he hit .284/.348/.420 for the Astros.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn July 31, 2014, the Astros traded Hernández, Jarred Cosart, and Austin Wates to the Miami Marlins for Jake Marisnick, Colin Moran, Francis Martes, and a compensatory draft pick. Playing for the Marlins on September 26, 2014, Hernández hit a ninth-inning grand slam off Craig Stammen of the Washington Nationals for his first career grand slam in the major leagues. Overall, Hernández appeared in 18 games for the Marlins and batted .175/.267/.425 (seven hits in 40 at bats).\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\n2015–2017.\nOn December 10, 2014, Hernández was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Chris Hatcher, Austin Barnes, and Andrew Heaney, in exchange for Dan Haren, Dee Gordon, Miguel Rojas, and cash. He was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers and was recalled by the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 28, 2015. He was used all over the field, with 20 games at second base, 19 in center field, 17 in left field, 16 at shortstop, 2 in right field and one at third base. In August, Hernández replaced a slumping Joc Pederson as the primary starting center fielder, though he missed much of September with a hamstring strain. He played in 76 games for the team in 2015, batting .307/.346/.490, with seven homers and 22 RBI. In 2015 he led all MLB hitters (60 or more plate appearances) in batting average against left-handers, at .423. During the season, he was known for his sense of humor and for wearing a banana suit in the dugout during games in which he was not playing.\nIn 2016, Hernández was less effective, hitting only .190/.283/.324 with seven homers and 18 RBI in 109 games. He was left off the roster for the first round of the playoffs and was hitless in eight at-bats in the 2016 National League Championship Series.\nIn 2017, he batted .215/.308/.421 in 297 at bats with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs, while playing at least one inning at every position except pitcher or catcher. In the 2017 National League Division Series, he had one hit, a double, in three at-bats. In the fifth game of the 2017 National League Championship Series, he hit three home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in seven runs to tie the record for most RBI in a postseason game, helping send the Dodgers to the World Series for the first time since 1988. In the World Series, he had three hits in 13 at-bats (.231 average) as the Dodgers lost to the Houston Astros in seven games.\n2018–2020.\nHernández was eligible for salary arbitration for the first time after the season, and in January 2018 signed a one-year, $1.6 million contract for 2018.\nOn July 25, 2018, Hernández pitched in a game for the first time in his career, entering in the 16th inning against the Philadelphia Phillies and picking up the loss after walking two batters and giving up a three-run walk-off home run. He is the first position player since Babe Ruth to play in the infield, outfield and give up three runs or more in the same game. He is also the first position player ever to give up a walk-off home run. For the season, he batted .256/.336/.470, hitting a career high 21 home runs and 52 RBIs. In the postseason, he was two for 12 in the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, one for 14 in the NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers and two for 15 in the 2018 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, with one home run.\nOn April 19, 2019, Hernández became the first player to hit a home run off Josh Hader when the count was 0-2. The Milwaukee Brewers pitcher had gone up 0-2 on 82 batters previously and held them to a .049 batting average. On August 22, 2019, Hernandez hit his first career walk-off hit in the team's 3-2 win against the Toronto Blue Jays. He would finish the season batting .237/.304/.411 with 17 home runs and a career-high 62 RBIs.\nPrior to the 2020 season, Hernández agreed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $5.9 million, contract, avoiding arbitration. On July 23, 2020, Hernandez drove in five runs in an Opening Day 8–1 win against the San Francisco Giants. He played in 48 games during the Dodgers' pandemic-shortened 2020 season, hitting .230/.270/.410 with five home runs and 20 RBIs. He was hitless in five at-bats in the 2020 NLDS. In Game 7 of the 2020 National League Championship Series, Hernandez hit a game-tying solo home run in the sixth inning. With the homerun, Hernandez also became the first player to \"pinch\" hit a game-tying or go-ahead home run in a winner-take-all postseason game. Overall, he had 14 at-bats in the series, with four hits (two of them home runs). In the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, Hernandez had two hits in 10 at-bats as the Dodgers won the championship.\nHernández was the last Dodger to wear number 14 before it was retired for Gil Hodges on June 4, 2022.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn February 2, 2021, Hernández signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Boston Red Sox. He began the season as Boston's primary center fielder, while also seeing time at second base. On May 7, Hernández was placed on the 10-day injured list with a right hamstring strain. On May 17, he played for the Worcester Red Sox on a rehabilitation assignment. He hit two home runs in the game, including the first grand slam in the team's history. Hernández returned to Boston's lineup the following day. He was named the AL Player of the Week after hitting .400 with nine RBIs during July 19–25. Hernández missed several games from late August into early September due to being on the COVID-19 related injured list. Overall during the regular season, Hernández played in 134 games for Boston, batting .250 with 20 home runs and 60 RBIs. He also appeared in 11 postseason games, batting 20-for-49 (.408). On October 11, Hernandez hit a sacrifice fly in Game 4 of the ALDS to send the Red Sox to the American League Championship Series. During the final three games of the Division Series and first two games of the League Championship Series, Hernández set a new MLB record for the most total bases in a five-game playoff span, with 34; it also set a new Red Sox franchise record for the most total bases in any five-game span.\nHernández was Boston's starting center fielder for Opening Day in 2022. He missed the game of May 6 due to briefly being on the COVID-related list. On June 8, he was placed on the 10-day injured list due to a right hip flexor strain. On July 23, he was transferred to the 60-day injured list. He rejoined the team on August 16. On September 6, the Red Sox announced that Hernández signed a one-year, $10 million contract extension for the 2023 season. For the 2022 season, Hernández played in 93 games for Boston while batting .222 with six home runs and 45 RBIs.\nPrior to the 2023 season, with longtime shortstop Xander Bogaerts gone, Hernández emerged as a leader in the Red Sox clubhouse. He was involved in recruiting former Dodgers teammates Justin Turner and Kenley Jansen to Boston. With both the departure of Bogaerts, and the injury of Trevor Story, Hernández was named to be the Red Sox starting shortstop come opening day. After 46 games starting on the position, manager Alex Cora announced that the team was moving him off of the position. At the time of the announcement, Hernández led the majors with 14 errors. However, multiple injuries for the Red Sox soon made them move Hernández back to the position, as well as some starts at second base. He played in 86 games for the Red Sox in 2023, batting .222 with 6 home runs and 31 RBI.\nLos Angeles Dodgers (second stint).\nOn July 25, 2023, the Red Sox traded Hernández back to the Dodgers in exchange for Nick Robertson and Justin Hagenman. Hernández returned wearing the number 8, as in the time he was gone, his old number 14 was retired by the Dodgers in honor of Gil Hodges. In 54 games with the Dodgers, he hit .262 with five homers and 30 RBI. He became a free agent following the season and re-signed with the Dodgers on February 26 for a one-year, $4 million contract.\nInternational career.\nHernández played for the Puerto Rico national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, where he won a silver medal.\nOn October 29, 2018, he was selected to form part of the MLB All-Star team for the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series.\nIn October 2022, it was announced that Hernandez would once again represent Team Puerto Rico in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. He batted .300 over Puerto Rico's five games, adding two doubles and four RBI in the tournament.\nPersonal life.\nHernández and his wife, Mariana, married in December 2019 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. They welcomed a daughter in January 2021."

        "text": "The Big East Conference Baseball Coaching Staff of the Year award is presented annually to the conference's most outstanding coaching staff, as voted by the conference's head coaches at the end of each regular season.\nThe award was Big East Conference Baseball Coach of the Year, honoring only the head coach, from the first season of Big East Conference baseball in 1985 through the 2015 season. Starting with the 2016 season, the award was renamed the \"Coaching Staff of the Year\" award, honoring an entire staff. While the \"Big East\" name has been used by two separate conferences—the original Big East, which operated from 1979 to 2013, and the current Big East, formed when the original conference split in 2013—the current Big East claims the baseball history of the original conference. \nThe Big East is the only NCAA Division I baseball conference that presents an annual coaching award to an entire staff instead of only the head coach, although the head coach is cited by name in the award announcement. \nIn 2014 season, Creighton's Ed Servais won the new conference's inaugural award. Creighton had a 30-16 (14-4 Big East) regular season to win the conference title. Since the formation of the current Big East, all but three of the honorees have won at least a share of the conference's regular season title, although the two most recent awards (2022 and 2023) were won by teams that finished outside the top two in the conference. From 1999 to 2006, by contrast, only two regular-season champions won the award.\nEd Blankmeyer of St. John's has won the award a record six times as an individual, and is the only head coach to date to have been part of an honored staff twice. This includes bask-to-back awards twice—individually in 2007 and 2008 and as part of the staff in 2017 and 2018, a feat matched only by his Red Storm predecessor Joe Russo (1990 and 1991) and UConn's Jim Penders (2010 and 2011). Blankmeyer, Penders, and Servais are the only head coaches to have won the award as individuals and as part of an honored staff; Penders has three individual awards and one staff award, while Servais has one of each.\nProvidence is the only school to have three coaches win the award (Don Mezzanotte in 1986, Paul Kostacopoulos in 1995, and Charlie Hickey in 1999). Three other schools had multiple coaches win the award before 2016: St. John's (Russo and Blankmeyer), UConn (Andy Baylock and Penders), and Pittsburgh (Mark Jackson and Joe Jordano).\nWinners.\nBy school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose coaches or coaching staffs have won the award, along with the year each school joined the conference, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so.\nAll years reflect baseball seasons. For schools that joined the Big East after it first sponsored baseball, the first season of play takes place in the calendar year after officially joining the conference."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and as of September 2014 only 42 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at the international level.\nMitchell Johnson—a left-arm fast bowler—is a former Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricketer who represented Australia. Johnson took 264 wickets in Test matches, 212 wickets in ODIs and 38 wickets in T20Is. With 15 five-wicket hauls across all formats of the game, he ranks equal thirty-ninth among all-time combined five-wicket haul takers, and ninth in the equivalent list for Australia.\nJohnson made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in 2007. His first five-wicket haul came against New Zealand during the first Test of the 2008–09 series at the Gabba. His 5 wickets for 39 runs in the second innings raised his tally to 9 wickets for the match. Australia won the match by 149 runs and his performance earned him the man-of-the-match award. His best bowling figures for an innings are 8 wickets for 61 runs against South Africa in 2008. In Test matches, Johnson was most successful against England, taking 5 of his 12 five-wicket hauls against them.\nIn 2005, Johnson made his ODI debut against New Zealand. He took his first five-wicket haul against India in 2007. Johnson took 5 wickets for 26 runs in the match, which Australian won by 9 wickets. His career best figures are 6 wickets for 31 runs against Sri Lanka at Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in 2011. Although Johnson made his first T20I appearance in 2007, he did not pick up a fifer in the format. Figures of 3 wickets for 15 runs against Sri Lanka in 2010 were his best in this version of the game."

The ground is Rwanda's first dedicated international cricket ground and has quickly became a prominent ground in African cricket. \nHistory.\nIn August 2011, the Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation was formed as a charity, run on a not for profit basis, with the aim of building and managing the first ever dedicated international cricket ground in Rwanda. The ground was completed in March 2017. It is located on a site on the edge of Kigali, Rwanda's capital. \nThe charity is run by a team of cricket enthusiasts from the UK and Rwanda in partnership with the Marylebone Cricket Club Foundation. \nIn 2012, West Indian cricketing great Brian Lara agreed to become one of the ground's patrons. The stadium is also supported by former British Prime Minister David Cameron, Andrew Mitchell, Jonathan Agnew, Heather Knight, Peter Gummer, Baron Chadlington\nIn 2016, Rwanda captain Eric Dusingizimana achieved a Guinness World Record for batting 51 continuous hours at Amaharo Stadium in Remera. This was done to raise funds for the construction of the ground.\nOnce opened, the ground quickly gained prominence in African cricket and hosted various ICC events. In 2018, the ground was selected to host the matches in the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Africa Qualifier Eastern Sub-Region group. Once all associate members were given T20I status in 2019, the ground hosted its first T20I on 18 August 2021. \nThe stadium also hosted the 2019 Kwibuka Women's T20 Tournament, a women's cricket tournament, in remembrance of the victims of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Their successful hosting of multi-national tournaments during peak COVID-19 pandemic following the safety protocols had led to being given more tournaments subsequently.\nIn November 2022, the ground surpassed the Harare Sports Club as the cricket oval to host the most T20I matches in Africa.\nNotable Events.\nThe following notable events were hosted here with ICC International Status:\nInternational record.\nTwenty20 International centuries.\nFive T20I centuries have been scored at the venue.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nSix 20I five-wicket haul has been taken at this venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International centuries.\nFour WT20I centuries have been scored at the venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nThree WT20I five-wicket haul has been taken at this venue."

        "title": "2014 Tour de France, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It featured 22 cycling teams. The Tour started in Yorkshire, England on 5 July and finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 27 July. The first two stages, in Yorkshire, were informally nicknamed \"Le Tour de Yorkshire\"; its success led to the formation of the Tour de Yorkshire stage race the following May.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage began on The Headrow, outside the Victorian Town Hall in Leeds. The tour headed eastwards through the city centre towards Quarry Hill, navigating the Sheepscar Interchange onto the A61 and heading northwards through the city districts of Scott Hall, Moortown and Alwoodley towards Harewood House where a ceremonial start took place. Following the departure from Harewood, the tour went along the Wharfe Valley passing through Otley, Burley in Wharfedale and the home of the Cow and Calf Rocks, Ilkley Moor. The race then headed north via the A65 to the market town of Skipton, before passing into the Yorkshire Dales National Park. After passing northwards through part of Wharfedale, into Wensleydale and through Hawes, the route continued over the Buttertubs Pass and down through Swaledale to Reeth. The race then headed south-east to cross the last categorised climb of the day at Grinton Moor before passing through Leyburn, the brewery town of Masham and the cathedral city of Ripon. Finally, travelling southwards, on the A61, through Killinghall and finishing at West Park in Harrogate.\nA break saw Jens Voigt secure the King of the Mountains jersey for the day, before returning to the peloton. The finale of the stage saw Mark Cavendish crash during the sprint, following a collision with Simon Gerrans. Cavendish suffered a separated right shoulder injury. The sprint was won by Marcel Kittel, thus repeating his opening stage victory from the previous year.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage of the tour started at the racecourse in York heading to the city centre where it then travelled into West Yorkshire through the towns of Knaresborough, Harrogate, Silsden, Addingham, Keighley, Haworth, Hebden Bridge, Mytholmroyd, Elland, Huddersfield, Honley and Holmfirth. The tour then climbed over the Category 2 \"Côte de Holme Moss\" at , and descended into the valley of the Woodhead pass. Passing into Derbyshire on the northern tip of the Peak District under the shadow of the Bleaklow plateau it then climbed over the Langsett Moors. Traversing across the moor the route crossed the Ewden valley and headed towards the village of Bradfield. From here the route descended towards the city of Sheffield where stage two finished.\nDuring the stage, Sacha Modolo withdrew from the tour due to illness. Cyril Lemoine took the lead for the King of the Mountains jersey, from Jens Voigt, having scored the most points during the day. Blel Kadri and Thomas Voeckler were the first two riders over the Category 2 climb of Holme Moss, both riders later returning to the peloton. Towards the finish, Alberto Contador and Chris Froome each took the opportunity to test the opposition, reducing the peloton to a leading group of 21 riders up the short, but steep, Category 4 climb of Jenkin Road Hill. Vincenzo Nibali took the lead with remaining, and held this short lead to the finish line.\nStage 3.\nThis short 155 km stage began at Parker's Piece in the university city of Cambridge and started by heading in a generally southern direction towards Saffron Walden. From Saffron Walden the route travelled east, and then south, to the western outskirts of Braintree, Essex, before following the road west to Felsted. The route turned south to Chelmsford, and then west to an intermediate sprint at Epping Forest. From here, the race continued south into the British capital, which hosted the Grand Départ during the 2007 Tour de France. This was a prestigious stage which took the peloton through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and travelled past some of London's most famous landmarks, before finishing near to Buckingham Palace, with the finish line on The Mall.\nJean-Marc Bideau and Jan Bárta spent out in front of the peloton, which was the greater part of the stage. Both riders each taking part in their first Tour de France, Bideau was the first to succumb to the gradual acceleration of the peloton, with remaining, on the outskirts of central London. Meanwhile, Bárta managed to stay in front for a further . The peloton was then together for a bunch sprint on The Mall. Marcel Kittel succeeded in securing his sixth stage win at the Tour de France, and his second stage win of the 2014 Tour.\nStage 4.\nThe first stage in France departed from the seaside resort of Le Touquet, with racing officially starting just east of Cucq. The first climb of the day was the Category 4 climb of the \"Côte de Campagnette\", into the stage, just north of Bimont. At , this was the highest point of a relatively fast and flat stage, which travelled through the undulating lowlands of Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The route passed through Saint-Omer, with an intermediate sprint at Cassel. The race then travelled through Steenvoorde, over the Category 4 climb of Mont Noir, and followed the road south-east from Bailleul and Armentières to Lille. The stage finished just east of the centre of Lille, at Villeneuve-d'Ascq.\nAndy Schleck retired from the tour, before the departure from Le Touquet. A few kilometres into the stage, Chris Froome fell in an accident which also involved Bauke Mollema and Ion Izagirre. Froome was able to rejoin the peloton. By the time the race had reached the top of Mont Noir, Thomas Voeckler was in front of the peloton along with Luis Ángel Maté. Greg Henderson was forced to retire, following a crash towards the end of the race, whilst Voeckler was caught by the peloton with remaining, with Maté also returning to the bunch around this time. The peloton was ready, once again, for a sprint finish. Marcel Kittel won his third stage out of four, but admitted that the stage had been fast and very nervous.\nStage 5.\nThis flat stage departed from Ypres in Belgium. Eddy Merckx and King Philippe were both present to see the riders depart. Racing officially started between Ypres and Zonnebeke. The race then headed north-east towards Roeselare, before turning due south to Menen and then on to Wevelgem. The stage continued south, re-entering France just before arriving in Roubaix. From here, onwards, the stage featured nine sections of difficult cobble-set pavement, using some of the same roads as the Paris–Roubaix cycle race. The intermediate sprint took place a further along the route south from Roubaix at Templeuve-en-Pévèle. The race then took a circuitous route west to Pont-à-Marcq, south to Bersée, and then east to Orchies. The culmination of the stage had the riders pass through several small villages in quick succession; Beuvry-la-Forêt, Tilloy-lez-Marchiennes, Warlaing, Wandignies-Hamage, Hornaing and Hélesmes. Finally, the stage finished just east of Wallers at the southern end of the Arenberg Trench, adjacent to the Arenberg Mine.\nInclement weather prompted tour organizers to remove two cobble segments from the stage route for safety reasons, leaving seven cobble segments for the riders to navigate.\nWet roads contributed to a multitude of crashes before the riders encountered the cobbles. Reigning champion Chris Froome was involved in two crashes at the point and the point. These crashes, combined with a crash the previous day and the lingering effects of a serious crash in the Critérium du Dauphiné several weeks prior, forced his abandonment from the race.\nUpon encountering the cobbles, the peloton splintered, with yellow jersey-wearer Vincenzo Nibali's team leading the pack. Nibali's group opened up a lead of nearly two minutes prior to encountering the seventh and last cobble segment, upon which Astana's Lieuwe Westra accelerated, leaving behind all but Nibali, teammate Jakob Fuglsang, and 's Lars Boom. Boom attacked the Astana riders on the last cobble segment and held his lead through the final kilometers to take his first victory of the 2014 season, as well as his first career stage win in the Tour de France. This came nine years to the day after the previous Dutch stage victory in the Tour. Nibali finished 19 seconds behind Boom, in so doing putting two minutes into GC contenders Andrew Talansky, Tejay van Garderen, and Alejandro Valverde, and nearly two-and-a-half minutes into Tour favorite Alberto Contador.\nStage 6.\nThis relatively fast and flat stage travelled from the department of Pas de Calais, through the departments of Somme, Aisne, and Marne. The stage started by heading south through Bapaume, Péronne, Ham, Tergnier and Chauny. The route then began to head east, over the Category 4 climb of \"Côte de Coucy-le-Château-Auffrique\", with an intermediate sprint later at Pinon. This was followed by the Category 4 climb of the \"Côte de Roucy\", and the road east to Bourgogne. Finally, the race headed south into Reims.\nArnaud Gérard, Tom Leezer, Luis Maté and Jérôme Pineau took part in an early escape, ahead of the peloton. Crashes occurred during a day of sidewinds, along with a second day of rain, forcing the retirement of Xabier Zandio and Jesús Hernández, amongst others. The early escapees were each brought back to the peloton from remaining, with Maté managing to stay in front for a further . Marcel Kittel had a mechanical problem in the final , and Michał Kwiatkowski attacked with remaining. However, the sprint was won by André Greipel who, along with other sprinters, caught Kwiatkowski before the finish.\nStage 7.\nThis long and undulating stage travelled through the departments of Marne, Meuse and Meurthe-et-Moselle. The stage departed from Épernay, with the race officially starting at Oiry. The route first headed east through Châlons-en-Champagne, Sainte-Menehould and Clermont-en-Argonne and continued on this course to Charny-sur-Meuse. The route then turned south-east just before travelling through Douaumont and then continued in this direction through Moulainville and Fresnes-en-Woëvre. An intermediate sprint took place at Hannonville-sous-les-Côtes and the south-easterly route continued through Bernécourt. The route turned east from Dommartin-lès-Toul and two Category 4 climbs came towards the end of the stage, these were the \"Côte de Maron\" and the \"Côte de Boufflers\". The stage then finished in Nancy.\nStage 8.\nThe stage travelled through the departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Vosges. The stage had most of the route as undulating, with a mild climb. Towards the end, the stage entered low mountains.\nThis stage headed east out of the Tomblaine district of Nancy, and through Lunéville, before the route turned south towards Baccarat. The route continued south-west through Rambervillers to Épinal, followed by an intermediate sprint at Dinozé as the route turned east, once again, and followed the Moselle to Remiremont, Saint-Amé and Vagney. From Vagney, the race then went into the Vosges mountains with two Category 2 climbs, these being the , through La Bresse and over the . The race then headed north into Gérardmer and up to the ski station of .\nFive riders were in the breakaway for the day. Sylvain Chavanel was the best climber in the breakaway. However, on the final climb Blel Kadri launched an attack which nobody was able to follow. Behind in the peloton started chasing so that Alberto Contador could possibly win the stage. With 2 kilometres to go Blel Kadri had a 4-minute advantage over the peloton which would be enough for him to become the first French rider to win a stage of that Tour de France. As the peloton reached the final kilometre Contador made a number of attacks to try to gain time on Vincenzo Nibali and Richie Porte. He could only gain 3 seconds on Nibali and 7 on Porte. Critérium du Dauphiné winner Andrew Talansky of crashed and finished 35th. He was over 4 and half minutes down in the overall standings in 16th place. Blel Kadri won the stage by over 2 minutes and also took charge of the King of the Mountains classification.\nStage 9.\nThis low mountain stage travelled from the department of Vosges, into Haut-Rhin. The stage departed from Gérardmer with racing officially starting between Gérardmer and Xonrupt-Longemer. The race headed east to the Category 2 Col de la Schlucht at , and descended north-east into the valley floor, then south-east, towards the outskirts of Orbey. The route then began to climb the Category 3 Col du Wettstein at before a long descent east to the outskirts of Turckheim. From here, the route headed south and, once again, the road quickly rose to the Category 3 Côte des Cinq Châteaux at , and was quickly followed by the Category 2 Côte de Gueberschwihr at before heading south-west. An intermediate sprint took place at Linthal, before heading west for the biggest climb of the day. The Category 1 Le Markstein at gave a ascent to the ski station, with the ascent continuing south-east into the Category 3 Le Grand Ballon at . The route then took a fast descent continuing south-east into Cernay and Wittelsheim, through Pfastatt and finally finishing in Mulhouse.\nStage 10.\nThis mountainous stage set off from the department of Haut-Rhin, headed back into Vosges and finished in the department of Haute-Saône. The stage started at Mulhouse, with racing officially starting just north of Wittenheim. The route turned north-west at Ensisheim and zig-zagged from Raedersheim, through Gundolsheim to Soultzmatt. The race then began the ascent of the Category 2 at before descending to a sprint at Muhlele (Gunsbach). The race began to head west just before the sprint. This was rapidly followed by the race travelling through Munster. The route then turned to the south-west and traversed two Category 1 climbs.

        "title": "Climbing Trees",
        "text": "Climbing Trees are a Welsh four-piece \"Cymrucana\" band based in Pontypridd, South Wales. The group currently features Matthew Frederick (piano/guitar/vocals), Colenso Jones (guitar/bass/vocals), Martin Webb (guitar/bass/vocals) and James Bennetts (drums/vocals).\nHistory.\nFormed in 2011, the band soon came to the attention of BBC Radio Wales as work on their first release progressed, being named BBC Introducing Band of the Week in February 2013 after supporting New York group Spin Doctors the previous month. Shortly after, the band appeared as part of \"BBC Radio Wales Music Day\", before \"Single of the Week\" (for \"Aloisi\") and \"Welsh Artist of the Week\" recognition followed in August 2013. In October of the same year, the band were hand-picked by Jamie Cullum as the support act for the Cardiff leg of his \"Momentum\" tour.\nThe band recorded their debut album \"Hebron\" at Mwnci Studios in Carmarthenshire between May 2012 and February 2013, releasing it in August. The album was described as \"an essential purchase for 2013\" by the BBC's Bethan Elfyn; New Sound Wales deemed the record \"one of the most impressive albums of 2013\"; and Wales Online described the album as \"majestic\", listing \"pure blown gospel standout\" track \"Burning Candle\" amongst \"The 51 greatest Welsh pop records of 2013\".\nIn April 2014, Climbing Trees were announced as one of the twelve BBC Horizons Gorwelion acts for 2014–2015. They've toured performed around the UK and performed at various festivals, including Green Man, Laugharne and Festival N°6.\nThe band's second album, \"Borders\", was released in July 2016 on Matthew Frederick's label Staylittle Music. It was again recorded at Mwnci Studios. Preceding it were the singles \"Graves\" and \"Tracks\". The album was nominated for the 2015-2016 Welsh Music Prize.\nCymrucana.\nThe band's sound has often been described as \"Cymrucana\". 'A nod to both the Cool Cymru explosion of the 1990s and the ever-popular folk-rock genre Americana', the term was apparently invented and perpetuated by the band themselves. In a March 2014 interview with New Sound Wales, Frederick described:\nOn the band's sound, BBC Radio Wales presenter Adam Walton said: \"They've managed to transplant the musical heart of America – The Band, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Grizzly Bear – to their spiritual home ... without missing a beat\", while a 2014 review noted that \"you could be forgiven for thinking this was a band from Los Angeles rather than Pontypridd\"."

        "title": "Tri-State League (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Tri-State League was a NCAA Division I ice hockey-only conference. The league was the first attempt at creating a conference for hockey programs and, while it did not succeed in its goals, succeeding conferences were able to learn from the mistakes made and flaws in its design to form effective and long-lasting divisions.\nHistory.\nFormed in 1950 by the six colleges, all located in the Northeast, the Tri-State League was named for the three states represented by the schools: Massachusetts with Williams, New York with Clarkson, Colgate, Rensselaer and St. Lawrence and Vermont with Middlebury. In the first season each school played one another once, resulting in five conference games for every team. After the 1950–51 season, however, Colgate left the conference, leaving the league with only five member teams. The following year seven western teams formed the MCHL and while it wasn't a direct rival to the Tri-State League it had several advantages over its eastern counterpart. For one the MCHL contained the majority of the regional schools playing D-I ice hockey so its league champion would almost assuredly be invited to the NCAA tournament whereas the Eastern region had more than 30 schools playing at the top level, giving the Tri-State League a much smaller footprint. Its influence grew even smaller after the second season when Williams left the conference, not only reducing its numbers to four, but no longer making the conference's title geographically correct.\nIt wasn't all bad news for the Tri-State League, however, as St. Lawrence was invited to play in the 1952 tournament. In fact, the Tri-State League would send a representative to the tournament each year from 1952 through 1964. With the success of the three remaining New York schools, Middlebury was left far behind in the standings, winning only two games over a seven-year stretch before leaving the conference after 1958–59. With only three teams as members the Tri-State League was a conference in name only and became completely superfluous in 1961 when the 28-team mega conference, ECAC Hockey, was formed including all three teams still in the Tri-State League.\nThe Tri-State League continued to award a trophy at the conclusion of the regular season for several years, even after changing its name to the ICAC (Independent College Athletic Conference), but even that was abandoned after 1971–72. Since joining ECAC Hockey in 1961, Clarkson, Rensselaer and St. Lawrence have remained in the conference and were reunited with Colgate the same year. While both Middlebury and Williams were inaugural members of the ECAC, both were dropped down to Division III after the conference split in 1964 and became founding members of the NESCAC in 1971 where they still reside (as of 2014).\nFirsts.\nAside from being the first official conference in the college hockey ranks, the Tri-State League also produced the first postseason conference game ever played when Clarkson and Middlebury tied at the end of the first season and were matched in a tie-breaker to determine the league champion. There wouldn't be another conference playoff game until the 1960 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. When Rensselaer won the national title in 1954 it became only the second eastern school to do so, and the first to win as part of a conference (Boston College had won in 1949 as an independent)."

        "text": " \nSean Edward Coyle (born January 17, 1992) is an American former professional baseball second baseman. Listed at 5' 8\" , 175 lb. , Coyle batted and threw right handed. He was born in Chalfont, Pennsylvania.\nHigh school.\nCoyle hit .562 with 55 runs batted in and a school-record 13 home runs as a senior at Germantown Academy, to claim 2009–2010 Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year honors and a selection to the 2010 Baseball America All-America High School First Team. Previously, he had batted .296 in eight games for USA Baseball's 18-and-under team at the 2009 Pan American Junior Championships (COPABE) held in Barquisimeto, Venezuela.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe Red Sox selected Coyle in the third round of the 2010 MLB draft out of Germantown Academy in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, signing him for a bonus of $1,300,000. He then played from 2010 through 2013 for the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, Greenville Drive and Salem Red Sox, before joining the Portland Sea Dogs in 2014. He was added to the 40-man roster in November 2014.\nCoyle was named the Red Sox's No. 17 prospect by MLB.com entering the 2012 season, after leading Class-A Greenville and sharing the lead among Red Sox minor leaguers with seven triples in 2011. He also topped Greenville in walks (60), while ranking second both in doubles (27) and runs (77) as well as third in RBI (64) and stolen bases (14). In addition, Coyle collected a career-high seven RBI in Greenville's season finale against the Hickory Crawdads on September 5, 2011 and was named a MiLB Organizational All-Star in that season, repeating that honor in 2012.\nIn 2013, Coyle was a member of the Salem champion team and was named the Carolina League Championship Series MVP after hitting two two-run doubles for a total of seven RBI in the three-game series. Unfortunately, he did not play in the Division Series due to an injury.\nCoyle was added to the US roster for the 2014 All-Star Futures Game in late June, 2014. He was named as a replacement for Mookie Betts, who was no longer eligible after his promotion to the Boston Red Sox. The announcement highlighted a resurgence for Coyle, who appeared in only 60 games in an injury-plagued 2013 season. Along with missing time with injuries to his thumb, knee, and elbow, he hit only .241 while repeating the Carolina League.\nAfter a solid start in 2014 with Double-A Portland, Coyle then missed four weeks with a hamstring injury. Nevertheless, he was dominant after his activation in May, and excelled in June. In one particularly impressive stretch, he went 8-for-15 (.533) with five walks, four extra-base hits, and 11 RBI in a four-game series against the Reading Fightin Phils, winning a Player of the Week distinction (June 23–29). The month was capped when he posted a slash line of .348/.450/.652 with an organization-leading six home runs to earn Player of the Month honors, as well as his Futures Games and Eastern League All-Star Game selections on the same day. He hit .295/.371/.512 in 384 plate appearances in 2014, driving in 61 runs and scoring 60 times, while mashing 16 homers and stealing 13 bases. After that, he joined the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League in the month of November. Coyle credited much of his success to the influence of former Red Sox catcher Rich Gedman, who served as his hitting instructor at Salem and coached him at Portland.\nIn 2015 Coyle gained a promotion to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He was rated as the Red Sox's No. 17 prospect in 2015, according to MLB.com.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nIn mid-July 2016, Coyle was designated for assignment by the Red Sox. On July 18, he was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn December 13, 2016, Coyle signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles organization. He was released on June 5, 2017."

        "text": "Commercial Rowing Club is a sports club located in Dublin, affiliated with Rowing Ireland. Commercial Rowing Club facilitates competitive rowing for Juniors (under 18 years of age)and Adults (including Novices, Intermediates, Seniors and Veterans). The Club is open to male and female athletes. The club colours are Myrtle Green, White &amp; Azure Blue.\nThe Commercial Rowing Club Boathouse is located at Islandbridge, where the calm protected waters of the upper Liffey enable rowing year-round. Commercial also has access to the shared boathouse on Blessington Lake in Wicklow.\nHistory.\nCommercial Rowing Club was founded in Ringsend in 1856. It is the second oldest rowing club in Ireland. The name dates an era when all non-university clubs were designated ‘commercial’. The original membership was drawn from the Commercial heart of Dublin, tailors, bankers and other shopkeepers of Henry Street and Grafton Street and the boat house was originally located in Ringsend.\nTo avoid the inconvenience and dangers of the Tides and the port traffic, Commercial moved upstream from Ringsend to the peaceful waters of Islandbridge in 1942 to take over the premises of Dublin Rowing Club, which had become insolvent.\nIn the sixties recruitment was predominantly among young working men who rowed mainly in Novice grades. With the boathouse locked up for the 1969 season the club decided to go in an entirely different direction and bring in juniors in Big Numbers in the seventies. Oarswomen had to be secretly introduced and trained to a standard where they would win at their first regatta. The site of a Commercial “ladies” crew in front on the winning straight was too much for even the most hardened misogynist and the girls were finally accepted in the club.

By the year 2000, Commercial Rowing Club had won nearly 100 Irish National Championship medals. This placed the club in second place in Ireland.\nAt the 1991 World Rowing Championships in Vienna, a sculler from Commercial RC named Niall O'Toole won a Gold Medal in the Men's Lightweight Single Scull, breaking the world record in a time of 6m:49.49s in the process. This was Ireland's first Gold medal in any Rowing World Championship event. O'Toole went on to compete in three Olympic Games. In 1991 and 1994, O'Toole was presented with the Texaco All Star award. The 1990s brought in a total of five World Championship medals and several u/23 medals.\nRegattas.\nCommercial Rowing Club has been strongly represented on the organizing committee for the Dublin Metropolitan Regatta (aka \"Metro\") since 1869.\nOutside of Metro, Commercial also regularly hosts its own regatta and, by 2008, Commercial had hosted its 26th regatta. Initially the regatta was for women's events only, but men's events were added in 1986."

        "text": "Group A of the 1978 FIFA World Cup was one of two groups of nations competing for the De facto semifinals the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The group's first round of matches began on 14 June and its last matches were played on 21 June. All six group matches were played either at the Estadio Chateau Carreras in Córdoba, or the Estadio Monumental in the capital Buenos Aires. The group consisted of West Germany (the Defending Champions) as well as the Netherlands (the former runners up), Italy and Austria. The Netherlands advanced to the final match, and Italy advanced to the third place match.\nQualified teams.\nThe winners of Group 1 and 3 and the runners-up of Group 2 and 4 qualified for Group A of the second round.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nAustria vs Netherlands.\nAfter an unconvincing group stage performance the Netherlands knew they had to play better if they were to qualify for the finals, and took on surprise qualifiers Austria in their first game. They started well when an unmarked Ernie Brandts headed in Arie Haan's free kick. The Dutch then won a penalty kick after Gerhard Breitenberger fouled Wim Jansen and Rob Rensenbrink neatly scored. Rensenbrink then took advantage of some poor defending to provide assist for Johnny Rep to score on either side of half time. Austria which created several chances and were unlucky to score in the first half got one back in the eightieth minute when defender Erich Obermayer scored a brilliant lob over the Dutch goalkeeper for a goal. The Dutch weren't to be deterred as Rensenbrink provided yet another assist this time Willy van de Kerkhof to score just two minutes later.\nNetherlands vs West Germany.\nThis highly anticipated match was a repeat of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final, with the Netherlands fielding six players who had played that day and West Germany four. The match official Ramón Barreto of Uruguay coincidentally had also been one of the linesmen at the 1974 final.\nThe 1974 final had started with the Dutch scoring within two minutes, and in this match there was another early goal, although it went the Germans' way. The Dutch goaltender Piet Schrijvers could only parry Rainer Bonhof's free kick right into the path of Rüdiger Abramczik, who headed home. The Netherlands equalized around the thirty-minute mark when Arie Haan let fly from 35 yards and into the top corner.\nKnowing a draw would be enough Netherlands refrained from taking chances in the second half. Against the run of play West Germany were awarded a soft free-kick, the Dutch were complaining with the referee and did not keep their concentration Erich Beer crossed for Dieter Müller to power in a header. The goal gave the Netherlands the momentum to score though and eight minutes from time René van de Kerkhof took a pass from his twin brother Willy, cut inside a defender and smashed home. There would be a few more chances as Johnny Rep hit the woodwork and Schrijvers was forced to save from Beer.\nThe match ended in bizarre fashion, with substitute Dick Nanninga shown a yellow card for an off the ball incident and then seconds later referee Barreto showing the same player a red card for apparently laughing at the decision to give him a card. It took five minutes to restore order on the field as the bewildered Nanninga was led off.\nItaly vs Netherlands.\nThis match was a semifinal in all but name with the winner being assured a place in the final, although the Netherlands could advance with a draw and a Germany draw or loss. Italy started the positive and scored when Ernie Brandts in an attempt to stop Roberto Bettega only succeeded in putting the ball into his own net. The goal would have consequences for the Netherlands as Piet Schrijvers was injured on the play and had to be stretchered off for Jan Jongbloed. Italy dominated the remainder of the first half. In a physical match Johnny Rep was cautioned for fouling Romeo Benetti, who was later to pick up a yellow card himself for fouling Rensenbrink, meaning the Italian defender would miss the final should Italy reach it. Early in the second half Arie Haan was cautioned for a challenge on Marco Tardelli who later also picked up a yellow card meaning he too would miss Italy's next match. Some felt that Antonio Cabrini's challenge on Haan many felt warranted a red card, not just a yellow. Shortly after half time Brandts, who had earlier scored an own goal, blasted home a shot to equalize. Then fourteen minutes from time Haan hit an audacious shot 30 yards out that went off Zoff's left post and into the net."

        "title": "List of Six Nations Championship hat-tricks",
        "text": "A hat-trick in rugby union, the scoring of three tries or three drop goals in a single match, has been achieved 55 times in the history of the Six Nations Championship. The annual competition, established in 1882, was originally known as the Home Nations Championship and contested between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. It was expanded to the Five Nations when France joined in 1910, and then to the Six Nations with the addition of Italy in 2000.\nThe first player to achieve the feat was Charles Wade, who was an Australian student at Oxford University when he was called up as a travelling reserve for England's match against Wales. When Philip Newton got lost on his way to the match, Wade was instated in his place. He scored three tries in England's 2–0 victory, which was the first match of the championship. At that time, a try by itself was not worth any points but allowed the team to \"try\" and kick a goal. George Lindsay scored five tries in Scotland's 4–0 win over Wales in 1887, the most tries scored by a single player in a Championship match.\nBesides Lindsay, six players have scored more than three tries in a Championship match; of these Ian Smith is the only player to achieve the feat twice. He scored four tries in successive matches during the 1925 Five Nations Championship. Wales' Jehoida Hodges normally played as a forward, but after an injury to winger Tom Pearson during a match against England, Hodges was moved to the wing. Despite playing out of position, he scored a hat-trick in a 21–5 victory for Wales. As of 2017, the only forwards to score a Championship hat-trick while actually playing in the forwards are Michel Crauste; he scored three tries for France in their 13–0 victory over England in 1962 and CJ Stander; he scored three tries for Ireland in a 63–10 win over Italy in 2017.\nFour players have scored a hat-trick of drop goals: Pierre Albaladejo, Jean-Patrick Lescarboura, Diego Dominguez and Neil Jenkins. No Italian has scored a hat-trick of tries in the competition, with Dominguez's hat-trick of drop goals the only one by an Italian player. English players have scored the most hat-tricks with 18, while France, Ireland and Scotland have conceded the most, with 12 each. Three players have scored a hat-trick and been on the losing side; Robert Montgomery in Ireland's 0–1 loss to Wales in 1887, Howard Marshall in England's 11–12 defeat to Wales in 1893, and Émile Ntamack in France's 33–34 loss to Wales in 1999. Lescarboura's hat-trick against England in 1985 and Jenkins' against Scotland in 2001, are the only times the feat has been achieved with the match ending in a draw. The most recent hat-trick was achieved by Blair Kinghorn (Scotland) against Italy on 18 March 2023.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) presents twelve annual awards to recognize its teams, players, and coaches for their accomplishments. An additional seven awards officially recognized by the PBA were also given annually by the PBA Press Corps during a season break. This does not include the championship trophies for the Philippine, Commissioner's and Governors' Cups which are given to the winning team of its respective finals.\nThe league awarded trophies with varying designs for their tournament/conference champions from 1975 to 1993 until the trophy designs were standardized in 1994 for the All-Filipino, Commissioner's and Governors' Cups.\nThe Commissioner's and Governors' Cups were deactivated in 2003, when the name of the second and third conferences were changed to Invitational and Reinforced Conferences. Further changes in the tournament calendar were made in 2004 when the league decided to hold only two tournaments per season; the All-Filipino Cup, renamed as the Philippine Cup and the import-laced Fiesta Conference.\nThe Philippine Cup trophy design also varied from 2003 to 2006. In 2007, a new trophy, named the \"Perpetual Trophy\", later named as the Jun Bernardino Trophy was made for the winners of the said tournament. In 2010, the league re-adopted the three-conference season format and reactivated the Commissioner's and Governors' Cups as the second and third conference of the PBA season.\nAside from these annual awards, the league also has weekly honors during the conference for its players.\nEach individual award, with the exception of the Best Player of the Conference, Best Import and Finals MVP (which are given near the conclusion of the conference), is awarded during the PBA Leo Awards, which is held before the start of the fourth game (or third game if it is a best-of-five) of the third conference's finals series.\nTeam trophies.\nNote: The league awarded different trophy designs for the All-Filipino Conference/Philippine Cup from 1975 to 1994 and from 2003 to 2007. The other import-laced, non-consecutive and special conferences from 1975 to 2010 such as the Open, Reinforced, Invitational, and Fiesta Conferences have different trophy designs per tournament. The Commissioner's and Governors' Cups were first awarded in 1993, albeit a different trophy design. "

It played one first-class match in the 1980–81 season.\nThe Jones Cup (later known as the Guystac Trophy amongst other names) has been contested by Berbice, Demerara and Essequibo since 1954–55. Each season the holder of the trophy would play the winner of a semi-final between the other two teams. If the final was drawn, the trophy stayed with the defending side. From 1971–72 to 1989–90 the final had first-class status. \nIn every season but one the final was between Berbice and Demerara. The exception was in 1980–81 when Essequibo won through to play Berbice in the final. The match was played in Essequibo, at Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground, Hampton Court, just north of the town of Anna Regina. Essequibo batted first and made 152 and 163; Berbice scored 276 and 43 for 1 to win by nine wickets. For all 11 Essequibo players it was their only first-class match.\nNotable players.\nThe following players either played in Essequibo's one and only first-class match, or played inter-county matches for Essequibo and first-class matches for another team or teams. Courtney Gonsalves was the only Essequibo player from their 1980–81 team to go on to play for Guyana, which he did in two matches of List A cricket."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team represented the University of Virginia during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, in their 110th season of play. The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett, in his sixth year, and played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nBuilding on the success of the previous season, the Cavaliers had their best regular season in program history with a record of 28–2, their first undefeated non-conference regular season record since 2000–01, and their highest national ranking since 1982–83, ranking at number two on the AP Poll for a total of seven weeks. The Cavaliers also became the first team outside of Tobacco Road to win back-to-back ACC regular season championships, with their conference record of 16–2. Particular highlights included holding Rutgers, Harvard, and Georgia Tech to under thirty points each. Virginia also held Harvard to a single field goal in the first half of their game, tying the NCAA record for fewest field goals allowed in the first half of a game since the shot clock was instituted in 1986. However, late-season injuries, in particular Justin Anderson's nearly five-week-long absence due to a broken finger and appendectomy, hurt the team, with the Cavaliers falling in a close loss to North Carolina in the ACC tournament semifinals. In the NCAA tournament they defeated Belmont in the second round before losing in the third round to Michigan State.\nLast season.\nThe Cavaliers finished the season 30–4 overall and 16–2 in conference play, finishing in first place in the ACC outright for the first time since the 1980–81 season. They proceeded to win the ACC tournament for their second-ever conference championship. The team also tied for the most wins in a season in school history, set a school record for the most single-season conference wins, and earned their highest final national ranking since 1982. The Cavaliers received a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they defeated Coastal Carolina and Memphis before losing to Michigan State in the Sweet Sixteen.\nRoster.\nOn November 7, 2014, head coach Tony Bennett announced, via a Virginia athletic department press release, that London Perrantes and Evan Nolte would be suspended for two scrimmages and the first game of the season due to a violation of team rules. Following the first game of the season against James Madison, Bennett stated that Jack Salt was \"leaning\" towards a redshirt, but he had not made a final decision yet.\nOn February 7, 2015, Justin Anderson suffered a broken finger in his left hand during the Louisville game. He had surgery the next day, and was expected to return to playing after four to six weeks, but an emergency appendectomy on March 5 kept him sidelined. Anderson returned to play seven days later, against Florida State in the ACC Tournament quarterfinals.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| ACC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament\nRankings.\nOn April 28, 2014, ESPN's preseason top-25 rankings listed Virginia at seventh in the nation. On August 11, Sporting News ranked Virginia eighth in their preseason poll.\nVirginia's #2 ranking on Week 10 (January 12, 2015) was the first time Virginia was ranked in the top two nationally since the week of March 8, 1983.\nAwards and honors.\nAwards by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association (ACSMA) were released on March 8. ACC coaches awards were released the following day,\n and then followed on March 10 with individual awards from the United States Basketball Writers Association. On March 16, USBWA released All-American selections, naming Brogdon to their second team. One week later, USBWA named Bennett the Henry Iba Award winner. On March 27, the National Association of Basketball Coaches released their District 2 awards. On March 30, the Associated Press and NABC named their All-American teams, including Brogdon on both organizations' second teams, and Anderson on the NABC third team."

        "text": "David Patrick Ward (born 21 May 1985) is an English rugby union player for Premiership side Harlequins, and Head Coach of Bristol Bears Women. A hooker, Ward has previously played for Ampthill RUFC, Sale Sharks, Northampton Saints, Bath Rugby and the Cornish Pirates. At international level he has represented the England under-18s, under-21s and Saxons.\nClub career.\nBorn in Bath, Ward joined his local club Bath Rugby as a six-year-old, progressing all the way through to the first team for whom he made his debut as a replacement in the Heineken Cup against Treviso in December 2004. His first start came a month later against Leinster Rugby and despite Bath losing, he was named as the Man of the Match. He made just six more appearances for the club over the next two years, and, after finding himself as fourth choice hooker, joined Northampton Saints on a two-year contract in 2007.\nHe made six appearances for Saints in their 2007–08 promotion winning season, scoring four tries, but was released from his contract by the club a year early in October 2008. Days later he joined Sale Sharks, though he again failed to secure regular playing time, making just three appearances during the 2008–09 season. During his time with Sale the club received a one-point deduction after he came off the bench against Harlequins prior to being re-registered following a loan spell at Manchester.\nHe time at Sale was hampered by injury and after only one season, Ward joined Championship club Cornish Pirates in Summer 2009. He turned down a part-time contract from Pertemps Bees alongside a sales job in favour of the Pirates and later revealed that he had contemplated retirement prior to the move. He made his competitive debut against Nottingham in September 2009 and went on to make 33 appearances in his first season. He was ever-present in the two following years, racking up 110 appearances in his three years at the club.\nIn April 2012 he returned to the Premiership after signing a contract with Harlequins for the 2012–13 season. His first season at The Stoop followed a similar pattern to his spells with Bath, Saints and Sale, with Ward making only seven appearances, five of which came in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. His Premiership breakthrough came in 2013–14 at the age of 28 where, following injuries to regular hookers Joe Gray and Rob Buchanan, he made 31 appearances, including his first Premiership start for seven years. Over the course of the campaign he earned five Man of the Match awards and was voted the Players' Player of the Season.\nInternational career.\nWard first represented England at under-18 and under-21 level. In January 2014 he was rewarded for his club form with a call up to the England Saxons squad for two games against Scotland the Ireland Wolfhounds. He started the first game which ended in a 16–16 draw and came off the bench as the second ended in a 14–8 defeat. Four months later he was included in England's senior squad for the three Test summer tour of New Zealand. Though he was not included in the matchday 23 for any of the Tests, he was a second-half replacement in the tour game against the Crusaders which England won 38–7.\nPersonal life.\nIn August 2020 Ward married Harlequins and England player Abbie Scott."

With the exception of Rookie of the Year, which was added in 1996, the awards date to the 1990 season, the conference's first season of baseball. Through the 1996 season, the awards were known as the major awards of the North Atlantic Conference, the America East's former name.\nThrough the end of the 2019 season, Stony Brook has won 21 major awards, the most of any school in the conference. Maine has the second highest total, with 20. Three other schools have at least ten: Binghamton (19), Delaware (17), and Vermont (10).\nIn the conference's 25–year history, a single team has swept the awards six times. Three instances came before 1996 (when the conference Rookie of the Year was added as the fourth award): Central Connecticut in 1990 and Delaware in 1992 and 1995. Since 1996, Stony Brook swept the awards in 2011 and 2012, and Hartford did so in 2018.\nCoach of the Year.\nThe conference's Coach of the Year award is presented annually to its most outstanding baseball coach, as chosen by a vote of the conference's coaches at the end of the regular season. The award was first presented in 1990 and was known as the North Atlantic Conference Coach of the Year award through the 1996 season, after which the conference adopted its current name.\nIn 2014, Stony Brook's Matt Senk won the award for the third time, after the Seawolves went 33–16 in the regular season and won the America East's regular season title.

        "text": "The Notre Dame–UConn women's basketball rivalry is a college rivalry series between the UConn Huskies women's basketball team of the University of Connecticut and the Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team of the University of Notre Dame. The Huskies and Fighting Irish have met 54 times, including eight times in the NCAA Tournament and twice in the NCAA Championship, with the Huskies holding a 39–15 advantage.\nConnecticut's 39 wins are the most for any opponent against Notre Dame. No other opponent has more than 30 wins against the Irish. Notre Dame's 15 wins are the most for any opponent against Connecticut. No other opponent has double-digit wins against the Huskies. \nBackground.\nThe Connecticut Huskies and Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball teams are two of the more successful teams in women's collegiate basketball. The UConn Huskies have won eleven national championships, while the Notre Dame Fighting Irish have nine Final Four appearances, with two National Championships in 2001 and 2018. Both teams formerly played in the Big East Conference, and appeared in the title game of the Big East tournament multiple times, with UConn appearing 23 times between 1989 and 2013, and Notre Dame appearing seven times in the same time period.\nFrom April 2011 to March 2013, Notre Dame won seven out of its eight match-ups with UConn, the best performance of any team against UConn since Tennessee. However, Notre Dame fell to UConn in the 2013 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament despite Notre Dame beating them three times during the regular season that year.\nIn 2014, UConn and Notre Dame both went into the national championship undefeated. This is the first time two undefeated teams went to the title game in men's and women's NCAA Division I basketball history. This was also their first meeting in a championship game. UConn won that game handily. The next year, both teams made it to the title game again, where UConn won its tenth national championship and third national championship in a row. \"New York Times\" reporter Harvey Araton observed that in this \"latest showdown between the premier women’s programs\" there was an \"absence of the mutual hostility\" that had characterized the previous year's matchup.\nAfter seven consecutive wins by UConn over Notre Dame, the Irish beat the Huskies in the semifinals of the 2018 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. Despite losing in a regular season matchup the following year, Notre Dame defeated UConn again in the 2019 Final Four matchup 81-76. From the start of the 2011–2012 season to the end of the 2018–2019 season, UConn had only 15 losses, with eight of them coming against Notre Dame."

        "title": "University of Minnesota basketball scandal",
        "text": "The University of Minnesota basketball scandal involved National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations, most notably academic dishonesty, committed by the University of Minnesota men's basketball program. The story broke the day before the 1999 NCAA Tournament, when the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" reported that Minnesota academic counseling office manager Jan Gangelhoff had done coursework for at least 20 Minnesota basketball players since 1993.\nIn the resulting scandal, four players from the Minnesota basketball team were immediately suspended, pending an investigation for academic fraud. Head coach Clem Haskins, men's athletic director Mark Dienhart, and university vice president McKinley Boston all resigned. Minnesota voluntarily sat out the 1999–2000 postseason, among other self-imposed sanctions. In 2000, the NCAA placed the Minnesota men's basketball program on four years' probation and reduced scholarships, based on numerous findings of academic fraud, improper benefits, and other ethics violations.\n\"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" reporting.\nOn March 10, 1999, the day before Minnesota was to play in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" reported, in an article by George Dohrmann, that Jan Gangelhoff, an office manager of the university academic counseling unit, alleged that she had completed hundreds of pieces of coursework for more than 20 Minnesota men's basketball players. According to Dohrmann, former players including Courtney James and Bobby Jackson corroborated Gangelhoff's claims. Gangelhoff provided him with printed samples of coursework written by her and turned in by students. Among other allegations by Gangelhoff: she was allowed to continue assisting players despite being caught in 1996 doing a take-home exam with a player, an assistant coach drove players to Gangelhoff's home for tutoring sessions in possible violation of NCAA rules, Gangelhoff duplicated the same work for different student-athletes to turn in to different classes, and coach Clem Haskins paid Gangelhoff in cash to tutor players.\nImmediately after the \"Pioneer Press\" reported this story, the University of Minnesota began an investigation, suspending four players for the NCAA Tournament: starters Kevin Clark and Miles Tarver, and reserves Antoine Broxsie and Jason Stanford, alleged as among those for whom Gangelhoff had done work. Minnesota lost to Gonzaga in the first round of the tournament on March 11. Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura accused the \"Pioneer Press\" of timing the article to be published around NCAA Tournament time for the sake of \"sensationalism journalism.\" The newspaper received many hostile calls and letters in response to this report.\nAfter the March 10 article, two more people came forward claiming to have done coursework for Minnesota basketball players: Gangelhoff's sister Jeanne Payer and Alexandra Goulding, a Minnesota sociology doctoral candidate. In a \"Pioneer Press\" article published on March 24, 1999, Goulding said that she wrote a paper for Minnesota starting forward Courtney James in 1995. After telling coach Haskins that she would never do student-athletes' assignments again, Goulding said Haskins responded: \"[James] needed a lot of help.\"\nNCAA investigation and findings.\nOn October 24, 2000, the NCAA published its public infractions report relating to University of Minnesota men's basketball. Among its findings of rules violations:\nAdditionally, the NCAA discovered that Haskins and other staffers had provided improper benefits to recruits and student-athletes, including cash payments made to student-athletes. Rules violations extended to football and men's ice hockey student-athletes, as well.\nSanctions.\nSelf-imposed.\nFollowing an internal investigation launched on March 19, 1999, the university self-imposed the following sanctions on its men's basketball program, among others:\nOn June 25, 1999, the university paid $1.5 million to buy out the contract of Clem Haskins. It hired Gonzaga head coach Dan Monson a month later to replace Haskins. This was four months after Gonzaga beat Minnesota in the NCAA Tournament. On November 19, 1999, the same day that Minnesota released its report of its internal investigation of the scandal, Minnesota president Mark Yudof accepted the resignations of vice president McKinley Boston and men's athletic director Mark Dienhart.\nThree years later, on May 13, 2002, Hennepin County District Judge Deborah Hedlund ordered Haskins to return $815,000 of the $1.5 million in buyout money paid to him. This was based on an arbitrator's recommendation, after the university argued that Haskins had committed fraud by lying to the NCAA yet accepting the buyout money.\nNCAA.\nFollowing its investigation, the NCAA issued the following sanctions to the university:\nShortly afterward, the Big Ten stripped the Gophers of the 1997 regular season title and vacated all of the Gophers' victories from 1993 to 1999.\nExtension of probation.\nIn July 2002, the NCAA found Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball liable for multiple rule violations regarding practice time and benefits that occurred under the watch of then-head coach Cheryl Littlejohn from 1998 to 2001. Because the NCAA treated the women's basketball violations as a separate matter from the men's basketball academic violations, Minnesota avoided being designated a repeat violator and getting the \"death penalty\" for the women's basketball program. Instead, the NCAA extended the existing probationary period until 2006.\nAftermath.\nBroxsie transferred to Oklahoma State after the spring 1999 semester.\nIn 2000, Dohrmann won the Pulitzer Prize for beat reporting for his reports on the scandal. According to Geneva Overholser of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, \"the closeness of the sports writing community, Dohrmann and his editor knew, meant that others would be quite ready to turn on them if their work fingered some of the Twin Cities' most beloved figures.\"\nMinnesota finished its first season under NCAA probation 18–14, including an appearance in the 2001 NIT. In November 2001, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that new coach Monson \"rebuilt\" the Minnesota men's basketball program after the scandal \"faster than seemed possible.\" Minnesota made the NIT again in 2002 and 2003 and next made the NCAA Tournament in 2005.\nHaskins worked as a scout for the Minnesota Timberwolves for a year after leaving the University of Minnesota. He then retired to his farm in Campbellsville, Kentucky. Dienhart became an executive at US Bank after resigning as men's athletic director. He returned to higher education in 2001 as senior vice president for institutional advancement at his alma mater, the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He was later appointed as executive vice president and chief operating officer, serving until 2013 when he went to a foundation. From 2004 to 2014, Boston was athletic director at New Mexico State University."

His total of 200 broke by one stroke the record previously held by Raymond Floyd in 1976 and Tiger Woods in 1997. Spieth got as low as 18-under during the round, tying Woods for lowest score in relation to par in tournament history, before a double bogey at the 17th.

Beginning the round four and five shots behind, respectively, Rose and Mickelson were only able to get within three shots at any point in the round. Spieth's total of 270 tied Tiger Woods in 1997 for lowest score in Masters history, and he became the first wire-to-wire Masters champion since Raymond Floyd in 1976. He got as low as 19-under after a birdie at the 15th, the first in Masters history to do so, before missing an 8-foot par putt at the 18th that would have broken the record. For the week, he recorded 28 birdies, three more than the previous tournament record set by Mickelson in 2001."

        "title": "Average earnings index (horse racing)",
        "text": "Average earnings index (AEI) is a popular statistic used in North American Thoroughbred horse breeding. It is used to put the earnings of a breeding animal's progeny into proper perspective.\nMethod.\nThe average earnings index measures the earning power of a stallion or mare's offspring by comparing the average earnings of a given horse's progeny with all other runners of the same age that raced in the same country in a given period of time. The average is stated as a value of 1.00. The AEI is calculated for each year a horse has offspring racing and can be averaged for all years that horse has had first generation descendants on the track.\nThe AEI can be used for additional comparisons, such as the composite AEI of a sire or damsire based on all of his progeny. Another way it is used is to compare stallions from one generation to the next, because it compensates for the changing value of currency over time.\nDevelopment.\nThe AEI was developed in 1948 by Joe Estes of \"The Blood-Horse\" magazine. It originally could only be used to calculate numbers for sires and, beginning in the 1950s, broodmare sires. It was only with the addition of computer power beginning in the 1970s and 1980s that a full analysis of mares could be added to the equations and determine the AEI for various crosses.\nCriticism.\nAlthough considered by some an industry standard, the AEI is criticized as easily skewed by the influence of a single exceptional horse in a given year and favors horses that throw \"durable types\" of horses that have multiple starts in a given year, including at lower-level races.\nExamples.\nA stallion's career AEI can be found by looking up the pedigree of any of their offspring in The Jockey Club's online pedigree database, equineline.com. The AEI figures for various leading American sires are: \nAs noted above, a stallion's career AEI can be found by looking up the pedigree of any of their offspring in The Jockey Club's online pedigree database, equineline.com. Sunday Silence's career AEI, according to the Jockey Club's online pedigree database (which includes all career earnings throughout the entire world), equineline.com, is 2.55. Sunday Silence's career AEI, according to Racing Post, is 2.15. However Racing Post warns details of horses trained outside GB and Ireland may be incomplete."

        "text": "John Butterfield (August 5, 1929 – November 16, 1979) was an American college baseball coach and professional baseball executive. Butterfield grew up in Westborough, Massachusetts and played college baseball for Maine in the early 1950s and later was the head coach at Maine and South Florida. In the late 1970s, he became an executive in the New York Yankees organization before he died in a car crash in November 1979.\nCoaching career.\nMaine.\nButterfield's coaching career began at Maine in 1956, when he assisted head coach Walter Anderson and coached the school's junior varsity team. For the 1957 season, Butterfield was named the head coach. He held the position from 1957–1974 and compiled an overall record of 240-169-2.\nMaine's best season under Butterfield was 1964, when the team went 21-8 and won the Yankee Conference outright to qualify for the program's first NCAA tournament. In the best-of-three District 1 Regional held in Boston, Maine swept Northeastern in two games to advance to the College World Series. There, Maine won its opening game against Seton Hall, 5-1, before dropping its second to Minnesota, 12-0. In the loser's bracket, the Black Bears defeated Arizona State and USC but were eliminated by Missouri and finished third. Butterfield was named NCAA Coach of the Year, and Joe Ferris was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nIn Butterfield's 17 seasons at Maine, the team won eight Maine State Series (a competition between Maine, Bowdoin, Colby, and Bates) and shared three other Yankee Conference titles, but did not qualify for another NCAA tournament.\nButterfield's players at Maine included Major Leaguers John Cumberland and Bert Roberge, college head coach Jack Leggett, baseball executive Bill Livesey, and New York Yankees manager Carl \"Stump\" Merrill. Butterfield coined Merrill's nickname during his freshman season in 1963.\nSouth Florida.\nFollowing the 1974 season, Butterfield left Maine to become the head coach at South Florida (USF), in part due to tension with Maine's administration over the program's funding. He coached at USF for two seasons (1975–1976) and had an overall record of 61-24-1. At USF, future Toronto Blue Jays manager Carlos Tosca was Butterfield's equipment manager.\nHead coaching record.\nBelow is a table of Butterfield's yearly records as a collegiate head baseball coach.\nProfessional baseball.\nIn 1976, Butterfield left USF at the request of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to become a scout for New York. The following year, he was named the organization's Director of Player Development and Scouting, a position he served in for the next three seasons.\nDeath.\nEarly on November 16, 1979, Butterfield was killed in a car crash in Paramus, New Jersey. His car crashed into a street sweeper stopped on the side of road. Steinbrenner said of his death: \"The magnitude of our loss cannot be expressed in words. He was the epitome of what you'd look for in a teacher of young men.\"\nPersonal.\nFamily.\nButterfield's son, Brian, played for him at Maine for one season and is currently a Major League Baseball coach for the Los Angeles Angels. Brian has also spent time as a coach with the Toronto Blue Jays and Boston Red Sox and in the Yankees and Diamondbacks minor league systems. Butterfield's brother, Jim, assisted him at Maine from 1957–1959 and later became the head football coach at Ithaca. Jim was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\nAwards named after.\nFollowing Butterfield's death in 1979, two awards were named for him. At Maine, the Jack Butterfield Memorial Scholarship is given to baseball players who \"have demonstrated academic proficiency, athletic leadership and the high ideals and standards\" of Butterfield. Past recipients include Major Leaguers Mike Bordick, Mark Sweeney, Bill Swift, and Larry Thomas. Also, the New England Intercollegiate Baseball Association (NEIBA) gives the Jack Butterfield Award to a coach who exhibits \"integrity and dedication to the game.\" Past recipients include Maine's John Winkin, Vermont's Bill Currier, and Northeastern's Neil McPhee."

School officials said that none of the conduct occurred after 2012, and no current student-athlete is involved.

        "title": "Rowing at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at Misari Regatta, South Korea. The event was held from 19 to 24 September. It was the 20th appearance of the event, which had been held at every Olympic Games since the introduction of rowing in 1900. NOCs were limited to one boat apiece; 22 sent a competitor in the men's single sculls. Thomas Lange of East Germany won the event, denying Pertti Karppinen a record fourth-straight win and starting a two-Games winning streak (and three-Games medal streak) of his own. Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany took his third silver (after 1976 and 1984), joining Karppinen and Vyacheslav Ivanov as three-time medalists in the event (three other men, including Lange, have joined that group since, as of the 2016 Games). New Zealand earned its first medal in the event since 1920, with Eric Verdonk taking bronze.\nBackground.\nDue to boycotts in 1980 and 1984, this was the first time since 1976 that all of the strongest rowing nations were present. The single sculls field included Finland's Pertti Karppinen (three-time defending gold medalist in 1976, 1980, and 1984), East Germany's Thomas Lange (then-current world champion, in his first Olympic appearance), and West Germany's Peter-Michael Kolbe (silver medalist behind Karppinen in 1976 and 1984, and five-time world champion). Andrew Sudduth of the United States had won a silver medal in 1984 in the eight; Dirk Crois of Belgium similarly changed events from 1984, when he took silver in double sculls. Other Olympic veterans were France's Pascal Body (5th in quadruple sculls in 1984), Brazil's Denis Marinho (7th in coxed four in 1984), and Puerto Rico's Juan Felix (10th in this event in 1984).\nKuwait, the Philippines, and South Korea each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 16th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 22 boats were divided into four heats for the quarterfinals, with 5 or 6 boats in each heat. The winning boat in each heat (4 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 18 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured four heats of 4 or 5 boats each, with the top two boats in each heat (8 boats total) advancing to the semifinals and the remaining 10 boats (4th and 5th placers in the repechage) being eliminated. The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining rowers competed in the repechage round for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe two fastest rowers in each repechage heat advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe three fastest rowers in each semifinal advanced to the \"A\" final, while the others went to the \"B\" final."

A backrow forward, Johnstone represented Ashburton County while serving in the army and later Otago at a provincial level. He was a member of the New Zealand national side, the All Blacks, from 1949 to 1951. He played 26 matches for the All Blacks—10 as captain—including nine internationals, touring South Africa in 1949 and playing all four tests against the touring 1950 British Lions.\nJohnstone was a key member of the Otago Ranfurly Shield team from 1947 to 1950. He continued to support the Taieri club after his playing days and was coach of the first Taieri team to win the Dunedin premier banner, sharing it with University A in 1955.\nJohnstone saw that the Taieri club needed a better ground and clubrooms, and he used his bridge-building business to help develop the new ground beside the Silverstream. It was named in his honour. The club has the best grounds in Otago and they are used when inner-city grounds were too wet to play on. The clubrooms are among the biggest in Dunedin.\nJohnstone was an Otago selector from 1959 to 1961 and also served as president of the Otago Rugby Football Union."

Eisenhower, who was accompanied by Pakistan's president Ayub Khan, became the first American President to watch Test cricket. According to Arunabha Sengupta, the day proved challenging for Pakistan who managed just 104 runs for the loss of five wickets, with Hanif Mohammed putting up the lone resistance against Australian bowlers. \nThe U.S. President, who was seen \"cheering the rare attacking strokes\" and applauding every \"decent effort in the field\", used the occasion for cricket diplomacy – signing a cricket bat and sporting a Pakistan blazer. When Australian captain Richie Benaud saw Eisenhower wearing the blazer, he jokingly remarked: \"Mr President… you have joined the other camp.\" \nThe Karachi Test and the First Test in Dhaka were played on matting pitches. Benaud and the Australian team's manager, Sam Loxton, took the opportunity when meeting the two presidents to plead that Pakistan abandon matting pitches, as the standard of play on matting was inferior. Ayub Khan subsequently decreed that Pakistan's Tests would in future all be played on turf pitches, so the Karachi Test was the last anywhere to be played on matting."

        "title": "List of 2014 FIFA World Cup controversies",
        "text": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil generated various controversies, including demonstrations, some of which took place even before the tournament started. Most centred on officiating, with referees coming under criticism for their performances. Furthermore, there were various issues with safety, including eight deaths of workers and a fire during construction, breaches into stadiums, an unstable makeshift staircase at the Maracanã Stadium, a monorail collapse, and the collapse of an unfinished overpass in Belo Horizonte. The most notable disciplinary case was that of Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez, who was disciplined after biting an Italian player, defender Giorgio Chiellini, during a game.\nBefore the tournament.\nProtests.\nPrior to the opening ceremony of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup staged in Brazil, demonstrations took place outside the venue, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup. Both President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff and FIFA President Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to give their speeches at the 2013 tournament's opening, which resulted in FIFA announcing that the 2014 World Cup opening ceremony would not feature any speeches. Further protests took place outside other matches during the Confederations Cup as part of wider unrest and rioting in Brazilian cities, seeking to express disenchantment with the government's financial management of the country.\nThe weeks preceding the 2014 World Cup, as well as the first days of the tournament, featured further unrest and protests across the country against the spending. Unlike at the Confederations Cup, however, security forces managed to prevent any protests from reaching the stadiums.\nWhile covering a protest for CNN during the 12 June opening game, reporter Shasta Darlington and producer Barbara Arvanitidis were injured. Arvanitidis was directly hit on the wrist by a tear-gas bomb while they were reporting the indiscriminate use of riot weapons.\nBlatter said that the protesters \"should not use football to make their demands heard\", and that the public expenditure on staging the tournaments was on \"items that are for the future, not just for the World Cup\". President Rousseff responded with a public address in which she stated, \"The federal money spent on the stadiums is in the form of financing that will be duly repaid by the companies and governments that are exploiting these stadiums.\"\nA mural by street artist Paulo Ito became a global viral phenomenon in the month before the World Cup. The spray paint and latex work depicted a black child sobbing at a dinner table, with nothing on his plate but a football. Ito intended the mural to focus on the FIFA issue, but worldwide it was often interpreted as a general attack on President Rousseff and the Workers' Party, an idea that Ito called simply \"stupid\".\nFormer Brazilian footballer and now political figure Romário labelled the tournament \"the biggest theft in history\", saying that he believed its real cost would exceed R$100 billion (£26 billion/€32 billion/US$45 billion). He called for a deeper investigation into the widespread misuse of public funds, which he identified as the reason for the continuing protests. Nevertheless, he was criticised by the ruling Workers' Party for receiving R$1 million to appear in two TV advertisements which promoted the World Cup.\nDirectly before the tournament, President Rousseff reiterated her assurances of the previous year that all the implemented public works had long-term benefits for Brazilians.\nBudweiser bill.\nAfter numerous deaths in football stadiums, Brazil passed a law in 2003 outlawing alcohol sales in stadiums. FIFA demanded that Brazil allow alcohol sales at the World Cup because Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor, was the \"Official Beer of the FIFA World Cup\", a role it had played since 1986. In response, Brazil passed a law paving the way for alcohol sales in the World Cup, nicknamed the \"Budweiser Bill\".\nSeeding of France.\nThere was some controversy before the draw when FIFA decided upon their allocation of the draw pots. Only eight sides were seeded for the World Cup draw: the hosts plus the seven sides ranked highest in the October 2013 FIFA World Rankings. The remaining 24 unseeded sides were allocated to three pots based on their geographical locations. However, there were still nine unseeded European sides, which meant that one European side had to be allocated to Pot 2, which otherwise consisted of African and South American sides. A similar situation arose with the 2006 World Cup seeding, and on that occasion the lowest ranked European side at the time of the draw, Serbia and Montenegro, were placed in the alternative pot.\nFor the 2014 draw, FIFA decided that the European team in Pot 2 would be drawn there randomly. France would have been the lowest ranked side, and many thought, based on the 2006 precedent, that the rule change benefitted them.\nMany officials, fans, and journalists complained, pointing out that a Frenchman, FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke, suggested the change, and suspecting that another influential Frenchman, UEFA president Michel Platini, helped approve it. Instead, Italy were drawn into Pot 2 and ended up in a difficult group. The next day, a headline in the Italian sports periodical \"Corriere Dello Sport\" read, \"2014 World Cup draw: What a scandal!\".\nGroup stage.\nBrazil vs Croatia.\nThe Japanese referee Yuichi Nishimura faced heavy criticism for his performance in the Group A opening match between Croatia and the host team Brazil as several decisions favoured the host nation.\nIn the 71st minute, the Croatian defender Dejan Lovren put his hands below the Brazilian striker Fred's arms in the Croatian penalty area, after which Fred fell down. Nishimura awarded Brazil a penalty kick which Neymar converted for their second goal in a 3–1 win. The call was condemned by various sources, including former top-level FIFA referees, newspaper writers, players from other teams and fans in Nishimura's home country, saying that Lovren's contact was minimal and that Fred went down on his own. Twelve minutes later, the Croatians had an equaliser controversially disallowed for a supposed foul by Croatian forward Ivica Olić on the Brazilian goalkeeper Júlio César.\nEarlier in the game, in the 26th minute, Neymar elbowed the Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić, after which Neymar was shown a yellow card. At that time Croatia were leading the game 1–0. Many critics agreed that Neymar's punishment was too lenient and that Neymar should have been shown a red card.\nRenowned former top-level FIFA referee Markus Merk questioned FIFA's appointment of Nishimura in the opening match, labelling the refereeing as \"embarrassing\". Massimo Busacca, the head of refereeing development at FIFA, defended Nishimura's penalty kick decision and insisted that Dejan Lovren's contact was significant enough.\nMexico vs Cameroon: Giovani's two disallowed goals.\nIn the Group A game between Mexico and Cameroon, Mexican midfielder Giovani dos Santos had two goals wrongly disallowed for offside in the first half. Replays showed that he was in line with the second to last defender for the first, while the ball came from a deliberate play by a Cameroonian player for the second. Following the game, which Mexico won 1–0, Amy Lawrence of \"The Guardian\" described the tournament as having \"incompetent officiating\", and called for FIFA president Sepp Blatter to allow team managers to challenge two decisions per match with video review, a possibility that Blatter discussed before the tournament. On 20 June 2014, FIFA announced that they had removed the Colombian assistant referee responsible for the incidents, Humberto Clavijo, from further officiating at the tournament.\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nBoth Brazilian and Mexican fans abused each other with homophobic chants during the match.\nSpain vs Netherlands: Behaviour of Diego Costa.\nMuch attention ahead of the tournament had focused on the switch of Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to Spain. Costa returned to his native land for his World Cup debut, only for his new team to lose 5–1 to the Netherlands in their opening game in Group B. Jeers and insults were heard from the local fans throughout the match. Costa also noticeably headbutted his opponent Bruno Martins Indi during the game and was subsequently substituted by his coach Vicente del Bosque for striker Fernando Torres.\nGermany vs Portugal.\nIn the Group G game between Germany and Portugal, there were some contentious decisions by the Serbian referee, Milorad Mažić.\nIn the 12th minute, Mažić awarded Germany a penalty as the Portuguese defender João Pereira held back the German midfielder Mario Götze, and gave Pereira a yellow card for the foul. The Portuguese players, including a very agitated Pepe, surrounded Mažić in protest. Germany's Thomas Müller scored the penalty to give Germany team a 1–0 lead. The penalty call was questioned by Portugal's coach Paulo Bento, who called it \"forced\". \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s Mark Ogden labelled it \"another example of questionable refereeing at this World Cup as contact appeared slight, certainly not enough to force Götze, who made the most of the challenge, off his feet\".\nIn the 37th minute, Portuguese defender Pepe headbutted Thomas Müller,\nand was shown a straight red card.\nThe former World Cup referee Brian Hall condemned Müller for using theatrical action to \"gain unfair advantage\" by \"tricking the referee\".\nThe situation turned out to be the match's biggest talking point with observer reaction generally centred on the condemnation of Pepe's actions and whether Müller overemphasised the initial contact.\nIn the 75th minute, Mažić failed to award a penalty kick to Portugal, prompting much irritation from the players. Germany ended up winning 4–0, with Müller scoring three goals. In his post-match comments, Bento said Mažić showed \"bias\" on both occasions, adding, \"I am not saying it was only the referee's fault. We also made mistakes but the circumstances of what happened in the first half made the rest of the game difficult for us...The sending-off was forced on the player. I don't know if it was because of Pepe's reputation. It depends what sort of a reputation you think Pepe has.\"\nCameroon vs Croatia: Assou-Ekotto headbutts his teammate.\nMuch attention was given to apparent action of Benoît Assou-Ekotto to headbutt his Cameroonian teammate, Benjamin Moukandjo. The incident was seemingly missed by officials but was captured on playback. Assou-Ekotto later attributed this to frustration. Cameroon's Alex Song also earned a red card by elbowing Croatian forward Mario Mandžukić in the back in the same game.\nItaly vs Costa Rica: Chiellini kicks Campbell.\nIn the Group D game between Italy and Costa Rica, Costa Rican forward Joel Campbell was kicked by Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in the penalty area while looking for a goal, but Chilean referee Enrique Osses failed to award a penalty, enraging Costa Rica's coach Jorge Luis Pinto. Shortly afterwards, Pinto decided to charge at the referee's assistant, with Costa Rica's staff and substitutes following his lead. Former World Cup referee Graham Poll later tweeted, \"HUGE moment in this match, how have Costa Rica not got a penalty?! Joel Campbell gets behind the Italy defence to race through on goal before he is clumsily brought down by a push from Giorgio Chiellini.\" Nevertheless, Costa Rican midfielder Bryan Ruiz scored a goal within a minute, which was eventually the game winner for Costa Rica as they won 1–0.\nArgentina vs Iran.\nDuring the Group F game between Argentina and Iran, Serbian referee Milorad Mažić allegedly failed to award a penalty kick that would have favoured Iran. In addition to sparking a furious response from the Iranian players who rushed and bumped the referee, Mažić's non-call on Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta's penalty area challenge on Iranian midfielder Ashkan Dejagah in the 55th minute produced a post-match discussion on whether a foul had been committed. Iranian print media, including the \"Jam-e-jam\", \"Quds\", and \"Iran\" daily newspapers, lambasted Mažić over his decision not to award a penalty shot, citing him as the reason Argentina won the match, Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey of Pravda.ru declared Mažić \"either biased or incompetent\" before proclaiming his 55th minute decision \"a disgusting comment on the quality of referees chosen to manage the games of the FIFA World Cup\", \"Metro\" wrote that despite Zabaleta getting his toe to the ball when tackling Dejagah, \"replays showed Iran should've been awarded a spot-kick\", SB Nation's Kim McCauley felt Dejagah had a \"strong claim for a penalty\". However, \"The Guardian\"'s Barney Ronay and the Associated Press's Karl Ritter wrote in their reports that television replays suggest Zabaleta had gotten a touch on the ball first before bringing down Dejagah and therefore did not foul the Iranian. \"The Daily Telegraph\" also thought that the call was correct: \"[Dejagah] is screaming for a penalty, so much so that he almost manhandles the referee in his frustration. I've no idea why, as replays suggest Zabaleta won the ball, albeit a little clumsily.\"\nIran's coach Carlos Queiroz questioned the 55th-minute non-call in his post-match comments, saying, \"It should have been a penalty and red card. There's no excuse. There's nothing that can explain [why] this Serbian referee [did] not give the penalty. How can this guy sleep tonight, or for the rest of his life? With all respect, I would like to have the opportunity to have a one-on-one conversation with him. Why did he do that to us?\" Argentina's coach Alejandro Sabella supported Mažić's non-call, feeling that Zabaleta got the ball first in his challenge.\nNigeria vs Bosnia and Herzegovina: Džeko's disallowed goal.\nDuring the Group F match between Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina, New Zealand referee Peter O'Leary disallowed a goal to Bosnia and Herzegovina due to an incorrect offside call from his assistant. Nigeria won the game 1–0, which meant that Bosnia and Herzegovina were mathematically eliminated from advancing to the knockout stage. The referee was later pictured appearing to celebrate with Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama after the match's end, an incident that Bosnian forward Edin Džeko, the scorer of the disallowed goal, called \"shameful\".\nOn 9 November 2014, Peter O'Leary, the game referee speaking to \"The New Zealand Herald\" admitted Džeko's goal was disallowed in error.\nGreece vs Ivory Coast.\nIn the final Group C game between Greece and Ivory Coast, Ecuadorean referee Carlos Vera awarded Greece a late penalty kick in the 91st minute of the match when he called a foul on Ivory Coast forward Giovanni Sio in a play where replays showed that Greek midfielder Georgios Samaras stubbed his foot into the pitch after the contact and fell down, which has been seen as controversial. Samaras converted the subsequent penalty kick to give Greece a 2–1 victory, which meant that they would advance on to the knockout stage. Had the penalty not been called, Ivory Coast would have advanced in a 1–1 draw. FIFA, however, accepted the penalty by appointing the referee as Fourth Official on the Final.\nCroatia vs Mexico.\nDuring the Group A match between Croatia and Mexico, the Uzbek referee Ravshan Irmatov declined awarding a penalty after a possible handball by the Croatian defender Darijo Srna and did not send off Rafael Márquez, who later scored the first goal.\nItaly vs Uruguay: Claudio Marchisio's red card and Luis Suárez biting incident.\nIn the 59th minute, the Italian midfielder Claudio Marchisio made a high challenge on Egidio Arévalo Ríos and was shown a straight red card by the referee. Italy's coach Cesare Prandelli argued against this decision and claimed that the Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez had been showing bias against Italy, which had ruined the game for the Azzurri.\nIn the 79th minute of the match, Uruguay's striker Luis Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder, after which Suárez fell and clutched his face. As the Italian players protested to Rodríguez for not penalising Suárez, Uruguay won a corner and their defender Diego Godín scored. The game finished 1–0 to Uruguay, allowing them to qualify to the knockout stage as the Group D runners-up. Italy, who had also lost their previous game, were eliminated, finishing third in the group. It was the second successive time they had failed to qualify past the group stage in a World Cup, having won it in 2006. FIFA announced later the same day that it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Suárez.\nSuárez had been found guilty of biting opponents on two previous occasions: Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Branislav Ivanović in 2013. He received a seven-game ban for the first incident and a ten-game ban for the second, where he was criticised for not recognising \"the seriousness\" of it.\nOn 26 June 2014, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity, including entering any stadium, for four months and fined CHF100,000 (approx. £65,700/€82,000/US$119,000). The severity of the penalty was due to the fact that it was Suárez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse. With Suárez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 2–0 to Colombia and were knocked out of the World Cup.\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal against the decision. Suárez's lawyer claimed that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Suárez. Various Uruguayan individuals defended Suárez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticised the severity of his ban, including the President of Uruguay José Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\"; the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) president Wilmar Valdez, Uruguay's captain Diego Lugano and their coach Óscar Tabárez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest. The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood. Chiellini called the ban \"excessive\", while the international players' union FIFPro called for Suárez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Suárez.\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Suárez apologised to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating that all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Suárez's suspension.\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed against Suárez's ban, but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July. With the ban not preventing Suárez from transferring to another club, it was announced on 11 July that Suárez had agreed to move to Barcelona. Before the transfer, Barcelona's club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honourable\", their sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Suárez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" and their new signing Ivan Rakitić commended Suárez's \"character and strength\".\nAlgeria vs Russia: laser used against Russian goalkeeper.\nThe final group stage match between Algeria and Russia on 26 June ended 1–1, thus advancing Algeria to the knockout stage and eliminating Russia. A win for Russia would have seen them qualify, and they led the game 1–0 after six minutes with a goal from forward Aleksandr Kokorin. In the 60th minute of the game, a moving green light – most likely produced by a laser pointer – was shone in Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev's face while he was defending from an Algerian free-kick, which striker Islam Slimani scored from to equalise. Russia's coach Fabio Capello blamed the laser for the decisive conceded goal, saying, \"The goalkeeper was unable to do his job. The laser was in his face. It is not an excuse. You can see the footage.\"\nAfter the match, the Algerian Football Federation (AFF) was fined CHF50,000 (approx. £33,000/€41,100/US$56,200) by FIFA for the use of lasers and other violations of the rules by Algerian fans in the stadium. Laser pointers were a prohibited item in the stadium, according to FIFA Stadium Safety and Security Regulations.\nKnockout stage.\nBrazil vs Chile.\nThe first Round of 16 match, between Brazil and Chile, resulted in some confusions and controversies.\nThere was some doubt if the first goal of the match, scored by Brazil, was an own goal by Chile defender Gonzalo Jara, although FIFA confirmed that the goal was scored by Brazil's David Luiz.\nEnglish referee Howard Webb was criticised for calls which might have been too close or harsh, especially against Brazil: BBC Sport commentator and former England striker Gary Lineker said in a video that Webb made some \"iffy decisions\", such as denying a penalty kick award to Brazil forward Hulk at 13 minutes \"that looked like it possibly was\", and calling a handball against the same player at 55 minutes that was \"a little bit harsh\". Hulk had put the ball into Chile's net, but the referee ruled that he had controlled the ball using his arm. The goal was disallowed and he was shown the yellow card. Other commentators (including former England footballer Michael Owen, via Twitter) also questioned the handball decision against Hulk (made by English assistant referee Michael Mullarkey) as being a call which might have been too close.\nBrazilian coach Scolari criticized the refereeing, mentioning that opposition teams were trying to injure Neymar, saying he had experienced the same thing with Cristiano Ronaldo when he was coaching Portugal.\nNetherlands vs Mexico.\nWith the score 0–0, one minute into stoppage time of the first half of the Round of 16 match between Mexico and the Netherlands, Mexican defenders Rafael Márquez and Héctor Moreno double fouled Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who was in possession of the ball in the penalty box. Portuguese referee Pedro Proença waved to \"play on\", though Moreno's foul was so hard that he broke his own shinbone and had to be stretchered off the field.&lt;br&gt;\nWhile the score was 1–1, one minute into stoppage time of the second half, Robben again went down inside the area following another foul by Márquez, in which Márquez stepped on Robben's foot. This time the Netherlands was given a penalty kick, which striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar converted for the game-winning goal, eliminating Mexico with a 2–1 win. Robben, who has a reputation for diving, was condemned widely in the press for his \"theatrical fall\" to earn the decisive penalty.\nAfter the match, Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera was seen arguing with referee Proença and later claimed, in an interview, \"This was a World Cup where everyone was against Mexico.\" After the match, Robben admitted to going to ground too easily once during the game and said, \"I must apologize. The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one just outside the box I went to ground too easily. I shouldn't be doing that.\" Robben also said that the pair of fouls against him, while he was inside the box during the first half, should have been awarded a penalty. Márquez claimed that Robben confessed to him at the end of the match that \"it [the 90'+1 tackle] wasn't a penalty, though one of the previous was\"; the Royal Dutch Football Association suggested that Robben's words were mistranslated.\nIn the aftermath of the event, many Mexican fans used the phrase \"No era penal\" () for a number of years to refer to the moment. Robben offered a retorte in 2016 against those using said phrase saying to Grant Wahl \"you have to admit already in the first half they didn’t give me a penalty, and it should have been a penalty. And the penalty itself, it was a penalty.\"\nFrance vs Nigeria.\nAfter the Round of 16 match between France and Nigeria, American referee Mark Geiger was accused by multiple Nigerian players, most notably midfielders Ogenyi Onazi and John Obi Mikel, forward Peter Odemwingie, as well as by Nigeria's coach Stephen Keshi, of having bias against Nigeria. Geiger was criticised for several calls throughout the game. This included a goal by Nigerian striker Emmanuel Emenike being cancelled for offside (although television replays suggest this may have been the correct decision); no red card for an apparent attempt by French striker Olivier Giroud to elbow Nigerian midfielder Mikel, no penalty being called against French left-back Patrice Evra for holding Odemwingie during a corner, a general lack of protection from the referee for persistent rough play and, most notably, only a yellow card being issued for a studs-in tackle by French midfielder Blaise Matuidi, which resulted in midfielder Onazi's left leg tendon being torn apart and requiring surgery, and forced to be substituted for midfielder Reuben Gabriel. Several commentators like Allan Jiang of Bleacherreport and Patrick Johnson of Yahoo! News noted that the decisions significantly impacted the match, especially the forced substitution of Onazi, which changed the complexion of the game, depriving Nigeria of its most influential midfielder.\nBrazil vs Colombia.\nFilled with controversy, the quarter-final between Brazil and Colombia saw a record number of fouls for a match in this World Cup (31 committed by Brazil and 23 by Colombia, totaling 54, with only 4 yellow cards), including one committed by Colombian defender Juan Camilo Zúñiga as he kneed Brazilian forward Neymar in the back in the 88th minute, which resulted in the striker's withdrawal from the match. The action was not punished with a card nor even a foul. Subsequent medical evaluation discovered a fractured vertebra, forcing the Brazilian to miss the remainder of the tournament. After the match, which Colombia lost 2–1, Zúñiga insisted that he had not meant to injure Neymar. Neymar's teammate Thiago Silva defended Zúñiga, stating that he is not the type of player who would purposely cause an injury to any player. On 5 July, it was revealed that Zúñiga had sent a letter of apology to Neymar, saying that he was \"deeply sorry and sad\" for unintentionally causing the injury. On the other hand, Ronaldo believed that Zúñiga intended to hurt Neymar, saying that the very high knee in the back was violent and an unlawful move.\nMany media and football figures, such as Diego Maradona, criticised FIFA and the Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo, claiming \"favouritism\" towards Brazil, for disallowing a goal scored by Colombian defender Mario Yepes and allowing too many fouls by the Brazilians to occur without punishment, leading the Colombians to play aggressively as well. There have been arguments that had Carballo properly controlled the game, fewer fouls (as well as Neymar's injury) may have occurred.\nDespite the controversy, Colombia were awarded the FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the tournament.\nBrazil vs Netherlands.\nIn the second minute of the third-place play-off, Thiago Silva pulled down Arjen Robben as he ran into Júlio César's box with the ball for a clear goal-scoring opportunity. Under IFAB laws, Silva ought to have been shown a red card, but he was shown a yellow card instead by the Algerian referee Djamel Haimoudi. The referee called for a penalty, while the foul happened outside the box, which was eventually scored by Robin van Persie. The Netherlands' second goal in the 16th minute was later shown to be offside, which was ignored by the referees. Haimoudi had another controversial call in the 67th minute when he showed Brazilian midfielder Oscar a yellow card for diving, the only such instance in this tournament when replays showed that he was taken down in the box by opponent Daley Blind.\nGermany vs Argentina.\nIn the second half of the final, German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer collided with Gonzalo Higuaín in mid-air while trying to punch the ball out inside the penalty box. Referee Nicola Rizzoli decided against the call for a penalty kick, and concluded that Gonzalo Higuain had fouled Neuer, so he gave Germany a free-kick. Some people felt Neuer should have been shown a red card and Argentina awarded a penalty.\nSafety.\nConstruction.\nStadium construction for the 2014 World Cup was plagued by accidents, cost overruns and delays, with eight workers dying in various accidents while building the World Cup's 12 arenas. In late October 2013, a fire during construction of the Arena Pantanal at Cuiabá in Mato Grosso state came 24 hours after the state governor warned the stadium might not be 100 percent complete in time for the deadline. Footage also emerged of fans climbing what appeared to be an unstable staircase made with scaffolding leading to the Maracanã Stadium, before the Argentina–Bosnia and Herzegovina match.\nBreaches into stadiums.\nAt Chile's Group B match against Spain on 18 June, about 100 Chilean supporters who had gathered outside Maracanã Stadium forced their way in. They broke through security, after one fan pretended to be sick to distract the guard. They proceeded into the media centre, smashed the glass door, knocked over two partition walls and entered the stadium. Military police reported that 85 Chileans were detained during the events, while others had reached the stands. Earlier, on 15 June, about 20 Argentinians made a similar breach during the Argentina–Bosnia and Herzegovina match at the same stadium.\nViolence between England fans.\nOn 19 June during England's match against Uruguay in São Paulo, an England football supporter was assaulted and had a piece of his ear bitten off by another England fan, British police reported. Brazilian officers started an investigation after the attacked fan made a complaint, but the assailant could not be identified. The confirmation of the incident came after former England striker Stan Collymore tweeted that he had seen footage of a \"fan attacked\". The Association of Chief Police Officers issued a statement, following Collymore's tweet, with Chief Superintendent Rachel Barber of South Yorkshire Police saying, \"Efforts are ongoing to identify the suspect and bring him to justice either in the UK or, if possible, back in Brazil where the offence occurred\".\nMonorail collapse.\nOn 9 June, three days before the World Cup started, a concrete support beam collapsed during construction of Line 17 of the São Paulo Metro, killing one worker and injuring two others. Completion for the line, which would connect Congonhas-São Paulo Airport to three other lines in the monorail network, was scheduled for the start of the tournament, but construction was delayed as it did not receive environmental approvals, and was expected to be completed by the second half of 2015.\nBridge collapse.\nOn 3 July, an overpass under construction in Belo Horizonte as part of the World Cup infrastructure projects collapsed onto a busy carriageway below, leaving two people dead and 22 others injured. One witness blamed the accelerated construction schedules and the \"incompetence\" of the authorities and businesses for the disaster.\nHead injuries.\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious. The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.\nSecond, in the final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.\nAftermath.\nThere was controversy over Germany's victory celebration, which included a parody of the Argentina Gaucho. This event was later termed as \"Gauchogate\".\nAs the national team arrived to the fan zone at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on 15 July 2014, six players, Roman Weidenfeller, Shkodran Mustafi, André Schürrle, Miroslav Klose, Mario Götze and Toni Kroos sang a victory song with the chorus of nursery rhyme it\" I know a cowboy, the cowboy is called Bill\". They modified it and sang, \"That's how the Gauchos go, the gauchos go like that\" in a stooped posture. When changing to the second verse they took a more upright posture and sang, \"and that's how the Germans go, the Germans go like that\". Just a few hours later, the name \"Gauchogate\" went viral on Twitter for the response to this action.\nMany German newspapers criticized the celebration in the press. Die Zeit ran an article with the title \"Embarrassing appearance at victory party\", Die Welt called it a \"crazy idea\", Die Tageszeitung called it \"disrespectful\", and Faz.net said the celebration was \"a gigantic own goal\". The critics ranged from appeasement, that it was only a harmless song being sung in the intoxication of joy, to the classification as a mockery of the World Cup final opponent by calling their people short and Germans \"superior\". The Argentine sports newspaper \"Olé\" described the scene as a real controversy. Sports journalist Víctor Hugo Morales, through Radio Continental in Buenos Aires, called the six players who danced, \"disgusting Nazis\".\nGerman Football Association president Wolfgang Niersbach said the dance wasn't meant to be \"disrespectful\", also adding that it was instead a \"spontaneous expression of happiness\" from the players."

        "title": "2014–15 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2014–15 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They were led by 11th year head coach John Thompson III, were members of the Big East Conference, and played their home games at the Verizon Center. They finished the season 22–11, 12–6 in Big East play to finish in a tie for second place. They advanced to the semifinals of the Big East tournament where they lost to Xavier. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Eastern Washington in the second round before losing in the third round to Utah.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the previous season 18–15, 8–10 in Big East play, to finish in seventh place. They lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to DePaul. They were invited to the 2014 National Invitation Tournament, in which they lost in the second round to Florida State.\nSeason recap.\nSince the conclusion of the previous season, Georgetown had lost four players to graduation: Most notably, point guard Markel Starks, who had finished the 2013–2014 season as the team's second-leading scorer, had graduated, as had forward Nate Lubick and reserve guard John Caprio. The fourth graduate was Moses Ayegba who, after three years as a reserve center at Georgetown, had opted to transfer to Nebraska to play out his final year of collegiate eligibility.\nReturning for 2014–2015 were the team's leading scorer from 2013–2014, junior guard D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera – a shooting guard while Starks was on the team but taking on point guard duties this season – as well as junior guard Jabril Trawick, senior forward Mikael Hopkins, sophomore power forward Reggie Cameron, and junior reserve center Bradley Hayes. Reserve forward Aaron Bowen, a redshirt senior the previous season, had a year of collegiate eligibility remaining due to a freshman season cut short by surgery, and, although he had the option of transferring elsewhere to play out his eligibility without sitting out a season, he opted to play at Georgetown in 2014–2015 as a fifth-year senior. Two junior guards made the team as walk-ons, David Allen for the third straight season and Riyan Williams, the son of former Georgetown great Reggie Williams, who had walked on the previous season and had made the roster in January 2014. Senior center Tyler Adams, sidelined early in his freshman season by heart arrhythmia, spent the season on a medical hardship waiver that allowed him to continue at Georgetown on a scholarship without counting against the team's scholarship total. Relegated to the bench for another year, he made the most of the situation, acting as a \"de facto\" assistant coach, although he made a brief appearance on the court in Georgetown's final home game of the season.\nMost notably, senior center Joshua Smith returned. Criticism that he lacked maturity and a commitment to physical fitness and to playing winning basketball had dogged Smith earlier in his collegiate career when he spent parts of three seasons at UCLA, and John Thompson III had suspended him the previous season for academic reasons after only 13 games with the Hoyas; that suspension had become an outright dismissal from the team shortly afterward when he continued to struggle in his classes, although the dismissal came with the understanding that he could return for the 2014–2015 season if his grades improved enough. By the fall 2014 semester, he had resolved his academic problems, and Georgetown allowed him to rejoin the team for the 2014–2015 season. When suspended, he had been the 2013–2014 team's third-leading scorer and was a key part of Georgetown's offense, and his departure that season had led to a steep drop in the 2013–2014's team's fortunes. Although Smith's performance had declined noticeably during the last few games before his suspension, he and Smith-Rivera were the only returning Georgetown players who had averaged in double figures for the 2013–2014 season. Arriving in the fall of 2014 30 pounds (13.6 kg) lighter than the year before and having undergone an offseason fitness regimen, Smith again was expected to serve as the centerpiece of Georgetown's offense.\nFive freshmen – guard Tre Campbell, small forward L. J. Peak, and forwards Isaac Copeland, Paul White, and Trey Mourning – joined the team. Mourning was the son of former Georgetown and National Basketball Association great Alonzo Mourning, and his arrival marked the fourth time in Georgetown basketball history that the son of a former player had joined the team.\nNonconference schedule.\nGeorgetown began its season with three wins at the Verizon Center, defeating St. Francis Brooklyn, Texas A&amp;M–Corpus Christi, and Robert Morris. Facing St. Francis Brooklyn in his first game as a Hoya, L. J. Peak went 9-for-9 from the field, including a three-pointer, and 4-for-8 from the free-throw line to finish with 23 points, while Jabril Trawick added 11 points, Joshua Smith – returning to action for the first time since January 4, 2014 – scored 10, and Mikael Hopkins grabbed 10 rebounds. Against Texas A&amp;M–Corpus Christi four days later, Smith had the first double-double of his Georgetown career, scoring 20 points and pulling down 12 rebounds, and Aaron Bowen came off the bench for 13 points and five steals, while Hopkins scored 12 points and Peak 10. Smith had another double-double in the Robert Morris game, scoring 22 points and grabbing 11 rebounds against the Colonials, and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had his first double-figure outing of the season as he and Peak scored 12 points each, while Hopkins pulled down 10 rebounds and scored six points. Robert Morris junior guard Rodney Pryor, who two years later would play for Georgetown during the 2016–2017 season, came off the bench for a team-high 16 points for the Colonials.\nNext, the Hoyas left the United States to play in the Battle 4 Atlantis, an annual tournament held at Atlantis Paradise Island on Paradise Island in Nassau in the Bahamas. In the tournament's opening quarterfinal round, they faced their first ranked opponent of the season, No. 18 Florida. It was the first time the teams had met since November 2012, when their game was canceled after the first half due to condensation on the court and never completed, and it was the first game they completed against one another since Florida's 2006 national championship team knocked the Hoyas out of the 2006 NCAA tournament. The game was a wild one that saw 21 lead changes. The Hoyas held the Gators to 36 percent shooting from the field, and although no Hoya scored more than six points in the first half, Georgetown went into the locker room at halftime with a 31–27 lead. Joshua Smith was called for two flagrant fouls during the game, one of which allowed Florida senior forward Jacob Kurtz to sink one of two free throws and give Florida a 44–42 lead with 7:07 left in regulation. Jabril Trawick fouled out with 34.1 seconds left in regulation, but shortly afterward the Hoya defense collapsed on Florida redshirt junior guard Eli Carter to prevent him from scoring, and the second half ended with the teams tied 53–53. In overtime, Gator sophomore guard Kasey Hill completed a three-point play with 11.5 seconds remaining to put Florida ahead 65–64, but D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored on a jumper with 3.4 seconds left to give Georgetown a 66–65 upset win. The game continued a streak that made 2014–2015 the first season since 1949-1950 that Florida had not scored at least 70 points in any of its first four games. Smith-Rivera had a game-high 17 points, while Paul White had his first double-digit game as a Hoya with 10 points and Jabril Trawick also scored 10 before fouling out.\nGeorgetown advanced to the semifinals to meet an even more challenging opponent, No. 2 Wisconsin, which had defeated UAB easily in the first round. The game was the first meeting between Wisconsin and Georgetown since December 28, 1982. The Hoyas made their first six shots and by halfway through the first half were shooting 61 percent from the field and leading 19–16; Georgetown led for all but 56 seconds of the first half, but Wisconsin led 35–34 at halftime. Wisconsin fell behind in the second half, the first time all season the Badgers had trailed in the second half of a game, and Georgetown built a lead of nine points, 53–44, with 11:36 left to play. But Georgetown missed eight of its last 10 shots while the Badgers went on a decisive 22–6 run – during which Badger redshirt senior forward Duje Dukan scored all eight of his points in the game over a stretch of 80 seconds – to pull ahead 62–59 with 4:27 left to play and 66–59 with 1:53 remaining. D'Vauntes Smith Rivera, who had made all five of his previous three-point attempts, missed his last one, a potential game-tying shot which rimmed out as time expired, and, although Georgetown held the lead for all but 9 minutes 20 seconds of the game, Wisconsin came away with a 68–65 win and advanced to play Oklahoma in the tournament's championship game. The game saw 29 turnovers, 15 of them Georgetown's, and Wisconsin took decisive advantage of free-throw opportunities, going 13-for-18 (72.2 percent) from the line to Georgetown's 1-for-2. Smith-Rivera had a game-high 29 points, and Joshua Smith was the only other Hoya to score in double digits with 10 points.\nGeorgetown moved on to the third-place game, meeting Big East rival Butler, which had beaten North Carolina in the quarterfinals and lost to Oklahoma in its semifinal game. Although NCAA rules ordinarily precluded two teams from the same conference from playing in the same early-season tournament, Butler received a waiver to play in the Battle 4 Atlantis because it did not decide to join the new Big East Conference until after accepting an invitation to the tournament. From the field, Butler had shot 49-for-119 (41.2 percent) in the tournament, including weak shooting early in the Georgetown game, but then the Bulldogs began making shots, pulling out to a 21–13 lead that was the first time in school history they ever had led the Hoyas by more than seven points, and shooting 9-for-11 during one stretch in the second half. Butler prevailed 64–58, Georgetown's first loss to Butler in four meetings all-time between the schools. Against the Bulldogs, Isaac Copeland scored in double figures for the first time in his collegiate career, shooting 7-for-10 from the field and scoring 16 points, while Paul White added 13, and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera finished with 12. The Hoyas had been called for at least 20 fouls in all three games they played in the Bahamas and were outscored 49-34 from the free-throw line; they had seen all three of their Battle 4 Atlantis games decided in the final minute and two of them on the final shot, and they went 1–2 and finished in fourth place in the 2014 Battle 4 Atlantis.\nAfter nine days off, the Hoyas opened a four-game homestand at the Verizon Center that began with an easy win over Towson in which five Hoyas scored in double figures, with D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera finishing with a game-high 16 points, Paul White with 14 – including 4-of-5 shooting from three-point range – Joshua Smith with 12, Jabril Trawick with 11, and Isaac Copeland with 10. It was Georgetown's first appearance in the annual BB&amp;T Classic. Three days later, they hosted No. 10 Kansas, their third ranked opponent of the season. During warm-ups, the national anthem, and pregame handshakes, the entire Georgetown roster wore black T-shirts emblazoned with \"I CAN′T BREATHE\" in white lettering, which Joshua Smith explained to reporters was an expression of sympathy to the family of Eric Garner, whose death while being arrested by New York City police officers in July 2014 was a matter of national controversy in the United States after a grand jury declined to indict the officers involved. Entering the game – the return visit for a home-and-home series in which Georgetown had traveled to play Kansas the previous season – the Jayhawks were 6–1 and had won five games in a row. The game had no flow, with 33 turnovers and 58 free throws taken by the two teams combined, and both Jayhawk sophomore guard Brannen Greene and Georgetown's Mikael Hopkins had four fouls by midway through the second half. Neither of the teams′ leading scorers – Perry Ellis for Kansas and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera for Georgetown – had a good offensive performance, Ellis going 4-for-15 (26.7 percent) and Smith-Rivera 3-for-15 (20.0 percent) from the field. Brannen Greene scored a career-high 19 points for Kansas, 16 of them in the second half, but Joshua Smith led all scorers with 20 points, while L. J. Peak had 18 and Paul White and Smith-Rivera contributed 10 each. Jabril Trawick suffered a bone bruise in a collision with Greene during the game. A key officiating decision came with 18 seconds left to play and Kansas leading 71–67, when the ball went out of bounds after Isaac Copeland missed a three-pointer and the referees could not determine whose possession it was; they decided to call it a jump ball, which, because of the alternating possession rule, gave the Jayhawks the ball. Greene promptly drew a foul by Copeland and made both free throws to give Kansas a 73–67 lead with 16 seconds left. The Jayhawks hung on for a 75–70 victory.\nThe homestand continued with an easy win over Radford in which Georgetown's bench players shined, scoring 42 points, with Aaron Bowen leading the way with a game-high and career-high 16 points and Paul White adding 12. Charlotte visited a week later and lost a much closer game in which the Hoyas had to turn back a last-second 49ers upset bid. In a balanced Georgetown attack, L. J. Peak led all scorers with 18 points, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 13, Joshua Smith scored 12, and Jabril Trawick had a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds, while Aaron Bowen came off the bench to add another 11 points.\nA week later, Georgetown rounded out its non-conference schedule by visiting Madison Square Garden to meet Indiana in the Indeed Invitational. Despite getting in early foul trouble, Joshua Smith played a key role in the Hoyas′ overtime win over the Hoosiers, scoring 14 points, while D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored a game-high 29, Aaron Bowen came off the bench to score 22 – a new career high for him – on 10-for-13 (76.9 percent) shooting from the field, and Jabril Trawick contributed 12. For the second season a row, the Hoyas finished their non-conference schedule with a record of 8–3. All three of their losses had come against teams either ranked at the time of the game or, in the case of Butler, soon afterward.\nConference schedule.\nThe Associated Press Poll ranked the Hoyas No. 25 at the end of December – their first national ranking since the final poll of the 2012-2013 season – just in time for the Big East Conference season to begin with a full slate of five games on December 31, 2014. Georgetown – picked pre-season by the Big East's coaches for the second season in a row to finish second in the conference – opened the season with a visit to Xavier, where D'Vauntes Smith Rivera, who entered the game as the conference's fifth-leading scorer, was booed throughout the game because Xavier had recruited him heavily and he had chosen Georgetown instead. Although the Hoyas held the Musketeers 11 points below their season scoring average, Xavier also held Georgetown to its lowest point total of the season, and Xavier won 70–53 in an upset despite 18 points by Smith-Rivera and 10 by Joshua Smith.\nThe Hoyas returned to the Verizon Center and began 2015 with two wins, beating Creighton and Marquette. In the Creighton game, with the Hoyas wearing pink shoelaces for Georgetown's second annual Men Against Breast Cancer game, Joshua Smith scored 14 points and Jabril Trawick added 12, but three freshman – L. J. Peak with 14 points, Tre Campbell with 13, and Paul White with 10 – combined for 37 of Georgetown's 76 points, including one stretch in which they scored 25 of 29 points, 13 of them in a row. It was the first time Campbell scored in double figures in a college game and the first time three Georgetown freshmen scored in double figures in the same game since January 18, 2005, when Jeff Green, Roy Hibbert, and Jonathan Wallace had each scored 12 in a loss at Syracuse. By the time the Hoyas hosted Marquette, they had fallen back out of the Top 25 thanks to the loss at Xavier, but they overcame their own cold shooting streak and a late surge by the Golden Eagles to win, thanks in part to 15 points by D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, a double-double (12 points and 10 rebounds) by Joshua Smith, 13 points by L. J. Peak, and 12 by Jabril Trawick.\nWith a conference record of 2–1, Georgetown went on the road to visit Providence and DePaul. They lost to Providence in overtime, with D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scoring 15 points, Joshua Smith recording another double-double with 15 points and 12 rebounds, and Paul White scoring 11 points off the bench, but recovered to beat DePaul – the team which upset them in the first round of the previous season's Big East tournament – for the 15th time in the past 16 meetings. Against the Blue Demons, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored a game-high 25 points – including six of eight free throws he attempted in the final minute, part of a 26-for-32 (81.3 percent) Georgetown performance at the free-throw line – and Jabril Trawick added 11. The Hoyas then returned home to meet Butler – which had beaten them in November during the Battle 4 Atlantis, then risen to as high as No. 15 in the AP Poll in December before falling back out of the AP Top 25 – for the first conference game of the season between the teams. Bulldog redshirt junior forward Roosevelt Jones scored a career-high 28 points, and the lead seesawed back and forth ten times in the final 8:48 of the game, but Isaac Copeland hit a three-pointer in the final seconds to give Georgetown the lead and D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera – who led the Hoyas with 14 points – preserved a Hoya victory by blocking Jones's final layup. Copeland, Joshua Smith, and Jabril Trawick scored 10 points each against the Bulldogs.\nNext to visit the Verizon Center was No. 4 Villanova, Georgetown's highest-ranked opponent since a meeting with No. 1 Indiana in November 2012. At 17–1 overall and 4–1 in the Big East, the Wildcats had won four in a row since suffering their only loss of the season in an overtime game at Seton Hall 16 days earlier. It was a physical game, with the teams combining for 50 fouls. The Hoyas forced 17 Wildcat turnovers and held Villanova to 34 percent shooting from the field; the Wildcats shot 2-for-10 from three-point range during the first half and scored only two points off fast breaks during the entire game. Georgetown, in contrast, shot 60 percent from the field in the first half and pulled away early, holding Villanova scoreless for over seven minutes during a 17–0 Hoya scoring run that built a 30–11 Georgetown lead, and Georgetown went into the locker room ahead 42–20 at halftime. The Hoyas led by as many as 26 points in the second half. Villanova junior guard Ryan Arcidiacono, who finished with 16 points, hit three three-pointers that helped the Wildcats close to 62–50 with eight minutes to play while Jabril Trawick sat on the bench for several minutes after getting hit in the eye, but Georgetown then went on a 6–0 run to open up a 68–50 lead. Villanova junior forward Daniel Ochefu, coming off a career-high 21 points against Pennsylvania two days earlier, scored only four points before fouling out with 4:13 remaining in the game. The Hoyas shot 51 percent from the field for the game and won 78–58. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, who had been announced as Big East Player of the Week earlier in the day, and Isaac Copeland each had 17 points – a career high for Copeland – to lead all scorers, while Jabril Trawick added 10 points and Joshua Smith had nine points and eight rebounds. Georgetown's 20-point upset put the Hoyas in first place in the Big East at 4–1, a half-game ahead of 4–2 Villanova, and the Georgetown student section stormed the court in celebration. The Hoyas stretched their winning streak to four games five days later with an overtime victory at Marquette, featuring a balanced attack in which D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 19 points including five three-pointers, Joshua Smith recorded another double-double with 18 points and 15 rebounds, Isaac Copeland scored 17 points, and Mikael Hopkins added 13, while Tre Campbell and Aaron Bowen both came off the bench to score in double figures, Campbell finishing with 14 points and Bowen with 11.\nGeorgetown returned to the AP Top 25 after a three-week absence, ranked No. 21 in time for a return to the Verizon Center and the second meeting with Xavier of the season. L. J. Peak, who had injured his left ankle in the Marquette game, sat out the first five minutes, allowing Isaac Copeland to make his first collegiate start. D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored 13 points, Peak had 12, and Joshua Smith contributed 10, but the Hoyas shot only 39 percent from the field and committed a season-high 17 turnovers, six of them by Jabril Trawick, who started despite suffering a bruised right thigh against Marquette. Xavier held Georgetown without a field goal for more than 11 minutes in the first half, and Georgetown's 16 points in the half were its fewest first-half points since it scored 16 in the first half of a game against Tennessee in November 2012. Georgetown had another scoring drought of over three minutes in the second half, and Xavier held Georgetown to only 53 points for the game, tying the Hoyas′ season low set in the game at Xavier on January 3. The Musketeers won 66–53, sweeping the season series with Georgetown and snapping their own road losing streak of five games dating back to the previous season – Xavier's longest road losing streak since an eight-game skid across two seasons in 1987. Georgetown's winning streak ended at four, dropping the Hoyas into second place in the Big East at 6–3, albeit only percentage points behind Villanova and Providence, both 5–2 on the season. However, the Hoyas bounced back to close out January with a dominating win against last-place Creighton in which no Creighton player scored in double figures and at one point the Bluejays went scoreless for 17 minutes 18 seconds. Georgetown held the Bluejays to 40 points and 20.8 percent shooting from the field, the lowest shooting percentage by a Big East team since Marquette shot 18.9 percent against Ohio State on November 16, 2013, and the lowest in a Big East game since West Virginia shot 20 percent against Cincinnati in the original Big East on January 30, 2008.\nDropping to No. 24 in the AP Poll, the Hoyas began February by suffering a loss at home to Providence, which used a 20-6 run in the second half – with Georgetown going without a field goal for the final 7:41 of the game – to fuel a come-from-behind win that broke a 31-road-game Providence losing streak against ranked teams and a seven-game Hoya winning streak at home against the Friars. The Friars completed a season sweep of the Hoyas despite 21 points by D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, 10 by Joshua Smith, and Tre Campbell and Isaac Copeland coming off the bench to score 10 each. The Hoyas then traveled to Philadelphia for a rematch with Villanova, now ranked No. 7 and sporting a 21–2 record overall and 8–2 in the Big East, before a large crowd at the Wells Fargo Center. The Wildcats wore 1985 throwback uniforms in celebration of Villanova's upset triumph 30 years earlier over the 1984–1985 Hoyas in the 1985 NCAA tournament′s national championship game. Villanova pulled out to an early 17-point lead and led by as many as 24 points on 12-for-24 three-point shooting, a 50 percent performance well above the 36 percent they had shot from beyond the arc entering the game. In contrast, Georgetown's two leading scorers – D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera with 15.8 and Joshua Smith with 11.9 points per game – managed only a combined nine points on 4-for-11 (36.4 percent) shooting, and the Hoyas as a team shot only 1-for-17 (5.9 percent) from three-point range and 30 percent from the field overall. The Hoyas trailed 37-24 at the half and never mounted a comeback, ultimately losing 69–53, tying their lowest point total of the season with the 53 points they scored in each of the Xavier games. L. J. Peak with 15 points and Aaron Bowen with 10 off the bench were the only Hoyas to score in double figures.\nLosers of three out of four, the Hoyas fell back out of the Top 25, but they promptly embarked on a three-game winning streak with victories at Seton Hall and at home against St. John's and DePaul to improve to 18–8 on the season and 10–5 in the conference. At Seton Hall, the Hoyas jumped out to a 27–7 lead before the Pirates came back to tie the game at 44–44, but Georgetown then built a lead again to win 86–67; D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera scored a game-high 23 points and Isaac Copeland had two career highs with 20 points and eight rebounds, while Jabril Trawick added 12 points. Hosting St. John's a week later, Copeland had a double-double with 12 points and a new career high of 10 rebounds, while Smith-Rivera, Joshua Smith, and L. J. Peak also each scored 12, Trawick added 11, and Mikael Hopkins came off the bench also to score 12. The win over DePaul four days later – the Hoyas′ 16th victory over the Blue Demons in the past 17 meetings – gave Georgetown sole possession of second place in the Big East, with Smith-Rivera leading all scorers in the game with 19 points, Joshua Smith recording another double-double (15 points and 10 rebounds), Copeland scoring 12, and Trawick adding 10. Traveling to Madison Square Garden for a rematch with St. John's on the last day of February, however, the Hoyas stumbled, losing to the Red Storm despite Smith-Rivera's 29 points and a double-double (10 points, 12 rebounds) and three steals by Mikael Hopkins.\nGeorgetown next visited No. 21 Butler for their second conference meeting and third meeting overall of the season. The Bulldogs forced 15 turnovers and outrebounded the Hoyas 39–20, including 17–2 on the offensive end, and outscored Georgetown 15–2 in second-chance points, but the underdog Hoyas blocked ten shots and held the Bulldogs to 35.3 percent shooting from the field. Butler also failed to take full advantage of free-throw opportunities, going 10-for-22 (45.5 percent) from the line. Butler's top-scoring player, junior guard Kellen Dunham, went scoreless for the first minutes and for the final minutes and finished with only eight points. The Hoyas led 30–24 at halftime and 34–24 early in the second half, but Butler came back to take a 40–39 lead with 11:35 remaining. Georgetown responded with five straight points to take a 44–40 lead with 8:56 to play. The Hoyas never trailed again, but had to fend off a Butler bid to tie or take the lead in the final seconds with heroics by D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera. With Georgetown clinging to a 56–54 lead, Joshua Smith missed a free throw with 10.2 seconds remaining and Bulldog senior forward Kameron Woods grabbed the rebound, but Smith-Rivera stole the ball from Woods and drew a foul by Butler sophomore forward Andrew Chrabascz. Smith-Rivera made both free throws to extend the lead to 58–54, then stole an inbounds pass by redshirt junior forward Austin Etherington with five seconds left, drew a foul by Bulldog redshirt junior forward Roosevelt Jones, and made two more free throws with four seconds left to seal a 60–54 Georgetown upset win. Smith Rivera scored 16 points before a home-town crowd in his native Indianapolis, while Joshua Smith contributed 10 and Tre Campbell added 10 off the bench.\nGeorgetown completed the regular season by hosting Seton Hall at the Verizon Center. Sidelined by heart arrhythmia since early in his freshman season in 2011, Georgetown senior center Tyler Adams had been relegated to the bench ever since under a medical hardship waiver that allowed him to remain on scholarship without counting against the school's scholarship total as long as he did not play, but he had been a steady presence and \"de facto\" assistant coach on the sidelines. In a process begun 16 months earlier, John Thompson III arranged for an NCAA waiver that allowed Adams to make a one-possession appearance against Seton Hall on Senior Day, the last home game before his graduation, something Thompson did not announce to Adams or anyone else on the team until two days before the game. Adams started the game and Seton Hall allowed him to make an uncontested dunk almost immediately, giving Georgetown a 2–0 lead, to an ovation by the Verizon Center crowd; it was an emotional moment for both Adams and his teammates. Thompson immediately called a timeout and Adams exited the game, but Georgetown played on to defeat the Pirates, sweeping the season series with them. Leading Georgetown scorer D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera sat out the game with a lower body injury – the only game he missed all season – but Jabril Trawick scored 19 points and Tre Campbell 13. The Hoyas finished the regular season with a record of 20–6 overall and 12-6 in the Big East, tied for second place with Butler.\nBig East tournament.\nGeorgetown rose into the AP Top 25 again, ranked No. 23 before the 2015 Big East tournament began at Madison Square Garden. Under tie-breaking criteria, the Big East Conference considered Georgetown to have finished in second place in the regular season, and so the Hoyas received the No. 2 seed in the tournament, giving them a bye in the first round. They began play in the quarterfinals, facing No. 10 seed Creighton, which had upset seventh-seeded DePaul in the first round to advance to meet Georgetown. The Hoyas led 31–25 at halftime, but the Bluejays came back in the second half despite the loss of senior guard Avery Dingman, who went to the locker room after suffering an injury in a collision with eight minutes left to play, and Creighton led 51–45 with about six minutes to play. With five minutes left to play, however, D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera took control of the game, scoring 12 of Georgetown's final 14 points with a three-pointer, a three-point play, a driving two-point shot as he fell down, and four free throws, the last of which he sank with 3.2 seconds remaining. The Bluejays, meanwhile, committed three of their 18 turnovers during the game's final 2:15. Georgetown won 60–55, completing a three-game sweep of Creighton for the season. Georgetown's front court had an off game – L. J. Peak scored only three points and Isaac Copeland only two, and both were scoreless in the first half –but D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera finished with 25 points and Joshua Smith with 10. Georgetown had 11 steals, three of them by Jabril Trawick, and although Creighton outrebounded Georgetown 31–28, the Hoyas had a big advantage at the free-throw line, going 20-for-26 (76.9 percent) while Creighton went 6-for-8 (75 percent).\nGeorgetown advanced to the Big East tournament semifinals for the first time since 2013 to face sixth-seeded Xavier, which had upset the tournament's third seed, No. 22 Butler, the previous day to advance. Xavier took a 36–26 lead at halftime, and extended its lead to 20 points with 7:53 left in the game. Georgetown then went on a 15–1 scoring run, with Isaac Copeland contributing 11 points in a little over four minutes during the rally, while the Musketeers, who led the Big East in free-throw shooting percentage, went 1-for-7 (14.3 percent) from the line. Xavier freshman forward Trevon Bluiett finally brought the Georgetown run to an end with a three-pointer that gave the Musketeers a 57–48 lead with 3:38 left to play. Georgetown continued to close the gap, however, and with 14.7 seconds remaining, Xavier's lead had diminished to 60–59. Then the Musketeers began making free throws again, sinking four in a row and extending their lead to 64–61 with 4.6 seconds remaining. With 1.9 seconds left to play, Jabril Trawick came to the free throw line for two shots; he intended to make the first one – which he did, reducing Xavier's lead to 64-62 – and then deliberately miss the second one to give his team a chance at a rebound and a tying or winning field goal. But Trawick accidentally made his second shot as well, reducing Xavier's lead to 64–63 but giving Xavier possession of the ball. The Hoyas fouled Xavier junior forward James Farr immediately; Farr made his first free throw at the other end and missed the second, but Paul White grabbed the rebound too late even for one last desperate heave down the court before time expired. Making five of its last six free throws in the game's final 10.6 seconds, Xavier upset Georgetown 65–63, completing a three-game season sweep of the Hoyas and advancing to face Villanova in the tournament championship game the following evening.\nNCAA tournament.\nWith a record of 21–10 and climbing to No. 22 in the AP Poll, Georgetown received a bid to the 2015 NCAA tournament, its 30th appearance in the tournament, eighth appearance in the past ten seasons, and first since 2013. Seeded No. 4 in the South Region, the Hoyas opened play in the Round of 64 (known as the \"Second Round\" that season), by meeting the region's No. 13 seed, Eastern Washington of the Big Sky Conference, at the Moda Center in Portland, Oregon. The Hoyas had lost four of the last five NCAA tournament games they had played, all of them to teams seeded 10th or lower; Eastern Washington entered the game averaging 80.8 points per game and had the leading Division I scorer in the United States in redshirt junior guard Tyler Harvey, who was averaging 22.9 points per game. During an interview on a national radio show the day before the game, Eastern Washington head coach Jim Hayford extolled the virtues of his team and promised that the Eagles, who were making only the second NCAA tournament appearance in school history and first since 2004, would beat the Hoyas in an upset. Joshua Smith got into early foul trouble and spent long stretches on the bench while the Eagles spread the floor and played a fast game, attempting a barrage of three-pointers; they made six of their first 12 three-point attempts, and they hit three of them in a row to take a 24–17 lead midway through the first half, raising fears on the Georgetown team that they were destined to lose in another NCAA tournament first-round upset at the hands of a double-digit seed. But with both Smith and Mikael Hopkins on the bench with foul trouble, Thompson turned to unheralded junior reserve center Bradley Hayes, who had spent three seasons in obscurity on the bench. Hayes responded to the opportunity with the breakout game of his career, playing the final 10 minutes of the first half; he scored a career-high eight points, making all three lay-ups and both free throws he attempted, pulled down a career-high six rebounds, and recorded an assist. He did not play after halftime, but in no small part thanks to his efforts, as well as to the Hoyas sinking their share of three-pointers, Georgetown pulled out to a 43–33 lead at the half. Hayes's ten minutes of play turned out to be the turning point of the game. Georgetown opened the second half with a 15–2 scoring run that culminated in back-to-back three-pointers by D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, stretching the Hoyas′ lead to 58–35. The Eagles closed to a seven-point deficit in the final seconds, but finally succumbed despite Harvey's game-high 27 points. Georgetown won 84–74, its first NCAA tournament victory since 2012, shooting 11-for-23 (47.8 percent) from three-point range for the game, while Eastern Washington shot 9-for-28 (32.1 percent) in three-pointers. Smith-Rivera had 25 points and Mikael Hopkins scored 10 and had nine rebounds, while Jabril Trawick and Paul White also contributed 10 points each. Eastern Washington exited with an all-time NCAA tournament record of 0–2.\nThe Hoyas advanced to the Round of 32 (termed the \"Third Round\" this season) for the first time since 2012 to face the South Region's fifth seed, No. 19 Utah, which had defeated 12th-seeded Stephen F. Austin to advance to meet Georgetown. The game was a contrast between Georgetown's \"Princeton offense\" and Utah's motion offense, and the Utes had initial trouble with the Hoyas, who used perimeter shooting to build an 11-point lead early in the first half. However, Utah battled back to tie the game at 32–32 at halftime and had a 57–53 lead late in the second half. The Hoyas kept the game close, and L. J. Peak scored on a layup to hold Utah's lead to 61–57 with 3:06 left. After that, however, Utah scored on a three-pointer and a layup to take a decisive 66-59 lead with 1:40 remaining and the Utes went on to upset the Hoyas 75–64, bringing Georgetown's season to a close. Peak led the Hoyas with 18 points, Isaac Copeland had 14, D'Vantes Smith-Rivera contributed 12, and Jabril Trawick – playing his final game as a Hoya – scored 10. For the sixth straight time since their Final Four appearance in 2007, the Hoyas exited the NCAA tournament in its first weekend due to an upset by a lower-seeded opponent. They again dropped out of the Top 25 in the final national rankings for the season.\nWrap-up.\nD'Vauntes Smith-Rivera was the team's leading scorer for the season; he missed one game late in the season due to injury but started the other 32, shooting 42.1 percent from the field overall and 38.7 percent in three-pointers, averaging 16.3 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. Joshua Smith played in all 33 games, starting all but one of them, and averaged 10.8 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, shooting 62.1 percent from the field. Jabril Trawick started all 33 games, shooting 49.2 percent in field-goal attempts and 40.7 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 9.1 points and 3.6 rebounds per game. Playing in all 33 games and starting 32 of them, L. J. Peak averaged 7.9 points per game on 39.4 percent field-goal shooting and had 2.3 rebounds per game. Isaac Copeland, Mikael Hopkins, Tre Campbell, Aaron Bowen, and Paul White also played in every game. Copeland had 11 starts and finished with 6.8 points per game on 45.1 percent shooting from the field and had 3.8 rebounds per game, Hopkins stated 24 times, shot 43.8 percent, and averaged 5.1 points and 5.8 rebounds, and Campbell had one start and finished with 3.8 points per game. Bowen and White came off the bench in every game, Bowen shooting 52.9 percent from the field and finishing with 5.6 points and 2.0 rebounds per game and White averaging 5.0 points on 40.4 percent shooting and grabbing 2.8 rebounds per game. Reggie Cameron played in 23 games, all as a reserve, and averaged 1.2 points on 27.6 percent shooting.\nJoshua Smith, Jabril Trawick, Mikael Hopkins, Aaron Bowen, and Tyler Adams all graduated after the season. Smith completed his abbreviated Georgetown career of one-and-a-half seasons having played in 46 games, starting all but one, shooting 63.1 percent from the field and averaging 11.0 points and 5.1 rebounds per game; he went undrafted in the 2015 National Basketball Association draft and then played professionally in the NBA Development League and overseas. Trawick had 74 starts in his 126 games, and he shot 46.6 percent from the field for his career, averaging 6.8 points and 2.7 rebounds per game. Over his five seasons at Georgetown – his seven-game freshman season cut short by surgery – Bowen played in 111 games and made one start, and he finished with a 48.3 percent field-goal percentage and 4.1 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. Hopkins had played in 128 games in his four years at Georgetown, starting 75 of them, shooting 42.3 percent from the field and averaging 4.9 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Adams, sidelined for virtually his entire college career by his heart ailment, had made his real contribution through his support to the team during his four seasons on the bench. He graduated with only 24 minutes played in only five collegiate appearances, four of them early in his freshman season and one – his only start – on Senior Day of his senior year. He finished his college career with a total of 12 points – scored on 5-for-10 shooting from the field (one of his field goals being his uncontested senior-year dunk on Senior Day in 2015) and 2-for-2 free-throw shooting – and nine rebounds.\nGeorgetown announced on March 31, 2015, that D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera had decided to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2015 National Basketball Association draft, a sudden move that surprised observers, who had not ranked him highly as a National Basketball Association prospect. His decision to depart left the Hoyas facing a rebuilding year the following season. He did not hire an agent and, with his final year of college eligibility therefore intact, he decided a week later to withdraw his name from the draft pool and return to Georgetown for his senior year, causing expectations for the following year's team to soar. Speaking publicly about his decision for the first time on April 30, 2015, Smith-Rivera explained that he initially had decided to enter the NBA draft out of an abundance of confidence in himself and comfort with his abilities as a player, but that his parents had convinced him that returning to Georgetown and completing his education was a wiser choice for the following season.\nWith Joshua Smith back at center and playing the entire season, the 2014-15 Hoyas enjoyed success, finishing 22–11 overall and in second place in the Big East Conference, achieving a national ranking – No. 22 in the postseason AP Poll and No. 24 in the postseason Coaches Poll, although they dropped out of the Top 25 in both in the final polls of the season – and returning to the NCAA tournament after a one-year absence. However, the Hoyas' frustrations in the tournament continued, as they again exited early; in the eight seasons since the Final Four season of 2006-07, Georgetown had made six NCAA tournament appearances without ever advancing past the first weekend, and had gone 3–6 in tournament games, each time losing to a lower-seeded opponent. Despite this disappointment, 2014-15 was significant as the last winning season and the last season to include a postseason tournament appearance during John Thompson III's tenure at Georgetown. Although it was not apparent at the time, the Georgetown men's basketball program was about to slide into mediocrity. Over the next two seasons, Thompson would round out his Georgetown career with two straight losing records and no postseason bids – a trend that would continue after his departure into the first season under his successor, Patrick Ewing.\nRoster.\nWhen he joined the team this season, freshman forward Trey Mourning, the son of Alonzo Mourning, became only the fourth son of a former player to play for Georgetown, joining Riyan Williams, the son of Reggie Williams, who made the team as a walk-on for the second straight season. Other than Mourning and Williams, only two sons of former players had played at Georgetown: Patrick Ewing Jr., the son of Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown during the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 seasons, and Ed Hargaden Jr., who played during the 1957-58, 1958-59, and 1959-60 seasons and was the son of Ed Hargaden, Georgetown's first All-American and star of the 1932-33, 1933-34, and 1934-35 teams.\nRankings.\nSource\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:white;\"| Big East Conference Play\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:white;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#002147; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament\nSource"

        "text": "Kevin Thomas (born 8 May 1980, in Swansea) is a professional Welsh darts player who competes in Professional Darts Corporation events. He uses the nickname The Undertaker for his matches due to him being of fan of WWE's Undertaker.\nBDO career.\nKevin Thomas has been playing darts from the early age of 6, but started out properly as a 15 year old Glamorgan Youth Player in 1995. He got picked for The Wales Youth Team in 1995,1996 and 1997 and throughout his Youth years, he was a dominant force in Youth darts winning the Southern Inter Counties Under 18 Youth Averages 2 times and the Under 21 Averages 2 times. In 1999, Thomas reached the final of the British Teenage Open where he lost 3–1 against Matt Chapman. He competed consistently in BDO County Men's 'A' games for Glamorgan and played for Wales Men 28 times with 15 wins from those appearances. He also competed in BDO tournament events in the coming years with his best success reaching the last 24 televised stage of The 2011 Winmau World Masters where he lost out to Steve Douglas 2–0. He also represented Wales in the 4 man Wales World Cup Squad in The Republic of Ireland in 2011 where he lost in the last 64 of the Men's Singles to Finland's Jarkko Komula.\nPDC career.\nAfter a brief spell in the mid 2000s in the early days of the PDC which involved going around different Greene King pubs to qualify for events, Thomas rejoined the 'reformed' PDC in 2013 and hit his first competitive nine-dart finish whilst playing in the second UK Open Qualifier against Peter Hudson. He qualified for the UK Open in Bolton for the first time at the first time of asking through the UK Open Order Of Merit and lost out to Conan Whitehead in the second round. Thomas' best result of his career to date came at the 2014 Dutch Darts Masters where he beat Wayne Jones 6–1 and Steve Beaton 6–5, before he lost 6–4 to Mervyn King in the last 16 earning £2,000 in the process. Thomas matched this run at the sixth Players Championship of the year by beating Peter Hudson, Andy Hamilton and Ronnie Baxter, but was then eliminated 6–4 by Kyle Anderson.\nAnother last 16 defeat came in 2015 at the second Players Championship event, 6–5 at the hands of James Wade, but Thomas went one better at the fourth event by reaching his first PDC quarter-final. He came through a trio of deciding leg games against Magnus Caris, Andy Smith and Andy Boulton and beat Andy Hamilton 6–3, before losing 6–1 to world number one Michael van Gerwen.\nHis best result of 2016 came at the Dutch Darts Masters, where he beat Jan Dekker 6–3, before losing by a reversal of this scoreline to Dave Chisnall in the second round picking up £1,500 in the process. Other than that he reached the last 64 in three more events during the year. Thomas still competes regularly on the PDC circuit and currently holds the record for the most wins in Q School whilst not officially owning a full PDC tour card. Thomas still regularly enters the Q School, Pro Tour and Euro Tour events (OOM circumstances permitting) but due to a lack of serious sponsorship in recent years, he hasn't entered so many. At the moment, Thomas is currently an associate member of the PDC which means he is a regular on The PDC Challenge Tour and his aim is to get as high up in these ranking events to secure a full time PDC Pro Tour Card to enter more professional PDC events in the future and to get back to where he knows he deserves to be playing. Aside from that, Thomas still plays his local darts in his home town of Swansea where he has been dominating the Super Leagues and Local Leagues he plays in for many years. Thomas is also a multiple time tournament winner and has won countless local and Welsh Ranking Tournaments around the Welsh valleys. Thomas recently starred in the Welsh Darts Program Oci Oci Oci which aired on S4C on 22 June 2019."

        "text": "Jack Dougherty (born May 25, 1996) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for the Nürnberg Ice Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). Dougherty was selected by the Nashville Predators in the second round (51st overall) of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nDougherty was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, but grew up in Cottage Grove, Minnesota. He was rated as a top prospect who was projected as a possible first round selection in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. He trained with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program team during the 2013–14 season, and was invited to participate in the 2013 CCM/USA Hockey All-American Prospects Game. In October 2013 he committed to play for the Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team of the NCAA Big Ten Conference.\nOn July 24, 2015, Dougherty signed a three-year entry level contract with the Predators. As a result, Dougherty was sent to the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, the team which held his major junior rights.\nPrior to the 2018–19 season, on October 1, 2018, Dougherty was traded by the Predators to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Nicholas Baptiste. With the Sabres' AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans, he compiled 2 goals and 10 assists for 12 points in 56 games from the blueline.\nFollowing the conclusion of his entry-level deal with the Sabres, on June 25, 2019, Dougherty was not tendered a qualifying offer by Buffalo, releasing him to free agency. On July 10, 2019, Dougherty agreed to a one-year AHL contract with the Belleville Senators, affiliate to the Ottawa Senators, on July 10, 2019.\nHaving left the Senators organization as a free agent, Dougherty was signed to a one-year AHL contract with the Providence Bruins on September 30, 2021, and was invited to the Boston Bruins training camp on a professional try-out. He appeared in just one game with Providence to start the 2020–21 season, before he was later returned in a trade for future considerations to former club, the Belleville Senators, on November 23, 2021.\nUnable to secure an AHL contract for the 2022–23 season, Dougherty was signed as a free agent to a contract with the Orlando Solar Bears of the ECHL on October 12, 2022. Following 19 games with the Bears, Dougherty returned to the Belleville Senators in the AHL, making 15 further regular season appearances.\nOn February 16, 2023, having left the AHL, Dougherty was immediately signed for the remainder of the 2022–23 season, by German club Kölner Haie of the DEL. He made just two appearances during his tenure with the Sharks going scoreless.\nAs a free agent, Dougherty opted to continue in the DEL, signing a one-year contract with the Nürnberg Ice Tigers on July 26, 2023. \nInternational play.\nAs a 16-year-old he was named to the USA U17 Select team to play in the 2012 Five Nations Cup tournament held in the Czech Republic in August 2012.\nAs a 17-year-old, Dougherty was chosen to compete with the American U-18 squad at the 2013 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament where he won a silver medal, and he also helped Team USA capture the gold medal at the 2014 IIHF World U18 Championships."

        "text": "Anthony Hewitt (born April 27, 1989) is a professional baseball player who is a free agent. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft and spent seven seasons in the Phillies' minor league system, never reaching higher than Class Double-A baseball.\nEarly life.\nHewitt was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended public school there before transferring to the Salisbury School, a preparatory academy in Connecticut. Early in his life, Hewitt played basketball, but soon realized that his physique was most conducive to baseball and switched his emphasis to this sport. He was a New York Yankees fan, and \"idolized\" Alex Rodriguez. In high school, he played shortstop and was a strong hitter, the latter of which was the primary reason the Phillies drafted him in the first round of the 2008 MLB Draft.\nProfessional career.\nWhen the Phillies drafted Hewitt, he signed a contract that included a signing bonus, as well as money to pay for eight semesters at Vanderbilt University, which Hewitt planned to attend in the offseason as a business or economics major in the hopes of learning how to manage his money. Hewitt began his career with the GCL Phillies, the rookie affiliate of the Phillies organization, with whom he posted a .197 batting average with one home run and nine runs batted in (RBIs). The next year, as a member of the Williamsport Crosscutters, Hewitt marginally improved his performance at the plate, hitting .223 with seven home runs and 30 RBIs. During his first two seasons, he played third base and outfield; ultimately, the Phillies made him an outfielder. His next two years were with the Lakewood BlueClaws; in 2010, he had a \"miserable\" season, compiling a .202 batting average, barely above the \"Mendoza Line\".\nHe understood the \"high stakes\" of his 2011 season, and he bounced back somewhat, totaling 14 home runs and 36 stolen bases to supplant his .240 batting average (both of which were professional career highs). Over the first few months of the season, he even had what one writer termed a \"breakout\" year before a mediocre second half of the season. In 2012, he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers, of Class A-Advanced, with whom he posted a .241 batting average, 13 home runs, 50 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. He was promoted once again in 2013, joining a fellow first-round pick, Jesse Biddle, with the Double-A Reading Fightin' Phils. He seemed to be on an upward spiral, finally realizing his potential; he noted that he no longer sought to live up to others' expectations, and sought to live up only to his own, which helped him relax and play with confidence, according to manager Dusty Wathan, who also praised Hewitt's incessant strong work ethic. Concurrently, Hewitt once again improved his batting average (albeit minimally, going from .241 in 2012 to .244 in 2013), and hit a career-high 16 home runs. However, the 2014 season was his last in the Phillies' organization. After a \"dismal\" start to the season in Reading, he was demoted to Clearwater, from which the Phillies released him on June 12, 2014 after \"failing to develop in seven disappointing seasons\". Corey Seidman, a writer for Comcast SportsNet, summarized Hewitt's career with the Phillies as follows: \nFollowing his release by the Phillies, Hewitt signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles but only played 13 games for the Orioles High-A affiliate the Frederick Keys. On March 24, 2016, Hewitt signed with the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, joining fellow former Phillies first round pick Greg Golson."

The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side. As a lightweight rowing competition, the body mass of the rowers was limited to a maximum of 72.5 kilograms each and 70 kilograms on average.\nThe competition consisted of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals.\nWith 19 boats in heats, the best boats qualify directly for the semi-finals. All other boats progress to the repechage round, which offers a second chance to qualify for the semi-finals. Unsuccessful boats from the repechage must proceed to final C, which determines places 13-18. The best three boats in each of the two semi-finals qualify for final A, which determines places 1–6 (including the medals).

        "text": "Rugby union in New South Wales is one of the leading professional and recreational team sports. Rugby football began to be played in Sydney’s schools in the early 1860s. In the more than 150 years since, the game in New South Wales has grown to include more than 100,000 participants and the Rugby World Cup Final has been hosted in Sydney.\nHistory.\nReports of folk football being played in the Colony of New South Wales date from at least as early as 1829. Games were occasional and included matches played by soldiers at Sydney's barracks or against the crews of visiting ships. The rules were variable and negotiated by the players before each game.\nRugby beginnings.\nFootball played under versions of the Rugby School rules was brought to Australia by Old Boys of the English public schools. Some settlers would have been familiar with earlier forms of the game even before it was formally codified at Rugby School in 1845. The Rugby code was introduced to schools in Sydney from the early 1860s. Players familiar with the game from the Sydney schools, along with increased arrivals from England and elsewhere, soon led to organised club football commencing in Sydney. Rugby games were being played at Sydney University in the 1860s.\nThe first ‘inter-club’ rugby match took place during July 1865 between the Sydney Football Club and a team from the Australian Cricket Club. The game was intended to be played over three Saturdays but the newspapers of the time only report on the first two. The game was postponed after the second Saturday when the Sydney FC held a lead of two goals to one, but no record has been found of the final result. Newington College is credited with having a rugby club as early as 1869. From 1872 onwards there was a rapid growth in the formation of rugby football clubs.\nAt a meeting of Sydney clubs on 22 June 1874, the Southern Rugby Football Union was formed as the governing body for rugby in New South Wales, and it was later renamed the New South Wales Rugby Union in 1892.\nNew South Wales state team.\nThe New South Wales Waratahs team is the representative team of the NSWRU. The Waratahs have competed in the transnational Super Rugby competition since the start of the professional era of rugby in 1996.\nCompetitions.\nSuper Rugby.\nThe New South Wales Waratahs play in the Super Rugby competition against other professional teams from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina. The Waratahs team won the Super Rugby title for the first time in 2014, after having previously reached the final in 2005 and 2008.\nNational Rugby Championship.\nNew South Wales has two teams in the National Rugby Championship:\nShute Shield.\nPremiership Rugby is contested in Sydney across four senior grades and three colts competitions. Club Championship trophies are also contested on overall results. The Shute Shield is the trophy for the first grade premiership competition, and the eleven clubs currently competing for the premiership are:\nOver the many years of competition for the NSW premiership, a number of formerly notable clubs became defunct. Some of the early ones include: Glebe (Australian Club Champions in 1908), Pirates, The Sydney Football Club (est. 1865), and Wallaroos. \nThe Tooheys New Cup, which was the other recent first grade competition, ran from 2002 to 2006. An abbreviated Shute Shield competition was played in the latter part of the season during those years. When the Tooheys New Cup competition was disbanded, the Shute Shield competition was expanded again for the 2007 season.\nSuburban rugby.\nBelow the NSWRU grade competition is the New South Wales Suburban Rugby Union (commonly known as Subbies). With over 6,000 players and 55 clubs this is believed to be the largest centrally organised rugby union competition in the world.\nCountry Rugby.\nThe New South Wales Country Rugby Union is affiliated with the NSWRU and administers game in the majority of non-metropolitan areas of NSW. The union is split into nine zones with 100 clubs and over 16,000 players. NSW Country is represented by the New South Wales Country Cockatoos team.\nWomen's Rugby.\nClub competitions for women's 15-a-side teams are run in Sydney and Newcastle. A representative team from Sydney is regularly selected to play the NSW Country Corellas and the Australian Army women's team. The NSWRU also sends women's 15-a-side and 7-a-side representative teams to the ARU National Championships each year. The six clubs in the Sydney women's competition, as of 2014, are:\nSchoolboy Rugby.\nThe Waratah Shield is a rugby union knock-out competition for high school teams from New South Wales, Australia. First contested in 1963, it is organised by New South Wales Rugby Union in conjunction with NSW Schools' Rugby Union and NSW Combined High Schools and attracts around 100 entries each year.\nTaki Toa Shield.\nThe Taki Toa Shield is a rugby union tournament played among semi-professional clubs and an invitational New Zealand Māori community team in Sydney which started in 1983."

        "title": "Women's British Basketball League",
        "text": "The Women's British Basketball League (WBBL) is the top-level women's basketball league in Great Britain, founded on 5 June 2014 as the women's counterpart to the British Basketball League (BBL). The league's headquarters are in Leicester alongside the offices of the men's BBL.\nLike the BBL, the organisation uses a franchise-based system so there is no promotion and relegation between the WBBL and the English Women's Basketball League, which forms the lower divisions. Along with the WBBL Championship and the post-season Play-offs, it also runs two knockout competitions featuring all WBBL member teams - the WBBL Cup and WBBL Trophy.\nHistory.\nOfficially approved by the British Basketball League and England Basketball, the newly created Women's British Basketball League was announced to the public on 5 June 2014, and the 2014–15 season was the league's first full season of competition.\nThe initial line-up included pre-existing teams from England and Wales, competing in a franchise-based organisation similar to the men's British Basketball League model, with no promotion or relegation in operation with the lower leagues. All eight teams from the pre-existing English Basketball League Division One (Women) competition were selected as member clubs, as well as the two finalists from the 2014 Division Two (Women) Play-offs, Brixton Lady TopCats and Leeds Beckett University. Since the league's inauguration, both Leeds and Brixton have resigned from the league, but three new clubs have joined in that time, including the league's first member club from Scotland.\nCompetitions.\nWBBL Championship.\nThe WBBL Championship is the flagship competition of the Women's British Basketball League and features all member teams playing a 22-game regular season (in a round robin format), from October through to April. Matches are played according to FIBA rules and games consist of four-quarters of 10 minutes each. Two points are awarded for a win, with overtime used if the score is tied at the final buzzer – unlimited numbers of 5-minute overtime periods are played until one team is ahead when a period ends. At the end of the regular season, the team with the most points is crowned as WBBL Champions. If points are equal between two or more teams then head-to-head results between said teams are used to determine the winners. In the case of a tie between multiple teams where this does not break the tie, the winners are then determined by the points difference in the games between said teams. Following the completion of the Championship regular season, the top eight ranked teams advance into the post-season Play-offs which usually take place during April.\nWBBL Playoffs.\nThe post-season Playoffs usually takes place in April, featuring the top eight ranked teams from the WBBL Championship regular season compete in a knockout tournament. Teams are seeded depending on their final positioning in the Championship standings, so first-place faces eighth-place, second versus seventh-place, third against sixth-place and finally fourth plays the fifth-placed team. Both the Quarter-finals and the succeeding Semi-finals are played over a two-game series (home &amp; away) with the higher seed having choice of home advantage in the either the 1st or 2nd leg – an aggregated score over the two games will determine which team will advance to the next stage. As with the Quarter-finals, teams in the Semi-finals are also seeded, with the highest-ranking team drawn against the lowest-ranking team in one Semi-final and the two remaining teams drawn together in the other Semi-final. The culmination of the post-season is the grand Final, a one-off game played at the end of April, where the winners will be crowned as Play-off Champions.\nBetty Codona Trophy.\nThe WBBL Trophy, now officially the Betty Codona Trophy, is an annual pool stage and knockout tournament featuring all WBBL member clubs.\nFor the first two seasons, pairings were drawn completely at random – there were no seeds, and a draw took place after the majority of fixtures have been played in each round. A preliminary round took place between the lowest-finishing teams in the previous league season, so that the tournament proper started with eight teams in the first round.\nFrom the 2016-17 season, the format was revamped, splitting the teams into a number of geographical groups. The top teams from each group qualify for the semi-finals, which are played as straight knockout ties.\nWBBL Cup.\nThe WBBL Cup is an annual knockout competition featuring all WBBL member clubs. It is a straight knockout competition.\nBetty Codona Classic.\nThe Betty Codona Classic was an annual three-day tournament named in honour of Betty Codona OBE, a stalwart of women's basketball in Britain for over 50 years and founder of the country's first women's team, Sheffield Hatters. The competition was originally set up as an independent event for the top clubs in Women's basketball and predates the creation of the WBBL by a year, but was adopted as an official WBBL competition after the league was established.\nThe original format featured the top eight-placed WBBL teams after the first 8 games of regular season play. For the 2016/2017 edition, the competition was moved to become the opening event for the WBBL season, resulting in a two-tiered format where the Classic Cup was contested by the top four from the previous season's league, with fifth to eighth placed teams from last year's league competing for the Classic Plate.\nIndividual awards.\nThe WBBL concludes each season with a number of individual awards based on overall performance from the year. The three end-of-season awards are; MVP Award (Most Valuable Player - which proposes the player with the best performance over the year); the Young Player of the Year (the best performance of a younger player usually at the age before or during university); and Coach of the Year (the coach with the best performance over the season). The WBBL also awards MVP Awards for the Playoffs, Trophy and Cup finals. In addition, 'Team of the Year' and 'Defensive Team of the Year' places are awarded to demonstrate the best five players in the league as well as the best five defensively players of the year in the league."

        "title": "Thomas Equestrian Center",
        "text": "The Thomas Equestrian Center is a program area on the Boy Scout Camp, \"Camp Cedars,\" in Saunders County, Nebraska. The program was started by Walter Thomas in 1998 with only four horses. Today, the Thomas Equestrian Center is no longer run by Walter Thomas due to differences among the council leadership but previously was Home to a miniature horse, two miniature donkeys, two ponies, and twenty-two other horses.\nLocation.\nThe Thomas Equestrian Center is located next to the COPE tower before the main entrance to Camp Cedars and has three individual areas for horses including an 85 ft diameter arena used for basic riding, along with a 175 ft long arena that is used for jumping, advanced riding, and feeding, and lastly the horses at the Thomas Equestrian Center have the paddock where the horses can get their water, eat their hay and cool off.\nOutside Camps.\nThe Thomas Equestrian Center, unlike most program areas at Camp Cedars, hosts a variety of different camps outside of the Boy Scouts over the course of the summer. Such camps include:\nA group of 15-20 Presbyterian children take part in Camp Calvin Crest's Ranch Camp every week where they drive to the Thomas Equestrian Center mornings from 9:30am to 11:30am Mondays through Fridays to learn, ride, and get to know horses at the Thomas Equestrian Center.\nChildren and adults with physical or mental disabilities come from neighboring Camp Eagle to the Thomas Equestrian Center twice a week at 8:15am to not only groom Melvin the miniature horse and two donkeys, but they get a chance to ride in either a western or side saddle.\nChildren from Methodist Camp Fontanelle come and spend most of the day at the Thomas Equestrian Center where they get to learn about, ride, groom, and get to know the many horses and donkeys of the Thomas Equestrian Center. As of 2018 this program is no longer. \nCamps of visually impaired or blind children and adults come to the Thomas Equestrian Center to get to know horses and enjoy themselves through Equine therapyas of 2018 this camp is no longer.\nClasses.\nThe Thomas Equestrian Center has many classes it provides for scouters attending Camp Cedars. As of 2019, these classes are:\nDue to the lack of riding time in the Horsemanship Merit Badge, the Advanced Horsemanship class was create to give scouts, especially older scouts, a week full of learning the finer details of riding from riding in an English saddle, to riding bareback, and playing exciting games such as horse soccer or wild, wild west on horseback. To take this class, you must have the Horsemanship Merit Badge.\nAdvanced roping is a great class for scouts who want to work even more with their roping skills. Scouts learn to desensitize a horse to a flying rope and by the end of the week have learned to rope off horseback at both stationary targets and moving cattle-like targets. Scouts must take both Horsemanship Merit Badge as well as Basic Roping before they can take Advanced Roping.\nMost scouts who come to the Thomas Equestrian Center have only heard or read about roping but never actually roped. The Basic Roping class teaches scouts about the history of roping from Spain in the 1800s to modern day roping events. Scouts learn to tie a honda knot and parts of the lasso. Scouts enjoy learning to rope and their targets gradually increase in difficulty. Although this class only teaches stationary ground roping, scouts can later take Advanced Roping and take their roping skills to a whole new level.\nAlthough the class is intended for adults, scouts and adults alike may enroll in Basic Riding Skills. In this class, wranglers judge the experience the rider has on horseback whether it be first time or more advanced, and progress the rider through new levels of riding from bareback riding to English saddles, or even riding in faster gaits.\nOne of two Merit Badges the Thomas Equestrian Center offers, the Horsemanship Merit Badge is requirement based. Although this gives scouts a great amount of book knowledge on horses, requirements only allow for less than two minutes of riding time on horseback. However scouts do learn about horse safety, parts of a horse, breeds of horses, five horse diseases, conformation, lameness and unsoundness, hoof care, grooming, feeding, parts of a saddle and bridle, mounting and dismounting, how to ride, how to lead a horse, storing equipment, and how to saddle and bridle a horse. To take the Horsemanship Merit Badge at the Thomas Equestrian Center, you must be at least 13 years of age.\nAnother class to give riders more horseback time, Medieval Jousting was created to give scouts a once in a lifetime experience cantering down a list towards a wooden target with reins in one hand and a lance in the other. Scouts learn the medieval history of jousting, as well as the modern sport of jousting. Scouts also learn about the history of chainmail. Scouts have a chance to create and bring home their own chainmail creations.\nScouts under 13 are not technically allowed to enroll in the Horsemanship Merit Badge until they are 13 years old, however the class Jr. Equestrian was created to provide younger scouts with an opportunity to ride for a week as well as building up skills that will greatly prep and benefit them for when they do take the Horsemanship Merit Badge. Scouts learn to ride as well as playing exciting games on horseback including horse soccer.\nUnique Activities.\nScouts attending Camp Cedars can choose to enjoy unique equestrian activities.\nWITH THE EXCEPTION OF TRAIL RIDES ALL PROGRAMS ARE NO LONGER TAUGHT.\nTravois.\nScouts enrolled in the Indian Lore Merit Badge will receive the opportunity to assemble and ride a horse-pulled travois. Although a travois was originally used by Native Americans for mainly transportation of the elderly or injured, scouts [since 2014] receive the chance to ride and learn about the importance of the travois in Native American culture and tradition.\nPainting.\nScouts in the Art Merit Badge previously painted pictures of trees to meet requirements. In 2014, the Thomas Equestrian Center proposed that scouts paint a picture of a standing horse. As of 2015, scouts now paint their own pictures and names on the side of the horse. This activity is also available to other visiting camps such as Camp Calvin Crest Ranch Camp.\nOvernight.\nMonday nights, scouts who have completed the Horsemanship Merit Badge are eligible to take a 7-mile total trail ride (with wranglers walking along the whole way) to Camp Eagle's lake as the sun sets. Scouts dismount their horse and set up tarps and sleeping bags where they will sleep under the stars all night long. In the morning, scouts get back up on horses and return to the Thomas Equestrian Center where they are served breakfast and sent to their first class.\nTrail Rides.\nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are open trail rides. After signing up in the administration office, scouts, adults, and family alike can go on a 2-3 mile trail ride (with wranglers walking along the whole way) through the woods next to the Thomas Equestrian Center. These trail rides take place at 7:00pm, 7:45pm, and 8:15pm. The maximum number of riders depends on the number of available horses.\nOpen Roping.\nAs of 2014, the Thomas Equestrian Center, in effort to give all scouts a chance to rope, provides open roping Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights at 7:45pm. Attendees will be given ropes and targets and will be taught the necessary roping skills.\nHorses.\nList subject to change based on year. \nReferences.\n1. http://www.mac-bsa.org/camp_info.aspx?ID=2\n2. http://www.equestriancrew250.org/"

He starred at Henderson County Community College and East Texas State University before playing briefly with the Houston Mavericks in the American Basketball Association.\nGaines attended James Madison High School in Dallas, Texas, where he played basketball and football alongside his brother Henry. After missing out most of his senior season following a football injury that required a surgery, he signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Wichita. He never played for Wichita and later started his college career at Henderson County CC in the National Junior College Athletic Association where he was twice All-Texas Eastern Conference and once Junior College All-American. In 1966, he won the Texas Eastern Conference (TEC) while leading it in scoring with a 30.6 point average and was named to the TEC All-Conference team.\nThe following season, he signed a letter of intent with North Texas State University but later transferred to East Texas State University (now known as Texas A&amp;M Commerce) where he averaged 16.8 points and 6.2 rebounds his first season and made the All-Lone Star Conference second team. He missed a large part of the following season, but still led the team with 326 points, for an average of 25.1 points per game.\nGaines was drafted by the San Diego Rockets as the first pick in the fifteenth round of the 1968 NBA draft and by the Houston Mavericks in the 13th round of the American Basketball Association (ABA) draft. He signed with the Mavericks during the summer and appeared in the team's opening game of the 1968–69 season, scoring two points. He was waived by the Mavericks, along with Rich Dumas, a week later."

        "text": "The men's single sculls rowing competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics took place at Krylatskoye Sports Complex Canoeing and Rowing Basin, Moscow, Soviet Union. The event was held from 20 to 27 July. There were 14 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Pertti Karppinen of Finland, his second of three consecutive victories from 1976 to 1984. Karppinen was the eighth man to win multiple medals in the event. Silver went to Vasil Yakusha of the Soviet Union, the nation's sixth medal in eight Games. East Germany took a third consecutive bronze medal, all by different rowers as Peter Kersten was the nation's men's single sculler this Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo of the 15 single scullers from the 1976 Games returned: gold medalist Pertti Karppinen of Finland and ninth-place finisher Hans Svensson of Sweden. Karppinen (also the reigning World Champion) was favoured to repeat, especially with his biggest rival (Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany, who had finished second to Karppinen in 1976 and would take two more silver medals in the event in 1984 and 1988) absent due to the American-led boycott. The only rower present with a major international victory was Hugh Matheson of Great Britain, the 1979 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner.\nFor the second consecutive Games, no nations made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 15th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used since 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe three fastest rowers in each heat advanced to the semifinals. The remaining rowers competed in the repechage for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe three fastest rowers in the repechage advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe three fastest rowers in each semifinal advanced to Final A, while the others went to Final B."

Due to its winning streak and sponsorship from Sonatrach, GS Pétroliers was the only club not to struggle with financial issues in the early 2010s. The 2019–20 and 2020–21 season were then cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nOn 30 November 2019, GS Pétroliers qualified for the 2020 season of the Basketball Africa League (BAL), by winning the West Division of the qualifying tournaments. The season was later rescheduled to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group stage, GSP lost its three game and could not qualify for the playoffs.\nFrom 2008 to 2020, the team was known as GS Pétroliers as it was part of the multi-sports club with that name.\nThe team's name changed back to MC Alger in 2020.\nHonours.\nNational.\nSuper Division\nAlgerian Cup\nInternational.\nArab Championship"

During this segment, McGregor claims that the games hope to \"team up\" with the viewers and would announce further details later in the show. The ceremony then continues with a countdown, starting from 14 seconds, with \"The Mother We Share\" by Chvrches playing, featuring arial shots of Glasgow, including the River Clyde and Clyde Arc.\nWelcome to Scotland.\nThe ceremony show begins with a camera zooming in on Scottish comedian Karen Dunbar who is sitting in the audience of Celtic Park. Dunbar stands up and begins to sing in a cappella accompanied by backing dancers, singing a song entitled \"Welcome to Scotland\". Dunbar is then joined by John Barrowman who emerges from behind a kilt in a car who transports him around the stadium on a tour around Scotland that has been created within the stadium, taking viewers through areas such as Ayrshire, where they focus on the works of Robert Burns, Gretna Green, significant as a place of marriage as the age of marriage in Scotland was lower than that elsewhere in the British Isles. The ceremony then focuses on the works of the River Clyde shipbuilding industry and the various ships constructed in Glasgow on the River Clyde during its peak of production.\nThe Highlands are represented through a rendition of \"Loch Lomond\" by Scottish band Runrig. Scottish culture is showcased through a variety of people dancing in costumes styled as Tunnock tea cakes, followed by a makeshift Loch Ness Monster being celebrated as a showcase of Scottish tourism and heraldry. Highland Cow, Highland pony and Dolly the Sheep are mentioned as a further showcase of Scottish culture and wildlife.\nThe ceremony recognises Scotland as the home of golf with a showcase focusing on St Andrews. Lastly, Barrowman then begins rapidly listing a list of Scottish inventions, such as the telephone, tyre, television and the toilet to name a few.\nThe segment finishes with Dunbar singing alone on top of the bus with a model of the Forth Bridge. Dunbar then begins singing \"Welcome to Scotland\" followed by the volunteers used during the opening production waving into the camera as they run off the platform. Barrowman is then seen standing on a constructed model of the Finnieston Crane with the message \"Welcome to Glasgow\" displayed in an LED screen behind him.\nCome on In.\nDunbar welcomes the crowd to the games and the broadcast cuts to thousands of spectators watching the ceremony at Glasgow Green. Amy MacDonald performs a rendition of \"Rhythm of My Heart\" in George Square with the public of Glasgow. Following a pre-recorded segment in George Square, MacDonald then sings part of the song in the stadium before welcoming Rod Stewart who then finishes off the song.\nArrival of the Queen.\nAs with tradition at Commonwealth Games opening ceremonies, the Flag of India, Flag of Scotland and the Flag of Australia are raised, with India hosting the previous games in 2010, Scotland hosting the current games in 2014, and Australia hosting the next games in 2018. Susan Boyle performs a rendition of \"Mull of Kintyre\" to usher in Queen Elizabeth II accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The British national anthem \"God Save the Queen\" was then performed. The Red Arrows fly over by, with blue and white smoke to symbolise the 2014 Commonwealth Games being held in Scotland.\nArrival of the Queen's Baton.\nThe Queen's Baton is flown into Glasgow on a sea plane that lands on the River Clyde and is carried by broadcaster and cyclist Mark Beaumont.\nTartan display.\nIn preparation for the Parade of Nations, volunteers perform to \"Feel So Close\" by Scottish DJ Calvin Harris, and music included by Andy Stewart as a tribute to his contribution to Scottish music and culture. Volunteer dancers are then seen erecting chairs for the athletes which were sourced across Glasgow. 500 volunteer dancers were used for this segment of the ceremony.\nParade of Nations.\nThe ceremony was directed by David Zolkwer and included the 2014 Commonwealth Games Parade of Nations where 71 athletes, bearing the flags of their respective nations and territories, led their national delegations as they paraded into the stadium. The games were formally opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. She referred to the Commonwealth's \"shared ideals and ambitions\" and the \"bonds that unite\" its members.\nDuring the Parade of Nations at the 2014 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, held on 23 July 2014, 71 athletes bearing the flags of their respective nations lead their national delegations as they paraded into Celtic Park in the host city of Glasgow, Scotland. Each team was led out by a Scottish Terrier, wearing a jacket bearing the name of the country, followed by the flag bearer for that nation.\nAs the host of the last games, India entered first, followed by the rest of the Asian countries competing. Following this was Oceania, Africa, the Caribbean, the Americas and finally Europe. The Scotland team entered last, representing the host nation. In all cases nations entered in alphabetic order of their country names in English within their regions (besides India and Scotland).\nIn honouring the victims of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tragedy that occurred the week before the opening ceremony, the Malaysian delegation was led by eight athletes in Malaysia Airlines cabin crew uniform while the remaining athletes and officials wore black armbands, and the national flag was at half mast. A minute's silence was also observed.\nCountries and flagbearers.\nBelow is a list of parading countries and their announced flag bearer, in the same order as the parade. This is sortable by country name, flag bearer's name, or flag bearer's sport. Names are given in the form officially designated by the CGF. The first team to enter the stadium was India, host of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, maintaining the tradition of the immediate previous host nation entering first.\nProgramme.\nThe programme, which included about 2,000 performers, featured Karen Dunbar, John Barrowman, Amy Macdonald, Rod Stewart, Susan Boyle, Nicola Benedetti, Julie Fowlis, Pumeza Matshikiza, Eric Whitacre and the National Youth Choir of Scotland, as well as a message from the International Space Station. The ceremony began with a countdown and a recorded video message from Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, explaining the partnership between the Games and UNICEF.\nFollowing the arrival of the Queen there was a flypast by the Red Arrows display team. The venue featured the largest LED video screen in Europe, supplied by Sports Technology. Scotland's then First Minister Alex Salmond welcomed the participants and spectators, and introduced a moment of silence in memory of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster.\nThe final part of the Queen's Baton Relay was run by 32 Scottish volunteers nominated for giving their time to developing the nation's youth through sport. The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device.\nThe Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children’s lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\"\nBroadcast.\nThe ceremony was broadcast by BBC One, and was introduced by Gary Lineker, Hazel Irvine, Clare Balding and Huw Edwards. The estimated worldwide television audience was one billion, with 9 million in the UK."

He returned during the 2013 Vodacom Cup, scoring one try in six starts before a haul of 32 points in fourteen appearances was not enough to prevent his side finishing bottom of the log during the 2013 Currie Cup First Division."

In addition to the two Test matches, Wales also played a warm-up uncapped match against domestic club side . The three matches coincided with the June International Window, playing in the second and third week of the window.\nWales entered the test series on the back of 14 consecutive losses to South Africa; the last time Wales won against South Africa was in June 1999, the only time Wales have beaten South Africa. Wales were on 16 consecutive losses to the Southern Hemisphere greats, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, with the last time they beat a Southern Hemisphere great was in November 2008, and have not won an away match to the Southern Hemisphere greats since 1969.\nThe 14 consecutive losses to South Africa were extended to 16, while the 16 consecutive losses to the Southern Hemisphere greats were extended to 18 following a 2–0 series defeat. The only win of the tour came in the un-capped match against the , 34–12.

The failure of the Welsh regions to qualify for the 2013–14 Pro12 play-offs meant that, for many of the players, there would be a five-week gap between the end of the season and the first Test. The teams were announced on 13 May, with the Probables squad to be coached by Rob Howley, and the Possibles squad by Robin McBryde. The match fell outside the international window, so players based outside Wales were not required to be released to play, in accordance with IRB regulations. No players based in England were released for the match, while all the France-based players selected for the match except Dan Lydiate ended up participating.\nTrial match.\nNote: Bold text denotes players who are internationally capped.\nTouring squad.\nHead coach Warren Gatland named a 32-man squad following the trial match, for the two-test series against South Africa. It included 19 players from the Probables squad, 10 from the Possibles squad and three who did not feature in the trial match.\nHead coach: Warren Gatland\nNote: Caps and ages are as of the date of the first test match, 14 June 2014.\nSouth Africa.\nOn 31 May, head coach Heyneke Meyer named a 36-man squad for the 2-test series against Wales, and the single test match against Scotland, plus the uncapped match against a World XV side.\nOn 2 June, Damian de Allende was withdrawn from the squad due to injury. He was replaced by Marnitz Boshoff.\nOn 8 June, Trevor Nyakane was added to the squad to provide further cover at prop.\nNote: Caps and ages are as of the date of the first test match, 14 June 2014.\nThe following players were considered for selection, but not chosen due to injury or suspension.\nSouth African warm-up match.\nOn 7 June, South Africa played an uncapped warm-up match against a World XV in Cape Town, in the lead up to the Welsh series."

        "title": "European Professional Club Rugby",
        "text": "European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) is the governing body and organiser of the two major club rugby union tournaments: the European Rugby Champions Cup and the EPCR Challenge Cup. A third tournament, the European Rugby Challenge Cup Qualifying Competition was introduced as a qualification competition for clubs from minor nations to enter the Challenge Cup. EPCR shared control of this tournament with Rugby Europe, the international federation for rugby union in Europe, and with the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR). The tournament was discontinued after the 2018/19 season.\nThe organisation was established in 2014 in Neuchâtel, Switzerland and is now headquartered in Lausanne. Switzerland was chosen so as not to have the headquarters in any of the seven participating countries.\nEPCR has nine stakeholders – the six tier 1 unions whose national teams play in the Six Nations Championship, and the club bodies that represent the English, French, Scottish, Irish, Italian, Welsh and South African clubs in their respective leagues.\nThe inaugural competitions were held in the 2014/15 season.\nHistory.\nPrior to 2014, the pan-European club competitions - the Heineken Cup, and European Challenge Cup - were organised and run by European Rugby Cup Ltd. (ERC). ERC was created in 1995, following the advent of professionalism, by the then Five Nations Committee.\nIn 2012, Premiership Rugby and LNR, on behalf of the English and French clubs respectively, notified ERC that they would be withdrawing from the accord governing the competition, being dissatisfied with the organisation of the competition and the distribution of funding. Premiership Rugby subsequently refused to join any new agreement in which ERC remained organisers of European rugby tournaments.\nOn April 10, 2014 it was announced that the nine stakeholders with an interest in continuing major European club competition had come to an agreement for new competitions. Under the new agreement, ERC was wound up, and a new body, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR), would be created to organise three new competitions, European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup, and the third tier Qualifying Competition, beginning with the 2014/15 season.\nShortly after the establishment of EPCR, it was announced that the running of the inaugural 2014/15 tournament was to be handled in conjunction with ERC, the organisation it had been meant to replace, to facilitate a smooth transition. This was despite the latter having been described by chairman of Premiership Rugby, Quentin Smith, as \"no longer fit for purpose\". This was described as \"something of an about-turn\" by \"The Daily Telegraph\".\nSince the 2015/16 season, EPCR staff have been running the competitions from their base in Switzerland. In 2017 the qualifying competition was reconstituted as a fully fledged third competition, the European Rugby Continental Shield.\nEPCR governance.\nBoard of directors.\nEPCR is managed through a 9-person Board of Directors, which represents all stakeholders, and includes an independent chairman. The nine shareholders, by country, are listed below:\nThe EPCR independent chairman is Dominic McKay, who took over as interim chairman when Simon Halliday stepped down in October 2021. McKay was confirmed as permanent chairman in May 2022.\nExecutive committee.\nThere is also an executive committee, in charge of commercial matters relating to the tournaments, and preparations for Board meetings. This committee includes the Independent Chairman, Director-General, and three voting representatives, one representing each of the major European domestic leagues, the Top 14, the English Premiership and Pro14. Representation by English and French clubs on the three-person executive committee represents an increase in voting power for these two leagues as compared to the previous European Rugby Cup.\nJacques Pineau became the interim Director General of EPCR when the tournament began, and was responsible for the day-to-day operations of EPCR. On 29 April 2015, it was announced that Swiss national Vincent Gaillard had been appointed the Director General, and would work with Pineau until 1 July 2015, when he would officially take on the role. Anthony Lepage was appointed to the role of CEO on an interim basis in October 2021 when Gaillard stepped down.\nRevenue.\nRevenues generated by EPCR tournaments are divided in three equal parts — one third to Premiership Rugby clubs, one third to LNR clubs, and one third to URC clubs. Under the previous European Rugby Cup, the Irish, Welsh, Scottish and Italian clubs had received 52% of revenues, while the English and French clubs received 48%.\nEuropean Player of the Year.\nThe European Player Award was introduced by ERC in 2010, as part of their ERC15 awards, created to recognise the outstanding contributors of the first 15 years of European rugby. The first recipient of the award, considered the best player of the previous 15 years, was Munster Rugby's Ronan O'Gara. Following the award, and beginning with the 2010-11 Heineken Cup season, ERC began presenting a Player of the Year Award annually.\nEPCR continued the award after taking over the running of European competitions, and the first EPCR European Player of the Year Award was presented following the 2014-15 European Rugby Champions Cup season.\nThe most recent player to be awarded the accolade was Alex Goode in 2019.\nSince 2017, the Player of the Year has been awarded The Anthony Foley Memorial Trophy, commissioned in tribute to Anthony Foley, the former Munster head-coach.\nEPCR Elite Awards.\nThe Elite Awards were created by ERC, to celebrate the 10th anniversary season of the Heineken Cup. Introduced to recognise the most prominent teams and players of the competitions, EPCR has since maintained and continued the awards, updating them to include both Heineken Cup and European Rugby Champions Cup appearances."

The tournament was played between February 28 and March 15, 1986. First round and semifinal games were played at home team campus sites while the championship match was held at the DU Arena in Denver, Colorado. By winning the tournament, Denver was awarded the Broadmoor Trophy and received the WCHA's automatic bid to the 1986 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nFormat.\nAll member teams were eligible for the tournament and were seeded No. 1 through No. 8 according to their final conference standing, with a tiebreaker system used to seed teams with an identical number of points accumulated. The top four seeded teams each earned home ice and hosted one of the lower seeded teams.

        "text": "The 1982 AIAW Women's College World Series was held from May 20 through May 25 in Norman, Oklahoma. The final two games were postponed by rain for two days. Twelve Division I college softball teams met in what was to become the last AIAW softball tournament of that organization's history. After playing their way through the regular season and regional tournaments (and for Oklahoma State, a conference tournament), the 12 advancing teams met for the AIAW Division I college softball championship. Days later, Oklahoma State went on to participate also in the NCAA WCWS tournament in Omaha. In 1982, the Division I softball tournaments of both the AIAW and the NCAA were called \"Women's College World Series.\" That moniker has been used for the annual topmost-level collegiate women's softball tournaments since the first one in 1969. Historian Bill Plummer III wrote, \"With their 77-8 season record, Texas A&amp;M could have been a contender in Omaha − maybe even the top seed − against perennial softball powers like UCLA and Fresno State. The Aggies had been invited to the NCAA's first national tournament, but chose not to go. A&amp;M coach Bob Brock had high respect for the eleven-year-old AIAW, even as the NCAA began to overshadow it. Out of a sense of loyalty to the AIAW, Brock said, his school chose the 1982 Norman championship over the NCAA's first in Omaha.\"\nTeams.\nThe double-elimination tournament included these teams:\nTexas A&amp;M, Utah, Michigan and California were the top four seeds. Top-seeded Texas A&amp;M lost its opener in an 8-inning perfect game by USIU pitcher Jenny Stallard. But the Aggies battled back through the losers' bracket to claim the title by defeating Oklahoma State, who was unbeaten in the tournament to that point, twice in the championship final. In the deciding \"if-necessary\" game, the Aggies went to bat in the last regulation inning trailing the Cowgirls by one run. A double and an outfield error scored the tying run for A&amp;M, who went on to score twice in the extra inning for the 5-3 victory. Texas A&amp;M compiled a record of 7-1 in the tournament to become the first Texas A&amp;M women's varsity team to win a national championship.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics took place at Meilahti, Helsinki, Finland. The event was held from 20 to 23 July. There were 18 competitors from 18 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Yuriy Tyukalov of the Soviet Union, in the nation's debut at the Games. Defending champion Mervyn Wood took silver, the fourth medal in five Games for Australia. Teodor Kocerka's bronze was Poland's first medal in the men's single sculls.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nFive of the 14 single scullers from the 1948 Games returned: gold medalist Mervyn Wood of Australia, silver medalist Eduardo Risso of Uruguay, fourth-place finisher John B. Kelly Jr. of the United States, eighth-place finisher Ian Stephen of South Africa, and twelfth-place finisher Juan Omedes of Spain. Wood had also won his second Diamond Challenge Sculls earlier in 1952 and was the favorite. Significant challengers included Risso, Kelly, Tony Fox of Great Britain (1951 Diamond Challenge winner), Paul Meyer of Switzerland, and Ian Stephen of South Africa.\nChile, Saar, and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 10th appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course returned to the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948).\nThe competition expanded from previous years to include a second repechage after the semifinals. This brought the tournament to five rounds total: quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final with two repechages after the first two rounds. \nFour heats were held in the first round. The first two boats in each heat advanced to the semifinals, while the rest went to the first repechage. The repechage round also consisted of four heats. Only the winner of each heat advanced to the second repechage (these rowers did not compete in the semifinals). The winners of the two semifinal heats advanced directly to the final and the rest competed in the second repechage. Three heats were held in the second repechage, where the winner of each heat advanced to the final."

        "text": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament in Brazil cost US$11.6 billion, and was the most expensive World Cup at the time. It was surpassed by the 2018 FIFA World Cup, however, which cost an estimated $14.2 billion. FIFA spent an estimated $2 billion on the 2014 finals, with its greatest single expense $576 million in prize money. Other expenditures were largely for stadium renovation and other infrastructure projects, since Brazil undertook substantial construction to facilitate hosting the tournament.\nBrazilian investment.\nStadiums.\nAlthough the organisers originally estimated costs of $1.1 billion, $3.6 billion was reportedly spent on stadium work. Five host cities built venues for the World Cup. The Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha stadium in Brasilia (the capital) was demolished and rebuilt, and six were renovated. Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, which held the attendance record for a FIFA World Cup final match (199,854), was the largest stadium and hosted the final. The CBF originally intended to host the opening match at São Paulo's Estádio do Morumbi, but was replaced in 2010 by the Arena Corinthians after it failed to financially guarantee required improvements.\nThe first new stadium, the Castelão, in Fortaleza, opened in January 2013. Six venues were used for the 2013 Confederations Cup, but six additional stadiums missed FIFA's 31 December 2013 completion deadline. The completion of the new Arena Corinthians was hampered by a fatal crane collapse in November 2013 which destroyed part of the stadium and killed two construction workers. Slow progress at the Arena da Baixada in Curitiba made FIFA threaten to drop the stadium as a host venue in January 2014 unless significant progress was made during the following month; after satisfactory progress, FIFA confirmed that Curitiba would remain a host city.\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, the first games were held at venues in Manaus (Arena da Amazônia), Natal and Porto Alegre. After inspecting all the venues in May 2014, FIFA secretary Jérôme Valcke expressed concerns about the readiness of the Natal, Porto Alegre and São Paulo venues and required additional test events. Brazil's Deputy Sports Minister, Luis Fernandes, replied that there was \"no panic\".\nInfrastructure projects.\nIn January 2010, the Brazilian federal government estimated that hosting the tournament would require a government investment of $11 billion. The government announced tax breaks for construction and renovation of stadiums for the World Cup; host cities would be exempt from VAT, and FIFA spending in Brazil would be tax-free.\nThe government earmarked R$3 billion (€1.8 billion, or £1.1 billion) for investment in projects related to the World Cup, and introduced a World Cup PAC. In March 2007, Brazil announced an additional PAC investment of $526 billion from 2011 to 2014.\nAirports were identified as \"the big problem\" by the tournament's organizing committee, and experts said that Brazil's airports needed considerable renovation and expansion to accommodate those arriving for the World Cup. An estimated 600,000 people flew to the tournament, and three million traveled by air between matches. Legislation was introduced to enable Infraero, Brazil's airport operator, to facilitate airport improvements. The government had problems implementing infrastructure legislation, and forecast in 2011 that 10 of the 13 terminals scheduled for upgrading were unlikely to be completed by 2014. President Dilma Rousseff said that the government would make \"a strong intervention\" to ensure that the airports were ready, however, including private investment; management of three airports was transferred to the private sector in 2013 for $10.8 billion.\nMajor infrastructure projects were implemented across the country on roads, light rail and bus rapid transit lines connecting Brazil's airports to its city centres and stadiums; an estimated of highways were improved. To host the increased number of tourists, the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) provided a budget of R$2 billion to modernise and increase the country's hotel network. In Rio de Janeiro, the improvements also anticipated the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nPlanned projects such as monorail systems in Manaus and São Paulo and a subway system in Belo Horizonte were cancelled, and others were not expected to be finished before the World Cup; other projects were downsized. In May 2014, it was reported that 36 of the planned 93 major projects were completed. FIFA secretary-general Jérôme Valcke defended the progress, saying that \"it was clear from the beginning not all the projects would be ready ... these projects were part of a government plan that goes far beyond the World Cup\", and the organization pledged to spend at least $20 million on \"legacy projects\" in Brazil after the tournament.\nThe government's failure to complete all the originally-planned projects was criticised by some Brazilians, who also opposed its investment in the World Cup. An opinion poll by Datafolha two months before the start of the tournament indicated that 48 percent of respondents supported the tournament, a decline from 79 percent in 2008; 55 percent of respondents said that the event would be a net negative for Brazil. According to FIFA President Sepp Blatter, \"Brazilians are a bit discontented because they were promised a lot\".\nFootballer-turned-politician Romário criticised his country's handling of the preparations and said that \"FIFA's requirements were excessive\". Ronaldo, another former Brazilian player, said that he was \"embarrassed\" by the state of the country's infrastructure and that \"a series of investments were promised that won't be delivered - only 30 percent will be delivered\".\nAccording to a group of German economists, hosting a sports event of this magnitude by a newly industrialized country like Brazil or Russia was an economic luxury. They suggested two measures to make such events sustainable: building less and economic support from the organizing associations. Large stadiums and streets were unused after an event, negatively impacting the ratio of investment to assets. For this reason, the group feared that Olympic Games and football world championships would only be hosted in countries with authoritarian regimes.\nSecurity.\nThe Brazilian government pledged $900 million for security forces, and said that the World Cup would be \"one of the most protected sports events in history\". The government planned to have one police officer for every 50 people attending matches, and one for every 80 people at viewing events around the country.\nInvestments in security measures such as facial recognition systems and unmanned security robots were made. An integrated security plan was developed which sought information about potential terrorists and troublemakers. A total of 150,000 public security professionals and military was planned to ensure security, along with 20,000 private security personnel.\nSecurity concerns increased after protests during Brazil's staging of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which disturbances occurred outside stadiums. Protesters cited the amount of public money being invested by the Brazilian government in the World Cup at the expense of social services for its population.\nHuman cost.\nThe projected financial cost to the Brazilian government was estimated at $14 billion. In May 2014 in Brasília, the nation's capital, indigenous protesters clashed with police on horseback during a protest of the World Cup; one policeman shot in the leg, and police fired tear gas into the crowd to disperse the protest.\nAn indigenous population of 10 to 20 of Brazil's 300 ethnic groups was evicted from an abandoned museum next to Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, reportedly for the construction of a parking lot.\nFIFA investment.\nFIFA forecast that it would spend $2 billion to stage the 2014 World Cup Final."

        "title": "Bob Brown (baseball, born 1876)",
        "text": "Robert Paul Brown (July 5, 1876 – June 17, 1962) was an American-born Canadian professional baseball player, manager, and team owner. He was active in minor league baseball in various capacities from 1900 through 1953, appearing in over 600 games as player and managing for at least 14 seasons. He was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and served in the U.S. military during the Spanish–American War.\nBaseball career.\nAs a player, Brown was listed at and ; he threw right-handed. He played primarily as an outfielder and middle infielder. Note that minor league baseball records from the era that Brown was a player and manager are often incomplete.\nPlayer.\nBrown's professional baseball career spanned 1900 to 1917, with gaps, and a final season in 1926. In 1900, he started his minor career with the Helena Senators, where he was teammates with Joe Tinker. Early career stops included Pendleton, Oregon; Portland, Oregon; and Aberdeen, Washington, where in 1904, where he was catcher, manager and ran a shoe store. His longest stay with a single team was with the Aberdeen Pippins of the Southwest Washington League during 1903–1905. Baseball records do not list him as playing professionally during 1908; he returned to play in 1909 with the Spokane Indians and in 1910 with the Vancouver Beavers. After not playing professionally during 1911–1914, he resumed playing with Vancouver in 1915 and 1916, and in Fort Dodge, Iowa, in 1917. Records also show him playing 34 games in the Southwestern League in 1926, when he was also manager of the team based in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Brown appeared in at least 666 minor league games as a player.\nManager.\nBrown was a manager for all or part of 14 seasons, as early as 1902 and as late as 1926. For many of those season, he was also a player. He first managed the Pendleton team in 1902, and then managed every season from 1904 through 1911, including four seasons in Aberdeen. After managing in Vancouver in 1910 and 1911, he did not manage for four seasons, then returned to manage in Vancouver during 1916, 1917, 1920, and 1922. His final season as a manager was 1926 with Ponca City, also his final season as a player.\nOwner.\nBetween the 1909 and 1910 seasons, Brown took over sixty percent ownership of the Vancouver Beavers for $500, moving to Canada to take on the role of the team's player-manager. While Brown owned the Beavers, manager Kitty Brashier guided the team to Northwestern League championships in 1911; the Beavers were also champions in 1913 and 1914, while the team was second in the league in 1912.\nBrown also owned the Vancouver Beavers (later the Vancouver Capilanos). As a promoter, he organized the first night baseball game played in Canada, in 1930. Brown had built 5,000-seat Athletic Park on land leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The park opened 18 April 1913. The Beavers moved from Recreation Park that same year. He also initiated the building of Capilano Stadium, a 5,157-seat baseball stadium which opened 1951 in Vancouver.\nBrown retired as owner of the Capilanos in 1953, the year he became President of the Western International League, a post he held only one year. He was named honorary league president in 1954, and honorary president of the Vancouver Mounties in 1956.\nHonours.\nIn 1952, \"Sporting News\" named Brown one of the ten best general managers in baseball. In 1966, Brown was inducted as an inaugural member into the BC Sports Hall of Fame in the baseball category, and in 1989 he was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame as a builder. The Vancouver Canadians mascot is named “Bob Brown Bear” in honour of him.\nPersonal life.\nBorn on July 5, 1876, in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Brown attended the University of Notre Dame during the 1890s, where he played football with the Fighting Irish and won varsity letters in football and baseball. In 1898, he enlisted in the United States Army to fight in the Spanish–American War. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1900. Brown died on June 23, 1962, in St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver."

        "title": "Super Bowl 50",
        "text": "Super Bowl 50 was an American football game to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2015 season. The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers, 24–10. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. As this was the 50th Super Bowl game, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives during the 2015 season, as well as suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so the logo could prominently feature the number 50 in more familiar Arabic numerals.\nThe Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, racking up the league's top offense, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise began playing in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, bolstered by having the league's top defense. The Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game, joining the Patriots, Dallas Cowboys, and Pittsburgh Steelers as one of four teams that have made eight appearances in the Super Bowl. This record would later be broken the next season, in 2017, when the Patriots advanced to their ninth Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LI. This marked the fourth time in history that the Super Bowl pitted the top defense against the top offense, after Super Bowls XXV, XXXVII and XLVIII.\nIn one of the most defensive matchups in Super Bowl history, the Broncos took an early lead that they never lost. Denver recorded seven sacks and forced four turnovers. Carolina kept pace by recording five sacks and forcing two turnovers. Denver linebacker Von Miller was named Super Bowl MVP. This game was the final game of Peyton Manning's career; the Broncos quarterback, who also won Super Bowl XLI, announced his retirement in March 2016.\nCBS' broadcast of the game was the fifth most-watched program in American television history with an average of 111.9 million viewers. The network charged an average of $5 million for a 30-second commercial during the game. The Super Bowl 50 halftime show was headlined by Coldplay, with special guest performers Beyoncé and Bruno Mars.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nIn early 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the league planned to make the 50th Super Bowl \"spectacular\" and that it would be \"an important game for us as a league\".\nCities included in early discussions or that submitted bids included:\nThe league eventually narrowed the bids to three sites: New Orleans' Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Miami's Sun Life Stadium, and Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium.\nThe league announced on October 16, 2012, that the two finalists were Sun Life Stadium and Levi's Stadium. The South Florida/Miami area has previously hosted the event 10 times (tied for most with New Orleans), with the most recent one being Super Bowl XLIV in 2010. The San Francisco Bay Area last hosted in 1985 (Super Bowl XIX), held at Stanford Stadium in Stanford, California, won by the home team 49ers. The Miami bid depended on whether the stadium underwent renovations. However, on May 3, 2013, the Florida legislature refused to approve the funding plan to pay for the renovations, dealing a significant blow to Miami's chances.\nOn May 21, 2013, NFL owners at their spring meetings in Boston voted and awarded the game to Levi's Stadium. The $1.2 billion stadium opened in 2014. It was the first Super Bowl held in the Bay Area since Super Bowl XIX was held at Stanford Stadium in 1985 following the 1984 season, and the first held in California since Super Bowl XXXVII held in San Diego in 2003.\nTeams.\nFor the third straight season, the number one seeds in the NFC and AFC, the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos, met in the Super Bowl. The game also featured the league's top scoring offense (Panthers) against the league's top defense (Broncos). The Panthers became the 10th team since 1960 to have lost just one game during the regular season, and the sixth team ever to have a 15–1 record. It was their second Super Bowl appearance; the other was Super Bowl XXXVIII. The Broncos became the fourth team to have eight Super Bowl appearances, then the NFL record. It was their second appearance in three years, having also reached Super Bowl XLVIII. Coincidentally, John Fox was the head coach of each team in their previous Super Bowl appearance.\nCarolina Panthers.\nDespite waiving long-time running back DeAngelo Williams and losing top wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin to a torn ACL in the preseason, the Carolina Panthers had their best regular season in franchise history, becoming the seventh team to win at least 15 regular season games since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in . Carolina started the season 14–0, not only setting franchise records for the best start and the longest single-season winning streak, but also posting the best start to a season by an NFC team in NFL history, breaking the 13–0 record previously shared with the 2009 New Orleans Saints and the 2011 Green Bay Packers. With their NFC-best 15–1 regular season record, the Panthers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs for the first time in franchise history. Ten players were selected to the Pro Bowl (the most in franchise history) along with eight All-Pro selections.\nThe Panthers' offense, which led the NFL in scoring (500 points), was loaded with talent, boasting six Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl quarterback and regular season MVP Cam Newton had one of his best seasons, throwing for 3,837 yards and rushing for 636 yards, while recording a career-high and league-leading 45 total touchdowns (35 passing, 10 rushing), a career-low 10 interceptions, and a career-best quarterback rating of 99.4. Newton's leading receivers were tight end Greg Olsen, who caught a career-high 77 passes for 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns, and wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr., who caught 44 passes for 739 yards and 10 touchdowns; Ginn also rushed for 60 yards and returned 27 punts for 277 yards. Other key receivers included veteran Jerricho Cotchery (39 receptions for 485 yards), rookie Devin Funchess (31 receptions for 473 yards and five touchdowns), and second-year receiver Corey Brown (31 receptions for 447 yards). The Panthers' backfield featured Pro Bowl running back Jonathan Stewart, who led the team with 989 rushing yards and six touchdowns in 13 games, along with Pro Bowl fullback Mike Tolbert, who rushed for 256 yards and caught 18 passes for another 154 yards. Carolina's offensive line also featured two Pro Bowl selections: center Ryan Kalil and guard Trai Turner.\nThe Panthers' defense gave up just 308 points, ranking sixth in the league, while also leading the NFL in interceptions with 24 and boasting four Pro Bowl selections. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kawann Short led the team in sacks with 11, while also forcing three fumbles and recovering two. Fellow lineman Mario Addison added sacks. The Panthers defensive line also featured veteran defensive end Jared Allen, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, who was the NFL's active career sack leader with 136, along with defensive end Kony Ealy, who had five sacks in just nine starts. Behind them, two of the Panthers' three starting linebackers were also selected to play in the Pro Bowl: Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly. Davis compiled sacks, four forced fumbles, and four interceptions, while Kuechly led the team in tackles (118) forced two fumbles, and intercepted four passes of his own. Carolina's secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Kurt Coleman, who led the team with a career-high seven interceptions, while also racking up 88 tackles and Pro Bowl cornerback Josh Norman, who developed into a shutdown corner during the season and had four interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.\nDenver Broncos.\nAfter losing in the divisional round of the playoffs during three of the previous four seasons, the Denver Broncos' general manager John Elway made numerous coaching changes, including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox, who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach, being replaced in that role by Gary Kubiak, Elway's former backup quarterback and former Broncos offensive coordinator. Wade Phillips, a former Broncos head coach, returned to the team to serve his second stint as defensive coordinator, succeeding Jack Del Rio who had left to take the head coaching vacancy at the Oakland Raiders. The team's 43–8 loss in Super Bowl XLVIII two years earlier, despite holding the regular season's top offense, resulted in Elway signing defensive end DeMarcus Ware, cornerback Aqib Talib, safety T. J. Ward, and wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders for the 2014 season.\nUnder Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing style, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as the aging and injured Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in . In addition to turning 39 in the 2015 offseason, Manning suffered a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel during the summer. Though the team had a 7–0 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In Week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fascia in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but after throwing four interceptions, he was benched in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. After a slow start in Denver's final regular season game against San Diego, Osweiler was benched leading to Manning's return. Manning reclaimed the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed. Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who replaced his predecessor's complicated read-and-react scheme with a simple aggressive approach of attacking the ball, the Broncos' defense ranked No. 1 in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed and sacks, and like the previous three seasons, the team continued to set numerous individual, league and franchise records. With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense, the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.\nManning finished the year with a career-low 67.9 passer rating, throwing for 2,249 yards and nine touchdowns, with 17 interceptions. Osweiler threw for 1,967 yards and put up a better TD:INT ratio (10 touchdowns to six interceptions) for a higher rating of 86.4, but remained benched during the postseason in favor of Manning. Veteran receiver Demaryius Thomas led the team with 105 receptions for 1,304 yards and six touchdowns, while Emmanuel Sanders caught 76 passes for 1,135 yards and six scores, while adding another 106 yards returning punts. Tight end Owen Daniels was also a big element of the passing game with 46 receptions for 517 yards. Midway through the season, Denver acquired veteran tight end Vernon Davis, who finished the year with 38 receptions for 395 yards. Running back C. J. Anderson was the team's leading rusher 863 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 25 passes for 183 yards. Running back Ronnie Hillman also made a big impact with 720 yards, five touchdowns, 24 receptions, and a 4.2 yards per carry average. Overall, the offense ranked 19th in scoring with 355 points and did not have any Pro Bowl selections.\nThe Broncos' defense ranked first in the NFL yards allowed (4,530) for the first time in franchise history, and fourth in points allowed (296). Defensive ends Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson each had sacks. Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller led the team with 11 sacks, forced four fumbles, and recovered three. Linebacker DeMarcus Ware was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career, ranking second on the team with sacks. Linebacker Brandon Marshall led the team in total tackles with 109, while Danny Trevathan ranked second with 102 tackles. Cornerbacks Aqib Talib (three interceptions) and Chris Harris Jr. (two interceptions) were the other two Pro Bowl selections from the defense, though none of the players selected for the Pro Bowl participated due to the Broncos reaching Super Bowl 50.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Panthers defeated the Seattle Seahawks 31–24 in the NFC divisional round. The Panthers then defeated the Arizona Cardinals in the NFC Championship Game 49–15, racking up 487 yards and forcing seven turnovers.\nThe Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 23–16 in the AFC divisional round, by scoring 11 points in the final three minutes of the game. The next week, they defeated the defending Super Bowl XLIX champion New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game 20–18, by intercepting a pass on a New England 2-point conversion attempt that followed a Gronkowski touchdown reception with 17 seconds left on the clock. The Broncos recovered the subsequent onside kick attempt ensuring victory.\nPre-game notes.\nCarolina suffered a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran who had already overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game. Despite this, he insisted he would still find a way to play in the Super Bowl. His prediction turned out to be accurate and he made it into the starting lineup.\nPeyton Manning reached his fourth Super Bowl, with appearances under as many head coaches (Tony Dungy, Jim Caldwell, John Fox, and Gary Kubiak). He became the first quarterback ever to lead two teams to multiple Super Bowls. He was also the oldest quarterback ever to play in a Super Bowl at age 39. The previous record was held by John Elway, who led the Broncos to victory in Super Bowl XXXIII at age 38 and is currently Denver's Executive Vice President of Football Operations and General Manager.\nManning and Newton set the record for the largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26). In addition, this was the first Super Bowl to feature a quarterback on both teams who was the #1 pick in their draft classes. Manning was the No. 1 selection of the 1998 NFL Draft, while Newton was picked first in 2011. The matchup also pits the top two picks of the 2011 draft against each other: Newton for Carolina and Von Miller for Denver.\nWith Ron Rivera having been a linebacker with the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, and Kubiak replacing Elway at the end of the Broncos' defeats in Super Bowls XXI and XXIV, this was the first Super Bowl in which both head coaches played in the game themselves; coincidentally, the coaches they had played under, Mike Ditka (Rivera) and Dan Reeves (Kubiak), not only had Super Bowl playing experience themselves, but had done so as teammates with the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls V and VI (and worked together as Cowboys assistant coaches for Super Bowls X, XII and XIII).\nConcerns were raised over whether Levi's Stadium's field was of a high enough quality to host a Super Bowl; during the inaugural season, the field had to be re-sodded multiple times due to various issues, and earlier in the 2015 season, a portion of the turf collapsed under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker, causing him to slip and miss a field goal, although the field has not had any major issues since. As is customary for Super Bowl games played at natural grass stadiums, the NFL re-sodded the hybrid Bermuda 419 turf playing surface prior to the game; NFL and Atlanta Braves field director Ed Mangan stated that the field was in \"great shape\" for the game. However, the turf showed problems throughout the game, with a number of players needing to change their cleats during the game and players slipping during plays all throughout the game.\nAs the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Broncos elected to wear their road white jerseys with matching white pants. Elway stated, \"We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms.\" The Broncos last wore matching white jerseys and pants in the Super Bowl in Super Bowl XXXIII, Elway's last game as Denver QB, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34–19. In their only other Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XXXII, Denver wore blue jerseys, which was their primary color at the time. They also lost Super Bowl XXI when they wore white jerseys, but they are 0–4 in Super Bowls when wearing orange jerseys, losing in Super Bowl XII, XXII, XXIV, and XLVIII. The only other AFC champion team to have worn white as the designated home team in the Super Bowl was the Pittsburgh Steelers; they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21–10 in Super Bowl XL 10 seasons prior. The Broncos' decision to wear white meant the Panthers would wear their standard home uniform: black jerseys with silver pants.\nTeam facilities.\nThe Panthers used the San Jose State practice facility and stayed at the San Jose Marriott. The Broncos practiced at Stanford University, the alma mater of General Manager John Elway, and stayed at the Santa Clara Marriott.\nMarketing.\nOn June 4, 2014, the NFL announced that the game would be branded with Arabic numerals as \"Super Bowl 50\"—rather than with Roman numerals, a practice established at Super Bowl V under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\". NFL creative director Shandon Melvin explained that a primary reason for the change was the difficulty in designing an aesthetically pleasing logo with the letter \"L\" using the standardized logo template introduced at Super Bowl XLV. He noted that \"L\" was harder to design around as it is asymmetrical unlike other Roman numerals, and also showed concerns that use of the letter \"L\" could be interpreted as the \"loser\" hand gesture. 73 mockups, incorporating either \"L\" or \"50\", were designed before the final design was chosen, which featured large numerals colored in gold behind the Vince Lombardi Trophy, instead of underneath and in silver as in the standard logo.\nTying into the game's \"golden anniversary,\" various gold-themed promotions and initiatives were held throughout the 2015 NFL season. The league adopted a gold-tinted logo, which was implemented across all of the NFL's properties and painted on fields during the season. The numbering of the 50-yard line on fields was colored gold, and beginning on Week 7, all sideline jackets and hats featured gold-trimmed logos. Gold footballs were given to the high schools of players and coaches that had participated in a Super Bowl, and \"homecoming\" events were also held by Super Bowl-winning teams at games.\nTen themed \"50\" statues were placed in locations across San Francisco to promote the game; however, due to the negativity towards the game by residents of the city, the statues notably became the target of vandals, with the \"SUPER BOWL 50\" lettering on their bases re-arranged to form other phrases such as \"SUPERB OWL\", \"SUP BRO 50\", and after the Alamo Square statue was toppled, \"OOPS\".\nSuper Bowl week events.\nThe annual NFL Experience was held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. In addition, \"Super Bowl City\" opened on January 30 at Justin Herman Plaza on The Embarcadero, which featured exhibits showcasing the culture of the Bay Area. More than a million people were expected to attend the festivities in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. San Francisco mayor Ed Lee said of the highly visible homeless presence in this area \"they are going to have to leave\". San Francisco city supervisor Jane Kim unsuccessfully lobbied for the NFL to reimburse San Francisco for city services in the amount of $5 million.\nOrganizers announced plans for $2 million worth of other ancillary events, including a week-long event at the Santa Clara Convention Center, a beer, wine and food festival at Bellomy Field at Santa Clara University, and a pep rally. The city council announced plans to set aside seed funding for the event. For the first time, the Super Bowl 50 Host Committee and the NFL openly sought businesses owned by the LGBT community and disabled veterans for Business Connect, a program that provides local companies with contracting opportunities in and around the Super Bowl.\nThe game's media day, which was typically held on the Tuesday afternoon prior to the game, was moved to the Monday evening and re-branded as \"Super Bowl Opening Night\". The event was held on February 1, 2016, at SAP Center in San Jose. Alongside the traditional media availabilities, the event featured an opening ceremony with player introductions on a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nPhilanthropy.\nThe Super Bowl 50 Host Committee vowed to be \"the most giving Super Bowl ever\", and dedicated 25 percent of all money it raised for philanthropic causes in the Bay Area. The committee created the 50 fund as its philanthropic initiative and focuses on providing grants to aid with youth development, community investment and sustainable environments.\nTrophy.\nIn addition to the Vince Lombardi Trophy that all Super Bowl champions receive, the Broncos also received a large, 18-karat gold-plated \"50\". Each digit weighs for a total of . Like the Lombardi Trophy, the \"50\" was designed by Tiffany &amp; Co.\nVolunteers.\nAfter putting out a call for volunteers in June 2015, over 450 volunteers helped to make the Super Bowl 50 Tour happen. More than 5,000 volunteers were on hand to help with events leading up to, during and after Super Bowl 50 as well. Volunteers signed up for a minimum of 3–4 hour shifts, and some volunteers gave more than 200 hours of their time over the course of the week. As a thank you for volunteering, volunteers were gifted backpacks and uniforms.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the game was televised by CBS as part of a cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL. The network's lead broadcast team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms called the contest, with Tracy Wolfson and Evan Washburn on the sidelines. This would prove to be the last Super Bowl that Phil Simms called as color commentator, as he would serve his last season as lead color commentator the next season, before moving to \"The NFL Today\" in 2017, in which he would be replaced by Tony Romo, who would end up calling CBS' next Super Bowl three years later.\nCBS introduced new features during the telecast, including pylon cameras and microphones, and Intel freeD instant replay technology (branded on-air as \"EyeVision 360\", as a successor to a previous \"EyeVision\" employed at Super Bowl XXXV)—using an array of 36 5K resolution cameras along the upper deck that were used to provide 360-degree views of plays and \"bullet time\" effects, and the debut of a major re-branding of the CBS Sports division, including a new logo and on-air graphics.\nOn December 28, 2015, ESPN announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to provide a dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50, airing on ESPN Deportes and streaming on WatchESPN, featuring commentary and surrounding coverage in the language; unlike Fox and NBC, CBS does not have a Spanish-language cable network that could have carried such a broadcast. The production utilized CBS's video, but with Spanish-language graphics provided by ESPN, and its \"Monday Night Football\" commentary crew of Alvaro Martin, Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe also contributed reports for the English-language ESPN as part of efforts to promote the simulcast. ESPN Deportes' vice president of programming Freddy Rolon felt that dedicated Spanish-language coverage appealed better to Hispanic viewers than Spanish commentary on the SAP audio channel, going on to say that \"I have family members who watch Spanish language television and they don't know where that SAP button is to begin with\".\nAs opposed to broadcasts of primetime series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, beginning with a special live episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" following the game, with a sketch featuring a pre-recorded appearance by Barack Obama, and guests Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, and Megyn Kelly. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\".\nWith an average television audience of 111.9 million, the game was the third most-watched Super Bowl—and third most-watched U.S. program—in history, according to the Nielsen ratings. It was also the most-watched program of all time in terms of total audience, 167-million, which measures those who viewed at least six minutes of the broadcast. Average viewership is the industry standard for determining television ratings, while total audience is a supplemental metric. The Spanish-language broadcast on ESPN Deportes was seen by an average of 472,000 viewers; it ranked behind Super Bowl XLVIII as the second-most-watched Spanish-language cable telecast in U.S. history, outside of soccer games.\nAdvertising.\nCBS set the base rate for a 30-second advertisement at $5 million, a record high price for a Super Bowl ad. As of January 26, the advertisements had not yet sold out. CBS mandated that all advertisers purchase a package covering time on both the television and digital broadcasts of the game, meaning that for the first time, digital streams of the game would carry all national advertising in pattern with the television broadcast. This would be the final year in a multi-year contract with Anheuser-Busch InBev that allowed the beer manufacturer to air multiple advertisements during the game at a steep discount. It was also the final year that Doritos, a longtime sponsor of the game, held its \"Crash the Super Bowl\" contest that allowed viewers to create their own Doritos ads for a chance to have it aired during the game. Nintendo and The Pokémon Company also made their Super Bowl debut, Hyundai placed in both first and fifth place respectively on \"USA Today\"s Super Bowl Ad Meter survey, with their ads \"First Date\" (for the Hyundai Genesis) and \"Ryanville\" (for the 2017 Hyundai Elantra).\nFirst-time advertisers at Super Bowl 50 included Amazon.com, Colgate toothpaste, Death Wish Coffee (who beat 10 other small businesses in a contest held by Intuit, who paid for the ad time as a prize), LG Electronics, Marmot, Nintendo (promoting the 20th anniversary of the \"Pokémon\" franchise), PayPal, and SoFi.\n20th Century Fox, Lionsgate, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Studios paid for movie trailers to be aired during the Super Bowl. Fox paid for \"Deadpool\", ', ' and \"Eddie the Eagle\", Lionsgate paid for \"Gods of Egypt\", Paramount paid for ' and \"10 Cloverfield Lane\", Universal paid for \"The Secret Life of Pets\" and the debut trailer for \"Jason Bourne\" and Disney paid for ', \"The Jungle Book\", and \"Alice Through the Looking Glass\".\nStreaming.\nCBS provided digital streams of the game via CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports apps on tablets, Windows 10, Xbox One and other digital media players (such as Chromecast and Roku). Due to Verizon Communications' exclusive mobile rights to the NFL, streaming on smartphones was only provided to Verizon Wireless customers via the NFL Mobile service.\nAlthough CBS had launched its own over-the-top streaming service, CBS All Access, in October 2014, it would not be until December 2016 that the NFL would start to allow CBS game broadcasts to be streamed on that site.\nRadio.\nNational coverage.\nWestwood One carried the game throughout North America, with Kevin Harlan as play-by-play announcer, Boomer Esiason and Dan Fouts as color analysts, and James Lofton and Mark Malone as sideline reporters. Jim Gray anchored the pre-game and halftime coverage.\nLocal market coverage.\nThe flagship stations of each station in the markets of each team carried their local play-by-play calls. In Denver, KOA (850 AM) and KRFX (103.5 FM) carried the game, with Dave Logan on play-by-play and Ed McCaffrey on color commentary. In North Carolina, WBT (1110 AM) carried the game, with Mick Mixon on play-by-play and Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke on color commentary. WBT also simulcast the game on its sister station WBT-FM (99.3 FM), based in Chester, South Carolina. As KOA and WBT are both clear-channel stations, the local broadcasts were audible over much of the western United States after sunset (for Denver) and the eastern United States throughout the game (for Carolina). In accordance with contractual rules, the rest of the stations in the Broncos and Panthers radio networks either carried the Westwood One feed or did not air the game at all.\nInternational broadcasts.\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra carried the contest. As in previous years, the BBC aired its own commercial-free British English broadcast, with Greg Brady, Darren Fletcher and Rocky Boiman on commentary. The game was broadcast live in India on Sony SIX.\nEntertainment.\nPre-game.\nIn honor of the 50th Super Bowl, the pregame ceremony featured the on-field introduction of 39 of the 43 previous Super Bowl Most Valuable Players. Bart Starr (MVP of Super Bowls I and II) and Chuck Howley (MVP of Super Bowl V) appeared via video. The late Harvey Martin, co-MVP of Super Bowl XII who died in 2001, was acknowledged when the other co-MVP of Super Bowl XII, Randy White, was introduced. Peyton Manning (MVP of Super Bowl XLI and the Broncos' starting quarterback for the game) was shown in the locker room preparing for the game. This ceremony continued a ten-year tradition (starting with Super Bowl XX and then repeated in Super Bowl XXX and Super Bowl XL) in which past Super Bowl MVPs were honored before the game.\nLady Gaga (accompanied by Alex Smith on piano) sang the national anthem, while Marlee Matlin simultaneously performed an American Sign Language (ASL) version of it. Matlin also signed an a cappella version of \"America the Beautiful\", which was sung by a U.S. Armed Forces chorus.\nHalftime show.\nIn late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that \"multiple acts\" would perform during the halftime show. On December 3, the league confirmed that the show would be headlined by the British rock band Coldplay. On January 7, 2016, Pepsi confirmed to the Associated Press that Beyoncé, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show and collaborated with Coldplay on the single \"Hymn for the Weekend\" (which was removed from the setlist before the game), would be making an appearance. Bruno Mars, who headlined the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, and Mark Ronson (Mars's collaborator on \"Uptown Funk\") also performed.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nDenver took the opening kickoff of Super Bowl 50 and started out strong. Quarterback Peyton Manning completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Owen Daniels and a 22-yard throw to wide receiver Andre Caldwell. A pair of carries by running back C. J. Anderson moved the ball up 20 yards to the Panthers 14-yard line, but Carolina's defense dug in over the next three plays. First, linebacker Shaq Thompson tackled running back Ronnie Hillman for a 3-yard loss. Then after an incompletion, linebacker Thomas Davis tackled Anderson for a 1-yard gain on third down, forcing Denver to settle for a 3–0 lead on a Brandon McManus 34-yard field goal. The score marked the first time in the entire postseason that Carolina was facing a deficit.\nAfter each team punted, Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appeared to complete a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery, but the call was ruled an incompletion and upheld after a replay challenge. CBS analyst and retired referee Mike Carey stated he disagreed with the call and felt the review clearly showed the pass was complete. Two plays later, on 3rd-and-10 from the Panthers 15-yard line, linebacker Von Miller strip-sacked Newton, and defensive tackle Malik Jackson recovered the ball in the end zone for the first touchdown of the game, giving the Broncos a 10–0 lead. This was the first fumble return touchdown in a Super Bowl since Super Bowl XXVIII at the end of the 1993 season.\nAfter a punt from both teams going into the second quarter, Carolina got on the board with a 9-play, 73-yard scoring drive. Newton completed all four of his pass attempts for 51 yards and rushed twice for 25 yards, while running back Jonathan Stewart finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 10–7 with 11:28 left in the half. Later on, Broncos receiver Jordan Norwood received Brad Nortman's short 28-yard punt surrounded by Panthers players, but none of them attempted to make a tackle, apparently thinking Norwood had called a fair catch. Norwood had not done so, and with no resistance around him, he took off for a Super Bowl record 61-yard return before Mario Addison dragged him down on the Panthers 14-yard line. That record would be broken seven years later when Kadarius Toney returned a punt 65 yards in the late stages of Super Bowl LVII. Despite Denver's excellent field position, they could not get the ball into the end zone, so McManus kicked a 33-yard field goal that increased their lead to 13–7.\nOn Carolina's next possession, fullback Mike Tolbert lost a fumble while being tackled by safety Darian Stewart, which linebacker Danny Trevathan recovered on the Broncos 40-yard line. However, the Panthers soon took the ball back when defensive end Kony Ealy intercepted Manning, returning the ball 19 yards to the Panthers 39-yard line with 4:23 left on the clock. The Panthers could not gain any yards with their possession and had to punt. After a Denver punt, Carolina drove to the Broncos 45-yard line. With 11 seconds left and no timeouts, Newton was sacked by linebacker DeMarcus Ware to end the first half.\nSecond half.\nThe Panthers seemed primed to score on their opening drive of the second half when Newton completed a 45-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr., which was the longest pass play of the game for either team, on the Denver 35-yard line on their second offensive play. However, the Broncos defense halted the drive on the 26-yard line, and it ended with no points when Graham Gano hit the right upright on a 44-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Manning completed a pair of passes to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 25 and 22 yards, setting up McManus's 33-yard field goal that gave the Broncos a 16–7 lead. Carolina got off to another strong start after the kickoff, with Newton completing a 42-yard pass to Corey Brown. But once again they came up empty, this time as a result of a Newton pass that bounced off the hands of Ginn and was intercepted by safety T. J. Ward. Ward fumbled the ball deep in Denver territory during the return, but Trevathan was able to recover the ball enabling Denver to keep possession.\nThere would be no more scoring in the third quarter, but early in the fourth, the Broncos drove to the Panthers 41-yard line. On the next play, Ealy knocked the ball out of Manning's hand as he was winding up for a pass, and then recovered it for Carolina on the 50-yard line. A 16-yard reception by Devin Funchess and a 12-yard run by Stewart then set up Gano's 39-yard field goal, cutting the Panthers deficit to one score at 16–10. The next three drives of the game would end in punts.\nWith 4:51 left in regulation, Carolina got the ball on their own 24-yard line with a chance to mount a game-winning drive, but they soon faced 3rd-and-9. On the next play, Miller strip-sacked Newton for the second time in the game, and after several players dove for the ball, it took a long bounce backwards and was recovered by Ward, who returned it five yards to the Panthers 4-yard line. Newton was the third player to attempt a recovery (following Ware and Mike Remmers) of the ball and while various angles appeared to show that he had a decent probability of recovery if he'd dived in his attempt, Newton instead hesitated and then tried to drop on top of the ball, which failed. This split-second decision later earned him criticism. Meanwhile, Denver's offense was kept out of the end zone for three plays, but a defensive holding penalty on cornerback Josh Norman gave the Broncos a new set of downs. Then Anderson scored on a 2-yard touchdown run and Manning completed a pass to wide receiver Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, giving the Broncos a 24–10 lead with 3:08 left and essentially putting the game away. Carolina, now playing for pride, had two more drives and managed one first down before the game ended.\nGame statistics.\nManning finished the game 13 of 23 for 141 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked five times. Sanders was his top receiver with six receptions for 83 yards. Anderson was the game's leading rusher with 90 yards and a touchdown, along with four receptions for 10 yards. Miller had six total tackles (five solo), sacks, and two forced fumbles. Ware had five total tackles and two sacks. Ward had seven total tackles, a fumble recovery, and an interception. McManus made all three of his field goals, making him perfect on all 10 attempts during the post-season.\nNewton completed 18 of 41 passes for 265 yards with one interception, two fumbles, and was sacked seven times. He was also his team's leading rusher with 45 yards on six carries. Brown caught four passes for 80 yards, while Ginn had four receptions for 74 yards. Ginn was sacked once on a trick play. Ealy was the top defensive performer for Carolina with four total tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, and an interception. Defensive end Charles Johnson had four total tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble. Linebacker Luke Kuechly had 11 total tackles and a sack, while Thomas Davis had seven total tackles, despite playing just two weeks after breaking his right arm in the NFC title game.\nSuper Bowl 50 featured numerous records from individuals and the two teams. Denver won despite being massively outgained in total yards (315–194) and first downs (21–11). Their 194 yards and 11 first downs were both the lowest totals ever by a Super Bowl winning team, as the previous record was 244 yards by the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Only seven other teams had ever gained fewer than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and all of them had lost. The Broncos' seven sacks tied a Super Bowl record set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. Manning was sacked five times by the Panthers, giving this game highest total (12) of combined sacks in Super Bowl history. Kony Ealy tied a Super Bowl record with three sacks, and is the only such player to do so and record an interception. Jordan Norwood's 61-yard punt return set a new record, surpassing the old record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. Denver was just 1-of-14 on third down, while Carolina was 3-of-15. The two teams' combined third down conversion percentage of 13.8 was the lowest in Super Bowl history. Manning and Newton had quarterback passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, and their added total of 112 is a record lowest aggregate passer rating for a Super Bowl. Manning became the oldest quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl at age 39, the first quarterback ever to win a Super Bowl starting for two teams, and the first quarterback ever to win 200 games (regular season and postseason) as a starter. Gary Kubiak became the first head coach to win a Super Bowl with the same franchise he went to the Super Bowl with as a player.\nManning announced his retirement from the NFL a month after the Super Bowl. This was also the final game in the career of Panthers defensive lineman Jared Allen, who retired as the NFL's ninth all-time leader in sacks.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nSources:\n1Completions/attempts\n2Carries\n3Longest gain\n4Receptions\n5Times targeted\nStarting lineups.\nSource:\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl 50 had nine officials. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers.\nAftermath.\nUpon receiving the Lombardi Trophy, Broncos general manager and former quarterback John Elway raised it and exclaimed \"This one's for Pat!\" in reference to owner Pat Bowlen, who had been diagnosed the year before with Alzheimer's disease. Bowlen had saluted Elway in the same fashion after the Broncos won their first championship in Super Bowl XXXII 18 years earlier.\nThis was Denver's first sports championship since the Colorado Rapids won the MLS Cup in 2010. The 2016 NFL season began with the Broncos hosting the Panthers at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. It was the first meeting of both Super Bowl participants during Week 1 of the following season since the 1970 season when the Minnesota Vikings and Kansas City Chiefs held a rematch of Super Bowl IV to kick off the post-merger era of the NFL. The Broncos won 21–20 as Carolina's Graham Gano missed a field goal attempt to win the game.\nBoth teams would ultimately struggle during the season and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Panthers fell to 6–10 and finished in last place in the NFC South. The Broncos fell to 9–7 and came in third place in the AFC West. This was the first time the defending AFC and NFC champions would both miss the playoffs since the 2003 season, after Super Bowl XXXVII, when neither the Oakland Raiders nor the Tampa Bay Buccaneers qualified for the postseason, and the fifth time overall.\nAs of 2024, Super Bowl 50 remains the most recent playoff game played by the Broncos, as they have yet to qualify for the postseason since.\""

Porter most recently played professionally for Irish provincial side Connacht in the Pro12, and has also played for his native province of Ulster.\nCareer.\nUlster.\nThough he also played amateur rugby for Belfast Harlequins and Banbridge, Porter's first professional rugby club was Ulster. Porter came through Ulster's academy system, playing for the Under-19 and Under-20 sides, and in 2009 was nominated for the province's 'Academy Player of the Year' award.\nIn January 2010 it was announced that Porter was among nine players who had signed contracts with Ulster, meaning he would play for the senior side starting in the 2010–11 season. He made his full debut for the senior side on 11 September 2010 in the 2010–11 Celtic League, coming off the bench against Italian side Aironi. He also featured off the bench against Edinburgh and Cardiff Blues. However, having started off the season as second choice to Paul Marshall at scrum-half, the signing of Ruan Pienaar saw him drop to third choice and Porter finished the season with just three league appearances, all as a replacement.\nIn the 2011–12 season, Porter continued as third choice, making five replacement appearances in the 2011–12 Pro12, the league having been renamed. Porter took a one-year sabbatical from playing the following season and did not feature for Ulster, returning in 2013. He returned from his long absence with an appearance from the bench against Newport Gwent Dragons in the 2013–14 Pro12 on 6 September 2013. Porter made his first-ever senior start for the province the following week against Glasgow Warriors. Porter left Ulster at the end of the 2013–14 season.\nConnacht.\nIt was announced in May 2014 that Porter had agreed a deal Ulster's Irish rivals Connacht. He signed a two-year contract and joined the team ahead of the 2014–15 season. Porter signed as cover to Connacht's Kieran Marmion, replacing outgoing players Frank Murphy and Paul O'Donohoe."

The Spartans, led by second year head coach Dave Wojcik, played their home games at the Event Center Arena and were members of the Mountain West Conference.\nDue to APR penalties, San Jose State were ineligible for postseason tournament play, including the Mountain West tournament.\nFollowing a 7–24 season in 2013–14, the Spartans finished the season 2–28, 0–18 in Mountain West play to finish in last place. They failed to defeat a Division I opponent.\nPreseason.\nNCAA academic sanctions.\nUnder previous head coach George Nessman, San Jose State reported five consecutive years of rising four-year average Academic Progress Rate (APR) scores, including a program-best 940 in the 2011–12 season (because of a perfect one-year 1000 score). However, the APR fell below 930 for the 2012–13 season, Nessman's last as head coach. As a result, the NCAA imposed sanctions on the San Jose State men's basketball program in April 2014. These sanctions included:\nAthletic director Gene Bleymaier stated in response to the sanctions: \"Last year, we were faced with a situation that needed to be dealt with in a major fashion. The coaching staff was not retained, and several players were not invited back for the 2013-14 season. Only four players returned from the 2012-13 team.\nRoster.\nSuspensions and dismissals.\nCoach Dave Wojcik announced on December 13, 2014 that five players were suspended indefinitely due to violating team rules: Jordan Baker, Rashad Muhammad, Matt Pollard, Frank Rogers, and Jaleel Williams. As a result, two San Jose State football players—wide receiver Tyler Winston and tight end Andrew Vollert—joined the roster temporarily. Vollert and Winston became the first San Jose State football players since the 1988–89 season to have played football and basketball the same season. The last time that happened followed the walkout of 10 basketball players in protest over alleged verbal abuse by coach Bill Berry, who was fired after the season.\nFive days after the five players were suspended, associate head coach Chris Brazelton was placed on paid administrative leave. Ultimately, Muhammad and Williams were reinstated on January 3, 2015. Baker and Rogers were dismissed from the team, and Pollard transferred.\nInjuries.\nOn December 3, 2014, Jalen James suffered a season-ending ankle injury. Six days later, Leon Bahner was diagnosed with the same injury and was also sidelined the rest of the season. Devante Wilson did not play at all in the season due to injury.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#005a8b; color:#c79900;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#005a8b; color:#c79900;\"| Regular season"

Light flyweights were limited to those boxers weighing less than 49 kilograms (108.02 lbs).\nLike all Commonwealth boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament.

Seven-time Paralympian Liesl Tesch was one of the team's founding members, who was named the first overall MVP in 2000, and played for the team in 2017. The team became the Sydney University Flames in 2010, and won the league championship in 2019.\nSydney Metro Blues.\nThe Sydney Metro Blues were also one the league's original teams, as the North Sydney Bears. As such, they won the league championship in 2001. They subsequently became the Goudcamp Gladiators, and then the Sachs Goudcamp Bears in 2011. They assumed their current identity of the Sydney Metro Blues in 2016, and won the league championship in 2017.\nKilsyth Cobras.\nAnother of the original teams, the Kilsyth Cobras began as the Victorian Wheelies in 2000. They subsequently became the Dandenong Rangers, and won the league championship in 2011 and 2012 with players including Amanda Carter and Shelley Chaplin. In 2015, the team became affiliated with the Kilsyth Cobras, a club that also fields teams in the men’s and women’s sections of the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL), the Victorian Youth Championship Competition (VYC), the Victorian Junior Basketball League (VJBL) and the National Wheelchair Basketball League (NWBL). The Kilsyth Cobras went through the 2015 season undefeated, posting a 16–0 record that still stands, and claimed the league championship.\nPerth Wheelcats.\nThe Perth Wheelcats (Formerly Be Active Western Stars) joined the league in 2006.

        "title": "School cricket in Sri Lanka",
        "text": "Cricket was introduced in Sri Lanka during the 19th century by the British. A Sri Lankan school was the first to play cricket in 1864, primarily against small clubs. With the arrival of English cricketer Ashley Walker and the founding of Royal College, Colombo, Sri Lanka's first inter-school match took place between S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia and Royal College in 1880. An annual match, known as the Battle of the Blues, was held. \nThe sport became popular in British Empire colonies, including Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia and Royal College, Colombo began to play cricket, and large schools in Kandy, Galle, Matara, and Jaffna have included cricket in their sports programs; it gradually became Sri Lanka's most popular sport. The Sri Lankan government recognized cricket as a national sport and enacted infrastructure projects for it. Schools were financially encouraged to offer cricket programs, helping to provide national teams to represent Sri Lanka at the international level.\nGovernance.\nSri Lanka Cricket.\nSri Lanka Cricket (SLC), formerly known as the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL), is the sport's national governing body. With the expansion of school cricket in Sri Lanka, it became necessary for SLC to work with a separate association in activities relevant to school cricket.\nSri Lanka Schools Cricket Association.\nA group of school principals devised the idea for the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) in 1930. Wesley College, Colombo principal J. S. Carter helped form the association in 1948, and was its first president. The SLSCA organizes island-wide, interscholastic tournaments and appoints officers at the scholastic level, providing a platform for players and teams to gain recognition by hosting age-group (U13 to U19) tournaments.\nSLSCA interscholastic tournaments.\nThe SLSCA conducts tournaments in accordance with the Laws of Cricket and the International Cricket Council (ICC). Its tournament committee has full authority on all matters relating to games. All SLSCA-affiliated schools are eligible to participate in association tournaments.\nSchool and tournament categories.\nSchool Cricket is divided by age into four leagues: U13 (under 13 years old), U15 (13 to 15-year-olds), U17 (15 to 17-year-olds), and U19 (17 to 19-year-olds). According to a team's ranking in its age group, each league has three divisions: I, II, and III. Tournaments are held annually on a fixed schedule, and usually last for several months.\nU19.\nU19 divisions I and II begin their tournaments in September, continuing until the end of February. Division III plays two-day league matches from September to the end of January.\nU17 and U15.\nU17 and U15 tournaments begin around May (after the U19 season), and continue until August.\nU13.\nU13 tournaments begin around September, after the U17 and U15 seasons.\nPromotion and demotion.\nU19.\nThe top two Division II teams, with the highest average points at the main tournament, are promoted to Division I. The Division III champion and runner-up, decided by a knock-out tournament, are eligible for Division II. Tournaments are held in Divisions I and II for the three schools in each division with the lowest average points in two-day tournaments. The two schools with the lowest average points are demoted one division (Division I schools to Division II, and Division II schools to Division III).\nU17 and 15.\nThe two teams from Divisions I and II which rank last in the points table are demoted to Divisions II and III, respectively, and the two top teams in Divisions II and III are promoted to Divisions I and II.\nUnder 19 championships.\nThe most prestigious U19 tournament is the one-day provincial tournament, with major teams from Kandy, Colombo, and Dambulla. Galle has a two-day league tournament with group matches in all three divisions. The two teams which top the points table in Divisions I and II are declared champions, and a Division III champion is not selected.\nThirty Division I, 14 Division II, and four Division III teams play a two-day limited overs tournament. The 48 teams play 12 first-round group matches (12 groups), and the 12 group leaders and four best runners-up play knock-out matches in the final round for the championship. In addition to this tournament, a knock-out game is played by teams completing five matches in the Division III two-day tournament to select the champion of that division."

England were captained by David Gower; the West Indies by Viv Richards. In addition, the teams played a four-match One Day International (ODI) series which the West Indies won 3–1.\nBackground.\nEngland had just beaten Australia 3–1 in the 1985 Ashes. As with the 1980–81 tour, Guyana’s government rigidly refused to admit cricketers who had ever played in apartheid South Africa, so England did not visit there. Antigua Sports Minister Lester Bird wished leading rebel player Graham Gooch to apologise and to promise he would never return to South Africa until apartheid was dismantled. To compensate two Tests were scheduled for Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, but for a time it was feared that the government there would follow Guyana and Bird and exclude or demand apologies from those linked to South Africa.\nTour.\nThe tour began poorly for England, losing by seven wickets to the Windward Islands despite a 77 from Mike Gatting and five wickets from Phil Edmonds. They almost lost their next game, against the Leeward Islands. After batting well in the first innings (Gatting, Gooch, Robinson and Lamb all scoring half centuries) England collapsed in the second and were lucky to escape with a draw.\nThings improved when they beat Jamaica, chiefly due to the batting of Gatting and Lamb and the bowling of Edmonds.\nGatting had been England's in-form batsman, but in the first one-day game his nose was broken. England collapsed and the West Indies won easily.\nGatting was unable to play in the first test, which the West Indies won easily. Richard Ellison took a five wicket haul and Peter Willey scored a second innings 71, forcing the West Indies to bat again, but England were unable to resist the West Indies fast bowlers, especially debutant Patrick Patterson, and the game was over inside three days.\nEngland's next game, against Trinidad and Tobago, was a draw.\nThey bounced back to win their next game, a one-day international against the West Indies due to a century from Graham Gooch.\nFor the Second Test England decided to go with four specialist batsmen and lost the game. England's star players (especially Ian Botham) continued to struggle, while Richie Richardson made a century and Malcolm Marshall took eight wickets. Assisted by John Emburey's bowling and a last wicket stand from Richard Ellison and Greg Thomas, England managed to take the match into a fifth day and take three of the mere five second-innings West Indies wickets they would take all series, but these were meagre achievements.\nThe tour went downhill even further when they lost to Barbados by three wickets.\nThe West Indies easily won the next one day international. They won the 3rd test by an innings and 30 runs. Then they won the 4th ODI by eight wickets.\nThe West Indies won the 4th test by ten wickets. They won the 5th handsomely as well, Viv Richards scoring a century in 56 balls, which was at the time the fastest in terms of balls faced in Test match history.\nOne Day Internationals (ODIs).\nWest Indies won the series 3–1."

The Third Test, in which the West Indies were captained by Desmond Haynes, resulted in a draw; following an injury to Gooch in that match, Allan Lamb replaced him as captain for the final two Tests, both of which were won by the West Indies.\nIn addition to the Tests, the teams played a five-match Limited Overs International (LOI) series which the West Indies won 3–0.

They scored 244 for six in their fifty overs. In reply, the West Indies levelled the score off the final ball of the fiftieth over and had lost five wickets compared with the six lost by Pakistan. Normally, when scores are level, the match is awarded to the team losing the least wickets and so, under the rules, the West Indies would have won. However, the crowd invaded the field before play on the final ball was completed. A Pakistani fielder threw the ball to Wasim Akram at the bowler's end and he saw the chance of a run out at the striker's end if he could return the ball to the wicket-keeper, but, with the pitch already overrun by spectators, he had no chance of doing this and the batsman could not be run out.

        "title": "List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies",
        "text": "The decision of FIFA to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar sparked a number of concerns and controversies regarding both Qatar's suitability as a host country and the fairness of the FIFA World Cup bidding process. Some media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups have criticised Qatar's record of human rights violations; Qatar's limited football history; the high expected cost; the local climate; and alleged bribery in the bidding process. Not all nations competing have put focus on concerns.\nCriticism of human rights in Qatar focused on the treatment of migrant workers, women, and position on LGBT rights, leading to allegations of sportswashing. Others have cited Qatar's intense climate and lack of a strong football culture, as well as evidence of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption. Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players, while former FIFA President Sepp Blatter has twice said that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \"mistake\". Match attendance figures have also come under scrutiny as reported crowd attendances have exceeded stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats. Over the past 5 years, the government has engaged closely with the ILO (international labor organization), international trade union, NGOs, etc. The Guardian reported it all in its article published on 23 October 2022. The article included statements from workers involved in building infrastructure of the World Cup 2022. A survey among 1,000 low-wage workers found that 86% of respondents felt that the labor reforms had positively affected their lives. Now workers can negotiate for better conditions, and employers are incentivized to provide them in order to attract and retain talent. Legislation has also been introduced to the minimum wage, on protecting outdoor workers during the summer months, and on the election of migrant worker representatives within companies. Change to the kafala system has led to labor mobility. Another report by the United Nations claimed that “Qatar is changing. The new kafala system tranche of law will bring an end to kafala and put in place a modern industrial relations system” said Sharan Burrow, General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation. This was published on October 17, 2019, before the world cup took place.\nIncumbent FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended the hosting of the tournament in Qatar. Others have suggested that Qatar's human rights record is better than those of Russia and China, nations which received less widespread criticism for similar issues when hosting major sporting events in the years prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar have been described as a cultural conflict or \"Clash of Civilizations\" between authoritarian Islamic regimes and secular liberal democracies. The Qatari tournament is widely regarded as one of the most controversial FIFA World Cups in history.\nHuman rights concern.\nIn a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations. After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures \"misleading\" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24. Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar already has started a Workers' Support and Insurance Fund to help workers which successfully reimbursed US$320 million this year alone to victims through the Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022. Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country. She praised \"the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar. In an article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, \"We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all.\"\nLGBT issues.\nBecause of Islamic sharia law, there are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of fans, as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.\nThe main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-coloured armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination; though not specifically in support of LGBT+ rights, nor targeting Qatar's lack, the rainbow symbol was deemed offensive to the hosts. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the European teams, FIFA told the teams that they would receive a yellow card as a minimum.\nSecurity officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing, flags featuring rainbows, whether Pride-related or not, and reportedly intimidated fans. American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.\nPre-tournament.\nStadiums.\nEnvironmental impact.\nEach stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch. With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be desalinated. The process damages the marine environment. Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels. As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage. The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised.\nOne of the eight stadiums, Stadium 974, was designed to be able to be disassembled so that it could be moved elsewhere, in an effort to counter the negative effect of requiring upkeep of unused stadiums. The large PR campaign promoting this was criticised by activists, as it overlooked the other stadiums being constructed in Qatar. Stadium 974 and the organising committee pledge that the tournament would be carbon neutral were also criticised as attempts to greenwash Qatar, the nation with the highest per-capita emissions, especially as carbon neutrality was planned to be achieved by planting trees to offset emissions generated by the tournament, rather than use alternative energies. Stadium 974, located at a port, does not have air conditioning; due to the climate of Qatar, the other seven stadiums do, with the systems running on fossil fuels.\nCorruption.\nThere have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee. There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including Theo Zwanziger and Sepp Blatter—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament.\n2011.\nIn May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice-president Jack Warner, an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via Mohammed bin Hammam who was president of the Asian Football Confederation at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing. A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar. She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them. She also denied being put under any pressure to make her retraction. FIFA confirmed receiving an email from her which stated her retraction.\n2014–15.\nIn March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member Jack Warner and his family almost $2 million. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that it understands that the U.S. FBI is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.\nOn 1 June 2014, \"The Sunday Times\" claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5 million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges.\nLater in June 2014, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the Qatari Emir strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a zero-tolerance policy.\nIn an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".\nFIFA ethics investigation report.\nIn 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence. At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015. FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.\nMichael Garcia reacted almost immediately stating that the report is “materially incomplete” and with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\". In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg who claimed to have obtained the report wrote in a Facebook post that the report \"does not provide the proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought\" and stated that he would publish the full report bit by bit. This forced FIFA to release the original report as authored by the investigator Michael Garcia. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested rules of conduct to the limit. The report ended talks of a re-vote.\n2020.\nIn January, Bonita Mersiades, a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which Al Jazeera (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100 million if Qatar won the vote. According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of Jérôme Valcke, secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption. \"The Mail on Sunday\" asked beIN Sports about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as \"production contributions\" which were \"standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders\".\nAccording to leaked documents obtained by \"The Sunday Times\", Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.\nFIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to \"The Sunday Times\" in an email and wrote \"allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. FIFA is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities.\" A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not \"respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations.\"\nDamian Collins, a British Member of Parliament (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract \"appears to be in clear breach of the rules\".\nFormer UEFA president Michel Platini was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. He was detained at the Anti-Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris. The arrest represents the first substantial public move in an investigation into the Qatar decision opened two years ago by France's Parquet National Financier, which is responsible for law enforcement against serious financial crime.\nScheduling.\nThe notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the 2022 Winter Olympics, while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the Christmas season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian). The Premier League voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues. FA Chairman Greg Dyke said, shortly after he took his job in 2013, that he was open to either a winter tournament or moving the tournament to another country. FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar's desert state was a \"blatant mistake\", and that any potential shift to a winter event would be unmanageable due to the effect on major European domestic leagues.\nIn October 2013, a taskforce was commissioned to consider alternative dates, and report after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. In early 2014, FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke appeared to preempt this, saying: \"Frankly, I think it will happen between November 15 and the end of December because that is when the weather is more favourable. It's more like springtime in Europe\". This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice-president Jim Boyce responded in saying that \"it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned.\nIt was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015\".\nAnother option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe.\nFranz Beckenbauer, a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: \"One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable there\". \"Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East\". At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible, but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June–July games would be for the host association to propose. Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery.\nThe notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President Michel Platini's indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly. Platini's vote for the summer 2022 World Cup went to Qatar. FIFA President Sepp Blatter also said that despite air-conditioned stadiums the event was more than the games itself and involved other cultural events. In this regard, he questioned if fans and players could take part in the summer temperatures.\nIn addition to objections by European leagues, Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the A-League and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead. Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.\nIn September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The Fox Broadcasting Company who had paid $425 million for the right to broadcast both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the US, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's NFL season, which takes place in the winter and with whom Fox also has a lucrative broadcasting deal. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation.\nIn February 2015, FIFA awarded Fox the rights to the 2026 World Cup, without opening it up for bidding with ESPN, NBC, and other interested American broadcasters. Richard Sandomir of \"The New York Times\" reported that FIFA did so to avoid Fox from suing in U.S. courts, which under the American legal system could force FIFA to open up their books and expose any possible corruption. As BBC sports editor Dan Roan observed, \"It does not seem to matter to FIFA that rival networks ESPN and NBC may have wanted to bid, or that more money could have been generated for the good of the sport had a proper auction been held. As ever, it seemed, FIFA was looking after itself\".\nOn 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event was scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators noted the clash with the Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern for how short the tournament was intended to be. It was also confirmed that the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations would be moved from January to June to prevent African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country Guinea starts about that time.\nClimate.\nAs the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than . Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to \"Qatar Today\" magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would \"affect performance levels from a health point of view\" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that \"recovery times between games would be longer\" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, \"more mistakes would be made\". One of the doctors said that \"total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible\".\nThe inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was \"high risk\" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one.\nCost.\nBy some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220 billion (£184 billion). This is about 60 times the $3.5 billion that South Africa spent on the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in Munich that £107 billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31 billion on transport infrastructure. Ritter said £30 billion would be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £48 billion on training facilities and accommodation for players and fans. A further £28 billion will be spent on creating a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament.\nAccording to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch, the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organisers in Qatar have requested from FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wishes to cut the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned. A report released in December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that Qatar's neighbours could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to accommodate the people of the region during the tournament.\nPossible Israeli qualification.\nThe head of the Qatar bid delegation stated that if Israel were to qualify, they would be able to compete in the World Cup despite Qatar not recognising the state of Israel. Israel ultimately were eliminated during FIFA World Cup qualification, and thus did not compete at the tournament in Qatar.\nRussia's participation following its invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, FIFA stated that matches would not be held in Russia, though Russia would still be able to continue its participation in World Cup qualifying, where it had reached Path B. Also in Path B were Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden, all of which refused to play against Russia in any form (as did England, which had already qualified for the tournament).\nOn 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team had been ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. They may not compete under the name, flag, or national anthem of Russia: similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics, the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (\"RFU\") rather than \"Russia\". The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions \"until further notice\", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In July 2022, the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the Russian appeals and upheld FIFA's and UEFA's decisions.\nSome observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen, or Qatar for its human rights violations.\nQatari football record.\nAt the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, Qatar was ranked 113 in the world, and had never qualified for the World Cup before. The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the Arabian Gulf Cup twice, both times hosting. Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in 2019. Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of 1954 hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams). These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.\nThe Qatar Football Association has also been known to naturalise players from foreign nations for its own team. Examples include Sebastián Soria, Luiz Júnior and Emerson Sheik. The Qatar FA has previously attempted to offer incentives to uncapped players of other nations to switch allegiance to the Gulf state. These have included the German-based Brazilian trio of Aílton, Dedé and Leandro in 2004 – none of whom have ever played in or have other connections to Qatar – to help their team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. FIFA blocked the moves and as a result, tightened eligibility requirements for national teams.\nWith a 2–0 loss to Ecuador on the tournament's opening day, Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at the World Cup; Qatar subsequently lost 3–1 to Senegal in their second group match, becoming the first team to be eliminated from the tournament. They lost their final group game 2–0 to the Netherlands, becoming the first and only host to lose all their games, as well as the first host to finish 4th in their group and last overall.\nAlcohol.\nHassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the event. Specific fan-zones would be established where alcohol could be bought. Although expatriates may purchase alcohol and certain businesses may sell alcohol with a permit, drinking in public is not permitted as Qatar's legal system is based on Sharia.\nIn February 2022, the communications executive director at the supreme committee, Fatma Al-Nuaimi, stated in an interview that alcohol would be available in designated fan zones outside stadiums and in other Qatari official hospitality venues. In July 2022, it was reported that while fans would be allowed to bring alcoholic beverages into the stadiums, alcoholic beverages would not be sold inside the stadiums. But according to a source, \"the plans are still being finalised.\" However, on 18 November 2022, days before the first match, Qatar officially banned alcoholic beverages from sale within the eight stadiums. The ban only applied to regular fans, and alcohol was still available to FIFA officials and wealthy guests.\nOn 30 November 2022, \"The Times\" published an interview with some female fans attending FIFA World Cup 2022 games, with some of them saying that less drunkenness among other attendees made them feel safer at the stadiums than they expected.\nNovember 2022 Infantino communications.\n\"Focus on the football\" letter.\nOn 5 November 2022, Gianni Infantino and Fatma Samoura sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to \"respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world\" and to \"focus on the football\" as to \"not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\". Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as Australia, Belgium, Denmark, England, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people. All of the nations criticised the letter, stating \"FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case. History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate.\"\n\"Today I feel\" address.\nOn 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol. He opened by declaring that he \"felt\" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated. He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because \"for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people\". Infantino argued that none of the European companies \"who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region\" had taken steps to address the rights of migrant workers like FIFA had, and suggested that Europe needed to be more open to accepting refugees and migrant workers. He asked, \"do we want to continue to spit on the others because they look different, or they feel different? We defend human rights. We do it our way. We obtain results. We got women fans in Iran. The Women's League was created in Sudan. Let's celebrate. Don't divide.\" In response to a last-minute prohibition on the sale of alcohol inside the stadiums, Infantino stated that it was a decision made jointly by FIFA and the organising committee, but argued that FIFA was still in \"200% control\" of the event, prohibitions on the sale of alcohol at sporting events were not exclusive to Qatar, and joked that \"if this is the biggest issue we have for the World Cup then I will resign immediately and go to the beach to relax\". He once again argued that people should \"focus on the football\", and direct their criticism to FIFA and \"me if you want\" instead of Qatar.\nThe speech drew further criticism: The Associated Press labeled the speech an \"extraordinary diatribe\" and a \"tirade\" while \"The Guardian\" called it \"bizarre and incendiary\". Infantino was accused of deflecting criticism of Qatar's human rights record. Amnesty International criticised Infantino for \"brushing aside legitimate human rights criticisms\", Sky Sports pundit Melissa Reddy accused Infantino of engaging in whataboutism, while FairSquare director Nicholas McGeehan described the remarks as being \"as crass as they were clumsy\", and feeling like \"talking points directly from the Qatari authorities\". Writing for \"The Observer\", Barney Ronay described the address as being \"a wretched spectacle—not to mention myopic, tin-eared and oddly lost\", and felt that Infantino was \"clearly furious with his critics, furious that this thing cannot be bent to his will. And by the end it had become hugely engrossing just to see someone so blind to his own contortions, so shameless, and quite clearly losing his grip on his own spectacular.\"\nOpening ceremony and anthem.\nIn the weeks before the tournament began, singers Dua Lipa and Shakira announced that they had refused to perform at the opening ceremony and collaborate on the tournament anthem due to human rights violations implemented by the Emirate's internal policies. British singer Rod Stewart said he turned down a substantial offer to perform in the country: \"They offered me a lot of money, more than a million dollars, to perform there [in Qatar]. I turned it down. It's not right to go there.\" In addition, the league's ambassador, David Beckham, was criticized by the LGBT community in the United Kingdom for lending his face to the event in exchange for $10 million. Talking about the fact former Spice Girls member Melanie C, arguing that it is \"complex\" for sports to change culture when so much money is involved. British singer Robbie Williams defended his choice to participate as a guest at the opening event, stating: \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere. But, that being said, if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known. [...] You get this microscope that goes 'okay, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them'... I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere\".\nAfter the announcement of the collaboration for the World Cup anthem \"Tukoh Taka\", performed by Trinidadian rapper Nicki Minaj, Colombian singer Maluma, and Lebanese singer Myriam Fares, the three artists have been affected by a great deal of controversy for choosing to be paid to sing a song in an Emirate whose internal policies involve the violation of human rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, as well as the support of slavery and child exploitation. Singer Maluma replied to the charge by declaring: \"it's something I can't resolve; [...] It's not something that I actually have to be involved with. I'm here enjoying my music and the beautiful life, playing soccer too\".\nAmerican actor Morgan Freeman was criticised on social media by media outlets for participating in the tournament's opening ceremony, with references made to his acting performance as Nelson Mandela in the dedicated film \"Invictus\" (2009).\nIranian protests.\nIn October 2022, calls were made to ban the Iranian national team from the World Cup for the Iranian government's blocking of Iranian women from their stadiums, their supplying of weapons to Russia during the invasion of Ukraine, and the treatment towards protesters during the Mahsa Amini protests.\nSince the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the presence of Iranian women in Iranian stadiums had been illegal until October 2019 after the death of Sahar Khodayari, when select Iranian women were allowed to enter the stadium after 40 years for a World Cup qualifier. However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier, with authorities using pepper spray to disperse them.\nFormer Iranian national team goalkeeper Sosha Makani called on fans to either boycott the event or create slogans and chants that highlight the Iranian government's involvement of the deaths of protestors Nika Shakarami, Hadis Najafi, Asra Panahi and Sarina Esmailzadeh to prevent the government from using footage of them in the stands as propaganda, while ex-wrestling champion Sardar Pashaei called for a full ban of the national team until the government steps down.\nIn early November 2022, the Welsh government stated they would boycott the Group B Wales vs Iran match due to the protests in Iran.\nAhead of the country's opening game (Group B England vs Iran match), many Iranians boycotted their team as they felt it was representing the government. Ahead of that opening game against England, the Iranian team refused to sing the national anthem in solidarity with the Mahsa Amini protests, with some Iranian supporters cheering against their own team or boycotting their team as a result.\nIn the following match against Wales, amidst the boos and whistles from the Iranian supporters during the playing of the national anthem, the Iranian players were filmed singing the national anthem, with some protestors having their pre-revolutionary Lion and Sun flags and Women, Life, Freedom banners snatched from them by pro-government fans and stadium security at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Security guards at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium seized a flag with the inscription \"Woman. Freedom. Life\" from an Iranian fan before the Group B game between Iran and Wales. Reuters reported on several incidents involving Iranian fans at this game, including a man wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words \"Women, Life, Freedom\" being escorted by three security officers into the ground, but was unable to confirm why he was being given a security escort, as well as a Reuters photograph which showed a woman whose face was painted with dark red tears holding a shirt in the air with \"Mahsa Amini - 22\" on it. Another Iranian fan told Reuters that her friends had been prevented from entering the stadium due to their efforts to bring t-shirts reading \"Women Life Freedom\" but that she had managed to get one t-shirt through the security blanket outside the stadium. Protesters were harassed by government supporters with some protesters being detained by Qatari police, while stadium security confirmed they were given orders to confiscate anything but the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Protesters against the regime covered the lenses of security cameras with sanitary pads. One Iranian fan said Qatari police insisted she wash away the markings on her arms and chest, which commemorated those who had been killed by Iranian security forces. Documents obtained by Iran International showed Iran was coordinating secret efforts with Qatar to control who attends the World Cup and restrict any signs of dissent.\nPrior to what would be Iran's final fixture (Group B Iran vs United States match), Iran's state-run media called for the US team to be expelled from the tournament after the US Soccer Federation removed the Islamic Republic emblem from Iran's flag in a social media post. The US Federation confirmed it had done so to show support for Iranian protesters before deleting the post. FIFA did not comment on the issue.\nAhead of that concluding fixture against the United States, the Iranian players were reportedly called in to a meeting with members of the IRGC and threatened with violence and the torture of their families if they did not sing the national anthem or joined the protests against the Iranian regime. During the match, the Iranian players sang the national anthem again before losing to the United States 1–0 for the first time in their history, thereby being knocked out of the tournament. Many Iranians celebrated the defeat and one Iranian man was killed by security forces in Iran after honking his car horn in celebration. Another Iranian fan was arrested by Qatari police after he was wearing a shirt with the Woman, Life, Freedom slogan. Qatari police also stopped people from carrying the old Iranian flag and other banners.\nAfter the World Cup, it was revealed that the Iranian government had dispatched paid members of the Basij and IRGC to cheer for the team in the stands at both the World Cup and the Asian Cup in order to counter the protesters.\nTreatment of fans.\nJewish and Israeli fans.\nIt was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked \"kosher\" food and public Jewish prayer services at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities. Qatar alleged that they could not \"secure\" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.\nMultiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans. Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed. The Israeli government warned its citizens who are travelling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns. Moav Vardi of Kan 11 stated that Arab fan chants included, \"You are not welcome here, there is only Palestine, there is no such thing as Israel, Israel does not exist\", with some turning back when the Israeli reporters disclosed their nationality. Muslims and Morocco football team players also raised Palestinian flags during the matches.\nPaid fans.\nIn 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations. However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar. Many fans reportedly declined the offer. On 18 November 2022, it was reported that Qatar had cancelled the daily spending allowances for fans who were paid to attend the World Cup.\nDays prior to the start of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar was accused of reportedly having paid actors to play the role of fans at the tournament in order to promote the country. Qatar was similarly accused of having paid for supporters when it hosted the 2015 World Men's Handball Championship.\nDuring the World Cup, Nejmeh SC ultras from Lebanon were employed by the Qatari government to act as Qatar national team fans during their games. The 1,500 \"adopted\" ultras wore maroon t-shirts with \"Qatar\" stamped on front, sang the Qatari national anthem and beat drums while singing chants. According to the investigation by DW news in November 2022, this was a part of world cup networking program called as the Fan Leader Network which is aimed at \"individuals who are passionate about football and keen to share key information with their friends and contacts about Qatar's hosting of the FIFA World Cup 2022.” According to the Southern Sydney news site The Leader, the initiative involves about 1,600 fans from around the world as a part of this network. When asked about the ultras from Lebanon, the Supreme Committee denied that the fans were paid in exchange for \"coordinated promotion for the World Cup\" and issued a statement describing the report as \"absolutely false.” The DW fact check team claimed that they were unable to find any evidence that the fans shown in the videos had been paid for participating in the marches.\nAccommodation.\nIn the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners. This accommodation cost over $200 a night. A Greek salad which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no feta, served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable. These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated Fyre Festival. One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match. People who had stayed in another village complained about the air conditioning and beds: \"It has been hell. The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a [fighter jet] is taking off... [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor.\" However, article published by CNN during the World Cup claimed that the supporters who were on a budget and were unable to afford what's on offer from hotels, eight fan villages provide “casual camping and cabin-style” options. “There are so many cabins and containers and there's a big screen that we can all watch the games together.” Fei Peng, from China, who was there to watch over 30 World Cup games, told CNN Sport.\nDue to these issues, which Qatar officials say were caused by \"owner and operator negligence\", Qatar offered refunds to fans \"severely impacted\" by the issues.\nProvisions inside stadium.\nBrass band instrument confiscation.\nThough not connected to any protest against Iran, the official Wales brass band had their instruments confiscated before the Group B Wales vs Iran match. The brass band had been allowed to play at the previous Wales match (against the United States) and FIFA officially supported their attendance at the tournament.\nTicketing.\nMany England supporters missed the start of the Group B England vs Iran match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app. That day also, the FIFA app caused tickets belonging to fans of the United States team to disappear.\nThere were problems also with ticketing, first before, and then during, throughout, the Round of 16 Morocco vs Spain match on 6 December, including with FIFA's ticketing app.\nMedia incidents.\nSecurity interference.\nPrior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials. Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's TV 2 was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the Katara Cultural Village, who threatened him and attempted to break their camera. Tantholdt responded to the group, saying \"You have invited the whole world here. Why can't we film? It is a public place.\" Organisers apologised for the incident, claiming that it was a mistake.\nRTÉ journalist Tony O'Donoghue accused Qatari police of stopping him during efforts to film in the country on 17 November.\nWhile the tournament was underway, Argentine television presenter Joaquín 'El Pollo' Álvarez was intercepted by heavy-handed Qatari forces while he was in the middle of a live TV broadcast in a street of Barwa Village, a complex in Doha specifically designed for Qatar's hosting of the tournament. Álvarez was interviewing an old supported in a wheelchair, when he was stopped by Qatari forces, who asked him if he was an accredited media representative. When he was searching for his press pass in his bag, an official became irritated and ordered the cameraman to stop filming, claiming that the street was \"private\". \nÁlvarez said that the official threatened to arrest him, saying \"I was frightened and thought they were going to take me prisoner... It's impossible to work and enjoy a World Cup like this\". \nThe film crew were also threatened with the destruction of their equipment. Nicolás Magali, who was co-hosting the live broadcast from the TV studio in Argentina's capital Buenos Aires, told viewers: \"This is an example of severe censorship and we have to say so. They covered up the camera, didn't let us film, ordered you away in a rude fashion, and on top of that, the person doing the talking didn't identify himself\".\nGrant Wahl's death.\nAmerican soccer journalist Grant Wahl collapsed and died while covering the Netherlands vs. Argentina match in the early morning of 10 December 2022.\nWahl had experienced cold-like symptoms in the days prior, but felt better following a course of treatment from the World Cup medical centre. An outspoken critic of Qatar's selection as World Cup host, Wahl had been briefly detained while wearing a t-shirt depicting a rainbow at an earlier game during the tournament (United States vs Wales). Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, and his brother said he believes Wahl's death was the result of foul play, implicating the Qatari government as playing a role. Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he did not collapse but instead began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They have criticised the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl. In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene. An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture. Grant Wahl's brother later backtracked on his statement on the cause of his brother's death and stated he no longer suspects foul play.\nChinese censorship.\nCCTV, the state broadcaster and the official broadcaster of FIFA World Cup in mainland China, replaced footage of maskless audiences with close-ups of coaches, officials or players, or birds-eye view of stadiums in its broadcast, as scenes of maskless audiences fueled unrest with China's zero-COVID policy during ongoing protests. Following the protests, the Chinese government began to relax pandemic control measures and more images of audience without masks appeared on live telecast.\nAlgerian censorship.\nState-run TV2 of Algeria avoided coverage of the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match and Morocco's subsequent win, due to tensions between Algeria and Morocco. In addition, Algeria's state TV channel and the Algeria Press Service never mentioned Morocco's defeating Spain in the round of 16, although many Algerians celebrated Morocco's victory.\nAlthough the reason has not been revealed, a few hours after the result of Morocco defeated Portugal in the quarter-final was shown on TV3, the director general of Public Establishment of Television, Chabane Lounakel was dismissed by the Algerian government.\nWestern media coverage perceived as racist.\nMiddle East Eye, a web news portal accused of being funded and operated by Qatar, though the nation denies this, has described several Western media publications as racist, and criticised the nations from which they originate. It highlighted the French satirical newspaper \"Le Canard enchaîné\", which published a cartoon of bearded men wearing Qatar football jerseys holding knives, guns, and rocket launchers; and the German television network Welt, on which a presenter described the Tawhid Islamic salute performed by Moroccan players after they defeated Portugal as \"the signature hand gesture of members of ISIS\".\nAlso on Welt, former footballer Jimmy Hartwig used the word \"Ching Chang Chong\" and made a bow as typical Japanese do to describe the Japanese squad, and also called Japan \"Reisabteilung\", which means \"rice department\". After this, he was criticized for discrimination against Asians especially among Japanese people in Germany.\nE-newsletter \"Morocco World News\" criticised Danish television network TV 2, which it said was racist for a panel of presenters comparing the way Moroccan players reached over spectators to embrace their mothers to monkeys huddling, while the blog site \"Al Bawaba\" saw someone post criticism of Dutch newspaper \"de Volkskrant\" for printing on the day of their semi-final, a cartoon of Morocco players with shaved heads taking the World Cup trophy from Infantino.\nBBC controversies.\nHassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, called some of the BBC's coverage of the tournament \"extremely racist\" and charged Gary Lineker with not engaging with the organisers before criticising them directly. The BBC said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as \"racist\".\nAl Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story. He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage. In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April. A BBC spokesperson denied Al Thawadi's claims and said they had a duty to cover legitimate issues related to the World Cup without fear or favour. Lineker would go on to end his commentary of the tournament by stating that the United States, one of the co-hosts of the following World Cup, is “extraordinarily racist” in an attempt to show that he was willing to criticise any host country and had not only singled out Qatar for its issues while also mentioning that “every country has problems”.\nOn 19 November 2022, Jürgen Klinsmann, accused Iran of cheating in their 2–0 win over Wales whilst appearing as a pundit on the BBC. He stated that cheating in football matches is in Iranian culture. Referring to the referee's Guatemala nationality, he claimed that the result of the Iran and Wales match would have been different had the referee been from Europe. After his comments, Gabby Logan, the broadcast host, also mentioned that the linesman was also from Trinidad and Tobago.\nIsraeli media.\nIsraeli journalists tried to interview some Arab people but they were ignored and the interviewees just walked away once the former's nationality became known.\nBoycotts.\nTromsø IL of Norway released a statement calling for a boycott of the 2022 World Cup, in relation to reports of \"modern-day slavery\" and the \"alarming number of deaths\", among additional concerns in their statement. The club urged the Norwegian Football Federation to support such a boycott.\nIn reaction to the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Reinhard Grindel, the president of the German Football Association, stated in June 2017 that \"the football associations of the world should conclude that major tournaments cannot be held in countries with human rights abuses and that the German Football Association would talk with UEFA and the Cabinet of Germany in order to evaluate whether to boycott the tournament in Qatar in 2022. On 26 March 2021, the German Football Association stated that it was opposed to boycotting the tournament but that its players will campaign for improvement of human rights for all. On the same day, Belgium manager Roberto Martínez told CNN that it would be a \"big mistake\" to boycott the event.\nOn 20 October 2021, the German Football Association (DFB) published an interview on its website that confirmed that Germany would not boycott the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. According to vice-president Peter Peters, \"Qatar has seen many positive developments in the past few years, and it is football's role to support those developments.\"\nOn 27 March 2022, the Fourth High-Level Strategic Dialogue between the State of Qatar and the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) took place where the Gulf nation extended its donation to three more years. According to the recent report of UNOCT, Qatar remained the second-largest donor in the campaign amongst 35 other donors.\nIn October 2022, it was announced Paris had joined other French cities in boycotting the broadcasting of the 2022 tournament amid concerns over rights violations of migrant workers and the environmental impact of the tournament, despite the fact that Paris Saint-Germain, the city's Ligue 1 team, is owned by the Qatari government.\nIn November 2022, fans of Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, and Hertha Berlin unveiled banners calling for a boycott of the Qatar World Cup.\nCologne-based supermarket chain REWE cut all ties with the German Football Association (DFB) with immediate effect on 23 November as the company's CEO Lionel Souque moved to disassociate them from the sport, calling FIFA's actions in the early days of the tournament \"scandalous\", and even electing to waive its pre-existing advertising rights.\nMatch incidents.\nSerbian incidents.\nDuring the Group G Serbia vs Switzerland match on 2 December, midfielder Granit Xhaka twice provoked the entire Serbian team. First, in the 65th minute, Xhaka grabbed his crotch in the direction of Serbian players, causing the entire Serbian bench to angrily respond to him and Serbian reserve goalkeeper Predrag Rajković being booked. Second, at the end of the match, Xhaka got into a fight against Nikola Milenković for his chants against Serbians, with both players going into the referee's book.\nMany Serbian fans displayed slogans and attire related to the Yugoslav Wars, such as \"Serbia to Tokyo\", and made racist chants and gestures toward Albanians during the second half of the game. Between the two incidents between Xhaka and the Serbian players, FIFA issued a public address in the 77th minute of the game asking for \"discriminatory chants and gestures\" to stop. Also, according to a Kosovo Albanian fan, his Albanian flag around his neck was confiscated at the entrance before the game. Another fan was escorted out of the game by members of security after doing the Albanian double-headed eagle celebration.\nFurthermore, Xhaka, an ethnic Albanian, enraged Serbian fans by wearing a jersey with the surname of Jashari written on it while celebrating after having won the match. Despite his claims that he wore the jersey to show support to his young Switzerland teammate Ardon Jashari, Serbian fans and media interpreted the move as glorification of Adem Jashari, a Kosovo Albanian soldier who founded the Kosovo Liberation Army during the Kosovo War, and who is seen as a national hero amongst Albanians but as a terrorist amongst Serbs.\nFIFA later opened a disciplinary proceeding against Serbia over the breach of three of FIFA's articles, including misconduct of players, discrimination, and order and security at matches.\nCroatian incidents.\nXenophobic chants were reported during the course of the Group F Croatia vs Canada match on 27 November. During the match, Croatian fans chanted xenophobic anti-Serb slogans against Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, an ethnic Croatian Serb who fled Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence. They also displayed a modified John Deere banner making a reference to Operation Storm, a military operation that ended the war and abolished the separatist proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians. Serbs generally consider it an act of ethnic cleansing, however, in a controversial decision, the ICTY appeals court in the 2012 final verdict ruled that \"there had been no joint criminal enterprise, or conspiracy, to force out the Serbs from the Krajina region.\" Borjan's phone number was leaked among Croatian fans who sent him over 2,500 hateful messages during and after the game. His wife was also insulted during the game and targeted with hateful massages on social platforms just like him.\nThe incident was also preceded by Borjan's statement that he was \"born in Krajina\" and \"not Croatia\", while characterizing the historical Croatian region of Dalmatia as Serbian which Croatians considered a nationalist and irredentist claim. Republika Srpska Krajina was a separatist state created by Croatian Serbs in 1991 where ethnic cleansing of Croats was carried out.\nFIFA opened a disciplinary measure against Croatia over these incidents after the Canadian Soccer Association filed a complaint. On 7 December, the Croatian Football Federation was fined 50,000 Swiss francs due to violating article 16 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code.\nFIFA hit Croatia with another fine of 5,000 Swiss francs for the inappropriate behaviour (use of banners with inappropriate content) before the match against Morocco, played on 17 December.\nPitch invasions.\nA pitch invader, carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a shirt with the words “RESPECT FOR IRANIAN WOMAN” written on the back and “SAVE UKRAINE” written on the front, interrupted the Group H Portugal vs Uruguay match on 28 November.\nAnother person interrupted the Group D Tunisia vs France match on 30 November by running into the pitch carrying a Palestinian flag.\nJapan goal versus Spain.\nIn the Group E Japan vs Spain match, on 1 December, Japan midfielder Ao Tanaka scored a controversial goal (his team's second), the ball ending up in Unai Simón's net shortly after it seemed to have gone out of play. After a lengthy delay the goal was eventually awarded by VAR. The decision proved critical in both Japan's surprise topping of Group E and the elimination of Germany from the tournament, with \"Die Mannschaft\" finishing third despite securing a 4-2 victory over Costa Rica in the group's other game. An image was later released showing that the ball had not fully crossed the line, by the narrowest of margins. Qatari-owned network beIN Sports showed a virtual bird's eye view of the ball: the section of the ball which was in contact with the pitch was outside the field of play, but its curvature meant the side of the ball was still marginally over the line. Spain's coach Luis Enrique claimed that the image had been \"manipulated\". On December 3, FIFA released video and images to provide an official explanation to show that the VAR decision was correct.\nNetherlands vs Argentina quarter-final.\nSpanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz officiated the second quarter-final, held on 9 December, a game between the Netherlands and Argentina. Mateu Lahoz's decision-making throughout this game was called into question by many of those involved, as well as by neutral observers. BBC presenter Gary Lineker at one point during the game commented: \"13 yellow cards. This referee has always loved to be the centre of attention. Makes Mike Dean seem shy.\" Ultimately, Mateu Lahoz produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including two people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game. After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player Denzel Dumfries, however no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterwards puzzled. During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker Wout Weghorst scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC commentator Martin Keown remarked: \"I think the referee is losing the plot here.\"\nEarlier, and with Argentina giving up a two-goal lead to leave the score at 2–2, Argentina's Leandro Paredes fouled his opponent Nathan Aké. Paredes responded to the referee's whistle by angrily kicking the ball at the Dutch bench on which staff and players were seated. Enraged Dutch staff and players poured onto the pitch, followed by Argentine staff and player, sparking an on-pitch brawl featuring players and substitutes. Netherlands captain Virgil van Dijk was seen charging forward and knocking Paredes to the ground. Given the general confusion surrounding the game's total of yellow cards and several contradictions when various match reports are viewed, it is unclear how many players Mateu Lahoz booked in this one incident.\nAfter the game Lionel Messi asked FIFA to expel Mateu Lahoz. Messi also criticised the Netherlands manager: \"Louis van Gaal says they play good football, but what he did was put tall people and spam long balls\" and blamed Mateu Lahoz for causing the game to go on longer than it should have: \"The referee sent us into extra time\". The referee's decision not to show the yellow card to Messi for a deliberate handball also attracted comment, though Messi was eventually booked in the 10th minute of injury time at the end of the second half, at which point he would have been sent off with a red card if he had been booked for the earlier foul. Argentina's goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez described Mateu Lahoz as \"crazy, the worst referee of the tournament, he is arrogant. You say something to him and he talks back to you badly. I think since Spain went out [to Morocco in the Round of 16] he wanted us to go out as well\".\nBefore Argentine player Lautaro Martínez started walking to kick his penalty shot, several Dutch players started to surround him, in an attempt to psych him out, even though a player is supposed to go to kick the shot alone. He would later go on to score Argentina's decisive shot, that qualified them to the semifinals. Immediately following the penalty shootout victory, several Argentina players goaded the losing Netherlands players, e.g. Nicolás Otamendi raised his hands behind his ears, Leandro Paredes and Gonzalo Montiel gestured directly at them, while Alexis Mac Allister, Germán Pezzella and Ángel Di María screamed at their beaten opponents, action harshly shunned by some foreign commentators and claimed as misunderstood by some others. However, the next day, an overhead camera recorded the incident between Martínez and the chasing Dutch players.\nMessi, while giving a post-match interview, said to Wout Weghorst: \"What are you looking at, fool? Go away, go back there.\"\nPost-match incidents.\n\"No Surrender\" Kosovo flag.\nShortly after the Group G Brazil vs Serbia match on 24 November, a flag showing Kosovo as being part of Serbia with words \"\" () was seen hanging in Serbia's locker room. The flag was also displayed by fans during the game. The Football Association of Kosovo sued the Football Association of Serbia and urged FIFA to open an investigation. On 26 November 2022, FIFA opened proceedings against the Football Association of Serbia due on the basis of article 11 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and article 4 of the Regulations for the FIFA World Cup 2022. The Football Association of Serbia was subsequently fined 20,000 Swiss francs by FIFA on 7 December.\nMoroccan riots.\nFollowing the Group F Belgium vs Morocco match, in which Morocco unexpectedly defeated Belgium on 27 November, Moroccan fans began to riot in the Belgian cities of Brussels, Antwerp and Liege, and in the Dutch cities of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Amersfoort and The Hague. At least twelve people were detained and two police officers were injured. Riot police attempted to break up a group of 500 football supporters in Rotterdam while media reported unrest in Amsterdam and The Hague.\nFollowing the semifinal match between Morocco and France, clashes erupted between Moroccan and French fans in several French cities, with one 14-year-old boy being killed in Montpellier. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, 14 Moroccan fans were arrested in the city of Rotterdam amidst the unrest, while Dutch officials opted against public screenings of the game due to the previous unrest from the Morocco vs Belgium match.\nUruguayans after Ghana game.\nThe Group H Ghana vs Uruguay match on 2 December finished in a 2–0 victory for Uruguay; however, Uruguay failed to progress from the group. After the final whistle, several Uruguayan players confronted the referee and other FIFA officials over what they deemed as controversial decisions during the course of the game, and while walking down the tunnel towards the dressing rooms, Edinson Cavani pushed over the VAR monitor.\nAfter the tournament ended, FIFA banned \nFernando Muslera and José María Giménez for four international games each and was ordered to pay a fine of €20,000. Meanwhile, Edinson Cavani and Diego Godín must serve one international game bans each and must pay a fine of €15,000. All four players are also ordered to take part in a form of community service. The Uruguayan football federation was also fined €43,800 and will have to play one home fixture with a reduced capacity. The punishments received are reminiscent of the one that Luis Suárez received in 2014 after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini.\nSamuel Eto'o assault.\nFollowing the Group G Cameroon vs Brazil match on 2 December, Samuel Eto'o assaulted a man outside Stadium 974. A video circulated on social media of the former Cameroon international and Barcelona player, who was Cameroonian Football Federation president, attacking the man. Eto'o said himself, in a statement issued later that week, that it was a \"violent altercation\", that it was \"an unfortunate incident\" and that his victim was \"probably\" a fan of Algeria.\nArgentina–France final.\nAfter Argentina's win in the final, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani presented an Arab cloak, a \"bisht\", to Lionel Messi. In Qatar, using a bisht traditionally display a high status, used by royals. Some people criticised the gesture, saying it marred the moment when Messi lifted the World Cup; BBC host Gary Lineker said it was \"a shame they've covered his shirt\" during \"a magic moment\". However, fan and media reactions were mixed, with some commentators describing journalists who criticised the bisht presentation as salty.\nArgentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez, after winning the \"Golden glove\" trophy (which resembles a giant hand), placed it on his groin and pointed towards fans in front of the FIFA president and Qatari Emir, which some detractors saw as a vulgar gesture. \nTurkish celebrity Salt Bae was seen on the pitch, intruding to talk to the Argentine players, despite the clear discomfort of the players around him. He was also behaving inappropriately around the World Cup trophy and taking medals from the Argentines to bite into it."

        "text": "The 2014 Vuelta a España took place between 23 August and 14 September 2014 and was the 69th edition of the race. It featured eight mountain stages, five hill stages, five flat stages, and three time trials (one team and two individual), two of which appeared at the beginning and end of the race. Jerez de la Frontera, on the Spanish south coast, hosted the opening stage. The Vuelta then went counterclockwise, through the south-east and east of the country before crossing the north and finishing in Santiago de Compostela. This was the first time in 21 years that the race has finished outside Madrid.\nThe race was won for the third time by Spanish rider, Alberto Contador, of . \nContador went into the race uncertain of his form after crashing out of the Tour on the 10th stage, breaking his tibia. However, Contador found his form in the race earlier than expected, taking the red jersey on the 10th stage individual time trial and taking two key mountain stage wins on his way to victory. He won the race by 1' 10\" over runner-up, Chris Froome of . Like Contador, Froome also went into the race uncertain of his form after he crashed three times in two days during the Tour, leading to his withdrawal. However, Froome came to life during the third week, finishing second in three key mountain stages and taking time to move into second place overall. Spanish rider Alejandro Valverde of the completed the podium, finishing 40 seconds behind Froome and 1 minute and 50 seconds behind Contador. Valverde also took the sixth stage of the race going to La Zubia, the race's first mountain stage.\nIn the race's other classifications, John Degenkolb of won the green jersey for the points classification. Degenkolb took four stage wins, the most by any rider in the race. The blue polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification was taken by Spaniard Luis León Sánchez of . Aside from taking the red jersey, Contador also won the white jersey for the combination classification. He took the first place in the general classification, third place in the points classification and second place in the mountains classification. took the team classification for accumulating the lowest time from their three best cyclists.\nTeams.\nThe 18 UCI World Tour teams were automatically entitled to start the race; four wildcard teams were also invited.\n†: Invited UCI Pro Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nBefore the start of the race, defending champion, Chris Horner, 2014 Giro d'Italia champion Nairo Quintana, Joaquim Rodríguez and Alejandro Valverde were among the favourites for overall victory. After abandoning the Tour de France, Chris Froome and Alberto Contador announced they would compete in the Vuelta. Other possible contenders could emerge from Wilco Kelderman, Carlos Betancur, Fabio Aru, Thibaut Pinot, Ryder Hesjedal, Rigoberto Urán, Andrew Talansky and Dan Martin.\nThe day before the Vuelta began, Chris Horner was withdrawn from the race due to low levels of cortisol. This is because Lampre Merida () are part of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible (MPCC) which forbids cyclists from racing when cortisol concentrations drop below a specified threshold. On stage 11, Nairo Quintana withdrew from the race after crashing twice in two days.\nClassification leadership table.\nThere were four main classifications contested in the 2014 Vuelta a España, with the most important being the general classification. The general classification was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the red jersey; the winner of this classification was considered the winner of the Vuelta. In 2014, there were time bonuses given on mass-start stages; ten seconds were awarded to the stage winner, with six for second and four for third.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awards a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists get points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and is identified with a green jersey. There was also a mountains classification. The organisation categorised some climbs as either Categoria Especial, first, second or third category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reach the top of these climbs, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a blue polka dot jersey.\nThe fourth individual classification was the combination classification, marked by the white jersey. This classification is calculated by adding the numeral ranks of each cyclist in the general, points and mountains classifications – a rider must have a score in all classifications possible to qualify for the combination classification – with the lowest cumulative total signifying the winner of this competition.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team is the team with the lowest total time. For the combativity award, a jury gives points after each stage to the cyclists they considered most combative. The cyclist with the most votes in all stages leads the classification. For the daily combative winner, the rider in question donned a dossard with a red background, on the following stage."

        "text": "The 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the seventh ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament, with the matches played in the Oman and United Arab Emirates, on behalf of India, from 17 October to 14 November 2021. The West Indies were the defending champions, but were eventually eliminated in the Super 12 stage.\nOriginally, the event was scheduled to be held in Australia from 18 October to 15 November 2020, but in July 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that this tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India would host the 2021 tournament as planned, with Australia being named as the host for the succeeding 2022 tournament. However, in June 2021, the ICC announced that the tournament had been moved to the United Arab Emirates due to growing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic situation in India, and a possible third wave of the pandemic in the country due to the fears of Delta variant. The tournament began on 17 October 2021, with the tournament's final taking place on 14 November 2021. The preliminary rounds of the tournament were played in the Oman and UAE.\nNew Zealand became the first team to reach the final, after they beat England by five wickets in the semi-finals. It was the first time that New Zealand had qualified for a T20 World Cup final. They were joined in the final by Australia, who beat Pakistan by five wickets in the second semi-final. It was the second time that Australia had qualified for the final of the T20 World Cup, after reaching the final of the 2010 tournament. In the final, Australia beat New Zealand by eight wickets to win their first T20 World Cup. Mitchell Marsh was named the Player of the Match, with David Warner being named the Player of the Tournament.\nBackground.\nIn April 2020, the ICC confirmed that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was still planned to go ahead as scheduled. However, the following month a senior ICC official said that it would be \"too big a risk\" to host the tournament in 2020, The ICC also stated that reports of postponing the tournament were inaccurate, with multiple contingency plans being looked at. A decision on the tournament was originally deferred until the ICC's meeting on 10 June 2020, with a further announcement scheduled to be made in July 2020. In June 2020, Earl Eddings, the chairman of Cricket Australia, said that it was \"unlikely\" and \"unrealistic\" that the tournament would take place in Australia as scheduled. Eddings also suggested that Australia could host the event in October 2021, and India stage the tournament a year later in 2022. The ICC also considered moving the tournament to be played around the next Women's ODI World Cup, which was originally scheduled to take place in New Zealand for February 2021.\nA month before the official postponement, Australian federal tourism minister Simon Birmingham announced that the Australian government expected that the country's borders would be closed to international travel until 2021. The ICC also confirmed that either Australia or India, the hosts for the tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2020 and 2021 respectively, would host this tournament. In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India are expected to host the 2021 tournament, with Australia expected to the 2022 tournament. In the same month, the ICC confirmed that Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates were being considered as back-up venues for the tournament. In April 2021, the ICC's CEO Geoff Allardice confirmed that back-up plans were still in place if India were unable to host the tournament due to the pandemic. Later the same month, Dhiraj Malhotra of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that the UAE would be used as a contingency, if the pandemic in India continued to get worse. The BCCI were also in talks with Oman as a potential co-host of the tournament. On 1 June 2021, the ICC gave the BCCI the deadline of 28 June 2021 to make its decision on where the tournament would be played. Regardless of the actual location of the tournament, the ICC also confirmed that the BCCI would remain as the hosts of the competition. Later, the ICC confirmed that the tournament had been moved to the UAE and Oman. It was the first time for both the UAE and Oman to be hosting a global ICC event, and also the first occasion that a cricket World Cup was being held entirely outside of the Test-playing nations.\nLess than two weeks before the start of the tournament, Oman was impacted by Cyclone Shaheen which passed only a few miles north of the tournament venue in Al-Amerat. Pankaj Khimji, chairman of Oman Cricket, stated that \"we were so close to being virtually wiped out [...] had this had happened over here in this area, I'd have said goodbye to the World Cup\".\nTeams and qualification.\nAs of 31 December 2018, the top nine ranked ICC Full Members, alongside hosts India, qualified directly for the 2021 tournament. Of those ten teams, the top eight ranked sides qualified for the Super 12s stage of the tournament. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh did not qualify for the Super 12s, instead being placed in the group stage of the competition. They were joined by the six teams who had qualified for the tournament via the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier. Of the teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings, the United Arab Emirates and Nepal could only qualify through regional competitions. The top four teams from the group stage advanced to the Super 12s.\nPapua New Guinea were the first team to secure their position via the Qualifier, after they won Group A of the tournament, finishing above the Netherlands on net run rate. It was the first time that Papua New Guinea had qualified for a World Cup in any format. Ireland became the second team to qualify via this route after they won Group B, also on net run rate.\nIn the first match in the playoffs, the Netherlands qualified for the T20 World Cup when they beat the United Arab Emirates by eight wickets, after the UAE only scored 80 runs in their innings. The second qualifier match saw Namibia advance to their first T20 World Cup after beating Oman by 54 runs. Scotland beat tournament hosts the United Arab Emirates in the third qualifier by 90 runs to secure their place in the T20 World Cup. Oman became the final team to qualify for the T20 World Cup, when they beat Hong Kong by 12 runs in the last playoff match.\nIn August 2021, concerns and doubts were raised over the participation of Afghanistan cricket team in the tournament ever since Afghanistan was brought under the control of the Taliban. Afghanistan's team media manager Hikmat Hassan confirmed that Afghanistan would play in the T20 World Cup, despite the political turmoil in the country. On 6 October 2021, the Afghanistan team left Kabul, travelling to Doha, Qatar, for a training camp before the start of the tournament.\nMatch officials.\nOn 7 October 2021, the ICC named the match referees and the on-field umpires for the tournament. For the Super 12 match between India and New Zealand, umpire Michael Gough was replaced by Marais Erasmus after Gough was suspended for six days for breaching the tournament's bio-secure bubble. On 3 November 2021, the ICC confirmed that Gough would not officiate in any further matches in the tournament. On 9 November 2021, the match officials were confirmed for the semi-final matches, with the officials for the final being confirmed on 12 November 2021.\nMatch referees\nUmpires\nSquads.\nEach team selected a squad of 15 players before 10 October 2021. Each team was also able to select up to seven additional players, if needed, with regards to COVID-19. On 10 August 2021, New Zealand were the first team to announce their squad for the tournament. All the teams announced their preliminary squads by 12 September 2021.\nSchedule and broadcasting.\nWith a total of 45 matches, the T20 World Cup was composed of two rounds. Round 1 had twelve matches played between eight teams (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Ireland, Netherlands, Scotland, Namibia, Oman and Papua New Guinea), with the top four teams progressing to the Super 12s. The Super 12s consisted of 30 matches between the four teams from Round 1 and the top eight ranked T20I teams. Originally, if Sri Lanka or Bangladesh qualified from their first round groups, they would have retained their respective seedings of A1 or B1 for the Super 12s. However, the ICC later changed this rule, after Scotland topped Group B and progressed as B1. Those teams were then split into two groups of six each. This was then followed by the two semi-finals and then the final. On 16 July 2021, the ICC confirmed the groups for the tournament, which were decided on the rankings of the teams as of 20 March 2021. On 17 August 2021, the ICC confirmed the final fixtures for the tournament including the first round and super 12 matches.\nThe ICC named all of the official broadcasters for the tournament on its website, including details on television coverage, digital content for in-match clips and highlights, and audio listings. The official anthem of the tournament was released on 14 October 2021, by Sony Music India.\nVenues.\nOn 17 April 2021, the BCCI proposed the name of the cities which are scheduled to be hosting the matches. Bangalore, Chennai, Dharamshala, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and New Delhi were the venues along with Ahmedabad, hosting the final of the event.

        "text": "Brian Keith Cole (September 28, 1978 – March 31, 2001) was a professional baseball outfielder. Cole played in Minor League Baseball for the New York Mets organization from 1998 to 2000, becoming one of the top prospects in baseball. He died in a car accident at the age of 22 in 2001.\nCareer.\nCole was born in Meridian, Mississippi and attended Meridian High School. He played both baseball and American football, scoring a school record 22 touchdowns in his senior year. He received numerous offers to play college football from Division I schools, but decided to pursue a career in baseball.\nThe Detroit Tigers selected Cole in the 36th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball Draft, but he declined the Tigers $5,000 offer and instead attended Navarro College. In his lone season at Navarro he hit .524 with 27 home runs, 82 runs batted in (RBI), 95 runs scored and 49 stolen bases in 60 games. For his play, he was named \"Baseball America's\" Junior College Player of the Year.\nCole was then drafted by the New York Mets in the 18th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft and chose to sign. He made his professional debut that season for the Kingsport Mets. After 56 games with Kingsport, he was promoted to the Pittsfield Mets, where he played in two games. Overall, he hit .298/.315/.487 with five home runs, 36 RBI and 16 stolen bases. Cole played the 1999 season with the Capital City Bombers. In 125 games, he hit .316/.362/.522 with 18 home runs, 71 RBI and 50 stolen bases. Prior to the 2000 season, Baseball America ranked him as the Mets fourth best prospect. He started the season with the St. Lucie Mets. After hitting .312/.356/.528 with 15 home runs and 54 stolen bases in 91 games, he was promoted to the Double-A Binghamton Mets. He struggled early on, hitting only .136 in his first 59 bats, but rebounded to hit .350 over his next 117 at-bats. Overall, he hit .301/.347/.494 with 19 home runs, 86 RBI and 69 stolen bases. For his play, he was named the Mets Minor League Player of the Year and was honored in a pregame ceremony at Shea Stadium. After the season, he played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League.\nPrior to the 2001 season, Cole was ranked by Baseball America as the Mets third best prospect and the 64th best in all of baseball. He was invited to spring training for the first time that season, where he impressed coaches, including Mookie Wilson.\nDeath.\nOn March 31, 2001, Cole was driving to his parents' home in Meridian from Mets spring training in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when he lost control of his vehicle, causing it to roll numerous times and flip over. He had been trying to reenter the road after another car had entered his lane causing him to enter the median. Cole, who was not wearing his seat belt, was ejected from the car causing major injuries to his skull, brain, lungs and several other organs. He was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead a few hours later. His cousin was also in the car, but was wearing a seat belt and avoided serious injury.\nIn 2010, his family won $131 million in a lawsuit filed against the Ford Motor Company, claiming that the Ford Explorer (the car Cole was driving) is \"defective and unreasonably dangerous for the uses for which it was marketed because the vehicle has an unreasonable tendency to roll when used as Ford marketed it to be used [as a station wagon replacement], and that the vehicle is also defective and unreasonably dangerous from an occupant protection or 'crashworthiness' standpoint because the safety belt failed to remain locked and permitted Brian to be thrown from the car and killed.\"\nTeammate and friend Pat Strange named his son Brian Cole Strange, in honor of Cole."

In individual foil, Arianna Errigo win her fourth World Cup series in women's foil, the third time in a row. Three other Italians, Elisa Di Francisca, Martina Batini and Valentina Vezzali, follow her in the individual rankings. The four of them form the so-called “Dream Team”, which won every World Cup tournament of the season, the continental and the world championships. Olha Kharlan maintained her domination over women's sabre, winning the continental championship, the World Championships and the World Cup for the second time in a row. In épée veteran Emese Szász won her second series after her 2009–10 crown.\nThe men's events were dominated by Asian countries. Korea's Gu Bon-gil was the first non-European to win the men's sabre series, pipping to the post his fellow countryman Kim Jung-hwan by only six points. Russia maintained however a tenuous lead in men's team sabre. In foil China's Ma Jianfei broke Andrea Cassarà's string of victories. In épée 19-year-old Park Sang-young, who ranked third, proved the revelation of the season. 2013–14 saw France's return to form, with veteran Ulrich Robeiri winning the men's épée series, young Enzo Lefort placing second in foil, and France taking the lead in team men's épée and foil.\nThe season was also marked by Ukraine's boycott of the men's and women's Moscow World Cup in protest at the death of a Ukrainian soldier in the Simferopol incident."

        "text": "Dean Bradley Hall (born 2 September 1977) is a South African former professional rugby player. He played on the wing. He played the majority of his career for the Johannesburg based teams, the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup and Vodacom Cup and the Cats in Super Rugby. Later in his career he moved to Durban and played for the in the Currie Cup, the Natal Wildebeest in the Vodacom Cup and the Sharks in Super Rugby. He was also capped thirteen times for the Springboks and scored four test tries. His career was hampered with injury and he never reached his full potential. He was quite large for a wing, but in the wake of Jonah Lomu's sensation at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, it was hoped that Dean Hall would become the Springbok's massive wing.\nEarly life and youth career.\nDean Hall was born in Springs, in the Gauteng Province of South Africa on 2 September 1977. He went to Selection Park Primary School and then to Springs Boys High School. He played for Pirates Rugby Club in Gauteng. In 1996 Hall was selected for the South Africa U/23 team. He got selected for the under 23's again in 2000 when they competed in the African Rugby Championships. In 1997 and 1998 he played for the Golden Lions U/21 team, even though he got selected for the Golden Lions' senior team to play in the Currie Cup as early as 1997.\nSenior career.\n1997 to 1998.\nIn 1997 while still eligible for age-group rugby, Hall was selected in the Golden Lions senior squad for the Currie Cup. He was not selected in the senior team in 1998, but continued to play for the Golden Lions U/21 team.\n1999 to 2000.\nHall started playing Currie Cup rugby in 1999 and became a regular starter for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup as well as the Vodacom Cup. In 2000 he was selected for the Cat's Super Rugby squad. He went on to play 26 Super Rugby games for the Cats. He scored 20 tries for the Golden Lions in the Currie Cup season, which is fifth on the list of most tries scored in a season by a Lions player. In 1999, while Hall was part of the Golden Lions' team, they won the Currie Cup. Hall came on as a replacement during the final, which the Lions won 33-9 against the Sharks in Durban.\n2001.\nIn 2001 Hall continued to play Super Rugby for the Cats and gained instant fame when he flattened Highlanders back Iliesa Tanivula on his way to the tryline. This good form resulted in him being selected for the Springboks, ahead of veteran winger Pieter Rossouw. Jake White who was the Springboks' assistant coach at the time mentioned that Hall selection was to increase the skill level of the team in general and was viewed as a powerful statement of intent of Bok coach Harry Viljoen's plan to utilise the full width of the pitch in his game plan. On 16 June 2001, Hall made his test debut against at his home ground, Ellis Park in Johannesburg. The Springboks lost the game 23-32. Hall was again in the team the following week at Kings Park in Durban when the Springboks changed it around and ran out winners, 20-15.\nHall played in all South Africa's Tri Nations games of 2001 Tri Nations Series, but failed to score a try. He was also selected for the Springboks' end of year tour to France, Italy, England and the USA. Hall scored his first test try in a 54-26 victory over at the Luigi Ferraris Stadium in Genoa on 17 November 2001. His other try of the tour came against the at the Robertson Stadium in Houston, Texas.\n2002 to 2004.\nFrom 2002 to 2003 Hall continued to play Currie Cup rugby for the Golden Lions and Super Rugby for the Cats. Hall fell out of favour with the Springbok coaches in early 2002 and Breyton Paulse was preferred at left wing with Stefan Terblanche at right wing in the mid-year tests against and . He was selected to play in the South Africa A team which faced Argentina on 26 June 2002 in Witbank. A game South Africa A won 42-36, thanks to two tries scored by Hall. One of these tries came three minutes after the final hooter, to deny the Argentinians victory. Argentina led 36-35 before Hall's try. Paulse, coming back from injury, struggled with his form in the tests against Wales and Argentina and was replaced by Hall for the test against at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on 6 July 2002. Hall scored 2 tries in a 60-18 victory for the Springboks. He also played in the first Tri Nations game of the season, against the All Blacks at Westpac Stadium in Wellington. South Africa lost this game 41-20 with Hall picking up an injury. He was replaced by Paulse the following game against in Brisbane. Hall played both games during the home leg of the tournament against Australia and New Zealand. The game against Australia on 17 August 2002 at Ellis Park turned out to be his last game in a Springbok jersey. Although he was part of the Golden Lions' Currie Cup squad during 2002, he was injured before the Currie Cup semi final and subsequently did not go on tour with the Springboks for their 2002 end of year tour.\nIn 2003 he was recovering from a serious knee injury. He formed part of the Cats' Super Rugby squad, but injuries kept him on the sidelines for the majority of his remaining career. He never fully recovered from this serious knee injury and was never again selected for the Springboks. According to one doctor who examined him in 2002, his knee cartilage had turned into that of a pensioners.\n2005 to 2007.\nIn a bid to revive his career, Hall moved to the . He was included in the Sharks' Super Rugby squad for 2005, but failed to make the team for any Super Rugby match. In 2006 he played Vodacom Cup rugby for the Natal Wildebeest and was part of the Currie Cup squad. In total he played seven games for the Durban-based team, including a Sharks Invitational XV who faced the Western Force in Pietermaritzburg in June 2006 in preparation for the Currie Cup.\nAt the start of the 2006/2007 Japanese season, Hall joined the Ricoh Black Rams in Japan. Hall went on to earn 12 caps for Ricoh during the season.\nAfter retirement.\nHall has remained involved with rugby, being involved in rugby development in previously disadvantaged communities. In 2011 he was also involved in an Advanced Players and Coaches course at St Stithians College in Bryanston, hosted by The Investec International Rugby Academy, where young rugby players aged 16 to 18 spent time with top coaches and players.\nHe currently runs his own business Solo chemicals in Johannesburg"

Two of the semifinalists from 1932 returned: Louis Chaillot of France, who had won the silver medal, and Dunc Gray of Australia, who had not started the bronze medal race but had won the track time trial event. The favorites in 1936, however, were Toni Merkens of Germany and Arie van Vliet of the Netherlands, the winner and runner-up in the 1935 World Championship.\nThe Republic of China, New Zealand, Norway, and Peru each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its eighth appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis track cycling event consisted of numerous rounds. Each race involved the riders starting simultaneously and next to each other, from a standing start. Because the early part of races tend to be slow-paced and highly tactical, only the time for the last 200 metres of the one-kilometre race is recorded.\nThe competition involved five main rounds and a repechage. In the first round, there were ten heats of two cyclists each. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the second round, while the loser competed in a repechage. The repechage featured four heats, two of three cyclists and two of two cyclists. The last-placed finisher in each repechage was eliminated, while the winner advanced along with the second-place rider in the three-man heats. Round 2 and the quarterfinals were each head-to-head, single-elimination races: eight heats in round 2 and four heats in the quarterfinals. The semifinals were also head-to-head competitions, with the winners advancing to the final and the losers going to a bronze medal match.\nThe 1932 competition had introduced the best-of-three format for the final (and only the final); the 1936 version expanded that best-of-three format to the bronze medal match as well. The two cyclists in each match competed up to three times, with the first cyclist to win two races being the winner.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new Olympic record was set during the competition.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe winner in each heat qualified for the second round. The loser was relegated to the repechage for another chance at qualifying.\nRepechage.\nThe last place finisher in each repechage was eliminated. The winner of each heat advanced to the second round, along with the second place finisher in heats where there were three cyclists.\nRound 2.\nThe winner of each heat advanced; the loser was eliminated.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winners qualified for the semifinals; the losers were eliminated.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinal winners advanced to the gold medal final, while the losers competed in the bronze medal final.\nFinals.\nBoth the gold and bronze medal finals were conducted as best-of-three competitions. In each case, the same cyclist won both of the first two races, making a third race unnecessary. Merkens was fined for \"deviating from the racing lane\" in the first race of the final, though was allowed to finish the competition."

Jordan Spieth won his first U.S. Open and consecutive major titles, one stroke ahead of runners-up Dustin Johnson and Louis Oosthuizen. This was the first U.S. Open televised by Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports, launching a 12-year contract with the United States Golf Association.\nSpieth, age 21, became the youngest U.S. Open champion in 92 years, since Bobby Jones in 1923. The reigning Masters champion, Spieth became the youngest to win the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year, passing Tiger Woods, who won both in 2002 at age 26. Others to win the first two majors of the year were Craig Wood (1941), Ben Hogan (1951, 1953), Arnold Palmer (1960), and Jack Nicklaus (1972).\nThis was the first U.S. Open played in the Pacific Northwest and the third major played in the state of Washington, which hosted the PGA Championship in 1944 and 1998.\nVenue.\nOwned by Pierce County, the Chambers Bay course opened for play only eight years earlier in June 2007.\nCourse layout.\nThe course was laid out differently each day, with course totals ranging from on Sunday, to on Friday. Holes 1 and 18 were played as either par-4 or par-5: the first was a par-4 and the 18th was a par-5 for three of the rounds, switching only for the second round on Friday, and the course was par 70 for each round.\n&lt;br&gt;\n^ &lt;br&gt;\nCriticism of the course.\nChambers Bay was subject to criticism for its bumpy greens, unfair course design, and poor accessibility for spectators. Former U.S. Open champion Gary Player called it \"the worst golf course I might've ever seen in the 63 years as a professional golfer\", and Henrik Stenson said that the greens were like \"putting on broccoli\".\nField.\nAbout half the field consisted of players who are exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open.

Johnson recorded four birdies on his back-nine and did not make a bogey until the par-3 9th, his 18th hole of the round. Stenson, meanwhile, birdied four of his last five holes to tie Johnson for the lead. Jordan Spieth, the reigning Masters champion, was three strokes back after a 68. Three-time champion Tiger Woods opened with a round of 80 (+10), his worst score ever at the U.S. Open.

First round co-leader Dustin Johnson got as low as 7-under before bogeys on three of his last five holes dropped him to a stroke behind the leaders. Jason Day was just two shots off the lead playing the 9th hole, his 18th of the round, when he collapsed from vertigo. After being treated by medical personnel for several minutes, Day was able to finish the hole and made bogey, dropping to three behind and a tie for 9th place. Tiger Woods missed the cut with a two-round score of 16-over-par, his worst 36-hole score in a major.\nA bogey on the final hole by Nick Hardy, a freshman from the University of Illinois, moved the cut line to +5. Fifteen additional players earned entry into the third round, including Ángel Cabrera, Sergio García, Colin Montgomerie, Webb Simpson, and Jimmy Walker. \nThe 1st hole was set as a 593-yard par-5 and the 18th hole as 514-yard par-4, with the total yardage at 7,695.

In the final pairing with Jason Day at 3 pm PDT, Dustin Johnson recorded two birdies on the front nine to take sole possession of the lead, then lost it with bogeys on three out of four holes to begin the back nine. In the penultimate pairing, Jordan Spieth and Branden Grace both birdied the par-4 12th to tie, but Grace fell from contention on the 16th after his drive went out of bounds and he made double bogey. Spieth holed a birdie putt at the 16th to open up a three-stroke lead, but then three-putted for double bogey on the par-3 17th to fall into a tie with Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen began the round three shots off the lead and quickly dropped further behind with three consecutive bogeys on the front-nine. Beginning at the 12th, however, Oosthuizen birdied six out of his last seven holes to tie Spieth. At the par-5 18th, Spieth hit the green in two and proceeded to two-putt for birdie. Johnson recovered from his bogey streak with a birdie at the 17th, then also found the 18th green in two. Faced with a eagle putt to win the championship, Johnson's attempt rolled three feet (0.9 m) past the hole, then missed his birdie putt to tie. Expecting a Monday playoff, Spieth suddenly gained a one-stroke victory for his second consecutive major title.\nWith the win, Spieth became the sixth to win both the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year and the first since Tiger Woods in 2002. He also became the first to win two majors before the age of 22 since Gene Sarazen in 1922, and the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923. After opening with a round of 77 (+7), Oosthuizen shot 199 over his last three rounds, tying the U.S. Open record for lowest 54-hole score. His score of 29 on the back-nine also tied a tournament record.\nThe first hole was set as a par-4 at and the 18th hole as a par-5 at , with the total at . The scoring average for the field was 71.29 (+1.29) and 22 players had under-par rounds. Adam Scott had the low round of the championship, a 6-under-par 64 to tie for fourth.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nMedia.\nThis was the first U.S. Open televised by Fox Sports, which began a 12-year contract to televise the championship and other USGA events.

The Americans were on the same side of the draw, because Rojas lost to Fernando Rios of Ecuador in a great match that went tie-breaker in the round robin part of the competition. Sadly for Rios, his victory didn't lead to a great position in the elimination draw, as he had to play Gutierrez in the second round, as Gutierrez missed one of his round robin matches, which put him fourth in his group.

Indeed, Amaya had match points on Rajsich in both games two and three, but couldn't convert them, as Rajsich won 12–15, 15–14, 11–10.

        "title": "2011 Super Rugby final",
        "text": "The 2011 Super Rugby Final, was played between the Queensland Reds from Australia and the Crusaders from New Zealand on 9 July 2011. It was the 16th final in the Super Rugby competition's history and the first under the new 15-team format. The Reds had qualified in first place after the regular competition rounds, while the Crusaders qualified in third. The Reds went straight to the semi-final, where they beat New Zealand team the Blues. The Crusaders hosted a qualifying final in Nelson beating the Sharks, and then travelled to Cape Town and beat the Stormers in the other semi-final. As the Reds had qualified higher, the final was hosted in Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium.\nThe Crusaders went into the final as favourites, despite playing away from home and having travelled across many time-zones to reach the final. This was partly due to their impressive record, reaching ten finals in fourteen years and winning the Super Rugby championship seven times. The match was scoreless in the opening half hour with strong defence shown by both sides, but a try to Dan Carter gave the Crusaders an early lead. The Reds stayed in the game through two penalty kicks from Quade Cooper and went into half-time trailing by 6–7.\nThe match opened up late in the game as fatigue took its toll on the defence from both sides. Carter kicked a penalty goal in the 49th minute to take the Crusaders to a four-point lead. The Reds hit back through a try to winger Digby Ioane. The conversion from Cooper took it to 13–10 before Carter tied the score with a 45-metre penalty kick in the 56th minute. With the score locked at 13–13, Reds scrum-half Will Genia broke the deadlock with a solo 30 metre run for the standout try of the match. The Reds held on to claim the title, scoring two tries to the Crusaders' one, with the final score at 18–13.\nRoad to the Final.\nThe 2011 Super Rugby championship involved fifteen teams, five each from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The 2011 season was the 16th year of the competition, and the first in the new 15 team format (12 teams competed between 1996 and 2005, before increasing to 14 between 2006 and 2010). The 2011 competition began on 18 February with the regular competition rounds consisting of 120 matches over twenty one weeks. Each team played teams from their own country twice (home and away) and four teams from each of the other two countries once (two at home and two away). The top six teams would advance to the finals.\nThe Reds won the Australian conference and topped the overall standings, with just three losses during the season (to the Brumbies, Waratahs, and Hurricanes). The Crusaders finished top of the New Zealand conference, an outstanding performance after the effect of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake on the team, including the cancellation of their match with the Hurricanes and the loss of their home ground for the season. The Blues, Waratahs and Sharks filled the remaining three places as the next top finishers.\nThe Blues hosted the Waratahs in Auckland in the first qualifying final, while the Sharks travelled to Nelson to play the Crusaders. There were two tries apiece scored by the Blues and Waratahs in the first qualifier, but the Blues prevailed with Lachie Munro kicking eleven points off the tee in their 26–13 victory. In Nelson, the Crusaders beat the Sharks in the second qualifier, scoring four tries to one to win 36–8.\nFor the semi-finals, the Blues travelled to Brisbane to play the Reds and the Crusaders flew to Cape Town to play the Stormers. Both games were won by a clear margin. Rod Davies scored a hat-trick of tries in Brisbane for the Reds to beat the Blues by four tries to one with a final score of 30–13. In the second semi-final at Cape Town, the Stormers and Crusaders scored two tries each, but All Black five eighth Dan Carter scored 17 points to secure the away victory for the Crusaders by 29–10.\nFinal match.\nWhen the same teams played at Suncorp Stadium a month before the final, the Reds had carried off a late 17–16 victory against the Crusaders. Despite being away from home and having travelled over 100,000 kilometres during the year, the Crusaders still went into the match as favourites at odds of 8/15. This was the 10th final for the Crusaders in 14 years and they had won the Super Rugby championship seven times.\nThe Queensland Reds had won Super Rugby trophies twice before in the amateur era of the Super 10, beating Natal 21–10 in 1994 and Transvaal 30-16 in 1995.\nFirst half.\nThe Crusaders held the territory and possession advantage early, but Dan Carter pushed a penalty attempt wide at the 15 minute mark. The Reds then wasted two opportunities from attacking positions. After a scoreless opening half hour, Quade Cooper kicked penalty goal in the 32nd minute. The Crusaders replied through a try to Carter who ran hard at the Reds' defenders, kicking the ball ahead as he reached them on the quarter-line, before gliding through to regather and score with 34 minutes gone. He converted his own try to take a four-point lead.\nThe combative defence of the Crusaders was effective in pressuring Cooper and Genia, who had controlled the play in the Red's win against the Blues in the previous week's semifinal, and largely kept them in check during the opening half. The Crusaders also made errors, though, in particular three not-straight line-out throws from hooker Corey Flynn which gave possession to the Reds. Cooper reduced the deficit with 38 minutes elapsed by kicking another penalty goal following his entanglement with Brad Thorn’s outstretched leg, and the score at half time was 6–7 to the Crusaders.\nSecond half.\nCooper started things brightly for the Reds after the break, stepping through the line with Rod Davies in support and getting a pass away but it fooled everyone and went to ground. The match opened up as fatigue took its toll on the defence from both sides. Richie McCaw thwarted a midfield break by Ben Tapaui with a critical ankle tap. In the 45th minute, a knock on by Digby Ioane gave a scrum to the Crusaders 20 metres out. Brad Thorn then barged over the line but no try was awarded as the TMO couldn't see a grounding. This was a missed opportunity for the Crusaders as Thorn had 4 unmarked Crusaders to his left. From a scrum penalty a minute later, however, Carter kicked a penalty goal from 22 metres out to put the Crusaders ahead by four.\nThe Reds retook the lead through a try to Ioane with some big stepping around Sonny Bill Williams and outright pace. Cooper converted it to make the score 13–10, but Carter levelled it up with a 45-metre penalty kick shortly after. With the score at 13 all, Rob Simmons seemed to have broken the deadlock for the Reds with an intercept and long run in to the try-line before the referee ruled that he had knocked on.\nWill Genia proved to be the game breaker. The Reds gained a turnover 60 metres out from the Crusaders’ tryline. Anthony Faingaa passed the ball to Genia who accelerated through a gap near the ruck. The Crusaders replacement scrumhalf Kahn Fotuali’i attempted an ankle tap instead of a diving tackle, and missed. Genia was over the forty-metre line. Having Cooper to his left in support held off Sonny Bill Williams and Zac Guildford, leaving Sean Maitland to defend against Genia. With a fend on Maitland, Genia's momentum carried him over the line to claim the standout try of the match. The Reds were in front with 10 minutes remaining. They held on to win their first major title since the game turned professional in the mid 1990s. The attendance of 52,113 was a then record crowd for Super Rugby in Australia. The Reds scored two tries to the Crusaders' one, with the final score at 18–13. Will Genia was named as the Man of the Match."

        "title": "Network Science Based Basketball Analytics",
        "text": "Network Science based basketball analytics comprise a various recent attempts to apply the perspective of networks to the analysis of basketball.\nOverview.\nTraditional basketball statistics analyze individuals independently of their teammates or competitors and traditional player positions are determined by individual attributes. In contrast, these network based analytics are obtained by constructing a team or league level player networks, where individual players are nodes connected by the ball movement or by some measure of similarity. Then, the metrics are obtained by calculating network properties, such as degree, density, centrality, clustering, distance etc. This approach enriches the analysis of basketball with new individual and team level statistics and offers a new way of assigning position to a player.\nTeam level statistics.\nThe biggest contribution to the team level metrics came from Arizona State University researchers led by Jennifer H. Fewell. Using 2010 NBA first round playoff data, they constructed the networks for each team using players as nodes and ball movement between them as links. They distinguish the trade-off between not necessarily mutually exclusive division of labor and team's unpredictability that are measured by Uphill downhill flux and Team entropy respectively.\nTeam entropy - A measure of unpredictability and variation in teams offense, higher entropy meaning more variation. It is calculated as aggregated individual Shannon entropies, where unpredictability is measured as uncertainty of the ball movement between any two nodes.\nUphill downhill flux - Measures the division of labor, or the expertise in moving the ball to the player with the best shooting percentage. According to Fewell et al. It can be interpreted as an average change in potential shooting percentage per pass. The metric is calculated as a sum of the differences between the shooting percentages of the nodes at the ends of each edge\nwhere p \"ij\" is the probability of the link between players i and j, x\"i\" and x\"j\" are their shooting percentages.\nOther measures include:\nTeam clustering coefficient - A direct application of a clustering coefficient. It measures how interconnected are the players, whether the ball moves via one node or whether in many ways between all the players.\nTeam degree centrality - Similarly to the previous metric, it measures if there is one dominant player in the team. It is calculated by the formula\nformula_2\nwhere deg(v) is the degree of the node v, deg(v*) is the highest degree node, V is the number of nodes.\nCombined low clustering and high degree centrality mean that the defense can put double team on the dominant player, since without him ball team experiences problems in moving the ball.\nAverage path length - Number of passes per play.\nPath flow rate - Number of passes per unit time. It measures how quickly the team moves the ball.\nDeviation from maximum operating potential - Using players as the nodes and ball movement and links and true shooting percentage as efficiency, analogy can by made to the traffic network. Each individual is assumed to have a skill curve f(x), which is declining in the number shots taken. Individual maximization of the efficiency yield \nformula_3 \nwhereas to maximum efficiency is achieved by solving\nformula_4, where formula_5\nThe difference between these two constitute the teams deviation from the maximum potential.\nIndividual statistics.\nSuccess/Failure Ratio - The number of times the player (node) was involved in the successful play divided by the number of times the player was involved in the unsuccessful play. The metric is obtained from the team play by play network.\nUnder/over performance - The metric is calculated by mapping the bipartite player network. Players are connected if they were a part of one team. The links are weighted by how successful was the team, where the players played together. Then node centrality measures are compared to the reference centrality distributions for each node obtained by bootstrap - based randomization procedures and p - values are calculated. For example p - value of player i is given by :\nformula_6, where πi* is the reference centrality score, πi0 is the calculated centrality score, J - number of iterations. High p - values indicate under-performance, low - over-performance.\nUnder - utilization - A player is under-utilized by the time if he has a low degree centrality, but is over-performing\nPlayer positions.\nNew basketball positions were classified by Stanford University student Muthu Alagappan, who while working for the data visualization company Ayasdi, mapped the network of one season NBA players linking them by the similarity of their statistics. Then, based on node clusters players were grouped into 13 positions.\nOffensive Ball-Handler\nPlayer that specializes in scoring and ball handling, but has low averages of steals and blocks.\nDefensive Ball-Handler\nPlayer who specialized in assisting and stealing the ball, but is average in scoring and shooting.\nCombo Ball-Handler\nPlayer who are above average in both offense and defense, but doesn't excel in any.\nShooting Ball-Handler\nPlayer that is above average in shot attempts and points scored per game.\nRole-Playing Ball-Handler\nThose who play few minutes and don't have large impact on the team.\n3-Point Rebounder\nA big man and a ball handler with above average rebounds and three point shots attempted and made.\nScoring Rebounder\nPlayer with high scoring and rebound averages.\nPaint Protector\nThose valued for blocking and rebounding, but with low average points scored.\nScoring Paint Protector\nPlayers that at both good and offense and defense in the paint.\nNBA 1st-Team\nThose with above averages in most of the statistical categories.\nNBA 2nd-Team\nSimilar, but a bit worse than NBA 1st-Team players.\nRole Player\nSimilar, but worse than NBA 2nd-Team players.\nOne-of-a-Kind\nOnes that are so good and exceptional that could not be categorized.\nSee also.\nNetwork science\nGraph theory\nMuthu Alagappan\nAPBRmetrics"

He was recognized for his outstanding play during the 2010–11 season when he was named Michigan's Mr. Hockey as the Top High School Player in Michigan, becoming only the second junior to win the award (Justin Abdelkader won the award as a junior in 2004).\nWith the 2011–12 season, Johnson joined the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League. Playing three seasons of major junior hockey with the Spitfires, Johnson scored 66 goals and 62 assists for 128 points, while earning 106 penalty minutes, in 191 games played.\nProfessional.\nOn April 3, 2014, Johnson signed an amateur tryout contract with the Albany Devils, and played five games with the AHL team near the end of the 2013–14 season. On May 20, 2014, the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League signed Johnson to a three-year entry-level contract.\nOn December 7, 2018, having served his prison sentence, Johnson resumed his professional career during the 2018–19 season, signing a contract with the Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL.\nFollowing a two-season stint with the Cyclones, Johnson sat out for the COVID-19 pandemic affected 2020–21 season. He made his return to the ECHL during the 2021–22 season, agreeing to a contract with the Kansas City Mavericks on December 5, 2021.\nSexual assault conviction.\nIn March 2013, Johnson was charged with two counts of sexual assault in connection with two separate incidents that allegedly took place in Windsor. The first occurred against a 16-year-old girl in the washroom of Mynt nightclub during the Spitfires' end of season St. Patrick's Day party. Johnson forced her to perform oral sex in a bathroom stall while she was intoxicated before he raped her, causing vaginal bleeding. During the course of the investigation, a second woman, aged 20, came forward and told police that she had also been sexually assaulted by Johnson in the washroom of a second bar weeks prior. He was found guilty on September 1, 2016, of the charge related to events at the Mynt nightclub. That same day, the Devils initiated the process to terminate Johnson's contract. On October 25, 2016, he was sentenced to a 3-year prison term for the sexual assault."

        "title": "University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club",
        "text": "The University of South Florida St. Petersburg Baseball Club was founded during the 2013 Fall semester. The club's president, founder, and head coach, Jeremy Berger, wanted to offer USFSP students the opportunity to play college baseball competitively. Even though the team is treated as a fraternity, both male and female students are welcomed to join the team.\nThe team's opening game was against the University of South Florida Tampa Campus' team. The USFSP baseball team won and earned well deserved bragging rights and huge momentum the team carried throughout the rest of the season. The team finished its inaugural opening season with an 18–5 season and played against larger, well established teams like the University of Florida and Florida State University. The team also traveled to Miami to play the University of Miami. However, because the team is considered only a club and is not a registered, official team, the USFSP Baseball Club was ineligible to play or qualify for any championships or playoffs.\nHowever, the team does have long-term plans of becoming an NCAA team. In the meantime, the officers and players are focusing on recruiting more talented players. This way, the team can gain more acknowledgment and support from faculty and students. They also want to establish a name for themselves amongst other colleges. The team also hopes that more fans will come out to support the baseball team during their games next season, even if they do not like baseball. Players have said that simply coming to the game to support student athletes, friends, and classmates is encouraging.\nDespite being barred from championships at the present time, the team did have some special acknowledgments and awards to accompany its amazing first season including an acknowledgment from USF President Dr. Judy Genshaft and was the 2013-14 New Organization of the Year. Berger was also nominated for student leader of the year.\nThe season began on February 15, 2014, with USF St. Petersburg playing against USF Tampa. The competition was dubbed “The Battle of the Bay” and was inspired by the already existent inter-campus rivalries. Dozens of students from both campuses arrived to cheer on their teams. Although the Tampa team, which was also playing its inaugural game, lost the 9-inning contest, both teams hope to make the inter-campus games an annual tradition.\nFor its first season, the team made Al Lang Stadium and Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium its home stadiums. The Al Lang Stadium, a couple blocks away from the school campus and in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, hosts dozens of sporting events for several different teams and sports. During soccer season, the stadium is transformed into a soccer field and hosts The Rowdies, the St. Petersburg professional soccer team. When the season is over, however, the field is transformed into a baseball field and allows for amateur baseball teams to play. The Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium was the former spring training field for the Tampa Bay Rays. However, when the Rays moved spring training to the Charlotte Sports Park, the Walter Fuller Baseball Stadium started hosting high school baseball teams and baseball tournaments. \nOn June 5, 2014, the St. Petersburg City Council held a meeting to determine if future contracts with the USFSP team will be made. The council decided in favor for these future contracts to be written. Now, the team has a place to play for at least one more season.\nUSF St. Petersburg has yet to build a stadium for any of the school's organized sports to be played on teams. The small campus does have a gym with dozens of work out machines, a pool, a couple basketball courts, and a waterfront program that gives sailing, scuba diving, and paddle boarding lessons just to name a few of its services. \nThe only team that the USFSP campus houses is the sailing team. This team keeps all of its equipment in the school's harbor and waterfront storage house. Because the school borders against the water, the sailing team practices and races in the ocean behind the campus. Also, because of the nature of this water sport, no benches or bleachers have been made to observe the races from land. \nAll the other USF teams are based out of the USF Tampa campus. However, even in Tampa, the teams often have to go to a different, already established stadium for professional teams in order to play. Even the USF football team has to travel to Raymond James Stadium (the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers) to play opponents in games.\nDespite the USFSP baseball team having an impressive first season and bring more sports to the St. Petersburg campus, it is not the first time a baseball team has represented the small, coastal campus. For several years during the 1970s, not a full decade after the campus was founded, students had built a team as well. Like today, the team was categorized as a club rather than an actual, registered team - likely due to the fact that it is a club, not a registered team. Players brought their own gloves, bats, and other equipment in order to play since the school did not provide any. Despite this, the team still played larger universities and had impressive season records, much like today's team. Because the USFSP would rarely win against these other registered teams, it often confused the other team about what to do with their records. Other universities did not know if these games should count as wins since the USFSP team was not registered. It was common for these teams to decide not to include the USFSP games in their records. They simply considered the games to be practice or warm ups for the rest of the season."

        "title": "Brazil v Germany (2014 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "The Brazil vs Germany football match (also known by its score as 7–1) that took place on 8 July 2014 at the Mineirão stadium in Belo Horizonte was the first of two semi-final matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nBoth Brazil and Germany reached the semi-finals with an undefeated record in the competition, with the Brazilians' quarter-final with Colombia causing them to lose forward Neymar to injury, and defender and captain Thiago Silva to accumulation of yellow cards. Despite the absence of these players, a close match was expected, given both teams performed comparably well throughout the tournament. Also, both were regarded as two of the biggest traditional FIFA World Cup forces, sharing eight tournaments won and having previously met in the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final, where Brazil won 2–0 and earned their fifth title. \nThis match, however, ended in a historic loss for Brazil; in a massive show of dominance, Germany led 5–0 within 29 minutes, with four goals being scored inside a six-minute span, and subsequently brought the score up to 7–0 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal through Oscar in the last minute, ending the match 7–1. Germany's Toni Kroos was selected as the man of the match.\nThe game marked several tournament records. Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a FIFA World Cup semi-final. The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest-scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. Miroslav Klose scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches, going back to the 1975 Copa América (where they lost 3–1 to Peru in the same stadium), and equalled their biggest margin of defeat in a match alongside a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920. It was also Brazil's worst margin of defeat in a World Cup match, with their previous worst loss in that category being their 3–0 loss to France in the 1998 final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Paris.\nUltimately, the match was described as a national humiliation. The game has subsequently been dubbed the Mineirazo () in reference to the Mineirão stadium, evoking a previous \"spirit of national shame\" known as the \"Maracanaço\" in which Brazil unexpectedly lost in the de facto final of the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay. Brazil subsequently lost 3–0 to the Netherlands in the third-place play-off, while Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time, defeating Argentina in the final. This marked Germany’s fourth World Cup triumph, bringing them joint-second behind five-time winners Brazil.\nBackground.\nBrazil were hosting the FIFA World Cup for the second time (the first being 1950), and had won the tournament on five previous occasions. Germany were three-time winners but had not won the tournament in 24 years. Brazil were in the semi-finals for the first time since 2002, from which they emerged victorious and subsequently won the tournament against Germany; while Germany was in a record-breaking fourth consecutive semi-final. Both teams had entered the tournament among the favourites to win, with Germany ranked 2nd and Brazil ranked 3rd in the FIFA World Rankings. It was only the second World Cup match between the two sides.\nBrazil's route to the semi-final included a group stage with Croatia, Mexico and Cameroon in Group A, from which they advanced with seven points before beating Chile in the Round of 16 in a penalty shoot-out, and Colombia in the quarter-finals. Germany had been drawn with Portugal, Ghana and the United States in Group G, and advanced with seven points before beating Algeria in the Round of 16 (after extra time) and France in the quarter-finals. The two teams had met in 21 previous matches, but their only previous encounter in the single-elimination round of the World Cup was the final of the 2002 FIFA World Cup that was a 2–0 victory for Brazil, which was Luiz Felipe Scolari's first tenure as manager of Brazil while Miroslav Klose was in Germany's starting lineup.\nBrazil defender and captain Thiago Silva was suspended for the match due to accumulation of yellow cards, despite an appeal against the suspension by the Brazilian Football Confederation. Forward Neymar was also unavailable for the match, having been sidelined for the rest of the tournament after suffering a fractured vertebra in the quarter-final match against Colombia. Dante and Bernard, making their first starts of the tournament, replaced Thiago Silva and Neymar respectively with Luiz Gustavo replacing Paulinho in defensive midfield. Germany were unchanged from their quarter-final. Goalkeeper Júlio César and stand-in captain David Luiz paid tribute to Neymar by holding his shirt during the national anthem ceremony. Even with the absences, analysts expected a close match, feeling the home crowd could provide an advantage.\nMatch.\nBoth teams had reached the semi-finals undefeated in their previous matches of the tournament. The officiating team was led by Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez, in what would be the final match of his career.\nFirst half.\nBoth teams started with attacking play, with Brazilian Marcelo's shot going wide in the third minute and German Sami Khedira's shot in the seventh minute being inadvertently blocked by his teammate Toni Kroos. In the 11th minute, the Germans scored from their first corner of the game. Thomas Müller escaped his marker, David Luiz, in the penalty box, and Toni Kroos's delivery found him wide open for a side-footed shot into the net. In the following minutes Brazil tried to respond but their attacks came to nothing, although Philipp Lahm delivered a tackle to keep Marcelo from setting up a chance in the penalty box. Instead, in the 23rd minute, Germany scored again after Kroos and Müller combined to set up Miroslav Klose, who scored on the rebound after his initial shot was saved by goalkeeper Júlio César. This goal was Klose's 16th and final ever World Cup finals goal, passing the record he previously shared with Ronaldo, a Brazilian.\nKlose's goal initiated a flurry of German scoring as Brazil lost control of the game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike from the edge of the area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a one-two with Khedira before scoring again. Kroos' goals came just 69 seconds apart. Khedira himself scored in the 29th minute after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil. All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. In contrast, Brazil had no shots on target in the first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly in shock or reduced to tears, and many would leave the stadium before the second half. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.\nSecond half.\nBrazil's substitution of Paulinho for Fernandinho and Ramires for Hulk resulted in an improvement in their play after the restart; Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer saved shots in quick succession from Oscar, Paulinho and Fred. By the 60th minute, though, the Germans came close to scoring again, with Júlio César denying Müller twice. Another German goal nonetheless came in the 69th minute – Lahm's low cross found substitute André Schürrle, who side-footed the ball into the net from close range. 10 minutes later, Schürrle ran onto Müller's cross from the left and hit a powerful shot over César at the near post. At this point with the score at 7–0, the remaining home fans gave the Germans a standing ovation, applauding both Schürrle's goal and Germany's overall performance. Close to the end, Özil received a through ball but just missed the chance to make it an eighth goal. Seconds later, Oscar received a long ball and scored in the 90th minute to make it 7–1. The final score matched Brazil's worst loss (6–0 to Uruguay in 1920) and ended a run of 62 competitive home matches unbeaten for Brazil. The Brazilian players left the pitch in tears to a chorus of boos and jeers.\nToni Kroos was selected Man of the Match, with three shots, two goals, 93% pass accuracy, one assist and two chances created.\nBrazilian striker Fred, who was replaced by Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, run or interception during the match, and actually spent the majority of his time in possession of the ball on the centre spot due to six restarts.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=k1 /&gt;&lt;section end=k1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nRecords.\nThe game's result was the biggest winning margin in a World Cup semi-final or final. The outcome was also the worst loss by a host country in World Cup history, as the six-goal difference doubled the previous record margin. By the end of the game, a total of 167 goals had been scored at the 2014 World Cup, the 2nd-most at a single World Cup, after 1998 with 171 goals. With 18 total shots on target, the match had the joint-most shots on target of any match in 90 minutes at the 2014 World Cup. The match also had the fastest four goals scored in World Cup history, with Germany scoring in the span of six minutes (from 23′ to 29′); in 1954, Austria took seven minutes (25′ to 32′) and in 1982, Hungary also took seven minutes (69′ to 76′) to score four goals. Germany equalled the record for most goals scored against the host nation of the World Cup, with Austria defeating Switzerland 7–5 in the 1954 World Cup. Germany also overtook Brazil to become the all-time highest-scoring team in FIFA World Cup history, their total of 223 at full-time passing Brazil's 221. Before the match Brazil and Germany were even with seven World Cup finals each; the German victory made them the only squad to reach 8 finals.\nFor Brazil, the result became one of their two worst losses, equalling a 6–0 defeat to Uruguay in Valparaíso in 1920, and was their worst defeat at home; their previous worst defeat at home was a 5–1 defeat by Argentina in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. The loss broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches, dating back to their 1–3 loss to Peru in the 1975 Copa América; this match was also played at Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte. The last time Brazil had lost a World Cup semi-final was in 1938, in a dramatic game against Italy in Marseille, and had emerged victorious from this stage the previous six times they had reached it, since the loss in 1974 against Netherlands was not formally a semi-final. Brazil had never before conceded seven goals at home, although they once conceded eight goals in an 8–4 friendly defeat to Yugoslavia on 3 June 1934; the last time they conceded at least five was in a 6–5 win in the 1938 World Cup versus Poland; at least four was in a 4–2 defeat at the 1954 World Cup against Hungary. Brazil's largest losing deficit at the World Cup prior to the match was three goals, which came in the 3–0 defeat to France in the 1998 final. The game's outcome also marked Brazil's worst result against Germany, passing a 2–0 defeat in a 1986 friendly.\nFor Germany, the final result meant that, for the fourth straight time, they were positioned among the tournament's top three teams; moreover, the victory allowed the Germans to become the first side to reach eight World Cup finals. Germany became the first team to score 7 goals in a World Cup semi-final. The last time a team scored six goals was West Germany in 1954 versus Austria, same as in both semi-finals in 1930. Only two teams have previously trailed by at least five goals at half-time: Zaire (versus Yugoslavia in 1974) and Haiti (versus Poland in 1974). The seven goals scored by Germany reflected a better goal-scoring record in the World Cup Finals than that of 28 other nations in their respective history of the World Cup.\nGermany's Miroslav Klose equalled the Brazilian Cafu as the player with most matches being on the winning side at the World Cup, with 16 victories. Klose played his 23rd World Cup match, equalling Paolo Maldini on 2nd place on most World Cup matches, with only Lothar Matthäus remaining with more (25). Klose has played in more knockout games than Matthäus or Cafu – 13, and also became the only player to take part in four World Cup semi-finals (Uwe Seeler previously played in three semi-finals). In the match, he broke the record for the most goals scored at the World Cup with 16, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo's total of 15; Ronaldo was in attendance at the match as a TV Globo's commentator. Thomas Müller's goal was Germany's 2,000th in the history of their national team. Toni Kroos' first-half double scored in 69 seconds was the fastest brace scored in World Cup history by the same player. This was also the fifth time that Germany defeated the host nation of tournament, after Chile in 1962, Spain in 1982, Mexico in 1986 and South Korea in 2002 (this last also in a semifinal).\nReactions.\nProfessional.\nAccording to reports, after Germany had scored their fifth goal with Khedira, Neymar, who was also watching the match on television in his home in Guarujá, Brazil, switched off his set and went to play poker. World Cup-winning Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said the result was the \"worst loss by a Brazilian national team ever\" and accepted all responsibility for the defeat. He called it \"the worst day of my life\", and resigned after the tournament. Stand-in captain David Luiz and goalkeeper Júlio César both offered apologies to the people of Brazil. Fred, who was booed by Brazilian fans during the match, said it was the worst defeat in his and his teammates' careers. He later announced his retirement from international football following the tournament. Recovering from his injury, Neymar expressed his support to his teammates and, despite the 7–1 score, said he was proud to be a part of the team.\nDuring the match, the German team seemed to realise that what was unfolding was not a normal football event. In a post-match statement, Mats Hummels said that the German team had decided that they did not want to humiliate the Brazilians during the second half and after the match:\nAccordingly, the Germans cut theatrics from their goal celebrations; arms were raised but there was no jumping or screaming after scoring. Coach Joachim Löw stated his team had \"a clear, persistent game-plan\", and as they realised Brazil were \"cracking up\", they took advantage as in contrast to the Brazilians' nervousness the German players were \"extremely cool\". Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in \"no game of the Cup, [the Brazilians] played their best\", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: \"we took all the balls, and scored the goals\". Müller said he was \"shocked by just how open Brazil were\" as \"Gustavo, Luiz, Dante, Fernandinho and Marcelo were shambolic in their positioning\", being confused and disorganized, noting that his German teammates benefited overwhelmingly as \"the spaces were bigger than against defence-minded teams\".\nLöw also declared the team had \"no euphoria\" during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying \"We didn't celebrate. We were happy, but we still have a job to do\".\nFollowing the match, the German players and managers offered words of consolation to the Brazilians. Löw and players Per Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm even compared the pressure on the Brazilian team and resulting heartbreaking defeat with Germany's own when they hosted the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also lost in the semifinals. Lahm added in an interview after the tournament that he had felt \"very uneasy\" during the match and \"not at all euphoric\" since the Brazilian team had made mistakes that \"don't usually happen at this level\", and Mertesacker noted that despite featuring the Germans at the top of their game, \"even from the bench, [the semifinal] was crazy to watch\". Kroos stated that, despite Brazil having good players, \"they couldn't show their best performance\" due to all the outside pressure, and expressed faith in \"them returning with a good squad\". Löw observed in the immediate aftermath of the match that the Brazilian people were applauding his team. Later the Brazilian newspaper \"O Globo\" expressed appreciation for the gestures of the German players, calling them \"world champions of sympathy\".\nBrazilian footballing icon Pelé tweeted, \"I always said that football is a box of surprises. Nobody in this world expected this result,\" followed by, \"[Brazil] Will try to get the sixth title in Russia. Congratulations to Germany.\" Carlos Alberto Torres, the captain of Brazil's winning team in 1970, said that the country lost due to a \"feeling of 'we've already won'\". He added that \"Germany played how I like to see and Scolari's tactics for this match were suicidal\". In contrast, Argentinian icon Diego Maradona was seen singing a song mocking the Brazilian defeat.\nSociety.\nIn Germany, the match's coverage by ZDF set a record for the country's most watched TV broadcast, with 32.57 million viewers (87.8% of all viewers), beating the Germany–Spain match at the 2010 World Cup. This record was beaten five days later with the final. In contrast, despite a weekly spike in audience, the broadcast by Brazilian TV Globo saw the viewers total fall with each German goal.\nThe match was the most discussed sports game on Twitter with over 35.6 million tweets, surpassing Super Bowl XLVIII, with 24.9 million tweets during the game. At first incentive hashtags such as \"#PrayForBrazil\" were common, but once Germany built a 5–0 lead Brazilian users instead lent their frustration into self-deprecatory humor, comparing Germany's goals with the Volkswagen Gol car and stating the Brazilian team looked like \"11 Freds\". Other Twitter users compared Germany's dominating performance to their military efforts during World War II and The Holocaust, for example, dubbing it the \"Goalocaust\". Bung Moktar Radin, a member of parliament of Malaysia, came under heavy criticism from the Malaysian public and the German ambassador, Holger Michael, for posting such a comment. Many comments had derisive sexual connotations, like \"Brazilian team decided to file a case in the court against Germany for gang rape.\" Pornhub issued a plea to stop uploading highlight videos of the match under titles like \"Young Brazilians get fucked by entire German soccer team.\"\nThe President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, stated on Twitter following the match that \"like all Brazilians, I am deeply saddened by our loss.\" The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Yigal Palmor, mentioned the match when countering Brazil's claim that his country was using disproportionate force in the Gaza conflict, saying \"This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, you think it is proportional, but when it finishes 7–1 it's disproportionate.\"\nDue to the pressure on the home nation Brazil, who were odds-on favorites to win the World Cup, and the subsequent shock of the loss, the media and FIFA dubbed the game the \"Mineirazo\" (\"Mineiraço\" in Brazil), meaning \"The Mineirão blow\", evoking the \"Maracanazo\" (\"Maracanaço\") in which Brazil were defeated on home soil by outsiders Uruguay in the \"de facto\" final of the 1950 World Cup. The daughter of goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa, who was scapegoated for the 1950 defeat, said the loss was enough to redeem her father's legacy, while Uruguayan striker Alcides Ghiggia, responsible for the Cup-winning goal of the \"Maracanazo\", felt that though both games were traumatic they could not be compared as the 1950 match had more at stake. Following the match, German fans were escorted out of the stadium by police and police were put on alert for possible riots. Observers noted that while the German supporters had shown respect to the defeated hosts, Argentinian fans were celebrating Brazil's elimination.\nThere were reports of a mass robbery at a fan party in Rio de Janeiro and of fans setting fire to Brazilian flags in the streets of São Paulo even before the match was over. A number of buses were burned across São Paulo and an electronics store was looted.\nMedia.\nBrazilian newspapers greeted the result with headlines such as \"The Biggest Shame in History\" (\"Lance!\"), a \"Historical humiliation\" (\"Folha de S.Paulo\") and \"Brazil is slain\" (\"O Globo\"). German paper \"Bild\" heralded the \"7–1 Madness\" by the \"Lightning DFB team\", with a front page headline of \"Ohne Worte\" (Without Words). The French \"L'Équipe\" simply said, \"Le Désastre\" (The Disaster). Writing for Sky Sports, Matthew Stanger described the game as the \"ultimate embarrassment\", while Miguel Delaney of ESPN referred to the match as the \"Mineirazo\", echoing the term invented for the event by the South American Spanish language press.\nBarney Ronay in \"The Guardian\" described it as \"the most humiliating World Cup host nation defeat of all time\", and Joe Callaghan of \"The Independent\" described it as \"the darkest night in Brazil's footballing history\". Wyre Davies, the BBC's Rio de Janeiro correspondent, said of Brazilian's reactions at the stadium and fan parks, \"The collective sense of shock, embarrassment and national humiliation across Brazil was impossible to ignore\". Football journalist Tim Vickery postulated that the result might be the catalyst for overdue reform of Brazilian club football, which in his opinion had become complacent in comparison to other countries, resting on the laurels of the national team's history of success. In his words, this was a chance to \"recapture parts of its historic identity and reframe them in a modern, global context\". Reporters compared the result with the \"Maracanazo\" that cost Brazil a title at home in 1950, with the Brazilian media even considering that the 2014 defeat redeemed the 1950 squad.\nAnalysts deconstructed all the tactical and technical deficiencies that led to the blowout result. Scolari still relied on the team that won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup despite many players going through dry spells, and most of them not having any World Cup experience. Neymar was such a focal point that the team barely trained any formations without him. In his absence, Scolari replaced Neymar with Bernard to maintain the attacking tradition of Brazilian football, instead of the \"'logical call' [which] was surely to bring in an extra midfielder\" against the Germans. The assistant coaches even supported bringing in the more defensive-minded Ramires and Willian. Thus, Fernandinho and Luiz Gustavo were overwhelmed by the Germany midfield trio of Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger. The defense that had already been questioned in previous games collapsed as Dante was proven to be an inadequate replacement for the suspended Silva, while David Luiz made uncharacteristic errors during the semi-final. Other errors included setting up Marcelo for a more attacking style of play, tasking Gustavo with covering for Marcelo on defense, and playing Fred, often regarded as a tactical striker, in a goal-scoring role where he was ineffective.\nAftermath.\nAs a result of being eliminated in the semi-finals, Brazil played in the third place game at the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in Brasília, and never got to play at their home stadium of the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro for the entire tournament despite being hosts. Brazil finished fourth after being defeated 3–0 in the third place play-off by the Netherlands on 12 July, where two of the three goals were conceded in the first 17 minutes. The defeat meant that Brazil had conceded a total of 14 goals throughout the tournament, which was the most they had conceded in a single tournament, the most conceded by a World Cup host, and the most conceded by any team since Belgium allowed 15 during the 1986 tournament. Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time and the first as a unified nation, after defeating Argentina 1–0 in extra time in the Final on 13 July at the Maracanã. Germany had the support of the Brazilian crowd despite having eliminated the home team, given Brazil has a long-standing football rivalry with neighbours Argentina.\nThe two consecutive losses, Brazil's first consecutive home defeats since 1940, led to coach Scolari's resignation on 15 July. Two weeks later, the Brazilian Football Confederation brought back Dunga as head coach of the Brazil national team. He had managed the team from 2006 until 2010, being dismissed following a 2–1 loss to the Netherlands in the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals. He was dismissed for a second time, however, following Brazil crashing out at the group stage of the Copa América Centenario in the United States two years later.\nThe Brazil senior team did not play a match at the Estádio Mineirão again until a 3–0 win over Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in November 2016. \nBrazil and Germany's next meeting in a major tournament was two years later when their under-23 teams faced each other in the gold medal match of the 2016 Summer Olympics' men's tournament at the Maracanã as Rio de Janeiro hosted the Games. Both opposing coaches — Rogerio Micale for Brazil and Horst Hrubesch for Germany — downplayed the fact that the gold medal match was a rematch of the World Cup semifinal, but some fans viewed the Olympic final as a chance for revenge and redemption. Brazil won 5–4 on penalties to win their first Olympic football gold medal after the match finished 1–1 after both normal time and extra time, with Neymar scoring the winning penalty. The next time Brazil and Germany faced each other again at senior level after the 2014 World Cup was a friendly at the Olympiastadion in Berlin in March 2018; Brazil won 1–0 on a first half goal from Gabriel Jesus. \nIn Brazil, the result, \"7–1\" (), has become a metaphor for a devastating and crushing defeat, while \"Goal for Germany\" () is used as an exclamation after a mishap."

        "title": "ACT Veterans Rugby Club",
        "text": "The ACT Vets are a rugby union team based in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT), whose players must be 35 years of age or older. Portsea Oval, at the Royal Military College, Duntroon is the club's home ground.\nThe Patron in Chief of the club is General David Hurley, Governor-General of Australia. Other Honorary Patrons are General Sir Peter Cosgrove, Air Chief Marshal Sir Angus Houston, Vice Admiral Ray Griggs and Lieutenant General John Frewen.\nHistory.\nJohn Hillier was captain/coach of the Canberra Royals 5th Grade team in 1994 and, at the age of 34, was getting tired of running with much younger players and decided to establish a club for older players who still wanted to play rugby but did not want to be involved in grade competitions. The Evergreens, a Canberra Golden Oldies team, was only formed every three to four years to play in international Golden Oldies tournaments. Hillier felt there was a need to have a regular schedule of games to keep players involved in the sport in their post grade-competition years. With the assistance of Wests Lions and the Queanbeyan Whites, Hillier developed plans for a regular game schedule for a new veterans’ rugby team.\nThe ACT Veterans Rugby team played its first game at O’Connor Oval in March 1995. More than thirty players turned up for the first game together with many officers from the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC). It was the start of a new co-operative relationship with the RMC that has remained ever since. Given the large numbers for the first game, it was decided to form three teams playing each other over three 20-minute periods. The tradition of the three ‘halves’ has continued on. The early games also established other rules of Veterans Rugby, like no pushing in scrums but contested line-outs, rucks and mauls. This schedule of games at O’Connor Oval with RMC continued through the 1995 and 1996 seasons and in 1997, at the invitation of RMC, the ACT Veterans moved to Portsea Oval which has been the club's home ground ever since. Hillier was president of the club for 21 years.\nJournalist, Chris Dutton, described the club as \"the most powerful rugby club in Australia\" in his 27 March 2014 article in the Canberra Times. \"World Cup winners, rugby league legends, politicians and Defence Force chiefs – meet the most powerful rugby team in Australia: the ACT Veterans\", he wrote.\nColours and Logo.\nThe ACT Veterans Rugby Club competition jersey colours are Royal Blue, White, Gold, Sky Blue, Maroon, Red, Black and Myrtle Green. These are the colours of the eight senior rugby clubs that existed when the Vets were formed in 1995. Navy blue, white and gold, the Brumbies traditional colours, were chosen for the shorts. The Vets logo is also an adaption of the Brumbies logo and shows their close affiliation with the Brumbies, Canberra and southern NSW region's Super Rugby team. Brumbies wild horses inhabit Canberra's hinterland.\nCharities.\nThe club plays most games, including a curtain-raiser for the Brumbies every year, to generate sponsorship and donate to their charities. They have raised well over $650,000 for charities including Legacy Australia, Soldier On, the George Gregan Foundation, Menslink, Clare Holland House, the Heart Foundation, the Pediatrics Unit of the Canberra Hospital and Snowy Hydro SouthCare with the help of their sponsors."

        "text": "James Cahill (born 27 December 1995) is an English professional snooker player from Blackpool. Cahill first turned professional in 2013, aged 17, after winning the European Under 21 Championships, but returned to amateur status in 2017.\nAs an amateur, Cahill reached the main stage of the 2019 World Snooker Championship, becoming the first amateur player ever to qualify for the event. At the tournament, he defeated world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–8 in their first round match. O'Sullivan was the second former world number one Cahill had defeated in the 2018–19 snooker season, after his victory over Mark Selby at the 2018 UK Championship. Cahill qualified for a new two-year tour card as the second highest ranked player on the one year list who was not in the top 64 in the world after the 2018–19 season. He rejoined the professional tour in June 2019, only to be relegated again in June 2021, and rejoin June 2022.\nCareer.\nCahill was born on 27 December 1995 to Maria and Patrick Cahill. Cahill was an amateur player until 2013, when he entered the 2013 EBSA European Under-21 Snooker Championships as the fourteenth seed. At 17, he defeated Joseph McLaren and Ross Muir 4–3, Elliot Slessor 4–1 and Darryl Hill 5–1 in the semi-final to play sixteen year old Ashley Carty in the final. The final, played as a best of 11 match, saw Cahill whitewash Carty 6–0 to win the tournament. Having won the event, Cahill gained a two-year tour card for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 snooker seasons, allowing him to play in all professional tournaments.\nProfessional career.\nCahill won just three matches during the 2013/2014 season, and ended his debut season on tour ranked world number 117. He played in the main stages in the 2013 UK Championship and the 2013 Welsh Open, but did not progress past the first round in either competition, losing to Joe Perry 6–3, and Ken Doherty 4–0. Cahill's second season saw him improve his results as he twice reached the last 32 in the minor-ranking European Tour events. At 18 years old, he then went on his best run to date in a ranking event during the 2014 UK Championship. He won comfortably in the first round, beating veteran Mark King 6–0 and then saw off former Welsh Open finalist Andrew Higginson 6–4. Cahill faced world number three Ding Junhui, a player who had won five ranking titles the previous season, and raced into a 5–1 lead. Ding won three frames in a row and needed three snookers in the next frame, which he got when Cahill left a . Cahill responded by taking the deciding frame to record the biggest victory of his career up to that point.\nIn the last 16 of the championships, Cahill commented he couldn't \"believe how badly [he] played\" after his tournament ended with a 2–6 loss to Mark Davis. Cahill had a poor end to the season as he lost seven out of eight matches after this which would have relegated him from the tour as he finished 85th in the world rankings. However, his performance in the European Tour events saw him finish high enough on the European Order of Merit to retain his spot on the tour for the following two seasons. In the 2015–16 season, Cahill failed to win more than one match at an event, winning just five matches all year. He competed at the main stage of the 2015 UK Championship, where he lost to Anthony McGill 6–3. Appearing at the 2016 Welsh Open, he won his first round match for the first time, defeating Xiao Guodong 4–1, but then lost 1–4 to Mark Davis. Cahill finished the season 110th in the rankings.\nCahill's 2016–17 season was a breakout year, where he appeared in many more main stage tournaments than any of his previous seasons. He appeared for the first time at both the 2016 Riga Masters, losing 3–4 to Zhao Xintong; and then 2016 World Open losing to Liang Wenbo 2–5. Cahill progressed to the third round of the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic by eliminating Kevin Vandevoort 4–0 and Ryan Day 4–2. In the third round, he drew world number one Mark Selby. Despite being 1–3 behind, he made two breaks above 50 to come back to tie the match at 3–3, but lost the deciding frame. The next event of the season saw him beaten 1–4 by Joe Swail in the second round of the English Open, after beating Adam Stefanow 4–3 in the opening round.\nFollowing this, Cahill lost in the first round of five ranking events, including the UK Championship and Welsh Open. He did, however, defeat Robbie Williams and Noppon Saengkham before losing to Ken Doherty in the third round of the non-ranking one-frame Snooker Shoot-Out event. He finished the season losing in the opening round of qualification for the 2017 World Snooker Championship, losing to Robbie Williams 1–10. Having finished the season with a world ranking of 106, Cahill required a successful run in 2017 Q School to remain on the tour. After exiting in the opening round Andres Petrov 2–4 of the first event, he fared better at the second event, defeating Jaspal Bamotra, James Silverwood, Alex Taubman and Ashley Carty but losing 2–4 to Paul Davison to confirm his relegation from the tour.\nAmateur career and World Snooker Championship.\nCompeting as an amateur, Cahill appeared in two professional events, at the 2017 Snooker Shoot Out, where he defeated Rory McLeod before losing to Graeme Dott, and the 2018 Gibraltar Open where he defeated Eden Sharav 4–1, before losing to Noppon Saengkham 1–4. Post-season, Cahill entered 2018 Q School. He reached the fifth round of all three events. At the first event he lost to Jordan Brown 4–1, the second event, to Jamie Cope 3–4, and Kuldesh Johal 3–4 in the final event. Having only reached the fifth round, he did not win a place back on tour for the next season, and returned to being an amateur player.\nCahill played the season as an amateur player, but was allowed into the main stage of events through qualifying. Cahill defeated Liang Wenbo in qualifying to reach the 2018 World Open mainstage, but was defeated 4–5 by Andrew Higginson. At the dedicated Amateur qualifying event for the 2018 Paul Hunter Classic, Cahill defeated Conor Caniff 4–1 and Charlie Walters 4–2 to reach the event. However, Cahill lost in the first round once again to Niu Zhuang. Competing at the 2018 UK Championship as an amateur, Cahill defeated world number one Mark Selby 6–3 in the first round, allowing Selby just 79 points in the first three frames. After the victory, Cahill commented \"the standard wasn't amazing. But to beat the world number one, such a great player, is brilliant.\" He then played Sunny Akani in the second round, losing 5–6.\nAt the 2019 World Championship, Cahill was given a qualifying wildcard spot by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, despite being an amateur. He played Andrew Higginson in the first round of qualifying, and led 7–0 and 8–2, before Higginson won 7 straight frames to lead 9–8. Cahill won the last two frames of the match to win 10–9 and progress to the second round of qualifying. He then defeated Michael Holt 10–7, to set up a final qualifying round match against fellow amateur player Michael Judge. Cahill defeated Judge 10–6 to become the first amateur player to play at the main stages of the world championships at the Crucible Theatre.\nIn the first round of the championship, Cahill drew world number one and five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. Cahill led 5–4 after the first session of the match and won three of the four frames at the start of the next session to lead 8–5. O'Sullivan won the following three frames to tie the match at 8–8 before Cahill won the final two frames and the match 10–8. After beating O'Sullivan, Cahill commented \"I am over the moon, to beat the best player in the world and hold myself together on my Crucible debut.\" The match was referred to as the \"biggest shock in Crucible history\" by the BBC, with master of ceremonies Rob Walker introducing him as \"the giant killer\" for having defeated two world number ones as an amateur.\nFollowing the victory, Cahill drew world number 15 Stephen Maguire in the last 16, in a best of 25 frames match.\n Maguire won the first two frames, before Cahill tied the match at 2–2. Maguire won the next three frames to lead 5–2, before Cahill ended the first session 3–5 behind. The pair finished the second session with two frames once again between them, after Cahill won 4 of the next 6 frames to tie the match at 7–7, but Maguire won the final two frames to lead 9–7. Cahill tied the match at 11–11, and looked to lead for the first time at 12–11; however, during his break, Cahill fouled the with his waistcoat, allowing Maguire to win the frame. Cahill won frame 24, sending the match to a deciding frame. Maguire, however, overcame in the decider.\nDue to his performances (as a Q School top-up entrant) in tournaments during the 2018–19 season, Cahill secured a new two-year tour card for the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons. He finished second on the one year ranking list of those not in the top 64 in the world rankings.\n Despite having reached the second round of the world championships, Cahill started the following season with no ranking points, not having achieved the results as a professional player. However, he finished 90th in the world rankings after the 2020–21 season, and returned to being an amateur player in June 2021.\nPersonal life.\nCahill was born in Blackpool, England, to Maria and Patrick Cahill. Both parents are former amateur snooker players, with Maria having been a highly ranked player in the 1980s. The seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry was formerly married to Maria's sister Mandy. Maria runs a snooker club in Preston.\nCahill received a one-year ban from driving after being found to be under the influence whilst driving in Perth, Scotland. During qualification for the 2019 World Snooker Championship, the snooker club run by his family was burgled. Despite money being stolen and items being destroyed, Cahill's cue was left undamaged."

        "text": "The 2014 IIHF World Championship final was played at the Minsk-Arena in Minsk, Belarus, on 25 May 2014 between Russia and Finland. Russia won the game 5–2 and captured the team's 27th gold medal in history (5th since the Soviet Union dissolution).\nBackground.\nRussia played its seventh final, their most recent in 2012, hoping to capture their 27th title (5th since the Soviet Union dissolution in 1991). They progressed through the tournament undefeated, winning all nine games in regulation time before entering the final. Finland on the other side played their ninth final, having won two titles. The teams met during the preliminary round, with Russia winning 4–2. Russia's head coach Oleg Znarok was suspended for one game following an incident in the semifinal against Sweden and was not allowed to coach the team in the final nor join the post-match ceremony. Znarok did, however, communicate with the team throughout the match with a hidden microphone and joined the post-game ceremony.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe first period was an evenly and intensely fought contest with much physical play. The period featured five 2-minute penalties, three for Finland and two for Russia, with the Russians receiving two power play opportunities and the Finns one. The Russian team converted on their second power play at the 10:45 mark with a wrist shot by Sergei Shirokov from the left side that bounced in off the right post. Following the goal, the Finnish team had several chances to tie the score, and with three seconds left, Iiro Pakarinen beat Sergei Bobrovsky on a 2-on-2 breakaway to tie the game 1–1.\nAt 25:20, Zaripov was given a 2-minute interference penalty, and at 26:51, Olli Palola scored on a rebound in the slot to put the Finns up 2–1. The Russians answered back just 43 seconds later with Vadim Shipachyov setting up Alexander Ovechkin for an easy backhander in front of a diving Pekka Rinne. That goal seemed to unleash the Russians' momentum with Finland picking up two consecutive 2-minute penalties, giving the Russian team a two-man advantage for over a minute. That time was enough for Evgeni Malkin to find the back of the net at the 35:36 mark and retake the lead for Russia with a hard slapshot. With less than two minutes to go, Malkin was given a 2-minute hooking penalty. The Finnish team was unable to convert on the ensuing power play. The Russians outshot Finland 18–5 in the second period.\nAt 42:40, Finland's Tomi Sallinen received a 2-minute penalty for hooking, and at 44:24, Zaripov one-timed his first goal of the game on a great pass by Shirokov through the Finnish defence to give Russia a two-goal lead. Following a 2-minute slashing penalty to Alexander Kutuzov at 45:15, the Finns had a chance to get back in the game, but failed to score. The Finns' comeback attempts were hampered by three penalties in the game's final five minutes, the first of which resulted in tournament scoring leader Viktor Tikhonov sealing the game for the Russians with his first goal of the game and his 16th point by deflecting Kutuzov's shot with his stick.\nThe game ended 5–2 for Russia, who captured the team's 27th gold medal in history (5th since the Soviet Union dissolution in 1991).\nControversy.\nThe match got a lot of criticism by media worldwide because of the Russian team coaches' hidden microphone scandal and the judges' timer failure which caused one of Finnish team's 2-minute penalties to be actually 2 minutes and 40 seconds.\nAlso the judges got criticism for giving Finnish team penalties for very small or even non-existing rule violations and for ignoring some of the Russian team's rule violations. After the game several videos were added to YouTube which showed these mistakes. Videos reached very quickly hundreds of thousands of views as well as media attention."

        "title": "1936 Eiger climbing disaster",
        "text": "In July 1936, five climbers died while attempting to ascend the north face of the Eiger mountain in Switzerland.\nBackground.\nAfter a deadly and unsuccessful German attempt in 1935, ten climbers from Austria and Germany travelled to the still-unclimbed north face of the Eiger in 1936, but, before serious summit attempts could get underway, one climber was killed during a training climb. The weather was so bad that after waiting for a change and seeing none on the way, several climbers gave up. Only four remained: two Bavarians, Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz, and two Austrians, Willy Angerer and Edi Rainer.\nAscent and retreat.\nThe weather improved and they made preliminary explorations of the lowest part of the face. Hinterstoisser accidentally fell but was not injured. A few days later, the four men began ascending the north face. They climbed quickly, but on the second day the weather changed; clouds came down and allowed observers on the ground only intermittent visibility of the climbers on the face. On the second day, the party was bombarded by rockfall, a notorious problem on the north face route. Angerer was hit just below the shoulder blade and injured. It is said that he tried to continue climbing, but the expedition had to be stopped for the night.\nThe climbing resumed on the following day, when, during a break in the clouds, the party was observed descending. Later, it would be learned that the group had no choice but to retreat, since Angerer had suffered more serious injuries than initially assessed. The party became stuck on the face when they could not recross a difficult traverse – which became known as the Hinterstoisser traverse – from which they had pulled the rope during their ascent. Exhausted on their third day of climbing, with two days of bad weather, Hinterstoisser still tried for hours to cross the traverse, which was now covered in verglas. On the way up, Hinterstoisser had used a technique called a \"tension traverse\", where a rope is fixed and kept taut, allowing the lead climber to \"lean\" on it for balance. However, this technique cannot be used when descending.\nThe weather worsened, and falling rocks, snow, and water could be seen from the town. The group decided to abseil from the lower lip of the First Ice Field down the vertical face (the great rock barrier). A ledge ran along the wall of rock, which, if they could get to it, would lead them to the Stollenloch, an entrance to the train tunnel. As belay devices had not yet been invented, they rappelled using the Dülfersitz method. Contact was made with a railway guard at the Eigerwand railway station halfway down the descent. During their exchange, the climber claimed everything had been going all right (perhaps out of pride and knowledge that they were very close to safety). However, as Hinterstoisser set up the last abseil of the descent, an avalanche came down the mountain, taking Hinterstoisser, who had unclipped from the group, with it. He was found at the bottom of the mountain days later. Angerer also fell and was killed when his body hit the rock face, while Rainer quickly asphyxiated from the weight of the rope around his diaphragm. Only Kurz survived the avalanche, hanging on the rope with his dead comrades.\nRescue attempt.\nLate on the third day, three Swiss guides started a rescue attempt from the Eigerwand Station. They failed to reach Kurz but came within shouting distance and learned what had happened. Kurz explained the fate of his companions: one had fallen down the face, another was frozen above him, and the third had fractured his skull in falling and was hanging on the rope below him.\nIn the morning, the three guides returned, traversing the face again from a hole near the Eigerwand Station despite avalanche-prone conditions. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless. After four nights exposed to the elements, one of his hands and his arm was completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself back to the mountain face after cutting loose Angerer below him. The guides were not able to pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz, but they managed to get a rope long enough to reach Kurz by tying two ropes together. While abseiling, however, Kurz could not get the knot that joined the two ropes to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers, who were just a few metres below him, desperately trying to move himself past the knot, but in vain. He then began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with the head of his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Faced with the futility of his situation, he famously said only \"Ich kann nicht mehr\" (\"I can't [go on] anymore\") and then died.\nHis body was later recovered by a German team."

        "title": "Professional baseball in Connecticut",
        "text": "There have been numerous professional baseball teams in Connecticut since the late 1800s. Most have been minor league teams, however, some early major league teams played in Connecticut. The last major league team was the Hartford Dark Blues, which played its final season in Hartford as a charter member of the newly-established modern National League in 1876.\nHistory.\nNew Britain/Bristol.\nMinor League Baseball in New Britain has had a wide variety of teams and notable players, famous players such as Roger Clemens, David Ortiz and Curt Schilling have played for New Britain; The individual considered the fastest pitcher in professional baseball, Steve Dalkowski, also grew up in New Britain. The Boston Red Sox former AA Pawtucket Red Sox moved to Bristol in 1973, and then to New Britain in 1983. In 1995 the New Britain Red Sox became the Minnesota Twins affiliate and changed their name to the Rock Cats. The team switched its affiliation to the Colorado Rockies prior to the 2015 season and left New Britain in favor of Hartford at the end of the 2015 season, but was replaced by the Independent New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League.\nAt the end of the 2019 season, the New Britain Bees announced the franchise was leaving the Atlantic League, and reorganizing as an amateur team in the New England–based Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). The nearby Bristol Blues transferred from the FCBL to the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) at the end of 2019, creating a vacancy in the league for the Bees.\nHartford.\nHartford had nearly continuous baseball from 1874 to 1952, including early major league baseball teams from 1874 to 1877. Notable events include five league titles by the Hartford Senators. In 2016, the former minor league club from New Britain began play as the Hartford Yard Goats, but did not play a home game in Hartford until 2017.\nWaterbury.\nSeveral different Minor League Baseball teams have been located in the city of Waterbury, Connecticut since 1884. These include 1884–1888, 1891, 1894–1895, 1897–1902, 1906–1914, 1918–1928, 1947–1950, 1966–1971, and 1973–1986. Teams won their respective league championships three times in 1924, 1925, and 1970.\nThe earliest Waterbury teams played in the Connecticut State League between 1884 and 1912. These teams went by several different nicknames during this period, including the Brassmen, Brass City, Indians, Pirates, Rough Riders, Authors, Invisibles, Finnegans, Champs and Spuds. The Waterbury Brasscos (also called the Nattatucks) played in the old Eastern League from 1918–1928. They won two league titles in 1924 and 1925. The Waterbury Timers played in the Colonial League between 1947 and 1950.\nWaterbury became home to professional baseball again in 1966 when the Waterbury Giants, an affiliate of Major League Baseball's San Francisco Giants came to town. From 1966 to 1986 (with the exception of 1972), the Waterbury team played in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Giants, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Dodgers, Oakland Athletics, Cincinnati Reds and California Angels. The team name changed every time the affiliation agreement changed hands. Waterbury did not have an Eastern League team at the start of the 1972 season. However, in the middle of the season, flooding made the ballpark in Elmira, New York unusable, and so the Elmira Pioneers played their \"home games\" in the second half of the 1972 season in Waterbury.\nThe Independent Northeast League chose to place a team in Waterbury in 1997 as the Waterbury Spirit, but they moved after the 2000 season to become the North Shore Spirit.\nSummary of franchises by city.\nNew Britain/Bristol.\nFormer New Britain teams.\n "

        "title": "Pieter Rossouw (rugby union)",
        "text": "Pieter Willem Gabriel Rossouw (born 3 December 1971) is a South African former professional rugby player and current coach. Rossouw played wing for Western Province in the Currie Cup and the Stormers in the Super Rugby competition. He played a total of 43 times for the Springboks, making him one of the most capped Springbok wingers after South Africa's readmission to international rugby. He was also one of South Africa's most prolific try-scoring wingers, post-isolation, with only Breyton Paulse(26) and Bryan Habana(53) scoring more tries. He is 7th on the all-time try-scoring list for the Springboks. Rossouw is currently the backline coach of the Bulls in Super rugby and the Blue Bulls in the Currie Cup. He was known as \"Slaptjips\" (Afrikaans for potato chips or french fries), apparently because the sight of his running legs was like potato chips slapping together. Pieter is the older brother of Chris Rossouw, who played flyhalf for Western Province and the Free State Cheetahs.\nEarly life.\nRossouw was born in Swellendam in 1971. He went to school in Paarl at Paarl Gimnasium before going to university at the University of Stellenbosch, where he played for the university's rugby team.\nPlaying career.\n1994 to 1998.\nPieter Rossouw made his debut for Western Province in 1994.\nIn 1996 Rossouw was selected for the Western Province team to compete in the Super 12.\nIn 1997, South African Rugby has not yet adopted the franchise system, which New Zealand has done. Instead, the four semi-finalists of the previous year's Currie Cup competition qualified for the Super 12. In 1996, Western Province was defeated in the quarter-finals by the Gauteng Lions and did not progress to the semi-finals. Their place in 1997's Super 12 was therefore taken by the Free State Cheetahs. This meant Pieter Rossouw did not play any Super Rugby in 1997.\nDespite not featuring in the Super 12 in 1997, Rossouw was selected for the Springboks to face the touring British and Irish Lions in 1997. He made his Springbok debut against the Lions in the second test of the tour on 28 June 1997 at Kings Park in Durban. South Africa lost the game 15-18. Rossouw was again in the team to face the Lions in the third and final test, when he scored the first of his 21 test tries. South Africa won 35-16, but lost the test series 2-1.\nRossouw was part of the Springbok team that played in the annual Tri-nations series in 1997. He was one of the try scorers when South Africa beat Australia with 61 points to 22. It remains the Springboks' highest score against the Wallabies.\nAt the end of 1997 the Springboks toured to Europe, playing test matches against Italy, France, England and Scotland. Pieter Rossouw was a member of this touring squad. On 22 November 1997 South Africa faced France at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which was the French's last game at the stadium before moving to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The Springboks humiliated France by 52 points to 10. Rossouw became only the second Springbok in history to score 4 tries in one test.\nIn 1997, Western Province won the Currie Cup by beating Free State in the final by 14 points to 12 at Newlands in Cape Town. Rossouw was the left wing for Western Province on the day.\nIn 1998 South African rugby adopted the franchise system for the Super 12. New teams were formed located in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg. Cape Town had again a team in the Super 12. They weren't called Western Province, but the Stormers. The Stormers were selected from players representing Western Province, Boland and South Western Districts. This gave Rossouw the opportunity to return to Super Rugby.\nThe Springboks won the 1998 Tri Nations Series, having not lost a single game. The away game for the Springboks against the All Blacks took place at Athletic Park in Wellington on 25 July 1998. Rossouw scored the only try of the game from either side, and South Africa ended up winning 13-3. This was the Springboks' first win on New Zealand soil since readmission and also their first since 29 August 1981 at the same venue.\nFrom the 1997 tour to Europe to the second last game of the European tour of 1998, South Africa played in 17 consecutive unbeaten tests, equalising the record set by the All Blacks between 1965 and 1970. The All Blacks eclipsed this record by winning 23 consecutive tests, starting with the World Cup in 1987. However, South Africa, who ended their unbeaten run in 1970, was not part of their opposition during this period, due to the sporting boycott. Pieter Rossouw played in all 17 victorious tests for the Springboks in their unbeaten run from 1997 to 1998.\n1999.\nRossouw continued to play Currie Cup rugby for Western Province and Super Rugby for the Stormers from 1999 until his retirement in 2004, except in 2002 when he joined London Irish for one season.\nRossouw was part of the only Springbok team to have lost to Wales. On 26 June 1999 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales beat South Africa by 29 to 19. The first and, to date, only time Wales have beaten the Springboks.\nHe remained a regular selection for the Springboks in 1999, which included the World Cup, hosted by Wales. He was selected for the pool games against Scotland and Uruguay as well as the quarter-final against England and the semi-final against Australia. His only try of the tournament came against England in the quarterfinal.\n2000 to 2003.\nFrom 2000 Rossouw played less frequently for the Springboks. He played his last Tri-nations game against Australia in Sydney on 29 July 2000. He was selected for the Springboks for seven more tests with his final Springbok test on 28 June 2003 at Boet Erasmus Stadium in Port Elizabeth.\nRossouw continued to be a regular starting selection for Western Province and the Stormers and he won two successive Currie Cups with Western Province in 2000 and 2001, beating the in both finals and scoring a try in the 2000 final.\nIn 2002 it was announced that Rossouw did not renew his contract with the Stormers and SARFU and elected to sign with English Premiership team, London Irish. Arriving at London Irish, Rossouw struggled with a hamstring injury and ended up playing only eight games for the team, scoring one try. London Irish did not have a very good season, which prompted coach Brendan Venter to make himself available to play again. At the time Premiership teams were only allowed to field to overseas players, with the other being Naka Drotske. Rossouw was therefore released from his contract towards the end of 2002.\nRossouw returned to Cape Town and again played Currie Cup for Western Province and Super Rugby for the Stormers.\n2004.\nAlthough Rossouw formed part of the Stormers squad for the 2004 Super 12 season and the Western Province squad for the Currie Cup, he was eventually dropped from the team by coach Carel du Plessis before a game against the Bulls in August 2004. This led him to announce his retirement at the beginning of October 2004.\nIn total Pieter Rossouw scored 31 Super Rugby tries, placing him at 27th on the all-time highest try-scorers in Super Rugby competition history. He holds this position jointly with Ben Tune of the Reds and Lelia Masaga of the Chiefs.\nCoaching career.\nPieter Rossouw started his coaching career at Majuba residence at the University of Stellenbosch in 2006. After being involved in coaching with the Western Province Vodacom Cup team as well as the Western Province under 19 team in 2007, Rossouw was signed by the Blue Bulls Rugby Union as backline coach for the Bulls and Blue Bulls in February 2008. A position he has held since. As part of the Bulls' coaching set-up, Rossouw has won a Currie Cup trophy in 2009 and Super Rugby trophies in 2009 and 2010. He resigned from the job in June 2015 and started as Backline coach with the Namibia national rugby union team.\nHonours.\nPlaying career.\nSA Rugby Player of the Year nominee, 1997"

        "text": "Chicago Blaze Rugby Football Club is a rugby union club based in Lemont, Illinois. The Blaze's first side competes in the Midwest Rugby Football Union's Division II class.\nHistory.\nIn 1982, the Windy City Nomads merged with the Amoco Rugby Club to form the Chicago Blaze Rugby Football Club. The new club would retain the colors blue for Amoco and red for Nomads. The first Blaze jerseys had the red and blue hoops.\nPeter Thornley, one of the founding members and was instrumental to the Blaze future by bring together the two clubs and making what had been just an idea of being the first club team in the United States of America to actually own its own pitch. Before the creation of the clubhouse &amp; field in 1990, the Blaze played at the forest preserve fields on 75th St and Rt 53 in Naperville, but community disapproval of the social aspect of post game celebrations, was what ultimately led the club to look into buying their own field. Thornley, purchased a 9-acre farm on Smith Rd in 1984 for $89,000, but it would take another six years before the opening match in 1990 was played.\nThe club has hosted numerous Illinois State High School Championships, as well as CARFU Championships, and Midwest Territorial Championships.\nCurrently the club own 15 acres of land with three fields, with the main pitch having lights, locker room facilities, with showers, and a clubhouse with a bar for post-match socials, parties and events. Development continues with a play area for kids, spectator stands, horseshoe pit, and an ever-improving Rugby facility. The Blaze have traveled abroad on several international tours to England (1989), Ireland (1994), Spain (1999) and New Zealand (2002). Over the past years, the Blaze have won many Midwest Championships at Division 1 and 2 levels. The Blaze has competed in the National Championships in 1986, 1990, 1996, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nThornley Field.\nThornley Field consists of three pitches, the main one having lights, it is located in Lemont, Illinois at 13011 West Smith Road. The facilities include a clubhouse with a bar, locker room/team room, an equipment garage, outdoor pavilion and two parking lots. The fields underwent an upgrade in the mid-2000s with improved drainage and underground sprinkler system. The over-all property sits on just over 3 acres of land."

        "text": "The 1978 World Lacrosse Championship was the third edition of the international men's lacrosse tournament. The event took place at Edgeley Park in Stockport, England under the auspices of the International Lacrosse Federation. Four teams competed in the tournament: Australia, Canada, England, and the United States. Canada defeated the United States 17-16 in overtime in the final to win the tournament.\nOverview.\nIn the finals, Canada captured the 1978 World Championship with a shocking 17-16 overtime victory over the United States team.\nThe underdog label was given to the Canadian team due to their lack of field lacrosse experience, and also following a round-robin American annihilation of the Canadians, 28-4. However, two individuals with previous field experience would prove to be key factors in the longshot victory. Hall of Famers Stan Cockerton from North Carolina State and Mike French from Cornell had great tournaments. In the first game of the 1978 tournament, Cockerton whipped in seven goals with French adding three more plus seven assists to move past the host English squad 21-15.\nThe U.S. took Australia 22-17 the first day and then drubbed Canada 28-4. U.S. scored the first 14 goals even before French put Canada on the board; but the rout on the rain-drenched field continued - 17-2 at halftime and 22-3 after three periods. Meanwhile, Australia downed England 16-10. Down 4-3 early in game three against Australia, Canada whipped in six straight on the road to a 16-13 victory that set up a rematch with the Americans, who had narrowly squeaked past England 12-11.\nThe Americans opened the finals intent on repeating their earlier conquest of Canada with Cornell great Bill Marino rifling home a shot just 15 seconds after the opening faceoff. But Team Canada stunned the Americans with six unanswered goals to take an 8-4 lead after one period. The U.S. rallied to tie the contest and then moved ahead only to see Cockerton knot up the contest 16-16 with seconds remaining.\nStan Shillington wrote: \"with the entire crowd of 3,500-plus chanting for the Canadians, both teams went through a scoreless overtime session and all but 20 seconds of a second extra period. That's when Cockerton scooped in the winner, his sixth goal of the game, that gave Canada a 17-16 victory.\"\nStan Cockerton led the tourney in scoring with 18 goals and 9 assists in the four games. Mike French, with 6 goals and 15 assists, was named the \"Best and Fairest Player.\" Other awards were given to Bob Flintoff, Canada, Goalkeeper; Steve Bevington, England, Defender; John Butkiewicz, Australia, Midfielder; and Peter Cann, Australia, Attackman.\nAustralia beat England 19-9 for third place.\nResults.\nFinal.\nJuly 8, 1978"

        "text": "The 2014–15 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut (UConn) in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I basketball season. The Huskies, led by thirtieth-year head coach Geno Auriemma, play their home games at the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to win their third consecutive NCAA championship.\nThis was UConn's second season as a member of the American Athletic Conference, known as The American or AAC. The Huskies entered the season as the two-time defending national champions. The 2014–15 Huskies repeated last year's success in The American by winning the regular season championship outright. They placed an 18–0 record in the 2014–15 regular season and a 3–0 record in the 2014–15 AAC Tournament. They are a combined 42–0 (including AAC tournament wins) over two years in the conference. The closest game between the Huskies and another AAC opponent over the last two years was this year's AAC tournament championship between #1 seed UConn and #2 seed South Florida. UConn won 84–70 to win its second straight AAC tournament championship.\nMedia.\nEvery single Connecticut game was expected to be televised. Excluding exhibitions, every Connecticut home game and most conference games aired on SNY with a simulcast on Husky Vision. Select games aired on ESPN3, another ESPN Network, or CBS Sports Network. Every game was once again broadcast on the UConn IMG Sports Network with an extra audio broadcast being available online to listen to through Husky Vision.\nOff-season.\nFIBA.\nConnecticut basketball players, past present and future, were active in FIBA events during 2014. Katie Lou Samuelson has a verbal commitment to Connecticut, and played on two USA squads over the summer. In June, she played for the USA under 17 team which competed in the 2014 FIBA U17 World Championship For Women. The official events were held in Klatovy and Plzeň, Czech Republic, although some friendlies were played in Nogent-sur-Seine, France. Samuelson helped the team to a 7–0 record to win the gold medal, and earned a spot on the all-tournament team.\nSamuelson, along with future Huskies teammates De'janae Boykin and Napheesa Collier, made up three of the four players on the U18 3x3 team invited to play at the Youth Olympic Games, held in Nanjing, China 16–28 August 2014. Samuelson had turned an ankle, and was unable to play in some games, forcing her three teammates to play without substitution in some games. Despite the challenge the team won all nine matches to finish with a perfect record and the gold medal for the event. Samuelson competed in the shoot out event, one of the individuals skills competition, placing third out of 158 contestants to win the bronze medal.\nCollier was one of the twelve players selected to play on the USA team invited to play at the 2014 FIBA Americas U18 Championship held in Colorado Springs, Colorado, from August 6 to 10. In the game against the undefeated team from Canada, Collier was the leading scorer, recording a double-double with 22 points and 10 rebounds. The team went on to win all five games, earning the gold medal for the event, and an automatic bid to the U18 Championships in 2015, scheduled to be held in Russia.\nKia Nurse played on the Canadian national team in the 2014 FIBA World Championship. The team lost to Australia in the quarterfinals, then beat France and China to finish in fifth place. Nurse averaged almost 22 minutes per game at the point guard position, averaging almost seven points per games, fourth most on the roster, while being the youngest player on the roster.\nThe United States women's national basketball team participated in the 2014 FIBA World Championship in Turkey. Auriemma served as the head coach of the team, which won all six games to win the World Championship and the gold medal. Current and former UConn players on the team included:\nMoore was named the MVP of the tournament.\nRoster changes.\nStefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley were selected in the first round of the draft in consecutive picks. Dolson was chosen 6th, by the Washington Mystics. Hartley was the next player chosen, initially by the Seattle Storm, but traded an hour later to Washington, so the teammates continue to be teammates.\nBriana Banks chose to transfer to Penn State University, where she will have one year of eligibility remaining.\nThe team has four incoming freshman and one incoming transfer. Natalie Butler is a 6' 5\" center from Virginia who played for Georgetown last season before deciding to transfer to Connecticut. Per NCAA rules she will have to sit out one season, and will be eligible to play in the 2015–16 season. Sadie Edwards is from Meriden Connecticut and played one year in Middletown Connecticut before transferring to Blair Academy in New Jersey, although in early December, she chose to leave the team, with plans to transfer to another school. Courtney Ekmark is from Phoenix Arizona, although played for nationally ranked St. Mary's in California, winning three state titles and one national championship. Her family moved to Arizona, and she completed her last year of school as a home schooled student. Kia Nurse is from Hamilton, Ontario, and earned a spot on the national team of Canada. She will be playing against her future coach when the USA National team plays an exhibition game against the Canadian National team in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Connecticut's Geno Auriemma is the head coach of the USA national team. Gabby Williams is from Sparks, Nevada, and is a track star as well as a basketball player. She finished fifth in the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials for the high jump at the age of 15, although she is planning to concentrate on basketball rather than track in college. The incoming class of freshman was ranked fourth by ESPN.\nGames.\nExhibition games.\nWest Chester University.\nUConn opened their season with an exhibition game against West Chester University, the alma mater of head coach Geno Auriemma. All twelve players received playing time, and all twelve scored. None played more than 26 minutes, as all got a chance to play against someone other than their teammates in months. All five starters scored in double digits, as well as freshman Kia Nurse, who scored 12 points. Kiah Stokes recorded seven blocks in addition to 13 points. The Huskies hit all but two of their first fifteen field goal attempts to open up a 40–10 lead. The final score reflected the mismatch in talent, with UConn winning 115–26.\nPost University.\nThe second exhibition game was played against Division II Post University. Last year's player of the year Stewart scored 27 points to lead the scoring for the Huskies, one of five players with double-digit scoring. Stokes had a double-double with 15 points and 14 rebounds, while Tuck came off the bench to record her own double-double, with 22 points and 15 rebounds. The tone of the game was set early: UConn scored the first nine points, then after giving up one basket, scored 15 straight. The final score, in favor of the Huskies, was 114–44.\nRegular season games.\nUC Davis.\nFor the first time in 15 year, the Huskies opened their season on the road, playing their first game in California, the home state of Mosqueda-Lewis. The arena set an all-time record for attendance at a women's basketball game. Mosqueda-Lewis had 25 friends and family members in the stands, who came to cheer her on. She gave them plenty to cheer about, tying the school record for three-pointers made in a game with Maya Moore. Both hit ten three-pointers. The Huskies hit their first four shots of the game, all three-pointers, but UC Davis hung in there for some time, until the Huskies started a long run. They scored the final 23 points of the first half, and continued with the first 16 points of the second half, to complete a 39–0 run, believed to be one of the longest in NCAA history. Mosqueda-Lewis went to the bench for the final 11:31 after tying the record.\nStanford.\nUConn's second trip on the west coast trip was against Stanford, the number six team in the country. Stanford had stopped UConn's 90 game winning streak, the longest in NCAA history in 2010. The Huskies were bringing in a 47-game winning streak to this contest. However, after tying a UConn record days earlier, Mosqueda-Lewis did not score for the first three-quarters of the game. UConn built a ten-point lead with under seven minutes to go, but gave it up, allowing Amber Orrange to hit a three-pointer with 1.4 seconds to go in the game to send the game to overtime. Tuck and Nurse fouled out, and the Cardinals outscored the Huskies in the overtime period to take the win 88–86, and end the winning streak.\nCreighton.\nThe loss to Stanford brought back interest in one of the more unusual streaks in sports—the number of game since the team lost back-to-back games. The last time UConn lost back to back games was on the 7th and 17 March 1993. Thirteen days before the oldest current UConn player, Kiah Stokes, was born, so not a single player of the team was alive when it happened. The men's head coach, Kevin Ollie was a junior in high school.\nMosqueda-Lewis was out with the flu, so Morgan Tuck started in her place. Freshman Kia Nurse has been playing so well, she earned her first start. Nurse delivered, hitting six of seven field goal attempts, including all four three-point attempts, and ended with 22 points. Tuck also did well, with 15 points and seven rebounds.\nIt was the first home game for the Huskies, so the players were presented with their National Championship rings in a brief ceremony before the game. As well as Nurse and Tuck played, Stewart still out-did them, going ten for ten from the field, only one basket removed from an 11 for 11 performance by Rebecca Lobo in 1994. Connecticut won 96–60, extending the streak without back-to-back losses to 775.\nCollege of Charleston.\nConnecticut traveled to Florida, to take part in the Gulf Coast Showcase Tournament. Mosqueda-Lewis returned to the starting line-up. Tuck stayed in the starting group, replacing Stokes, while Nurse also remained as a starter. Connecticut scored eight points before Charleston managed to score, and the game was never close. The Huskies held a 50–13 lead at halftime, then held Charleston scoreless for six and a half minutes in the second half.\nThe final score was 85–24, with Mosqueda-Lewis leading the scoring with 21 points.\nVanderbilt.\nSaddled with early fouls, the Huskies needed to look for offence beyond reigning national player of the year Stewart, and once again Nurse and Tuck stepped up, each scoring 16 points, and probably securing their position in the starting line-up. All five starters scored in double digits, as UConn pulled out to a 53–27 lead at halftime, and coasted to a 91–52 win. The win set up a match with the other semi-final winner, Green Bay.\nGreen Bay.\nThe Green Bay Phoenix were not in awe of the Huskies as they opened up a 9–3 lead early in the game. UConn responded with a 10–0 run, but Green Bay refused to wilt, and tied the game at 26 points each. The Huskies went on an 11–0 run, and went to halftime with an eleven points, lead, but it wasn't until the opening of the second half, starting with a UConn 14–2 run, that the result seemed assured. Five UConn players reached double digits in scoring. Jefferson was the scoring leader with 19. Stewart followed with 17. Connecticut won 89–53, to win the tournament championship.\nNurse's 16 points, coupled with her results in the first two games, were enough to earn her the Most Valuable Player of the Gulf Coast Showcase Tournament.\nNotre Dame.\nNotre Dame and Jewell Loyd were unstoppable for the first ten minutes of the game, building to a 28–18 lead on perfect, six for six shooting from Loyd. Then they were stopped, as UConn went on a 22–4 run to take an eight-point halftime lead. The Irish missed 18 of 19 shots during one stretch. Tuck provided much of the offense, scoring a career-high 25 points, along with nine rebounds. Stokes was a defensive presence, with 18 rebounds. Kiah would stay for the second game to watch her brother, Darius, play in a men's game between Notre Dame and Fairleigh Dickenson. UConn won 76–58, ending Notre Dame's home winning streak of 34 games, at the time, the longest active streak in the country.\nThe Huskies would meet them again in the national title game in Tampa, Florida.\nDePaul.\nUConn ended an almost two-week hiatus with a game against 25th ranked DePaul in Bridgeport CT. The rust was evident early, as DePaul hit early shots and held even with the Huskies. Almost eight minutes into the game, the score was tied at 24 points for each team. Then UConn, led by Stewart, opened up a 20-point lead. DePaul's Hrnko had 17 points, but was more than matched by Stewart's 25 points along with double-digit scoring by Nurse, Tuck, Mosqueda-Lewis and Williams. Stokes had three of the team's five blocks. The Huskies went on to win 98–68.\nUCLA.\nUConn played another \"home\" game, this time at the Mohegan Sun Arena against UCLA. The Bruins clung to a slim 4–2 lead at the first media timeout, but Nurse and Stewart then went to work, opening up a ten-point lead, which expanded to 20 before settling back to a 15-point halftime lead. UCLA played even with UConn for the opening of the second half, but then the Huskies got going again and won 86–50. Kiah Stokes's father, Greg Stokes told his daughter he scrapped his Christmas list and all he wanted was a double-double. Kiah scored ten points and recorded her tenth rebound with a minute to go to give her father his Christmas gift.\nSMU (home).\nUConn played the conference opener against Southern Methodist University, but the story was more about other issues than the game result, which was won easily by the Huskies 96–45. Jefferson had been struggling in recent games, with only 11 games in the prior three games, and ended with a career-high 24 points. Mosqueda-Lewis hit three three-pointers to reach a career total of 311, tying her with Maya Moore for second place among UConn players. The win improved coach Auriemma's lifetime record to 888–134 for a winning percentage of 86.888% moving him ahead of second place Leon Barmore, whose winning percentage had been the best in Division I women's basketball at 86.878%\nDuke.\nIn the prior seven games between Duke and UConn, the Huskies had won by almost 29 points per game. When they met on 29 December, the Blue Devils had a two-point lead 13 minutes into the game, and while the Huskies went on a run to take a lead, the halftime margin was only seven points. A win would still be a challenge, but surely it would not be a blowout. However, the Huskies pulled away in the second half, and ended up with a 31-point victory, 83–52. The teams have played each other since 2010, but Duke declined to renew the contract. Jefferson led the Huskies with 18 points, while the other four starters all scored in double digits.\nEast Carolina (away).\nUConn played its first conference road game on New Year's Eve against East Carolina. The Huskies had a number of turnovers, and other miscues promoting Coach Auriemma to declare at halftime that in 30 years of coaching, he had never seen a worse half of basketball by his team. UConn led by 23 points at the time. The team responded in the second half, scoring 15 consecutive points to start the half. Ekmark played in the second half, her first time on the court since a stress reaction in November. UConn went on to rout them 89–23.\nSt. John's.\nOn the first Sunday of the New Year, the Huskies participated in the Maggie Dixon Classic, played in Madison Square Garden as a memorial to Maggie Dixon the former head coach of the Army women's basketball team. This was the ninth such event; the first was held at Christl Arena, Army's arena, while the last eight have been played in Madison Square Garden. This is the fourth time that Connecticut has been a participant.\nThe event is usually a double-header, typically involving Division I teams. However, because 2015 is the 40th anniversary of the first women's basketball game to be played in Madison Square Garden, the original participants made up the opening game. Division II's Queens College took on Division III's Immaculata University in a rematch of a game played on 22 February 1975. The original game was won 65–61 by Immaculata. The rematch was won by Queens 76–60.\nIn the second game, UConn faced St. John's. Tuck had 23 points, Stewart had 18 and Jefferson scored 16 in a 70–54 victory over the Red Storm.\nTulsa (home).\nThe most noteworthy event in the game against Tulsa was not the score or the outcome, but a three-point shot by Mosqueda-Lewis, which tied her with Diana Taurasi for the most three-pointers in a UConn career. She hit her 318th three early in the second half. Jefferson continued her hot shooting with eight for nine from the field, finishing with 22 points, and Tuck was close behind with 21. Nurse and Williams each added 15 points, while Stokes continued her penchant for blocks with seven. Ekmark hit her first three-pointer of her career.\nSMU (away).\nThe outcome of the game wasn't the main story. Early in the first half, Mosqueda-Lewis hit a three-pointer, something she has accomplished many times in the past. In fact, it was the 319th time in her UConn career that she has hit a three-pointer, and that placed her in first place among all UConn players. A few days earlier, she tied then went ahead of Maya Moore. Recently she tied, and now has pulled ahead of Diana Taurasi previously the holder of the record for three-pointers by a UConn women's basketball player. The game ball was presented to her at the next home game. In addition to setting the record, the UConn team defeated SMU by a score of 87–28.\nTemple (home).\nThe game against Temple was not as lopsided at the game against SMU, but it was never a contest. UConn scored 36 points in the paint before the Owls scored their first two in the paint. The Huskies had 55 points at halftime, and would need only three more to match the Temple score. It was another strong game for Tuck, who had 20 points in the first half. She played limited minutes in the second half due to the large lead. The Huskies ended up with the win 92–58.\nSouth Florida (home).\nSouth Florida is in second place in the American Conference, and came to Connecticut knowing they were underdogs, but believing they could compete. It dod not take long to change that impression. The Huskies scored the first nine points of the game, then had a 12–0 run to extend the lead to 19 points. As if that wasn't enough, Connecticut later held the South Florida team scoreless for over eight minutes while scoring 17 points. Mosqueda-Lewis was the leading scorer with 18 points, followed closely by Stewart with 17. UConn went on to win 92–50.\nUCF (away).\nUConn traveled to Orlando to take on the Central Florida Knights, the only scheduled regular season meeting of the two teams. The game result was never in doubt as the Huskies had a 61–18 lead at the half, hitting over 70% of their field goal attempts. The game was tied at two points each, but Connecticut scored the next ten points to set the tone for the game. Mosqueda-Lewis was the leading scorer for the Huskies with 23 points, hitting five of her seven three-point attempts. The final score was 100–45.\nCincinnati (away).\nUConn played the first of their two regular season games against Cincinnati at their home court. The Bearcats are coached by former stand-out player for UConn and long time assistant coach Jamelle Elliot. Auriemma has not yet lost a game to a coach who was a former player or assistant, and this would be no different. Mosqueda-Lewis hit all four of her field goals attempts in the first half, two of which were outside the three-point line on her way to 19 points for the game, which moved her ahead of Svetlana Abrosimova into tenth place on the all-time UConn scoring list. Only one starter played more than 19 minutes, as the Huskies won easily 96–31.\nEast Carolina (away).\nEast Carolina came to play UConn for the first time in Connecticut on 28 January 2015. The story line of the game wasn't the result, which the Huskies won easily 87–32, but a rare triple-double for a UConn player. Kiah Stokes was close to a triple double when assistant coach Maria Moseley urged her to get another block, a rebound, and some points. She managed to pick up the block and rebound on the same play, blocking a shot and retaining possession for a rebound but she didn't score her tenth point until there were 33 seconds left in the game, when Briana Pulido fed her a pass and she put in the layup to complete a triple double, with ten points, eleven rebounds and a school record ten blocks.\nTemple (away).\nUConn played the second of their two games against Temple at their McGonigle Hall. Temple started out positively, scoring the first five points, and still holding an 8–4 lead when UConn went on an 8–0 run to take the lead. The game was still close when Chong and Nurse hit consecutive three-pointers to open up a larger lead. The Huskies went on to win 83–49.\nCincinnati (home).\nUConn started out slowly, falling behind 5–0 for the second game in a row. The tide turned quickly, as the Huskies scored the next 15 points, and later in the half went on a 22–0 run to ensure that the outcome was never in doubt. The win was the 900th for Head Coach Auriemma and Associate head Coach Chris Dailey. They reached this win in game 1034, the fastest to 900 for any basketball coach. He is now tied for fifth place on the list of all-time women's basketball wins. His winning percentage is 87%, the best among all coaches, active or retired.\nWilliams came off the bench to score a career-high 18 points, and lead all scorers. The final was, in favor of Connecticut, was 96–36. The team celebrated by donning T-shirts with \"Geno Never Stops\" on one side and 900 on the other side. They wore homemade glasses featuring the number 900.\nMemphis (away).\nAuriemma was not happy with the way the team was starting games, having fallen behind early in the prior two games and not playing up to his expectations in the early part of the game against Memphis, so he decided to bench both Stewart and Tuck a few minutes into the game. Stokes also saw limited action. Auriemma explained \"There’s a certain level of play that I've been accustomed to at Connecticut, and if you’re not there then you’re not playing.\" Stewart and Tuck remained on the bench for the rest of the game, while the remaining players cruised to an 80–34 win over the Tigers.\nSouth Carolina (home).\nOn the ninth of February, the second ranked Huskies hosted the nation's top ranked team, the South Carolina Gamecocks. The weather was cold, blowing and snowy, with treacherous driving conditions. The arena was sold-out. A few hundred ticket-holders chose not to attend, but turned their tickets in to be given to students.\nJefferson opened the scoring with a three-point basket, but South Carolina responded, and took an 18–15 lead with 12:28 left in the first half. The Huskies then picked up the pace, out scoring the Gamecocks 32–13 for the rest of the half giving the Huskies a 16-point lead at halftime. The Gamecocks opened the second half with six consecutive points, but the Huskies again stepped up the offense, pushing the lead out to 20 points, and eventually to a 25-point margin at the final buzzer, for an 87–62 victory and a virtually certain return to the number one position in the polls.\nUConn has now played in 20 games between the top two teams in the nation, and has a 17–3 record in those games.\nTulane (home).\nThe game against Tulane was not just\nthe first meeting as part of the American Athletic Conference, but\nthe first meeting ever. The huskies led from the start, with an early\n10–0 run then a 15–0 run to take a 25–4 lead. The lead stretched to 30 points by halftime, and extended in the second half, with the final score over the Green Wave being 87–39.\nHouston (home).\nThe game against Houston was a mismatch. Stewart scored 26 points to lead the Huskies and tie the Cougars. Although it took almost two minutes for the Huskies to score and eight attempts at a three-pointer before making one, there were few other missteps in the game. UConn outscored Houston 62–8 in the paint. The final score in the first game at the nation number one seed was 85–26 in favor of UConn. \nTulsa (away).\nThe game against Tulsa was the first visit by UConn to that city. Stewart continued her fine play, scoring 23 of her 28 points in the first half, matching the Tulsa total for the first half. Mosqueda-Lewis hit five three-pointers in the first half. Five UConn players scored in double digits, with Jefferson and Nurse scoring 12 and Chong scoring 11. The final score was 92–46.\nTulane (away).\nUConn faced Tulane at their home arena, Devlin Fieldhouse. The Huskies doubled up the Green Wave 94–47, which secured at least a share of the conference regular season championship. Jefferson had eight steals, which she credited to the scouting report of Shea Ralph. The win represented the 800th game without back-to-back losses, a steak which extends back to 1993, before any of the current team members were born. The Green Wave were one of three teams in the conference with 20 or more wins.\nMemphis (home).\nThe game itself was almost an afterthought. Uconn beat Memphis 87–24 in front of a sellout crowd, but the crowd was there for Senior Day-the last regular season game of the carriers of seniors Kalana Mosqueda-Lewis and Kiah Stokes. Before the game, the seniors and their families were honored by the coaching staff and fans, walking out to hold aloft their framed jerseys, and get one more cheer from the crowd. Kalana's brother Xander stole the show by running out into the arms of Auriemma. Mosquesda-Lewis was honored by having her number added to the Huskies of Honor on the wall of Gampel, honoring very special players and teams. During the game, Mosquesda-Lewis scored her 2.000th point, two years after scoring her 1,000th point on Senior Day when she was a sophomore. The score was assisted by fellow senior Stokes, whose first block of the game was her 300th of her career, and led to a score, starting a 31–0 run to put the game out of reach.\nSouth Florida (away).\nThe South Florida team is solidly the second best in the American conference, a team that is likely to get a post-season bid and may do well there. However, there is still a gap between the best team in the conference and the second best team as epitomized by the 23-point win by the Huskies over the Bulls. Stewart had 29 points along with 11 rebounds, while setting a career high for blocks with seven. That over-shadowed Mosqueda-Lewis's fine performance, hitting another four three-pointers. The final score was 88–65.\nAmerican Athletic Conference tournament games.\nCincinnati (AAC).\nThe first game of the AAC tournament was against Cincinnati, a team coached by a former UConn player and assistant coach, but a team that UConn has beaten easily. This time would prove no different, as the Huskies won an easy victory 93–34. The game was more about individual goals, as Mosqueda-Lewis hit four three-pointers in her chase of the NCAA career record. Stokes recorded three blocks to reach 128 on the season, only three away from tying Rebecca Lobo's single season UConn record of 131.\nEast Carolina (AAC).\nThe second tournament game was against East Carolina. The game was never close, and the Huskies prevailed, 106–56. Stokes recorded four blocks to surpass Lobo and become the record holder for Career blocks at UConn. The Huskies shot 77% from the field in the first half, and ended the game with a 66% field goal shooting percentage.\nSouth Florida (AAC).\nUConn faced the Bulls for the Conference Championship. Although the Huskies won by 14 points 84–70, that is the smallest margin of victory in their conference games, and the smallest margin of victory outside the early season loss to Stanford. Mosqueda-Lewis scored 23 points to lead the Huskies to their second undefeated run through the American Athletic conference regular and post-season schedule.\nNCAA tournament championship.\nSt. Francis (Brooklyn).\nUConn's first opponent in the NCAA Tournament was St. Francis (Brooklyn). The Terriers earned a spot in the tournament by winning the Northeast Conference tournament. The Terriers were the #5 seed, so they played their first game on the road, and won, which matched them against the #1 seed Central Connecticut, in a game to be played on Central's home court. St. Francis won again, this time in double overtime. That placed them in the final, against Robert Morris on their home court. St. Francis won again, earning the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The “prize” was playing the top seeded team in the tournament. One of the St. Francis players was Sarah Benedetti, who grew up in Canton, CT following the UConn team before opting to play at St. Francis. She hit several three-pointers, and ended up with 13 points. However, the talent of the Huskies proved to be too much, as the UConn team hit over 70% of their shots, with Tuck scoring on 12 of her 13 attempts leading to a career-high 26 points. The final score in favor of the Huskies, was 89–33.\nRutgers.\nAfter the conference realignment, with Rutgers in the Big Ten Conference, the teams no longer automatically met in the regular season, but they were assigned to the same NCAA region, and met in the second round. The game did not start off like recent games have started. Stewart uncharacteristically picked up two early fouls and went to the bench. Some of the usual scorers were not scoring. Eventually, Mosqueda-Lewis took over and started an 11–0 run to open up the lead which would extend to 20 points by halftime. Early in the second half, the lead would stretch to 32, and the Huskies would go on to win and earn their 22nd consecutive trip to the Sweet 16.\nTexas.\nA coach often tells their team they will play better in the second half following a sub-par first half. Auriemma told his team at halftime “We’re going to play even better than that…Whatever that is, we’re going to find another gear in the second half.” However, the Huskies were leading by 28 points, 52–24, against Texas at the time of his prediction. Auriemma turned out to be correct, as the UConn lead extended out from 31 points to 42 points in under four minutes. The final margin of 51 points is the largest margin of victory in an NCAA regional or Final Four game. The win represented Auriemma's 100th NCAA victory. Stewart scored 31 points, and left the game with just over nine minutes remaining. Jefferson, a Texas native, scored a career-high 25 points.\nDayton.\nThe Huskies found themselves in unfamiliar territory at halftime of the regional final against Dayton—they were trailing, for the first time this season. The Dayton Flyers were no strangers to challenges; they had defeated both the #2 seed Kentucky and the #3 seed Louisville to set up the match against UConn. In the first half, the Flyers hit seven of their ten three-point attempts, led by Ally Malott, who hit all four she attempted. Auriemma adjusted the defense in the second half, effectively, as Malott would not score in the second half. The Huskies took the lead, extended it to eleven points, then out to 20 points. The final score was 91–70.\nMosqueda-Lewis hit a three-pointer to give her 392 in her career, setting a new record for the NCAA Division I.\nMaryland.\nOne game after setting the NCAA Division I career record for threes, Mosqueda-Lewis hit only a single basket in the game against Maryland, but when shots weren't falling, she passed to her teammates, recording seven assists. Tuck scored on ten of her 16 shots, totaling 24 points along with nine rebounds. Stewart scored 25, as Auriemma felt the Huskies had a post advantage against the guard-oriented Terrapins, so sought to push the ball inside. The plan worked, and UConn beat Maryland 81–58 to earn a place in the championship game.\nNotre Dame.\nThe Huskies defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida, to win their third consecutive NCAA championship. Breanna Stewart was voted Most Outstanding Player by the Associated Press. Coach Auriemma tied a record set by John Wooden by winning ten NCAA national championships.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002868; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Regular Season\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#808080;\"|2015 AAC tournament\n! colspan=12 style=\"background:#808080;\"|2015 NCAA women's tournament"

        "text": "At the end of each regular season, the Atlantic Sun Conference, branded since the 2016–17 school year as the ASUN Conference, names major award winners in baseball. Currently, it names a Coach, Pitcher, Player, Freshman, and Defensive Player of the Year. The Coach of the Year award, which dates to 1979, is the oldest. The others—Player (1982), Freshman (2001), Pitcher (2004), and Defensive Player (2014)—were added later. Through the 2001 season, the then-existing awards were known as the major awards of the Trans America Athletic Conference, the ASUN's former name.\nThrough the end of the 2019 season, Stetson has won 29 major awards, the most of any school in the conference.\nOn six occasions, a team has won swept the major awards given out in a season: Mercer in 1983, Georgia Southern in 1986 and 1987, Stetson in 1989, Florida International in 1995, and Florida Atlantic in 1999. All six instances came before 2001, when only the Coach and Player of the Year awards existed.\nFour individuals have won more than one of the awards. Mercer's Craig Gibson was named Player of the Year in 1985 and Coach of the Year in 2013; Mercer's Chesny Young was named Freshman of the Year in 2012 and Player of the Year in 2013; Jacksonville's Michael Baumann was Freshman of the Year and Pitcher of the Year in 2015; and Florida Gulf Coast's Jake Noll was Freshman of the Year in 2014 and Player of the Year in 2016.\nCoach of the Year.\nThe conference's Coach of the Year award is presented annually to the conference's most outstanding baseball coach, as chosen by a vote of ASUN coaches taken at the end of the regular season. From 1979–1981 and 1987–1992, the award was given automatically to the coach of the TAAC's tournament champion, rather than chosen by the league's coaches.\nThe award was first presented in 1979. From 1979–2001, it was known as the Trans America Athletic Conference Coach of the Year award, until the conference switched to its current name for the 2002 season.\nWith the exception of 2012, the award has been given to the coach of the league's regular season champion in each season since 2004. In 2012, USC Upstate's Matt Fincher was given the award after his team, picked to finish last, finished second in the ASUN.\nStetson's Pete Dunn, who has coached in the conference since 1986, has won the award six times, the most of any coach. He is one of three coaches to win the award in three straight years (1988–1990), along with Georgia Southern's Jack Stallings (1985–1987) and Florida Gulf Coast's Dave Tollett (2008–2010).\nWinners by season.\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first given out in 1979.\nWinners by school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose coaches have won the award, along with the first season each school played baseball in the conference, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so.\nBecause NCAA baseball is a spring sport, the first year of ASUN competition falls in the calendar year after each school formally joined the conference.\nPitcher of the Year.\nThe conference's Pitcher of the Year award is given annually to the best pitcher in the ASUN, as chosen by a vote of the conference's coaches at the end of the regular season. The award was first presented in 2004, prior to which pitchers were eligible for the Player of the Year Award.\nFive of the award's winners—Florida Gulf Coast's Richard Bleier and Chris Sale, Kennesaw State's Chad Jenkins, Stetson's Corey Kluber, and UCF's Matt Fox—have gone on to pitch in Major League Baseball.\nWinners by season.\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first awarded in 2004.\nWinners by school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose pitchers have won the award, along with the year each school first played ASUN baseball, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so.\nPlayer of the Year.\nThe conference's Player of the Year award is given annually to the best position player in the ASUN, as chosen by a vote of the conference's head coaches at the end of each regular season. It was first awarded in 1982. Until 2004, when the Pitcher of the Year award was instituted, both pitchers and position players were eligible. Before the conference was renamed, the award was known as the Trans America Athletic Conference Player of the Year award from 1982 to 2001.\nTwo players, both from Stetson, have won the award twice: shortstop Wes Weger in 1991 and 1992 and catcher Chris Westervelt in 2002 and 2004.\nFive of the award's winners—Florida Gulf Coast's Jake Noll, Georgia Southern's Todd Greene, Jacksonville's Daniel Murphy, and Stetson's George Tsamis and Kevin Nicholson—have gone on to appear in Major League Baseball.\nWinners by season.\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first awarded in 1982.\nWinners by school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose players have won the award, along with the season each school first played ASUN baseball, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so.\nFreshman of the Year.\nThe conference's Freshman of the Year award is given annually to the best freshman in the ASUN, as chosen by a vote of the conference's head coaches at the end of each regular season. It was first awarded in 2001. Since the ASUN did not change its name from the TAAC until after that season, the award was known as the Trans America Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year for one season.\nThree of the award's recipients—Florida Gulf Coast's Jake Noll, Lipscomb's Rex Brothers, and Stetson's Chris Johnson—went on to play in Major League Baseball.\nWinners by season.\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first awarded in 2001.\nWinners by school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose freshmen have won the award, along with the season each school first played ASUN baseball, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so.\nDefensive Player of the Year.\nThe conference began issuing the Defensive Player of the Year Award following the 2014 season.\nWinners by season.\nBelow is a table of the award's winners since it was first presented in 2014.\nWinners by school.\nThe following is a table of the schools whose players have won the award, along with the year in which each school first played ASUN baseball, the number of times it has won the award, and the years in which it has done so."

Members have playing rights over Elie Links, a UK Top 100 Golf Course.\nApproximately ten miles from the \"spiritual home of golf\" at St. Andrews, golf has been played over the links of Elie since the 1500s.\nThe clubhouse of the GHC is situated directly adjacent to the first tee. \nThe current course, a par 70 6251-yard course,\nwas largely designed by Old Tom Morris and James Braid in 1895.\nThe current club, the \"Golf House Club\", was founded in 1875 with the building of the clubhouse. An extension, the work of John Currie, was added in 1907. An unusual feature is the periscope from the Royal Navy submarine HMS \"Excalibur\", that was launched in 1955 and scrapped in 1968. The periscope is installed in the starter's hut; players and visitors may use it to view the golf course."

        "title": "St Andrews Golf Club",
        "text": "St Andrews Golf Club, originally known as St Andrews Mechanics Golf Club, is a private members’ golf club located in St Andrews, Scotland. The club is one of the oldest golf clubs in the world, having been established in 1843.\nThe club does not own its own golf course, instead, members use the seven public golf courses in St Andrews, who are owned by the St Andrews Links Trust, they include; the Balgove, Castle, Eden, Jubilee, New, Strathtyrum and the Old golf courses. The courses are all shared with members of the St Andrews Golf Club, members of the public, and also a number of local golf clubs, including the St Andrews Thistle Golf Club, The New Golf Club, the Old Course (15th century) Golf Club, the St Andrews International Golf Club, Strathtyrum Golf Club, Jubilee Course Golf Club, St Regulus Ladies Golf Club, The St Rule Club, and The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.\nFormer members of the club have won The Open Championship, including Old Tom Morris and Young Tom Morris who both won the title on four occasions each. In total 11 members have won the title with 20 victories.\nHistory.\nThe St Andrews Golf Club was established by 11 local tradesmen on 29 September 1843 as the St Andrews Mechanics Golf Club. The founding members were: William Ayton (Cabinet maker), John Keddie (Joiner), George Morris (Butler) elder brother of Old Tom Morris, Alexander Bruce (Cabinet maker), John Lynn (Tailor), Robert Patterson (Slater), Alexander Carstairs (Cabinet maker), Adam McPherson (Plasterer), David Todd Junior (Painter), James Herd (Mason), and James McPherson (Dancing Master).\nIn 1851 it was proposed by the then club captain, James Howie, that the club should change its name to St Andrews Golf Club or similar name. On 22 September 1853, the \"Fifeshire Journal\" reported that the Mechanics Golf Club had changed its name to the St Andrews Golf Club. In the second half of the 19th century the St Andrews Golf Club was the strongest golf club in Scotland, with members such as Allan Robertson, he is generally regarded as being the best golfer in Scotland from 1843 until his death. However he never had the chance to play in The Open Championship. When Robertson died, no one knew who the best golfer was, and so a tournament was born to determine the name of the champion golfer of the year.\nOther members included Old Tom Morris, who was a long-time member\nof the club, Young Tom Morris and many others, who built the club's reputation in challenge matches, the early Open Championships and team games. The following members won 18 Open Championships in the 19th century, and a further 2 in the 20th century: Old Tom Morris (1861, 1862, 1864, 1867), Young Tom Morris (1868, 1969, 1870, 1972), Tom Kidd (1873), Bob Martin (1876, 1885), Jamie Anderson (1877, 1878, 1879), Willie Fernie (1883), Jack Burns (1888), Hugh Kirkaldy (1891), William Auchterlonie (1893), Sandy Herd (1902), and Jock Hutchison (1921). Club members have also won U.S. Open titles too, with James Foulis (1896), Fred Herd (1898) and Laurie Auchterlonie (1902).\nAllan Robertson and Old Tom Morris of the St Andrews Golf Club were an intimidating challenging team, occasionally called \"the invincibles\". Large sums of money for the matches was put up by sponsors, with the players who won also getting a percentage, but they also made their own bets too. Team matches are a tradition within the St Andrews Golf Club. The first match that was arranged was against Leven in 1849 with teams of 6 players on each side.\nThe clubhouse.\nHistorically golfing societies and clubs would normally meet in either a local hotel or member's house close to the golf course. Official clubhouses became popular in Scotland from the mid-nineteenth century as the game's popularity increased. The St Andrews Golf Club's first purchased a clubhouse in 1905 in nearby Golf Place. In 1932, the club decided to purchase Links House for £2,700. It cost a further £2,000 to convert it to a clubhouse. The new clubhouse was officially opened on 20 July 1933. It was built at the end of the 19th century, and overlooks the 18th green on the Old Course at St Andrews and across from the Royal and Ancient clubhouse. It was listed as a Grade C building on 12 December 2001. \nThe club has used Links House as their clubhouse since 1933.\nMembership.\nMembership of the club has grown over the years from 11 at its foundation in 1843, to 535 in 1927, 1,013 in 1947 and to over 2,000 members in 1998. The main fee that is required to pay to become a member is $200,000 and after that first fee there is an annual payment of $28,100. This fee seems very expensive but it does not compare to Liberty National Golf Club that has an initial payment of $500,000. \nHonorary members.\nBobby Jones became an honorary member in 1958. He was a winner of 13 major golf championships and the only man to have won the Grand Slam, winning the U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur, the British Open, and the British Amateur Championship all in the same year of 1930.\nJack Nicklaus became an honorary member during the 1978 Open Championship whilst he was still halfway through the event at St Andrews. He is the winner of 18 major golf championships, including 3 Open titles, 4 U.S. Open titles, 6 Masters titles, and 5 U.S. PGA Championship titles.\nSir Michael Bonallack became an honorary member in 1990 having won the Amateur Championship on fives occasions and \nPaul Lawrie became an Honorary member on 6 October 1999 having won the Open Championship in the same year at Carnoustie Golf Links.\nName of the club.\nDuring its existence there have been slight differences in the club's name:\nExternal links.\n "

Each tournament has players competing in games of the latest incarnation of the \"FIFA\" association football video game series. The open qualifying format allows millions to compete in the initial online stages, which has resulted in the FIWC being recognized as the largest online esports game by Guinness World Records.\nThe most recent champion is Manuel Bachoore from the Netherlands.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural FIWC took place in 2004 in Switzerland, over the years the tournament has grown significantly. In 2010, the FIWC first appeared in the Guinness World Records – but it was not until 2013 that the competition saw the current record of more than 2.5 million players signing up.\nOn 1 October 2015, the FIWC 16 kicked off, marking the 12th edition of the tournament. For the first time in the history of the competition Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players competed against each other. With the integration of the new consoles the number of participants increased significantly, compared to previous years when the FIWC was only available on PlayStation 3. 2.3 million players attempted to qualify for the Grand Final in New York City. On 22 March 2016, Mohamad Al-Bacha from Denmark won the FIWC title in the Apollo Theater, beating Sean Allen from England in the final match.\nIn 2018, the FIFA Interactive World Cup (FIWC) was renamed to the FIFA eWorld Cup (FeWC). The 2018 Grand Finals was held between 2 August 2018 through 4 August 2018 in the O2 Arena in London, England. 32 finalists (16 on PlayStation 4 and 16 on Xbox One) competed in the group stage and round of 16 on 2 August 2018, with the second leg of the round of 16 and the quarterfinals taking place on 3 August 2018. The semi-finals and final took place on 4 August 2018.\nIn October 2020, the FIFA eWorld Cup was rebranded as the FIFAe World Cup as part of FIFA's launch of its FIFAe esports tournament series.\nDue to EA and FIFA not renewing their licensing agreement after \"FIFA 23\", the 2023 FIFAe World Cup was the last edition involving EA's football video game series. EA themselves announced a replacement tournament circuit known as EA Sports FC Pro to coincide with the series rebranding to EA Sports FC starting with \"EAFC 24\", with its world championship to be known as the EA Sports FC Pro World Championship.\nFormat.\nOnline qualification.\nThe FeWC online qualification takes place on PlayStation and Xbox Networks, and can be accessed through the latest version of EA Sports FIFA on Xbox One and PS4. The players qualify via the console playoffs where the top 16 players make it through to the eWorld Cup finals. Players can also qualify for the FeWC by competing in one of the FIFA Global Series tournaments throughout the season, with the top 16 at the last event automatically qualifying for the FeWC.\nIn the 2022 edition, games are only played on PlayStation 5 console. 128 players are selected for the FIFA Global Series Playoffs including 74 qualified via Regional Global Series Ranking and 54 qualified via Partner Leagues.\nGrand Finals.\n32 players compete at the Grand Finals of the FeWC. The participants are divided into four groups (two for each console) with the top 16 players moving on to the knockout stage. While Group stage, Round of 16, Quarter-finals and Semi-finals are played on one console (Xbox One or PS4), the Final is a two-leg match with one game on each console. The Grand Final is a multi-day event with draw and competition being broken up into three days. The winner is crowned in a live show at the end of the event.\nIn the 2022 edition, games are only played on PlayStation 5 console. Before the 2022 edition, matches in Group Stage are two-leg match in a single round robin format; it was changed into single game double round robin from 2022 on.\nWorld ranking.\nIn 2016, the FIFA Interactive World Cup World Ranking was introduced to help seed the players in the tournament according to their previous results. The ranking takes into account both the qualification phase for the current edition and previous FeWC Grand Finals.\nPrize fund.\nThe FeWC 2018 champion received $250,000 in prize money and a ticket to the Best FIFA Awards where he has the chance to meet the greatest of the real football world. FIWC 2015 Champion Abdulaziz Alshehri from Saudi Arabia was able to meet Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi among many others, while 2016 champion Mohammad Al-Bacha talked to Marcelo Vieira and Manuel Neuer.\nThe runner-up of the 2018 FeWC Grand Final receives $50,000 in prize money.\nThe Champions of FIFAe World Cup 2023 receives $300,000 in prize money.\nBroadcast.\nThe FeWC Grand Finals is streamed live on YouTube and Twitch. For the first time, the Final Showdown of the FIWC16 was also broadcast on TV. The broadcast was shown in more than 100 countries around the world. Fox Sports 1 showed the Final live in the United States. \nThe show was moderated by host Kay Murray. Former US footballer Alexi Lalas and Spencer Carmichael-Brown (Spencer FC) analyzed the matches, Leigh Smith and John Strong commentated the games.

        "text": "Baseball was introduced in the Philippines during the American colonial period. Baseball was a national pastime in the country. The sport has become a re-emerging sport in the recent years. National policy and programs on baseball are, since 2018, directed by a renewed organization recognized by the Philippine Sports Commission and the Philippine Olympic Committee—the Philippine Amateur Baseball Association (PABA), reestablished the same year.\nEarly history.\nBaseball was introduced in the Philippines by the Americans. The first baseball game in the Philippines was played in September 1898 weeks after the Battle of Manila, a match between Astor Battery led by George Wetlaufer and a regiment from the American Army. From 1899 to 1900, baseball clubs were established by local Filipinos. The sport's introduction aided the American colonial government's assimilation efforts. General Otis planned to eliminate local cockfighting through the introduction of the sport. A baseball league composing of six clubs was established. Then, Governor General William Howard Taft encouraged baseball in the archipelago. Baseball grew to be a popular sport in the country.\nArlie Pond was instrumental to the growth of baseball in the country.\nBaseball's popularity saw a decline from 1898 to 1923 because of claims of neglect by the Department of Public Instruction. Prior to 1998, sporting officials claimed that the department, through the Bureau of Education, had supported baseball in the country with the goal of eliminating cockfighting in the country. Teachers who were brought from the United States to the country had no experience in baseball and even in basic athletics. The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation favored indoor baseball over its outdoor counterpart. In 1923, the Manila League was the only flourishing league in the country.\nLate 20th century.\nBaseball experienced a boost when the Philippines hosted the first Asian Baseball Championship in 1954 and emerged as champions in the inaugural tournament. Bobby Balcena became the first player of Filipino descent to play in the Major League Baseball in 1956. Baseball continued to be a popular sport up to the mid 1970s. Political conflict among baseball officials led to the decline of the sports in the country. Basketball eventually gained popularity over baseball.\nFrom 1971 to 1994, the Philippines did not take part in any international competition. Baseball suffered from lack of financial support and a decrease of baseball venues. There was also a lack of coverage on television on the sport.\n21st century.\nSince 2005, the Philippine baseball became a re-emerging sport finishing just behind the three Asian baseball powerhouses. The Philippines became a powerhouse in the ASEAN region and has developed rivalries with Thailand and Indonesia. As part of a growing national revival, the professional Baseball Philippines league was established in 2007, but lasted for 5 years. The league was in 2019 replaced with a brand new league, the Philippine Baseball League (PBL), with a mix of school and corporate teams. In recent years the country's youth baseball contingents have played in the Little League Baseball regional and international qualifiers as well as in other competitions abroad, and have brought not just national prestige, but also increased interest in the sport among Filipinos, reinforced in the mid-2010s with the broadcasts of the Japanese anime series \"Major\" and \"Ace of Diamond\" on digital TV channel Yey!, which also doubled up its popularity among the young that now almost every city in the country has a baseball presence, as well as a rising number of public and private elementary and high schools have a youth baseball team, with amateur baseball teams now in the upswing in almost every corner of the country.\nTo reach out to Filipinos abroad, Canadian TV channel OMNI Television began airing Filipino language broadcasts of Toronto Blue Jays games on CJMT-DT beginning August 2018 for Toronto's Filipino community. This is the very first time that baseball has been aired on television in the Filipino language to serve Filipino baseball fans in Canada, there are currently no Filipino-language radio and television broadcasts of the other 29 MLB teams in the United States as of present, nor even Filipino-language broadcasts aired in television channels in the Philippines. However, MLB games do air in the country via cable and satellite, as well as on the league's Youtube channel via the Youtube Game of the Week.\nUnknown to Filipinos at home but known among the Filipino-American baseball fans in the US itself is the fact that there are already players in active playing duties in the MLB whose parents are of Filipino origin, for example, Addison Russell (currently of the Chicago Cubs) and Tim Lincecum (as of present a free agent and formerly of the Texas Rangers). As of November 2018, an alumnus of the Philippine Little League baseball teams, Farhan Zaidi, is the current president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants, having grew up in the Philippines and began to play the game when he was a kid."

        "title": "2014 Wimbledon Championships – Men's singles final",
        "text": "The 2014 Wimbledon Championships Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2014 Wimbledon Championships. A significant part of the Djokovic–Federer rivalry, it pitted Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer against each other in a Grand Slam final for the second time. The match marks the only time that Federer lost a Wimbledon final after winning the first set.\nAfter 3 hours and 56 minutes, top seed Djokovic defeated fourth-seeded Federer in five sets to win the match. By winning the 2014 Wimbledon Championships, Djokovic not only won for the second time, but also reclaimed the world number one ranking from Rafael Nadal at the conclusion of the tournament.\nBackground.\nThe match took place on the final day of the 2014 edition of the 13-day Wimbledon Championships, held every June and July. Novak Djokovic was world number two entering Wimbledon, but was seeded first ahead of Rafael Nadal due to Wimbledon employing a grass-court seeding system that took into account recent results on grass. Djokovic had reached the semifinals in 2012 and final in 2013, whilst Nadal had fallen in the second and first rounds respectively. Roger Federer, on the other hand, entered the Championships ranked and seeded fourth, and reached the final after having been upset by Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second round in 2013.\nDjokovic had to overcome numerous tough matches to reach the final: he was almost pushed to five sets by Radek Štěpánek in the second round, was two sets to one down against Marin Čilić in the quarterfinals before rallying to win in five sets and also required four sets to defeat Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals. By contrast, Federer only dropped a set (and his own serve) once to reach the final, in the quarterfinals against Stan Wawrinka.\nGoing into the final, Federer had not contested a major final since two years prior when he won Wimbledon in 2012. In 2013, affected by back troubles, Federer had failed to reach any of the major finals for the first time since 2002 and some commentators doubted whether he would ever contest a major final again. When asked if he felt that he could still win a major, Federer responded, \"I'm just really pleased that I'm back strong at Wimbledon. Last year I didn't even come close. I was very deflated leaving Wimbledon on that note. I'm happy I'm sort of physically back where I can put myself in contention.\" Upon reaching the final, Federer was bidding to win his 80th career title, 18th major overall and eighth Wimbledon title, which would have broken the record that he shared with Pete Sampras for the most Wimbledon men's singles titles at seven.\nDjokovic too had not won a major since the 2013 Australian Open over a year and a half prior, and was going into the final having lost five of the previous six major finals he had contested. He entered the championship match looking for his second Wimbledon title after winning in 2011, and was seeking redemption after losing in the previous year's final to Andy Murray. Djokovic stated, \"There is plenty of motivation from my side to win this Grand Slam final after losing last three out of four. It would mean a lot mentally for me.\" As a result of the circumstances, both men relished the challenge and were focused on playing a high-quality match.\nMatch.\nNovak Djokovic won the coin toss and elected to serve first. The first set saw neither player force a break point, though there were a few games that went to deuce. A tiebreak was required to decide the first set and it saw Federer come from two separate set points down to take it 9–7. At 51 minutes, the first set alone lasted just four minutes less than the entire women's singles final.\nDespite falling early in the second set, Djokovic managed to break Federer's serve early in the third game. The set remained on serve from there and Djokovic leveled the match at one-set all. The lone break of serve in the second set was only the second time all tournament that Federer had been broken. The third set followed a similar pattern to that of the first; again a tiebreak was required to decide it as neither man would yield his serve, and it was Djokovic who would win the set and go two-sets-to-one up. After three sets, neither man was giving anything away as the unforced errors remained very low. Federer's serving kept him in the match but he had still been unable to gain even a single break point opportunity as Djokovic's own serving display continued to hold up strong.\nIn the fourth set, Djokovic again broke early to lead 3–1. From there, Federer broke Djokovic's serve for the first time in match to get back on serve at 3–2; only to be broken again in his service game which saw Djokovic regain the lead at 4–2. Djokovic consolidated his break this time to take a commanding 5–2 lead and was a game away from the title, leaving Federer to serve to stay in the match. After Federer held serve in the eighth game, Djokovic served for the win at 5–3 and seemed poised to win the title in four sets. Federer would come back from the brink of defeat to break Djokovic for the second time and put the set back on serve. Then, in the tenth game, Djokovic earned a championship point, which Federer saved with an ace which was initially called out but ruled in after a successful challenge by the Hawk-Eye review system. Federer then levelled the set at 5–5 and from there, he broke Djokovic again for the third time in the set and then held his serve to win five games in a row and claim the fourth set 7–5. The Wimbledon final went to a fifth set for the first time since 2009.\nDjokovic served to begin the fifth. Both men held serve comfortably until 3–3, when Federer was able to muster a break point but could not convert it after a long rally. Djokovic was able to hold and go ahead 4–3, and in the next game, found himself at 15–40 with 2 break points. Federer fought them off to level the match at 4–4. In the next game, Federer sent an overhead smash into the net that would have given him a 15–30 opening had he made it. Djokovic pounced on the error to hold serve and go ahead 5–4. Finally in the tenth game, Djokovic earned another two championship points after Federer sent a forehand long at 15–30. There was no ace this time as Federer faulted on championship point and was forced into a second serve. Djokovic took control of the ensuing rally and won Wimbledon after Federer netted a backhand to conclude the contest.\nOfficials.\nThe chair umpire throughout the match was British official James Keothavong. He umpired his first ever Grand Slam singles final.\nReaction.\nLasting for 3 hours and 56 minutes, the match was played at a relatively fast pace with both players serving well until the final game. Many rallies in the contest went over 20 shots. During the third set, Djokovic went over 30 minutes without hitting a single error.\nFederer's winners to unforced errors differential was +46, while Djokovic's was +41. Djokovic said \"Sincerely, this has been the best quality Grand Slam final that I have ever been part of. I've had a longest final against Nadal in the Australian Open, but quality-wise from the first to last point, this is definitely the best match. It's the most special Grand Slam final I've played.\"\nFederer said \"It was a great match and I enjoyed being a part of it. Winning or losing, it's always something special in the Wimbledon final and something you'll remember, even more so when the match was as dramatic as it was today. I'm very pleased with the way things went throughout the match. It was a high-quality match and it was good stuff from both players. Clearly we both walk away happy from here. I mean, him more happy than I am. But still, I'm happy overall.\"\nRetired tennis player Jimmy Connors was present for the match as a commentator for BBC Sport. Connors said \"I loved this match because there was more to it than just tennis. For four hours neither player wanted to give an inch. Sometimes there's a lull in matches that go five sets, but I didn't think there was a lull today at all. Both players came out and gave it the punch right from the start. It was one of those days when you say, \"I'm happy to be here just to see this.\"\nStatistics.\nSource"

He wanted to construct a course on his land and enrolled the help of three friends. Leslie Balfour-Melville, Robert Maxwell and Norman Mitchell Innes helped layout the course at Erskine in 1901. Baird then encouraged Willie Fernie (open champion 1883) to develop the course into 18 holes between 1903-4.\nThe course opened on Saturday 12 March 1904. An exhibition match was played between Willie Fernie and Ben Sayers. Later in the year a meeting was held in Bishopton Primary School and the club was established. Baird became the first captain and in 1905 built the clubhouse, furnished it and maintained at his own expense.\nThe club managed to carry on through World War I and in 1920 enlisted the help of Dr Alister MacKenzie to redesign the 12th and 13th holes. In homage these holes are named after their designer.\nJames Braid (five times open champion) redesigned the course in 1937. He added new bunkers and holes and improvements to the design of the greens. This is the course as it is today."

        "text": "This is a record of the Czech Republic's results at the FIFA World Cup, including those of Czechoslovakia which is considered as both the Czech Republic's and Slovakia's predecessor by FIFA. The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently takes place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nCzechoslovakia has been one of the better performing national teams in the history of the World Cup, having ended twice as runners-up, in 1934 and in 1962. Between 1930 and 1994 they qualified for 8 out of 13 World Cups they played qualifiers for, and did not enter in two other World Cups.\nAfter the political and peaceful split-up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the official successor football teams of Czech Republic and Slovakia have been less successful at the World Cup than Czechoslovakia, qualifying only for one out of the seven tournaments held since (the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2010 FIFA World Cup) without surviving the group phase and got eliminated in the last 16 respectively.\nThroughout the World Cup history, Brazil became the team's historical rival. The two countries have met each other five times but the Czechs and Slovaks (always Czechoslovakia) never managed to win, with three victories for the Brazilian side and two draws. Two other historical opponents in the finals were (West) Germany and Italy with three encounters each: Czechoslovakia won, drew and lost once against the Germans and the matches against Italy all ended in a defeat.\nAwards.\nTeam Awards\nIndividual Awards"

        "title": "Connecticut PGA Championship",
        "text": "The Connecticut PGA Championship is a golf tournament that is a championship of the Connecticut section of the PGA of America. The early years of the tournament were dominated by Gene Kunes and Joe Turnesa who won twice apiece. In the mid-1930s, a number of significant changes were made, including adding two rounds to the tournament and then changing the format to match play. In the mid-20th century the tournament was dominated by Eddie Burke and Bob Kay. During this era, both won the tournament five times each though Kay defeated Burke in both of their finals matches. In modern times, the tournament is best known for the 2002 victory of Suzy Whaley, the only female to win the event.\nHistory.\nThe first tournament was in 1929. Late in the day, the clubhouse leaders entered a playoff to determine the championship. Unbeknownst to them, Maurice Kearney was still on the course with a chance to win. While he was on the 18th hole, he notified the players in the playoff, who were playing on the first hole, that he had a chance to win outright. Kearney did indeed win outright and \"the playoff\" was terminated. The following year George Siebert won the event defeating Peter Manning, who was also runner-up the previous year, in a playoff.\nIn the early 1930s, the tournament was dominated by Gene Kunes and Joe Turnesa. Kunes won the tournament in 1931 and 1933. In 1935, Turnesa was the \"leader most of the way\" and ultimately won by five shots. His final total was 145, one-under-par, to break the tournament record. The following year, as defending champion, he was considered to be the favorite. However, it was Willie Hunter who took the lead after the first three rounds. He led by four over Turnesa entering the final round. However, in the final round Turnesa birdied the first two holes and the tournament suddenly \"cracked wide open\" when Hunter triple-bogeyed the par-5 5th hole. Hunter continued to struggle and Turnesa expanded his lead. Despite bogeys on the final four holes Turnesa won easily.\nIt was later decided that the tournament would be moved up a couple months earlier, in August. In April 1936, the Connecticut Section PGA made a number of changes. The \"most important decision,\" according to the \"The Hartford Courant\", was to extend the Connecticut PGA Championship to 72 holes. The following year, in 1937, the tournament took a \"radical departure\" and changed its format to match play. In May 1941, however, the Connecticut PGA decided to return to a medal play format.\nIn the late 1940s, the tournament was dominated by Eddie Burke and Harry Nettelbladt. Burke won the tournament in 1945 and 1946. In 1947, Harry Nettelbladt scored rounds of 73 and 71 to win. The following year, Burke led the qualifiers while Nettelbladt finished second. Both players made it to the finals. In the morning round of the finals, Burke \"coasted\" with a 71 (−2) to take a 5 up lead. During the afternoon round, however, Nettelbladt produced a \"sensational performance,\" ultimately scoring a 65 (−8) and tying the match. After halving the first extra hole, however, Nettelbladt took four shots to reach the green of the par-4 38th hole. He made bogey to lose to Burke. Two years later, in the finals, Burke \"set an all time record\" defeating Frank Staszowski 12 &amp; 11.\nIn the 1950s, the tournament was dominated by Bob Kay, a professional at Wampanoag Country Club. In 1953, he made it to the finals. Kay took a 5 up lead in the morning round however Burke tied him during the afternoon's back nine. Kay, however, won the 15th and 16th holes to secure the match and championship. He won 2 &amp; 1. Kay won the tournament again in 1956 and 1959. In 1960, Kay qualified for the finals but was expected \"to face tough going\" against Eddie Burke. It was the second time they met in the finals, the first in seven years. Both were intending to win their fourth title. Kay \"got off to a strong start\" and took a 6 up lead after only 8 holes. Over the course of the rest of the match, however, Burke \"slowly but surely whittled Kay's lead down.\" Entering the final hole of regulation, he was only 1 down. However, Burke failed to make the green in regulation and conceded the hole. Kay won 1 up.\nIn the early 1960s, there were some changes. In 1961, the tournament returned to medal play. The following year the tournament returned to Connecticut after having been held in Massachusetts the previous year.\nSome controversy exists regarding the winner of the 2002 Championship, Suzy Whaley. By winning the Connecticut PGA that year, she became the first woman in 58 years to qualify for a PGA event, the Greater Hartford Open. The controversy had to do with the fact that she was allowed to play the course off tees 699 yards shorter than the men she competed against. This discrepancy has since been addressed by the PGA with what's commonly called the \"Whaley Rule\".\nWinners.\nSource:"

They played 35 first-class friendly matches, usually one match per season, between March 1949 and January 1990.\nMatches.\nSouth African Universities played their first first-class match in 1948–49 against the touring MCC, who won by an innings. Their next first-class match was also against the MCC, in 1956–57, and ended with the same result. David Pithey took 5 for 100 in the MCC innings.\nThey won their next match, in 1957–58 against North Eastern Transvaal, when Colin Bland scored 131 on his first-class debut and Pithey and Peter van der Merwe shared most of the wickets. Later that season they drew their match against the Australians, Tony Pithey scoring 126 and his brother David taking 5 for 105.\nFrom 1960–61 – when Glen Hall took 4 for 24 and 9 for 122 (South African Universities' best innings and match figures) on his first-class debut, and Colin Bland scored 124 and Eric Brotherton scored 164 not out (South African Universities' highest individual score) to defeat Western Province by an innings – South African Universities played annually, usually against a provincial team, and usually in early December. In their seven matches against provincial teams in the 1960s they won four: twice against Western Province, once against Transvaal, and once against Orange Free State.\nFrom June to August 1967 South African Universities toured England, playing 21 matches, of which they won ten and lost only one. Two matches were first-class, against Cambridge University, which was drawn, and Oxford University, which South African Universities won by an innings.\nIn the 1970s South African Universities played 10 matches, all of them against provincial teams, winning two and losing six. In the match against Western Province in 1978–79, the Universities won by scoring 500 for 7 in the fourth innings. Adrian Kuiper top-scored with 110 not out, after taking 6 for 96 in the first innings.\nThey played nine matches from 1980–81 to 1989–90, losing four and drawing five. Several matches were close, however: they lost to Northern Transvaal by four runs in 1980–81 and had the better of draws against Border in 1983–84, the Australian XI in 1985–86 and the England XI in 1989–90, which was South African Universities' last first-class match.\nOf their 35 first-class matches, South African Universities won eight, lost 16 and drew 11.\nTest players.\nMany South African Universities players went on to play Test cricket. Of the team in the first match in 1949, Jack Nel, John Waite, Anton Murray, Ian Smith and Cuan McCarthy all went on to play Tests. Six future Test players – Tony Pithey, Derek Varnals, Colin Wesley, David Pithey, Peter van der Merwe and Clive Halse – were in the team in 1956–57. From the last match in 1990, Andrew Hudson, Hansie Cronje, Clive Eksteen and Tertius Bosch all played Test cricket."

This was the 39th consecutive year that the tournament had been held at the Crucible, and it was the 47th successive world championship to be contested through the knockout format after reverting from a challenge match system in the 1960s.\nThe top 16 players in the world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Selby was seeded first overall as the defending champion, and the remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the world rankings, released after the penultimate event of the season, the China Open. The number of frames needed to win a match increased with each proceeding round of the main draw, starting with best-of-19-frames matches in the first round, leading up to the final which was played as a best-of-35-frames match.\nPrize fund.\nThe prize fund of the event was raised to £1,364,000 from the previous year's £1,214,000. The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nParticipant summary.\nThe event featured 144 participants, 128 competing in qualifying alongside 16 invited players. The top 16 seeds automatically qualified for the main draw based on the snooker world rankings before the tournament. Ali Carter was seeded 13, despite being ranked 31, because his seeding had been frozen while he underwent treatment for cancer. This meant that Michael White, ranked 16, had to play in the qualifying tournament. For the first time, players ranked 17 to 32 had to win three qualifying matches, rather than one.\nTen former world champions competed in the tournament. Peter Ebdon, Steve Davis, and Ken Doherty lost in the qualifying rounds, but Graeme Dott qualified for the main stages. Six other former champions (John Higgins, Shaun Murphy, Ronnie O'Sullivan, Neil Robertson, Mark Selby, and Mark Williams) automatically qualified by virtue of their top 16 rankings. Davis became the first player to compete in a total of 100 World Championship matches, including qualifiers, as he lost 1–10 to Kurt Maflin. Ten-time women's world champion Reanne Evans attempted to become the first woman to reach the televised stages of the World Championship, but she lost 8–10 to Doherty in the first qualifying round.\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played as the best of 19 frames held over two between 18 and 23 April. First-round debutants at the championship were England's Craig Steadman, and Stuart Carrington, Scotland's Anthony McGill, and Norway's Kurt Maflin. McGill and Carrington had both played at the Crucible before, in the Junior Pot Black in 2006. Mark Selby led 6–3 and 8–4 against Maflin, but trailed after his opponent won five frames in a row. Selby recovered from 8–9 down to clinch a 10–9 win. In his match against Steadman, O'Sullivan risked a sanction for removing a pair of uncomfortable shoes and playing briefly in his socks, before borrowing a replacement pair of shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. Carter, who had missed the first five months of the season after extensive treatment for cancer, won his match 10–5 against Alan McManus.\nHiggins recorded seven breaks over 50 in a 10–5 victory over Robert Milkins. McGill led Maguire 9–5, and took the with a break of 122 after Maguire had won four successive frames to level at 9–9. Marco Fu and Jimmy Robertson were tied at 5–5, Fu winning five of the next six frames for a 10–6 win. Mark Davis built a 4–0 lead against Ding Junhui, but won only three out of the next thirteen, and lost 7–10. Mark Allen, trailing 1–3, took the next nine frames to progress 10–3 at the expense of Day. Hawkins led Matthew Selt 7–2 and 9–4, but had to win the match in a deciding frame as Selt won the next five frames. Stevens, who had been defeated in the 2000 final by Williams, eliminated Williams at the 2015 event, completing a 10–2 victory.\nZhang Anda, who at 98th in the rankings was the lowest ranked qualifier, lost the first seven frames in his match against Joe Perry. He won only four frames, and lost 4–10. Neil Robertson compiled a 143 in the third frame of his 10–2 defeat of Jamie Jones. Murphy, who declared that he was planning to take an attacking approach to matches, as he had in winning the 2005 tournament, won 10–3 against Hull. Robbie Williams led 5–4 against Stuart Bingham after their first session, which featured breaks over 50 in each of the frames, but lost 7–10. Dott defeated Ricky Walden 10–8 after the pair had been level at 4–4 and 7–7. Judd Trump completed a 10–6 win against Carrington with a break of 109 in the 16th frame.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions between 23 and 27 April. Selby and McGill were tied at 4–4 after their opening session, but McGill led 10–6 after the second. He later won the match 13–9, making Selby the 16th first-time champion who failed to defend his title since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977, succumbing to what has become known as the 'Crucible curse'. Ding lost five of the first six frame in his match against Higgins but won the match 13–9 to reach only his third quarter-final in nine years. Higgins praised Ding's positional play after the match, crediting it as the best since Steve Davis.\nBarry Hawkins trailed Allen 8–11, but won five straight frames to win the match 13–11. Allen commented that his opponent \"froze [him] out\", and Hawkins suggested the win would strengthen him going forward. Bingham reached his second Crucible quarter-final, winning seven out of the last eight frames to defeat Dott 13–5. Three of the other four-second round matches ended with 13–5 wins for O'Sullivan over Matthew Stevens, Murphy over Perry, and Robertson over Carter. Judd Trump defeated Fu 13–8. Robertson compiled a break of 145 in the last frame of his match against Carter.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 28 and 29 April, as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions. Trump defeated Ding 13–4 after leading 6–2 and 12–4 after the first two sessions to reach his third World Championship semi-final. He commented that \"he won't get beaten\" if he continued to play in the same manner for the rest of the tournament. Murphy led the last remaining qualifier McGill 9–7, and won four of the next five to win 13–8 and reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2009. Bingham made the joint highest break of the tournament in the quarter-final match against O'Sullivan. He reached the first career semi-final after completing 13–9 victory over tournament favourite O'Sullivan, who had beaten Bingham 13–4 at the same stage of the tournament two years before. A controversial incident occurred in the fifth frame of the match, when O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Referee Terry Camilleri did not penalise O'Sullivan, even though the rules of snooker call for a seven-point foul if a player uses an object to measure gaps or distances. The referee's handling of the incident was questioned from the commentary box by former world champion Doherty and on Twitter by former tour referee Michaela Tabb. Bingham commented that he had been in tears after the match, calling it \"unbelievable\".\nIn the last quarter-final match, Hawkins defeated Robertson 13–12 to reach the semi-finals for a third consecutive year. Hawkins and Robertson produced four century breaks each to equal the record of eight centuries in one match, a new record for a 25-frame match. Their encounter also included the longest frame in the 2015 tournament to that point, at 70 minutes and 22 seconds.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played between 30 April and 2 May, as the best of 33 frames, held over four sessions. All four world championship semi-finalists were English, of whom, Murphy was the only former winner of the event to reach the last four. Murphy took a 6–2 lead over Hawkins in the first session and extended it to 13–3 after the second. Hawkins won the third session, taking five out of eight frames, but trailed 16–8. Murphy wrapped up a 17–9 victory in the final session to reach the third world championship final of his career, after 2005 and 2009. Murphy commented that he was \"blown away\" at reaching the final of the event again. With five century breaks from Murphy and three from Hawkins, the match equalled the record for the most centuries in a professional match at the Crucible.\nIn a much closer encounter, Bingham led Trump 5–3 after the first session, 9–7 after the second, and 13–11 after the third. From 14 to 16 down, Trump produced two consecutive century breaks to force a deciding frame. Trump had the first chance in the final frame, but suffered a allowing Bingham to prevail and defeat Trump 17–16 and reach his first World Championship final. Bingham commented \"\"It's unbelievable, I cant believe I'm in the world final\" Trump commented that despite Bingham playing well, it was \"tough to take, really. I needed one good chance. If I'd missed the pot normally then fair play but the kick threw it off line... I feel it's been a little bit taken away from me.\"\nFinal.\nThe final was held on 3 and 4 May as the best of 35 frames, across four sessions. At the age of 38, Bingham was the oldest first-time finalist at the Crucible since 45-year-old Ray Reardon in 1978, although Reardon had already won five world titles at other venues by that point in his career. It was the third appearance in the final for Murphy, who won the title in 2005 with an 18–16 victory over Stevens and was runner-up in 2009 when he lost 9–18 to Higgins. The final was refereed for the first time by Olivier Marteel, from Koksijde in West Flanders, Belgium, who had previously officiated on the semi-final the previous year. He was also the first Belgian to take charge of a World Championship final, and the second referee from continental Europe to do so, after Jan Verhaas.\nTo open the final, Murphy took a 3–0 lead, but Bingham fought back to end the session all-square at 4–4. In the second session of nine frames, Murphy began strongly, winning four consecutive frames to move 8–4 ahead, but Bingham won four of the next five to reduce Murphy's lead to 9–8 overnight. Bingham's break of 123 in the 14th frame was the 84th century break compiled at the Crucible in 2015, breaking the previous record of 83 centuries set in 2009. In the third session, Bingham won six of the eight frames to move into a 14–11 lead. In the 20th frame, Bingham attempted a maximum break, potting 14 reds and 14 blacks before missing the final red. Although Murphy won four of the first five frames in the final session to draw level at 15–15, Bingham won the 64-minute 31st frame to go 16–15 in front, and then added two more frames for an 18–15 victory and his first world title.\nBingham had odds of 50–1 to win before the tournament. The achievement made him the oldest player to win the title since Reardon in 1978. He was the third oldest winner in Crucible history after Reardon in 1978 and John Spencer who was 41 in 1977. Winning the title also took him to a career high of second in the world rankings. The final was noted for its high standard of break-building, with 6 centuries and 24 more over 50 in the 33 frames played.\nMain draw.\nShown below are the results for each round. Numbers in brackets denote player seedings; players in bold denote match winners. The draw for the first round took place at Hallamshire Golf Club on 16 April 2015, one day after the end of the last qualifying round.\nQualifying.\nThe three qualifying rounds took place between 8 and 15 April 2015 at the Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield, England. All matches were played as the best-of-19 frames.\nCentury breaks.\nTelevised stage centuries.\nThere were 86 century breaks in the televised stage of the World Championship. For every century break made during the 17-day championship in Sheffield, the title sponsor, Betfred, pledged to donate £200 to World Snooker's official charity, the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice; in line with the sponsor's declaration, the donation was rounded up to £25,000 as at least 70 centuries were achieved. Neil Robertson and Bingham each compiled a break of 145, the highest breaks achieved in the tournament.\nQualifying stage centuries.\nThere were 83 century breaks in the qualifying stage of the World Championship: Three players, Tom Ford, Craig Steadman and David Morris each made the highest break of qualifying, 140."

        "text": "The 2015 Masters (officially the 2015 Dafabet Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place between 11 and 18 January 2015 at the Alexandra Palace in London, England. It was the 41st staging of the Masters tournament, which was first held in 1975, and the second of three Triple Crown events in the 2014–15 snooker season, following the 2014 UK Championship and preceding the 2015 World Snooker Championship. It was sponsored by online bettig site Dafabet.\nThe participants were invited to the tournament based on the world rankings as they stood after the UK Championship. However, Ali Carter, who had been unable to take part in several events due to lung cancer, had his position amongst the top 16 frozen and was allowed to play, while Graeme Dott, who was 16th in the standing, had to sit out the event. Carter thus played his first match since being given all-clear from his illness. He received a standing ovation from the crowd before his first-round encounter with Barry Hawkins, which he won 6–1.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having defeated Mark Selby 10–4 in the previous year's final. He equalled Stephen Hendry's career record of 775 competitive century breaks in his first-round match against Ricky Walden, on the exact date of Hendry's 46th birthday. Two days later, in the first frame of his quarter-final match against Marco Fu, O'Sullivan set a new record when he compiled the 776th century of his career. In defeating Fu 6–1, O'Sullivan also broke Hendry's record for the most wins in the Masters, setting a new record of 43. However, he lost 1–6 to Neil Robertson in the semi-finals. Shaun Murphy won his first Masters title, beating Robertson 10–2 in the final, the biggest winning margin in a Masters final since Steve Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0 in 1988. In winning the title, Murphy became the tenth player to win all Triple Crown events at least once. This year's final line up was a repeat of the 2012 tournament, albeit with a different result.\nA total of 28 century breaks were compiled throughout the tournament. Marco Fu made the 112th official maximum break during his first-round match against Stuart Bingham. This was Fu's third official 147 and the seventh maximum break in the 2014–15 season. It was the third maximum break in Masters history, after Kirk Stevens's maximum in 1984 and Ding Junhui's in 2007.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is an invitational snooker tournament first held in 1975. Organised by World Snooker, the 2015 Masters was the 41st staging of the tournament. It was the second Triple Crown event of the 2014–15 snooker season, following the 2014 UK Championship and preceding the 2015 World Snooker Championship. Held between 11 and 18 January 2015, the event was played at the Alexandra Palace in London. Matches were played as the best-of-11 until the final, which was the best-of-19 frames played over two . The event was sponsored for the second time by online betting site Dafabet.\nParticipants.\nThe event usually features the 16 players who are placed highest in the rankings after the UK Championship, which took place in December 2014. Ronnie O'Sullivan, the defending champion, was the number one seed, with Mark Selby, the rigning world champion, seeded second. The remaining places were allocated to players based on the latest world rankings (revision 5 of the season), except that Ali Carter was seeded 13th, despite being ranked 18th, because of lung cancer, which had stopped him from playing for an extended period of time. World Snooker and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association decided to freeze his position amongst the top 16 for the remainder of the season \"to make up lost ground\" for the events he missed due to illness. Players ranked 13th to 15th were seeded 14th to 16th, while Graeme Dott, ranked 16th, was not invited. The field was the same as in 2014 except that Carter returned for his 9th appearance in place of Mark Davis.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money of the event was unchanged at £600,000. The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 11 and 14 January 2015 as the best-of-11 frames. In the opening match, a repeat of the previous year semi-final, three-time champion and latest runner-up Mark Selby faced Shaun Murphy. Although Selby opened up with a of 100, Murphy put himself 5–1 ahead with five consecutive frames. Selby replied with four frames on the trot, including of 120, 54 and 92, and forced a . Murphy clinched the match in the eleventh and final frame. In the evening, Marco Fu was already 2–1 ahead of Stuart Bingham when he made the 112th official maximum break. This was Fu's third official 147 and the seventh maximum break in the 2014–15 season. It was also the third maximum break in Masters history, after Kirk Stevens's in 1984 and Ding Junhui's in 2007. Fu went on to win the match with another century of 103 and a result of 6–3.\nThe following afternoon, 2012 semi-finalist Judd Trump was up against Stephen Maguire, who had reached the semi-finals of the event in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2014. Although Trump took the first frame, in which both players managed to make a , and followed it with the second, Maguire then won four on the spin, including breaks of 96 and 82. Trump replied with breaks of 109 and 71, but Maguire won the last two to seal victory. In the evening, Robert Milkins, competing in his second Masters, faced Neil Robertson, the 2012 champion. The first eight frames were shared, with breaks of 94 and 69 for Milkins and 60, 77, 51 and 95 for Roberston. The Australian claimed victory thanks to a 117 century and a further half-century of 76, for a result of 6–4.\nThe next day, Ronnie O'Sullivan, the defending champion, played Ricky Walden. A 100-point century in the sixth frame gave O'Sullivan a 5–1 lead, but Walden replied with a century of 100 as well and managed to pull back to 4–5. In what would turn out to be the last frame of the match, O'Sullivan ran out of position when he was on 89, but managed to the and went on to the rest of the to compile a 121 century. In doing so, he equalled Stephen Hendry's career record of 775 competitive century breaks. \"I am not bothered, it was a matter of time\", said Hendry, who turned 46 that very same day and was commentating for the BBC. In the evening, Ali Carter played his first match since being given all-clear from lung cancer. He received a standing ovation from the crowd before his encounter with Barry Hawkins, which he won 6–1, featuring breaks of 95, 50 and 130.\nMark Allen, 2011 semi-finalist, met John Higgins, 1999 and 2006 winner. Higgins won the first two frames with century breaks of 104 and 132, and Allen took the third with a further century of 121. Higgins was 3–1 in front at one point and also made a 120 in the penultimate frame, but would end up losing the match 4–6 to Allen, who edged him out with a 65 break. In the last match of the quarter-finals, Ding Junhui, the 2011 champion, was paired with Joe Perry, who had never got past the first round. Perry took the first frame with a break of 79, and Ding responded with an 80. Perry then opened a two-frame gap, including a century of 104, and ended up winning 6–3, closing out the match with a 104.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place on 15 and 16 January as the best-of-11 frames. In the first frame of his encounter with Fu, O'Sullivan made a 101 century and thus set a new record for most career centuries, surpassing by one the 775 made by Hendry. \"I was a bit nervous because I knew everyone was thinking about it. It was nice to get it out of the way early\", said O'Sullivan afterwards. Further breaks of 67, 85 and 66 secured him a 6–1 win, which meant that he also broke Hendry's record for the most wins in the Masters, setting a new tally of 43. Robertson took a 2–0 advantage with breaks of 128 and 57 against Carter, who responded with a 63 break in the third frame to halve the deficit. However, Roberston won the rest of the frames to seal a 6–1 victory, making breaks of 98, 127 and 84 in the process.\nAllen raced into a 3–1 advantage, but Perry drew level with back-to-back frames, including breaks of 50 and 68. Allen took the ninth frame and, although Perry compiled a 67 break, Allen followed in with a 55 and won the match 6–4 in the following frame. In the last game of the quarter-finals, played that evening, scores were level between Maguire and Murphy after four frames, with a century of 137 for the former and another one of 103 for the latter. Murphy did not take the lead till the ninth frame, which he won with a century of 103, and then closed the match in the tenth.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 17 January as the best-of-11 frames. In his match against O'Sullivan, Robertson took the opening frame with a century break and then the second one, in which a break of 66 was enough to neutralize the 63 made by O'Sullivan. He enlarged his lead to 3–0, although O'Sullivan, who had won fifteen consecutive matches up to that point, hit back with a century of his own in the fourth frame to go 1–3. Robertson advanced into the final winning another three frames on the trot, including breaks of 58 and 60. \"[Neil] took me apart like someone of his ability and calibre would when they are comfortable with their game\", said O'Sullivan afterwards.\nIn the other semi-final, Allen raced into a 2–0 lead against Murphy. Murphy, however, would concede no more frames in the match, winning six on the trot thanks to breaks of 80, 83, 72, 102 and 60.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as the best-of-19 frames, held over two sessions on 18 January, between Robertson and Murphy. The match was officiated by Brendan Moore. The two players had previously faced each other in the 2012 final, when Robertson had lifted the trophy with a 10–6 result. In the first session, played in the afternoon, Murphy won the first five frames of the match, with a 127 century in the third one. Robertson responded with a half-century of 80 in the sixth and both players shared the last two frames of the session to end it with a 6–2 score favourable to Murphy.\nEven though Robertson compiled a break of 51 in the first frame of the evening session, Murphy took it by two points. He then followed it with a century of 127, which was described as \"superb\" by Shamoon Hafez writing for the BBC. Murphy also won the following frame and put himself only one away from victory. He closed the match with a 60 break and a 10–2 result. It was Murphy's first Masters title, and he collected £200,000 in prize money. It was the biggest winning margin in a Masters final since Steve Davis whitewashed Mike Hallett 9–0 in 1988. In winning the title, Murphy became the tenth player to win all Triple Crown events at least once, having previously been champion of the 2005 World Snooker Championship and the 2008 UK Championship. Robertson congratulated Murphy: \"I just could not produce the sort of snooker that got me to the final. I'd just like to say welcome to the Triple Crown club. He is a worthy champion\".\nCentury breaks.\nTotal: 28"

        "title": "Jackie Walker (American football, born 1950)",
        "text": "Jackie Eugene Walker (April 14, 1950 – December 5, 2002) was an American football linebacker who played for the University of Tennessee from 1969 to 1971. A two-time All-American, he was the first black captain of a Southeastern Conference squad. Walker shares the NCAA record for most interceptions returned for a touchdown, with five. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 1972 NFL Draft, but was cut before the season.\nIn the years following his death, Walker's supporters campaigned to have him inducted into local and national halls of fame, arguing he has been denied such recognition because he was gay.\nEarly life.\nWalker was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, one of five children of Norman and Violet (Wilson) Walker. He grew up in what is now the Parkridge neighborhood of East Knoxville. His older brother, Marshall, was among the first African-American students to attend a desegregated Fulton High School, where he was a standout in football, and was awarded a scholarship to Florida A&amp;M.\nJackie followed in his brother's footsteps, joining the Fulton squad in 1965. His head coach, Lon Herzbrun, had played for Tennessee in the mid-1950s, and had built Fulton into a regional powerhouse. During his senior year in 1967, Walker averaged over 20 tackles per game, and was named All-State, helping lead Fulton to an undefeated season. In a game against Oak Ridge, he delivered a legendary tackle, known simply as \"The Hit,\" that knocked an opposing player unconscious.\nTennessee.\nWalker had planned to follow his brother to Florida A&amp;M, but was offered a scholarship to Tennessee. He and Andy Bennett became only the school's second and third black football players (the first, Lester McClain, had joined the team in 1967). Walker played briefly for the freshman team in 1968 (freshmen were ineligible to play for the varsity squad prior to the 1970s) before suffering an injury.\nPrior to his sophomore season in 1969, Tennessee head coach Doug Dickey hired Walker's high school coach, Lon Herzbrun, to coach linebackers. After naming Walker a starter, Herzbrun, realizing the gamble he was taking, told skeptics that if the move failed, \"you can have my job.\" Starting alongside hard-hitting seniors Steve Kiner and Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds, Walker made an immediate impact. In Tennessee's 41–14 rout of rival Alabama later that year, Walker intercepted a pitch-out and returned it 27 yards for a touchdown. In Tennessee's 31–26 win over Kentucky, Walker intercepted a pass from Kentucky quarterback Steven Tingle and returned it 54 yards for a touchdown. He was named a Sophomore All-American by \"The Football News\" at the end of the season.\nDuring the 1970 season, Tennessee head coach Bill Battle (who had taken over after Dickey resigned to coach at Florida) entrusted Walker with signal-calling duties, which required reading the opposing offensive formation, and calling the play for the defense. In Tennessee's 24–0 win over Alabama, Walker intercepted two passes, returning one for a touchdown, and registered two tackles-for-loss in helping his team inflict a rare shutout on a Bear Bryant-coached team. A week later, Walker returned another interception for a touchdown in Tennessee's 38–7 win over Florida. In Tennessee's narrow 20–18 win over South Carolina in November, Walker registered 10 tackles, including one in which he stopped a Gamecock running back short of the goal line, intercepted two passes, and recovered a fumble. He finished the season with a team-leading 132 tackles (84 solo), including nine tackles-for-loss and two sacks, to go along with five interceptions. Walker was named an All-American by \"The Football News\" and the National Editorial Association.\nPrior to his senior year in 1971, Walker's teammates elected him team captain, making him the first black player to achieve this distinction in the Southeastern Conference (one of the players he outpolled was future head coach Phillip Fulmer, who was at the time a senior offensive lineman). In Tennessee's 10–9 loss to Auburn in the second game of the season, Walker blocked a field goal attempt, blocked it again after Tennessee was called offside, and nearly blocked the go-ahead PAT in the fourth quarter. He was named \"Southeast Defensive Player of the Week\" by UPI. In Tennessee's 20–13 win over Florida the following week, Walker intercepted a pass, and forced a missed field goal and a missed extra point.\nIn Tennessee's game against Alabama in October 1971, Coach Bear Bryant was so concerned with Walker that he tasked three offensive linemen, among them John Hannah, one of the best linemen to ever play the game, with neutralizing the Tennessee linebacker. Walker's teammate Jamie Rotella later recalled that the scheme was effective, though Walker fought vehemently through every block. \"We didn't really care about concussions then,\" Rotella said, \"but he probably had one and continued playing.\" Walker finished the game with 17 tackles, but Tennessee was unable to overcome eight turnovers by its own offense, and fell 32–15. Alabama continued using the blocking scheme, which became known as \"The Jackie Walker Play,\" against subsequent opponents.\nIn Tennessee's 10–7 win over Mississippi State the following week, Walker intercepted a pass from Bulldog quarterback Hal Chealander and returned it 43 yards for what would prove the game-winning touchdown. He returned his NCAA-record fifth career interception for a touchdown in Tennessee's regular season finale against Penn State, helping the Vols upset the previously unbeaten and heavily favored Nittany Lions, 31–11. He finished the season with 126 tackles (74 solo), including three tackles-for-loss, to go along with four interceptions, and was again named an All-American at the end of the season.\nDuring his career, Walker intercepted 11 passes, five of which he returned for touchdowns. He had 281 total return yards (over 25 yards per interception). He registered 258 total tackles in 1970 and 1971 (tackles were not recorded in 1969), including twelve tackles-for-loss, forced six fumbles, and recovered four. Walker's five interceptions returned for touchdowns remains an NCAA record, though he now shares it with three other players, most recently Darrent Williams of Oklahoma State (2001–2004). Tennessee posted a record of 30–5 during Walker's three-year stint as a starting linebacker.\nNFL and later life.\nWalker was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the sixth round of the 1972 NFL Draft. At just 6'0\", 200 pounds, he was considered too small to play linebacker in the NFL, and the 49ers had hoped to convert him to a strong safety. After struggling with the position change, he was cut just prior to the start of the season. Herzbrun, his former coach, suggested the 49ers weren't patient enough in waiting for Walker to transition to the new position. However, Walker later confided to his friend, artist Daw'U Smith, that he was cut because the 49ers organization found out he was gay. He afterward tried out for the Washington Redskins, but was unable to make the team.\nWhile Walker never publicly \"came out\" as gay, he made little attempt to hide the fact after his senior season at Tennessee. By the end of the year, his family, teammates and coaches were aware of his sexual orientation. Herzbrun remembered that while driving to Walker's draft party in East Knoxville, a nervous Coach Battle stated he was going leave if Walker showed up in a dress.\nAbandoning his attempts at an NFL career in 1974, Walker moved to Atlanta, where he worked for the city's parks and recreation department. After contracting HIV in 1998, he spent his final years traveling around the world. He died of complications from AIDS on December 5, 2002.\nDuring Walker's final days, his brother Marshall had told him he was going to get him the recognition he deserved. His efforts went largely unnoticed, however, which Marshall suspected was due to Walker's sexual orientation. In 2007, Betty Bean, a reporter for Knoxville's alternative weekly, \"Metro Pulse\", published an article on Walker's life. Walker's former coach Lon Herzbrun and several former teammates, among them Vol Network color analyst Tim Priest and Tennessee head coach Phillip Fulmer, were astonished to learn that Walker's career had mostly gone unnoticed, and began campaigning on his behalf. Walker was inducted into the Greater Knoxville Sports Hall of Fame in 2008, and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2014, Walker was one of 75 players on the ballot for induction into the College Football Hall of Fame, but was not among the 14 players selected."

        "title": "Rugby Europe",
        "text": "Rugby Europe is the administrative body for rugby union in Europe. It was formed in 1999 to promote, develop, organise, and administer the game of rugby in Europe under the authority of World Rugby (the sport's global governing body). However, it is not responsible for the organisation of the Six Nations Championship or the competitions run by European Professional Club Rugby (the European Rugby Champions Cup and Challenge Cup).\nThe predecessor to Rugby Europe was the Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA), which was established in 1934 to administer rugby union in Europe outside the authority of the International Rugby Football Board (as World Rugby was then called), and came to spread outside the continent. FIRA agreed to come under the auspices of World Rugby in the 1990s, and appended 'Association Européenne de Rugby' to its name in a return to being a European body. In 2014 the organisation was renamed Rugby Europe as part of a re-branding.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Rugby Europe suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from Rugby Europe.\nMember unions.\nRugby Europe has 47 member unions as of December 2021. Not all European member unions are members of World Rugby. Rugby Europe's members are listed below, with the year each union joined World Rugby shown in brackets.\nThirty-nine World Rugby members are part of Rugby Europe:\nSix members of Rugby Europe are not affiliated with World Rugby:\nNine European nations are not currently affiliated with Rugby Europe or World Rugby:\nNotes:\nHistory.\nFIRA (1934–1999).\nIn 1931, the French Rugby Federation (FFR) was suspended from playing against the other IRFB nations, because the sport's authorities had suspected for many years that the (FFR) was allowing the abuse of the rules on amateurism.\nAs a result, Fédération Internationale de Rugby Amateur (FIRA) was founded in 1934.\nIt was designed to organise rugby union outside the authority of the \"International Rugby Football Board\" (as it was known at the time). The founder members were Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Catalonia, Romania, Holland and Germany. In 1941 the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco forcibly merged Catalonia's team into the Spanish rugby team. Nowadays the Catalan Federation is trying unsuccessfully to reverse this decision, claiming the historical rights as a founder member.\nIn 1965, FIRA inaugurated the FIRA Nation's Cup, and in 1974 the FIRA Championship, later renamed the European Nations Cup (ENC). The ENC provided international competition for European countries outside the Five Nations. The ENC was played in three divisions, comprising most countries in Continental Europe. The ENC later expanded its horizons, taking in Morocco and Tunisia.\nThe ENC first division competition was won most often by France, but Romania won it five times, and Italy once, in its last edition, in 1995–1997. France and Italy no longer play in the ENC, as both countries now play in the Six Nations Championship.\nFIRA–AER (1999–2014).\nIn the 1990s, FIRA recognised the IRB as the governing body of rugby union worldwide and after negotiations with the IRB, it agreed to integrate itself within the organisation. In 1999, it changed its name to \"FIRA – Association of European Rugby\" (FIRA–AER), to promote and rule over rugby union in the European area and to run the junior world championship. FIRA-AER organised both the under-19 and under-21 world championships until IRB folded them into the competitions now known as the World Rugby Under 20 Championship and World Rugby Under 20 Trophy in 2008.\nRugby Europe (2014–present).\nIn June 2014, during the annual convention of FIRA-AER in Split, it was decided to rename the organisation to Rugby Europe to provide it with a shorter, more recognisable name.\nRugby Europe international competitions.\nThe highest level of rugby competition played among European countries is the Six Nations Championship, contested every year in February and March by the tier-1 European nations: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The tournament is the oldest international rugby tournament in the world, having begun in 1883, and has been known as the Six Nations Championship since 2000, when Italy joined; it had previously been known as the Home Nations and the Five Nations. There is no promotion or relegation, and since 2000, no country has entered or left the Six Nations. Rugby Europe is not responsible for the organisation of the Six Nations Championship, which is run by the national unions of its participating nations.\nThe next level of international rugby, played by tier-2 and tier-3 European countries, is the Rugby Europe International Championships. It is made up of five levels or divisions: Championship, Trophy, Conference 1, Conference 2 and Development. Each division consists of five, six, or eight teams, and is played on a round robin format for a one-year cycle, with promotion and relegation between levels and the end of the season. As of 2023, the top division Rugby Europe Championship is contested by eight countries – Belgium, Georgia, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain. Of these countries, all but two (Belgium and Poland) have played in a Rugby World Cup and are routinely ranked in the Top 30 in the world. Other countries that have participated in past editions include the Czech Republic and Ukraine. \nOther international competitions.\nSenior Men \nMen XV\nMen Sevens\nSnow rugby\nBeach rugby\nSenior Women \nWomen XV\nWomen Sevens\nSnow rugby\nBeach rugby\nYouth \nMen XV\nMen Sevens\nWomen Sevens\nRugby Europe club competitions.\nThe highest levels of European club competition played in Europe are the European Rugby Champions Cup and Challenge Cup. These tournaments are contested every year by clubs from the tier-1 European nations: England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Rugby Europe is not responsible for the organisation of these competitions, which is run by the European Professional Club Rugby.\nSome European clubs from tier-2 and tier-3 European nations participated in the European Shield, which made up the third-tier club competition below the now defunct Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup. This competition, which was organised solely by European Rugby Cup Ltd, ran from 2002 to 2005 and was primarily made up of tier-1 nations club teams that were knocked out in the first round of the European Challenge Cup, with the addition of one or two teams from tier-2 and tier-3 European nations (Spain, Portugal, and Romania) invited to make up the numbers.\nFrom 2014 to 2019 clubs from tier-2 and tier-3 European countries competed in the European Rugby Continental Shield. This competition was a joint venture between Rugby Europe, European Professional Club Rugby, and the Federazione Italiana Rugby and it provided the winners of this tournament entry into the European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nIn 2021 Rugby Europe set up the Rugby Europe Super Cup which enabled clubs from tier-2 and tier-3 European countries to participate annually. Teams are divided into two conferences: western and eastern. Each team will play every conference rival home and away. The two best teams from each conference will advance to the semi-finals, where they will compete to play in the final. Currently there are eight clubs involved but this is expected to rise to sixteen by 2025.\nProfessional competitions.\nThe following table shows the professional rugby union competitions in various European countries.\nNotes:"

        "text": "An equestrian staircase or riders' staircase is a very gently sloping flight of steps that can be negotiated by horses. Its origins may be seen in the mule staircases in steep terrain in open country.\nUse in interior rooms.\nIts design principles found their way from road construction into building architecture. Here an equestrian staircase was a spiral, curved or repeatedly interrupted ramp within buildings, that had a gently sloped and a non-slip floor, either smooth or frequently divided by transverse ridges. This type of ramp occurs in the towers of churches, castles, fortifications and palaces as well as in the architecture of other buildings within fortifications villas and palaces.\nRepresentation.\nFrom the 15th century, imposing equestrian staircases were built in the stately homes of the nobility. These staircases enabled riders to reach the upper floor on horseback. The equestrian staircase leading to Vladislav Hall in Prague Castle, which was built around 1500, is one of the oldest known examples.\nOther equestrian staircases are found:\nStepless equestrian ramps.\nOccasionally ramps were built without any actual steps, enabling horses to draw a carriage or wagon up the incline. There are examples in Venice (St Mark's Campanile), Geneva (city hall) and Copenhagen (Round Tower)."

        "title": "Mike Johnston (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Mike Johnston (born February 19, 1957) is a Canadian ice hockey coach who currently serves as head coach, vice president and general manager of the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League. Johnston led the Winterhawks to four consecutive WHL Finals appearances, including a championship in 2013.\nAfter six historic seasons in Portland, Johnston was hired as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He spent one plus season as the bench boss of the Penguins before returning to Portland in an elevated role.\nDuring Johnston's nine years in Portland, he helped 28 Winterhawks get drafted into the NHL, including eight players being selected in the first round. Before his tenure with Portland, he worked for Team Canada and spent nearly a decade as an assistant and associate coach with the Vancouver Canucks (1999–2006) and the Los Angeles Kings (2006–2008). [1] Currently he is a \"Hockey Player Development\" instructor for the online sports-career training school Sports Management Worldwide, founded and run by Dr. Lynn Lashbrook.\nCoaching career.\nJohnston initially started coaching at the College and University level in Canada. He coached college hockey in Alberta for five seasons before becoming the head coach of the University of New Brunswick from 1989 – 1994, winning two McAdam Division titles, and finishing with three first-place finishes and an overall record of 77–44–6. He was named the 3M Coach of the Year in 1994 and won the Telegraph Journal Coach of the Year Award in 1993.\nInternationally, Johnston worked for Team Canada for five seasons from 1994 to 1999 serving in the capacity of general manager and associate coach and finally head coach for the 1998–1999 season, and was an assistant coach at the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. In addition to the championships at the senior level, Johnston won three gold medals as head coach for Canada at the Spengler Cup Tournament and two World Junior Championships as an assistant coach in 1994 and 1995.\nIn 1994 he became general manager and associate coach of the Canadian national men's hockey team. In 1998 he became the head coach for one season. He then spent six seasons as, at first, an assistant coach and then as an associate coach with the Vancouver Canucks. During Johnston's time in Vancouver, the Canucks made four straight trips to the postseason and won the Northwest Division in 2003–2004. After that, he was an associate coach of the Los Angeles Kings.\nWestern Hockey League.\nJohnston was the coach and general manager of the Portland Winterhawks of the WHL from 2008 to 2014, where he amassed a record of 231–114–10–10, landing him second on the Winterhawks' all-time wins list.\nIn his second season with the Hawks in 2009–10, Johnston guided the team to a 48-point improvement from the prior season, a franchise record, and an appearance in the second round of the playoffs. The Winterhawks topped the 100-point barrier in 2010–11 with 103 points, a U.S. Division title and then their first of four straight trips to the WHL championship series.\nAfter 102 points in 2011–12, they advanced to the WHL championship and the first of their three straight WHL Finals series against the Edmonton Oil Kings. In 2012–13 the Winterhawks had their greatest season in team history, with franchise records of 57 wins and 117 points, and a league record 29 road wins, as they won the third WHL championship in franchise history and advanced to the final of the 2013 Memorial Cup. In 2013–14 the Winterhawks set another franchise record under Johnston, with a 21-game winning streak as they amassed 113 points and their fourth consecutive trip to the championship series. Johnston returned to the Winterhawks for the 2016–17 season as head coach, general manager and vice president of the team. In his first year back with the Winterhawks, Portland amassed 40 wins for the sixth straight season under Johnston.\nSuspension.\nAfter an investigation by the Canadian Hockey League, Johnston was suspended by the Western Hockey League for the duration of the 2012–13 WHL season, after it was revealed he offered improper player benefits and committed various recruitment violations over a four-year period. Some of the noted improper benefits Johnston offered to Winterhawk players included paying for their families to come to Portland multiple times during the season by subsidizing travel costs to the city, financing private summer training programs and providing cellular telephones to the team captains. As a result of the violations, Johnston was forced to hand over his general manager and head coaching positions to assistant coach Travis Green, who would guide the club to the Ed Chynoweth Cup. As a punishment for violating league rules, the team was forced to forfeit the first five rounds of the 2013 WHL Bantam Draft, along with their first round draft picks until 2017. The investigation into Johnston's conduct came months after the Ontario Hockey League's Windsor Spitfires were fined for improper player benefits and recruitment violations. Johnston's suspension was lifted at the end of the season.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nJohnston was hired as the head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins on June 25, 2014. During the 2014–15 season, the Penguins stormed out of the gate to a 22–6–4 record, but as injuries started to mount, Pittsburgh began to struggle and finished the season eighth in the Eastern Conference, nearly breaking their postseason appearance streak at 8 consecutive playoff qualifications. The Penguins would be eliminated in the first-round of the playoffs by the New York Rangers.\nIn his second season with Pittsburgh, the Penguins started the 2015–16 season 15–10–3, and Johnston was fired on December 12, 2015. In a team statement announcing the firing, general manager Jim Rutherford stated that he felt the team was \"underachieving\".\nJohnston's combined record with the Penguins was 58–37–15.\nPersonal life.\nJohnston played hockey for Brandon University in Manitoba and Acadia University in Nova Scotia, and holds a master's degree in Coaching Science from Acadia University.\nJohnston and his wife Myrna have two children, Gabby and Adam, who serves as a scout for the Portland Winterhawks.\nJohnston is the uncle of professional hockey players, Ryan Johnston and Rebecca Johnston.\nBooks.\nJohnston has authored three books with former NHL player Ryan Walter: \"Simply the Best: Insights and Strategies from the Great Hockey Coaches\", \"Simply the Best: Players on Performance\", and \"Hockey Plays and Strategies\"."

        "title": "Golf on Fox",
        "text": "Golf coverage on Fox Sports properties have occurred occasionally since 1999. From 1999 through 2002, its regional sports network group Fox Sports Networks (FSN) sub-licensed early-round coverage of PGA Tour events from Golf Channel (a network in which Fox was an early investor).\nFrom 2015 to June 2020, Fox served as the broadcaster of the national open tournaments and amateur championships of the United States Golf Association (USGA), including the U.S. Open — one of the four Men's major golf championships, under a 12-year deal. Coverage aired on the Fox broadcast network, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, and Fox Deportes. In late-June 2020, however, Fox announced that it would opt out of the contract, and sell the remainder to former USGA broadcast television rightsholder NBC Sports.\nBackground.\nEarly Fox Sports golf involvement.\nFox Sports partnered with Greg Norman in the early 1990s to create the World Golf Tour, which would have consisted of six events televised on Fox. However, the proposed events were met with legal issues (including a threat by PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem to suspend any golfer who participates). In 1996, Fox acquired a minority stake in Golf Channel.\nFox Sports bid for a portion of the PGA Tour's television rights starting in 1999. Although it did not gain the broadcast package (which was divided among the Big Three networks), Golf Channel would simulcast its early-round coverage on Fox's regional sports networks group Fox Sports Networks, as they had wider carriage. These simulcasts ended after 2002, when the PGA Tour's cable rights were acquired by ESPN and USA Network. Fox had also sold its minority stakes in Golf Channel and Outdoor Life Network to Comcast, as part of a transaction that saw Fox acquire Comcast's stakes in Speedvision.\nIn 2011, Fox Sports gained the rights to the CVS Caremark Charity Classic, which is an unofficial money event on the PGA Tour, and had been previously televised by Golf Channel. The coverage aired on Fox Sports Net, with Kraig Kann hosting. Fox did not renew its rights for 2012.\nUSGA coverage.\nOn August 6, 2013, Fox Sports announced a 12-year, $1.1 billion deal to broadcast the open tournaments and amateur championships of the USGA, including the U.S. Open, U.S. Senior Open, and U.S. Women's Open, beginning in 2015. Fox would replace NBC and ESPN as the rightsholders of the events. NBC's lead analyst Johnny Miller expressed disappointment at the loss, saying that he \"had a feeling\" NBC would not retain rights, and that Fox would not be able to \"fall out of a tree and do the U.S. Open.\"\nAs a prelude to the new package, Fox televised the 2014 Franklin Templeton Shootout, debuting its lead commentary team of Joe Buck and Greg Norman. Fox's first U.S. Open had a total of 38.5 hours of coverage, with 22 on Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours on Saturday and Sunday; the Fox Sports 1 cable network had a total of 16 hours of coverage on Thursday and Friday. The Fox broadcast network had a total of 22.5 hours of coverage Thursday through Sunday, with six hours Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours Saturday and Sunday. Fox utilized a number of new technologies during its production, including drone flyovers, a camera-equipped RC car for ground perspectives, and new graphics—including a live shot tracer, an augmented reality display of green contours, and a persistent top-5 leaderboard displayed in the bottom-right of the screen.\nFox's coverage received mixed reviews by critics and viewers, noting technical issues with on-air graphics during early coverage of the first round, on-air personnel (including the chemistry between Buck and Norman, and use of NFL reporters such as Curt Menefee), and missed shots due to poor camera angles or other on-air segments, although Buck did receive positive reviews by some, as well as Fox's technical innovations.\nIn the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. Open, Norman was dismissed by Fox, and replaced by Paul Azinger.\nEnd of coverage.\nOn June 29, 2020, it was announced that Fox Sports had opted out of the remaining seven years of its contract to cover USGA events, and had sold the remainder of the contract to NBC Sports. The re-scheduling of the 2020 U.S. Open to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic had caused conflicts with Fox's football coverage, and the USGA forbade Fox from carrying the event exclusively on cable. While the network discussed the possibility of partnering with NBC on the 2020 tournament, this eventually \"led to a broader conversation and eventual agreement for NBCUniversal to take over the USGA media rights\".\nDue to being the only one of the four major networks that does not have any ties to the PGA Tour's media rights, Fox was anticipated as a potential US broadcaster for LIV Golf—a Saudi-backed golf competition also led by Norman; in September 2022, \"Golfweek\" reported that LIV was reaching a time-buy agreement to carry its events on Fox Sports 1. However, LIV denied the reports, and ultimately signed with Nexstar Media Group and The CW in 2023.\nTheme music.\nFox did not carry over \"In Celebration of Man\", the Yanni-composed music that had been used by NBC for its U.S. Open coverage, choosing to commission film composer Brian Tyler to compose new music (after acquiring rights to The Open Championship beginning in 2016, NBC instated an updated version of \"In Celebration of Man\" as its theme music for the tournament). Tyler explained that his composition was intended to \"capture the epic struggle, the challenge, the history, the heartbreak, and the elation of competitive golf,\" and acknowledged that \"Sports and music have always had an important connection for me. I love the way iconic sports themes evoke the spirit of sporting events and can provide dramatic impact and nostalgic memory.\"\nCommentators.\nOn April 23, 2014, Fox Sports announced that Greg Norman would join Joe Buck as its lead golf commentary team. Buck and Norman worked together for the first time at the 2014 U.S. Open, where Fox produced studio programming that aired against ESPN and NBC's studio shows.\n2015 U.S. Open.\nOn November 18, 2014, in advance of its coverage of the Franklin Templeton Shootout, Fox announced the full layout of its golf team.\n2016 U.S. Open.\nIn January 2016, Greg Norman was let go by Fox in response to poor reception towards his performance during the U.S. Open, and was replaced by former ESPN analyst Paul Azinger. The network's 2016 U.S. Open team:\n2017 U.S. Open.\nIn 2017, Fox made several changes to the commentator team:\n2018 U.S. Open.\nFor the 2018 U.S. Open, Fox announced that they would be splitting their lead commentary booths into two teams. This was done in an effort to avoid the occasional logjam caused by a three-man booth, which had been Joe Buck with analysts Paul Azinger and Brad Faxon. Therefore, Azinger would now be paired with Buck, and Faxon would be paired alongside Shane Bacon."

The champion was exempt but otherwise the field was determined during a one-round qualifier. In 1978, the local supermarket King Kullen began sponsoring the tournament. They helped provide a record $10,000 purse. King Kullen became the title sponsor in 1980.

Following the departure of Eric Elwood, the 2013–14 season saw Pat Lam take charge of the team as head coach.\nReview.\nBackground.\nThe previous season's head coach Eric Elwood departed Connacht at the end of his third year in charge, having announced his intention to leave his post in October 2012. His replacement was announced in January 2013, with the New Zealand born former Samoa international Pat Lam appointed to coach the team. Lam had previously served as head coach to Super Rugby side the Auckland Blues, coaching them in the 2009 and 2010 seasons.\nIt was announced in August 2013 that the captaincy for the 2013–14 season would be split between Gavin Duffy, John Muldoon (rugby union, born 1982) and the team's most capped player, Michael Swift. This followed changes between Duffy and Muldoon as captain in previous seasons.\nThe team qualified for their third Heineken Cup in a row in 2013–14, again thanks to Leinster, who had also been the reason for Connacht's entry into the previous two tournaments. The eastern province's victory in the 2012–13 European Challenge Cup granted Connacht a berth, and they were drawn into pool 3 with Saracens, Toulouse, and Zebre.\nPlaying season.\nLam's first competitive game in charge was in the 2013–14 Pro12, a 25–16 home win over Zebre. After this game Connacht failed to win their next five games, though they ran Saracens close in Galway, in the first Heineken Cup game of the season. Connacht eventually broke their losing streak with a win in the Heineken Cup, again coming against Zebre, this time in the Stadio XXV Aprile. In their next match, Connacht came close to beating Leinster in Dublin for the first time since 2002, but conceded a late penalty try to lose 16–13.\nThe team's patchy form continued after the derby with Leinster, and Connacht lost three more games in the Pro12. After a 43–10 defeat to Edinburgh in Murrayfield, former captain of the Super Rugby side the Chiefs, Craig Clarke, was made Connacht's team captain. On 8 December 2013, however, Connacht defied their form and produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Heineken Cup, when they defeated Toulouse in the pool stages in the Stade Ernest-Wallon.\nConnacht were beaten by Toulouse in the return game at the Sportsground, but beat Zebre in the following game to go into the final round of matches with a slim chance of progressing to the quarter-finals. That game however, saw them beaten comfortably by Saracens on a final score of 64–6, with English side running in a record 11 tries. In the league Connacht continued to tussle with Zebre at the foot of the table, before going on a four match winning streak from 15 February to 23 March, earning three try bonus points. This was the team's longest run of wins in 11 years. Following this run of form though, Connacht failed to win another match in the league, finishing in tenth place and level on points with Newport Gwent Dragons in ninth.\nSenior Playing Squad.\nAcademy squad.\n year 2\n year 2\n year 2\n year 1\n year 1\n year 2\n year 1\n year 1\n year 1\n year 1\n year 1\n year 2\n year 1\n year 3\n year 3\n year 3\n year 1\n year 3\n year 2\n year 2\n year 1\nPlaying kit.\nThe Connacht team and support staff kit supplier for the season was Australian manufacturer BLK sport, who announced a comprehensive four-year agreement to supply the full range of apparel for all of Connacht Rugby's representative teams and support staff in 2013.

        "text": "Luis Giraldo Casanova Castillo (born December 5, 1956) is a former baseball player in the Cuban National Series who had a successful career in international tournaments. Casanova's teams won many titles in Cuban league play, and he led the league in all three Triple Crown statistics (batting average, home runs, and runs batted in) at least once. He led major international tournaments in home runs seven times.\nPersonal life.\nCasanova was born in Bahía Honda, Cuba. He was nicknamed \"El Señor Pelotero\". He is the brother of Leovigildo Casanova and uncle of Reinier Casanova.\n1970s.\nCasanova made his debut on the international stage in the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games. The 21-year-old outfielder helped the Cuban national team win a Gold Medal, going 20 for 33 and tying for the most doubles (5).\nIn the 1978 Amateur World Series, Casanova hit .444 with 12 runs and eight RBI in ten games.

He tied Terry Francona for the most triples (3) and tied Francona and Agustin Marquetti for the most hits. In the 1979 Intercontinental Cup, Casanova hit .375 as Cuba cruised to victory.\nCasanova had his first great season in domestic play in Cuba in the 1979-1980 Serie Nacional, leading in runs (64) and walks (57). He tied for the most sacrifice flies (5) and his 18 home runs tied Pedro José Rodríguez, Sr. for the most.\n1980s.\nCasanova tied Antonio Muñoz for the 1980 Amateur World Series lead in home runs with seven as Cuba won Gold. In the 1981 Serie Nacional season, Casanova led the league with 9 times hit by pitch. In the Selective Series of 1981, he hit .363, leading the league in batting average. He also tied for the league lead in triples, with four. During the 1981 Intercontinental Cup, Casanova's Cuban team failed to win Gold for the first and only time of his career. He was 19 for 37 at the plate and led in average (.514), home runs (6), runs (12), hits (15) and RBI (19). Casanova won MVP honors though the USA took home the Gold Medal.\nIn the 1982 Selective Series, he led the league in runs scored with 49. He also tied for the league lead in triples, with four. It was the only year from 1978-1986 that Casanova did not play on the international stage, as Cuba sat out the 1982 Amateur World Series. During the 1982-1983 Serie Nacional, Casanova tied Alejo O'Reilly for the most walks, with 34.\nCasanova batted .389 in a backup role in the 1983 Intercontinental Cup, as Cuba won Gold. In the 1983-1984 Serie Nacional, the 27-year-old veteran tied Lázaro Junco for the league lead in home runs, with 20. He tied for the most doubles (19) and led with 67 RBI.

Casanova helped Cuba to Gold; among those he outslugged was American Barry Bonds. He was to appear in the 1984 Olympics, but did not because Cuba boycotted them. Casanova batted .429 in the 1985 Intercontinental Cup, which he led in home runs (6) and RBI (19).\nDuring the 1986 Amateur World Series, Casanova hit .409 with a tournament-leading 19 RBI and six home runs to help Cuba win Gold. He tied Italy's Giuseppe Carelli for most RBI. In the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games, the outfield superstar hit .500 and led the tournament with 16 runs scored.

He hit all of his home runs in a single game, becoming only the second person to hit three home runs in a Baseball World Cup game (the other was Antonio Muñoz, who did it in 1980).\nIn the 1991 Intercontinental Cup, Casanova tied Prospero Baca and Wei-Cheng Chen for second in the tournament in RBI, with 12, as Cuba won yet another Gold. Furthermore, he hit .364 with nine walks, ten runs and four home runs in 11 games. He was second in home runs, one behind Jose Ramon Padilla.\nCasanova was a coach for Nicaragua in the 1998 Baseball World Cup.\nCuban Series career statistics.\nOverall, Casanova hit .322 in 17 seasons in Cuba. He belted 312 homers in 5,288 AB, scored 1,144 runs, drove in 1,069 runs and drew 1,049 walks.\n21st century.\nIn the 2008-2009 Cuban National League, Casanova managed Pinar del Rio to a second-place finish, three games behind La Habana.

        "title": "2023 Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 2023 Rugby World Cup () was the tenth men's Rugby World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national rugby union teams. It took place in France from 8 September to 28 October 2023 in nine venues across the country. The opening game and final took place at the Stade de France, north of Paris. The tournament was held in the bicentenary year of the purported invention of the sport by William Webb Ellis.\nThe tournament was scheduled to last six weeks, but in February 2021 World Rugby added a week to provide additional rest days for player welfare. This meant that teams had a minimum of five days' rest for all matches. It was the fourth time France has hosted the Rugby World Cup, having previously done so in 2007 and co-hosted the 1991 Rugby World Cup and 1999 Rugby World Cup with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. This was the last tournament to feature 20 teams taking part, as the tournament will be expanded to include 24 teams in 2027.\nThe defending champions were South Africa, who defeated England in the 2019 Rugby World Cup final. South Africa retained their title by defeating New Zealand in the final. In doing so, they became the first team to win the tournament four times and they remain the only team to ever win the World Cup after losing a match in the pool stage, as well as the first team to win successive World Cup titles away from home. The result also marked their second victory over New Zealand in a final (winning 15–12 a.e.t. in 1995), and also their second victory in a final on French soil (defeating England 15–6 in 2007). As well as winning the World Cup after losing a Pool game for the second consecutive time they also noticeably won each of their knockout games against France, England and New Zealand by a margin of only 1 point. \nChile made their first appearance in the tournament. Portugal returned for their second appearance, 16 years after their debut in 2007, also in France.\nHost selection.\nWorld Rugby requested that any members wishing to host the 2023 event were to submit an expression of interest by June 2015. A total of six unions responded. The Italian Rugby Federation were among the members interested, but withdrew from their bid on 28 September 2016. The Argentine Rugby Union and USA Rugby both expressed their interest in hosting the event but ultimately decided against a formal bid. Three bids were officially submitted to World Rugby by the June 2017 deadline.\nOn 15 November 2017, the French Rugby Federation bid was chosen ahead of bids by the South African Rugby Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. France had launched its bid on 9 February 2017.\nVenues.\nStadia.\nOn 17 March 2017, twelve host cities were selected. This list was later reduced to nine cities (excluding Paris, Montpellier, and Lens):\nTeam base camps.\nSource: \nTeams.\nQualification.\nTwenty teams competed. A total of 12 teams gained automatic qualification for the tournament after finishing in the top three of their pool at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which included France already automatically qualified as host. The remaining eight spaces were decided by regional competitions followed by a few cross-regional play-offs.\nTwo berths were reserved to the European region. Spain originally qualified as Europe 2, but Romania lodged an official complaint that Spain had fielded an ineligible player during the qualifying tournament. After a controversial investigation, it was concluded that the player in question had falsified his passport: Spain received a deduction of 10 points, resulting in them being effectively ejected from the competition, with Romania replacing them as Europe 2 behind Georgia, unaffected as Europe 1. Portugal then took Romania's spot in the repechage tournament as Europe 3.\nIn Oceania and Asia, traditional middle powers emerged, with Samoa claiming the region's place at the World Cup (Fiji, New Zealand and Australia having automatically qualified). Tonga, the second Oceanian team, then won a playoff against Hong Kong, the highest ranked Asian representative, to claim their ninth appearance at a Rugby World Cup. Hong Kong proceeded to the final repechage tournament.\nIn Africa, Namibia reached their seventh Rugby World Cup as Africa 1, with Kenya moving forward to the final repechage.\nThe Americas were allocated two qualifying berths through a series of playoff matches spanning both regions. The 2023 Rugby World Cup witnessed historic developments in North and South American rugby. Canada's absence marked the first time in history that the country failed to qualify for the tournament. Similarly, the United States found themselves excluded from the competition for the first time since 1995, representing a notable departure from previous editions. The absence of North American representation significantly shifted the regional dynamic due to unified North and South American qualification matches. \nOn 18 November 2022, Portugal won the repechage tournament, overcoming Kenya, Hong Kong and the United States to be the last country to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n¹as of 4 September 2023 post warm-up matches\nSquads.\nEach team could submit a squad of 33 players for the tournament, an increase from 31 that was allowed in 2019. The squads were to be submitted to World Rugby by 1 September. If a team needed to call-up a new player, a player must first have been withdrawn from the active 33-player squad which is usually as a consequence of a long-term injury.\nOn 1 May, Wales were the first team to name their extended training squad for the tournament.\nDraw.\nThe pool draw took place on 14 December 2020 in Paris. The draw returned to its traditional place of the year following the previous World Cup, after the end-of-year internationals.\nThe seeding system from previous Rugby World Cups was retained with the 12 automatic qualifiers from 2019 being allocated to their respective bands based on their World Rugby Rankings on 1 January 2020:\nThe remaining two bands were made up of the eight qualifying teams, with allocation to each band being based on the previous Rugby World Cup playing strength:\nThis meant the 20 teams, qualified and qualifiers, were seeded thus (world ranking as of 1 January 2020):\nHaving the draw so early (almost three years before the competition) has been criticised. Changes in the World Rugby Rankings have taken place since, meaning that Pool B contained three of the top five teams (Ireland , South Africa and Scotland ), while Pool A contained France and New Zealand . Meanwhile, Pool C's highest-ranked team at the start of the tournament was Fiji . World Rugby CEO Alan Gilpin pledged that draws for future World Cups would be better balanced.\nMatch officials.\nWorld Rugby named the following 12 referees, seven assistant referees and for the first time an expanded television match officials team of seven to handle the 48 matches.\nAmongst the squad, Wayne Barnes officiated at a record fifth Rugby World Cup, while Nika Amashukeli became the first Georgian referee in the World Cup and first Tier 2 representative to referee a game since the game turned professional. Matthew Carley, Karl Dickson and Andrew Brace made their first appearance in a World Cup as a referee and Joy Neville became the first female named on match official panel for a men's Rugby World Cup.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony, directed and written by Jean Dujardin, Olivier Ferracci and Nora Matthey, took place on 8 September 2023 at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, before the opening match between France and New Zealand.\nPool stage.\nCompeting countries were divided into four pools of five teams (pools A to D). Teams in each pool played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\nPoints allocation in pool stage\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage consisted of three single-elimination rounds culminating in a final and a third-place playoff. In the case of a tie in regulation time, two 10-minute periods of extra time would be played to determine a winner. If the scores were tied at the end of extra time, an additional 10-minute \"sudden death\" period would be played, with the first team to score any points being the winner. If the score still remained tied, a kicking competition would ensue."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas, California, United States of America. The event was held from 31 July to 5 August. There were 16 competitors from 16 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Pertti Karppinen of Finland, his third consecutive victory (matching Vyacheslav Ivanov's three golds from 1956 to 1964). Silver went to Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany; Kolbe, who had also taken silver in 1976, was the ninth man to earn multiple medals in the single sculls and the first to do so in non-consecutive Games (having missed the 1980 Olympics due to the American-led boycott). Canada earned its first medal in the event since 1912 with Robert Mills's bronze. East Germany's three-Games podium streak ended with no rowers from that nation present due to the Soviet-led boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo of the 14 single scullers from the 1980 Games returned: two-time gold medalist Pertti Karppinen of Finland and eighth-place finisher Konstatinos Kontomanolis of Greece. The 1976 silver medalist Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany also returned after an absence in 1980 due to the American-led boycott, as did 1976 sixth-place finisher Ricardo Ibarra of Argentina. The Soviet-led boycott in 1984 had little effect on the favourites for the event. Karppinen was favoured to win a third gold, though Kolbe (1975, 1978, 1981, and 1983 World Champion) and Ibarra (1975, 1979, and 1983 Pan American champion and 1980 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner) were expected to challenge him. \nGuatemala and Puerto Rico each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 15th appearance, tying the absent Great Britain for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used since 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining rowers competed in the repechage round for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe three fastest rowers in each repechage heat advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe three fastest rowers in each semifinal advanced to Final A, while the others went to Final B.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nFinal B was used to determine 7th – 12th places."

After retiring from coaching for about six years, Dahl returned to help Chris Schultz at SUNY Geneseo starting in 2011-12.\nCareer.\nAlthough Dahl received a football scholarship from the University of Minnesota, he transferred to and graduated from Pacific Lutheran University in 1976 with a degree in physical education and social sciences. Dahl began his coaching career a few years later when he took over the top job at Bethel College from David Harris. \nOver the course of 5 seasons at the helm Dahl directed the fledgling program on an upwards trajectory, going from 3 wins in his first season to 15 in his last, including being named 1985 MIAC Coach of the Year. Dahl moved east for 1985-86, taking over at Wisconsin–River Falls before receiving the opportunity to serve under storied college coach Herb Brooks as an assistant with St. Cloud State as it was getting ready to move up to Division I.\nDahl remained as an assistant for only one season, however, as Brooks moved back to the NHL to coach the Minnesota North Stars the next year. With the Huskies playing as a D-I independent starting in 1987-88, Dahl was offered the head coaching duties and proceeded to serve in that position for the next 19 years. In only his second year, Dahl led the Huskies to their first tournament berth but lost both games against defending champion Lake Superior State in the first round. In 1991, St. Cloud joined the WCHA, giving it a much better opportunity to receive further invites to the NCAA tournament though it took over a decade for the Huskies t make their return. \nDespite playing against multiple powerhouse teams throughout the 1990s, Dahl was able to keep St. Cloud's record respectable, posting 4 winning seasons and finishing with a sub-.400 mark only once (1995–96) while also making the conference tournament title game in 1994. Dahl closed out the Huskies first decade with the WCHA by leading St. Cloud to their first tournament berth in 2000. The next season Dahl led the Huskies to their first 30-win season and conference tournament championship (the only time in school for either ). From 2000 to 2003 Dahl brought the St. Cloud to four consecutive NCAA tournament berths but failed to win a single game.\nAfter the 2004-05 season Dahl announced his decision to step down as head coach of St. Cloud State to pursue a career in the private sector.\nWhile the move seemed to be an end to Dahl's coaching career he made an unexpected returned behind the bench as a volunteer assistant with SUNY Geneseo in 2011-12, a position he continues to occupy.

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place at Notre Dame Island Olympic Basin, Canada. The event was held from 18 to 25 July. There were 15 competitors from 15 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Pertti Karppinen of Finland, the nation's first medal in the men's single sculls. Karppinen would go on to win three consecutive golds in the event, matching the Soviet Union's Vyacheslav Ivanov who did the same from 1956 to 1964. Silver went to Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany; East Germany took its second consecutive bronze medal in the event, this time with Joachim Dreifke as the rower.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nTwo of the 18 single scullers from the 1972 Games returned: fifth-place finisher Jim Dietz of the United States and seventh-place finisher Seán Drea of Ireland. The two men had each won a silver medal at the World Championships since then (Dietz in 1974 and Drea in 1975), as that event moved from a quadrennial tournament to an annual one; Drea had also won three Diamond Challenge Sculls victories. The reigning World Champion was Peter-Michael Kolbe of West Germany. Kolbe was favored, though Drea was a significant challenger, as was 1975 Pan American champion Ricardo Ibarra of Argentina. \nNo nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 14th appearance, tying the absent Great Britain for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used since 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe three fastest rowers in each heat advanced to the semifinals. The remaining rowers competed in the repechage for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe three fastest rowers in the repechage advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThree fastest rowers in each semi-final advanced to the Final A, while the others to the Final B."

The mascot was chosen in a unanimous vote held before the 2012 European Judo Championships.\nLogo.\nThe logo of the championships was a blue-white rectangle, augmented at the base by a red belt. The colours of the logo repeat the Russian flag. The logo also features a white silhouette of Vladimir Putin taken from a photo on the cover of the book \"Learn Judo with Vladimir Putin\".\nPrize money.\nTotal prize money was $300,000. The winner of the individual competition received $6,000 ($4,800 for the judoka and $1,200 for the coach), the runner-up $4,000 ($3,200 and $800, for the judoka and the coach respectively) and the bronze medalist $2,000 ($1,600 and $400, respectively). The two best judokas (man and woman) were awarded $2,000.\nThe winners of the team competition received a total of $25,000 ($20,000 for judokas and $5,000 for coaches), the runner-up $15,000 ($12,000 and $3,000 respectively) and the bronze medalist $5,000 ($4,000 and $1,000 respectively).\nRules.\nThe rules of competition changed on January 1, 2014.\nThe IJF continued to differentiate judo from other kinds of wrestling, particularly from sambo, and reverted to classical judo traditions. Activity by the hands below the belt in standing position, limited by 2010 rules, is now fully forbidden under penalty of disqualification. In the spirit of saving specific characteristics of judo, possibility of fight for hold is limited: wrong methods of protection from holds is prohibited, and there is a limit to the number of protections from holds. Likewise, other methods of evading fight or blocking of an opponent are forbidden; for example, false attacks or coercion to assume bend position by power. The criteria of victory by fall (ippon) is specified: now a throw must have more power, quickness and amplitude with the fall of the opponent straight to their back. Rituals about combat were also modified: for example, opponents must greet each other only by bows; as handshaking before combat is now forbidden. The Golden score overtime is not limited by time, and winning by judge decision (\"\") is abolished."

Therefore, the first two rounds of the FIFA World Cup qualifiers also acted as qualifiers for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates.\nFormat.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nEntrants.\nThe 46 FIFA-affiliated nations from the AFC entered qualification. In order to determine which nations would compete in the first round and which nations would receive a bye through to the second round, the FIFA World Rankings of January 2015 were used (shown in parentheses), as those were the latest published rankings prior to the first round draw. The FIFA Rankings of January 2015 were also used for seeding of the first round draw; however, for seeding in the second round and third round draws, the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to those draws were used.\nFirst ever participation of Bhutan.

Therefore, the results against the fifth-placed team were not counted when determining the ranking of the runner-up teams.\nThird round.\nThe third round consisted of two groups of six teams. The first two teams in each group qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The two third-placed teams proceeded to the fourth round.\nThe draw for the third round was held on 12 April 2016, at 16:30 MST (), at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nFourth round.\nThe two third-placed teams in each group from the third round played against each other home-and-away over two legs to determine which team advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nThe order of legs was announced during the draw for the third round. Syria played their home match, as with all their home matches in the third round, in Malaysia due to the war time condition in Syria.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe draw for the inter-confederation play-offs was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg.

It was then acquired by Maui developers and investors Everett Dowling and Morgan Stanley who tried unsuccessfully to run it until September 2009. The hotel was subsequently sold in July 2010 to a group of investors led by AREA Property Partners, Trinity Investments LLC, and Stanford Carr Development LLC. Then Landmark Hotels Group, Inc. took control of its management until January 2012 and renamed it the Makena Beach &amp; Golf Resort with Declan McCarthy as the current General Manager.\nThe resort, located near the Wailea Golf Courses, had 290 rooms and 20 suites.

In addition, the Makena Kai Day Spa was operated by Hawaiian Rainforest Spa which specializes in Hawaiian healing arts and provides massage therapy, facials, and body treatments. The resort had four restaurants and two bars (with local Hawaiian music nightly).\nIn 2014, a group led by Hawaii developer Stanford Carr expressed to the Maui Planning Commission the intention to transform the resort into luxury apartments and hotel.\nIn 2016, it was announced by ATC Makena Holdings, LLC, owners of the 1,800-acre Makena Resort, that it would close the 310-room Makena Beach &amp; Golf Resort (formerly the Maui Prince Hotel) at noon on July 1.

        "title": "Rowing at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's single sculls",
        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place at Virgilio Uribe Rowing and Canoeing Course, Mexico. The event was held from 15 to 19 October. There were 17 competitors from 17 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Jan Wienese of the Netherlands, with Jochen Meißner of West Germany taking silver and Alberto Demiddi of Argentina earning bronze. It was the first medal in men's single sculls for each of the three nations. The Soviet Union's four-Games winning streak in the event ended; three-time champion Vyacheslav Ivanov was left off the team in favor of Viktor Melnikov; Melnikov finished fourth in his semifinal and did not reach the main final.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThree of the 13 single scullers from the 1964 Games returned: two-time silver medalist Achim Hill of the United Team of Germany (now competing for East Germany), fourth-place finisher Alberto Demiddi of Argentina, and twelfth-place finisher Vaclav Kozak of Czechoslovakia. The field was unusually open with many top-flight scullers absent. The Soviet Union sent Viktor Melnikov rather than three-time reigning gold medalist Vyacheslav Ivanov. The United States had John Van Blom rather than reigning World Champion Donald Spero. Great Britain was represented by Kenny Dwan instead of reigning Diamond Challenge Sculls winner Hugh Wardell-Yerburgh. The most accomplished competitors present were Hill and Demiddi (who had also won the Pan American Games). Roger Jackson of Canada and Kozak were Olympic champions, but in other events (1964 coxless pairs for Jackson, 1960 double sculls for Kozak). \nCuba and Romania each made their debut in the event; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. Great Britain made its 13th appearance, most among nations, after missing only its second edition of the event in 1964.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament, with more rowers than the previous few Games, expanded back to four rounds: three main rounds and a repechage. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first two rowers in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The others competed again in the repechage for the remaining six spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe three fastest rowers from each repechage heat advanced to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nThe first three rowers from each semifinal advanced to Final A, while the rest advanced to Final B.\nFinals.\nFinal A was for the top six rowers, who still had a chance to get the medals. Final B was used to determine the 7th until 12th place of this rowing event."

        "text": "Cricket is a minor sport in Iraq, with the majority of national focus on football, followed by basketball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding, taekwondo, boxing, kickboxing, and tennis. Sporting activity in general has been limited somewhat by the Iraq War and succeeding conflicts. Iraq is not a member of the International Cricket Council, and what cricket is found has been introduced to schools largely through the British Armed Forces, or played between the militaries of the various Commonwealth forces stationed there – most often Australian, British and New Zealand troops.\nCricketArchive records matches as having been played in Iraq as early as July 1931, when a two-day match was played in Baghdad between Royal Air Force officers and \"casuals\" (enlisted ranks). At least one first-class cricketer has been born in Iraq – Zayyad Qayyum (born in Baghdad in 1979), who played Pakistani domestic cricket and represented the Pakistani national under-19 team.\nIn 2003, a sergeant of the British Royal Logistic Corps petitioned the Marylebone Cricket Club for cricket equipment to be sent to troops in southern Iraq to create a cricket training centre. The equipment was sent to forces in the country, presented by former Test player Mike Gatting. In April 2007 \"Wisden\" writer Tony Munroe covered the efforts of Major Andrew Banks, who toured schools in Iraq with a detachment of the Royal Air Force handing out cricket equipment and explaining the laws of cricket to teachers. He recorded that \"after some simple explanation of the basic rules of cricket (through an interpreter) and a quick demonstration by members of the RAF, the Iraqi children joyfully hit the ball around the playground. I duly handed over the set to the games mistress and she in turn professed to be keen to allow her charges to play on a regular basis.\" He noted that \"The teachers have seen a lot of projects come out of the West so they were sceptical until they saw the kids having fun\" and that \"They never quite understood the lbw law but they enjoyed themselves and that was what mattered.\"\nInter-force cricket matches between various units of the British Army have taken place in the country, and in September 2007 a British Army team were defeated by a team from the Australian military near Basra. The match raised 14,000 US Dollars for charities."

        "title": "UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball",
        "text": "The UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball team represents the University of California, Santa Barbara in the sport of baseball. The Gauchos compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) through the Big West Conference. They are currently led by head coach Andrew Checketts, who led his fifth season with the Gauchos in 2016.\nHistory.\nEmergence of a team.\nFew records exist from the start of Santa Barbara's baseball program. Through its different incarnations, Santa Barbara has fielded a team as early as 1922. The first known head coach is Kenneth Bolton, who coached in only the 1922 season before handing the reins to O. J. Gilliland in 1923. C.J. Anderson, Ralph DeBolt, Henry Minetti, Lewis Peters, Arthur Peterson, Harold Sanford, Fred Seegert, Louis Sherril, William Thrasher, Linn Unkefer, and John Vince are the first known players and were listed on the 1923 team.\nSanta Barbara State Teachers College, as one of the precursors to the present day UC Santa Barbara, played in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference as far back as the 1932–33 season. It is likely to have had even earlier teams in the SCIAC as records show Santa Barbara joined the conference in 1931.\nSanta Barbara's first reliable team of record can be traced back to 1947, then led by Spud Harder. Wearing multiple hats, Harder served as Santa Barbara's athletic director, head football coach, and head baseballcoach. The team played in the California Collegiate Athletic Association from at least 1947 until 1958 when it left to compete in the California Intercollegiate Baseball Association.\nRoy Engle, a dual sport head coach in football and baseball in the mold of Spud Harder, took over the program in 1952 and led the Gauchos to their first ever post-season berth. The Gauchos lost both games they played against the Fresno State Bulldogs baseball team by a combined score of 28-6.\nConference volatility.\nRene Rochelle took over the program in 1954 and coached the team through the CCAA to CIBA transition. He spent 6 seasons as head coach before Dave Gorrie took the lead for the 1960 season.\nGorrie was at the helm for over 700 games in Gaucho blue and gold, and provided a bit of stability to the team as it bounced from conference to conference in the 1960s and 1970s. Throughout his 18 seasons as head coach, saw six league status changes. He endured through a rough start to his tenure, with the team compiling a 32–95 record in conference play his first seven seasons – the worst such stretch in Gaucho baseball history. A change in for the 1967, going from CIBA competition to becoming an independent, marked the end of the slide. Independent ball lasted just one season with the Gauchos joining the West Coast Athletic Conference in 1968. The stay was short – just two seasons – before the Gauchos were on the move again.\nBeginning with the 1970 season, the Gauchos competed in the Big West Conference through 1974. This period contained Gorrie's best season with the Gauchos - a 31–16 season which saw the Gauchos go 14–4 in Big West play, resulting in their second-ever NCAA post season berth. In the 1972 NCAA University Division baseball tournament, the Gauchos recorded their first-ever postseason wins against Santa Clara Broncos, before losing to eventual National Champions USC Trojans. It also marked the first time in UC Santa Barbara history that their baseball team was nationally ranked at the end of the season after being ranked 17th at the conclusion of the year.\nAndrew Checketts era.\nIn the 2015 NCAA Division I baseball season, the Gauchos set a program record for wins en route to hosting their first ever NCAA Regional in the 2015 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Star pitcher Dillon Tate was drafted 4th overall in the 2015 Major League Baseball draft.\nThe 2016 NCAA Division I baseball season saw the Gauchos build on their success. They were thought to be too young to compete at a high level for 2016 and placed 4th in the Big West Conference's preseason coaches' poll. UCSB advanced to the 2016 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with an at-large bid, then subsequently made NCAA Super Regional and NCAA College World Series appearances for the first time in the school's history. Gaucho fans adopted a soccer chant commonly used at UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer games while in Omaha.\nThe Gauchos returned to the NCAA tournament in 2019 by winning their first outright Big West regular season title with a record of 45-9, 19–5 in conference. The Gauchos won 13 series over the entire season, only dropping 2 series all year. The team was drawn into the Stanford regional, and lost the opener 9–2 to Fresno State, and again lost 6–4 to Sacramento State, ending their season.\nNotable former players.\n\"This list of notable former players comprises players who went on to play professional baseball after playing for the team. Players denoted in bold represent MLB All-Stars. Players denoted in italics represent World Series Champions.\"\nThe Blue-Green Rivalry.\nThe main rival of the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball team is the Cal Poly Mustangs baseball team. The rivalry is a part of the larger Blue–Green Rivalry, which encompasses all sports from the two schools."

The team competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and in the Big West Conference. They are currently led by head coach Tommy Nicholson, who has held the position since 2022.\nThe Aggies competed at the NCAA Division II level through 2005. At that level, they appeared in the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship 7 times, including two appearances in the College World Series, where they earned fifth-place finishes each time. At the Division I level, the Aggies have made one appearance in the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship, in 2008, where they finished 1–2 in regional competition.\nIn 2008, future major leaguer Ty Kelly led the Big West Conference with a .397 batting average as a sophomore, and was #2 in the Big West Conference in hits with 94; his career batting average and hits total rank second and third, respectively, in Aggies history.\nControversy.\nIn July 2021, the entire UC Davis Aggies baseball program was suspended and the coaching staff was placed on administrative leave due to allegations of misconduct. An internal investigation found that players engaged in hazing rituals that included binge drinking, eating live goldfish, strippers, and threats of sexual assault. The team was allowed to resume some activities in October under the supervision of an interim coaching staff. Manager Matt Vaughn resigned in November after the administration found he had failed to address concerns regarding a complaint about hazing from 2018."

        "text": "Scott Owens (born March 7, 1956) is an American former ice hockey player and coach. Owens was the long-time head coach of Colorado College.\nCareer.\nScott Owens made his first appearance for the Colorado College (CC) Tigers during the 1975–76 season. While none of his four years saw CC finish with a winning record, they did earn their only conference title in school history in 1978. Once he had graduated, Owens became a player-assistant coach with TSV Kottern, which played in varying levels of West Germany's amateur leagues, for five years before returning to North America.\nOwens' next job came in his home town of Madison as general manager for the newly formed Madison Capitols of the United States Hockey League (USHL). After two seasons, Owens also took the head coaching position with the Capitols, and under his leadership the team routinely finished in the top half of league standings. Owens left after the 1989–90 season to accept a position with the NCAA Wisconsin Badgers as an assistant under his old head coach Jeff Sauer. In 1991, he moved back to his alma mater Colorado College as an assistant coach. After four more seasons with the Tigers, Owens headed back to the USHL as head coach of the Des Moines Buccaneers.\nDespite a rocky start that saw his first losing record as a head coach, Owen's tenure in Des Moines was even more successful than his time with the Capitols. In his third year, the Buccaneers won the Anderson Cup as the best regular season team and followed it up with a repeat performance in addition to a Clark Cup for winning the league title. Owens then returned Colorado College to take over as head coach. With the departed Don Lucia having revived the moribund program, Owens stepped in and had immediate success, making the NCAA tournament three straight years. The fourth year culminated with Peter Sejna, a player Owens had coached and recruited in Des Moines, winning the Hobey Baker Award, the first in school history.\nTwo years later, Owens has his best season with Colorado College, winning 31 games and qualifying for the 2005 Frozen Four with Colorado College's second Hobey Baker winner, Marty Sertich. After the success in his early years, Colorado College began to slip back into the rest of the pack. While still maintaining winning seasons over the next seven years, CC would only top 20 wins three times and win only one more game in the NCAA tournament before CC posted its first losing season in 20 years at 18–19–5 in 2012–13. The following year was much worse as the Tigers won only seven games and Owens then stepped down as head coach after 15 seasons. At the time of his resignation, Owens was both the longest tenured and winningest coach in Colorado College's ice hockey program history.\nOn May 21, 2015, Owens returned to coaching and the United States Hockey League when he was named head coach of the Sioux Falls Stampede. He retired from coaching on March 26, 2020, and returned to the Des Moines Buccaneers as general manager."
