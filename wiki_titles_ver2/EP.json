        "text": "The Badminton Theater () is a venue utilized for the staging of medium- and large-scale multiplex events. Situated inside the metropolitan park of Goudi in Athens, Greece, the theater was originally designed to host concerts, plays, dance performances and musicals. As of 2012, conferences, meetings, presentations and corporate events are also held at the venue due to the construction of additional facilities.\nHistory and architectural transformation.\nThe venue was initially built as part of Goudi Olympic Complex and used for the sport of Badminton during the 2004 Olympic Games, opening immediately before the games.

ABCD acquired the premises for a 20-year timeframe, and subsequently embarked on radical reform and development of the property.\nReconstruction.\nThe building was eventually converted into a versatile facility, suitable for medium- and large-scale events. The remodeling work began in the summer of 2006 and was completed in 2007, with investment exceeding 16 million euros. The post-industrial style of the exterior and the venue's large open spaces were the only things that remained intact. The interior was entirely rebuilt to create a modern auditorium, capable of seating 2,430 people, surrounded by foyers and halls.\nThe Badminton Theater has been used in several major international theater, dance and television productions and conferences.\nThe Theater.\nThe main areas of Badminton Theater are:\nThe Auditorium.\nThe Badminton Theater Auditorium is the largest of its kind in Greece.

For conferences and corporate events, the stage accommodates panels of speakers and presentations, with a central podium also available to guests. The image viewer can also be used to convert the scene into a viewing area. High quality projectors are employed for the lighting of the area; lighting equipment includes 200-inch dimmers, a \"Congo ETC\" lighting console, and five LED panels for displays and the projection of subtitles.\nThe ergonomic design of the theater provides unobstructed visibility and, for events that require a greater immediacy for a smaller audience, a mobile partition can be employed.\nThe acoustics of the venue are capable of an average reverberation time of less than 1.1 seconds audio in the room is evenly distributed to within ± 2 decibels (db) from point-to-point and the central console is a digital 96-channel \"MIDAS XL 8\". The acoustic design of the theater was completed by Theodore Timagenis, an acoustic design consultancy firm founded in 1975.\nThe Foyer.\nThe foyer consists of two multi-use areas that collectively occupy more than 1,500 square meters (sq. m.) of space.\nThe Upper Foyer, the main reception area for visitors, consists of banners with an internal lighting mechanism and flat screens for the viewing of video material. The Upper Foyer also overlooks Army Park and is illuminated by natural lighting. This main reception area is connected to the lower level by two open stairwells and an elevator. The Lower Foyer connects with the lower tier of the amphitheater and consists of allocated smoking rooms.\nThe Hallway.\nThe Hallway is the main reception area for visitors.

        "title": "Guggenheim Baseball Management",
        "text": "Guggenheim Baseball Management is the ownership group of the Los Angeles Dodgers professional baseball team. The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, and also includes as investors basketball hall of famer Magic Johnson, movie producer Peter Guber, baseball team executive Stan Kasten, and investors Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly. Billie Jean King and her partner Ilana Kloss joined the Los Angeles Dodgers ownership group in 2018. Entrepreneurs Alan Smolinisky and Robert L. Plummer joined the ownership group in September 2019.\nBackground and history.\nIn the late 1990s Rupert Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group bought the Dodgers from the team's original owner, the O’Malley family. Fox in 2004 sold the team to Frank McCourt, a Boston real estate developer. Bud Selig, Major League Baseball's commissioner at the time, later accused McCourt of saddling the Dodgers with debt and dipping into team funds to pay for personal expenses.\nIn April 2011 MLB Commissioner Selig announced that MLB would be appointing a representative to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. His statement said that he took that action because of his \"deep concerns for the finances and operations\" of the Dodgers. This event occurred shortly after an \"LA Times\" report that McCourt had obtained a personal loan from Fox to cover the team's payroll for April and May. McCourt vigorously disputed MLB's actions. Nevertheless, Selig appointed former diplomat and former Texas Rangers executive Tom Schieffer to oversee the Dodgers' finances. On June 27, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection.\nAfter much legal wrangling between McCourt's lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy court, he reached a deal with the league to put the team up for sale.\nThere were three final bidders for the team: Stan Kroenke, a St. Louis real-estate already owned the then-St. Louis Rams NFL football team, the Denver Nuggets NBA basketball team, the Colorado Avalanche NHL hockey team, and the English soccer club Arsenal; hedge fund manager Steven Cohen; and a group that originally included Todd Boehly and Mark Walter, the former president and current C.E.O. of Guggenheim Partners, a Chicago-based global financial services company, and basketball hall of famer Magic Johnson.\nGuggenheim Baseball Management, which included Boehly, Walter and Johnson, was formed to acquire the team in March 2012 from McCourt.\nOn March 27, 2012, McCourt agreed to sell the team to Guggenheim Baseball Management for a record price of $2.15 billion, the highest ever paid for a professional sports team at the time. McCourt separately sold the land surrounding the stadium for $150 million to the same group, while maintaining some economic interest in the property. According to Guggenheim Baseball Management, McCourt will have no control or influence over the land, but will profit from potential future development of it. Also, the new ownership will pay $14 million to rent the parking lots surrounding Dodger Stadium from an entity half-owned by McCourt. The sale officially closed on May 1, 2012, ending McCourt's turbulent period as Dodgers owner.\nTelevision deal.\nOn January 22, 2013, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that Time Warner Cable had signed a deal to partner with the Dodgers to form a new regional sports network, which would be majority-owned by the team.\nOn January 28 the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable signed a 25-year broadcast agreement valued at $8.35 billion, subject to the approval of Major League Baseball, which would see the establishment of a new channel known as SportsNet LA. The deal ended long-standing broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West, which had aired Dodgers games on its \"Prime Ticket\" channel since 1997; and with KCAL-TV, an independent station which had been the Dodgers' over-the-air broadcast television outlet since 2006. TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season, or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from \"Prime Ticket\" and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by \"Prime Ticket\" in 2013.\nThe Dodgers television deal has been controversial, with a distribution dispute that has locked out wide swaths of the Los Angeles television market. SportsNet LA has never been available to the majority of households in its service area. Carriage was most limited in the channel's inaugural 2014 season, when it was carried by Time Warner Cable systems in Los Angeles, Bright House Networks' system in Bakersfield, and Champion Broadband serving a small portion of the San Gabriel Valley. Together, these distributors covered only 30% of the market, leaving the remaining 70% without the channel. Coverage rose when Charter Communications added SportsNet LA in June 2015, but remains under 50 percent: about 1.8 million homes. DirecTV is the largest unsigned distributor. Since Charter's acquisition of TWC on September 20, 2016, SportsNet LA continues to only be carried by the former Charter, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Networks systems in the region (which now operate as Spectrum). The team and Spectrum finally came to terms with DirecTV/U-verse TV to add the network before the 2020 season.\nInvestors and executives.\nGuggenheim Baseball Management investors and executives include:\nMark R. Walter\nWalter is the \"controlling partner\" of Guggenheim Baseball Management and the chairman of the Dodgers. He is the chief executive of Guggenheim Partners, an investment and advisory firm with more than $270 billion in assets under management. Based in New York and Chicago, the firm was founded in 1999 and is now a global investment and advisory financial services firm that engages in investment banking, asset management, capital markets services, and insurance services. \nTodd Boehly\nPreviously president of Guggenheim Partners until leaving in 2015, Boehly bought some of the assets he had collected at Guggenheim, including The Hollywood Reporter, Dick Clark Productions, and Security Benefit, to found Eldridge Industries, a private investment firm that specializes in providing both debt and equity capital. A graduate of William &amp; Mary in Virginia, Mr. Boehly dealt in leveraged finance at Credit Suisse First Boston and high-yield investments at Whitney &amp; Co. He joined Guggenheim in 2001 to lead its corporate-credit business.\nPeter Guber\nGuber is an American business executive, entrepreneur, educator and author. He is chairman and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment. Guber's most recent films from Mandalay Entertainment include \"The Kids Are All Right\", 'Soul Surfer' and \"Bernie\". He has also produced \"Rain Man\", \"Batman\", \"The Color Purple',\" \"Midnight Express', Gorillas in the Mist, The Witches of Eastwick\", \"Missing\", and \"Flashdance.\" Guber's films have grossed over $3 billion worldwide and received 50 Academy Award nominations.\nGuber is also co-owner of four professional sports teams: the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball, the Major League Soccer team Los Angeles FC, and the professional eSports organization aXiomatic Gaming, that acquired controlling interest in one of the world's premier esports team franchises, Team Liquid.\nStan Kasten\nStan Kasten (born February 1, 1952, in Lakewood Township, New Jersey) is the former president of the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Nationals, and the current president and part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Long involved in Atlanta professional sports, he also served as general manager of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and president of the NHL's Atlanta Thrashers.\nA native of New Jersey, Mr. Kasten became the youngest NBA general manager in 1979 when he joined the Atlanta Hawks at age 27. In 1986 he took over as president of both the Hawks and Ted Turner 's other franchise, the Atlanta Braves, where he stayed until 2003. He landed in Washington in 2006 as president of the Nationals franchise, stepping down after the 2010 season.\nHe has won two NBA Executive of the Year awards, three NBA division titles, and, with the Braves, 12 baseball division titles, five National League pennants and one World Series Championship.\nRobert (Bobby) Patton, Jr.\nPatton is a partner of Guggenheim Baseball Management and became part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 30, 2012. Patton principally operates oil and gas properties in Texas and Kansas and has additional investments in many other sectors, including ranching and insurance. He serves on the Board of Security Benefit Corporation and the advisory council of the University of Texas College of Liberal Arts. He also serves as the tournament chairman of the Dean &amp; Deluca Invitational PGA Tour event at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. Patton received a B.B.A. from the University of Texas as well as a J.D. from St. Mary's University and LLM from Southern Methodist University. Patton resides in Fort Worth, where he was born and raised."

        "text": "Dorset and Wilts Rugby Football Union (Dorset &amp; Wilts RFU) is the governing body for rugby union in the counties of Dorset and Wiltshire, England. Dorset &amp; Wilts RFU is a Constituent Body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and is responsible for the management and administration of the game within the counties of Dorset and Wiltshire of all forms and at all levels. Originally Dorset and Wiltshire had their own county teams but would start to merge into one body towards the end of the 1930s, having already played a combined match against Hampshire in 1935–36 which Dorset &amp; Wilts won 9–6. By 1939 Dorset &amp; Wilts agreed to become a unified rugby football union to take part in the 1940–41 County Championships but this was postponed by the outbreak of World War II. After the war Dorset &amp; Wilts played its first official county match in 1947 and attained full county status from the RFU in 1949.\nRole and responsibility.\nDorset &amp; Wilts RFU's role is to promote and develop rugby within Dorset and Wiltshire by supporting its clubs and encouraging all those who wish to participate including players, coaches, referees and administrators. It works in partnership with the RFU and liaises with local authorities and other county and regional organisations to achieve this. Its remit includes:\nTo help achieve these aims it holds an annual conference for club officials and manages and administrates specific RFU projects including RFU funded campaigns to help clubs recruit and retain players, coaches and administrators. It also nominates candidates and tutors from its Clubs to attend the regional RFU leadership academy.\nD&amp;WRFU has a strategic plan supported by annual action plans and works with the RFU to:\nBadge and colours.\nThe blazon for the Dorset and Wilts RFU arms are; \"vert, an orle argent per fess (at nombril point), three lions passant guardant in pale argent, a bustard wings elevated and addorsed also argent.\" The arms are generally shown on a shield described either as a \"badge\" or \"elegant\".\nThe green and white colour of the arms and playing kit are taken from the arms of the Wiltshire County Council which were chosen to represent the white chalk and green grass of the North Wessex Downs. The three lions representing Dorset are derived from the old seal of Dorchester (the county town) which had borne the former royal arms of England; these are placed in a superior position to the Wiltshire bustard in order to compensate for the use of Wiltshire's colours (the colours from the Flag of Dorset are not represented as it was only adopted by the county in 2008, long after the formation of the Dorset and Wilts RFU, though it could now be argued that the white represents Dorset and the green stands for Wiltshire). The bustard represents Wiltshire because it was in this county that the bird was last seen in the late 1890s before being declared extinct in the United Kingdom (the great bustard was adopted as the crest of Wiltshire in recognition of this fact) and it is on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire that efforts are currently under way to reintroduce the species.\nTwin counties sides.\nSenior men's side.\nThe senior side regularly enters the RFU's County Championship Division 3 and have won it on three occasions, in 2010, 2011 and 2018.\nIn 2010 the \"Twin Counties\" won two of their three pool matches against Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Sussex, and then defeated Oxfordshire in the semi-final. They defeated Leicestershire 36–26 scoring five tries to only one conceded at Twickenham on 30 May 2010. Leicestershire had booked their finals spot with a 37–35 victory over Cumbria.\n2010 final team\nReplacements:\nIn the 2011 competition they beat Berkshire 33–22 and Oxfordshire 54–12 in the pool matches. They then beat Essex 61–37 in the semi-final and won the final at Twickenham on Sunday 29 May 2011, beating Surrey 43–22.\n2011 final team\nReplacements:\nUnder 20 side.\nIn 2011 the Dorset and Wilts U20 side played 4 and won 3 in the U20 County Championship competition. They beat Berkshire 21–15, then Oxfordshire 21–32 and Buckinghamshire 0–36 before losing 58–10 to Gloucestershire in the quarter-finals.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 51 clubs affiliated with the Dorset &amp; Wilts RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. Although several teams from Somerset play in the Dorset &amp; Wilts regional leagues, these sides are still members of the Somerset RFU.\nSenior County Club Competitions.\nSince 2001–02 the league system in this region has been contested by clubs from Dorset and Wiltshire (as well as the occasional team from Somerset) and is run by the Dorset &amp; Wilts RFU. Prior to this clubs from Berkshire had also taken part but they now play in a league with clubs from Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. Currently there are several regional divisions which combine 1st, 2nd, 3rd and even 4th teams in the region including:\nCups.\nThere are a number of cups for the first teams of clubs based in Dorset and Wiltshire run by the Dorset &amp; Wilts RFU including:\nAdditionally there are cup and plate competitions for 2nd teams in the region as well as a cup competition for 3rd teams.\nColts County Club Competitions.\nAt colts level (under 18) there is an annual league and knockout cup competition.\nColts cup competition.\nPreliminary matches are usually played in January and February with the finals taking place in mid-April. At each stage only the winners of each match progress to get to the cup final match. There are two consolation matches, the plate final (to determine third and fourth place) and the bowl final. Trophies are presented to the winning team of each of the three final matches and individual medals to the winners of the cup final.\nDue to RFU restrictions on playing time at Under 18 level, no extra time will be played in the event of a tied match.\nHistory of the Colts cup competition"

        "text": "The Eredivisie (\"Premier League\") was, during its existence, the only professional ice hockey league in the Netherlands and the highest level of competition organized by the Nederlandse IJshockey Bond (NIJB; English: \"Dutch Ice Hockey Federation\"). Formed in 1945 and playing continuously since 1964, the league mainly featured Dutch teams, although in some seasons certain Belgian teams competed. The league featured a mix of Dutch, European and overseas players. The winner of the Eredivisie was crowned the Dutch National Champion and represented the Netherlands in the IIHF Continental Cup. In 2015, with most of its teams facing financial problems and its top team, Tilburg Trappers, joining the German Oberliga, the Eredivise was suspended with the remaining teams joining the BeNe League.\nTeams.\nThe league had many different teams during its existence. The financial viability of teams and availability of an arena often determined which cities participated in any given year. The teams in its final year of competition were:\nFormat.\nThe league's format changed from year to year depending on the number of teams and the format of the Dutch Cup Tournament. As an example, in the 2013-14 year, the league had a 36-game regular season, followed by a best-of five semi-finals amongst the top five qualifiers and a best-of-five final for the Dutch championship.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe Dutch ice hockey Eredivisie was formed after World War II, with teams in Amsterdam, The Hague and Tilburg. It suspended operations from 1950 to 1964, but has organized a season of competition annually ever since. Over the years the number of teams competing fluctuated between 3 and 10 (currently 7), and the number of games played in the regular season between 4 and 36.\nRecent History.\nFor the 2008-2009 Eredivisie season, the Utrecht Dragons and Eindhoven Kemphanen joined the league. In 2009-2010, Utrecht returned to the Eerste Divisie. Prior to the 2010-2011 season, Amstel Tijgers, one of the oldest teams in the league, dropped out, as did Groningen Grizzlies after three seasons, due to poor results on the ice and low revenues. In 2010, a new team, the Zoetermeer Panthers, won the Dutch Cup but dropped out of the first North Sea Cup tournament due to financial problems.\nFor two seasons, 2010–11 and 2011–12, the league's regular season consisted of a tournament with several Belgian teams called the North Sea Cup. The two countries maintained distinct national cups and national championship playoffs during these years. The Belgian teams, namely HYC Herentals, Turnhout White Caps, and Leuven Chiefs, struggled on and off the ice in the new league, with smaller budgets and fewer imported players than their Dutch counterparts. By the end of the second North Sea Cup season, Leuven and Turnhout had dropped out of the league. The North Sea Cup was disbanded in the summer of 2012 when the lone remaining Belgian team, HYC Herentals, was admitted as a full member of the Dutch Eredivisie.\nFor 2013-14, the Amsterdam G's, which replaced the Amstel Tijgers for 2011-2012 and 2013-2013, ceased operations after financial problems and back-to-back last place finishes, while the Dordrecht Lions began play in the Eredivisie. However, financial strains on several clubs and a wide disparity between the quality of the teams took a toll on competition and attendance. In 2015, the consistently strongest team of the league, Tilburg Trappers, joined the German Oberliga. This prompted the remaining teams of the Eredivisie to join with the top amateur teams in the Netherlands and Belgium to form the BeNe League, to provide greater financial stability and more balanced competition.\nOther Leagues.\nIn the Netherlands, below the Eredivisie was the Eerste Divisie (First Division), the country's top amateur ice hockey league. There was no relegation or promotion between the Eredivisie and the Eerste Divisie. Some cities (such as Tilburg and The Hague) had hockey clubs operating a professional team in the Eredivisie and a separate amateur team in the Eerste Divisie. All other Dutch hockey leagues are recreational leagues. Dutch Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie teams competed against each other for the Dutch Cup, a tournament that was played before and during the Eredivisie regular season.\nIn Belgium, the Belgian National League operated as the league with the top Belgian teams, apart from HYC Herentals which played in the Eredivisie. Herentals competed in the Belgian Cup tournament but in the Dutch national championship tournament.\nUpon the demise of the Eredivisie, the remaining Eredivisie teams merged with the Eerste Divisie and Belgian National League teams to form the BeNe League.\nChampions.\nDutch Eredivisie national champions since 1946:"

The tour consisted of three Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and two Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Tests were played for the Warne–Muralidaran Trophy.

At the end of that series, Ricky Ponting, the second highest run scorer in Tests and former Test captain, retired.\nMeanwhile, Sri Lanka enjoyed some success at a home series against New Zealand, winning an ODI series and drawing a Test series 1-1.\nSquads.\nOn 20 November 2012, Sri Lanka announced a 16-man Test squad.\nAustralia announced a 12-man squad for the first Test in Hobart on 6 December 2012.

After lunch, Hughes and Shane Watson put on a partnership, before Sri Lanka dismissed both with a wicket on either side of tea. Michael Clarke and Mike Hussey added 101 runs in the evening session, and at stumps Australia was 4/299.\nRain delayed the start of Day 2 by 50 minutes.

Siddle was later cleared by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n2nd Test.\nMatch Report:\nSri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat.

The second level Nationalliga, and the third level Oberliga operate below it. Austrian men's, women's, junior, and women's U-18 national teams participate at the IIHF World Championships. Austria has been a member of the IIHF since March 18, 1912.\nHockey at the time of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.\nAfter being reported in 1897 for the first time by ice hockey, only three years later, the Training Ice Club and the Vienna Athletic Sport Club carried the first official game. The game was played at that time with seven men; In addition to the known positions, there was also a so-called rover, who was the best ice skater on the course a kind of all-round player. In 1909, better training conditions were created with the opening of the first artificial ice rink, and the new sport experienced an unprecedented boom in Austria, which at that time was still part of the Austro-Hungary monarchy.\nIn 1912, the Austrian Ice Hockey Association was founded and added in the same year as a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation. However, this happened a little too late, so Austria-Hungary's first participation in the 1912 European Hockey Championship had to be canceled in retrospect. Only a year later, the monarchy officially participated in the tournament, but finished among the four participants last place.\nInternational successes after the First World War.\nThe First World War interrupted the efforts, and after the disintegration of the monarchy, the Austrian federation had to be re-established in 1919. Only for season 1921/22 was the change from Bandy to Canadian ice hockey with the now-known puck of the association side. After 1921/22 a bandycup was performed, the bandy championship was canceled in 1922/23 after the game W.B.C against Nicholosen on January 23, 1923. In 1922/23, an Austrian championship was held for the first time, which could be won by the Wiener EV. However, this was in fact a competition limited to the Vienna area, and only gradually did teams from other parts of Austria join.\nThe end of the twenties brought the greatest success for Austrian hockey. This began in 1927 with the win of the European Championship, where not a single game had been lost. 1930 defeated the Austrian national team as the first European team a team from North America: a game against Canada could be won 1-0. In 1931, the European title was brought to Austria again, and at the 1931 World Ice Hockey Championships, the team could achieve third place behind Canada and the United States. 1932 and 1933 followed by two silver medals at the European Championships.\nWorld War II.\nBefore the Second World War there was in Austria the ice hockey of the commoners and those of the workers. Workers 'sport developed very quickly in the 1920s, and in 1928 the first workers' ice hockey clubs were founded. They belonged to the 1919 founded Association of Workers and Soldiers Sports Clubs of Austria (VAS), which renamed itself in 1924 ASKÖ (Workers Association for Sport and Physical Culture in Austria). At the 1931 Workers' Winter Olympiad in Mürzzuschlag occupied the national team of Austrians 1st place and became Olympic champion.\nWith the ban on the Social Democratic Labor Party in Austria on February 12, 1934, all affiliated hockey clubs were banned. As a result, players of the workers' clubs tried to be included in other ice hockey clubs or to found new clubs in the civic camp. Thus, in December 1934, the Association for Sport and Physical Culture of the Trade Union Confederation was started. So reported the sports Tagblatt on December 20, 1934 about a new ice hockey club Hammerbrotwerke. Also the ice hockey section Arsenal in the trade union federation, which was taken up in January 1935, belongs to it, as well as the ice hockey club Meidling.\nThe bourgeoisie took no notice of the hockey of the workers. The Sport-Tagblatt reported on January 22, 1934, that the Austrian workers 'ice hockey team participated in the Latvian workers' winter sports festival in Riga on 17 and 18 February 1931. This note has rarity value. The magazine \"The Ice Hockey Sport\" also reported only once, wondering here about the rapid growth of the hockey worker sports and wished this for their own association.\nGerman championship titles by Viennese clubs.\nAt the end of the thirties the connection to Germany followed. At that time, the ÖEHV no longer existed, instead, some Austrian teams took part in the German league, which meant that the EK Engelmann and the Viennese EV ever won a German championship title in their club's history. During the Second World War, the game operation came to a complete halt. It was not until 1945 that the association was re-founded, and in 1947 the team again conquered the bronze medal at a World Cup.\nDescent into the second division.\nHowever, it followed a sporting crash, which meant that in 1962 Austria even relegated to the C-Group, but there unbeaten managed the immediate resurgence in the second division. It took until 1992 before the national team made it back to the best nations in the world. Since then, however, there has been a constant ups and downs between the A and B groups.\nToday's situation.\nProblems with offspring and finances.\nThe Financial crisis of 2007-2008 has not left its mark on Austrian ice hockey. There were already signs in the last few seasons that the limit of lukrierbaren by sponsors budget was reached, this was mainly due to the withdrawal of the HC Innsbruck from the Bundesliga with the end of the season 2008/09 obvious. The two Slovenian teams reported massive financial problems after this season. Other associations, such as the EC VSV, have been working with smaller budgets for quite some time to avoid the threat of bankruptcy.\nAn important consideration here is the number of available Austrian players. Above all, the entry of Red Bull as a sponsor of the EC Red Bull Salzburg participant brought difficulties, as the team took a large part of the better athletic native players with extremely generous offers under contract and drove the salaries of Austrian players disproportionately upwards. Since many teams such as the Vienna Capitals, however, have little own offspring, they could not compensate for this by the advancement of younger players. As a result, the legionnaire was relaxed and replaced by a points system, so that the missing Austrian players were replaced by a large number of transfer card players. This in turn was criticized above all by the associations from Carinthia, which represented for decades one of the most important Kaderschmieden in Austria. However, the hoped-for reduction in budgets was limited, as the example of Innsbruck showed. At the moment, a long-term solution can only improve training for young players. Serious efforts in this direction have been around since 2009 and culminated in the meantime for the 2010/11 season in the establishment of a number of farm teams of all Bundesliga teams and increased cooperation with the clubs of the second and third league. Likewise, some youth players were able to establish themselves in better foreign junior leagues.\nThe next step in 2012 was the founding of the Junior EBEL, a junior league whose participation is compulsory for all Bundesliga teams. This was joined in the premiere year several more teams.\nThe gap between national and national league.\nIn recent years, a not inconsiderable problem between the two highest leagues developed: the budgets of the Bundesliga clubs have risen so much within a few years that they now amount to many times the financial resources of a second division club. For this reason, no national league champions made long use of his right to rise in the top flight. In most cases, the financial risk of disproportionately higher investments is argued. This is a very important aspect, especially after the temporary exit of HC Innsbruck, which has not left its mark on the formation of the second division. While there is no longer any effective legionnaire restrictions in the Bundesliga, the National League clubs have kept their restrictions on three transfer card players and have increasingly tried to force their own offspring.\nIn addition, a separation between East and West had developed in Austria. While in Vorarlberg alone four (and with the newly added HC Innsbruck from the neighboring Tyrol five) national league teams existed, the East was dominated mainly by the Bundesliga clubs. The four Vorarlberg teams built in their financial planning, especially on the numerous well-attended Derbies, which are dropped when a rise of a team in the Bundesliga for this. In addition, these teams argued with the long journey for away games in the East. However, this led to the fact that the second-highest division was played over the years almost exclusively in the West, while the Bundesliga and Oberliga took place only in the East. This problem was exacerbated with the growth of the league to Hungary, Slovenia and Croatia and could only be broken in 2012, when with the Dornbirner EC and returnees HC Innsbruck again two clubs from the West in the EBEL ascended. However, this was accompanied by a crisis of existence of the National League, which had to be realigned in the summer of 2012 within a short time.\nNational league.\nThe highest division of Austrian ice hockey exists in its current form since the season 1965/66. However, the Austrian champions is played with interruptions since 1923. Record champion and at the same time the oldest club in the current field is the EC KAC from Klagenfurt with 30 championship titles.\nThe Erste Bank Ice Hockey League has developed into an international league over the last few years, with four out of twelve participating teams coming from neighboring countries. Likewise, problems with the legionnaires' regime arose over time, which were changed and liberalized several times, especially on the initiative of the Vienna Capitals. This resulted in a greatly increased number of transfer card players in the league. That this did not serve exclusively to push the high salaries for the comparatively small pool of Austrian players and thus to reduce the budgets, proved the temporary voluntary descent of the EBEL participant from Innsbruck. Also, some other teams have always had financial problems, a long-term solution is currently, however, not yet in sight due to the incompatibility of the demands made by the various teams.\nNevertheless, the league continues to develop and has now established itself among the better European leagues. In the 2009/10 season, the brand was exceeded for the first time by one million spectators, whereby the EBEL overtook the Slovakian Tipsport liga and was in seventh place in this ranking in Europe. In addition, the league was accepted as a full member of the European league club Hockey Europe.\nPrevious League.\nFor a long time, the National League was regarded as a stable and financially balanced league in which a considerable proportion of the Austrian youth players were trained by the clubs. This changed in the summer of 2009, when several clubs had to file for bankruptcy. After some confusion about whether the National League could be held in the 2009/10 season at all, but still emerged in the end, a solution, but the development of recent years brought to an unsatisfactory endpoint. The two Styrian representatives KSV ice hockey club and EV Zeltweg moved to the Oberliga, which meant that with the newly founded Zeller polar bears (successor of the insolvent EK Zell am See), the easternmost team of the second division was located in Salzburg. The field of participants shrunk in the meantime to only seven clubs with which the league had de facto lost its status as a total Austrian second division and shared this status with the Oberliga. With the rise of the ATSE Graz, however, a new Styrian club joined in 2010. A year later, followed by a number of farm teams of the Bundesliga teams, but the qualitatively fell off against the established clubs.\nIn the summer of 2012, the EC Dornbirn and HC Innsbruck decided to move up to the Bundesliga, while the EBEL clubs withdrew their farm teams in favor of a Junior EBEL. This development proved fatal for the second highest division. While the Austrian Ice Hockey Association worked to extend the national league to neighboring countries, the Styrian association developed the alternative model of a purely Austrian elite league. In the end, the National League was re-established as an Inter-National League and now also includes Slovenian clubs. In the 2013/14 season, the field of participants widened when in addition five teams of the Italian Hockey League and four other Slovenian teams participated. For the 2014/15 season, the Italian association initially stopped another participation his clubs. A year later, the supranational Alps Hockey League was founded as a successor to the INL by the three hockey associations of Austria, Slovenia and Italy.\nAustria Oberliga.\nAfter the Oberliga struggled for a long time that more and more teams migrated to the respective leagues, emerged in the summer of 2009 due to the problems in the National League an unexpected boom. The league, which had always acted as a link between the professional and amateur hockey in Austria, was greatly upgraded by the participation of former national team KSV ice hockey club and EV Aicall Zeltweg and was officially still run as the third highest league, but in fact formed together with the National League the second highest performance level. This was based primarily on the strict east-west separation of the two leagues. But while the National League holds on the maximum number of three transfer card players per team, the Oberliga lowered the limit to one and wanted from the 2010/11 season as a purely Austrian league without legionaries get along. When after the 2009/10 season some teams left the league, were increasingly called by the Bundesliga teams farm teams to life, bringing the league had the status of a training league. However, the farm teams changed after only one year in the national league, and the game operation of the league had to be set.\n2018 was introduced with the Austrian Amateur Hockey League (ÖAHL), a new nationwide third division.\nNational team.\nAfter the men's national team had been able to hold their own for a few years in the lower regions of the top division, the beginning of the 21st century saw a constant ups and downs between the top 16 nations and Division I. Most recently, the team rose to the top of the ice hockey team. World Cup 2009 in Switzerland. Although this only happened because the actually worse placed Germans were set for the 2010 World Cup in their own country, the consequences were drawn from it, although here the association and the Bundesliga could not first agree on the responsibilities. Lars Bergström was replaced as coach of the team of Bill Gilligan, who for the first time was not given the requirement, as soon as possible to ascend again. Instead, an attempt should be made to build up a new team over the next few years by intensifying the involvement of the youth players and to make their way into the 21st century. The latter was not possible by outdated structures. The re-emergence in the A group succeeded nevertheless, with which Austria again competed in the top group at the 2011 World Cup.\nThe situation is similar with the men's junior teams. The U-20 national team made it to the top division at the World Cup 2009 Division Aalborg (Denmark) with four wins and only one overtime defeat , but rose again the following year after an inferior performance from. The same applies to the U18 national team, which in 2010 even had to relegate to Division II.\nThe women's national team showed good performance at the World Cup Division I in Graz, but missed the rise but still clearly. The U-18 team landed at the tournament of Division I in France, however, on the penultimate place.\nOverall, the Austrian Ice Hockey Federation rates the performances as rather mixed. Above all, the senior men's team recently proved that in the training methods and the player selection crucial changes must be made. However, the fans and the media are particularly critical of the fact that Bill Gilligan has once again been assigned a coach whose main focus is on a club team, the EC Graz 99ers, rather than looking for a coach who focuses on developing the national team can.\nFor the ladies, the latest developments show that the path taken bears fruit, although there is still the fundamental problem that women's ice hockey in Austria is a pure amateur sport. However, this problem is shared with many European nations."

        "text": "John Scott (born 17 February 1981 in Harrow, London) is an English darts player currently playing in World Darts Federation events. His nickname is Gnasher.\nCareer.\nScott made his major debut at the 2012 UK Open at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton. He lost out 4–2 to Brian Woods in the preliminary round. He qualified via the UK Open Order of Merit in tied 96th place with a total of £600 - winning £200 in three of the eight qualifying events. Scott also qualified for the Austrian Darts Open by defeating Mark Hylton in the qualifying event. He lost 6–5 in the first round of the main event to Denis Ovens.\nIn 2013, Scott once again qualified for the 2013 UK Open at the Reebok Stadium in Bolton, making his televised debut in a 5–2 defeat to James Hubbard. Soon after, Scott qualified for the German Darts Championship, defeating Adrian Gray and Lee Palfreyman in the qualifying event. He lost 6–5 to Arron Monk in the first round.\nHis tour card status expired at the beginning of 2014 and he was unsuccessful at Q School as he couldn't advance beyond the last 64 on any of the four days. Scott played in 14 of the 16 Challenge Tour events throughout the year with a solitary last 16 run being his best result.\nIn 2015, Scott was once again unsuccessful in regaining his Tour Card status at Q-School, but managed to qualify once again for the German Darts Championship, defeating Matt Padgett, Kevin Painter and Mark Walsh in the qualifying event, but losing first round to Maik Langendorf in the main event. He played in all 16 Challenge Tour events this year, reaching the last 16 once.\nDespite not attending the PDC Q-School in January 2016, Scott took part in the amateur Riley's qualifying events for the 2016 UK Open, where he won through from the London Victoria venue to make the finals in Minehead. He drew Dean Winstanley in the first round, and was narrowly defeated 6–5.\nIn 2017, Scott made a return to the darts circuit, this time taking part in a handful of BDO tournaments, but the year ended with defeat in the last 32 of the 2018 BDO World Darts Championship qualifying event in Bridlington.\nAfter some good early form in 2018, including reaching the semi-finals of the Romanian Classic, he broke into the top 100 in the World Rankings, and also qualified for the 2018 UK Open, winning the amateur qualifying event in London Victoria once again. At the finals in Minehead, Scott registered his first major tournament victory, defeating Darren Johnson 6-4, before he lost to Jason Lowe in the last 96.\nDespite not managing to qualify for Lakeside, John did qualify for the World Masters where he lost first round to Australia's Justin Thompson. Shortly after this, he reached his first ranking final at the Latvia Open, losing 2-6 to Darius Labanauskas and this result propelled him into the top 50 in the World Rankings for the first time.\n2019 saw John claim his first BDO ranking title, winning the Estonia Open in Tallinn. He followed it up the very next day with a win of the Estonia Masters. In June 2019, Scott moved into a career high position of number 2 in the World Darts Federation rankings and continued his good form by qualifying for the 2019 BDO World Trophy, defeating Ted Hankey in the qualifiers before losing 3-5 to Wayne Warren in the main event last 32.\nDespite a slow start after the enforced break during the Coronavirus pandemic, John missed out on qualification at the 2022 WDF World Darts Championship by one place in the rankings. January 2022 then saw him win his third WDF ranking title, winning the Reykjavik International Games in Iceland, moving him back up to 12th in the world rankings. Due to the Russo-Ukrainian War, the WDF on IOC advice suspended Russian players from the World Championship and this enabled Scott to play in the World Championship for the first time where he was defeated 0-2 by Johnny Haines in the last 48.\nIn May 2022, Scott won his fourth ranking title at the Kaunas Open in Lithuania, defeating Dennis Nilsson 5-0 in the final. He followed this up in 2023 with his seventh ranking final at the Faroe Islands on in March, then a fifth ranking title at the Tallinn Open in April, and a sixth the Lithuania Open in May \nPersonal life.\nJohn is an Arsenal fan and has had a season ticket since 1995."

        "text": "James Brown (born November 30, 1988) is a former American football guard. He went undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, and was signed by the Chicago Bears after the draft. He played college at Troy. He was also a member of the Cleveland Browns.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born on November 30, 1988, in Chicago, Illinois, to Paulina Harness and Ellis Jackson. Brown has three siblings: Ellis Ray Magee, Joseph Harness, and Elaine Brown. He attended Amite County High School in Liberty, Mississippi, where he was teammates with Gabe Jackson. Brown started playing football in eighth grade, and said that football saved his life in 2004, when he opted to workout instead of visiting family, where a cousin of his and a friend were involved in an altercation that later led to them being sentenced to death.\nAt Amite County, Brown was a two-way lineman. As a freshman, he was named Amite County's Rookie of the Year. He also won 2005 Mississippi state weightlifting championship in 2005. In his sophomore year, he earned Defensive Player of the Year after recording 103 tackles and 14 sacks on the season. After he had a class 2A high 108 pancake blocks in his junior year, he was an All-State selection, and repeated in his senior year.\nRegarded as a two-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\", Brown was not ranked among the top offensive lineman prospects of his class. He initially drew interest from Mississippi and Louisiana State, but that began to fade when his academic struggles became clear. On National Signing Day 2008, Brown chose to attend Southern Mississippi, over offers from Alcorn State, Arkansas State, and Jackson State, but never managed to meet the qualification standards. Instead, he had to opt for the junior college route.\nCollege career.\nBefore enrolling at Troy University, Brown played at Southwest Mississippi Community College, and was eventually named to the second-team All-Mississippi Junior College team in his sophomore year. In his three seasons at Troy, Brown excelled, with 66 pancakes in 13 games in 2009. However, he also led the team with 9 penalties, as well as allowing 3.5 sacks. His best performance that year was in a victory over Florida Atlantic when he recorded a season-high 13 pancakes. Before the 2011 season, Brown was placed on the Outland Trophy watchlist, making him only one of just 10 players on the watch list from non-automatic qualifying programs in the FBS, as well as being the only player from the Sun Belt Conference included on the list. He was later invited to the 2012 Senior Bowl. He majored in Criminal Justice.\nProfessional career.\nBrown was projected as a mid-round pick, being named the 54th best player in the draft by Mel Kiper and the 93rd best by \"Pro Football Weekly\". Despite his athleticism, Brown wasn't drafted in the 2012 NFL Draft, and was named by Scouts and NFL analyst Gil Brandt as the second-best undrafted free agent. Analysts believed that Brown's use of marijuana was a factor of him being undrafted, along with concerns about his speed and strength. Brown was ultimately signed by the Chicago Bears along with 10 others. During rookie minicamps, Brown stood out and impressed Bears head coach Lovie Smith. Smith commented on Brown, stating \"He has stood out in the drills. You notice him. He's slim, athletic, good size, smile on his face and he was a pretty good player in college. However (he went undrafted), we're just glad he's in our camp.\"\nHe was released on August 31. He was eventually assigned to the practice squad. On November 21, Brown was elevated to the active roster after Chilo Rachal left the team. The Bears waived Brown on August 26, 2014."

        "title": "New Zealand cricket team in Pakistan in 1996–97",
        "text": "The New Zealand national cricket team toured Pakistan during the 1996–97 cricket season. The tour consisted of a first-class game against an invitational Pakistani Cricket board XI, followed by two Test matches and three One Day International games. The hosts and tourists shared honours in the Test series, drawing 1–1, though New Zealand won with only a narrow 44-run margin in the first Test, and lost the second by an innings and ten runs. New Zealand's Stephen Fleming enjoyed a successful series with the bat, scoring 182 runs at 60.66 in the Test series and 172 runs at 86.00 in the ODI matches, though the rest of the New Zealand batting line-up were said by the New Zealand press to have let the side down with the bat during the Test matches. Nathan Astle, questioned over his place during the tour, redeemed himself with a half century in the final ODI match to alleviate heavy media pressure.\nThree Pakistan batsmen – Mohammad Wasim, Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmed – all hit Test centuries. Ahmed also topped the Pakistan ODI batting averages. Mushtaq Ahmed was the most prolific wicket taker in the Test matches, with 18 wickets. Fleming and Anwar were both named Player of the Series in the Test and the ODI matches for their performances.&lt;ref name=\"New Zealand in Pakistan 1996/97\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The start of the series was overshadowed by political upheaval with the removal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and rumours of violent unrest in Pakistan. Danny Morrison, New Zealand's \"premier strike bowler\" also pulled out with an injury.\nBackground.\nNew Zealand faced several problems on the eve of their 1996–97 tour of Pakistan. Initially, over questions of safety, the New Zealand Cricket Board considered cancelling the tour in light of the removal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the resulting political fallout. Majid Khan, the then-chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board sent assurances to his opposite number in New Zealand, Christopher Doig, that the country was safe to tour. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs also conducted an investigation and believed the tour was safe. New Zealand had previous called off tours of Sri Lanka in 1986–87, and in 1991–92 five players returned home early, all due to bombings and security concerns.\nThe touring side warmed up with an engagement against the Pakistan Cricket Board XI over 17, 18 and 19 November at the Quaid-e-Azam Stadium, in Sahiwal. A drawn match, New Zealand were dismissed for 171 largely due to Mohammad Zahid's 6/54, with Bryan Young top scoring with 47 but with six of New Zealand's top eight batsman being dismissed for single figures. The PCB XI managed 193 in response, with wickets shared between Morrison and Simon Doull. New Zealand fared better with 211/7 declared in their second innings, built largely around Young's 73, and the PCB XI reached 41 without loss by the close. The touring side's batting, bar the efforts of Young who was struggling with a painful tooth infection, was criticised by the media as \"in strife\" during the match due to their collapse of five wickets in eight overs. Some controversy developed over Lahore newspapers publishing speculations that Doull had tampered with the ball. Earle Cooper, managing the touring side, responded with \"New Zealand cricketers are not cheats.\"\nOf greater concern was Danny Morrison, considered a \"premier\" strike bowler for new Zealand. He managed only eight overs during the warm-up match before having to retire. Given the strength of the Pakistan pace attack, Justin Vaughan was considered for opening the batting alongside Young following their respective performances in the warm-up match. Craig Spearman's form also came into question after a poor performance against the PCB XI and given his recent dropping from the domestic one day championship in New Zealand. Spearman was later not included in the squad announced for the first Test, while Young and Vaughan were set to open the innings together. Pakistan, meanwhile, announced the exclusion of experienced batsman Aamir Sohail, and hinted at giving a debut to Zahoor Elahi, then playing well in domestic cricket. They waited, however, until the morning of the Test before confirming.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nAt the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, New Zealand and Pakistan met for the first Test on 21 November. Batting first, the touring side were routed for 155 thanks two eight wickets shared equally between Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, considered premier bowlers of swing and spin respectively. The media believed there was little in the pitch to explain the sudden loss of wickets, crediting the swing bowling ability of bowlers from both sides. Only wicket-keeper Adam Parore managed to hit runs, top-scoring with 37 batting at number three as a specialist batsman. Pakistan, however, struggled also, making 191 around a knock of 59 from their keeper Moin Khan and contending with a five-wicket haul for Doull. Elahi did make his debut, scoring 22. The batting became easier for New Zealand in their second innings, reaching 311 thanks to 92 from Fleming and 93 from all-rounder Chris Cairns, though Ahmed took six more wickets to give him ten for the match, the second ten-wicket haul of his career. The touring side, setting Pakistan 276 runs to win, managed to restrict them to 231 all out – despite Mohammad Wasim's scoring a century on debut – and took victory by 44 runs. The victory was only the second Test win for New Zealand on Pakistan soil. Doull was praised for his bowling efforts, as were the batting efforts of Fleming and Cairns.\n2nd Test.\nOne down in the series, Pakistan faced New Zealand at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on 28 November needing victory to square the series. Batting first once more, New Zealand were again undone by Ahmed's 6/86, failing to 249 all out with 67 from Fleming and a career-best 55 from captain and wicket-keeper Lee Germon as the main contributions. Pakistan took control of the game with their second innings thanks to centuries from Anwar and Ijaz Ahmed, and 78 from Saleem Malik. Anwar and Ahmen's partnership was endangering the Pakistan record for the second-wicket before it was broken by Cairns, who took five wickets but for a costly 137 runs as Pakistan reached 430. New Zealand now on the back foot were again routed for 168 thanks to 7/66 from Player of the Match Mohammad Zahid, on his debut. Only Young, with 61, managed to put up resistance. Described as an \"emphatic victory\" by the \"Daily Telegraph\", Pakistan's win by an innings and 13 runs secured the series as a draw. Zahid, the debutant, received much of the praise.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nThe Test series drawn, attention turned to the three-match ODI series. The two teams met at the Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala, on 4 December, where Pakistan took victory by 11 runs. Batting first in a reduced 46-over game, the start being delayed due to bright sunlight impeding the batsman, they reached 228/8 by the end of their innings thanks in the most part to 73 from 78 balls from Malik. This was part of a 91-run stand with Wasim Akram, who passed 2,000 ODI runs. New Zealand, however, floundered at 217 all out following Saqlain Mushtaq's five-wicket haul defeating the efforts of Young, with 58, Fleming and Cairns with 36 each, and a last-minute 20 from 18 balls from Chris Harris. Waqar Younis was noted by the media for his \"unplayable\" deliveries during his 2/48.\n2nd ODI.\nThe second ODI took place on 6 December at the Jinnah Stadium in Sialkot. Batting first, Pakistan reached 240 for the loss of only two batsmen thanks to Anwar's 91, Zahoor Elahi's 86 and Ijaz Ahmed's 59, before a collapse sparked by Chris Harris's 5/42 reduced them to 277/9. Fleming led the response with 88 from 95 balls, however despite a 37 from Parore they were unable to overhaul the home side's total, falling all out to 231 with wickets shared between Akram, Younuis, Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi. Anwar's batting prowess earned him the Player of the Match award.\n3rd ODI.\nThe third and final game took place on 8 December at the National Stadium, Karachi. Batting first, having already won the series, Pakistan ended their innings on 234/4 composed of a 51 from Zahoor Elahi, 73 from Ijaz Ahmed and captain Wasim Akram's explosive and \"magnificent\" 66 from 39 balls. New Zealand, undaunted, began a solid chase and reached the target with seven wickets still in hand thanks to 32 from Young, 60 from Astle (the player of the match), 47 from Parore, 48 from Fleming and 25 from Cairns. Astle, under pressure due to poor form during the series, was praised by the media for his half century, 60 from 66 balls."

His tenure with the Knicks would prove to be brief, as he played only 5 games before being waived on October 28, 1974. Later in the season, he was signed by the Phoenix Suns, where he finished the season. For the year he averaged 3.7 points and 2.0 assists over 49 games. In the offseason, Jackson was traded to the Washington Bullets, but never played in the NBA again. During his playing career, Jackson also played for the Allentown Jets of the Eastern League.\nFollowing the close of his professional career, Jackson became a community leader in Brooklyn as the long-time manager of the Brownsville Recreational Center. In this capacity he ran numerous programs aimed at keeping inner-city youths off the streets and focused toward positive efforts ranging from sports to the arts.\nJackson died on May 1, 2012."

The winner of the U.S. Open in 2011, also by eight strokes, McIlroy became the sixth-youngest winner of two majors at 23 years and 3 months.\nTelevision coverage was provided in the United States by CBS and TNT, and in the United Kingdom by Sky Sports.\nIt was the first major championship at Kiawah Island; the Ocean Course hosted the Ryder Cup in 1991.

Joost Luiten had raced to eight-under-par through 14 holes, but bogeyed each of his final four holes to fall back into the pack. World number one Luke Donald struggled to an opening 74 (+2), but number two Tiger Woods shot 69 (−3) in the morning wave of players.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, August 10, 2012\"\nThe wind gusted throughout the day on Friday, making conditions much tougher than the first round of the tournament. Scoring was the toughest on record since the championship assumed a strokeplay format in 1958, with the average round being over 78; 72 players made the cut which fell at 150 (+6). Leader Pettersson backed up with a 74 (+2) but that was good enough to stay in a tie for the lead with two other players: Vijay Singh, the 1998 and 2004 champion, shot the lowest round of the day, 69 (−3), while Tiger Woods also rose into a tie for the lead with a 71 in which he made three birdies and two bogeys and stroked only 26 putts. The tough conditions and long course created very slow play; one player, Luiten, chose to complete his second round early on Saturday morning (the other two in his threesome chose to finish their rounds in near-darkness on Friday). He birdied the eighteenth for a round of 76 (+4), which put him at even-par 144.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, August 11, 2012\"\n\"Sunday, August 12, 2012\"\nWeather conditions continued to worsen, and a fierce thunderstorm blew in late afternoon on Saturday, causing play to be postponed for the day with 26 of the 72 players still out on the course. Until the delay, scoring had been a little easier: world number 3 Rory McIlroy surged early with five birdies in his opening eight holes, and a remarkable par save on the third after his drive lodged in a tree. However, a bogey on nine, his final hole of the day, dropped him back into a share of the lead with two-time champion Singh, 26 years McIlroy's senior and attempting to become the oldest major winner in history. They led Adam Scott, also enjoying a fast start, by one, as Scott attempted to shrug off his near miss at the year's previous major. Woods struggled early and was three-over par with a lengthy putt for par at the eighth when play was halted. The overnight clubhouse lead was held by Bo Van Pelt, who carded a five-under 67 early to move to three-under for the week.\nWeather delay.\nThe leaderboard when play was halted on Saturday at 4:50 pm EDT:\nConclusion.\nPlay resumed Sunday at 7:45 am EDT\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, August 12, 2012\"\nIan Poulter made an early charge by making five birdies in a row to start his round, but his charge fizzled on the back nine and he finished with four bogeys in the last six holes. Pettersson was in contention early in the round with a front nine 34 despite a rules infraction where he received a two-stroke penalty from moving a leaf in a lateral hazard, though he also fell out of contention on the back nine when McIlroy pulled away. Defending champion Keegan Bradley tied for third after a final-round 68. McIlroy shot a bogey-free 66 (−6) with only 24 putts, winning the championship by a record eight strokes, capped with a birdie putt on the final hole. The previous PGA record winning margin was seven strokes, by Jack Nicklaus at age forty in 1980, his 17th major.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Shivnarine Chanderpaul",
        "text": "Shivnarine Chanderpaul is an international cricketer who has played for the West Indies since 1994, and captained the team for a short time. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 30 occasions in Test cricket and 11 times in One Day International (ODI) matches. He is West Indies' second-most prolific batsman in international cricket, after Brian Lara, having accumulated almost 20,000 runs. He bats with an unorthodox technique, which is often described as \"crab-like\", and is highly regarded for his \"patience and obstinacy at the crease.\" In his list of the 100 greatest Test players, Shane Warne described Chanderpaul as \"a bloke you needed to crowbar away from the crease.\" In 2008 he was named as one of the five Cricketers of the Year by the \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", and as the Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council.\nChanderpaul made his Test debut in March 1994, selected as an all-rounder who could bowl leg breaks, against England. He reached his first century three years later, scoring an unbeaten 137 against India at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. During the initial phase of his career, Chanderpaul was criticised for his inability to convert half-centuries into centuries, but he proved his critics wrong during the 2001–02 series against India when he scored three centuries in five matches, thus earning the man of the series accolade. During that tournament, he batted for 1,513 minutes between dismissals, a record in Test cricket. Despite being well known for his patient batting, Chanderpaul scored a 69-ball century against Australia in 2003, which at the time was the third fastest century in terms of balls faced. His highest score in Test cricket is 203 not out, a total he achieved twice, first against South Africa in 2005, and then against Bangladesh in 2012. He has scored centuries against every Test playing nation with the exception of Sri Lanka, and has scored seven centuries against India, more than any other team.\nIn ODI cricket, Chanderpaul's debut came seven months after his first Test appearance, but he was not required to bat as the West Indies reached the target to beat India. He scored his maiden ODI century shortly after his first Test century, in May 1997 against India, scoring 109 runs. He reached his highest ODI score in 1999, making 150 runs during a West Indian record partnership of 226 with Carl Hooper, against South Africa. That innings, along with his score of 149 not out against India in 2007 are the only times he has finished a century innings with a strike rate of quicker than a-run-a-ball in ODI cricket.\nIn both Test and ODI cricket, Chanderpaul has remained not out more often than being dismissed once he has scored a century: in Tests, he has been not out in 18 of 30 innings, while out of eleven ODI centuries, he was unbeaten eight times. Chanderpaul has not been selected to play Twenty20 International cricket since 2010, and in his 22 appearances prior to that, his highest score was 41 runs. As of February 2015, he is tenth among all-time century makers in international cricket."

The event was held at Lake Lanier between July 21 and July 27, 1996.\nFrance, Norway, and Germany had won 11 of the last 12 World Championship medals and were represented at the 1996 Summer Olympics by Frédéric Kowal and Samuel Barathay, Kjetil Undset and Steffen Størseth, and Sebastian Mayer and Roland Opfer respectively. France, represented in part by Barathay, was the 1993 World Champion and 1994 bronze medalist. Norway was the 1994 World Champion and 1993 runner-up and, with its Olympic duo, the 1995 bronze medalist, while Undset was also an Olympic silver medalist from the 1992 quadruple sculls. Germany had been runner-up at the last two editions of the World Championships and a bronze medalist in 1993. The lone exception to the dominance of these three nations was Denmark, who won the 1995 World Championships with Lars Christensen and Martin Haldbo Hansen. Australia, meanwhile, sent one of its defending Olympic champions, Peter Antonie, to Atlanta with a new partner, Jason Day. Antoine was also one half of the winning crew at the 1995 Double Challenge Sculls at the Henley Royal Regatta. Hungary's Zsolt Dani and Gábor Mitring were the 1994 winners of that tournament.\nIn the opening round, Norway posted the fastest time by nearly five seconds, while the other heats were won by Denmark and the Italian duo of Davide Tizzano and Agostino Abbagnale, both of whom were Olympic champions in the quadruple sculls from 1988. The Hungarians, meanwhile, were eliminated in the repêchage. In the semi-finals it was France who eliminated the Australians with the fastest time in the round, nearly three seconds ahead of its closest competition, while Italy won the other heat. The race in the final was closer, but Italy, Norway, and France were all ahead of the pack and crossed the finish line in that order. Denmark, the reigning World Champions, came in fourth nearly five seconds later.\nHeats.\nHeat 3.\nJames Cracknell was one of the nominated British scullers but he was suffering from tonsillitis; Guy Pooley as backup rower replaced him.\nRepechage.\nRepechage 4.\nThe British replacement rower Pooley also replaced Cracknell in the repechage.\nRerace.\nRerace 1.\nThe British rower Cracknell had by now recovered from his tonsillitis and took over from the replacement rower Pooley."

That first appearance began a string of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament berths. The team earned regular-season C-USA championships 4 times, the last in the 2009–10 season, when they finished with a 23–6 record (14–2 in C-USA). In addition, the program won the C-USA tournament 5 times: 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, and 2009–10. Lisa Stockton was twice named C-USA Coach of the Year (2006–07 and 2009–10).\n2006–07 seniors Jami Montagnino (ranked 5th in NCAA Division I teams in free-throw percentage) and D'Aundra Henry proved essential to the team's success, both hitting 1,000 points for their careers in that season. That team was upset by Rice 64–52 in the C-USA semifinals in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and did not receive an at-large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament. With a final record of 25–6, they became the first team with 25 or more wins and six or fewer losses not to make it into the 64-team bracket, along with a 26–3 Montana team. Following a 62–53 win over UAB in the 2010 C-USA Tournament Final, the team advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2003. During the 2011–12 season, senior Brett Benzio became the second female and third Tulane basketball player ever to reach 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds in a season.\nTeam achievements.\nPostseason tournament appearances.\nUnder Lisa Stockton, the Green Wave have appeared in 18 postseason tournaments.\nGreen Wave in professional basketball.\nThe following Green Wave players have played in the WNBA:"

        "text": "The West Coast Negro Baseball Association (WCNBA) was one of the several Negro baseball leagues created during the time organized baseball was segregated. The WCNBA was organized as a minor league in 1946 by Abe Saperstein and Jesse Owens as a means to provide the west coast with a platform for African-American players. The league lasted about three months.\nLeague history.\nDuring World War II in the mid-1940s, the African American population grew as wartime jobs demanded workers to relocate to the shipyards and military institutions along the California, Oregon and Washington coasts. After the war ended in 1945, Eddie Harris and David P. Portlock began the process of organizing a Negro league in the area using the current minor league Pacific Coast League (PCL) stadiums while those teams were on the road. They reached out to Abe Saperstein to assist. Saperstein already owned a barnstorming team called the Cincinnati Crescents, which he moved to Seattle and renamed them the Seattle Steelheads. He knew Jesse Owens, the track and field athlete and four-time Olympic gold medalist, and asked him to join. Owens formed the Portland Rosebuds in Oregon. Saperstein was elected league president, Owens vice-president and Portlock secretary. A 110-game season was planned. However, the league survived for only about three months. Most teams played under 30 games and the league folded due to \"poor attendance, a lack of financing, and difficulty in accessing ballparks.\" Seattle and Oakland continued the season playing local teams across the midwest.\nLeague franchises.\nThe league was to be made up of six teams in cities with PCL stadiums. Originally, a team was slated to play in Fresno, a non-PCL city. They moved their base of operations to San Diego, but did initially play at least one game in Fresno. Oakland far outpaced the rest of the league in the shortened season, with Seattle and San Francisco finishing above .500. San Diego, Portland and Los Angeles rounded out the standings."

        "text": "The Afghanistan men's national basketball team () is the men's national basketball team of Afghanistan and is controlled by the Afghanistan National Basketball Federation. Afghanistan joined FIBA and became a member of FIBA Asia in 1968. Afghanistan won the 2010 South Asian Games, becoming the first sports team to win gold in the nation's history.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nBasketball was first played in Afghanistan in 1936. In 1966, the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee (ANOC) founded the first national basketball team after receiving challenges from India and Pakistan. Tom Gouttierre, an American Peace Corps volunteer and coach of the team at Habibia High School, became the first coach. Using detailed, confidential instructions from John Wooden, the Afghanistan team became the only other to run the famous UCLA zone press.\nAlthough the international games were canceled, in 1969 Gouttierre returned on a Fulbright Fellowship and again became the Habibia coach, and in 1970 Bill Bradley of the New York Knicks tutored the team while visiting the country. That year China challenged the ANOC. Because of the lack of preparation time, Gouttierre decided that current and former Habibia players were the best choice for a second Afghanistan national team. Using the zone press, it defeated a much larger Chinese team in Parwan Province in the Afghanistan team's first international victory.\nFIBA Asia Cup.\nAfghanistan has failed to qualify for the FIBA Asia Cup, while as well as only entering in the qualification rounds only once in 2013 when they entered in the South Asian Basketball Association Qualifying Round. Afghanistan would defeat Nepal before losing to India and failing to qualify for the Asia Cup. This is their only appearance in FIBA Asia Cup qualification rounds to date.\nAsian Games.\nAfghanistan has made two brief appearance in the Asian Games in 2006 and 2010. Both times the men's national team would struggle for success and failing to qualify outside the first round in both years respectively. The 2010 edition would be marked as the last time Afghanistan has played any competitive men's national teams games.\nSouth Asian Games.\nAfghanistan would see their best success in international competition in the form of the 2010 edition of the South Asian Games. They would defeat India and claim gold in what has been their only appearance in the South Asian Games to date.\nCoaches.\nHead Coach:* Mamo Rafiq – 2007-now\nAssistant Coach: * Abdul Wasi Pazhman - 2010\nAssistant Coach: * Leo Balayon - 2009\n2010 team.\nThe following twelve players were named to the roster for the 2010 Asian Games."

        "text": "The Crash the Super Bowl contest was an annual online commercial competition run by Frito-Lay. Consumers were invited to create their own Doritos ads and each year, at least one fan-made commercial was guaranteed to air during the Super Bowl. In later editions of the contest, Doritos offered bonus prizes ranging from $400,000 to $1,000,000. Eight editions of the Crash the Super Bowl commercial contest were held between 2006 and 2016 and, during that time, fans submitted more than 36,000 entries.\n2006–2007 contest.\nIn the fall of 2006, Frito-Lay (with the help of their ad agency, Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, and led by their promotional agency, The Marketing Arm) launched the first installment of the Crash the Super Bowl contest. Consumers were tasked with creating 30 second commercials for Doritos products. In all, 1,065 consumer-made ads were submitted and displayed on the contest site, Crashthesuperbowl.com. From those entries, five ads were selected as finalists. The director of each selected ad received a cash prize of $10,000 and a trip for two to Detroit during Super Bowl XLI in February 2007. The five finalist ads were posted to the contest web site for a month-long public vote. The commercial that received the most votes, \"Live the Flavor\" aired during the 2007 Super Bowl. Though the five 2006–2007 finalists were flown to Detroit, they did not actually attend the Super Bowl. Instead, they watched the game from a private party near the stadium. In a move that has since become a Crash the Super Bowl tradition, no one, not even the finalists, knew which commercials would air before the game. \"Live the Flavor\" was the first consumer-generated ad to ever air during the Super Bowl and it was ranked the #4 best commercial of the game on the USA Today Ad Meter poll. Later in the game, Frito-Lay surprised the finalists by also airing a second Crash the Super Bowl ad, \"Check Out Girl.\"\nIn December 2007, Time.com named \"Live the Flavor\" the 9th best commercial of the year. Frito-Lay's PR company, Ketchum Inc., won a Golden World Award from the International Public Relations Association for their work on the 2006–2007 Crash the Super Bowl contest. According to the IPRA, the competition led to a 12% increase in sales of Doritos in January, 2007 and nearly one million people visited the Crash The Super Bowl website to view the submissions and vote for the finalists. In the months following the Super Bowl, Frito-Lay chose to air all five commercials that had made the Crash the Super Bowl finals.\n2007–2008 contest.\nIn the Fall of 2007, Frito-Lay announced that they would once again run the Crash the Super Bowl contest. But instead of being a commercial contest, the 2007–2008 installment would give an aspiring musician the chance to \"Crash\" the Super Bowl and have their music heard by millions of viewers. The winner would also receive a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records. The winner of the public vote was 22-year-old Kina Grannis and, during Super Bowl XLII, Frito-Lay purchased 60 seconds of commercial time to run a music video featuring Grannis performing part of her original song, \"Message From Your Heart.\" Frito-Lay also chose to air one of the 2006–2007 Crash the Super Bowl finalist ads, \"Mouse Trap\", during the game.\nGrannis' performance was seen by 100 million viewers and her song, \"Message From Your Heart\" briefly made the Top 30 on iTunes. However, Grannis' music video/commercial landed at the very bottom of USA Today's Super Bowl ad meter poll. The 2007 Crash the Super Bowl commercial that Doritos decided to air managed to rank #4 on the ad meter that year.\n2008–2009 contest.\nFrito-Lay brought the commercial contest back in the fall of 2008 and challenged filmmakers to create the best commercial of Super Bowl XLIII. If a consumer-made Doritos commercial could score the #1 spot on the official USA Today Ad meter poll, Frito-Lay would pay the ad's creator a one million dollar bonus. 1,961 entries were submitted in the fall of 2008 and five finalists spots were selected in early January. Each finalist received a prize of $25,000 and a trip for two to the Super Bowl. The finalists watched the game from a private box in the stadium. The ad that won the public vote was \"Free Doritos\" by Joe and Dave Herbert of Batesville, IN. \"Free Doritos\" did score the #1 spot on the 2009 Ad Meter poll and the Herbert brothers won the million dollar bonus. Frito-Lay also decided to air a bonus Crash the Super Bowl ad, \"The Power of the Crunch\", later in the game.\n2009–2010 contest.\nThe third installment of the Crash the Super Bowl commercial contest was launched in the fall of 2009. In this version of the contest, fans were encouraged to \"Take the Top 3\" spots on the USA Today Ad meter poll. Bonus prizes of $1,000,000, $600,000 and $400,000 were offered if a filmmakers scored the number one, two or three spot on the poll. If three Crash the Super Bowl commercials swept the top three spots on the ad meter, each team would receive an additional bonus of one million dollars.\nSix consumer-made ads were selected for the finals and each finalist received a prize of $25,000 plus a trip for two to the Super Bowl. Frito-Lay ultimately decided to air 4 of the 6 finalist commercials during Super Bowl XLIV. The Crash the Super Bowl spot, \"UnderDog\", was ranked the second best commercial on the USA Today ad Meter so the team that made that entry won a bonus of $600,000. Also of note in the 2009-2010 contest was the spot entitled \"Snack Attack Samurai\". Although ranking only 17th on the USA Today Ad Meter, it earned distinction as \"the most viewed ad of all time\" according to Nielsen ratings It held this record for one year until it was usurped by another Super Bowl ad.\n2010–2011 contest.\nOn September 15, 2010, Frito-Lay announced that Pepsi Max was joining Doritos for the 2010–2011 installment of the annual contest. Consumers could submit 30 second commercials for either product. Judges selected five Pepsi Max finalists and five Doritos finalists. Three commercials for each product then aired during the 2011 Super Bowl. The Doritos' commercial \"Pug Attack\" tied for first place on the USA Today Ad Meter poll and its creator received a one million dollar bonus from Frito-Lay. The Doritos Super Bowl ad \"House Sitting\" came in third on the Ad Meter poll and the creator of that spot won a bonus of $400,000.\n2011–2012 contest.\nFrito-Lay received more than 6,100 submissions for the 2012 Crash the Super Bowl contest Two fan-made commercials won million dollar bonuses, \"Man's Best Friend\" and \"Sling Baby.\" \"Man's Best Friend\" was ranked the number one ad of the game in the USA Today Ad Meter poll. Frito-Lay also offered a million dollar bonus to any Crash the Super Bowl ad that could win a second poll that was run by Facebook. Facebook voters ranked \"Sling Baby\" the best commercial of the game and the Sling Baby team won the bonus money.\n2012–2013 contest.\nOn September 18, 2012, Frito-Lay announced the 6th installment of the Crash the Super Bowl commercial contest. In addition to the regular prizes, the director of the commercial that scored the highest on the USA Today ad meter would win a job working with director Michael Bay on \"\".

For the first time ever, the entire Crash the Super Bowl contest was moved from Crashthesuperbowl.com and run on Facebook as a contest app. According to Frito-Lay, more than 3,500 entries were submitted in the fall of 2012. \"Fashionista Daddy\" and \"Goat 4 Sale\" both aired during the Super Bowl but neither ad was ranked the #1, #2, or #3 commercial of the game on the USA Today's public ad meter. \"Fashionista Daddy\" ranked the highest, so its director, Mark Freiburger, was the winner of the Transformers 4 job.\n2013–2014 contest.\nIn 2013, Frito-Lay announced that, for the first time, the Crash the Super Bowl contest would be accepting international entries. Anyone who lived in a country where Doritos are sold could participate. Instead of awarding bonus prizes, Frito-Lay promised to air the commercial that won an online vote and pay the creator a one million dollar grand prize.\nThe 2014 finalists were “Time Machine” by Ryan Andersen of Scottsdale, Arizona; “Office Thief” by Chris Capel of Valencia, California; “The Cowboy Kid” by Amber Gill of Ladera Ranch, California; “Breakroom Ostrich” by Eric Haviv of Atlanta, Georgia; and “Finger Cleaner” by Thomas Noakes of Sydney, Australia.\n\"Office Thief\" starred \"Deadwood\" actor Larry Cedar and Steve Olson.\nThe two fan-made ads that aired during the 2014 Super Bowl were \"The Cowboy Kid\" and \"Time Machine.\" The next day, Frito-Lay announced that \"Time Machine\" had received the most votes during the Pre-Super Bowl voting which meant that \"Time Machine\" was the contest's grand prize winner.\n2014–2015 contest.\nIn early September 2014, Frito-Lay announced the return of the Crash the Super Bowl contest.

        "text": " Anthony \"Paul Reno (born February 9, 1974) is an American college football coach. He is the head football coach at Yale University, a position he has held since 2012.\nEarly life and education.\nA native of Oxford, Massachusetts, Reno graduated from Oxford High School in 1992. Later that year, he enrolled at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York, but soon transferred to Worcester State College in his home state of Massachusetts. Reno played football at the free safety position for the Worcester State Lancers until 1996, under Brien Cullen. Reno graduated a year later in 1997. He would return to the school and complete a Master of Education in health education in 2000.\nCoaching career.\nUpon graduating from Worcester State, Reno began his coaching career as a defensive assistant, under Richard Mannello, for the King's College Monarchs in Pennsylvania. During that 1997 season, The Monarchs finished fourth in the MAC Freedom Conference with a losing 3–7 record.\nA year later, in 1998, Reno returned to the Worcester State Lancers as a defensive coordinator under his former coach, Cullen. Reno remained there until 2002. While his first two years at Worcester State saw losing records, the last three were very successful, and resulted in winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference Northeast Bowl in 2001.\nReno's success with the Lancers opened the opportunity as a wide receivers coach, under Jack Siedlecki, for the Yale Bulldogs in 2003. Reno was shuffled to be the defensive backs coach a year later, a post which he held until 2008. The Bulldogs mostly hovered around a .500 win percentage during his time at Yale; however, the 2006 season resulted in the team being named co-Ivy League champions, along with the Princeton Tigers.\nIn 2009, Reno transferred within the Ivy League to work for the Harvard Crimson as a special teams and defensive backs coach under Tim Murphy. The Crimson maintained a winning record throughout Reno's time there, and won the Ivy League in his final season in 2011.\nOn January 12, 2012, Reno was hired as the Joel E.

The association ranking based on the UEFA country coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nThe winners of the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League were given an additional entry as title holders if they would not qualify for the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League through their domestic league (because of the restriction that no association can have more than four teams playing in the Champions League, if the title holders are from the top three associations and finish outside the top four in their domestic league, the title holders' entry comes at the expense of the fourth-placed team of their association). However, this additional entry was not necessary for this season since the title holders qualified for the tournament through their domestic league.\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League, the associations are allocated places according to their 2013 UEFA country coefficients, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 2008–09 to 2012–13.\nDistribution.\nSince the title holders Real Madrid qualified for the Champions League group stage through their domestic league (as the third-placed team of the 2013–14 La Liga), the group stage spot reserved for the title holders is vacated, and the following changes to the default allocation system are made:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Title holders).\nNotes\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nThe final date of 6 June could cause problems for South American international players called up to play in the 2015 Copa América, which begins on 11 June. FIFA international rules require clubs to release players 14 days prior to the start of an international tournament, which means the players would have to miss the Champions League final if the rules were enforced. If the players were allowed to play in the Champions League final, that would leave them as few as five days to travel and train prior to playing in the Copa América.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2014 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties. Teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nFirst qualifying round.\nThe draw for the first and second qualifying rounds was held on 23 June 2014. The first legs were played on 1 and 2 July, and the second legs were played on 8 July 2014.\nSecond qualifying round.\nThe first legs were played on 15 and 16 July, and the second legs were played on 22 and 23 July 2014.\nThird qualifying round.\nThe third qualifying round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (Champions Route) and one for non-champions (League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round.\nThe draw for the third qualifying round was held on 18 July 2014. The first legs were played on 29 and 30 July, and the second legs were played on 5 and 6 August 2014.\nPlay-off round.\nThe play-off round was split into two separate sections: one for champions (Champions Route) and one for non-champions (League Route). The losing teams in both sections entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League group stage.\nThe draw for the play-off round was held on 8 August 2014. The first legs were played on 19 and 20 August, and the second legs were played on 26 and 27 August 2014.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was held in Monaco on 28 August 2014. The 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on their 2014 UEFA club coefficients, with the title holders being placed in Pot 1 automatically. They were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 16–17 September, 30 September–1 October, 21–22 October, 4–5 November, 25–26 November, and 9–10 December 2014.\nA total of 18 national associations were represented in the group stage. Ludogorets Razgrad and Malmö FF made their debut appearances in the group stage. For the first time since the 1995–96 season, England's Manchester United did not qualify for the group stage.\nTeams that qualified for the group stage also participated in the 2014–15 UEFA Youth League, a competition available to players aged 19 or under.\nThe group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League round of 32. See 2014–15 UEFA Champions League group stage for tiebreakers if two or more teams are equal on points.\nKnockout phase.\nIn the knockout phase, teams played against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nRound of 16.\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 15 December 2014. The first legs were played on 17, 18, 24 and 25 February, and the second legs were played on 10, 11, 17 and 18 March 2015.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was held on 20 March 2015. The first legs were played on 14 and 15 April, and the second legs were played on 21 and 22 April 2015.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals and final (to determine the \"home\" team for administrative purposes) was held on 24 April 2015. The first legs were played on 5 and 6 May, and the second legs were played on 12 and 13 May 2015.\nStatistics.\nStatistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round.\nSquad of the season.\nThe UEFA technical study group selected the following 18 players as the squad of the tournament:"

The tournament began with first-round play on May 12, and concluded with the championship game played at Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium of Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, on May 27, 2012. The Northwestern Wildcats were the 2012 NCAA Tournament champions.\nDates and locations.\nThe NCAA Tournament's eight first-round games were played Saturday, May 12, and Sunday, May 13, and the four quarterfinal games were played Saturday, May 19, and Sunday, May 20. The tournament's first-round and quarterfinal games were played on the home fields of the higher seeded teams. The winners of the four quarterfinal games advanced to the two semifinal games played on May 25 and hosted by Stony Brook University at LaValle Stadium, the home field of the Stony Brook Seawolves football and lacrosse teams. The tournament championship game was played at LaValle Stadium on May 27.\nTournament field.\nThe NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Committee selected sixteen teams to compete in the 2012 Division I women's lacrosse tournament. Eight teams were selected on an \"automatic qualifier\" basis. The tournament champions of five conferences, including the America East Conference, the American Lacrosse Conference (ALC), the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), the Big East Conference and the Ivy League, received automatic invitations to the NCAA Tournament. These five teams included the Albany Great Danes of the America East, the No. 1 seed Florida Gators of the ALC, the No. 3 seed Maryland Terrapins of the ACC, the No. 6 seed Loyola Greyhounds of the Big East, and the Dartmouth Big Green of the Ivy League.\nIn addition, three play-in games were held to determine the last three automatic qualifiers. The champions of the Patriot League, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), the Northeast Conference (NEC), the Atlantic 10 Conference, and the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) competed in the play-in games. The Patriot League's Navy Midshipmen defeated the Oregon Ducks of the Mountain Pacific, the CAA's Towson Tigers beat the NEC's Monmouth Hawks, and the Atlantic 10's UMass Minutemen defeated the Canisius Golden Griffins of the MAAC, with the winners receiving the final three automatic qualifier bids.\nThe remaining eight tournament teams were chosen by the NCAA tournament selection committee on an at-large basis; the factors considered by the selection committee included: (1) the NCAA's ratings percentage index (RPI); (2) results against common opponents; (3) significant wins and losses; and (4) evaluation of the ten highest-rated teams on a team's schedule, as defined by strength of schedule and winning percentage. The eight at-large teams selected by the committee were the No. 2 seed Northwestern Wildcats, No. 4 seed Syracuse Orange, No. 5 seed North Carolina Tar Heels, and No. 7 seed Duke Blue Devils, as well as the unseeded Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Penn Quakers, Penn State Nittany Lions, and Virginia Cavaliers.\nEight conferences placed member teams in the 2012 tournament, but four conferences dominated the selections, garnering twelve invitations in the sixteen-team field. The ACC received four bids (Maryland, North Carolina, Duke, and Virginia), the ALC got three (Florida, Northwestern, Penn State), the Big East also received three (Syracuse, Loyola, Notre Dame), and the Ivy League got two (Dartmouth, Penn). The ACC, ALC and Big East also dominated the tournament seeding, with member teams receiving the top seven seeds.\nTournament bracket.\nThe 2012 NCAA Tournament bracket consisted of sixteen teams, eight of whom were seeded No. 1 through No. 8. In the first round of the tournament, each of the eight seeded teams was paired with one of the eight unseeded teams."

The season began on 17 August 2013 and concluded on 18 May 2014; all top-flight European leagues ended earlier than the previous season due to the upcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup. Elche, Villarreal and Almería competed in La Liga this season after being promoted from the second tier.\nAtlético Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona traded the lead several times throughout the season. Entering the final weekend of play, Atlético Madrid were three points ahead of 2013 champions Barcelona. However, with the two teams facing off, Barcelona could claim the title with a win. The game ended in a draw, giving the \"Colchoneros\" their first league title in eighteen years, and their tenth overall. It was the first time since the 2003–04 season that a club other than Barcelona or Real Madrid, who finished second and third respectively, had won the title. Osasuna, Valladolid and Real Betis finished in the bottom three and were relegated.\nCristiano Ronaldo won the La Liga Award for Best Player for the first time. As the top scorer with 31 goals, Ronaldo also won the Pichichi Trophy, along with sharing the European Golden Shoe. Ángel Di María had the most assists, with 17. Thibaut Courtois won the Zamora Trophy for best goalkeeper.\nTeams.\nPromotion and relegation (pre-season).\nA total of twenty teams contested the league, including seventeen sides from the 2012–13 season and three promoted from the 2012–13 Segunda División. This included the top two ranked teams from the Segunda División, and the victorious team of the play-offs.\nMallorca, Deportivo La Coruña and Zaragoza were relegated to the 2013–14 Segunda División at the end of the previous season; Mallorca were relegated after sixteen years in La Liga, the longest period in the club's history, Zaragoza returned to the Segunda División after a four-year tenure in La Liga, and Deportivo made an immediate return to the second tier after being promoted the previous year. All three teams were relegated on the final matchday.\nThe three relegated teams were replaced by three 2012–13 Segunda División sides: Elche returned to the top level as Segunda División champions, after 24 years of absence and having spent the last fourteen consecutive seasons in the Segunda División. Second-placed Villarreal were also promoted to La Liga, making an immediate return to the top flight after a win over Almería in a decisive match near the end of the season which would see the winners directly promoted to La Liga. Almería themselves also eventually achieved promotion; the club returned to the Spanish top flight after spending two years in the Segunda by defeating Girona in the final of the promotion play-offs.\nThis was the first season since the 1988–89 campaign without any teams from the archipelagos of Spain (teams located on the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands) in the top flight, as Mallorca were relegated and Las Palmas failed to return to La Liga after losing in the semi-finals of the promotion play-offs.\nPersonnel and sponsorship.\nAs in the previous years, Nike provided the official ball for all matches, with a new Nike Incyte Liga BBVA model being used throughout the season for all matches.\nSeason summary.\nThe 2013–14 La Liga season was the 83rd since its establishment. Match days were drawn on 9 July 2013. The season began on 17 August 2013 and ended on 18 May 2014.\nFor the first time since 1951 and just the third time in league history, the La Liga title came down to a head-to-head match on the final weekend of play. Atlético Madrid were three points ahead of 2013 champion Barcelona, but had its final game on the road in Barcelona. Barcelona took a 1–0 lead into the half and Atlético lost two starters to injury in the half. A second half header, however, secured a 1–1 draw, earning the \"Colchoneros\" their first league title in 18 years, and their 10th overall. It was the first time since the 2003–04 La Liga that a club other than Barcelona or Real Madrid, which finished tied for second, won the title. It was also the first time in the 67-year history of the Camp Nou stadium that a visiting team had clinched the title in the stadium.\nThe emergence of Diego Costa and Koke was a large part of Atlético Madrid's success. Costa scored 36 goals on the season (27 in league play), including the winner in Atlético's first victory over Real Madrid since 1999. Koke had 18 assists on the year (13 in league play), to go with seven goals.\nEarlier in the season, Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barcelona ended a 31-match unbeaten streak for Real Madrid. The same day, Atlético beat Real Betis to claim the league lead. A loss against Levante and draw against Málaga left Atlético vulnerable heading into their final match.\nCristiano Ronaldo won the league scoring title with 31 goals. Messi was second and Costa third. Ángel Di María had most assists with 17. Thibaut Courtois won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for best goalkeeper.

        "title": "Grip (badminton)",
        "text": "In badminton, a grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. The most commonly used grip is the orthodox forehand grip. Most players change grips during a rally depending on whether it is a forehand or backhand shot. A grip is also the wrapping around the handle of the racket. There are many types and varieties of grips; the texture, thickness, color, material and surface (flat or waved) are all factors that make grips unique.\nForehand grip.\nIn order to understand the grips, it is important to know that the handle of a racquet always consists of 8 sides, or in other words, has an octagonal shape. A square shape would hurt the hand, while a round shape would not give enough friction to gain a firm grip. The eight sides of the handle are called bevels. The bevels can be numbered from 1 to 8; with the racquet surface perpendicular to the ground, the bevels are numbered from the top anti-clockwise. So bevel 1 would be the narrow bevel at the 'North' position, bevel 2 would be the diagonal bevel at the 'Northwest' position, etc.\nThe badminton handle should be held as if the player was lightly shaking hands with it. For right handed players, the right bottom side of the thumb should be touching the 3rd bevel while the left side of the index finger should be resting on the 7th level. The index finger rests on the 7th bevel above the adjacent location of the thumb on the 3rd level. The finger is shaped like a hook and holds onto the handle near the top section. The other fingers are wrapped around the lower sections of the handle.\nBackhand grip.\nThe backhand grip, also known as the thumb grip, is similar to the forehand grip except the complete bottom of the thumb is in contact with the 3rd bevel and the index finger is lowered down to a position below the thumb.\nBenefits and limitations of grip positions.\nHere is a table contrasting the benefits and limitations of using certain grips in certain situations.\nTypes of grips.\nUnderlying Grip (undergrip).\nThe underlying grip or the undergrip, is a layer of thin wrapping of synthetic leather that is wrapped around the bare handle of the racquet. All badminton racquets come with the undergrip and it is recommended that it is not removed. It is advised for players to apply an overgrip over the undergrip for normal use/play.\nWaved.\nThe waved badminton grip is a type of grip that has foam strips in the center of the grip wrap so that after the grip is applied, there will be 'grooves' on the grip that can help increase friction and comfort when holding the racquet. The only slight disadvantage of waved grips is that is slightly heavier than flat grips due to the excess foam for the grooves.\nFlat.\nThe Eastern Backhand grip is obtained when placing the hand such that the base knuckle of the index finger and heel of the hand are right on the 1st bevel. This is essentially the same as the Western forehand grip and allows for significant spin and control."

        "title": "Golf Ball",
        "text": "Golf Balls (sometimes Golfball) is a 1962 painting by Roy Lichtenstein. It is considered to fall within the art movement known as pop art. It depicts \"a single sphere with patterned, variously directional semi-circular grooves.\" The work is commonly associated with black-and-white Piet Mondrian works. It is one of the works that was presented at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and one that was critical to his early association with pop art. The work is commonly critiqued for its tension involving a three-dimensional representation in two dimensions with much discussion revolving around the choice of a background nearly without any perspective.\nHistory.\nWhen Lichtenstein had his first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. \"Golf Ball\" was one of the works that thing exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein included \"Golf Ball\" in \"Still Life with Goldfish Bowl\", 1972, and \"Go for Baroque\", 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.\nThe use of black and white is regarded as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 \"Composition in Black and White\". Alternatively, it may have been a reference to another of Mondrian's pre-World War I black and white oval paintings, such as \"Pier and Ocean\", 1915. This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian \"Plus and Minus\" paintings.\nDescription.\nIn 1962, Lichtenstein produced several works in which he depicted \"the repetitive regularity of their patterned surfaces.\" \"Golf Ball\" is a depiction of a golf ball using a Mondrianesque set of black and white arcs to depict the three-dimensionality of the subject. However, the neutral background manipulates the image and diminishes the volumetric characteristics by stripping the viewer of his perspective. It is described as a \"pure graphic mark on a gray ground\" as well as a \"totality of abstract marks.\" Lichtenstein described \"Golf Ball\" as \"the antithesis of what was thought of as having 'art meaning because of its lack of perspective.\n\"Golf Ball\" is an example of the emerging \"confident authority\" of his single-image paintings with its \"Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness\". The \"frontal and centralized presentations directness lacked the sophistication to market the images of household goods for advertising but was considered daring artistically. The black and white painting on a grey background challenges both the natural perception of realism and the boundaries of abstraction. The work \"gives us both the impression of space and the fact of surface\".\n\"Golf Ball\" was one of the bases by which \"critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art\", although much is made about the painting's references to abstract painting, especially its likeness to Mondrian's works. Furthermore, the painting leverages tensions regarding three-dimensional representation in two dimensions resulting from spatial ambiguities caused by the lack of cues in the background.\nReception.\nDiane Waldman refers to the subject of \"Golf Ball\" as a freestanding form. This is one of the figures in which Lichtenstein demonstrates his draftsman experience. This work demonstrated his maturation as an artist with standardized contours that present uniformity and solidified inflections. This is a strong example of presenting the tension of volumetric potential balanced against two-dimensional presentation. It also shows how placement against a neutral background diminishes three-dimensionality. Despite Lichtenstein's techniques to display/minimize dimensionality, the viewer imposes his or her own visualization experiences on the painting, which minimizes the effect of spatial illusion."

        "title": "2012 United States men's Olympic basketball team",
        "text": "The men's national basketball team of the United States won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Defending the gold medal won by the 2008 team in the previous Olympic Games, the Americans qualified for the 2012 Games after winning the 2010 FIBA World Championship. The Olympic team lost some players to injuries who might have made the team, and appeared to be short on big men. Their roster featured five players returning from the 2008 Olympic team and five others from the 2010 World Championship.\nThe US went undefeated but appeared vulnerable in five exhibition games. They finished the tournament with a perfect 8–0 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 points while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a small lineup that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting. The team set an Olympic single-game record with 156 points scored against Nigeria in the preliminary round. In a rematch of the 2008 finals, Team USA again defeated Spain to capture the gold.\nRoster.\nThe 2012 team consisted of returning 2008 Olympic gold medal winners small forwards LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, point guards Chris Paul and Deron Williams, and shooting guard Kobe Bryant. It also featured 2010 World Championship winners small forwards Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, power forward Kevin Love, center Tyson Chandler, and point guard Russell Westbrook. Players earning All-NBA honors in the 2011–12 NBA season included Bryant, Durant, James and Paul on the first team; second-teamers Love and Westbrook; and Anthony and Chandler from the third team.\nThe final two Olympics roster spots were claimed by shooting guard James Harden and power forward Blake Griffin; they were chosen over shooting guard Eric Gordon, small forward Rudy Gay, and power forward Anthony Davis. Griffin then sustained a torn meniscus during practice and was replaced by Davis, the first overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft, who earlier was unable to practice during the final tryouts due to an ankle injury. Forward Lamar Odom removed himself from consideration in July before the start of training camp.\nThe initial 20 finalists were announced in January 2012. In addition to Griffin, others withdrew due to injury including power forwards Chris Bosh (abdomen) and LaMarcus Aldridge (torn meniscus), point guards Derrick Rose (ACL) and Chauncey Billups, shooting guard Dwyane Wade (knee), and center Dwight Howard (back surgery). Harden and Davis were added as replacements. Center Andrew Bynum declined an invitation to be added as a finalist.\nThe final team was built on quickness and speed. While the roster appeared to be weakened by the injuries to its inside players, Team USA executive director Jerry Colangelo believed the team was deeper, more athletic and more experienced than the 2008 gold-medal team.\nExhibition games.\nThe United States went undefeated at 5–0 in their exhibition games, but were behind early against Brazil and Spain and played a close game against Argentina.\nOlympic play.\nThe Americans went an undefeated 8–0 and averaged 116 points per game, winning by an average margin of 32.1 points—the fifth highest in US Olympic history. Team USA trailed in the fourth quarter only once, against Lithuania in the opening round. James became the leader of the team with Bryant—who would turn 34 in August 2012—stepping back. James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. After winning the gold, Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski said James \"is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now\". Durant scored a United States Olympics record of 156 points in the tournament. He also made 34 three-point field goals, doubling the previous United States mark of 17; Anthony (23) also surpassed the former record. Bryant was not in peak condition early, but he played himself into shape and was a key contributor in the final three games. While Chandler was the team's only true center—Davis was thin and had no professional experience—Krzyzewski also played Love, James or Anthony as Team USA's de facto center. Love led the team with 61 rebounds (27 offensive).\nCompensating for its lack of big men, the US played small ball and spread its playmakers around the three-point line and with a player penetrating and passing the ball back outside. They won with \"basically five players on the perimeter,\" Spain coach Sergio Scariolo said. Bryant and Krzyzewski declared at the completion of the tournament that 2012 was their final Olympic appearance. They both joined Team USA after the disappointing bronze finish in the 2004 Games. Krzyzewski left with a 62–1 record and a 50-game winning streak in international play for the Americans. He joined Henry Iba as the only US coaches to lead the team to consecutive Olympic gold medals. In 2013, Team USA announced Krzyzewski would return as head coach from 2013 through 2016.\nPreliminary round.\nThe US competed in Group A in the opening round. Teams played in a round-robin format with the top four teams advancing to the next round. The Americans ended group play 5–0, the only undefeated team and the group's top seed.\nFrance.\nDurant scored 22 points, and James had eight assists while taking only six shots as the US won their opening game 98–71 over France. The US was never in any real trouble, but played sloppy in the beginning, missing their first six three-point attempts and being called for 18 personal fouls in the first half. Anthony and Westbrook spent the final six minutes of the half on the bench after their third personal fouls. The team led 52–36 at halftime, which expanded to 78–51 after three quarters. Krzyzewski was able to rest Bryant, James, and Durant for most of the final period, and even the 19-year-old Davis played.\nDurant, Anthony, and Chandler contributed nine rebounds each, and Love finished with 14 points. Bryant, James and Durant finished the game a combined 6 for 12 on three-pointers, while the rest of the team shot 2 for 13. France's team featured six NBA players, including Tony Parker.\nTunisia.\nThe US won in a 110–63 blowout over Tunisia, but only after Krzyzewski benched his starters—Bryant, James, Durant, Paul, and Chandler—to begin the second half. The reserves—Love, Anthony, Iguodala, Williams and Westbrook—responded with a 21–3 run to open the half, turning a 46–33 halftime lead to a 67–36 advantage. Tunisia, the consensus weakest team in the Olympics and listed by one website as 54-point underdogs, led the game 15–12 after nine minutes, and trailed only 35–30 with about minutes remaining in the first half. The Americans then scored 11 consecutive points.\nLike the opening game when they missed their first six three-pointers, the US started this game an even worse 0-for-8. Colangelo said opponents' strategy was to force the Americans to shoot from outside and hope for an off night. The US made 17 of 22 on conventional field goals in the first half, while missing 10 of 12 from three-point range. This was the team's second consecutive slow start in the Olympics, following the pattern in their five earlier exhibition games. The Americans scored on a variety of dunks once the game was in hand. Anthony and Love led the team with 16 points. Six Americans scored in double figures, including Durant who had 13 points and added 10 rebounds and 5 assists.\nNigeria.\nThe US answered critics of their slow starts and outside shooting with a 156–73 blowout of Nigeria. The Americans scored an Olympic-record 78 points in the first half en route to breaking the record for points in a game of 138, set by Brazil against Egypt in 1988. The record was broken with 4:37 left to play, and the team set US records for 3-pointers (29), field goals (59), field goal percentage (71%), and margin of victory (83).\nAnthony scored 37 points in only 14 minutes of play, shooting 10 of 12 on three-pointers and breaking the US single-game scoring record in less than three quarters. He broke Stephon Marbury's record of 31 against Spain in 2004. Bryant scored 16 points, 14 in the first quarter, as the US scored 49 points in the opening period. They led 78–45 at halftime before doubling their scoring total in the second half. The Americans shot 29 of 46 on three-point attempts (63 percent). They more than doubled their previous record of 13 made, which was broken by halftime after 11 three-pointers in the first quarter alone. Krzyzewski defended the blowout, noting that he removed his stars in the second half, ordered a zone defense, and stopped allowing fast breaks in the opening period.\nLithuania.\nMainly a facilitator in the first three games, James scored 9 of his 20 points in the final four minutes as the US came back to defeat Lithuania 99–94. Linas Kleiza scored 25 to lead Lithuania, which led by 84–82 with 5:50 remaining. The US took a three-point lead, but Lithuania pulled within 87–86 with 4:12 in the game. James followed with a three-pointer and a dunk. Entering the contest, James was averaging just 6.7 points but with 5.7 assists.\nAnthony added 20 points, and Paul contributed seven rebounds, six assists and four of the Americans' 17 steals. The US made only 10 of 33 attempts on three-point attempts and too often settled for outside shots. Lithuania outrebounded the US 42–37 and shot an impressive 58 percent from the field. The Americans struggled to defend Lithuania's high pick-and-roll. However, the US team's deep bench wore Lithuania down in the final period, forcing several turnovers to determine the outcome in the final minutes. Winning their first three games by an average of 52.2 points and playing so well, the team had canceled their previous two practices and rested while watching other sports instead.\nArgentina.\nDurant scored 17 of his 28 points in the third quarter as the US turned a one-point game into a 126–97 blowout over Argentina. The US led just 60–59 at halftime, when Durant matched Argentina's point total during a 42-point third quarter explosion by the Americans. James scored the first seven in the quarter before Durant took over and shot 5 of 6 from three-point range. He finished 8 of 10 from three-point range, and the team was 20 of 39. James had 18 points in the game, and Paul added 17.\nThe US allowed Argentina to make 11 of its first 15 shots, and the Americans lead was never bigger than six in the second quarter. Argentina's Luis Scola did not play in the second period, and starting point guard Pablo Prigioni sat the entire game. They rested their starters in the fourth quarter in preparation for their quarterfinal meeting against Brazil, and a possible rematch against the Americans in the semifinals. Manu Ginóbili led the Argentines with 16 points, all in the first half. The US finished the first round as the top seed in their group and the only team undefeated in group play. An American loss by at least 13 points would have placed Argentina instead into the top spot from Group A.\nKnockout round.\nThe single-elimination round features the top four teams from each of the two groups from the opening round.\nQuarterfinal – Australia.\nBryant made six straight three-pointers in the second half and James finished with the first triple-double in US Olympic history. The Americans surrendered 11 consecutive points to start the second half. The US was leading by six when Bryant, who shot 0 for 3 in the first half, made consecutive threes to give his team a 70–58 lead. He scored all of his 20 points in the second half, including four consecutive three-pointers in a 66-second span. He entered the game averaging only 9.4 points.\nJames finished with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists, and he almost had a triple-double by halftime (seven points, 10 rebounds, and six assists). Love added 10 points and 11 rebounds (eight offensive), Anthony scored 17, and Durant had 14.\nSemifinal – Argentina.\nThe US met Argentina for the third time in a span of 17 days in the third straight Olympic semifinal meeting between the two countries. Argentina in 2004 was the last team to beat the Americans in Olympic play.\nDurant scored 19 points, while James and Anthony added 18 each as the US pulled away from Argentina in the second half for a 109–83 win. Ginóbili hit a three-pointer at the buzzer at the end of the first half to bring Argentina within 47–40, and he scored another three to open the second half to cut the lead to four points. Durant and James took over the game as the Americans led by 17 points to start the fourth.\nBryant scored 13 points in the first half—including 11 in the first quarter—and Durant made four three-pointers in the third, while Anthony made four of his own in the fourth. The US made 18 three-pointers in the game. James finished the game with seven rebounds and seven assists.\nFinal – Spain.\nThe US met Spain in the gold medal game, a rematch of the finals in the 2008 Olympics. The Americans had won 118–107 in Beijing that year after leading by just four with about minutes left. Spain in 2012 was ranked second in the world behind the US, and had a size advantage with brothers Pau and Marc Gasol. The Spaniards lost games to Russia and Brazil in group play and trailed the Russians by 13 points early in their semifinal win. The US had also beaten Spain for Olympic gold in 1984. The Americans were 8–1 against Spain since the introduction of the NBA players into FIBA events in 1992.\nThe Olympics' own daily preview of the 2012 rematch said it would \"likely take a great game from Spain and an off-day from the US to cause an upset\". The Americans had been tested only once against Lithuania, and they had dominated opponents in points off turnovers (198–77) and fast-break points (175–55). In a game that was close until the final minutes, the US defeated Spain 107–100. The Americans led the Spanish by only one point after three quarters, but James scored on a dunk and then a three-point basket for a 102–93 lead with 1:59 to play. James had 19 points in the game, joining Michael Jordan as the only players to win the NBA regular-season Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold in the same year. Durant added 30 points, the first 30-point game in an Olympic final in US history. Spain was led by Pau Gasol with 24 points, including his team's first 13 points in the second half to give them a 71–70 lead halfway into the third quarter. Gasol added eight rebounds and seven assists in the game.\nSpain also trailed by one after the first half, which included their guard Juan Carlos Navarro scoring 19 of his 21 points. The Spanish kept the game close despite Marc Gasol being called for four fouls in the first quarter and a half. James, who frequently guarded one of the Gasols due to the Americans' lack of big men, went to the bench with 7:23 in the game after his fourth foul before returning for the final five minutes. Bryant had 17 in the game for Team USA, and Love contributed nine points and nine rebounds. The final margin of seven points was the second-closest Olympic final ever after the Soviet Union's controversial one-point defeat of the United States in 1972.\nDream Team comparisons.\nBryant and James believed the 2012 team would win against the Dream Team, the 1992 Olympic team considered by some the greatest sports team ever assembled. Bryant said, \"[T]hey were a lot older, at kind of the end of their careers. We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete\". Dream Team member Charles Barkley said that he \"just started laughing\" upon hearing Bryant's comment and thought the 1992 team would win by double digits. Michael Jordan added: \"For [Bryant] to compare those two teams is not one of the smarter things he ever could have done... Remember now, they learned from us. We didn't learn from them\". Bird joked, \"They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now.\" Bryant later clarified that he thought the 1992 team was better, but it was \"ludicrous\" to think his team could not beat the Dream Team in one game. \"You didn't ask me if we could beat them in a 7-game series\", he said.\nMost experts believed the 1992 team would prevail with a distinct advantage with their centers, David Robinson and Patrick Ewing, over the smaller 2012 team. Chandler was the only player on the 2012 team, but his offensive game was limited. Some felt the discussion might have been more compelling if Dwight Howard and other injured big men were on the 2012 squad. NBA coach Doc Rivers felt the London team had an advantage with their outside shooting over the Dream Team. Like Barkley, CBSSports.com opined that only three members of the 2012 team—Bryant, James, and Durant—would have made the Dream Team.\nThe Dream Team averaged 117.3 points and won its games by an average of 43.8 points. The 2012 team averaged a similar point total (115.5) but won by a lesser margin (32.1). The Dream Team beat Croatia by 32 in the gold-medal game, while the 2012 team won by just seven. However, the level of international competition improved since 1992. The 2012 team faced a tougher opponent in Spain, which had seven NBA players; Croatia in 1992 had only two NBA players at that point. Overall, the 2012 Olympic field had 39 NBA players and 18 former NBA players were on team rosters, while rosters in 1992 had 17 NBA players and three other former players—more than half of those NBA players were on the Dream Team."

        "text": "The 97th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 26, 2013. It was the premier event of the 2013 IZOD IndyCar Series season. Tony Kanaan, a native of Brazil, was victorious on a record-setting day. Kanaan became the fourth Brazilian driver to win the Indianapolis 500 joined by Emerson Fittipaldi, Helio Castroneves, and Gil de Ferran.\nThe track opened for practice on Saturday, May 11. Time trials were held May 18–19, and the final practice, traditionally dubbed \"Carb Day\", was Friday, May 24. A support race, the Freedom 100 for the Indy Lights series was also held on Carb Day. In time trials, owner/driver Ed Carpenter of Indianapolis won the pole position, the first American-born pole-sitter since 2006, and the first owner/driver to sit on the pole since 1975.\nFor the first time since 1987, two drivers in the field entered the race attempting to win a fourth Indianapolis 500. Three-time winners Hélio Castroneves (2001, 2002, 2009) and Dario Franchitti (2007, 2010, 2012) attempted to tie A. J. Foyt, Al Unser Sr. and Rick Mears for the most Indy 500 victories. Neither driver was victorious this day, through Castroneves would achieve the feat in 2021. Unknown at the time, the 2013 race would be Franchitti's last; he retired after suffering severe injuries in a crash at Houston about five months later.\nAfter eleven previous attempts, Tony Kanaan, racing for KV Racing Technology, won the race. On a restart with three laps remaining, Kanaan overtook leader Ryan Hunter-Reay in the first turn. Three-time champion Dario Franchitti got loose and crashed into the outside wall bringing out the final caution of the race. Kanaan led Rookie of the Year Carlos Muñoz and Hunter-Reay across the line. The average speed of the race – – was the fastest Indianapolis 500, breaking the record set in 1990 by Arie Luyendyk. The record would stand until 2021. The 68 lead changes, and 14 different leaders, set during the race are also new records. Other records set (each of which have since been broken) included most cars running at the finish in a race that completed 200 laps (26), fewest caution laps (21), most laps completed by the field (5,863), as well as a 133-lap caution-free segment from lap 61 through 193.\nChevrolet swept the top four finishing positions, and took its first Indianapolis 500 win since 2002, breaking Honda's streak of nine consecutive Indy 500 wins. Chassis manufacturer Dallara won its 8th straight Indy 500, and 13th overall since joining the series in 1997.\nSchedule.\nROP — denotes rookie orientation program\nComm. — denotes 500 Festival Community Day\nEntry list.\nThe official entry list was released May 7, featuring 34 entries. The initial entry list included four rookies (A. J. Allmendinger, Conor Daly, Tristan Vautier, Carlos Muñoz) and four former winners in Hélio Castroneves, Dario Franchitti, Scott Dixon and Buddy Lazier.\nRyan Briscoe—who took pole position for the 2012 race—was unable to secure a full-time drive for the 2013 season, but participated in the race in a fourth car entered by Chip Ganassi Racing.\nPractice and rookie orientation.\nRookie orientation was scheduled for Thursday, April 11. However, due to a poor weather forecast, was postponed. Instead, rookies will participate in special two-hour sessions during the first two days of Indianapolis 500 practice.\nTesting – Thursday, May 9.\nA private test focused on NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, who tested a car for Andretti Autosport. Busch conducted the evaluation test with the possibility of attempting \"Double Duty\" in 2014. Busch reached a top lap of 218 mph.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace summary.\nStart.\nFor the first time since 1987, multiple three-time winners of the race were in contention (Franchitti and Castroneves); however, neither driver ended up being a serious threat to win the race. The race started at 12:15 p.m. EDT (4:15 p.m. UTC). Ed Carpenter started in pole position, but Marco Andretti, who started in third position, soon took the lead. The initial start and first laps commenced without any crashes or yellow flags.\nFirst half.\nThe first caution flag flew when J. R. Hildebrand hit the wall in Turn 2 on the fourth lap of the race, just after posting the fastest time for a lap in the race. Hildebrand had almost won the 2011 Indianapolis 500 but lost due to a crash during the final lap, and then in the 2013 was out of contention after the early crash. On lap 36, driver Sebastián Saavedra was bumped between turns three and four and subsequently crashed into the wall outside of turn four. Driver Pippa Mann later apologized for the accident on her website. The first half of the race featured many lead changes, with Tony Kanaan, Carpenter, and Andretti exchanging the leading spot; however, just before the halfway point in the race, A. J. Allmendinger passed Kanaan to take the lead, with Ryan Hunter-Reay and Andretti following behind in third and fourth, respectively.\nSecond half.\nAllmendinger, leading with under 90 laps to go, had a clasp from his seatbelt come loose and was forced to make a pitstop so his pit crew could refasten it, losing the lead. Driver Graham Rahal then crashed with 7 laps left to go, bringing the race under a yellow caution flag. Ryan Hunter-Reay had been in the lead during this caution flag, but when the caution ended, Kanaan, who ran in the top ten most of the race, slipped by Hunter-Reay to take the lead. Just when Kanaan led in the first turn, Dario Franchitti crashed with three laps left, causing another yellow caution flag that would last for the remainder of the race. Under the yellow flag, Kanaan finished the final 2.5 laps to win his first Indy 500, with Carlos Muñoz in second place and Hunter-Reay in third. The race featured more lead changes than any previous Indianapolis 500 with 68, twice the number of the previous record (34), set in 2012. Kanaan said after the race, \"I was looking at the stands, and it was unbelievable ... This is it, man. I made it. Finally they're going to put my ugly face on this trophy\".\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nRecord and milestones.\nNumerous race records and statistical milestones were set during the race:\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was broadcast live in high definition in the United States on ABC.

        "text": "James Duffy Henderson (born October 21, 1982) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher who is the assistant pitching coach for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Mets.\nEarly life.\nHenderson was born in Calgary, Alberta, to Marilyn and Neil Henderson, an auto mechanic at the University of Calgary. Henderson's father died as a result of Lou Gehrig's disease when Henderson was a teenager.\nAs a high school student, Henderson played summer baseball for the Okotoks Dawgs in Okotoks. He graduated from Bishop Carroll High School before playing two seasons at Midland College, a junior college in Texas, then moving on to Tennessee Wesleyan College and the Bulldogs of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics.\nPlaying career.\nMontreal Expos/Washington Nationals (2003–2006).\nHenderson was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 26th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft. He made his professional debut that summer pitching out of the bullpen for the Rookie League Gulf Coast League Expos and Class A Short Season Vermont Expos in the New York–Penn League. He played the entire 2004 season with Vermont and was promoted to the Class A Savannah Sand Gnats of the South Atlantic League in 2005. After opening the 2006 season with the Class A-Advanced Carolina League's Potomac Nationals, Henderson was sent back to Savannah for three games before returning to Potomac for the rest of the campaign. \nChicago Cubs (2007–2008).\nThe Chicago Cubs selected Henderson in the 2006 Rule 5 draft. He played the majority of 2007 with the Double-A Tennessee Smokies in the Southern League except for eight games in the middle of the season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs in the Pacific Coast League. He began the 2008 season at Tennessee but was promoted to Iowa after five games. He pitched three games at Triple-A Iowa before a shoulder injury ended his season and resulted in his release from the Cubs organization in March 2009.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2009–2015).\nHenderson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers before the start of the 2009 season. He played the majority of that year with the Class A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League but was promoted to the Florida State League's Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees midseason and the Double-A Southern League's Huntsville Stars in August. Over 26 appearances for Wisconsin, Henderson held 1.07 earned run average (ERA) with 26 strikeouts in  innings, which earned him a spot in the 2009 Midwest League All-Star Game. He played the entire 2010 season with Huntsville after which he became a free agent. After re-signing with the Brewers, he split the 2011 campaign between Huntsville and the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in the Pacific Coast League.\nAfter ten years in the minors, Henderson earned his first promotion to MLB when the Milwaukee Brewers summoned him from Nashville on July 26, 2012, making his major league debut that night against the Washington Nationals, pitching one inning and striking out the first batter he faced, Roger Bernadina. At Nashville, he was selected for the Triple-A All-Star Game with a 1.69 ERA, 56 strikeouts, 4 wins, and 15 saves as the Sounds' closer.\nIn 2013, Henderson replaced struggling fellow Canadian-born John Axford as the Brewers' closer. Henderson went 5–5 with a 2.70 ERA while collecting 28 saves in 32 opportunities. His fastball had high velocity, reaching up to , and he established his slider as a strikeout pitch, which established him as a strikeout pitcher, finishing the season with an 11.3 K/9. Francisco Rodríguez closed while Henderson was on the disabled list (DL) with a hamstring strain, but Henderson regained the role after Rodriguez was traded to the Baltimore Orioles.\nHenderson won the Brewers closer job for 2014 out of spring training despite experiencing a loss in velocity. This was later revealed to be caused by right shoulder inflammation, and he went on the 15-day DL in April after compiling a 7.15 ERA in 14 games pitched. Henderson was later transferred to the 60-day DL following a minor league rehab assignment, and he ended up missing the rest of the season after having shoulder surgery in August.\nStill seeking to reclaim his lost velocity after his 2014 shoulder surgery, Henderson was outrighted to the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox on May 21, 2015. He spent over a month on the DL at Colorado Springs and elected to become a free agent after the season.\nNew York Mets (2016).\nHenderson signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets for 2015 that included an invitation to spring training. He made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2016 after a spring training in which he posted a 1.69 ERA with 13 strikeouts over  innings beating out Sean Gilmartin for the last spot in the Mets' bullpen. On June 21, he was placed on the DL with tendinitis in his right biceps. After 14 minor league rehab appearances, mostly with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, he was activated from the DL and added to the active roster on August 20. He was outrighted to Triple-A after the season and elected free agency.\nChicago Cubs (2017).\nHenderson signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs for 2017 with an invitation to spring training, but he was released before the season's start.\nMilwaukee Brewers (2018).\nIn 2018, Henderson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. He was assigned to the Double-A Biloxi Shuckers in the Southern League and placed on the 60-Day DL. He was released after the season without having appeared in any games.\nCoaching career.\nDuring the 2018 season, while he was on the Biloxi 60-Day DL, Henderson assisted in Milwaukee's scouting department and served as the bullpen coach for Milwaukee's Class A Short Season Helena Brewers in the Pioneer League. In 2019, he was the pitching coach with the Class A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers. Before the cancellation of the 2020 minor league season, he was slated to be the pitching coach for the Brewers' Triple-A San Antonio Missions. Henderson began serving as pitching coach for the Brewers' new Triple-A affiliate, the Nashville Sounds, in 2021.\nHenderson was promoted to Milwaukee to serve as their bullpen coach beginning with the 2022 season.\nInternational competition.\nHenderson was a member of the gold medal winning Canadian national baseball team at the 2011 Pan American Games. In recognition of the victory, the team was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012."

The youngest athlete in the delegation was freestyle skier Sandra Näslund, at 17 years old, while ice hockey player Daniel Alfredsson was the oldest athlete at 41. Alfredsson competed in his fifth Olympics, and he thus became the first Swedish ice hockey player that has participated in five Olympic tournaments. 55 athletes were Olympic debutants. Sweden won 15 medals in total, making the Sochi games Sweden's most successful Winter Games ever in terms of medals. However, the number of gold medals (2) was lower than in the two previous Winter Games.\nSummary.\nOn 8 February, the first competition day, cross-country skier Charlotte Kalla won the first Swedish medal at the Games.

In ice hockey, Sweden's women's team qualified for the semi-finals after defeating Finland with 4–2 in the quarterfinal.\nThe second gold medal came on 16 February, as Marcus Hellner completed a strong team effort in the men's relay, crossing the finish line almost half a minute ahead of silver medalists Russia.

In ice hockey, the Swedish team won their quarterfinal against Slovenia with 5–0 and qualified for the semifinals.\nThe first Swedish medal outside the cross-country skiing events was earned on 20 February, after the Swedish women's curling team lost their final game against Canada with the score 3–6.

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level during their cricketing careers. Brett Lee has the fifth-highest number of international five-wicket hauls among Australian cricketers as of 2013. A right-arm fast bowler, he is regarded as one of the fastest international bowlers in the modern cricketing era.\nLee picked up a five-wicket haul on Test debut, playing against India in December 1999; a match that Australia won. His career-best figures for an innings were 5 wickets for 30 runs against West Indies at the Brisbane Cricket Ground in November 2005; while never managing to take ten wickets in a single match. Eight of his ten Test five-wicket hauls were taken at home. After capturing 310 wickets, Lee retired from Test cricket in 2010 and remains Australia's fourth-most successful bowler in the format.\nAfter making his One Day International (ODI) debut against Pakistan in January 2000, Lee's first ODI five-wicket haul came in one of the matches of the series against India; the performance ensured Australia's victory. With nine five-wicket hauls, his position is third in the all-time ODI list. His career-best bowling in ODI cricket was 5 wickets for 22 runs against South Africa at Melbourne Cricket Ground in January 2006; his performance earned him the man of the match award. Lee claimed 19 five-wicket hauls in his International career, and Australia never lost any of the games on such instances. However, he never took more than five wickets in a single innings in any format of the international game. Lee played his first Twenty20 International (T20I) against New Zealand in 2005, and is Australia's fourth-highest wicket-taker in the format. He never took a five-wicket haul in T20I, where his best bowling figures remain 3 wickets for 23 runs. Lee announced his retirement from international cricket in July 2012."

        "text": "The men's artistic gymnastics individual all-around competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics was held at the North Greenwich Arena on 28 July and 1 August 2012. It included 41 competitors from 27 nations.\nKōhei Uchimura of Japan won the gold medal, his nation's first victory in the men's all-around since 1984 and its fifth overall. (At that point, Japan was second to the Soviet Union, whose gymnasts won the event six times; Uchimura would win again in 2016, bringing the two nations even.) Uchimura was the 14th man to earn multiple all-around medals, adding to his silver from 2008.\nGermany's Marcel Nguyen earned silver, the first men's all-around medal for a German gymnast (including the United Team of Germany, East Germany, and West Germany) since the 1936 Games in Berlin. Danell Leyva of the United States took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the men's individual all-around in the Olympics. The event was first held in 1900 and has been included in every Games since then.\nTwo of the top 10 gymnasts from the 2008 Games returned in 2012: Uchimura and seventh-place finisher Fabian Hambüchen of Germany. Uchimura had won the past three World Championships and was the favorite coming into the Games.\nAzerbaijan made its debut in the event. France made its 24th appearance, the most of any nation.\nQualification process.\nQualification for the 2012 Olympics was based primarily on the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The top 8 teams at the world championships could send a full team of 5 gymnasts to the Olympics. The teams ranked 9th through 16th competed in the 2012 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event, where the top 4 finishers also qualified full teams for the Olympics.\nThe individual apparatus medalists from the World Championships also qualified, if their nation had not already qualified a team. The FIG Executive Board made invitational selections to ensure host country and continental representation, and the Tripartite Commission made an invitation.

The final was held on 31 August 1978.\nThe two favourites for the race were Steve Ovett and Sebastian Coe Ovett had won silver at 800 m at the previous European Championships in 1974 in Rome, and had won the 1500m, in spectacular fashion, at the IAAF World Cup the previous year (he was to remain unbeaten at that distance until the 1980 Olympics). Coe was the new British record holder at 800 m and the fastest man that year leading into the race at 800 m.\nThe race was billed in the press, the British press in particular, as a 'Coe versus Ovett' contest - a race that was the start of a rivalry that was to dominate not only British and European but World middle-distance running over the next few years. However, by concentrating on Coe and Ovett the press were ignoring the other talents in the race, including East Germany's Olaf Beyer.\nIn the race itself, Coe led from the front setting a blistering first lap pace, going through the bell in a suicidal 49.32 s. At 700 m, he was spent and Ovett kicked past him for home. However, the fast-finishing Beyer first caught Coe and then Ovett to strike gold, in doing so recording the fastest time that year.\nResults.\nFinal.\n31 August\nSemi-finals.\n30 August\nHeats.\n29 August\nParticipation.\nAccording to an unofficial count, 24 athletes from 15 countries participated in the event."

        "text": "The men's épée competition in fencing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London was held on 1 August at the ExCeL London Exhibition Centre. There were 30 competitors from 24 nations. Rubén Limardo of Venezuela won the gold medal – the country's only medal of the 2012 Games as well as the country's first medal in men's individual épée. Norway's Bartosz Piasecki won silver (that nation's first medal in the event, as well) and Jung Jin-Sun from South Korea took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nThree of the eight quarterfinalists from 2008 returned: fifth-place finisher Jung Jin-Sun of South Korea, sixth-place finisher Radosław Zawrotniak of Poland, and eighth-place finisher Bas Verwijlen of the Netherlands. Paolo Pizzo of Italy was the reigning (2011) World Champion, with 2010 champion Nikolai Novosjolov of Estonia also competing in London.\nSenegal and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the event. France and the United States each appeared for the 24th time, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. The men's rotation started with foil (2008) and épée (2012), with sabre scheduled to skip its team event in 2016. Thus, the maximum for individual épée in 2012 was two per nation.\nThere were 30 dedicated quota spots for men's épée. The first 12 spots went to the top fencers by world ranking. Next, 8 more men were selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 each from Europe, the Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Africa. Finally, 10 spots were allocated by continental qualifying events: 4 from Europe, 2 from the Americas, 3 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa.\nAdditionally, there were 8 host/invitational spots that could be spread throughout the various fencing events. Great Britain chose not to use any of its places in the men's épée.\nCompetition format.\nThe épée competition, following the format introduced in 1996, consisted of a five-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period. This sudden-death period was further modified by the selection of a draw-winner beforehand; if neither fencer scored a touch during the minute, the predetermined draw-winner won the bout."

        "text": "The men's foil competition in fencing at the 2012 Olympic Games in London was held on 31 July at the ExCeL London Exhibition Centre. There were 38 competitors from 20 nations. Lei Sheng of China won the gold medal, beating Alaaeldin Abouelkassem from Egypt in the final. It was the first medal in the individual men's foil for each of those nations. Choi Byung-chul of South Korea took bronze. The 2012 podium was the first time since 1904 that no European fencer won a medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Seven of the eight quarterfinalists from 2008 returned: gold medalist Benjamin Kleibrink of Germany, silver medalist Yuki Ota of Japan, fourth-place finisher Zhu Jun of China, fifth-place finisher Peter Joppich of Germany, sixth-place finisher Andrea Cassarà of Italy, seventh-place finisher Erwann Le Péchoux of France, and eighth-place finisher Lei Sheng of China. The Italian team was highly regarded: Cassarà was the reigning world champion, Valerio Aspromonte had been the runner-up to him in 2011, and Andrea Baldini had won the world title in 2009. Germany also sent a strong team, led by defending champion Kleibrink and four-time (2003, 2006, 2007, and 2010) world champion Peter Joppich. Other contenders included Asian champion and three-time world medalist Lei and European champion Aleksey Cheremisinov of Russia.\nCroatia made its debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 24th appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nQualification.\nNations were limited to three fencers each from 1928 to 2004. However, the 2008 Games introduced a rotation of men's team fencing events with one weapon left off each Games; the individual event without a corresponding team event had the number of fencers per nation reduced to two. Men's foil was the first event this applied to, so each nation could enter a maximum of two fencers in the event in 2008. The team foil was back in 2012 (épée the missing weapon for men), so the limit was three for 2012.\nThere were 36 dedicated quota spots for men's foil. The first 24 spots went to the 3 members of each of the 8 qualified teams in the team foil event. Next, 7 more men were selected from the world rankings based on continents: 2 from Europe, 2 from the Americas, 2 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa. Finally, 5 spots were allocated by continental qualifying events: 2 from Europe, 1 from the Americas, 1 from Asia/Oceania, and 1 from Africa.\nAdditionally, there were 8 host/invitational spots that could be spread throughout the various fencing events. Great Britain had already qualified one fencer in the men's foil (Richard Kruse, through individual rankings) and chose to use 2 of its 8 host places to bring its men's foil team up to 3. This made the total number of fencers in the event 38.\nCompetition format.\nThe foil competition consisted of a six-round single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match between the two semifinal losers. Fencing was done to 15 touches or to the completion of three three-minute rounds if neither fencer reached 15 touches by then. At the end of time, the higher-scoring fencer was the winner; a tie resulted in an additional one-minute sudden-death time period.

Clontarf Football Club, the local rugby union club, joined them in 1892, splitting the rent and with the two sports using the same field. The two clubs moved together to the present ground location, off Castle Avenue, in 1896. The club was initially solely a junior one, and won the Junior Cup final in 1898.\nThe club fielded its first international player in 1903, and senior status was attained in 1908. The club suspended operations for the four years from 1914. It won the Leinster Senior League in 1926. Ladies cricket was begun in 1940, ceased in the early 1960s, and resumed in the mid-1970s.\nIn 1947, Clontarf Cricket Club and Clontarf Football Club (the local rugby union club) jointly purchased the Castle Avenue playing grounds, and where before 1947 the clubs shared the same field, from 1947 separate pitches were designated for cricket and rugby. At first the cricket club played nearer Castle Avenue, and the rugby club further away, but they later swapped playing areas.

        "text": "Daniel Paul Muller (born February 21, 1976) is an American college basketball coach, formerly the men's basketball head coach at his alma mater Illinois State University.\nBiography.\nMuller was born in Lafayette, Indiana to parents Cliff and Tricia. He attended Lafayette Central Catholic High School, graduating in 1994.\nAfter high school, Muller attended Illinois State University. On the Illinois State Redbirds men's basketball team, Muller played as a forward from 1994 to 1998 under head coach Kevin Stallings. In his sophomore season, the team finished second in the MVC regular season, and fell to Tulsa in the semifinals of the conference tournament. They earned a bid to the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), where they advanced to the quarterfinals before falling to Tulane. During Muller's final two seasons, the Redbirds won back-to-back MVC regular-season and tournament titles, appearing in the 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Tournaments. In the 1998 tournament, Muller scored the game-winning basket in a first round overtime win against Tennessee.\nMuller finished his career with 1,445 points and made 128 consecutive starts, which remains a school record. He was a two-time Missouri Valley Conference Defensive Player of the Year (1996 &amp; 1997) and earned the MVC Tournament MOP in his senior season (1998). Muller also excelled academically, becoming a Bone Scholar (ISU's highest academic honor) and a two-time GTE Academic All-American. He graduated in 1998 with a bachelor's degree in organizational leadership.\nAfter college, Muller played basketball internationally for two seasons: in Argentina (1999) for Team La Rioja Andino, and Belgium (2000) for Siemens Ghent.\nIn 2001, Muller was hired by his former ISU coach Kevin Stallings as an assistant at Vanderbilt University. He spent 12 years with the Commodores, helping lead the program to seven 20-win seasons and six NCAA tournament appearances. In 2006, he also took over as Vanderbilt's recruiting coordinator, and built some of the highest-rated recruiting classes in school history.\nIn 2012, Muller was hired as the head coach at his alma mater, Illinois State. In his first season, the team posted a 18–15 record and finished 6th in the MVC standings. In 2013-14, they earned a bid to the College Basketball Invitational (CBI), where they advanced to the semifinals before losing to Siena. During the 2014-15 season, the Redbirds finished with a 22–13 record, and made it to the second round of the NIT tournament. Muller's most successful season with the team came in 2016–17, as they went nearly undefeated in conference play (17–1) and finished with a school-record 28 wins (28–7). However, they were unable to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid, as they fell to No. 21 Wichita State in the MVC Tournament Final. Muller was named MVC Coach of the Year following the season.\nIn April 2018, Muller agreed to a 5–year contract extension to remain as head coach of the Redbirds. Despite the extension, the team was unable to sustain their previous success under Muller, as they suffered consecutive losing seasons in 2019–20 and 2020–21 for the first time since 2005–06 and 2006–07. He returned for the 2021–22 season, but the Redbirds struggled to a 11–15 overall record and 4–9 mark in MVC play by mid-February.\nOn February 13, 2022, ISU announced that Muller would be dismissed as head coach following the season, but that he would stay in his position for the remainder of the 2021–22 season at his players' request. However, the next day, he announced that he was stepping down effective immediately, as he was concerned his presence with the team would become a distraction. Muller received a $1 million buyout for the remaining two years on his contract. Following his departure, associate head coach Brian Jones was named as the interim HC for the rest of the season."

Marcel Nguyen of Germany was a two-time European champion.\nAzerbaijan, Bangladesh, Slovakia, and Vietnam each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its 21st appearance, the most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe top eight competitors in the qualification phase (with a limit of two per country) advanced to the apparatus final. Qualification scores were then erased, with only final-round scores counting.\nKōhei Uchimura finished fifth in the qualifying round but did not advance because two other Japanese competitors, Kazuhito and Yusuke Tanaka, placed first and second. With Uchimura ineligible, the ninth-place gymnast would advance, but there was a tie. The normal tie-breakers were unable to separate Zhang Chenglong and Hamilton Sabot, so both advanced."

He has scored centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches on thirty-four and seven occasions respectively. He has played 115 Test and 265 ODI matches for Pakistan, scoring 10000+ and 7,249 runs respectively. He was described by the BBC as \"a dependable member of the strong Pakistan middle order\" and the \"most graceful batsman in the side\". Former Australian captain Michael Clarke said about him that he was \"one of the gentlemen of our game, class player\" and \"a very good player\".\nKhan scored a century on his Test debut against Sri Lanka at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium in 2000, and became the seventh Pakistan player to achieve this feat. His score of 313, against Sri Lanka at the National Stadium, Karachi in 2009, is the third highest total by a Pakistan batsman in Test cricket and the twentieth highest overall. Khan has scored 34 Test centuries at twenty-one cricket grounds, including 27 at venues outside Pakistan. He scored centuries in both innings of a Test match against Australia in January 2014 becoming seventh Pakistani to achieve the feat.\nIn Test cricket, Khan is the first Pakistani batsman to score centuries against all the Test cricket playing teams and only cricketer to score to score centuries in eleven countries. He was most successful against Sri Lanka, making eight Test centuries against them. , he is joint sixth-overall among all-time Test century-makers, and top of the equivalent list for Pakistan.

He is also the only Pakistani batsman to score over 10,000 Test runs. In August 2016, Khan scored his sixth double century (200 or more runs) during Tests to equal Javed Miandad’s record of scoring the most individual double tons for Pakistan in Test cricket. He also became only the second batsman after Kumar Sangakkara to register six scores of more than 200 against six different countries.\nKhan made his ODI debut in February 2000 against Sri Lanka at the National Stadium, Khan's first century came against Hong Kong in July 2004 at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo. His score of 144 is his highest set in an ODI match. , he is tenth in the list of ODI century-makers for Pakistan, a position he shares with Zaheer Abbas. Khan played 25 Twenty20 International (T20I) matches between 2006 and 2010, and never scored a century in the format. His highest score in T20Is remained 51, against Sri Lanka during the 2007 ICC World Twenty20.

Like all other equestrian events, the jumping competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division. There were 75 competitors from 26 nations. The event was won by Steve Guerdat of Switzerland, the nation's first victory in individual jumping since 1924 and second overall (tying the United States for fourth-most). Gerco Schroder of the Netherlands took silver. Cian O'Connor of Ireland, who had been stripped of a gold medal in the event in 2004, earned bronze—Ireland's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 24th appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nNine of the top 14 riders (including ties for 9th place) from the 2008 Games returned: gold medalist Eric Lamaze of Canada, silver medalist (and 2004 fourth-place finisher) Rolf-Göran Bengtsson of Sweden, bronze medalist Beezie Madden of the United States, fourth-place finisher Meredith Michaels-Beerbaum of Germany, fifth-place finisher McLain Ward of the United States, seventh-place finisher Marc Houtzager of the Netherlands, and ninth-place finishers Steve Guerdat of Switzerland, Edwina Alexander of Australia, and Jos Lansink of Belgium. Also returning were Cian O'Connor of Ireland, who had taken gold in 2004 until being stripped of it due to a doping violation, and Rodrigo Pessoa of Brazil, the beneficiary of that disqualification in taking gold in 2004 who had himself had a fifth-place finish in 2008 wiped out by a doping violation. The reigning World Champion was Philippe Le Jeune of Belgium; Lansink (2006) and Pessoa (1998) were also former World Champions. The #1-ranked rider, and European champion, was Bengtsson; he was a favorite along with Pius Schwizer and Steve Guerdat of Switzerland and Nick Skelton of Great Britain.\nSyria made its debut in the event. France and the United States both competed for the 21st time, tied for most of any nation.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could qualify up to 4 horse and rider pairs; there were a total of 75 quota places. Each of the 15 nations qualified for the team jumping could enter 4 pairs in the individual event. The qualified teams were:\nThere were also 15 individual qualification places, with NOCs not earning team spots able to earn up to 2 individual spots. All of these places were assigned by regional groups:\nCompetition format.\nFive rounds of jumping were conducted, in two stages. The first three rounds made up the qualifications, with cuts between each round. The top 60 advanced to the second round; the top 45 advanced to the third round. The second and third rounds were also used for the team jumping event. Following the qualifications, the top 35 pairs moved on to the final round. Only the top 20 pairs advanced to the second of the two final rounds. Final rankings were based on the sum of scores from both rounds of the final stage. A jump-off would be held to break a tie for any of the medal positions.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nRound 1.\nThe first qualifying round was run on a relatively easy course with a length of 510 m and an allowed time of 1:22.\nRound 2.\nThe course for the second round was 550 m long with an allowed time of 1:28.\nRound 3.\nThe course for the third round was 550 meters long (with 13 fences) with an allowed time of 1:28.\nBengtsson withdrew from the final when his horse, Casall, turned up lame the morning of the final. Two riders (Muff and Vrieling) were ineligible as the fourth-best riders from their nations. The qualifying rank thus went from 35 to 38. A three-way tie for 38th resulted in all three advancing, for a total of 37 finalists.\nFinal round.\nRound A.\nO'Connor, who had only reached the final due to Bengtsson's withdrawal, took advantage of the fresh scoring, as one of six riders to clear round A cleanly."

The Sycamores finished as the national runner-up with a record of 27–7; they lost to Louisville by a score of 82-70 in the title game. This season represented Indiana State's second NAIA Final Four, its second national title game and its second national runner-up finish.\nRegular season.\nDuring the 1947–48 season, Indiana State finished the regular season to finish 23–6, 7–0 in the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference; they won by an average of 18 points per game, setting a new school scoring record, (2,287 points). They finished the season at 29-7; the second highest win total in school history.\nCoach John Wooden's second team sprinted out of the gate, winning 11 of their first 12 games; including the mid-season Mid-Western Tournament over Georgetown (KY), Southeastern Oklahoma and Northeast Missouri. They won their 2nd consecutive Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title, qualifying for the NAIA Tournament.\nPost-season.\nIn 1947, Wooden's first basketball team won the Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title and received an invitation to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIB) National Tournament in Kansas City. Wooden refused the invitation, citing the NAIB's policy banning African American players; one of Wooden's players was Clarence Walker, an African-American from East Chicago, Indiana.\nIn 1948, after winning their 2nd Conference title, Indiana State was again invited to the NAIB tournament; the NAIB had reversed its policy banning African-American players that year, and Wooden coached his team to the NAIB National Tournament final, losing to Louisville. This was the only championship game a Wooden-coached team ever lost. That year, Walker became the first African-American to play in any post-season intercollegiate basketball tournament, as the NIT and NCAA tournaments did not integrate until after 1950.\nIn Kansas City they won their first five games to reach the NAIA Finals. In game 3 vs. San Jose State, the Sycamores were trailing in the second half when Bob Royer, sparked a rally, the Sycamores would win by 7 to reach the Semifinals vs. Hamline. Duane Klueh received several honors at the end of regular season. He won the Chuck Taylor Award as the Most Valuable Player of the Year in the NAIA, he was also selected to the NAIA All-American team. Joining him on the All-Tournament Team was Bob Royer, who was making his 2nd All-Tournament team. Royer was again a member of the All-Tournament Team in 1949 as Indiana State finished 4th in the tournament.\nRoster.\nThe Sycamores were led by All-American Klueh, the NAIA Player of the Year, with 17.6 average. He was followed by Don McDonald's 9.4 average. The starting lineup featured four future 1,000 career point scorers; Klueh, Don McDonald, the 1950 Chuck Taylor Award-winner Lenny Rzeszewski, and Bob Royer. The roster also included future Indiana Basketball Hall of Famer, Jim Powers, who became high school coach to UCLA All-American Michael Warren.\nSeniors\nJuniors\nSophomores\nCoaches"

        "title": "1973 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 1973 Kentucky Derby was the 99th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Secretariat won the Derby in a record time of 1:, lengths ahead of Sham, while Our Native finished in third position. Of the thirteen horses that entered and started the race, all horses completed the event. The event was viewed in person by a then-record crowd of 134,476, while also being broadcast both on television and over the radio.\nIn the days leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the favorite to win by many; however there were doubts about him following a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.\nShecky Greene took the lead first and led for the majority of the first seven furlongs. Sham took the lead from Shecky Greene near the three quarter mile mark. As the horses entered the homestretch, Secretariat passed Sham in the final furlong and distanced himself to consolidate his lead. Secretariat would go on to win the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes in the succeeding weeks, thus becoming the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.\nPre-race coverage.\nThirteen horses entered the Derby, which could have at most twenty participants. Horse owners had to pay a final entry fee of $2,500 to have their horses officially entered. The field was larger than anticipated because of new entries following Secretariat's loss at the Wood Memorial Stakes in New York.\nThe Wood Memorial had been the last prep race for three year-olds before the Kentucky Derby. It was a mile contest held two weeks prior at Aqueduct Racetrack. Angle Light, whom groom Edward Sweat called a \"very quiet horse,\" won the race by a length ahead of Sham, while Secretariat finished in third, four lengths behind. Secretariat's third-place finish led spectators and sportswriters to question his ability and health; but it was later thought that his performance in the Wood had been affected by a mouth abscess discovered prior to the race. It was his first defeat since he had finished fourth in his first race and had been relegated from first to second place because of an infraction during the Champagne Stakes, both of which occurred during his two-year-old campaign.\nSecretariat was nonetheless the morning line favorite of the Derby entrants, despite losing the Wood. This was because he had been 1972 American Horse of the Year for a two-year-old campaign that featured seven victories in nine starts. Secretariat also won the two races he had entered prior to the Wood Memorial, the Gotham and Bay Shore Stakes. Sham's trainer, Frank \"Pancho\" Martin, stated that Secretariat was the horse to beat and the only way to \"knock\" the horse was to beat him.\nSham, who had won the Santa Anita Derby, was seen as the most formidable challenger to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off the heels of his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin along with Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.\nFlorida Derby winner Royal and Regal had been suffering some problems with his feet going into the race and was seen as a horse that could potentially be scratched before the race began. Shecky Greene, Angle Light, and Royal and Regal were thought to be the only horses in the field that had \"appreciable early speed\" and would challenge to be the leader out of the gates. My Gallant was to be ridden by Angel Cordero, but Cordero was suspended for ten days starting the day of the Derby for a rules infraction on a race on May 2. Braulio Baeza was chosen to jockey My Gallant, after being dropped by the owners of Shecky Greene in advance of the race because they were unsure whether that horse would be entered into the Derby. Larry Adams was ultimately selected as the jockey for Shecky Greene. With the speed of the horses entered, many thought that the course record of 2:00 would be broken.\n\"Chicago Tribune\" writer David Condon chose Shecky Greene to win the race because he felt the course was suited for him and because his great-grandfather was Bull Lea, who sired three Derby winners. Condon picked Warbucks as his second-place finisher because Warbucks' trainer, Don Combs, trained the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner Dust Commander and his jockey, Bill Hartack, was \"long overdue\" for a win and would have Warbucks near the front. Gerald Strine of \"The Washington Post\" believed Sham could win the race if he allowed Shecky Greene or Royal and Regal to lead the majority of the race and made a move towards the end. Strine picked Sham to win and My Gallant to finish second.\nEvent details.\nDerby officials set the official post-time at 5:40 PM EDT. It was broadcast over television and radio through CBS and WCBS, respectively. Win Elliot served as the commentator for the pre-race coverage, while Ray Haight announced it for the third consecutive year. All horses competing carried weights of 126 pounds. The prize money for the race was set at $198,800. The first through fourth placed horses received $155,050, $25,000, $12,500, and $5,000, respectively. The weather during the Derby was clear and the course conditions were fast.\nThe official attendance of the event was 134,476, of which 70,000 were estimated to be in the infield of Churchill Downs. This surpassed the previous Derby record of 130,564; however the record lasted only a year as the 1974 edition attracted 163,628 spectators. Dwight Chapin of \"Los Angeles Times\" and author Timothy Capps credited the increased attendance due to Secretariat's loss at the Wood.\nRace summary.\nTwice a Prince reared in the starting gate, which delayed the start. Out of the starting gate, Shecky Greene set the pace for the field, while race favorite Secretariat started in last place. Exiting the gate, Sham hit his mouth against the gate and subsequently bumped into Navajo before gaining proper stride. Sham briefly took the lead around the quarter-mile marker, but Shecky Greene quickly retook the lead. Beginning the first turn, Secretariat had moved ahead of only two horses; however, in the next quarter-mile Secretariat moved into sixth position. A half-mile in, Shecky Greene maintained a three length lead over Gold Bag, but his pace had slowed compared to the first quarter. Sham remained close to the front of the field within the top four for the first half of the race; he moved into second position as the field reached the half-mile post. At the three-quarters post, at the start of the homestretch, Shecky Greene began to fade and Sham overtook him to move into first going into the final furlong. Secretariat, who had passed his competitors on the outside throughout the race, overtook Sham in the final furlong and pulled ahead, finishing horse lengths in front of Sham. Our Native took third and Forego, who went on to win multiple Eclipse Awards as an older horse, was fourth.\nSecretariat's winning time of 1: and last quarter mile in 23 seconds were both records for the Derby. In addition, he had run each quarter-mile faster than before, with times of , 24, , , and 23 seconds. Furthermore, Secretariat became the first horse in Derby history to run the race in under 2 minutes at the 1 mile distance. Sham maintained his stride and crossed the line in second place, eight lengths ahead of third-place finisher Our Native, who had lost ground on the final turn into the homestretch. Sham also broke the previous course record with a time of 1:. Shecky Greene, who led for most of the race, finished in sixth position.\nAnalysis.\nThe win in the Kentucky Derby marked Secretariat's third win in the four races he had run as a three-year-old. After the race, jockey Ron Turcotte stated, in response to Secretariat's last place start, he \"just dropped my hand on him and let him run his own race.\" With Secretariat's victory, trainer Lucien Laurin had his second consecutive win in the Derby, as Riva Ridge won in 1972. Turcotte accomplished a similar feat as he had ridden Riva Ridge, marking the third time a jockey had won in the Derby in consecutive years.\nWhen Secretariat pulled alongside Sham, Sham's jockey, Laffit Pincay Jr., felt Sham had a lot left, \"but that other horse was just too much.\" Pincay stated that in future races, he planned to \"wait a little longer before making my move.\" Donald Brumfield, Our Native's jockey said Twice a Prince kicked Our Native in the hoof and body while rearing in the starting gate. This forced Brumfield to dismount and adjust the saddle, delaying the Derby's start. Despite this, Brumfield stated he did not \"want to make excuses, everything considered, my horse did fine.\"\nBetting on the ten races held that day at Churchill Downs totaled to $7,627,965, breaking the previous single-day record for American horse racing events of $7,164,717. Off-track betting on the Kentucky Derby reached $3,050,194, which was included in the previous record total.\nSecretariat went on to participate in the Preakness Stakes two weeks later, where he finished in first. Sham was second, again, by a margin of lengths. Three weeks after the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes featured a five-horse field. Secretariat won by 31 lengths with a time of 2:24 for the mile and a half, both course records in their own right. Through his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were course records and still stand to this day."

        "text": "The 1973 Preakness Stakes was the 98th running of the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland held on May 19, 1973. Six horses entered, and Secretariat won by lengths ahead of Sham in front of a record crowd of 61,657 spectators. The race was viewed on television and broadcast over the radio.\nIn the period leading up to the Preakness, Kentucky Derby winner Secretariat was pegged as the favorite to win the race. Aside from Secretariat, Sham was named as the only other horse that could win the race or even challenge Secretariat. Initially seven horses officially enrolled to race in the event, but the field reduced to six after an owner scratched his horse. The entrants in the Preakness featured three horses that did not compete in the Derby. At the start, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. After reaching the lead with furlongs to go, he was never challenged, and won by lengths, Sham finishing second and Our Native third. The victory led to the stallion being featured on several magazine covers. Secretariat would go on to win the Belmont Stakes in the succeeding weeks, becoming the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing and the first in 25 years.\nThe timing of the race was questioned, as the official clock malfunctioned and the official timer recorded a result slower than that recorded by clockers for the \"Daily Racing Form\", who maintained that Secretariat had set a record. The dispute was not resolved until 2012, when newer technology allowed for a forensic review of the videotapes and an accurate calculation of the actual time, which was formally recorded as 1:53, a record time for the race still standing .\nPre-race activity.\nBetween the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of whom had run in the Derby, were all named as possible entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and Our Native, all raced in the Kentucky Derby two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were Our Native, Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was unsure about racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or Our Native. In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that Our Native registered, dropping the total number of horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible. An Associated Press article commented that the credentials of Secretariat and Sham could lead to the running being one of the smallest since 1964.\nFollowing his record-breaking victory at the Kentucky Derby, Secretariat was the favorite. In the days between the Derby and the Preakness, groom Eddie Sweat noted that it was strange not having any rumors circulating about Secretariat's health. Sham and Secretariat were ridden by the same jockeys as in the Derby, Laffit Pincay, Jr. and Ron Turcotte, respectively. Sham was believed to have the best chance of beating Secretariat. Aside from Sham and Secretariat, Our Native was selected by Joe Nichols, a writer for \"The New York Times\", as an outside contender for victory. In pre-race interviews, Deadly Dream's trainer Bud Delp believed he could challenge for third place as he had no \"illusions about beating Secretariat and Sham.\"\nOf the remaining contenders, Deadly Dream had won the fourth race of his three-year-old campaign at Penn National, previously winning the Allegheny Stakes and the Militia Handicap. In total, he won seven races out of the 25 he had started. Ecole Etage had won two races in the 1973 season, prior to the Preakness, the General George Stakes and the Preakness Prep. Torsion entered the race with a most recent finish of fifth place in the Preakness Prep and two wins in twelve career starts, one as a two-year-old and one as a three-year-old.\nEvent details.\nPost time for the race was 5:40 PM EDT. It was broadcast over television and radio through CBS. The television coverage lasted approximately an hour, while radio coverage ran twenty minutes. The horses entering the race all carried 126 pounds. The total purse for the Preakness was $182,400, with the first through fourth-place finishers to receive $129,900, $30,000, $15,000, and $7,500, respectively. The weather during the race was clear and the course conditions were fast. The day at the Preakness was dubbed \"Johnny Unitas Day\" in honor of the quarterback's seventeen seasons with the Baltimore Colts, following being traded to San Diego by owner Joe Thomas before the start of the 1973 season. Members of the Johnny Unitas fan club gathered in the infield of Pimilico, the Unitas Corral.\nRace officials expected a record turnout in the days leading up to the Preakness, estimating over 50,000 people. They hoped that the possibility of Secretariat completing the Triple Crown and Sham attempting to foil Secretariat's run would lead to an increase in attendance. The official attendance for the event was reported at 61,657, which surpassed the previous record of 48,721 people set in 1972. The new record lasted until 1975 when 75,216 spectators were present at Pimlico.\nRace summary.\nOut of the starting gate, Ecole Etage took the lead, ahead of Torsion, while race favorite Secretariat exited last. Sham and Deadly Dream made contact exiting the gate. While Sham was able to successfully gain stride, Deadly Dream began to run towards the railing and collided with it when entering the first turn. Going into the course's first turn, Secretariat passed two horses on the outside and passed the remainder as the horses entered the backstretch. Sham was the only horse that was able to stay with Secretariat's acceleration. Secretariat held the lead for the remainder of the race and crossed the finish line in first position, lengths ahead of Sham. Our Native placed third, eight lengths behind Sham. This was the first time in the history of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes that the top three horses in the Derby finished in the same positions at the Preakness.\nTiming controversy.\nUpon the finish of the race there was a dispute over the winning time of Secretariat. The electronic Visumatic timer on the field read 1:55, while \"Daily Racing Form\" clockers Gene Schwartz and Frank Robinson timed Secretariat at 1:, which would have broken the track record. The official fractional times were 25, , 1:12, and 1:, while the \"Daily Racing Forum\" timed the fractions at , 47, 1:, and 1:. The next day, Secretariat's trainer Lucien Laurin asked for the videotape to be reviewed because he felt that if Secretariat did run that fast, then \"he deserves the record.\" On May 21, race officials adjusted Secretariat's winning time to 1:, becoming the then second fastest time in race history. The time was changed to the time obtained by the official Pimilico timekeeper E.T. McLean per Rule 383 of the Maryland Rules of Racing, which stated the \"official timer's time is official.\" McLean's stopwatch was faster than the Visumatic by three-fifths of a second at each fractional.\" That same day, a Visumatic official checked the timer and stated that the timer should have actually read 1:, rather than 1:55. It was determined that the chart for the Preakness would display McLean's time as the winning time, with the \"Daily Racing Forum\" time written next to it, in parentheses.\nSecretariat's owner Penny Chenery and Maryland Jockey Club president Thomas Chuckas asked the Maryland Racing Commission to review the 1973 Preakness. On June 19, 2012, the commission announced their findings. During a three-hour meeting, the tapes of Secretariat's run and the three new record-holding runs were overlaid by three separate companies from which a total of five analysts reviewed the footage. Following all five analysts obtaining the time of 1:53, the commission unanimously voted to change Secretariat's time from 1:54 to 1:53, which broke the then-course record of 1:53. Altering Secretariat's time allowed him to actively hold the course record for all three legs of the Triple Crown. The overlaying method used by the committee was reported to be accurate to 0.03 of a second. A representative of Chenery stated that they were \"very pleased\" with the decision.\nAnalysis.\nBy winning the Preakness, Secretariat earned his fourth victory in five races as a three-year-old. This was the first victory for Lucien Laurin in his four attempts to win the Preakness. Jockey Ron Turcotte secured his second Preakness victory, having previously won with Tom Rolfe in 1965. It was Meadow Stables' second win at the Stakes as they were previously victorious with Hill Prince in 1950. Following the race, Laurin stated that \"Now, we're going to try and win the Belmont.\" Torsion's jockey Ben Feliciano said, in regards to Secretariat, \"He's the best.\"\nBetting on the races held that day at Pimlico Stakes totaled to $3,792,076, which set the Maryland record for amount of money wagered for the day. Off-track betting on the Preakness Stakes reached $922,989, which was included in the previous record total.\nThree weeks after the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes featured a five-horse field. Secretariat won by 31 lengths with a time of 2:24 for the mile and a half, both course records in their own right. Through his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. After his time in the Preakness was reviewed and found to be a record, Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were stakes records and stand to this day."

        "title": "1999 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 1999 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 1999 NRL season. It was contested by the competition's two newest clubs: the Melbourne Storm, competing in only its second year (having finished the regular season in 3rd place); and the St. George Illawarra Dragons, in their first year as a joint-venture club (having finished the regular season in 6th place), after both sides eliminated the rest of the top eight during the finals.\nA new rugby league world record crowd of 107,999 was at Stadium Australia for the game. The attendance, which saw 67,142 more people attend than had done so for the 1998 NRL Grand Final at the Sydney Football Stadium, broke the record attendance for a Grand Final, eclipsing the previous record of 78,065 set in 1965 when St. George defeated South Sydney 12–8 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. It was the last time that the Clive Churchill Medal was presented in a case before it was changed the following season where it is presented separately with a ribbon being worn around the neck. Due to its competitive nature, It has been regarded as one of the greatest NRL grand finals of all time.\nPre-match entertainment featured Hugh Jackman's rendition of the Australian national anthem.\nBackground.\nThe 1999 NRL season was the 92nd season of professional rugby league football in Australia, and the second to be run by the National Rugby League. With the exclusion of the Adelaide Rams and Gold Coast Chargers, and the merger of the St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers, seventeen teams competed for the NRL Premiership during the 1999 season, which culminated in the first grand final to be played at Stadium Australia.\nMelbourne Storm.\nThe 1999 Melbourne Storm season was the second in the club's history. Coached by Chris Anderson and captained by Glenn Lazarus, they competed in the NRL's 1999 Telstra Premiership, finishing the regular season in 3rd (out of 17).\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons.\nThe 1999 St. George Illawarra Dragons season was the first in the newly formed joint-venture club's history. Coached by David Waite and Andrew Farrar, and captained by Paul McGregor, they competed in the NRL's 1999 Telstra Premiership, finishing the regular season in 6th place (out of 17).\nMatch details.\nSt. George Illawara were up 14–0 at half time, with a converted try and penalty goal to Craig Fitzgibbon, and a converted try to Nathan Blacklock. However, an Anthony Mundine knock-on over the try line early in the second half proved to be a major turning point in the match, with Melbourne running in tries through Tony Martin and Ben Roarty and winger Craig Smith kicking two penalty goals. An unconverted try to Dragons captain Paul McGregor couldn't stem Melbourne's momentum, with Craig Smith kicking the Storm to within four points of the Dragons at 18–14.\nIn the 77th minute the Storm forced the Dragons to a goal line dropout. Melbourne's halfback Brett Kimmorley then bombed to Craig Smith's wing. Dragons Jamie Ainscough, anticipating a Melbourne try, caught Smith in a head-high tackle over the try-line, resulting in Smith being knocked unconscious and, in the process of falling to the ground, Smith knocking on. Referee Bill Harrigan requested video referee Chris Ward adjudicate on the decision. The Melbourne Storm were granted a penalty try, drawing them level with the Dragons. Being a penalty try, the subsequent conversion was taken from directly in front of the posts. Matt Geyer was successful in the conversion and the Storm, for the first time in the match, pulled ahead of the Dragons and took out their first grand final 20–18.\nThe Melbourne side thus became the quickest expansion team to win a premiership, eclipsing the Canterbury side who won the 1938 premiership in just their fourth season. It was the last game of champion prop and captain Glenn Lazarus, who retired after a remarkable fifth grand final victory (having won premierships with the Canberra Raiders in 1989 and 1990 and with the Brisbane Broncos in 1992 and 1993).\nFor traditional St. George fans the loss was hard to take. The club were unsuccessful in their four previous visits to the grand final (1985, 1992, 1993 and 1996) and had not won a premiership since 1979. It would not be until 2010 that they would return to another Grand Final, in which it would win its first premiership as a joint-venture.\nThe grand final attracted a television viewership of over 600,000 in Melbourne, a traditional Australian Rules football stronghold.\nScoreboard.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;"

        "text": "The 2000 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2000 NRL season. It was contested by the Brisbane Broncos, who had finished the season in 1st place, and the Sydney Roosters, who had finished the season in 2nd place. The Brisbane Broncos were favourites heading into the grand final with the Sydney Roosters as underdogs. Brisbane were premiership favourites for most of the season after leading the competition every round since round 4. It was their fifth grand final appearance in nine years, while it was the first for the Roosters in twenty years. The attendance of 94,277 was the third highest ever seen at a rugby league match in Australia. It was the first time that the Clive Churchill Medal was presented separately with a ribbon being worn around the neck, as previously it was presented in a case.\nBackground.\nThe 2000 NRL season was the 93rd season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the third to be run by the National Rugby League. Fourteen teams competed from February until August for the minor premiership before the top eight teams played in the finals series, which culminated in the grand final. The season and grand final were played a month earlier than usual due to the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney during September.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nThe 2000 Brisbane Broncos season was the thirteenth in the club's history. Coached by Wayne Bennett and captained by Kevin Walters, they finished the regular season 1st (out of 14 teams) to claim their 4th minor premiership. The Broncos played two finals matches (against the 8th-placed Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks then the 7th-placed Parramatta Eels), winning both to qualify for their 5th grand final.\nSydney Roosters.\nThe 2000 Sydney Roosters season was the 93rd in the club's history. Coached by Graham Murray and captained by Brad Fittler, they finished the regular season 2nd (out of 14 teams). After losing their first finals match, the Roosters won their next two to reach their 18th grand final.\nTeams.\nFor Brisbane, Shane Webcke went into the match with a broken arm, with Tonie Carroll also under an injury cloud. It was revealed after the match that Darren Lockyer was also in doubt due to illness.\nSydney Roosters forward Luke Ricketson was in doubt up until the day of the match due to a hamstring injury.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nSydney were unlucky not to have an early lead only three minutes in when Shannon Hegarty got over the line, but good cover defence by Brisbane fullback Darren Lockyer stopped the Roosters from scoring. The Broncos opened the scoring with a penalty goal to Michael De Vere to make it 2–0 at the 12th minute. Four minutes later, Lote Tuqiri scored the first try of the grand final which was converted by De Vere to make it 8–0 in Brisbane's favour. Michael De Vere extended his side's lead out to 10–0 with another penalty goal in the 27th minute. The Roosters opened their scoring in the 35th minute with a penalty goal to Luke Phillips to make it 10–2 and it remained that scoreline until halftime.\nSecond half.\nIn the first minute of play after the break, Broncos five-eighth Ben Ikin got hit late with a high shot and went to the bench, missing twenty minutes of the second half. Brisbane had a chance to go ten in front with a penalty goal but missed marginally. However the Broncos extended their lead to 14–2 when Wendell Sailor scored in the 56th minute, but the conversion was unsuccessful by De Vere. Craig Fitzgibbon got Sydney's first try of the match in the 71st minute to give the Roosters a glimmer of hope, but his conversion was unsuccessful as it dropped onto the cross bar and bounced out, leaving the score 14–6.\nScoreboard.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;"

        "title": "2001 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2001 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2001 NRL season. It was contested at Stadium Australia in Sydney by the Newcastle Knights (who had finished the regular season in third place), and the Parramatta Eels (who had finished the regular season in first place), after the other six teams that had competed in the top-eight finals series had been eliminated. The attendance of 90,414 was the fourth highest ever seen at a rugby league match in Australia and it was the first nighttime grand final in the competition’s 93-year history. Domestically, live free-to-air television coverage was provided by Nine's Wide World of Sports. The match was also broadcast live in the United States by Fox Sports World. Newcastle Knights won, with their captain Andrew Johns receiving the Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match.\nBackground.\nThe 2001 NRL season was the 94th season of professional rugby league football in Australia and the fourth run by the National Rugby League. Also called the 2001 Telstra Premiership (due to sponsorship from Telstra Corporation), it was contested by 13 Australian-based clubs plus one New Zealand-based club. Parramatta had also finished as minor premiers, breaking several records in the process which, as of 2021, still stand, including most points scored in a regular season, most points scored in a full season and most tries scored in a season.\nNewcastle had finished in third place at the end of the regular season with 16 wins, 9 losses, and a singular draw. They defeated the 2000 runner-ups, the Sydney Roosters in the first week of the finals and Cronulla-Sutherland in the preliminary final to progress through to the grand final.\nMatch details.\nFirst half.\nNewcastle were first to score with a try to Bill Peden in the third minute, with Andrew Johns converting to take the Knights out to a 6–0 lead. Four minutes later, the Newcastle side scored again through Steve Simpson, with Johns failing to convert, taking the score to 10–0. Johns not long after took a shot at penalty goal due to a leg pull from Brad Drew which was penalised by referee Bill Harrigan to make the score 12–0. By the 24th minute, Newcastle already had an 18–0 lead to the courtesy of Peden’s second try and another conversion by Johns.\nNot long after, the Parramatta side had their best chance of the first half with Andrew Ryan getting over the line but he was held up by Simpson (who was injured in the process of making the tackle) and failed to score. In the following set, Parramatta spread the ball wide to the left, but a pass which would have put Luke Burt in for a try in the corner was directed well behind him and he failed to catch it. In the 32nd minute, Ben Kennedy scored for the Newcastle club, with Johns converting again to take the score to 24–0. Parramatta had a couple of chances in the Knights’ half after that but failed to capitalise on their opportunities ,so the score remained the same until half time. The 24 points scored by Newcastle remains the highest total by a team in the first half of a grand final and the biggest ever grand final half-time lead.\nSecond half.\nParramatta were the first to score in the second half to make the score 24–6. In the 64th minute, Newcastle seemed to have wrapped up the 2001 Premiership following a wide pass from Peden to Johns who put up a towering bomb to Timana Tahu's wing. Tahu got tangled up with Burt before getting the ball down about 50 cm inside the touch-in-goal line. Two minutes later, however, Jamie Lyon scored for Parramatta to make it 28–12, thus keeping the Eels in the game. Three minutes later, the Newcastle side once again made the margin three converted tries at 30–12 thanks to a penalty goal to Johns after an attempted short goal-line drop-out by Drew went out on the full. One more try each to both Lyon and Brett Hodgson in the final ten minutes got the scoreline back to a difference of a converted try at 30–24, but despite this comeback, there was to be no further scoring in the match, leaving the Newcastle side to clinch the 2001 Premiership, their second title in five seasons. The combined tally of 54 points for the match remains the second-highest in a grand final after the 1951 Grand Final in which 56 were scored (an era during which tries were worth only three points). The 2001 decider was also the first grand final in which 20 or more points were scored in both halves, a feat which was replicated in the 2020 NRL Grand Final.\nNewcastle have not played in another grand final since then, whilst Parramatta were unsuccessful in both 2009 when the club lost to the Melbourne Storm, and 2022 when the club lost to Penrith Panthers, stretching their premiership drought which goes back to 1986.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nAftermath.\nIn 2011, 10 years after Newcastle's grand final victory, Kennedy spoke to the media at The Once a Knight reunion lunch recalling his memories of the 2001 final. Kennedy said \"They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time\". Newcastle centre Mark Hughes recalled the game saying \"I remember how nervous and stiff Parramatta were\". \"The Parramatta players came dressed to the grand final breakfast wearing \"Miami Vice black suits.\"\nNewcastle prop Josh Perry said of the week building up to the game that he knew Newcastle were going to win saying \"It started at the midweek grand final breakfast. We lined up next to Parramatta to walk out onto the stage, and they were so tense. They weren't talking to us, while we were being ourselves and having a joke and enjoying the moment – they were anything but that. From that moment on we knew we were going to win.\" Parramatta captain Nathan Cayless in 2017 spoke of the game saying \"It was disappointing for us, and it took a long time to get into another grand final [2009]. We'd had a good season, and just wanted to stick to what we had done, and what worked for us so well. We didn’t change too much and just looked at it as if it were another game of football. Newcastle just played out of their skins\"."

It was contested by the Sydney Roosters, who had finished the regular season in 1st place, and the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, who had finished the regular season in 2nd place. After both sides eliminated the rest of 2004's top eight teams over the finals series, they faced each other in a grand final for the first time since the 1980 NSWRFL season's decider.\nBackground.\nFor the second consecutive year, the NRL grand final featured two Sydney-based teams.\nSydney Roosters.\nThe Sydney Roosters finished the 2004 regular season in 1st place, taking out the minor premiership. They subsequently won their two finals matches against the Canberra Raiders 38–12 and then the North Queensland Cowboys 19–16 to make their third consecutive grand final and their fourth in five seasons.\nCanterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs.\nThe Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs (that season known as just the Bulldogs) finished the 2004 regular season 2nd (out of 15). They lost their first match of the finals series against the North Queensland Cowboys 22–30 but won their next two against the Melbourne Storm 43–18 and the Penrith Panthers 30–14 to reach their first grand final since 1998.\nTeams.\nLuke Ricketson would miss the match through suspension, after he was found guilty and suspended for three matches by the NRL Judiciary in the week leading up to the grand final. Ricketson had been charged with a grade three striking charge in the Roosters preliminary final victory over North Queensland. Roosters centre Justin Hodges was more fortunate than Ricketson, escaping suspension for a suspect tackle in the same match. Teammate Chris Flannery would take his place on the bench for the Roosters against doctor's orders, after being rushed to hospital for surgery on a ruptured testicle suffered in the preliminary final. It was also former Australian captain Brad Fittler's last game of first grade rugby league before retirement.\nRegular Bulldogs captain Steve Price was ruled out of the match after injuring his knee in the preliminary final against Penrith. He was replaced as captain by Andrew Ryan. \nMatch details.\nPre-match entertainment included performances by Chris Isaak and Australian rock band Grinspoon.\nFirst half.\nAfter 13 minutes, Sydney took the first try of the game with Chris Walker scoring the try and Craig Fitzgibbon converting giving Sydney a 6–0 lead. Ten minutes later winger Matt Utai scored the first try for the Bulldogs bringing the score back to 6–4, after Hazem El Masri missing the conversion attempt. A few minutes later El Masri levelled the scores at 6–6 with a penalty goal. Just after the 30 minute mark, Brett Finch kicked a field goal to give Sydney a narrow 7–6 lead. Two minutes later Anthony Tupou made a 30-metre break for Sydney before passing to teammate Anthony Minichiello to cross under the posts with Fitzgibbon converting to give Sydney a 13–6 lead. At the 37th minute, Minichiello looked to have his second try, however the try was denied by the video referee and the Roosters penalised for an obstruction.\nSecond half.\nTwo minutes into the second half, Utai got his second try with El Masri converting, bringing the score back to 13–12. In the 53rd minute El Masri crossed over for a try, which was awarded by the video referee despite Roosters players complaints of a double movement. El Masri would narrowly missed the conversion, but his try would give the Bulldogs the lead 16–13. With one minute left and the score remaining at 16–13, Sydney's Michael Crocker made a half break on the Bulldogs 40-meter line, but was tackled by stand in Bulldogs captain Andrew Ryan, resulting in Crocker losing the ball.

Due to sponsorship, the race was known as the Kentucky Derby Presented by Yum! Brands. The race was televised in the United States on the NBC television network.\nThe race was won by I'll Have Another, ridden by Mario Gutierrez, with a time of 2:01.83, while favorite Bodemeister finished second and Dullahan was third.\nA record crowd of 165,307 was on hand at the track for the race.\nContenders.\nPrior to the race, the field was considered \"unusually strong\"; four time Derby winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas called it the \"best bunch I've seen in a long time\". The major contenders were Bodemeister (Arkansas Derby), Union Rags (Champagne, Fountain of Youth Stakes), Gemologist (Wood Memorial), Creative Cause (Norfolk, San Felipe Stakes), Take Charge Indy (Florida Derby), Dullahan (Blue Grass Stakes) and Hansen (Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Gotham Stakes). I'll Have Another went off as a relative longshot at 15:1 despite winning both the Robert B. Lewis and Santa Anita Derby.\nRace.\nThunderstorms the night before led to the cancellation of morning training for the riders, and, at 8:00 am EST, the track was labeled \"sloppy\". However, closer to the race, conditions were upgraded to \"fast\", the best condition for a dirt track. My Adonis was drawn into the race as an also eligible entry. If there were any entries that scratched, My Adonis would have been able to start in the race.\nBodemeister, ridden by Mike E. Smith, was leading at the quarter-mile mark with a time of 22.32 seconds. Bodemeister maintained his lead at the half-mile mark, at 45.39 seconds. During the final furlong, I'll Have Another overtook Bodemeister to win by one and a half lengths. I'll Have Another was the first Kentucky Derby winner to win from post barrier 19, while Mario Gutierrez won on his first attempt in the Kentucky Derby. Union Rags, the second-favorite to win at 9:2 odds, finished seventh.\nAll-sources wagering on the Kentucky Derby race was also record setting, up 18.8% from 112.0-million to $133.1-million. The previous record for all-sources wagering on the Kentucky Derby race was $118.4-million and was established in 2006.\nPayout.\nThe 138th Kentucky Derby Payout Schedule\nField.\nThe field was announced on May 2, 2012.\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nSeveral horses in the Derby went on to subsequent Grade I wins."

Taylor defeated Russia's Sofya Ochigava in the final.\nBronze medals were awarded to both semi-final losers: Adriana Araujo from Brazil and Mavzuna Chorieva from Tajikistan — the latter being the country's only medal at the 2012 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of a single-elimination tournament. Bronze medals were awarded to both semi-final losers. Bouts were four rounds of two minutes each.\nInternational media coverage of Taylor.\nKatie Taylor's Olympic boxing success led to inaccurate coverage in the international media. While previewing her semi-final bout, \"The Daily Telegraph\", a conservative English newspaper, incorrectly referred to Taylor as \"British\", prompting fierce criticism from other media outlets, and an apology from the \"Telegraph\". Fairfax Media of Australia also issued an apology, after articles published in \"The Age\", \"Brisbane Times\" and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" were widely condemned as \"lazy stereotyping\" of the Irish. Irish Ambassador to Australia Noel White issued a formal complaint about the article's reliance on Guinness, whiskey and potatoes to make a story. \"USA Today\" was criticised after its article said: “Back home on the emerald-green isle, pints of Guinness flowed freely, perhaps enough to replenish the Irish Sea. The \"punters\" inside betting parlors [sic] wagered pounds [sic] as if they were bits of candy. It is not hyperbole to suggest that, when Taylor entered the ring, the weight of a prideful, scuffling nation rested on her muscular shoulders.” Also, Australian commentator Russell Barwick provoked \"fury\" while on ESPN, comparing Team Ireland's independence from Team GB to Tasmanian athletes not performing for Australia."

He was named all-conference and all-region teams as well as being ranked No. 40 best junior college player by Rivals.com. As a sophomore, he was the fourth-leading scorer in the NJCAA Division I recording 26 points per game. In addition he contributed 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals.\nLamar University.\nIn 2010, James transferred to a NCAA Division I school, Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. Here he played under coach Steve Roccaforte in 2010–11 and under coach Pat Knight for the 2011–12 NCAA season. Playing a little over 18 minutes a game, he averaged 12.5 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.1 steals. He led the team in scoring, even though he only started two out of twenty-four games for the season. He registered a 52-point game on January 4, 2011, against Louisiana College, which the Lamar Cardinals won 114–62, breaking the previous record of 50 set by Mike Oliver in 1980. In addition, he broke Lamar University's Montagne Center record for most points scored in a single game with 52, field goals made with 18, field goal attempts with 35, three-pointers made with 11, and three-point attempts with 21. In his senior season (2011–12), he averaged 17.1 points, 3.2 rebounds, 2 assists and 1.6 steals per game shooting 45.3 percent overall.

He had majored in general studies during his time there.\nProfessional career.\nOverseas career.\nIn August 2012, James signed with Zagreb of Croatia for the 2012–13 season. In December 2012, he left Zagreb. \nIn July 2013, James signed with Paffoni Omegna of Italy under their DNA Silver Basket league name for the 2013–14 season. That season, they finished in fourth place for the DNA Silver portion of the league.\nIn August 2014, James signed a one-year contract with Kolossos Rodou of Greece. On December 2, 2014, he left Kolossos and signed with the Spanish club Laboral Kutxa Baskonia of the Liga ACB for the rest of the season.\nIn July 2015, James joined the Phoenix Suns for the 2015 NBA Summer League. That same month, after a successful Summer League performance, he re-signed with Baskonia for one more season. During that season, Saski Baskonia would reach the EuroLeague Final Four, losing to the Fenerbahçe Ülker and the PBC Lokomotiv Kuban for a fourth-place performance.\nOn July 3, 2016, James signed with Panathinaikos in Greece for the 2016–17 season. That year saw him perform his best work in the EuroLeague yet. He helped the Panathinaikos win both the Greek Cup title and the Greek Basket League championship in the 2016–17 season. He was later named the Greek Basket League's Most Spectacular Player that year as well.\nPhoenix Suns (2017).\nOn July 3, 2017, James signed with the Phoenix Suns and joined the team for the 2017 NBA Summer League. In the 2017 Summer League, he led the team in points and assists, averaging 20.5 points off of 53.8% shooting and 5.0 assists per game, as well as recording 5.2 rebounds and 1.8 steals in 33.2 minutes per game for the six games the Suns played during the event. James's contract with the team was a two-way affiliate deal, their first in franchise history. He also became the first player to sign a two-way contract in the NBA after spending multiple years overseas in international leagues. While James was eligible to split his time between Phoenix and their Northern Arizona Suns G League affiliate, he never joined the G League team during his two-way contract. James made his NBA debut on October 18, 2017, against the Portland Trail Blazers, recording 12 points that night.

During his first four games of the season, James recorded at least 10 or more points with increased minute production in each game.

James would play his last game under his original two-way contract on December 5 against the Toronto Raptors, recording 10 points in a 126–113 loss. During this time, James would be considered the biggest success story to date revolving around the NBA's newest implemented system.\nOn December 7, 2017, James's contract with the Suns was converted to a one-year regular season deal, after Phoenix waived Derrick Jones Jr. However, on December 23, 2017, over two weeks after signing his one-year deal, James was waived by the Suns.\nNew Orleans Pelicans (2018).\nOn January 14, 2018, the New Orleans Pelicans signed James to a new two-way contract.

He won the Alphonso Ford Trophy, given to the top scorer of the EuroLeague.\nBut despite the statistically excellent season, the incoming Olimpia Milano coach, Ettore Messina, declared Mike James wouldn't be part of the 2019–20 team plans. James and the Italian team eventually reached an agreement and mutually parted ways on July 29, 2019.\nCSKA Moscow (2019–2021).\nOn August 5, 2019, James signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow of the VTB United League and the EuroLeague. On June 1, 2020, he signed a three-year contract extension with CSKA. On April 21, 2021, he and CSKA came to an agreement that allowed the player to become a free agent until the end of the 2020–21 season. James averaged 19.3 points and 5.7 assists per game in the 2020–21 EuroLeague season. On September 11, 2021, James and the Russian club officially reached a buy-out agreement in order to terminate their mutual contract.\nBrooklyn Nets (2021).\nOn April 23, 2021, James signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets. On the same day of his signing, James debuted for the Nets against the Boston Celtics, logging eight points on 3-of-8 shooting from the field and 1-of-1 from three-point range to go along with two rebounds and two assists across 21 minutes in a 109–104 win. On May 3, James signed a second 10-day contract with the Nets. On May 13, James was signed for the rest of the 2020–21 season.\nMonaco (2021–present).\nOn September 17, 2021, James signed with AS Monaco Basket of the French LNB Pro A. On July 14, 2022, James signed a two-year contract extension with Monaco.\nOn March 14, 2023, Monaco temporarily suspended James for an internal violation of team rules. After this episode, he went on to lead the team to the 2023 EuroLeague Final Four, the first ever appearance of the club in the Final Four. He scored 17 points in Monaco's loss in semi-finals. \nOn October 26, 2023, after scoring 24 points against Maccabi Tel Aviv, James became the fastest player in EuroLeague history to reach 4,000 career points, doing so in 248 games.\nJames was named to the LNB All-Star Game in the 2023–24 season, and on December 31, led Team World to a victory over Team France. He scored 34 points and was named the All-Star Game MVP.\nOn March 7, 2024, Mike James became the EuroLeague's all-time leading scorer during a regular season game against Red Star Belgrade. He surpassed Vassilis Spanoulis after having scored 4,464 points after the game. \nThe Basketball Tournament.\nJames has played for Team Maryland and Team Hines in The Basketball Tournament (TBT), an annual single-elimination winner-take-all tournament on ESPN. In two games with Team Maryland in TBT 2016, Mike James averaged 28.5 points, 4.0 assists and 6.5 rebounds per game. James's most impressive outing was a 35-point, seven-rebound outburst in a 104–92 loss against Team Foe. Three years later in TBT 2019, James led Team Hines to the Semifinal Round in which they lost to the Golden Eagles, 68–62. In five games, James averaged 16.4 points and 5.4 assists per game, while shooting 36.8 percent from the field.\nControversial comment.\nIn early August 2022, James received media attention after making critical comments about NBA star Stephen Curry. James referred to Curry as being \"one-dimensional\" and negatively compared Curry to other NBA stars such as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Joel Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Dončić. Curry himself later jokingly referred to the \"one-dimensional\" jab from James while talking with the media at a basketball camp he was hosting for elite high school players."

The majority of boxing in India occurs nationally and internationally as amateur boxing, with only a few boxers opting to pursue professional boxing.

Boxing has been rising in popularity in certain states, particularly in Haryana. The Bhiwani Boxing Club in Bhiwani, Haryana has produced medalists in various weight classes.\nNotable boxers and boxing victories.\nIndia's Mary Kom is a six-time World Amateur Boxing champion, and the only woman boxer to have won a medal in each one of the six world championships.

With this attempt she became the fifth gymnast to ever execute the Produnova, just after legendary gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, who executed it multiples times. In October 2015, Karmakar became the first Indian gymnast to qualify for a final stage at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. Later in 2016 when she qualified for Rio Olympics, she became the first Indian gymnast to do so and also hours after her qualification at 2016 Gymnastics Olympic Test Event she clinched a gold medal in the Women's vault event stunning Oksana Chusovitina with her Prudunova again who came second to her. On 6 July 2016, FIG honored Dipa by naming her World Class Gymnast. At Rio Olympics, she achieved 4th place in vaults. After a long break due to injury when she ran for vaults and landed with a gold at World Challenge Cup series. Her medal is one of the first medals won by any Indian at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup, second only to Aruna Reddy's bronze for individual vaults at FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Melbourne."

        "title": "2012 Giro d'Italia, Stage 1 to Stage 11",
        "text": "The 2012 Giro d'Italia began on 5 May, and stage 11 occurred on 16 May. The 2012 edition began with an individual time trial stage – where each member of the starting peloton of 198 riders competed against the clock – in Herning, Denmark with two more stages held in the country before an early rest day. The riders then travelled by air to Italy, with the race resuming in Verona and a team time trial, an event where each member of a team started together racing against the clock.\nTaylor Phinney held the lead of the race throughout its opening Danish leg; having won the race-commencing individual time trial, Phinney defended it on the following two stages, despite crashing in the closing stages of the third stage after being involved in a multi-rider incident. Phinney crossed the line in an ambulance, receiving medical attention before making his way onto the rostrum. The incident itself was started by Roberto Ferrari clipping Mark Cavendish – the winner of the second stage – causing Cavendish to fall and the rest of the field to stack up behind. Race organisers saw fit to demote Ferrari on the stage results, penalise him on both time – 30 seconds penalty on the general classification – and a 25-point deduction, while he was fined also. Ferrari was remorseful at the time of the crash, but later apologised to Cavendish and other riders involved.\nUpon the race's return to Italy, won the fourth stage, the team time trial in Verona. Alex Rasmussen had been placed third after the Danish leg, but he was dropped during the stage and thus it was Ramūnas Navardauskas who picked up the \"maglia rosa\" from Phinney, becoming the first rider from Lithuania to wear the leader's jersey at the Giro. Navardauskas held on to the jersey for another day, before Adriano Malori assumed the lead of the race at the end of stage six. Malori had been a part of the breakaway on that stage, before Miguel Ángel Rubiano soloed to victory on the day. The jersey changed hands again the following day, as Malori cracked during the seventh stage, with Ryder Hesjedal coming through to become the first Canadian to wear the pink jersey. He held the jersey for three days, before handing it over to Joaquim Rodríguez, who took the jersey with a win on the tenth stage, a steep finish into Assisi. Rodríguez held on to the jersey the next day, topping the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Giro still to race.\nStage 1.\nThe race commenced with a short individual time trial stage, much like it had done on the Giro's previous start in a foreign country – the start in Herning was the tenth time that the race had started outside of Italy, and the furthest north geographically – when the race began with an individual time trial of held in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 2010. The stage in Herning itself, in length, was relatively flat, dropping only in altitude from the start, to the end. Despite this, it was considered technical due to the nature of the parcours, with several tight ninety-degree turns and cobblestones on several sections of the course before the finish at \"H. P. Hansensvej\". Jackson Rodríguez () was the first rider to depart the start house in Herning, recording a time of 11' 58\" for the course, a time that was eventually only good enough for the bottom ten places overall.\nIndeed, Rodríguez's lead was short-lived as Marco Bandiera (), 's Jonas Aaen Jørgensen and rider Bernhard Eisel all assumed the top spot as they reached the finish, with Robert Hunter of recording the first time under eleven minutes, as he set a time of 10' 54\". Hunter's time held to the next group of riders and it was his team-mate Ramūnas Navardauskas that took the lead; Navardauskas recorded a time some six seconds faster, and was good enough to hold off the rest of the field for over two hours. Navardauskas' time was given a few close calls; 's Jesse Sergent went quicker at the start of the stage – four seconds ahead of Navardauskas to the mid-stage intermediate point – but ultimately faded to two seconds outside of the Lithuanian rider's time. A while later, Brett Lancaster went even closer to the time of Navardauskas for the newly renamed team; he was quicker to the intermediate point than what Sergent had been, but fell outside the time by just one second at the stage finish, having encountered his minute-man Andrey Zeits () in the closing stages.\nNavardauskas' stay at the head of the stage classification was eventually ended by 's Manuele Boaro, who had placed in the top ten in individual time trials of both Tirreno–Adriatico and the Tour de Romandie, having set the quickest time to the intermediate point and eventually continued the pace to the end of the stage, recording a time of 10' 41\". Geraint Thomas was next to the line for , and went six seconds below the time of Boaro, but both were eventually eclipsed by 's Taylor Phinney, the 2010 world under-23 time trial champion. Thomas had held the advantage at midpoint by one second, but an impressive second half of the course turned a deficit into an eventual stage-winning margin of nine seconds. Thus Phinney, who later stated that it had been a dream to win the jersey, became only the third American rider to wear the leader's \"maglia rosa\" after Andrew Hampsten in 1988 and Christian Vande Velde in 2008. Phinney and Thomas were safe from further challenges, but Alex Rasmussen () and 's Gustav Larsson both broke into the top five later on, recording times of 10' 39\" and 10' 48\" respectively. Further back, 's Roman Kreuziger recorded the best time of the overall contenders, with a time of 11' 02\" good enough for 28th position in the stage results. Ivan Basso () and Joaquim Rodríguez () set times within ten seconds of Kreuziger in their disadvantageous discipline; although they both gained a 20-second advantage over pair Damiano Cunego and Michele Scarponi.\nStage 1 result and general classification after stage 1\nStage 2.\nThree riders – 's Alfredo Balloni, Olivier Kaisen of , and rider Miguel Ángel Rubiano – advanced clear of the main field in the early running of the stage; the quartet managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of over thirteen minutes around a quarter of the way through the stage. With all the riders close together time-wise following the opening stage, and were mainstays at the front of the peloton, trying to chip away at the advantage of the breakaway throughout the twisting Danish roads alongside the coast. were also prominent towards the front of the main pack, as they looked to protect their main sprinter Matthew Goss. In the breakaway, Balloni guaranteed himself as the recipient of the first \"maglia azzurra\" of the race, as he crested the day's only categorised climb in Østerbjerg first, ahead of Rubiano and Kaisen.\nThe lead advantage at this point – with around remaining – had been cut to less than half of what it had been before; 's pace on the front allowed the gap to fall to just over five minutes on the route. With other teams coming towards the front of the main pack, namely and , the advantage that the trio out front held, continued to dwindle. It was inevitable that the trio would be caught, and sure enough, just shy of the to go banner, the peloton absorbed the breakaway back into their midsts. Parity however was short-lived as an attacking move was launched by Kaisen's team-mate Lars Bak, the Danish rider giving home fans someone to cheer for; he was given space for a time by the main field, allowing to get clear by around 45 seconds as they reached the remaining mark. He stayed off the front for a time longer, and was caught with around to go; and having done most of the legwork to bring him back, after the other teams had only brought Bak back marginally.\nThe riders remained together as they entered Herning for the final finishing loop of in and around the city, with no riders being allowed any initiative to get a gap on the field, and thus limiting the chances of somebody getting clear in the closing stages. The lap had been passing without drama, until race leader Taylor Phinney () crashed a third of the way around the lap. Once he got back onto his feet, Phinney suffered the misfortune of dropping his chain and lost over 30 seconds trying to fix the issue, but with help from his team-mates, including Danilo Wyss and Alessandro Ballan, he managed to bridge back up to the main pack ahead of the finish. At the front, were starting to set up their leadout train for Tyler Farrar while had hoped to get Andrea Guardini, the six-stage winner at the Tour de Langkawi earlier in the season, in position for the sprint. As the field rounded the final corner, 's Theo Bos lost control – having clipped the wheel of team-mate Mark Renshaw – and crashed into Alexander Kristoff (), and caused a stack-up which reduced the number of contenders for the stage win; 's train was still in position at the front, but Geraint Thomas delivered Mark Cavendish to the line for the incumbent world champion to claim his 31st Grand Tour stage win on the line, ahead of Goss and 's Geoffrey Soupe. Phinney held the leader's jersey after finishing within the main field, while Cavendish took the lead of the points classification from Phinney.\nStage 3.\nThe third stage of the race was dedicated to Belgian rider Wouter Weylandt – the winner of the third stage of the 2010 edition of the race into Middelburg, Netherlands – after he crashed while descending the \"Passo del Bocco\" during the third stage of the 2011 race, and died of his injuries in the crash. A short ceremony, including a minute's silence led by team members – Weylandt's former team – was held prior to the stage in Horsens. As well as Weylandt, the mayor of Horsens, Jan Trøjborg, was also commemorated during the ceremony. Trøjborg, who had been a prevalent figure in bringing the Giro to Denmark, died on 6 May after suffering a heart attack during an amateur bicycle ride in Jutland.\nSix riders made up the stage's breakaway, including sixth-placed Ramūnas Navardauskas (), but they could not gather more than three-and-a-half minutes of an advantage throughout the entire parcours, and were all caught by around remaining. As he had done the previous day, 's Lars Bak counter-attacked the peloton as they caught the leaders, but he was caught on the final lap of a finishing circuit in length, and thus setting up for an eventual bunch sprint to the finish line. and were towards the front although Geraint Thomas later sat up as Mark Cavendish was not directly behind him, and in effect leaving him without a lead-out man. brought their men forward inside the final kilometre; with Tomas Vaitkus and Brett Lancaster setting the pace for Matthew Goss, they moved to the head of the pack. Cavendish picked up the wheel of 's Tyler Farrar and they attacked down the outside of the road, moving forward at around remaining.\n rider Roberto Ferrari tried to move from the left side of the road to the right side of it, but as he aggressively switched lanes, he clipped Cavendish, sending the world champion to the ground and causing the whole field to stack up behind. Among other riders to fall were overall leader Taylor Phinney () and sprinter Sacha Modolo. In front of the chaos, Goss led out the sprint to take 's first Grand Tour win, and with the bonus seconds on offer at the finish, moved into the top ten overall, as well as taking the points classification lead from Cavendish; rider Juan José Haedo finished second ahead of Farrar. Ferrari, who had finished the stage ninth, was demoted to the end of the stage results, fined, and was penalised 30 seconds in the general classification and 25 points in the points classification; a decision that his team boss Gianni Savio had no qualms about, although Ferrari was remorseless when reflecting about his actions. Cavendish later tweeted that Ferrari should be \"ashamed to take out Pink, Red &amp; World Champ jerseys\", and also questioned the decision to keep Ferrari in the race.\nStage 4.\nFor the seventh successive year, the Giro's first stage on Italian soil was held as a time trial; on this occasion it was held in and around Verona, on a circuit. The circuit started at the Basilica di San Zeno, heading out towards the comune of San Pietro in Cariano, around outside of Verona before returning to Verona itself, finishing on the city's largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Much like individual time trial stages, each of the squads set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the teams general classification at the end of the previous stage, with the exception of – second in the standings – who started after the classification leaders , as Taylor Phinney held the lead of the race overall for . Thus, , who were bottom of the classification, trailing by two minutes and eighteen seconds, were the first team to set off on the stage. set a time of 38' 49\" for the course, with only – starting three minutes later – recording a slower time overall.\n knocked a second off the time of to take a short spell at the top of the timesheets, before comfortably bettered their time, by over a minute, with Italian national champion Adriano Malori helping to drive the pace on the front of the squad's train, with their overall contenders Michele Scarponi and Damiano Cunego in tow. Their time held until the ninth squad to start the stage, Joaquim Rodríguez's , took another half minute off the best time of , recording a time of 37' 09\", to aid with Rodríguez's placing in the general classification – moving into the top ten placings – overall. The team's time held until the second team from the end, went round the course five seconds quicker, for their second team time trial win of the year after a victory in the Tour of Qatar; the result, and the squad's teamwork, pleased sporting director Allan Peiper at the conclusion of the stage. Phinney's stay in the \"maglia rosa\" was ended, as finished the stage in a time 31 seconds outside that of ; assuming the lead of the race was Ramūnas Navardauskas, after the team's highest-placed rider prior to the stage, Alex Rasmussen, was dropped during the stage. Phinney later suggested that his crashes of previous days may have been a contributing factor in the loss of the leader's jersey.\nStage 5.\nFollowing the route of the Via Aemilia Roman road, Pierpaolo De Negri of instigated the breakaway of the day, and was joined shortly after by several other riders, with pairing Olivier Kaisen – who had been a part of the second stage breakaway – and Brian Bulgaç, and rider Alessandro De Marchi joining De Negri out front. The quartet quickly stepped up the pace to pull clear of the peloton, fronted by the team of race leader Ramūnas Navardauskas. After leaving Forlì, approaching the midpoint of the stage, the breakaway's lead was over six minutes. then set about reducing their advantage steadily, with proficient time-trial riders Alex Rasmussen and Sébastien Rosseler controlling the tempo on the front of the main field as they headed ever nearer the finish point; also had riders towards the front, in the hope of setting up their sprinter Arnaud Démare for the finish in Fano. then drove the pace of the peloton – reducing their advantage to 2' 30\" – as the leaders hit the foot of the day's only categorised climb, the fourth-category \"Gabicce Monte\" where De Negri led across the summit, and Kaisen was dropped on the climb. The main field had reduced their advantage to half of what it was at the bottom of the climb.\nDe Marchi attacked not long after the summit of the climb, maintaining a lead of around a minute ahead of the peloton now led by , who were looking to keep two-time Giro winner Ivan Basso out of trouble, unlike 's Taylor Phinney, who encountered a crash for the fourth stage in succession. De Negri and Bulgaç were pulled back by the main field not long after the climb, while De Marchi managed to hold off the front until around from the end. Within that distance, there were several mini-attacks by the likes of former Italian national champion Giovanni Visconti () and another rider, Adam Hansen, but it all came down to the final sprint for the line. The sprint itself came down to two teams; , the team of points classification leader Matthew Goss, and , with world champion – and Goss' former team-mate – Mark Cavendish looking to pick up his second win of the Giro. As he had done on stage 2, Geraint Thomas led Cavendish out for the sprint with around to go and despite Goss' best attempts, Cavendish prevailed ahead of Goss, while Daniele Bennati () beat out Robert Hunter () for third place. With a split in the peloton – resulting in a five-second gap – Hunter missed out on the \"maglia rosa\" by five seconds, and the jersey remained with Navardauskas. Goss and Cavendish – who was joined on the podium by his new-born daughter Delilah Grace – both moved into the top five overall with the bonus seconds on offer at the finish.\nStage 6.\nAfter only fourth-category climbs at best during the early stages of the race, the sixth stage saw the introduction of the higher categorised climbs, with three third-category climbs on the stage's parcours, as well as the second-category \"Passo della Cappella\" on gravel roads, all coming after the mark. Fifteen riders representing fourteen teams – only had more than one rider in the breakaway, with riders Gatis Smukulis and Aleksandr Kuschynski – contributed to the opening move of the stage, as they accelerated off the front of the main field inside the first of the stage. Of the fifteen, four riders were dropped very quickly after that, including mountains classification leader Alfredo Balloni (), with the best placed of the remaining eleven out front being 's Luke Roberts, who had been 25th prior to the stage. , who did not have a rider in the move out front, set about trying to bring the gap down to the main field, as the eleven riders held an advantage of close to nine minutes prior to the first climb of the day, the \"Cingoli\".\n's Michał Gołaś led over the climb, while Miguel Ángel Rubiano () attacked on all three of the remaining climbs, giving him enough points to replace Balloni as the leader of the mountains classification at stage's end. After sitting up on the first two climbs to allow his breakaway companions – sans one rider, 's Pablo Lastras, who abandoned after a crash with rider Jack Bauer – to rejoin, Rubiano did not wait at the top of the \"Montegranaro\" and accelerated away solo. Rubiano continued to extend his gap over the main field in the next few kilometres, extending his gap over his former breakaway companions to a maximum of a minute-and-a-half, while he had three minutes in hand over the peloton. As it transpired, Rubiano continued on to the stage victory, 70 seconds clear of a group of riders consisting of 's Adriano Malori, Gołaś, Alexsandr Dyachenko of the team, and Cesare Benedetti representing Grand Tour debutants . The field was led over the line 41 seconds later by rider Daryl Impey, but Malori gained sufficient time to become the new leader of the race overall, 15 seconds ahead of Gołaś. Rubiano moved into fourth place in the standings behind Ryder Hesjedal (), half a minute behind Malori.\nStage 7.\nThe race's first summit finish occurred during the seventh stage, with a second-category climb up to Rocca di Cambio, at an altitude of . Although there was only one other climb on the parcours – the \"Colle Galluccio\" – the stage was considered hilly, as the majority of the stage consisted of frequent hills and descents, and was run above except for the opening . The primary breakaway of the stage was formed early in the stage, when a wave of four riders went clear. Fumiyuki Beppu () was joined in the breakaway by 's Mirko Selvaggi as well as two riders representing UCI Professional Continental Teams; Reto Hollenstein for and rider Matteo Rabottini, with the quartet quickly gaining a substantial advantage over the main field, as they were over nine minutes clear after .\nThe peloton slowly closed the time down at first, but by the time that the four leaders had gone over the climb and then moved on to the intermediate sprint in L'Aquila, efforts from , and had brought the time gap down to just under two-and-a-half minutes. Rabottini then attacked his breakaway companions, soon breaking clear, while in the peloton, several mini-attacks were established, with rider Stefano Pirazzi being caught before making a second move while Valerio Agnoli tried to follow for . Pirazzi caught up to Rabottini, while 's José Herrada and Daniele Pietropolli () caught up to Agnoli, with Herrada later joining the front duo and 's Ivan Santaromita established an all-Italian chase group with Agnoli and Pietropolli. Several riders attacked on the climb, which in effect brought the main field up towards the leaders, with Rabottini being absorbed back after failing to hold on to the pace set by Herrada and Pirazzi.\nPirazzi tried to attack Herrada on several occasions within the final of the stage, but he could not establish a big enough gap to get clear. Pirazzi then wasted his chance of a stage victory by making a mistake on a right-hand corner with around ; he overshot the corner and this gave Herrada a chance to extend his lead, but the peloton were closing all the time. In the end, Herrada was ultimately caught with to go where, on the steepest bit of the climb, with a gradient of 10% in places. held station at the front of the peloton, with Przemysław Niemiec protecting Michele Scarponi, before Scarponi made an attack on the climb, with 's Paolo Tiralongo going with him; Scarponi held the lead until the final corner, when Tiralongo came around the outside of him, to take his second Giro stage victory. With Scarponi's team-mate Adriano Malori dropping off the back of the peloton at the foot of the climb, Ryder Hesjedal – fifth on the stage, five seconds behind Tiralongo – assumed the lead of the race, to become the first Canadian rider to wear the leader's pink jersey. Fifteen seconds behind, Tiralongo moved into second place ahead of 's Joaquim Rodríguez.\nStage 8.\nFor the third successive day, the riders contended with a stage that was designated as a medium-mountain stage, with the race reaching its most southerly point by the finish in Laceno. Again, only two categorised climbs were scheduled; the fourth-category \"Valico di Macerone\" climb was contested at the mark, before descending down and ramping up towards the finish, with the day's other climb – the \"Colle Molella\" – coming just prior to the finish. The primary breakaway of the stage was formed early in the stage, when a wave of four riders – 's Andrey Amador, Julien Bérard of , rider Tomasz Marczyński and Miguel Mínguez () – went clear after of the day's running. By the midpoint of the stage, the lead quartet held a lead of over eleven minutes after the peloton elected not to chase them down at first.\nAmador and Marczyński went clear of their companions, after their advantage had been reduced to four minutes by the time of the intermediate sprint with around to go in San Giorgio del Sannio. With , and driving the pace on the front of the peloton, the advantage that Amador and Marczyński was reduced steadily, and they were caught with remaining. 's pace, mainly driven by Amstel Gold Race winner Enrico Gasparotto put numerous riders in trouble, including stage six winner Miguel Ángel Rubiano (), but after Gasparotto pulled off, it was left to and to set the tempo on the \"Colle Molella\". At to go, Giro del Trentino winner Domenico Pozzovivo attacked, and quickly gained a 30-second gap before any movement was made in the peloton, when Beñat Intxausti () attempted to follow him; he could not catch him, as Pozzovivo held on to win his first Giro stage by 23 seconds. Intxausti managed to hold on to second place, with a small group being led home by third-placed Joaquim Rodríguez of , four seconds further back. Ryder Hesjedal maintained the \"maglia rosa\", with Rodríguez moving ahead of Paolo Tiralongo into second place – nine seconds behind Hesjedal – while Intxausti and Pozzovivo moved into fifth and thirteenth in the overall classification respectively.\nStage 9.\nWith no categorised climbs on the parcours, the stage – although undulating – was widely expected to be a battle between the sprinters in Frosinone, with the top two riders in the points classification, 's Mark Cavendish and 's Matthew Goss widely tipped for stage honours, with Mark Renshaw () also looking to usurp his former team-mates for a first World Tour win. rider Brian Bulgaç made it into the breakaway for the second time in five stages, and was joined at the head of the race by Martijn Keizer of the team, and 's Pierre Cazaux. The breakaway trio's maximum advantage over the main field came around an hour into the stage, with the gap breaching the four-minute mark, but with none of the three riders in any contention to challenge overall leader Ryder Hesjedal (), the teams of the general classification contenders allowed them to hang off the front. With on the front of the peloton, the advantage started to dwindle and with remaining in the stage, their lead was under a minute. Keizer left his two rivals behind and began a solo escape in the hope of staying clear of the peloton all the way to Frosinone.\nHis hopes were ended halfway towards the finish, as he was caught with around to go. The small hills just outside Frosinone saw several mini-attacks; pair Dennis Vanendert and Gaëtan Bille, Matteo Rabottini () and Sonny Colbrelli () were the first quartet to make moves, but it set up Joaquim Rodríguez, second in the overall classification for , to have a go himself. With help from team-mate Ángel Vicioso, Rodríguez tried to break clear but was promptly recaptured by the main field. Several other mini-attacks occurred on the run-in to the finish, but the field was together as they approached a left-hand turn with to go. Contact between Goss and 's Filippo Pozzato sent both riders to the tarmac, with other riders, including Cavendish, being forced down as well. Pozzato blamed Goss for the crash, while sporting director Matt White directed the blame at Pozzato. With a reduced number of sprinters for the finish, rider Giacomo Nizzolo was best placed for the sprint, but a quick-closing Francisco Ventoso of the wrested the stage win away from Nizzolo, his second career Giro stage victory. Ventoso was followed over the line by 's Fabio Felline, Nizzolo and 's Damiano Caruso, the young rider classification leader. Hesjedal was also in the top ten of the stage results, and maintained his overall lead, having covered off Rodríguez's late-stage attack.\nStage 10.\nAlthough race organisers characterised the stage as \"medium-mountain\", only one climb was categorised on the parcours, with that being the hilltop finish in Assisi. The climb was in two parts, peaking at 15% in places on the first ascent, and after a slight descent, an average gradient of 8.5% for the final with elements of the climb being held on pavé. 's Joaquim Rodríguez – second place overnight, nine seconds behind leader Ryder Hesjedal () – was the favourite for the stage, having won numerous races on similarly steep finishes in the previous twelve months, including two stage victories at the 2011 Vuelta a España and a win at April's La Flèche Wallonne.\nAfter several, yet unsuccessful, mini-attacks in the opening few kilometres of the stage, a breakaway move of riders was established; consisting of rider Martijn Keizer – for the second day running – with 's Miguel Mínguez also making it out front for the second time during the race. They were joined by rider Guillaume Bonnafond, Matthias Brändle of and 's Francesco Failli, and this quintet went clear after . The group managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of almost five minutes after ; with Bonnafond being best placed of the five riders in the overall classification, trailing Hesjedal by almost 24 minutes, and protected their respective highest-placed riders by staying towards the front of the peloton. Failli attempted to drop his breakaway companions with around to go, but in the process destabilised Keizer and Brändle from the group; 's Stef Clement later caught those two riders after accelerating off the front of the pack.\nWith added assistance from Clement, the trio later rejoined Bonnafond, Mínguez and Failli at the head of the race, and held a lead over the peloton, led by Hesjedal's squad, of around a minute; their strong pace at the front managed to bring the gap down to about twenty seconds with remaining. The leaders were caught later, with several teams moving forward to be in a prime position for the climb up to Assisi. Tomas Vaitkus () and Tom-Jelte Slagter () tried to go clear on the lower stages of the climb, but it was not until 's John Gadret and rider Rigoberto Urán hit the front that the main group of riders started to accelerate. Daniel Moreno led the group, protecting Rodríguez but as he stepped aside, it was Paolo Tiralongo that led the move for . Slagter then tried to go clear once again, with only Rodríguez and 's Bartosz Huzarski following closely; Rodríguez left his sprint until to go, but was sufficient to take the stage victory – his first Giro win, meaning that he had won a stage in all three Grand Tours – and with bonus seconds on the line, the leader's pink jersey for the first time in his career. Huzarski was second, with Slagter fading to seventh behind Hesjedal.\nStage 11.\nThe midway point of the race was marked by the longest stage of the entire itinerary; a long stage ideally suited for the sprinters, despite a late-race climb of \"Vico\", with around to go before the finish in Montecatini Terme. Inside the opening of the stage, six riders – 's Adrián Sáez, rider Mickaël Delage, Olivier Kaisen (), Manuele Boaro of , rider Stefan Denifl and Simone Ponzi of – advanced clear of the main field, and they managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of almost five minutes. The peloton was keeping the gap in check however, despite Denifl – the best-placed of the sextet – trailing overnight leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by almost 42 minutes.\nWith , and doing the majority of the work on the front of the peloton, the gap that the breakaway held fluctuated between two and four minutes; at the summit of the stage's first of two climbs, the \"Poggio alla Croce\" after , the gap that the breakaway – now minus Ponzi, who had fallen back to the peloton after the first hour's racing – held was just two minutes. The time gap reduced steadily after that, with around to go, the gap was just a number of seconds. At this point, Boaro – a proficient time trial rider, having been national champion as a junior, and finished runner-up to Adriano Malori in the 2011 Italian championships – attacked his breakaway companions. Boaro managed to hold out off the front until the final finishing circuit, in length, with the leading the way.\nA mini-attack occurred on the climb at \"Vico\", but it was pulled back quickly after; in effect, guaranteeing a bunch sprint. tried to set up the finish for Mark Cavendish, but a miscue on the final corner by leadout men Peter Kennaugh and Geraint Thomas hampered the world champion, allowing Tomas Vaitkus () and 's Roberto Ferrari to get through and contest the finish. Behind that, 's sprinter Sacha Modolo hit the tarmac for the second time during the race, having been involved in the stage 3 incident. Ferrari finished stronger, and beat out his chasers for his first Giro win, with rider Francesco Chicchi outdragging Vaitkus for second. Cavendish finished an unhappy fourth, but did take the points classification lead from Vaitkus' team-mate Matthew Goss. There were no other changes to the jersey holders, with Rodríguez holding the overall lead into the second half of the race.\n\"For further results, see 2012 Giro d'Italia, Stage 12 to Stage 21\""

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2012 Giro d'Italia was contested on 17 May, and the race concluded with Stage 21 on 27 May. The second half of the race was situated entirely within Italy; starting with a medium mountain stage from Seravezza to Sestri Levante, before the customary race-concluding time trial was held in Milan.\nFollowing his victory in the tenth stage, 's Joaquim Rodríguez held the lead into the second half of the race. He maintained his lead on stage 12 – after the breakaway succeeded in staying away until the end of the stage as rider Lars Bak held on to win by eleven seconds ahead of the remnants of the breakaway group – and on stage 13, as Mark Cavendish picked up his third stage victory of the race on one of the few sprinter-suited stages during the second half of the race. Rodríguez gave up the lead of the race at the end of stage 14, after rider Ryder Hesjedal attacked on the climb to the stage finish at Cervinia – the first that the climb had featured in the Giro since 1997 – taking 26 seconds out of his rival, and reclaimed the \"maglia rosa\" that he held for three days in the first half of the race.\nRodríguez immediately retook the lead of the race the following day at the summit finish at the \"\". Although he finished second to rider Matteo Rabottini on the day, Rodríguez gained 39 seconds on Hesjedal through his late-stage attack. After the race's second rest day which came after that stage, the gap between Rodríguez and Hesjedal remained at the half-minute mark for the next three stages; the breakaway succeeded once again on stage 16 as rider Jon Izagirre soloed away from a group of riders in the closing stages, while on stage 17, Rodríguez won the stage after a group of the leading overall contenders escaped on the \"Passo Giau\". Also among that group were Hesjedal, former winners Ivan Basso () and Michele Scarponi (), with rider Rigoberto Urán and 's Domenico Pozzovivo making up the sextet. Stage 18 saw the sprinters' last chance of victory with Andrea Guardini of edging out Cavendish for victory.\nHesjedal and Rodríguez took near-identical gaps out on one another during stages 19 and 20; Hesjedal reduced the lead to 17 seconds in the former stage finishing at the \"\", while Rodríguez moved it back out to 31 seconds following the Cima Coppi finish at the Stelvio Pass. rider Thomas De Gendt moved into overall podium contention by winning the stage to the Stelvio, taking between three and five minutes from all of the other overall contenders, and moved from ninth place to fourth place at the end of the stage. Hesjedal's better time trial abilities enabled him to take the lead of the race on the final day from Rodríguez; he overturned the 31-second deficit, and ultimately became the first Canadian rider to win a Grand Tour. Hesjedal had turned the deficit into a 16-second margin of victory, the closest such margin since Eddy Merckx beat Gianbattista Baronchelli by 12 seconds in the 1974 edition of the race. De Gendt moved ahead of Scarponi for third place, to become the first Belgian rider to finish on a Grand Tour podium since Johan Bruyneel finished third at the 1995 Vuelta a España.\nStage 12.\nThe stage had been scheduled to be held over a distance of , but in April 2012, prior to the start of the Giro, the itinerary was changed slightly to . Due to torrential rains which caused floods and mudslides in October 2011, the roads through the Cinque Terre were considered unusable for the race. As such, the second half of the race began with an undulating stage along the Ligurian coast, with four categorised climbs over the parcours, the last of which coming just from the stage finish in Sestri Levante. Mini-attacks set the course for the stage as the field remained as one, for much of the first hour of racing; it was not until after that the stage's primary breakaway had been formed. An initial move of seven riders representing seven different teams went clear, with the septet later joined by two more riders, Jackson Rodríguez () and 's Martijn Keizer, the latter again making it into the breakaway move.\n's Sandy Casar was the best-placed of the nine riders in the group, trailing overnight leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by four minutes, and as the stage wore on, became more of a threat to Rodríguez's lead. The breakaway's gap surpassed that figure, reaching a high of seven minutes, with remaining on the stage. As set the pace on the front of the peloton, rider Michał Gołaś soloed off the front of the lead group, but he was caught prior to the summit of the day's final climb, the \"Villa Tassani\". More attacks occurred between the leaders prior to the finish, but Lars Bak produced the decisive attack with remaining, and eventually went clear to an 11-second winning margin at the finish, winning his first individual Giro stage. Casar led a group of six riders across in second, but his time gap to the peloton was only 3' 23\". Despite the twelve bonus seconds on offer for second at the line, Casar was still 26 seconds shy of taking the race lead, but moved into third in the general classification, behind Rodríguez and 's Ryder Hesjedal.\nStage 13.\nAt , stage 13 was the shortest non-time trial stage of the entire Giro; again, the stage was undulating, with only one categorised climb at Montezemolo, into the itinerary. The stage was ideally set for the sprinters, potentially their last possible attempt to win a stage, with the final week of the Giro set to be all about the climbers and overall contenders for the race. The primary breakaway of the stage was formed early in the stage, when rider Martijn Keizer and 's Francesco Failli went clear in the opening stages of the day's running. By the point of the stage, the lead duo held their maximum lead of the day, when they were five-and-a-half minutes, after the peloton – led by and – elected to ease their pace.\nThe peloton steadily closed down the lead duo after that climb, and with around to go in the stage, Keizer and Failli were absorbed by the main pack. Once they were all together, the pace slowed again as many teams tried to get their protected riders into a safe enough position prior to the finish in Cervere. Having slowed the pace before, were on the front again, hoping to set up the sprint for their sprinter, Arnaud Démare; they were later joined on the front by the and teams, both of whom were looking to set up their respective Australian sprinters Mark Renshaw and Matthew Goss. Inside the final , three riders – Julien Bérard of , 's Julien Vermote and rider Fabio Felline tried to advance clear to alleviate an expected bunch sprint, but the sprint trains of and managed to close them down. Brett Lancaster launched Goss into his sprint, with Mark Cavendish () on his wheel. Cavendish tried to come down the left of Goss in the closing metres, but Goss closed the gap and Cavendish had to drop his pace, but recovered effortlessly and took Goss, and held on to win his third stage of the Giro. His 33rd Grand Tour stage win, Cavendish also extended his lead in the points classification, as Goss could only finish sixth behind 's Alexander Kristoff, Renshaw, rider Sacha Modolo and Elia Favilli of . Goss left the race following the stage, further extending Cavendish's lead.\nStage 14.\nThe first categorised mountain stage of the race featured a near-flat opening to the stage, before almost worth of climbing in the remainder of the stage, with two first-category climbs, the \"Col de Joux\" – climbing up to an altitude of – and the finishing climb to Cervinia, reaching up to a height of via an average gradient of 5.5% over the . The climb to Cervinia was being used in the race for the first time since 1997, when eventual race winner Ivan Gotti took the race lead from Pavel Tonkov, and never relinquished the lead to the end of it. Prior to the stage, a minute's silence was held as a mark of respect to victims of a bombing at a school in Brindisi, earlier in the day.\nWith the stage parcours as such, there were no major movements off the race for the first hour of racing, before the weather conditions changed; rain would play in the rest of the day's proceedings. Eight riders went clear at around the mark, building up a lead of in excess of thirteen minutes over the main field. Three of the eight were dropped on the lower parts of the \"Col de Joux\", while set the pace on the front of the field, reducing their advantage to around ten-and-a-half minutes. 's Jan Bárta had gone clear, while José Rujano () had linked up with rider Damiano Cunego to try and chase him. They could not do so, and instead it was left to Andrey Amador of the to foot the chase to Bárta. He caught him and eventually proceeded to drop him on the descent, and held a half-minute lead by the time he had reached the final climb to Cervinia. He extended the lead on the lower slopes of the climb itself, and soon held an advantage of over a minute over Rujano's team-mate Alessandro De Marchi, 's Matteo Montaguti, Bárta and 's Pierpaolo De Negri.\nDe Marchi and Bárta both later made solo attacks out of the group, and eventually caught up to Amador as the peloton grew ever-closer on the parcours. The peloton had been around five minutes behind with remaining, but the gap had been halved by the time they had reached the to go mark. De Marchi tried to break his two companions but could not do so; while in the peloton, there were several movements but it was not until Ryder Hesjedal got clear for that there was more animation in the peloton. Joaquim Rodríguez tried to follow his rival but was ultimately unsuccessful. At the front however, it was down to the three leaders for the sprint; Bárta tried to launch his sprint first, but fell short at the line as Amador achieved the first stage victory for a Costa Rican rider in any Grand Tour. De Marchi finished a couple of seconds behind in third, while Hesjedal gapped the Rodríguez group by 26 seconds to retake the \"maglia rosa\". Hesjedal later stated that his attack on the climb was \"unplanned\", and that he was confident of taking the race victory in Milan.\nStage 15.\nJust like the previous day's stage, the first element of the stage was largely flat, before approaching the first of four categorised climbs, the \"\". After the descent from the climb and another uncategorised climb immediately after, the riders took in the third-category \"Forcella di Bura\" before two second category climbs; the \"Culmine di San Pietro\" with its summit at remaining, as well as the final climb of the \"Pian dei Resinelli\". Heavy rain again dominated the roads, with fog in places, making conditions treacherous for any major attacks. The breakaway was instigated by a pair of riders at the mark, when rider Guillaume Bonnafond and 's Matteo Rabottini were allowed to get clear. Bonnafond and Rabottini soon garnered a gap of around nine minutes some later, but the pair reached the footslopes of the \"Valico di Valcava\" with an eight-minute lead.\nAt the same time as seven riders making their break from the -led peloton, Rabottini soon left Bonnafond on the climb, beginning a solo attack of the parcours. Five riders also bridged up to the chase group, making it a dozen riders chasing after Rabottini on the road. Rabottini crossed the summit almost five minutes clear of the chasers, with the peloton several minutes further behind. and continued to set the pace on the front of the main group, looking to bring Ryder Hesjedal and Ivan Basso back into the equation for the overall classification. Rabottini suffered a crash inside the final of the stage, but still held an advantage of over two minutes to the chase group. took their turn on the front of the peloton, with numbers reducing in the \"gruppetto\" down to around twenty riders.\nRabottini took a lead of two-and-a-half minutes into the final of the stage, but Stefano Pirazzi launched an attack from the chase group for ; his second such attack of the stage, having attacked on the \"Culmine di San Pietro\", before he was closed down by other riders. With Damiano Cunego () and Amets Txurruka () marking each other in the small group, 's Alberto Losada counter-attacked, and Cunego could not follow his move as Txurruka joined Losada. Losada went clear of Txurruka and Pirazzi and set off after Rabottini, while in the group of overall contenders, Cunego's team-mate Michele Scarponi attacked with only Basso, 's Sergio Henao and Joaquim Rodríguez () for company. Rodríguez accelerated further, catching and passing Pirazzi and Txurruka, while team-mate Losada waited for him to help his team-mate on the climb; he carried on without Losada, catching Rabottini inside the final . Rabottini latched on to Rodríguez, and took him on the outside of the final left-hand turn and beat him to the line for his first victory since the 2011 Tour of Turkey. Rodríguez reclaimed the \"maglia rosa\" from Hesjedal, while fourth-placed Henao claimed the young rider classification lead from team-mate Rigoberto Urán.\nStage 16.\nFollowing the second and final rest day of the race the previous day, the race returned with a stage classified \"medium-mountain\" without any categorised climbs over the parcours. Despite this, the stage gradually rose during its course, before reaching the highest point at the finish – via a closing climb with a gradient reaching 12% in places, yet uncategorised – in Pfalzen, above sea level. After a previous thirteen-rider breakaway move had earlier been unsuccessful, a second batch of ten riders launched their attack on the peloton after around , but none of the riders posed a threat to overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez (); the best-placed rider of the group was 's José Herrada, who was over 32 minutes behind Rodríguez at the start of the stage.\nWith such an advantage over their rivals in the lead group, the peloton elected not to chase them down at any point, and as such, the gap to them moved up to an unassailable advantage of almost 13 minutes with under remaining in the stage. While the main field managed to marginally cut into the lead that the breakaway had held, inside the final , with upping the tempo to allow their jersey-wearers Mark Cavendish (points) and Sergio Henao (young rider) to stay out of the way of any potential hazards in the closing stages. At the front, 's Mathias Frank chased down moves by Herrada, rider Alessandro De Marchi and Jon Izagirre of , but Izagirre managed to break the confines of the group with around to go. Izagirre was not caught, eventually soloing away to a 16-second victory for his first Grand Tour win, and second in a month after a previous victory in the time trial of April's Vuelta a Asturias. De Marchi beat Stef Clement () for second place, while the peloton trimmed the gap to the breakaway to under nine minutes at the finish, following injections of pace from and .\nStage 17.\nFollowing the previous day's summit finish in Pfalzen, the race continued in the Dolomites with four high-mountain passes over the parcours, culminating in the first-category \"Giau Pass\", the highest point of the previous year's race. The \"Passo Giau\", a climb reaching up to an altitude of – an average gradient of 9.3% – was set to break up the peloton prior to the near- descent into Cortina d'Ampezzo; where the race was being hosted by the town for the first time since 1977. With much of the focus upon those closing climbs – three inside the final of the stage – with the \"Passo Duran\" and the \"Forcella Staulanza\" coming before the \"Passo Giau\", there was no immediate breakaway from the start.\nInstead, it was not until the end of the first hour of racing that the breakaway had been instigated. Five riders broke the confines of the peloton at the mark, consisting of mountains classification leader Matteo Rabottini (), José Serpa of , rider Kevin Seeldraeyers as well as 's Branislau Samoilau and Matteo Montaguti representing the team. The quintet held a lead of almost six minutes on the stage's first climb, the \"Passo Valparola\", but their advantage was cut by the time Rabottini had extended his mountains points lead, by cresting the summit first. and were the prominent teams on the front of the field, with rider Mikel Nieve eventually attacking off the front, replacing Montaguti as the fifth member of the breakaway, as he had been dropped. All five were later caught before the \"Passo Giau\", where the squad were again leading the reduced peloton. As was expected, the \"Passo Giau\" defined the remainder of the stage.\nWith three riders setting the pace for their team captain Ivan Basso, numerous riders were being dislodged from the back of the group; as such, only six riders remained with the group halfway up the climb, with Basso being joined by overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez (), 's Ryder Hesjedal, rider Michele Scarponi, as well as Rigoberto Urán of – after team-mate Sergio Henao had been dropped – and rider Domenico Pozzovivo. Scarponi and Urán were both dropped in the closing stages of the \"Passo Giau\", but they both made it back into the lead group on the descent into Cortina d'Ampezzo; the sextet battled it out for the stage honours in a sprint finish, where Rodríguez came from last position in the line to out-sprint his rivals for his second stage win of the race. His overall lead remained at 30 seconds however, as there was no bonus seconds on offer at the finish; but he also stated that Hesjedal was the favourite, due to his superior abilities in the time trial. Rodríguez also dedicated his stage victory to Xavier Tondo, on the first anniversary of his death while preparing for a training session. The only jersey to change hands at the end of the stage was Urán, moving into fifth place overall, taking the young rider classification lead from team-mate Henao.\nStage 18.\nStarting from a height of above sea level, the stage steadily descended throughout its entire parcours, except for a few lumps, all the way down to Vedelago at just above sea level. The stage was set up for the sprinters' final chance to claim stage honours in the race; the following two stages were summit finishes in the high mountains – ruling the sprinters out of contention – before the race-concluding individual time trial in Milan. The finish in Vedelago came after a straight run-in, with no potential hazards for late crashes. The opening breakaway of the stage came after just , when four riders attacked off the front of the peloton. The breakaway was made up of Pierpaolo De Negri (), rider Angelo Pagani, 's Stef Clement, and Manuele Boaro of , but with Clement being best-placed at over an hour down on overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez (), there was no real hurry to close them down.\nThe leaders held a lead of around three minutes at the conclusion of the first hour of racing, but were on the front of the peloton in the hopes of extending the points classification lead that Mark Cavendish held over Rodríguez; prior to the stage, Cavendish held a one-point lead over the race leader, after Rodríguez's victory in stage 17. Ian Stannard was given the main duties of setting the tempo, following the withdrawal of Peter Kennaugh during stage 17, and managed to bring the breakaway back prior to the intermediate sprint point; Cavendish led across the line in Cesiomaggiore, following a lead-out from Geraint Thomas. Several mini-attacks occurred prior to a second breakaway being instigated.\nClement was again part of a quartet in front, being joined by rider Olivier Kaisen and 's Martijn Keizer – the two most active riders in the Premio della Fuga classification for most cumulative kilometres spent in a breakaway of fewer than ten riders – with Mickaël Delage completing the quartet for . remained at the front of the peloton with added assistance from , as they looked to keep the breakaway's advantage as little as possible; it was around a minute with to go. Delage later advanced clear on his own with to go, with Kaisen's team-mate Lars Bak attacking out of the peloton once again to join him in a short stint off the front; the pair were caught inside of to go, setting up the bunch sprint. Bernhard Eisel and Thomas positioned Cavendish at the head of the bunch, but Andrea Guardini () finished quickest, having launched his sprint off the wheel of 's Roberto Ferrari, and the eleven-time Tour de Langkawi stage winner took his first Giro stage victory. Guardini's win came after he had been criticised by the Italian media prior to the stage. Cavendish extended his points lead to 29 with second at the line, while Rodríguez maintained his 30-second lead in the overall classification.\nStage 19.\nLike several of the other mountain stages during the Giro to that point, the stage started just above sea level in Treviso before steadily climbing back towards the Dolomites, and the foot of the first of five categorised climbs during the stage, the third-category \"Sella di Roa\". Having descended from that climb, the riders were then immediately climbing once again after that, with the first-category \"Passo Manghen\", a climb with an average gradient of 7.4%; before the first of two ascents of the finishing climb at the \"Alpe di Pampeago\", the first of which going to the \"Reiterjoch\", reaching in altitude. On the finishing circuit of , the riders encountered the second-category \"Passo di Lavazè\", before the \"Alpe di Pampeago\" once again. It was expected that this stage, rather than the queen stage 20, would cause the most alterations in the general classification, but the race winner would become clearer over the two stages, and the final time trial.\nSeventeen riders representing seventeen different teams made it into the breakaway at the mark, including the most recent winner of a stage finishing at the \"Alpe di Pampeago\", 's Emanuele Sella, who won the stage by more than four-and-a-half minutes in 2008. As well as Sella, rider Sandy Casar was part of the breakaway, who in 19th place, was the highest-placed rider in the general classification, having trailed overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by 12' 25\" overnight. By the time that the lead group had reached the \"Passo Manghen\", the advantage was around the ten-minute mark. With Rodriguez's team, as well as the teams of Ivan Basso () and Michele Scarponi (), that advantage steadily fell during the stage, and the margin had been more than halved by the intermediate sprint point of the stage, coming prior to the first ascent of the \"Alpe di Pampeago\", in Tesero.\nOn the climb, Casar pulled clear with Tirreno–Adriatico mountains classification winner Stefano Pirazzi of and 's Thomas Rohregger. Rohregger faded on the climb, and Pirazzi and Casar went clear to the summit. Approaching the summit in the peloton, rider Dario Cataldo went clear off the front of the pack, and was joined by pairing Kevin Seeldraeyers and Roman Kreuziger; Kreuziger and Cataldo then left Seeldraeyers behind, and joined up with Cataldo's team-mate Serge Pauwels, who had dropped back from the breakaway. Sella had bridged himself back up to Rohregger, with both riders later rejoining Casar and Pirazzi at the to go mark; the group only remained together for another as Casar and Pirazzi again ventured clear of the other pair. By now, Kreuziger and Cataldo had gathered ground on Rohregger and Sella, joining them after the latter pair had no response to the attack.\nPirazzi went clear again, with Kreuziger and Casar trying to follow, while in the main bunch, Scarponi was trying to break the group up into a handful of riders, but it was not until Ryder Hesjedal () attacked with remaining that the group splintered. Kreuziger went past Pirazzi and eventually soloed away to his first Giro stage victory, although he – and directeur sportif Giuseppe Martinelli – remained disappointed with his Giro as a whole. Behind, Hesjedal attacked once again, and was not chased down; eventually gaining thirteen seconds on Rodríguez, reducing the latter's advantage to 17 seconds ahead of the final two stages of the race. Scarponi, who finished fourth on the stage behind Rodríguez, moved into third place overall; a 20-second margin over Basso on the stage swung third place in the defending champion's favour by six seconds. Both Rodríguez and Basso felt that the Giro title was Hesjedal's to lose, due to the final stage time trial.\nStage 20.\nThe race's queen stage consisted of five categorised climbs over the parcours. Having commenced the stage with the second-category climb of the \"Passo del Tonale\", the riders contended with a pair of contrasting third-category climbs; the \"Passo dell'Aprica\", a shallow climb with an average gradient of just over 3%, and the \"Teglio\", a near- climb averaging 8%, although reaching 15% in places. Undulating roads set the course for the next hour of racing, up to the foot of the first-category \"Passo del Mortirolo\". The \"Passo del Mortirolo\", returning to the race after being absent in 2011, averages a gradient of in excess of 10% over its length, although the gradient reached 22% in places on the climb. Having descended from there, the riders headed towards Bormio and the start of the climb to the Cima Coppi – the highest point of the Giro d'Italia – of the \"Stelvio Pass\". Although not as steep as the \"Passo del Mortirolo\", the \"Stelvio Pass\" was a climb with an average gradient of only 7%, with the final being the steepest part of the climb, with 12% gradient recorded in certain areas.\nAnother large breakaway group was formed on a mountain stage, as fourteen riders went clear, including the previous day's winner Roman Kreuziger (), former young rider classification leader Damiano Caruso of the team, and incumbent mountains classification leader Matteo Rabottini, looking to extend his advantage in that classification for . They held a lead of up to six minutes at one point in the early running of the stage, but as the group headed towards the foot of the \"Passo del Mortirolo\", their advantage had been cut in half to around the three-minute mark. It was here that the group started to break apart, and it was an attack by Oliver Zaugg of that sent him up the road, having shaken off Matteo Carrara (), who had bridged up to him on the climb. Carrara's team-mate Thomas De Gendt, ninth overall overnight, then attacked off the front of the peloton and caught up to Carrara, with both riders joined by 's Damiano Cunego, who was just behind De Gendt in the general classification.\n then set their sights on getting riders up towards the front, with stage 16 winner Jon Izagirre and Mikel Nieve – winner of the stage to Val di Fassa in 2011 – making their way forward, and also in the process, brought Tanel Kangert of the team into the group, making it a six-man group in chase of Zaugg. Zaugg was caught with around remaining on the stage, while Carrara was replaced in the lead group by another stage-winner from the race, 's Andrey Amador. At this point, the group held a four-minute advantage over the reduced peloton, moving De Gendt and Cunego into contention of getting into the top three overall ahead of the time trial. De Gendt attacked again, which reduced the lead group yet further; once it had settled down once again, only De Gendt, Cunego and Nieve remained together. A third attack by De Gendt later followed and neither of his remaining breakaway companions could match his pace. With to go, De Gendt extended his advantage to five minutes over the -led peloton, putting overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez () in a spot of danger, especially due to De Gendt's superior time trial capabilities.\nDe Gendt started to tire during the climb of the Stelvio, and with John Gadret () attacking from the main field, the gap that he had over the main field was reducing. Ryder Hesjedal lifted the pace in the peloton, reducing the group yet further – to himself, Rodríguez and 's Michele Scarponi – inside the final . As De Gendt won the stage, Scarponi launched forward, and was closely followed by Rodríguez, with no movement from Hesjedal. Cunego finished second ahead of Nieve, while Rodríguez managed to catch and pass Scarponi for fourth on the stage; this result also gave him the lead in the points classification, taking over from Mark Cavendish () by just one point. Hesjedal finished 14 seconds behind Rodríguez, to trail by 31 seconds going into the final time trial stage, while De Gendt moved up to fourth place, 2' 18\" in arrears. Rodríguez's directeur sportif Valerio Piva later stated that it would be \"difficult\" for his rider to win the Giro, due to the close proximity of Hesjedal in the general classification.\nStage 21.\nOriginally scheduled for a distance of , the time trial was reduced to a distance of on the morning of the stage due to road conditions in Milan. The parcours of the stage itself was almost completely pan-flat, with a maximum altitude gain of just . As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. It was scheduled to be 's Andrea Guardini, but he was disqualified the previous day – along with three other riders – for holding on to their respective team cars. Thus, Miguel Minguez of , who, in 157th place, trailed overall leader Joaquim Rodríguez () by five hours, twenty-five minutes and one second, was the first rider to set off on the final stage. He was not the first rider to finish, as 's Taylor Phinney passed both Minguez and his team-mate Adrián Sáez on the course, despite running off course after a mistake by the motorcycle in front of him, leaving Phinney frustrated at the finish.\nPhinney's time held for only a number of minutes as Alex Rasmussen, who was third in the opening stage time trial in Denmark, assumed top spot for in a time of 34' 06\". Almost quarter of an hour passed before Rasmussen was moved from the top of the timesheets, as 's Jesse Sergent was the first rider to break the 34-minute barrier as he recorded a time of 33' 59\" for the course. Sergent's time stood for an hour before rider Geraint Thomas bettered his time by a margin of 14 seconds, but just like the opening stage of the race, his time was eventually only good enough for a second place stage result. Again, Thomas was beaten by a rider, but on this occasion it was Marco Pinotti and not Phinney, that recorded the quickest time for the course. Pinotti passed the two riders that started before him on the course, and completed the course in a time of 33' 06\", 39 seconds better than Thomas and good enough for the five-time Italian time trial champion to take the stage victory, bookending victories in the race for his team.\nThe focus then shifted to the overall classification and the battle for the podium. Ryder Hesjedal () was considered the favourite to take the final \"maglia rosa\" due to him being more proficient in the discipline than Rodríguez. 's Thomas De Gendt was also tipped to take at least third place, as he was in a similar situation to Hesjedal, against defending champion Michele Scarponi (). De Gendt was first to take to the stage, recording a time of 34' 07\" – good enough for a fifth-place finish – and was more than enough to move ahead of Scarponi, who recorded a time of exactly 35 minutes. Hesjedal had moved ahead of Rodríguez on time during the stage, and finished the course eight seconds slower than what De Gendt had achieved. He sealed the Giro title – and the first Grand Tour overall victory for a Canadian rider – several minutes later as Rodríguez finished outside of the 31-second margin that he had held before the stage. Rodríguez – who crashed during a reconnaissance run of the course – finished the stage in 35' 02\", meaning that he finished the Giro with just the points classification, as Mark Cavendish () was unable to finish the stage inside the top 15. De Gendt's third place meant that there was no Italian on the overall podium for the first time since 1995."

The conference took over the organization of the Ivy rugby championships that had been contested since 1969.\nThe Ivy Rugby Conference, and specifically its sevens tournament, has enabled the Ivy schools to tap into existing rivalries and fan bases.\nIvy Rugby has had some past success in attracting commercial sponsors. Sponsors have included H2H, Royall Lyme and Boathouse Sports.\nThe Ivy League schools have a rich rugby tradition that pre-dates the formation of the Ivy conference. Teams in the Ivy League have played rugby games against each other since the mid-1870s and starting in 2024 will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of such rugby games.\nThe eight Ivy League schools competed in the Ivy Rugby Championship Tournament from 1969 until the Ivy Rugby Conference was formed in 2009. The Ivy Rugby logo was developed in 2005.\nIn addition to the traditional 15-a-side rugby union competition, the teams play yearly for the Ivy Rugby 7s Championship held the first Saturday in November.\nChampionship results.\nHistoric results of the Ivy Rugby Championship, organised by the Ivy Rugby Conference since 2009:"

        "text": "The Professional Lacrosse League (PLL) was a men's professional indoor lacrosse league in the United States. It was announced in 2012 with its inaugural season scheduled to begin in September 2012. The league originated in a split with the North American Lacrosse League (NALL). The league ended after a year, in 2013.\nHistory.\nThe Professional Lacrosse League developed out of a rift in the North American Lacrosse League, which was originally scheduled to start play with five teams in January 2012. Weeks before the NALL season was to start, four of the teams – the Charlotte Copperheads, the Hershey Haymakers, the Jacksonville Bullies, and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Shamrocks – announced that the NALL had relieved acting Commissioner Anthony Caruso of duty and would be switching from a winter to a fall schedule. In turn, Caruso responded that his removal was illegitimate and that he remained in charge of the NALL, which would keep to the winter schedule. The dispute went to litigation, with the result that winter faction kept the NALL name and branding, while the fall faction formed the PLL.\nBrett Vickers was announced as PLL League President. The league was supposed to start play with four teams in September 2012, however, it was announced that the Haymakers and Shamrocks franchises had not secured arena leases and were currently searching for new locations.\nOn July 11, 2012, Commissioner Brett Vickers announced on Twitter \"@PLLcommissioner I love throwing people off by setting up websites.\" &amp; \"Heading South...had two great meetings in the two new PLL cities Wednesday and yesterday. Excited about September!\". This added to speculation that New Jersey might not be the league's newest member.\nOn August 28, Brett Vickers resigned from the PLL.\nOn September 6, 2012, New Jersey Rascals CEO announced \"It is with a heavy heart that we announce the New Jersey Rascals will not be playing this season. We believe it is in the best interest of our fans, the Sun National Bank Center, our corporate partners and sponsors to take another year to explore the many ways that we can build on the great momentum we are seeing in the Mercer County area.\" With the loss of the Rascals, the 2012 PLL season was in serious jeopardy. The Rascals tried to become a charter member of the failed United States Lacrosse League."

        "text": "David Pears (born ) is a former English rugby union player, who played for Harlequins and England. He played as a fly-half. He won 4 England caps, the first two on the 1990 England rugby union tour of Argentina, came on as a replacement during the 1992 Six Nations match against France and started at full back against France two years later.\nSchooldays.\nHe grew up in the village of Seaton, on the outskirts of Workington, playing junior Rugby League for the village youth teams coached by his father Reggie. He first went to Moorclose Secondary School before attending Workington Grammar School. Whilst playing school rugby David’s unique skills drew the attention of two physical education teachers, Tom Borthwick and Malcolm Brown, both county stalwarts and stars of Aspatria Rugby Union Football Club. At the age of fifteen he naturally came to Aspatria, after captaining an array of county school sides at both codes of Rugby and Soccer.\nAspatria Rugby Union Football Club.\nHe made his senior debut in the 1985-1986 season when he helped Aspatria win the Cumberland Rugby Union Challenge Cup on two occasions. The 1987 final against Moresby was a personal triumph for Pears who scored fifteen of his sides nineteen points, including a winning try in the final five minutes. He starred again in the following season when Aspatria gained a narrow victory over Cockermouth, with Pears kicking three conversions. However it was the home tie against Wasps in the third round of the John Players Cup that brought him national attention. Although the Wasps fielded a side littered with internationals with Rob Andrews and Nigel Melville the opposition half-backs it was David Pears and his colleague George Doggart who earned the praise. \nAfter leading the County Colts to several memorable victories he was selected to play for the North of England Colts. In 1987 he was called into the squad for the England B international against Italy but suffered an injury and missed the game. Although the 1987-88 season was his last with the Aspatria club he made a memorable exit. He was without doubt the star of the Cumberland Cup winning side that shattered the dreams of Moresby. He made an outstanding contribution to the rejuvenation of the county side; he played magnificently against Wasps and other Pilkington Cup opposition and was instrumental in assisting Aspatria secure a position in the Courage North Division 2 League.\nSale Rugby Union Football Club.\nAt the beginning of the 1988-99 season, in conjunction with teammate George Doggart, Pears signed for Sale. Shortly afterwards he was invited to attend an under 21 international training session at Nottingham. He gained his first England B cap on 22 October 1988, when England were beaten by Australia. He gained his first North Divisional representative cap against the Midlands, a few days before his 21st birthday, scoring nineteen points with five penalties and one try. By 1989, Pears career was riding high, he finished 8th overall in the ‘Top Points’ competition, scoring 239 points, including seven tries, fourteen conversions, fifty-four penalties and seven drop goals.\nHarlequins Rugby Union Football Club.\nAfter spending a season with Sale, Pears moved further south to join Twickenham based club Harlequins, where he spent most of the 1990s. During his time at Harlequins the club reached two Pilkington Cup finals. They won the first against Northampton in 1991 and lost the second against Bath the following year. Both went to extra-time. His junior international career was also gaining strength, with games against the United States of America, Roumania, Ireland, Italy, Fiji, France and Russia.\nInternational.\nPears won four caps for England, the last two against France in Paris, where they won both matches. The first game, in 1992, was a brutal affair. Two of the French forwards were sent off and England won quite convincingly, 31-13.\nPears came on midway through the first half after Rob Andrew suffered a nasty gash to his head. However, within a minute of stepping on the field Jean-François Tordo gave him a crack and broke his nose. That was nothing compared to the rest of the injuries he sustained through his career. He once suffered a suspected broken neck playing in a Seven-a-side game for Harlequins. On another occasion on the Friday before an international against Wales, he tore a hamstring in training, denying him the chance to play at Twickenham. He also broke his ankle the week before Andrew announced his retirement, and missed three whole seasons as a result. He was regarded by many as Andrew's natural successor in the England No.10 jersey but Mike Catt got the opportunity instead.\nFinal years.\nAfter leaving Harlequins he had a short spell at both Bracknell and Worcester. Geoff Cooke tried to persuade him to go full-time at Worcester but he turned the offer down and played his final three years at his wife’s home based team at Wharfedale.\nBibliography.\n "

A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or \"crowding\", home plate.\nBelow is the list of the 100 Major League Baseball players who have been hit by a pitch more than 100 times in their MLB careers. \nHughie Jennings holds the Major League record for most hit by pitches, getting hit 287 times in his career.

        "title": "Racism in New Zealand rugby union",
        "text": "Rugby union is the national sport of New Zealand with the All Blacks as the national team. The All Blacks are made up of many races and cultures, and seven of the fifteen starters in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final were of Polynesian descent.\nHowever, although the national team has a long history of success, it also has on occasion been the subject of racial issues. On the international stage there has been controversy in the tours of and by South Africa, the most famous of which was the 1981 tour by South Africa. These tours drew much international criticism as many states were boycotting South Africa due to apartheid. On the domestic stage there have been issues of racism in the Super Rugby competition. There have also been some instances of racism in college rugby and club rugby. Racism is quite a serious human rights issue in New Zealand, which was highlighted in the Universal Periodic Review by the United Nations Human Rights Council.\nRugby tours of South Africa.\nDue to apartheid in South Africa, it was the policy of the New Zealand Rugby Union not to select Māori players for tours to South Africa prior to 1970. There was much internal and external criticism of the tours, with the slogan 'No Māori - No Tour' being prominent in New Zealand. Recently the Human Rights Commissioner has commended this as the starting point of the campaign to stop the tours. In 1969 an anti-racist rugby tour group named Halt All Racist Tours (HART) was set up to protest future games between New Zealand and South Africa. Some tours were called off due to such pressure, the most controversial of the tours to go ahead was the 1981 tour.\nBackground.\nThe first tour by a South African Rugby team was in 1921. The South African team played one game against a team named the natives, which was made up entirely of Māori. A South African journalist reported that the Springboks were ‘frankly disgusted’ at playing against ‘a band of coloured men'. One telegraph sent back to South Africa by a journalist stated;\nBecause of this policy many of New Zealand's greatest Māori players, such as George Nēpia, missed out on these tours. Public opinion was strongly against the tours and eventually lead to a change. Despite this Māori were still avid supporters of their national team. When the policy was changed in 1970 only four Māori were allowed to travel and were classified as 'honorary whites'. The obvious trouble with accepting the tours was that New Zealand would be seen as supporting the Apartheid regime. However, it is easy to overlook the fact that many players grow up hoping to one day play for the All Blacks and to miss out would be devastating.\nHalt All Racist Tours.\nThe tour policy of South Africa was not well received by the public in New Zealand. In 1969 a group of Auckland University students headed by John Minto formed the group Halt All Racist Tours(HART). The main purpose was to provide a group to protest the tours. The 1970 tour went ahead but South African Rugby Football Union allowed a mixed team to be sent. One of the ways that HART got its message around was by using Badges. The 1973 tour was postponed due to public pressure put on the Labour government, pressure which HART was a major player in. HART's main function was to organise and co-ordinate protests, and while it was not the major player in the 1981 protests it still is seen as one of the main reasons for the eventual discontinuance of the tours. Many other protest groups developed from the same ideals promoted by HART, one prominent group that was very much involved in racial issues was CARE, an organisation that shared many members with HART.\n1976 Tour and Olympic Boycott.\nIn 1976 the All Blacks toured South Africa, with five Maori players and one of Samoan origin. After the IOC did not sanction New Zealand in regard to the 1976 Summer Olympics, many African countries boycotted this Olympic Games.\n1981 Tour.\nAlthough there were issues surrounding all the tours, the 1981 Tour is seen as the most controversial. There were protests all over New Zealand many of them descending into violence dividing the country into two opposing sides. There were over 200 protests which lead to roughly 1500 arrests within a 56-day period. The protest did much to divide families as well, one witness stated;\nThis shows that it was not just a protest around rugby, but also on societal structure and moral values. The protest campaign galvanised and strengthened New Zealand's anti-racist movement. The aftermath of the tour was that there was to be no official sporting contact until apartheid ended. There was one rebel tour by an unofficial team named the Cavaliers in 1986 which embarrassed the New Zealand government who in turn banned the players for two tests. A recalcitrant apology to Māori came in 2010, but only after the South African Rugby Union did so at the prompting of the republic's then minister for sport, Makhenkesi Stofile.\nSuper Rugby and racism.\nNew Zealand has five teams in the Super Rugby competition that is contested between themselves, Australia and South Africa. While there has been success on the field some teams have been plagued by racism off it. New Zealand is a vastly culturally diverse nation and the Super Rugby teams and management reflect this. The issues are not always a product of the teams actions and policies, but many of the issues stem from the supporters of the teams. Much of this is said to highlight an undertone of racism that is common among ageing rugby supporters who stereotype rugby positions and ability.\nCrusaders racial selection policy.\nIn 2010 it was suggested that the Crusaders rugby team selection policy was racist. The allegation that was made was that the Crusaders selection policy was to only include three non-European players. Andy Haden made the accusation that the Crusaders racially discriminate because they select different races on the basis that they are suited to different positions. The club adamantly denied the allegation with many players coming out saying that the claims have no basis. Prime Minister John Key has said that the claims made by Haden were offensive and incorrect. Whether or not this claim was true is still debated, but it did manage to highlight the fact that many people still believe that not all players are equal in skill on the field and that racism could still be present at the top club level.\nRacial criticism of Pat Lam and the Blues.\nIn 2012 the Auckland Blues manager Pat Lam was racially abused via social media by fans that were unsatisfied with his team's performance. There was also criticism leveled at the team itself, mainly suggestions that the Pacific Island and Māori players were to blame. The head of New Zealand Rugby, Steve Tew, has said the taunts aimed at Pat Lam are appalling, and has stated that it highlights the fact that racism is still existent in New Zealand Society. The interesting part of this incident was that it was done via social media meaning that those making the taunts were not ascertainable.\nRacism and grass roots rugby.\nThere have been a few instances of racism at grass roots level, in particular at high school and top amateur divisions. This racial abuse has been said to be New Zealand rugby's dirty secret on more than one occasion.\nRacism in high school rugby.\nEvidence of racism at college level came when eight players from St Bedes College who used the social media website Facebook to make abusive comments about Polynesian players from Wesley College. Their comments included criticism of the Island players' intelligence and that the only reason they succeed in rugby was due to their 'superior brawn'. The rector of St Bedes declared he was disgusted by the comments. A complaint was made to the Human Rights Commission over the matter.\nRacism at club level.\nThere have been occasions that highlight racism as a factor in club level rugby. One example reported was when a brawl at a game between Celtic and McKenzie was said to have been a reaction to the racial abusing of a Polynesian player. Other examples include spectators racially abusing players at a King country game and even one Māori commentator stating that he was abused."

        "text": "Richard Beamish Cricket Grounds are a cricket ground in the Mardyke, Cork, Ireland. The cricket field and facilities are located on the southern bank of the River Lee, and overlooked by University College Cork and St Vincent's Catholic Church. The ground is officially named after Richard Beamish, but it is generally called The Mardyke after the area where it is situated, or the Cricket Club as it is the home ground of Cork County Cricket Club. The Munster representative provincial side, the Munster Reds, also use The Mardyke as their home ground. \nHistory.\nCricket was first played at the Mardyke in 1850. Cork County Cricket Club was formed in 1874, and began playing their home grounds at the Mardyke. It was around the 1890s that a lot of the features of the ground were established, under the stewardship of Sir George Colthurst. Some of the improvements made to the ground around this time were also funded by the nearby Queen's College. Facilities were of a sufficient standard to attract teams from England, including W. G. Grace's London County, who played Ireland at the ground in 1903. The current long room was built for the 1902 International Exhibition. \nThe onset of the First World War led to an end of touring teams playing at Cork, however cricket was played by army and naval forces based in and around Cork. With Irish independence in 1922, the military departed and cricket was more dependent on local civilian players. By the 1950s, the number of touring teams visiting the Mardyke had increased, and the ground hosted its inaugural first-class cricket match in 1947, when Ireland played Scotland. The Mardyke played host to two more first-class matches between the sides in 1961 and 1973. \nIn 2006, the future of the ground was secured for another 150 years, following a legal dispute over ownership between Cork County Cricket Club and the Beamish and Crawford brewing company. In 2017, Twenty20 cricket was first played at the Mardyke, when Munster Reds played the Northern Knights in the 2017 Inter-Provincial Trophy. List A one-day cricket was first played at The Mardyke in the 2021 Inter-Provincial Cup, when Munster Reds hosted the North West Warriors."

        "text": "Robert William Stephenson (born February 24, 1993) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Tampa Bay Rays. A first-round pick of the Reds in the 2011 MLB draft, Stephenson made his MLB debut in 2016.\nAmateur career.\nStephenson began pitching when he was nine years old. He attended Alhambra High School in Martinez, California, which he graduated from with a 4.2 grade point average. Stephenson's senior season for the high school's baseball team began with two consecutive no-hitters. He finished the season with an 8–2 win–loss record and 1.19 earned run average (ERA) in innings pitched. He recorded 142 strikeouts, while walking 23 and allowing 29 hits. Alhambra reached the North Coast Section Division III playoffs' second round.\nStephenson was named the Gatorade California Baseball Player of the Year. He was rated by \"Baseball America\" as the 25th-best prospect in that year's draft, and the 12th best right-handed pitching prospect in the draft. He was invited to participate in the 2010 Aflac All-America Game; Stephenson was named the starting pitcher for the West Team and pitched two scoreless innings. Stephenson committed to attend the University of Washington to play college baseball for the Washington Huskies baseball team.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Reds.\nConsidered a possible first round selection, the Reds selected Stephenson in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, with the 27th overall selection. Stephenson became the Reds' first high school player chosen in the first round of the MLB draft since they chose catcher Devin Mesoraco in the first round of the 2007 draft, and the first prep school pitcher the organization had chosen in the first round since the selection of Homer Bailey in the 2004 draft. Stephenson signed with the Reds for a reported $2 million signing bonus. \"Baseball America\" rated Stephenson as one of the Reds' top ten prospects before the 2012 season, despite his not having made his professional debut. Stephenson began the 2012 season in extended spring training.\nStephenson made his professional debut with the Billings Mustangs of the Rookie-level Pioneer League on June 19, 2012. He pitched five innings and struck out eight batters. In seven games with Billings, Stephenson had a 2.05 ERA, allowing only 22 hits and eight walks in innings pitched, while striking out 37. In July, the Reds promoted Stephenson to the Dayton Dragons of the Single–A Midwest League. For Dayton, Stephenson had a 4.19 ERA in eight starts, as he allowed 32 hits and 15 walks, while striking out 35 batters.\nThe Reds assigned Stephenson to begin the 2013 season with Dayton. After pitching to a 5–3 win–loss record and a 2.57 ERA with 96 strikeouts in 77 innings, he was promoted to the Bakersfield Blaze of the High–A California League on July 18. Less than a month later, after pitching to a 2–2 record and a 3.05 ERA with Bakersfield, the Reds promoted Stephenson to the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Double–A Southern League in August, as Reds' general manager Walt Jocketty said the team wanted to \"fast track\" Stephenson, whom he called \"very impressive\".\nThe Reds invited Stephenson to spring training as a non-roster invitee in 2014. The Reds assigned Stephenson to Pensacola. He appeared in the 2014 All-Star Futures Game. He had a 7–10 record and a 4.74 ERA while striking out 140 batters in innings pitched with Pensacola. The Reds invited Stephenson to spring training in 2015. He began the season with Pensacola, where he pitched to a 3.68 ERA with 89 strikeouts in innings, including a 2.36 ERA in his last ten starts, before he was promoted to the Louisville Bats of the Triple–A International League. After the season, the Reds added him to their 40-man roster.\nAfter competing for a spot in the Reds' starting rotation for Opening Day during spring training in 2016, the Reds optioned him to Louisville to start the season. On April 4, with Homer Bailey beginning the season on the disabled list the Reds added Stephenson to their Opening Day roster. He made his MLB debut on April 7, and was optioned back to Louisville after the start. Stephenson was called up April 19, to make his second start in place of right-hander Alfredo Simon. In his second start, against the Colorado Rockies Stephenson became the first Reds pitcher to complete seven innings up to that point in the 2016 season, allowing just three hits and one earned run while striking out three and walking two. After the game, Stephenson was optioned back to Louisville. In 8 starts for the Reds, he finished 2–3 with a 6.08 ERA in 37 innings.\nOn July 22, 2017, Stephenson was recalled from Louisville. For the season, in 25 games, 11 starts, Stephenson finished 5–6 with a 4.68 ERA in innings. He struck out 86 but walked 53 batters. He spent the majority of the 2018 season with Louisville, only making four appearances for Cincinnati towards the end of the season.\nIn 2019, Stephenson was used as a relief pitcher He appeared in 57 games, all out of the bullpen, and enjoyed career bests in ERA (3.76), WHIP (1.036), K/9 (11.3), BB/9 (3.3), and H/9 (6.0). Stephenson attributed his recent success to letting go of expectations and focusing on the present. In 2020, Stephenson recorded a 9.90 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 10 innings pitched, as eight of his 11 hits allowed were home runs.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn November 25, 2020, Stephenson and Jameson Hannah were traded to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for Jeff Hoffman and Case Williams. In his first season in Colorado, Stephenson posted a 3.13 ERA in 49 games. He struck out 52 batters in 46 innings. He had a 6.04 ERA for the Rockies in 2022, with a 10.38 ERA in eight appearances in August, and was designated for assignment on August 25.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates claimed Stephenson off of waivers on August 27, 2022. He had a 3.38 ERA in innings with the Pirates. On January 13, 2023, Stephenson agreed to a one-year, $1.75 million contract with the Pirates, avoiding salary arbitration.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn June 2, 2023, the Pirates traded Stephenson to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Alika Williams. In 42 appearances out of the bullpen, he registered a 2.35 ERA with 60 strikeouts across innings of work. Stephenson became a free agent following the season.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn January 23, 2024, Stephenson signed a three-year, $33 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels. On April 18, it was announced that Stephenson would miss the entirety of the 2024 season with an undisclosed elbow injury. The following week, the injury was revealed to be a UCL injury that necessitated Tommy John surgery.\nPersonal life.\nStephenson and his wife married in 2017, with fellow Reds pitcher Sal Romano serving as the best man. Robert's mother, Rowena is a Filipino American from Pangasinan."

Originally, the host city was to be Singapore, but it dropped its plan to host the Games due to financial problems. Then the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad, was subsequently chosen to host the games. However Pakistan also dropped its plan to host the games due to conflicts with Bangladesh and India.\nA total of 3842 athletes from 25 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 147 events in 19 sports. Archery and bowling were included for the first time. This medal table ranks the participating NOCs by the number of gold medals won by their athletes.\nAthletes from 19 participating NOCs won at least one medal; athletes from 15 of these NOCs secured at least one gold. Athletes from Japan won 70 gold medals, the most of any nation at these Asiad. China finished second in total medals. South Korea finished fourth in total medals. Host nation Thailand finished the games with 42 medals overall (11 gold, 12 silver and 19 bronze), in fifth spot in terms of total medals.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

        "title": "2013 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2013 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2012–13 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs, played from June 6 to 20, 2013. The defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, who were favored to win the series, defeated the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win their third championship.\nThe Miami Heat's league-best regular season record of 66–16 gave them home-court advantage against the San Antonio Spurs, who finished the regular season 58–24. The San Antonio Spurs won the opening game on the road and eventually took a 3–2 series lead before the Miami Heat won the remaining two games at home to win their second consecutive NBA title. LeBron James, who was named the season MVP, was also named Finals MVP for the second straight year. The Heat's late rally in Games 6 and 7, which also included Ray Allen's clutch 3-pointer in Game 6 to force overtime, has made it one of the greatest Finals of all time.\nFour former NBA Finals MVPs played in the series (the Spurs' Tim Duncan and Tony Parker, and the Heat's Dwyane Wade and LeBron James), the most since 1987. The 2013 Finals also set a record for most international players on either Finals roster (10). This also marks the last NBA Finals series to use the 2–3–2 format, which was introduced in 1985, with the format changed to 2–2–1–1–1 starting in 2014.\nBackground.\nLeBron James and Tim Duncan previously faced off in the 2007 NBA Finals, when James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, which saw the Spurs sweep the Cavaliers in four games, giving San Antonio their fourth NBA title. After the deciding game, Duncan sought out James in the locker room to praise him for a great series and told James that the league would be his someday.\nIn 2010, Spurs president of basketball and head coach Gregg Popovich made a congratulatory phone call to Heat president Pat Riley for signing LeBron James and Chris Bosh to play with Dwyane Wade.\nSan Antonio Spurs.\nThis was the San Antonio Spurs' fifth appearance in the NBA Finals, attempting to win their fifth NBA championship in team history. The Spurs finished the regular season with 58 wins, finishing in first place in the Southwest Division and the second overall regular season record among Western Conference teams. They recorded only two losses in the first three rounds of the playoffs: they swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round in four games, eliminated the Golden State Warriors in six games in the second round, then swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in four games.\nMiami Heat.\nThis was the Miami Heat's fourth appearance in the NBA Finals and the third appearance for three straight years, attempting to win their third NBA championship. The Heat finished with the best regular season record, recording a league leading 66 wins, and first place in the Southeast Division. They swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs in four games before eliminating the Chicago Bulls in five games in the second round, winning four straight games in the series. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Heat defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games.\nRegular season series.\nThe Heat won both games they played against the Spurs during the regular season: 105–100 on November 29, 2012, and 88–86 on March 31, 2013. For the November 29 game at Miami which was nationally televised, Popovich sat out starters Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Danny Green, at the end of a long road trip in order to ensure they had enough rest for the playoffs, as the Spurs had some of the oldest players in the league. NBA commissioner David Stern was outraged when he learned of this and fined the Spurs $250,000 for not informing the Heat, the league or the media in a suitable time-frame that the four players were not making the trip to Miami. Despite the absence of their four starters, the Spurs led the game until the final minute when the Heat came back to win 105–100. The Heat responded somewhat in kind for their trip to San Antonio, as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Mario Chalmers sat out with minor injuries, though those moves were understandable in light of Miami's dominant position for clinching the home-court advantage for the playoffs as well as the end two games earlier of the Heat's record 27-game winning streak. Miami ended up winning anyway thanks to a last-second 3-pointer from the top player they left active for the game, Chris Bosh.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nSan Antonio won the opener as Tony Parker scored on a bank shot with 5.2 seconds in regulation with the shot clock about to expire. San Antonio scored 23 points in the fourth quarter, while limiting Miami to just 16. Parker led the Spurs with 21 points and 6 assists. The Heat held a 52–49 halftime lead, and LeBron James recorded a triple-double in the game with 18 points, 18 rebounds, and 10 assists. However, Miami's Dwyane Wade, who scored 17 points, was shut out in the final period. Chris Bosh, who recorded 13 points, only scored 2 in the fourth quarter.\nGame 2.\nMiami evened the series, using a 33–5 run in the final two quarters after the two teams were neck-and-neck late in the third. During that run, James made a highlight-reel block on a dunk attempt by Tiago Splitter early in the fourth quarter. The Heat also made 10 out of 19 three-point shots, and five players had double-digit scoring games: James (17), Mario Chalmers (19), Ray Allen (13), Bosh (12) and Wade (10).\nGame 3.\nSan Antonio bounced back in Game 3, setting the Finals record for most three-pointers in a game (16), and giving the Heat their worst loss in franchise playoff history. The Spurs ensured the game was a blowout by outscoring Miami 35–14 in the fourth quarter after leading 78–63 at the end of the third. Gary Neal had one of the best games of his career, making 6-of-10 three-point shot attempts and finishing with 24 points, and Danny Green led all Spurs players with 27 points while hitting 7-of-9 from behind the arc. The Spurs shined despite a lackluster game from Parker who scored only 6 points before he had to leave the game due to a hamstring injury. For the Heat, Mike Miller made all five of his three-point shots and finished with 15 points on the night, while Wade led the Heat with 16 points. However, James was held to just 7 of 21 shooting from the field, finished with only 15 points, and did not shoot a free throw for the first time in his Miami playoff career. After a strong showing in Game 2, Chalmers was held scoreless with one assist.\nGame 4.\nThe Heat evened the series again, pulling away from San Antonio in the second half after an even contest at halftime, 49–49. The Heat continued their streak of not losing consecutive games that the team started in January. The Big Three (the trio of James, Wade and Bosh) for Miami finally came together in a big way. James led the Heat with 33 points, while Wade had 32 and Bosh added 20. Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 20 points. Parker started strong with 15 points in the first half, but could not provide the Spurs with any offensive production in the second half.\nGame 5.\nSan Antonio used a marquee shooting performance to down the Heat and take a 3–2 series lead. The Heat trailed the Spurs by double digits for most of the game. Although they finally closed to within one point, 75–74, with 3:05 left in the third quarter, they could not overtake and San Antonio started to pull away after that. Making 42 of 70 shots, San Antonio became the first team to shoot at least 60 percent in an NBA Finals game since the Orlando Magic in Game 3 of the 2009 Finals. Parker led the Spurs with 26 points, while Green scored 24 points, with 6 three-pointers, breaking the all-time record for three-pointers in a Finals series, set by Allen in 2008. Manu Ginóbili, making his first start of the season, had a strong performance with 24 points and 10 assists. Duncan also contributed a double-double (17 points, 12 rebounds), and provided strong defensive support. At one point in the game, Spurs went on a 19–1 run, with Green and Ginóbili scoring most of those points. James and Wade turned in strong performances, leading the Heat with 25 points each, while Allen had five three-pointers (including two four-point plays) and scored 21 points total.\nGame 6.\nThe Heat rode a triple-double performance from James (32 points along with 11 assists and 10 rebounds)—becoming the first player since Magic Johnson in 1991 to have two triple doubles in the same NBA Finals series—and 20 points from Chalmers, while Duncan led the Spurs with 30 points and 17 rebounds; however, Duncan was held scoreless after the third quarter. Fans and media outlets alike have begun dubbing it \"The Headband Game\" in reference to the signature accessory James lost on a dunk with just under nine minutes left in the 4th quarter and did not wear the rest of the way. The game is considered by players and commentators to be one of the greatest games in NBA history. James regards it as one of the best games in which he has ever taken part. NBA legend Johnson called it \"one of the best two or three games\" he had ever seen. On July 17, 2013, Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals received the 2013 ESPY award for Best Game.\nThe Spurs were leading 75–65 at the end of the third quarter, but James sparked a 20–7 run for the Heat to start the fourth quarter, personally scoring 11 of those points. With 10:30 remaining, the Spurs still up 77–70, Miller's shoe came loose but he did not have time to put it back on so he tossed it off court; with one sock and one shoe he received a pass from James and sunk a three-pointer to pull the Heat within four.\nWith 2:09 remaining, the Heat pulled ahead 89–86 but the Spurs went on a run of their own spearheaded by Parker, who shot a stepback three and a reverse layup in consecutive possessions to put his team ahead 91–89. On the next possession, James lost the ball in the post; this eventually led to a pair of Ginóbili free throws after an intentional foul (by Allen) on the other end, pushing the score to 93–89. James committed a second crucial turnover forcing it into the hands of Ginóbili, who was fouled by Allen. Ginóbili missed one of two free throws, setting the stage for the comeback.\nWith 28.2 remaining, the Spurs were up 94–89, and league officials began bringing out the yellow tape to cordon off the floor for the Larry O'Brien Trophy presentation. James missed a three-pointer, but the ball was kept in Heat possession by Wade and Allen both tipping the ball until Miller got the rebound and passed to James, who made the three-pointer to pull within two points with 20 seconds left. After failing to steal the inbound pass, the Heat immediately fouled Kawhi Leonard, who also missed one of two free throws, keeping it a one-possession game at 95–92. James was entrusted with the final shot but missed a 26-foot jumper from beyond the arc. Bosh was able to collect a key offensive rebound before passing to Allen, who stepped backward and made a three-point basket from the right corner with 5.2 left to tie the game. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich had opted for a small lineup to defend the perimeter in the closing moments of the fourth quarter, resulting in the Spurs' Duncan being on the bench as both Heat's three-pointers came off of rebounds. The Spurs had no timeouts left after Allen's shot, but received a de facto extra timeout while officials reviewed video to confirm that Allen had both feet behind the 3-point line when he released the ball. Parker was able to drive the length of the court, but airballed a short series-winning off-balance jumper over James, as the buzzer sounded to send the game into overtime.\nIn overtime, James hit a floater with 1:43 remaining to give Miami a 101–100 lead. That score would hold all the way down to final moments, where Wade missed a jumper trying to extend the lead, and San Antonio getting the rebound with 12 seconds left. The Spurs opted not to call timeout and let Ginóbili get a full head of steam heading towards the basket. However, Allen stripped the ball away from Ginobili on his way up for a shot and recovered the ball, forcing the Spurs to foul him with 1.9 left. Allen made both free throws to put Miami up 103–100. San Antonio still had a chance to send the game into a second overtime, but Bosh, who had a key block earlier in OT, came through with another key block in the final seconds to prevent a three-point game-tying shot from Green and force a Game 7.\nGame 7.\nJames scored 37 points, including five 3-pointers, and grabbed 12 rebounds to lead Miami to a 95–88 victory in Game 7. With the win, the Heat captured their second consecutive NBA championship.\nAfter a 3-point shot by Leonard, the Spurs trailed by just two with 50 seconds remaining in the game. They had a chance to tie the game, but Duncan, guarded by Shane Battier, missed a shot under the basket and a follow-up tip-in attempt. James went on to hit a 17-foot jumper that secured the victory.\nWade scored 23 points and had 10 rebounds, and Battier scored 18 points on six 3-pointers to offset scoreless nights by Bosh and Allen. James tied Tommy Heinsohn's record set in 1957 for most points in an NBA Finals Game 7 win, and won his second straight NBA Finals MVP.\nThis was the last game of Hall of Famer Tracy McGrady's career, as he retired after the 2012–13 season.\nThis Game 7 is the last under the 2–3–2 format before it was changed back to 2–2–1–1–1 the following year.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC and Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy served as commentators. ESPN Radio aired it as well and had Mike Tirico and Hubie Brown as commentators. For the first time, ESPN Deportes provided exclusive Spanish-language coverage of The Finals, with a commentary team of Álvaro Martín, Carlos Morales, and Alejandro Montecchia. "

The game was delayed for 30 minutes due to flash flood warnings.\nJohn Fox of the AFC West Denver Broncos led the AFC \"home team\" against a \"visiting\" NFC team that was coached by the Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy of the NFC North.

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2012 season began on January 5, 2013. The postseason tournament concluded with the Baltimore Ravens defeating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII, 34–31, on February 3, at Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nAll playoff teams in both conferences won at least 10 games, the first time since 2005. This was also the most recent NFL postseason to feature a game that went into double overtime. It was also the first time since 1999 that no Pennsylvania-based NFL team made the playoffs.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern Standard Time ()\"\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games. Fox then televised the rest of the NFC games. CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games and the Super Bowl. All games were broadcast by Dial Global radio.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 5, 2013.\nAFC: Houston Texans 19, Cincinnati Bengals 13.\nFor the second year in a row, Houston defeated Cincinnati in the first game of the playoffs, outgaining them in total yards 428–198 and holding their offense to just two field goals in nine drives (including 0/9 on third downs). The win was especially satisfying for Texans quarterback Matt Schaub, who was playing in his first playoff game in his nine-season career.\nOn the Texans' second drive of the game, they moved the ball 65 yards and scored on a 48-yard field goal from Shayne Graham (a former Bengal). Then, after forcing a punt, they drove the ball all the way to the Bengals 9-yard line, but once again settled for a Graham field goal a few minutes into the second quarter.\nFollowing another Cincinnati punt, the Bengals took their first lead of the game when Leon Hall intercepted a pass intended for James Casey on the left sideline and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown. But the Texans took it back with a 61-yard drive to the Bengals 4-yard line, 46 coming from Arian Foster, that resulted in Graham's third field goal, making the score 9–7 at the end of the half.\nEarly in the third quarter, a fair catch interference penalty on Bengals Chris Lewis-Harris gave Houston the ball on the Cincinnati 49-yard line. Houston then drove 51 yards, featuring a 22-yard completion from Schaub to Andre Johnson, and scored on a 1-yard touchdown run by Foster. The Bengals struck back with Andy Dalton's 45-yard completion to A. J. Green setting up Josh Brown's 34-yard field goal to cut the score to 16–10. Cincinnati managed to force a punt on Houston's next drive, but with just over three minutes left in the third quarter, Johnathan Joseph (another former Bengal) intercepted Dalton's pass and returned it 16 yards to the Bengals 24-yard line. This led to Graham's fourth field goal on the second play of the fourth quarter.\nBengals receiver Brandon Tate returned the ensuing kickoff 43 yards to the 39-yard line, sparking a drive that ended with Brown's 47-yard field goal that trimmed the lead to one score, 19–13. Cincinnati then forced a punt and drove into Texans territory, but on fourth down and 11 from the Houston 36-yard line, rookie receiver Marvin Jones was tackled by Joseph and Shiloh Keo three yards short of the first down marker. Houston then took over and held the ball for the final 2:44 of the game to clinch the victory.\nFoster finished the game with 32 carries for 140 yards and a touchdown, along with eight receptions for 32. He became the first player ever to rush for over 100 yards in each of his first three career playoff games. Tight end Owen Daniels was the top receiver of the game with nine receptions for 91 yards, while Green had five receptions for 80 yards to lead Cincinnati. With this loss, Cincinnati's playoff win drought was extended to 22 years and remains the longest among all 32 NFL teams.\nThis was the second consecutive postseason meeting (and second overall) between the Bengals and Texans. Houston won 31–10 in the 2011 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 24, Minnesota Vikings 10.\nThe Vikings got into the playoffs by a win in their season finale as quarterback Christian Ponder helped lead the team to victory. However, Ponder had suffered a shoulder injury during the win and was declared inactive for Minnesota's playoff game against the Packers. Joe Webb, who had not played in a single game during the 2012 season and had not started at quarterback since 2010, was given the start.\nMinnesota's Marcus Sherels returned the opening kickoff 37 yards to the 35-yard line. From there, the Vikings drove to the Packers 15 with eight running plays, including a 17-yard scramble by Webb. Rookie kicker Blair Walsh finished the drive with a 33-yard field goal to give Minnesota a 3–0 lead. After an exchange of punts, Green Bay drove 82 yards and scored on an 8-yard touchdown run by DuJuan Harris with 33 seconds left in the first quarter. Harris was initially ruled down at the 1, but the call was changed to a touchdown by Mike McCarthy's replay challenge.\nIn the second quarter, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers hit James Jones for 20 yards and Greg Jennings for 32 on a 72-yard drive that ended with a 20-yard field goal by Mason Crosby. After forcing a punt with under two minutes left in the half, Rodgers completed passes to Jordy Nelson for 22 yards, Jennings for 14, and Nelson again for 23 before fullback John Kuhn completed the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run, making the score 17–3 at halftime.\nGreen Bay scored another touchdown on their opening drive of the second half, moving the ball 80 yards in 12 plays and closing it out with Rodgers' 9-yard toss to Kuhn. Meanwhile, all that lay in store for the Vikings was three consecutive turnovers. First, they drove to the Packers 38-yard line, but then linebacker Clay Matthews forced a fumble while sacking Webb and recovered it. Then, following a punt, they drove to the Green Bay 46, only to lose the ball again on an interception by Sam Shields. The Vikings defense forced another punt early in the fourth quarter, but Sherels muffed the kick and Green Bay's Dezman Moses recovered the ball. Later on, another drive into Green Bay territory was ended with no points when the Vikings failed to convert a fourth down and four on the Packers 43-yard line.\nMinnesota eventually managed to score a touchdown on a 50-yard pass from Webb to receiver Michael Jenkins. But by then, there was only 3:39 left in the game.\nRodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown. Harris was the team leader in rushing yards (47) and receptions (five for 53 yards). Matthews had four tackles, two sacks, a forced fumble, and a fumble recovery. Shields had seven tackles and an interception. Webb finished with 180 passing yards, with one touchdown and one interception, while also rushing for 68 yards. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was the top rusher of the game with 99 rushing yards. He also caught a pass for eight yards. Jenkins had three receptions for 96 yards and a score. Webb completed only 11 of 30 passes with a touchdown and an interception in what was his last game as a quarterback; the Vikings converted him to a wide receiver for the 2013 season.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Vikings and Packers. Minnesota won the previous meeting at Lambeau 31–17 in the 2004 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 6, 2013.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 24, Indianapolis Colts 9.\nDespite racking up 419 yards and 25 first downs, Indianapolis was unable to dent the end zone against a stingy Ravens defense, who recorded three sacks, forced two turnovers, and limited them to just four field goal attempts. Meanwhile, Baltimore's offense rolled up 441 yards and 24 points.\nBoth teams blew scoring chances in the first half. After forcing a punt on the opening drive (which Jacoby Jones returned 34 yards to the 48), Baltimore drove all the way to the Colts 11-yard line. But then defensive end Cory Redding stripped the ball from Ray Rice and Lawrence Guy recovered it for the Colts. Then Indy took over and drove to the Ravens 30, only to lose their own fumble when quarterback Andrew Luck was sacked by Paul Kruger and outside linebacker Pernell McPhee dove on the ball.\nIn the second quarter, a 22-yard reception by Ravens receiver Torrey Smith and an 18-yard run by rookie Bernard Pierce set up a 23-yard field goal by Justin Tucker. Following an exchange of punts, Luck completed 4/4 passes for 50 yards on a drive that ended with Adam Vinatieri's 47-yard field goal to tie the game. Jones responded with a 37-yard kickoff return. Four plays later, Rice caught a screen pass from Joe Flacco and ran it 47 yards to the Colts 2-yard line. On the next play, fullback Vonta Leach scored a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Ravens a 10–3 lead with 55 seconds left in the half. But Luck quickly led his team back, completing 4/5 passes for 62 yards to set up Vinatieri's 52-yard field goal, cutting the score to 10–6 at halftime. For Vinatieri, the NFL's all-time leader in postseason scoring, it was the longest playoff field goal of his career.\nMidway through the third quarter, Flacco's 46-yard completion to Anquan Boldin moved the ball to the Colts 15-yard line. Following an incompletion and a false start penalty, he hit tight end Dennis Pitta for a 20-yard touchdown throw, increasing the lead to 17–6. Indianapolis responded with another drive deep into Ravens territory, but it was halted on the 8-yard line where Vinatieri kicked his third field goal of the game (and 48th postseason field goal of his career).\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Colts linebacker Pat Angerer recovered a fumble from Rice, leading to another drive into the Ravens red zone. But this time they came up empty when Vinatieri missed a field goal from 40 yards out. This was Vinatieri's first postseason miss against Baltimore. He had been 18/18 when playing against the Ravens up to this point.\nThe miss turned out to be devastating. Just two plays later, Pierce ran the ball 43 yards to the Colts 18-yard line, and then Flacco finished the drive with an 18-yard touchdown pass to Boldin, giving the team a 24–9 lead. Then their defense closed out the game by forcing two turnovers inside their own 40. First, they stopped the next drive when cornerback Cary Williams intercepted a pass from Luck on the Ravens 15-yard line and returned it 41 yards. Then, after a punt, Indianapolis turned the ball over on downs at the Baltimore 37 with 2:10 left in the game.\nFlacco finished the game 12/23 for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Boldin caught five passes for a franchise playoff record 145 yards (all in the second half). Pierce rushed for 103 yards, while Rice had 70 rushing yards and a 47-yard catch. Jones returned four punts for 57 yards, two kickoffs for 60 yards, and caught an 8-yard pass. Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, who returned for this game after missing most of the season with injuries and had recently announced his intention to retire after the postseason, finished with a team leading 13 tackles and a pass deflection. Kruger had four tackles and 2.5 sacks.\nFor the Colts, Luck finished his first playoff game completing 28 of 54 passes for 288 yards and an interception, while also rushing for 35 yards. Receiver Reggie Wayne caught nine passes for 114 yards.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Colts and Ravens. Indianapolis won the prior two meetings, the last being 20–3 in the 2009 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 24, Washington Redskins 14.\nSeattle overcame a 14-point deficit in the first quarter to earn their first playoff win on the road since 1983. Seattle has now won three straight playoff games against Washington, who were playing in their first home playoff game since 1999. Coincidentally, the Seahawks also ended another playoff futility streak against the Redskins in the 2005 season (game played in 2006) when they beat them 20–10 at home in the divisional game for their first playoff victory at all (home or road) since 1984 on their way to their first Super Bowl appearance. Robert Griffin III faced off against Russell Wilson for the second such instance of both teams starting with rookie quarterbacks in the playoffs, in the Super Bowl era; after T. J. Yates and Andy Dalton had previously done so for the Houston Texans and the Cincinnati Bengals respectively, in the 2011–12 playoffs.\nWashington stormed out of the gate with touchdowns on their first two drives. After receiving the opening kickoff, they drove 80 yards, featuring a 30-yard reception by Pierre Garçon and an 18-yard run by Alfred Morris. Griffin finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown pass to reserve running back Evan Royster. Then the Redskins defense forced a three-and-out, and Richard Crawford gave them good field position with a 12-yard punt return to the 46-yard line. Washington subsequently moved the ball 54 yards and scored on Griffin's 4-yard toss to tight end Logan Paulsen. On the drive, Griffin, who was playing with a severely sprained lateral collateral ligament in one of his knees, further injured the joint. He remained in the game until the fourth quarter but was nowhere near 100% after the opening two Redskins' drives of the game.\nBut Seattle dominated the rest of the game, holding the Redskins to a final total of just 202 offensive yards. The Seahawks responded with a 66-yard drive, including a 19-yard scramble by Wilson, that ended on a field goal by Steven Hauschka. Following a punt, running back Marshawn Lynch's 20-yard gain on a fumble recovery set up their first touchdown of the game. Fullback Michael Robinson also made a big impact on the drive, catching a 19-yard pass from Wilson and capping the drive with a 4-yard touchdown catch. On the next possession, safety Earl Thomas intercepted a pass from Griffin on the Seattle 26-yard line. Wilson's subsequent completions to Doug Baldwin and Zach Miller for gains of 33 and 22 yards set up Hauschka's second field goal, cutting the score to 14–13 at the end of the half.\nSeattle started the third quarter with a drive to the Redskins 1-yard line, but then Lynch lost a fumble that was recovered by Washington defensive end Jarvis Jenkins. In the fourth quarter, he managed to redeem himself with a 27-yard touchdown run. Then Wilson completed a pass to Miller for the two-point conversion, giving his team a 21–14 lead. Then, after the kickoff, Bruce Irvin sacked Griffin for a 12-yard loss. On the next play, Griffin fumbled the snap and as he went to try to recover it, he collapsed to the ground as he tore the already sprained LCL and the anterior cruciate ligament in the same knee. Seahawks defensive end Clinton McDonald recovered the ball on the Redskins 5-yard line, setting up Hauschka's third field goal to make the final score 24–14. Washington responded with a drive to the Seattle 20, but turned the ball over on downs with 1:08 left in the game.\nWilson finished his first playoff game 15/26 for 187 yards and a touchdown, along with 67 rushing yards. Lynch rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown, and caught a pass for nine yards. For the Redskins, safety Reed Doughty had 11 tackles and two sacks. Morris was their top rusher with 80 yards.\nAfter the game, an MRI revealed Griffin suffered partial tears of his anterior cruciate and lateral collateral ligaments in his knee and had to undergo surgery to repair it. In response, Washington coach Mike Shanahan faced criticism for not pulling Griffin from the game earlier, despite warning signs he was playing injured.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Redskins. Seattle won both prior matchups, including the most recent being 35–14 in the 2007 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 12, 2013.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 38, Denver Broncos 35 (2OT).\nBaltimore cornerback Corey Graham's interception from Peyton Manning set up Justin Tucker's 47-yard game-winning field goal 1:42 into double overtime to stun the heavily favored Broncos. This brought Denver's 11-game winning streak to an end and sent the Ravens to their third AFC title game in the last five years. It was the sixth double overtime game in history, the first since 2003 (a game that coincidentally also featured head coach John Fox), and the fourth-longest game in NFL history at a total of 76:42 of game time. With the loss, the Broncos became the ninth #1 seed in the last eight years to lose their first playoff game.\nBroncos receiver Trindon Holliday opened up the scoring by returning a Sam Koch punt 90 yards for a touchdown, the first postseason punt return score in franchise history. Things seemed to get even better for Denver when Jacoby Jones fumbled the ensuing kickoff and was downed on the 6-yard line. But two plays later, Tony Carter was hit with a 25-yard pass interference penalty on third down. Then Joe Flacco tied the game with a 59-yard touchdown pass to Torrey Smith. The situation only got worse for Denver on the next drive, as Graham picked off a deflected pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, making the score 14–7. But Manning rallied his team back, completing 5/7 passes for 69 yards on a 74-yard drive that ended on his 15-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley.\nLater in the second quarter, a 32-yard reception by Broncos receiver Eric Decker set up Manning's 14-yard touchdown pass to Knowshon Moreno. Denver then forced a punt and drove to the Ravens 34-yard line, but this time they failed to score as Matt Prater missed a 52-field goal. Taking the ball back on their own 42 with 1:16 remaining, Flacco hit Anquan Boldin for 11 yards and tight end Dennis Pitta for 15 before finding Smith in the end zone on a 32-yard score, tying the score at 21 at the end of the half.\nHolliday quickly broke the tie just 13 seconds into the third quarter by returning the second half kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown, making him the first player ever to return a punt and kickoff for a touchdown in a postseason game. Later in the quarter, Manning lost a fumble while being sacked by Pernell McPhee, and Ravens outside linebacker Paul Kruger recovered it on the Broncos 37-yard line. Running back Ray Rice took it to the end zone from there with five consecutive running plays (one of them for 32 yards), the last one a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game back up at 28.\nMidway through the fourth quarter, Denver drove 88 yards and scored on a 17-yard pass from Manning to Demaryius Thomas, taking a 35–28 lead with just over seven minutes left in regulation. Baltimore responded with a drive to the Broncos 31-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs with 3:16 left. The Ravens defense had to use all their timeouts on Denver's ensuing drive, but managed to force a punt and get the ball on their own 23-yard line at the 1:09 mark. After an incomplete pass and a 7-yard scramble, in the signature play of the game, Flacco tossed a 70-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jones, sending the game into overtime. The last-second scoring play (and the game itself) was dubbed the \"Mile High Miracle.\"\nAfter the first three drives of overtime ended in punts, Graham intercepted a pass from Manning on the Broncos 45-yard line. On the last play of the first overtime period, Rice's 11-yard run moved the team into field goal range. A few plays later, Tucker kicked a 47-yard field goal to win the game.\nFlacco threw for 331 yards and three touchdowns. Smith caught three passes for 98 yards and two scores. Rice rushed for 131 yards and a touchdown. Graham had eight tackles, two interceptions, and a touchdown. Linebacker Ray Lewis had 17 tackles, the most by any player in the postseason up to this point, while linebacker Terrell Suggs recorded 10 tackles and two sacks. For Denver, Manning completed 28 of 43 passes for 290 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions. Holliday's 90-yard punt return and 104-yard kickoff return were the longest ever in each NFL postseason category, though his record for the kickoff return touchdown lasted only a few weeks before being broken by Jones' 108-yard touchdown return in the Super Bowl. Holliday's 248 total special teams return yards were an NFL postseason record as well, breaking a record previously owned by Andre Coleman and Desmond Howard.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Broncos. Baltimore won the last meeting 21–3 in the 2000 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 45, Green Bay Packers 31.\nIn his first career playoff game, 25-year-old 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick rushed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, setting both the NFL single-game record for rushing yards by a quarterback and the 49ers postseason record for rushing, regardless of position. He also passed for 263 yards and two scores. Overall, San Francisco racked up 579 yards, including a franchise record 323 rushing yards, and scored a touchdown in every quarter to earn their second consecutive trip to the NFC Championship Game.\nHowever, Kaepernick didn't get off to a good start. Less than two minutes into the game, he threw a pass that was intercepted by Sam Shields and returned 52 yards for a touchdown. But he quickly rallied his team back, completing a 45-yard pass to running back Frank Gore before taking the ball into the end zone himself on a 20-yard run. Later in the quarter, Green Bay took a 14–7 lead with Aaron Rodgers' 44-yard completion to James Jones setting up an 18-yard touchdown run by DuJuan Harris. The Packers then forced a punt, but returner Jeremy Ross muffed the kick and C. J. Spillman recovered it for San Francisco on the Packers 9-yard line. Two plays later, Kaepernick tied the score at 14 with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree. Then Tarell Brown intercepted a pass from Rodgers, setting up Kaepernick's second touchdown pass to Crabtree, this one from 20 yards out.\nWith 2:39 left in the half, Rodgers' 20-yard touchdown pass to Jones tied the score at 21. But on the 49ers next drive, a pair of runs by Kaepernick for gains of 19 and 17 yards enabled David Akers to kick a 36-yard field goal, sending the teams into their locker rooms with San Francisco leading 24–21.\nIn the third quarter, Green Bay drove 76 yards in nine plays, featuring a 30-yard reception by Greg Jennings and scored a Mason Crosby field goal. But the tie turned out to be short lived. On the third play of their next drive, Kaepernick faked a handoff, rolled right, and took off for at the time his career long 56-yard touchdown run, retaking the lead at 31–24. Then, after a punt, he completed a 44-yard pass to tight end Vernon Davis, setting up Gore's 2-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter. Following another punt, Kaepernick led the 49ers back for more points, this time on a 93-yard drive. First he ran for a 16-yard gain, and later he completed a 17-yard throw to tight end Delanie Walker. On the next play, Gore's 26-yard burst moved the ball to the Packers 27-yard line. Anthony Dixon eventually finished the 11-play drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, making the score 45–24.\nWith under a minute left, Rodgers threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Jennings. But any hope of a miracle comeback was dashed when Walker recovered the ensuing onside kick attempt.\nCrabtree was the top receiver of the game, with nine catches for 119 yards and two touchdowns. Gore rushed for 119 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 48 yards. Linebacker Patrick Willis had seven tackles and a sack. Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards. Kaepernick finished the game responsible for more yards gained (444) then the entire Packers team (352)\nThis was the final playoff game at Candlestick Park.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Packers and 49ers. Green Bay had won four of the five prior meetings, including winning 25–15 in the 2001 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 13, 2013.\nNFC: Atlanta Falcons 30, Seattle Seahawks 28.\nThe Falcons built up a 20–0 first-half lead, but had to overcome a furious Seattle comeback to earn their first trip to the conference championship game since 2005. Trailing 28–27 with 25 seconds left, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan's completions to Harry Douglas and Tony Gonzalez moved the ball 41 yards in just 12 seconds of game time to set up Matt Bryant's 49-yard game-winning field goal. For Gonzalez, the NFL's all-time leader among tight ends in nearly every receiving category, it marked the first playoff win in his 16-season career.\nAtlanta scored on their opening drive, moving the ball 55 yards on the way to a 39-yard field goal from Bryant. Later in the quarter, Seattle got a scoring opportunity when linebacker Bobby Wagner intercepted a Ryan pass and returned it to the Falcons' 33-yard line. But running back Marshawn Lynch fumbled the ball while being tackled by Sean Weatherspoon and defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovered it. On Atlanta's ensuring drive, a pair of 16-yard receptions by Roddy White and tight end Chase Coffman set up Ryan's 1-yard touchdown pass to Gonzalez.\nOn the last play of the first quarter, Atlanta running back Jacquizz Rodgers ran the ball 45 yards to the Seahawks 42-yard line. Atlanta then continued on to the 19-yard line, where Bryant kicked a 37-yard field goal. Seattle responded with a drive to the Atlanta 11-yard line, but turned the ball over when fullback Michael Robinson was dropped for a 1-yard loss by safety William Moore on fourth down and one. With Atlanta taking the ball back on their own 12, Michael Turner made a 33-yard run before Ryan's 47-yard touchdown pass to White increased their lead to 20–0. Seattle responded with a drive to the Falcons' 11-yard line on a drive that used up all their timeouts. With 17 seconds left in the half, they attempted one last play before sending in the field goal unit, but quarterback Russell Wilson was sacked by Babineaux and the clock ran out before they could run another play.\nSeattle started out the second half with an 80-yard touchdown drive, with Wilson rushing for 19 yards and completing a 19-yard throw to tight end Zach Miller before tossing a 29-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate. Atlanta countered with an 80-yard drive of their own, featuring a 21-yard reception by Julio Jones and scoring on Ryan's 5-yard pass to fullback Jason Snelling. But it wasn't long before Seattle completed the third consecutive 80-yard possession; Wilson hit Tate for 24 yards, rushed for 12, and then completed a 26-yard pass to Miller on the Falcons 13-yard line. A few plays later, he took it into the end zone himself on a 1-yard run, making the score 27–14 with 13:06 left in regulation.\nThree plays into Atlanta's next drive, safety Earl Thomas intercepted a pass from Ryan at the Seattle 38. Wilson then moved the ball into the Falcons red zone with a 24-yard completion to Sidney Rice and a 30-yarder to reserve running back Robert Turbin. On the next play, his 3-yard touchdown pass to Miller cut the deficit down to one score, 27–21.\nWith three minutes left in the game, Seattle's Leon Washington returned a punt 15 yards to his 39-yard line. Then Wilson went back to work, with completions to Tate and Lynch for gains of 19 and 24 yards. Then, with 31 seconds left, Lynch's 2-yard touchdown run gave them their first lead of the game, 28–27.\nRodgers returned the ensuing kickoff 34 yards to the 28-yard line, giving the Falcons the ball with 25 seconds and two timeouts left. On their first play, Ryan completed a 22-yard pass to Douglas near the left sideline, running six seconds off the clock. Then he found Gonzalez over the middle for a 19-yard gain to the Seattle 31-yard line that used up six more seconds before the clock was stopped on their final timeout. With 13 seconds left in the game, Atlanta decided to try the game-winning field goal on their next play. Shortly before the ball was snapped, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll called a timeout, giving Bryant a \"practice kick\" on the field, which he missed. But after the timeout, Bryant's 49-yard field goal kick was good, retaking the lead for Atlanta with eight seconds left on the clock.\nHowever, Seattle was not quite out of the game. Taking the ball on their 46-yard line after Atlanta's squib kick, Wilson's 6-yard completion to Doug Baldwin moved the ball to the Atlanta 48, where he went out of bounds with two seconds left. Rather than attempt a 65-yard field goal (which was two yards longer than the NFL record for longest field goal at that time), Seattle decided to try a Hail Mary pass with their final play. Wilson heaved the ball into the end zone, but Jones, who had been brought in as an extra defensive back, intercepted the pass to seal the victory.\nRyan completed 24 of 35 passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns, with two interceptions. Turner rushed for 98 yards. Rodgers rushed for 64 yards, and added 104 more on five kickoff returns. Wilson threw for 385 yards and two touchdowns with one interception, while also rushing for 60 yards and another score. Miller was the top receiver of the game with eight receptions for 142 yards and a touchdown, while Tate added six catches for 103 yards and a touchdown. Wagner had eight tackles and an interception.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Falcons.\nAFC: New England Patriots 41, Houston Texans 28.\nIn Week 14 of the regular season, New England defeated Houston 42–14. This time around, the Texans managed to keep the score tighter, but the final result didn't change. New England quarterback Tom Brady passed for 344 yards and three touchdowns as he led the team to their seventh AFC Championship Game in his 12 years as a starter. This was also his 17th postseason win, surpassing the NFL's all-time record held by Joe Montana. However, the win did come with a price: Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who suffered a season ending arm injury.\nHouston started out with a huge burst of momentum when Danieal Manning returned the opening kickoff 94 yards to the New England 12-yard line. But a dropped pass by James Casey and an overthrown pass in the end zone forced them to settle for a 27-yard field goal from Shayne Graham. Later in the quarter, Brady completed three consecutive passes for 51 yards on a 65-yard drive on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Shane Vereen.\nOn their next drive, a 30-yard completion to Wes Welker, along with Vereen's 22-yard run and 12-yard reception, set up a 37-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski. Following a punt, Brady completed a 47-yard pass to Welker, moving the ball to the Texans 8-yard line. On the next play, he threw a touchdown pass to Vereen, making the score 17–3. On the ensuing kickoff, a 35-yard return by Manning and a 15-yard penalty against Gostkowski for a horse collar tackle gave Houston the ball at the Patriots 47-yard line. Arian Foster took the ball to the end zone from there with five consecutive running plays, the last a 1-yard touchdown run. Then after forcing a punt, quarterback Matt Schaub completed three passes for 25 yards in a span of just 22 seconds, moving the ball to the Pats 37 where Graham made a 55-yard field goal as time expired in the half and cutting the score to 17–13.\nHowever, New England dominated the second half with 21 unanswered points. On the first drive of the second half, Brady's 40-yard completion to tight end Aaron Hernandez set up Stevan Ridley's 8-yard touchdown run. Later in the quarter, Patriots linebacker Rob Ninkovich intercepted a pass and returned it to the 37-yard line. Ridley then rushed four times for 37 yards on a 63-yard drive that ended with Brady's 5-yard touchdown completion to Brandon Lloyd. Early in the fourth quarter, Houston failed to convert a fourth down and one on their own 33-yard line, and Brady threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Vereen on the next play.\nNow trailing 38–13, Houston made one last comeback attempt. Manning's 65-yard kickoff return gave them the ball on the Pats 37-yard line, where they scored on a five play drive that ended with Schaub's 25-yard touchdown pass to receiver DeVier Posey. Then after a punt, they drove 79 yards, including a 24-yard catch by tight end Owen Daniels and scored on Schaub's 1-yard completion to Foster. On the next play, he completed a 2-point conversion pass to Andre Johnson, making the score 38–28 with 5:11 left in the game. But New England ended their comeback chances when Ninkovich recovered their onside kick attempt, leading to Gostkowski's 38-yard field goal to put the game away.\nVereen finished with 124 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns. Welker caught eight passes for 131 yards. For the Texans, Schaub threw for 352 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Foster rushed for 90 yards, caught seven passes for 63 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Johnson caught eight passes for 95 yards. Manning returned four kickoffs for 216 yards, the third highest total in postseason history.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texans and Patriots.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 20, 2013.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Atlanta Falcons 24.\nSan Francisco overcame a 17-point deficit, the largest comeback ever in an NFC Championship Game, to earn their sixth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. It was their first road playoff win in 24 years. Ironically, the previous biggest comeback in NFC Championship history was the Falcons overcoming a 13-point deficit in the 1998 NFC title game. This marked the seventh year in a row where the NFC Champion came from the division that faced the AFC East in the regular season.\nAtlanta dominated the first quarter, mainly on plays by receiver Julio Jones, who caught five passes for 100 yards, including a 46-yard touchdown catch on their opening drive, and a 27-yard reception on their next drive to set up a Matt Bryant field goal. Following a punt, Matt Ryan hit Roddy White for a 23-yard gain on the last play of the first quarter. Then he threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Jones on the first play of the second, giving the Falcons a 17–0 lead.\nThis time San Francisco struck back with an 80-yard scoring drive, with Frank Gore rushing for 20 yards and Vernon Davis catching a pass for 27. LaMichael James finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown run. Then, after forcing a three and out, Colin Kaepernick rushed for 23 yards and completed three passes to Davis for 48 yards, the last a 4-yard touchdown pass to make the score 17–14. But Atlanta stormed back as Ryan completed five passes for double-digit gains on their next drive, the last one a 10-yard score to tight end Tony Gonzalez with 25 seconds left in the half.\nThe 49ers took the opening kickoff and drove 82 yards, with Kaepernick completing two passes to Randy Moss for 38 yards and one to tight end Delanie Walker for 20. Gore completed the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 24–21. On Atlanta's ensuing possession, cornerback Chris Culliver gave San Francisco a great chance to tie or take the lead by intercepting a pass from Ryan and returning it to the Falcons 25-yard line. But San Francisco failed to gain a first down and came up empty when David Akers hit the uprights on a 38-yard field goal try. Later on, the 49ers got another scoring opportunity when outside linebacker Aldon Smith recovered a fumble from Ryan on his own 40-yard line. They subsequently drove deep into Falcons territory, but once again they failed to score when Dunta Robinson stripped the ball from Michael Crabtree on the 1-yard line as he tried to get in for the go-ahead score, and linebacker Stephen Nicholas recovered it.\nWith 12 minutes left in regulation, Ted Ginn Jr.'s 20-yard punt return gave San Francisco the ball on the Falcons 38-yard line. Five plays later, Gore scored his second touchdown on a 9-yard run, giving the 49ers their first lead of the game at 28–24. Atlanta responded with a drive to the 49ers 13-yard line, but consecutive incompletions on third and fourth down caused a turnover on downs with just 1:13 left in the game.\nAtlanta managed to force a punt and get the ball with 13 seconds to go. Ryan completed a pass to Jones on the final play, but he was tackled at the 49ers 35-yard line as time expired.\nKaepernick completed 16 of 21 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, along with 21 rushing yards. Davis caught five passes for 106 yards and a score. Gore rushed for 90 yards and two touchdowns. Ryan completed 30 of 42 passes for 396 yards and three touchdowns, with one interception. Jones caught 11 passes for 182 yards and two touchdowns, while White had seven receptions for 100 yards. Gonzalez caught eight passes for 78 yards and a score.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the 49ers and Falcons. Atlanta won the only prior meeting 20–18 in the 1998 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 28, New England Patriots 13.\nBaltimore's defense forced three turnovers, held Tom Brady and the New England Patriots to 13 points, and kept them scoreless in the second half en route to their first Super Bowl in 12 years, covering over their previous year's AFC title loss. The Patriots suffered their worst loss of the season and their lowest scoring total of the season despite six trips inside the Ravens 25-yard line. Brady suffered his first career loss at home when leading by halftime, in which during that span he was 67–0.\nIn the first quarter, New England receiver Brandon Lloyd caught two passes for 29 yards on a drive that ended with a Stephen Gostkowski field goal. In the second quarter, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco completed 5/6 passes for 64 yards on an 87-yard drive that ended with Ray Rice's 2-yard touchdown run to take the lead. New England struck back with a 79-yard touchdown drive. The key player on it was Wes Welker, who caught a 24-yard pass and later finished it with a 1-yard touchdown reception from Brady. Baltimore was forced to punt after three plays on their next drive, and Welker returned the ball 15 yards to the Ravens 43-yard line. New England then drove to the 7-yard line where Gostkowski kicked his second field goal as time expired in the half, giving the Patriots a 13–7 halftime lead.\nIn the second half, New England managed several drives deep into Ravens territory, but were unable to convert any into points. First, they drove to Baltimore's 34-yard line, but were halted there and decided to punt rather than attempt a 52-yard field goal. Tight end Dennis Pitta subsequently caught three passes for 32 yards on Baltimore's ensuring 87-yard drive, the last a 5-yard touchdown catch. New England was quickly forced to punt and Jacoby Jones returned it 11 yards to the 37. Baltimore then drove 63 yards, featuring a 23-yard reception by Torrey Smith and scored on Flacco's 3-yard touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin on the first play of the fourth quarter.\nThe Ravens dominated the final quarter, forcing a turnover on every New England drive. First, Pats running back Stevan Ridley lost a fumble while being tackled by Bernard Pollard and defensive end Arthur Jones recovered it on the New England 47-yard line. Three plays later, Flacco threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Boldin, making the score 28–13. The Patriots then drove to the Ravens 19-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs after failing to convert a fourth down and 4. Following a punt, New England moved the ball back to the Ravens 19, only to lose it again when Brady threw a pass that was tipped by Pernell McPhee at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by Dannell Ellerbe. After another Ravens punt, Cary Williams put the game away by intercepting a pass from Brady in the end zone with 1:13 left in regulation.\nFlacco threw for 240 yards and three touchdowns. Linebacker Ray Lewis had 14 tackles, giving him a staggering 44 total tackles in the Ravens three playoff games. Brady threw for 320 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions. Welker caught eight passes for 117 yards and a touchdown, while also returning four punts for 56 yards. Pats linebacker Brandon Spikes had 11 tackles.\nThe Ravens became the first team to win the AFC Championship on the road since the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers and were the last road team to win a conference championship game until the Los Angeles Rams and New England Patriots won their respective conference championship games in 2018. It would also ultimately be the last time the Patriots would lose a home playoff gane until they lost a game in the wild card round of the 2019 season to the Tennessee Titans, which would ultimately be Tom Brady's final game with the team.\nThis was the second consecutive postseason meeting and third overall between the Ravens and Patriots. Both teams split the prior two meetings, with New England winning the 2011 AFC Championship Game 23–20.\nSuper Bowl XLVII: Baltimore Ravens 34, San Francisco 49ers 31.\nAlthough this game was looking to be a blowout win for the Ravens after a 21-6 first half lead, the 49ers rallied to keep it close, but the game came down to the Ravens hanging on to a 5 point lead in the final seconds and intentionally giving up a safety for the resulting final score. This was the third Super Bowl in five years, after XLIII and XLV, to not feature either #1 seed from either conference.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Ravens and 49ers."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured Pakistan in February to March 1980 to play a three-match Test series against Pakistan. Pakistan won the test series 1–0.\nSummary.\nThe Series was Javed Miandad's first as a captain, following the retirement of Asif Iqbal. Pakistan was criticised by analysts for producing doctored pitches that were seen to neutralize Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee who ended the three test series with only 3 wickets.\nThe first test in Karachi, saw Pakistan come away victors, and gave Miandad his first test victory as captain, after limiting Australia to only 225 and 140, leaving a Day 4 chase of only 74, which Pakistan chased down for the loss of only three wickets. \nIn the second test at Faisalabad, after no play was possible on the first day, Australia would bat until Day 4 and the game would finish with Pakistan only two wickets down in their first innings but still 235 runs behind Australia. Overall 336 overs were bowled in the match for only 12 wickets. While Australia would create their own history, by bowling all 11 players, including wicket keeper Rod Marsh who would bowl 10 overs alone.\nThe third and final test in Lahore would again finish in a draw, with both teams declaring their first innings for over 400 runs, but Australia would bat out the final day, ensuring Pakistan a 1-0 series win.\nBackground.\nThere was some doubt as to whether the tour would go ahead due to financial problems.

This article covers all tournaments that were part of that year's Women's Grand Prix.\nVirginia Slims Circuit.\nPrior to the establishment of this circuit there was an inequality between the prize money purses for male and female tennis players which gave rise to complaints from a number of the leading female tennis players of the time.

This resulted in the first Virginia Slims-sponsored event being held in September 1970 in Houston, an event which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the annual Virginia Slims Circuit the following year.

Under the format used from 1950 through 1987, the bracket was often adjusted after the field was pared to four teams in order to avoid rematches from earlier rounds. Starting in 1988 and continuing through 2002, the eight teams were divided into two four-team brackets, with the bracket winners meeting in a single championship game. In 2003, the single championship game was changed to a best-of-three series.\nThis CWS was best known for Stanford's dramatic 6-5 win over LSU in an elimination game. In that game, Stanford trailed 5-2 in the bottom of the 10th inning with 2 outs and nobody on base.

The Cardinals rallied behind a 22-point effort by Final Four MOP Luke Hancock, 18 points and 5 assists from senior captain Peyton Siva, and 15 points and 12 rebounds from sophomore Chane Behanan to win, 82–76, giving Louisville basketball its third NCAA Championship and giving coach Rick Pitino his first title at Louisville.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#AD0000; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#AD0000; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#AD0000; color:#FFFFFF;;\"|Big East regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#AD0000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Big East tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#AD0000; color:#FFFFFF;\"| NCAA tournament\nRankings.\nSource:\nAwards.\nBest Coach/Manager ESPY Award\nControversies and scandals.\nA former Louisville player, Andre McGee, arranged and paid for strippers and prostitutes to perform striptease dances and sexual acts for 17 prospective and former basketball players from 2010 to 2014. On October 3, 2015, the book publisher IBJ Custom Publishing released a book entitled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules\". Based on revelations provided by the local self-described escort, Katina Powell, the book detailed striptease dances and acts of prostitution that Powell and McGee arranged and organized in Minardi Hall over approximately a four-year period.\nDuring the investigation of the allegations, the university self-imposed a ban on the 2016 NCAA tournament. In June 2017, the NCAA announced that the university would lose four basketball scholarships over the course of four seasons, but there would be no further postseason ban. The NCAA had initially suspended head coach Rick Pitino for five ACC games during the 2017–18 season, but the Louisville athletic association board agreed unanimously to fire Pitino before the season on October 16, 2017. The NCAA also ordered the university to vacate all wins from 2011 to 2014 (including the 2013 National Championship) that included ineligible players, a decision that the university appealed. On February 20, 2018, the NCAA upheld the decision."

Since 2022, the top four finishers participate in the double-elimination tournament, which is played at the home field of the top seed. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship. The tournament began in 1981, but was not held from 1984 through 1991. It returned in 1992 and was held annually through 2019. It was scheduled to be played in May 2020, but was cancelled in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. As part of several changes announced in May 2020 related to the pandemic, the tournament was eliminated along with the post-season tournaments of seven other sports, for at least four seasons. The tournament, however, returned in May 2022 after the conference announced in May 2021 that the baseball tournament, along with all other conference tournaments that had been eliminated, would be restored for the 2021–22 athletic season. Kent State has won the most tournament titles with 12, followed by Central Michigan and Eastern Michigan with four each.\nFormat and location.\nThe MAC baseball tournament is held in mid to late May at the conclusion of the regular season. Beginning with the 2022 tournament, the format returned to its original setup with the top four teams from the regular season playing in a double-elimination bracket, hosted by the top seed. This format was also used from the tournament's inception 1981 through 1983 and again when it was revived in 1992 through 1997. The 1992 tournament was also when All-Tournament Team and Most Valuable Player were instituted. Beginning in 1998, the conference was divided into East and West divisions for the regular season and the tournament format was expanded to a six-team field in a double-elimination bracket, with the top three finishers from each division qualifying. In 2001, the format changed from the top three in each division to the top six overall. Beginning in 2008, the tournament was changed to an eight-team, double-elimination field and moved to a neutral site, first to V.A. Memorial Stadium in Chillicothe, Ohio from 2008 through 2011, followed by All Pro Freight Stadium in Avon, Ohio, where it remained through 2019 and was scheduled to be held in 2020. The number of teams remained constant through the 2017 tournament, but was reduced back to six teams for the 2018 and 2019 tournaments following the loss of Akron in 2015 and Buffalo in 2017.

        "text": "Jarvis &amp; Sons Limited were South London-based motor dealers for Morris and MG, and latterly coachworks providing special bodies for various car chassis until after World War II.\nOperations.\nLike many similar UK motor dealers and coachworks, they started out in the late 19th century as bicycle manufacturers, later incorporated as Jarvis &amp; Sons Limited.\nFrom the 1920s, they founded coachworks, operating from premises in both Victoria Crescent and Hartfield Road in Wimbledon, and a motor dealership known as Jarvis of Wimbledon based at Morris House in Morden Road SW 19, on the borders between Wimbledon and Morden which was then located in Surrey.\nCoachbuilding operations utilised a variety of chassis, including Rolls-Royce and the then Cricklewood-based Bentley Motors, and at least one Bugatti Type 30. and a type 40 (chassis # 40470). However, due to the resultant volume of orders many of the projects were subcontracted to other coachworks, in particular Abbey Coachworks of Merton.\nPost-WW2, having acted as a shadow factory during hostilities, the company continued as a car dealership. Today the 1937 art-deco inspired building with clock tower has been demolished, and the former site has been redeveloped and is presently used by a Peugeot cars dealership.\nJappic.\nDesigned and driven by H.M. Walters who was a director of Jarvis of Wimbledon, he was also a works rider for Zenith and Panther , the Jappic was advertised as the \"world's smallest racecar\". Built by Jarvis, the two-seater cyclecar used an air-cooled two-port overhead-valve 74x80mm single-cylinder 344cc JA Prestwich \"JAP\" motorcycle engine, sat in an ash wood frame covered with 3/32 inch steel flitch plates and tubular cross-members. A three-speed gearbox used a chain-drive to the rear axle, with only the rear live axle equipped with brakes, with all four wheels using 650x65 motorcycle tyres. Weighing in at only and costing just £150 to buy, the car was aimed at competing in the holiday-handicap races. After Walters broke the Class J flying mile record in the car at a speed of , it was subsequently advertised being able to lap Brooklands at over .\nJarvis had planned to commercially produce the small racing car, but as the venture never took off commercially, they tried to re-market the vehicle again in 1926 with a larger 495cc JAP engine. But again the venture failed, and so in late 1926 they sold the sole prototype vehicle to noted WW1 ambulance driver and then racing driver Mrs Gwenda Stewart. Under copyright agreement with JAP/Walters/Jarvis, she had to change the name to Hawkes-Stewart, and then retro-fitted the vehicle with an original 344cc engine. The car went on to break 50kms and 100kms records at an average speed of nearly 70 mph , and was destroyed by a fire at the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry in 1932.\nRacing cars.\nJarvis built a reputation for building several successful, aerodynamic design concept bodies, for several well-known 1920s racing drivers.\nAt the start of the 1924 season Woolf Barnato swapped his racing Wolseley Racing Moth for an eight-litre Hispano-Suiza H6C, which he commissioned Jarvis to build a suitable racing body for. Barnato then established an eight-litre class racing record for the car. In late 1924 he obtained a prototype Bentley 3 Litre chassis, which was subsequently fitted with a boat-tail body by Jarvis for a cost of £400. Partnered in 1925 by John Duff, Barnato used the car to win several major Brooklands races, and set a new 3 Litre 24-hour record averaging in 1925. Barnato continued to race the Jarvis-bodied Bentley into 1926, in which he obtained a first and a second at the Easter 1926 BARC races, but then unexpectedly sold it to J. G. Parry-Thomas, who intended to modify it and use it to compete in 1927. However, having modified his land speed record car \"Babs\" over the winter, Parry-Thomas was killed in \"Babs\" at Pendine Sands, Wales on 3 March 1927. His estate sold the car, and it then next competed in the 1928 season equipped with a Parry Thomas frontal cowling, driven by Dudley Froy.\nThe noted racing driver and later World land speed record holder Sir Malcolm Campbell had both his own garage at the Brooklands racing circuit, as well as a motor dealership, \"Bluebird Garage\" on Chelsea's fashionable King's Road. After he took on the new franchise of selling American-built Chrysler Corporation vehicles from 1925, he commissioned his regular racing mechanic Leo Villa to take a Chrysler Model 70 chassis (actually a re-badged Maxwell automobile design), and build him a new racing car under the guises of a marketing exercise. Villa reworked the chassis and engine, and then commissioned Jarvis to build a suitable aerodynamic body. Driven by Campbell, the original \"Chrysler Bluebird\" won the Short Handicap at Brooklands on 12 September 1925, at an average speed of .\nIn the same year, having realised that his Sunbeam car would then quickly restrict his world record speed attempts above , Campbell commissioned C. Amherst Villiers at the Robin Hood Engineering Works in Putney Vale to build the first of his \"Bluebird\" record-breaking cars. Taking two years to construct under the supervision of Villa, the Napier-Campbell Blue Bird was designed by Villiers to reach . The 1927 original version contained a Napier Lion aero-engine within a custom-design chassis, encased in an aerodynamic body co-designed and then built by Jarvis. In its later second and third guises, Villers improved the aerodynamic efficiency of the Jarvis bodywork within a wind tunnel.\nIn the 1930s, Jarvis was the main sponsor of the EX-type Magic Midget's record-breaking cars."

        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India in the 1986–87 season to play a three-match Test series and a five-match one day international series against India.\nThe Test series was drawn 0-0, with one tie, and India won the one-day series 3–2. It is best remembered for the tied first Test – only the second time this result has occurred in Test cricket.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just lost two-Test series against New Zealand and only narrowly held on to a 0–0 draw against India during the 1985–86 summer. The team was in a rebuilding phase, with Bob Simpson having newly been appointed as coach. However Australia were not unfamiliar with Indian conditions having recently toured in 1984.\nThe original squad was selected by Lawrie Sawle, Greg Chappell, Jim Higgs and Bobby Simpson. It was announced on 30 April 1986:\nA number of top-level Australian cricketers were unavailable for selection because they had signed to tour South Africa and were banned from playing international cricket.\nSelection panel on tour: Border, Boon, Simpson\nWayne Phillips had been Australia's wicketkeeper over the 1985–86 summer, then replaced by Tim Zoehrer and tried as a batting specialist. However he was overlooked for selection – the only member of the New Zealand tour squad not picked to go to India. On the night of his non-selection Phillips told the media \"I'm going to do what I want to do and not be at the beck and call of these idiots who pick the side.\" He was fined $2,000 by the Australian Cricket Board and never played cricket for Australia again.\nAllan Border returned early from county cricket with Essex on 19 August to prepare for the tour. The Australian squad attended a special six day training camp with Simpson, Greg Chappell and Ashley Mallett.\nTest series summary.\nFirst Test.\nSee Tied Test for details.\nODI series.\nIndia won the Charminar Challenge Cup 3–2.\nSummary.\nThe tour established David Boon and Geoff Marsh as Australia's opening combination, and Dean Jones as a Test batsman. Greg Matthews appeared to establish his credentials as a top line spinner. Jones later argued the tied Test marked a turning point in Australian cricket, although Australia went on to lose the 1986–87 Ashes series 2–1. By the end of that series, Boon, Ritchie, Matthews, McDermott, Davis, Gilbert and Bright had all been dropped from the Australian Test team.\nThe experience gained by the players did prove valuable for Australia in their campaign to win the 1987 World Cup in India."

        "title": "Operation Olympic Games",
        "text": "Operation Olympic Games was an ostensible and still unacknowledged campaign of sabotage by means of cyber disruption, directed at Iranian nuclear facilities likely by the United States and Israel. As reported, it is one of the first known uses of offensive cyber weapons. Started under the administration of George W. Bush in 2006, Olympic Games was accelerated under President Obama, who heeded Bush's advice to continue cyber attacks on the Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz. Bush believed that the strategy was the only way to prevent an Israeli conventional strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.\nHistory.\nDuring Bush's second term, General James Cartwright, then head of United States Strategic Command, along with other intelligence officials presented Bush with sophisticated code that would act as an offensive cyber weapon. \"The goal was to gain access to the Natanz plant's industrial computer controls ... the computer code would invade the specialized computers that command the centrifuges.\" Collaboration happened with Israel's SIGINT intelligence service, Unit 8200. Israel's involvement was important to the United States because the former had \"deep intelligence about operations at Natanz that would be vital to making the cyber attack a success.\" Additionally, American officials wanted to \"dissuade the Israelis from carrying out their own preemptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities\". To prevent a conventional strike, Israel had to be deeply involved in Operation Olympic Games. The computer virus created by the two countries became known as \"the bug,\" and Stuxnet by the IT community once it became public. The malicious software temporarily halted approximately 1,000 of the 5,000 centrifuges from spinning at Natanz.\nA programming error in \"the bug\" caused it to spread to computers outside of Natanz. When an engineer \"left Natanz and connected [his] computer to the Internet, the American- and Israeli-made bug failed to recognize that its environment had changed.\" The code replicated on the Internet and was subsequently exposed for public dissemination. IT security firms Symantec and Kaspersky Lab have since examined Stuxnet. It is unclear whether the United States or Israel introduced the programming error.\nSignificance.\nAccording to the \"Atlantic Monthly\", Operation Olympic Games is \"probably the most significant covert manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum since World War II, when Polish cryptanalysts broke the Enigma cipher that allowed access to Nazi codes.\" \"The New Yorker\" claims Operation Olympic Games is \"the first formal offensive act of pure cyber sabotage by the United States against another country, if you do not count electronic penetrations that have preceded conventional military attacks, such as that of Iraq's military computers before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\" Therefore, \"American and Israeli official action can stand as justification for others.\"\n\"The Washington Post\" reported that Flame malware was also part of Olympic Games.\nLeak investigation.\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Cartwright was the target of a year-long investigation by the US Department of Justice into the leak of classified information about the operation to the US media. In March 2015, it was reported that the investigation had stalled amid concerns that necessary evidence for prosecution was too sensitive to reveal in court.\nReferring to unnamed sources within the CIA and NSA, the documentary film \"Zero Days\" claims that the Stuxnet/Olympic Games malware was just a small part of a much larger mission to infiltrate and compromise Iran—\"Nitro Zeus\" (NZ)."

The season featured two new ranking events: the Wuxi Classic and the International Championship. The tour had a record five ranking events in China, and three new PTC events in Asia. The tour also visited Bulgaria for the first time in its history, and returned to Poland, Belgium and Australia. Before the start of the season World Snooker requested every player to sign a players contract, that would allow players to choose which events they want to enter – no player was forced to play in any event. At the end of the season Mark Selby was named the \"World Snooker Player of the Year\", the \"Snooker Writers' Player of the Year\" and the \"Fans' Player of the Year\" and Ian Burns the \"Rookie of the Year\". Ronnie O'Sullivan received the \"Performance of the Year\" for winning his fifth World title after playing just one competitive match during the season. Jimmy Robertson's 57 break in just 130 seconds at the Snooker Shoot Out received the \"Magic Moment of the Year\" award. Terry Griffiths, Joe Johnson, Peter Ebdon, Ken Doherty, Graeme Dott, Shaun Murphy and Neil Robertson were inducted into the Hall of Fame.\nThe season had a total of £7.1 million of prize money. The World Championship, the UK Championship, the International Championship and the Masters were the four biggest tournaments in terms of prize money with the total pot being over half a million pounds at each event. A further £5,000 was on offer at the televised stages of each ranking event for any player who compiled a maximum break and this prize rolled over from one tournament to the next if not won. A £500 rolling prize was given to any player who completed the feat in the qualifying stages of ranking events. A separate £500 rolling prize was also available in all the PTC events, but this prize was excluded from the Asian PTCs. If at any tournament a 147 was made by more than one player, then the prize was equally shared.\nNew professional players.\nCountries\nThe 2012/2013 season was made up of 99 professional players. The top 64 players after the 2012 World Championships automatically qualified for the 2012/2013 season as did the top eight who were not in the top 64 from the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit. Another twelve places were available through the 2012 Q School; the rest of the places on to the tour came from amateur events and national governing body nominations. All players except those in the top 64 received a tour card for two seasons.

He also made the second round of the singles draw, after beating Steve Shaw.\nIn the 1988 Stella Artois Championships, held at the Queen's Club in London, Turner had an upset win over world number 23 Slobodan Živojinović. Turner was the world's 742nd ranked player at the time. He was eliminated in the second round by Broderick Dyke.\nTurner made his Grand Slam singles debut at the 1989 Wimbledon Championships, having received a wild card. Although the opening round match went to five sets, Czech player Karel Nováček defeated Turner. His only other singles appearance in Wimbledon, the following year, would also result in a first-round exit, to Guillaume Raoux.\nHe however never failed to get past the first round of the men's doubles at Wimbledon, in his four appearances at the tournament. In the 1989 he partnered Stephen Botfield and the pair defeated sixth seeds Paul Annacone and Christo van Rensburg. He also teamed up with Botfield at the 1990 Wimbledon Championships, where they made the round of 16. Their two wins both came in five set matches but when they were knocked out of the draw by Stefan Kruger and Greg Van Emburgh, it was in straight sets."

        "title": "Boxing in Japan",
        "text": "The history of boxing in Japan began in 1854 when Matthew Perry landed at Shimoda, Shizuoka soon after the Convention of Kanagawa. At that time, American sailors often engaged in sparring matches on board their ships, with their fists wrapped in thin leather. It was the first example of boxing conveyed to Japan. In addition, an \"ōzeki\"-ranked sumo wrestler named Koyanagi was summoned by the shogunate, and ordered to fight a boxer and a wrestler from the United States. There were three fought matches, using different martial arts' styles, before Perry and other spectators. Koyanagi reportedly won.\nHistory.\nThe first exhibition match named was held in Tsukiji, Tokyo in 1887. The first boxing gym was established in Ishikawachō, Yokohama, Kanagawa by and in 1896. After the first tutorial book, was issued in 1900, followed shortly by was opened in Mikage, Kobe by in 1909.\nAfter learning boxing in San Francisco, California, since 1906, established in Shimomeguro, Meguro, Tokyo, on December 25, 1921. from Rikkyo University began boxing under Watanabe's management. Ogino in the junior featherweight and in the featherweight were recognized as the first Japanese champions by Nippon Kentō Club in 1922.\nIn the first Japanese title matches for professional boxers held in April 1924, Fuji Okamoto in the flyweight division and Kintarō Usuda in the lightweight division became titleholders. There was no clear distinction between amateur and professional around that time.\nInauguration of Federation.\nSimultaneously with whose president was Yūjirō Watanabe, the was established in July 1926. \nThe first Japanese championships for amateur boxers was held by in 1927. Fuji Okamoto in the bantamweight division and Kintarō Usuda in the welterweight division participated in the 1928 Summer Olympics.\n founded in February 1931 in order to perform the establishment of championships and the development of professional boxers, repeated division and dissolution to become the current Japan Pro Boxing Association (JPBA). from Waseda University gained popularity and played an active part in those days. Although Japan's boxing was interrupted by the Pacific War, the first Japanese championships after the war was held in 1947.\nWorld title match.\nThen the Japan Boxing Commission (JBC), virtually the only governing body of Japan's professional boxing, was founded in order to prepare Yoshio Shirai's world title match. Its establishment was presented at the Tokyo Kaikan on April 21, 1952. from Waseda University who was the founding president of Teiken Boxing Gym and the president of the Korakuen Stadium, was elected as its first commissioner.\nShirai defeated lineal champion Dado Marino via a unanimous decision in the flyweight division on May 19 of that year, while being watched by 45,000 spectators at the Korakuen Stadium, to become the Japan's first world champion.\nWBA and WBC.\nThe JBC has joined the NBA (the current WBA) as of January 7, 1954. They have also joined the WBC since the rematch of Johnny Famechon vs. Fighting Harada in May 9, 1970.\nBoxing Magazine.\nIn June 1956, \"Boxing Magazine\", the Japan's oldest surviving boxing journal, was launched by the Baseball Magazine Company. Currently there is only one other monthly boxing journal in Japan, called \"Boxing Beat.\" This has been renamed twice from \"World Boxing\" since 1968.\nPro-Am joint training.\nTraditionally, the different bodies of amateur and professional boxers had had no exchanges. However they decided in 2011 to cooperate with each other, beginning with joint training.\nFrom 2011 through 2012, the middleweight boxers had record-breaking performances both in amateur and professional boxing. Nobuhiro Ishida knocked out the previously undefeated James Kirkland at the MGM Grand Las Vegas to be awarded \"The Ring\" Upset of the Year. Ryōta Murata secured the silver medal in the World Amateur Boxing Championships in Baku, Azerbaijan to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Tadashi Yuba won his fifth Japanese title in four different weight divisions to be a quadruple champion. All those are the first records for Japan. In August 2013, Yuba picked up the Japanese super welterweight title to be a quintuple champion.\nTelevision.\nMost of the world championship fights have been televised mainly on Nittere (NTV), TBS, Fuji TV, and TV Tokyo. Currently, these programs can be legally watched outside Japan via KeyHoleTV. In addition, pay-TV channels such as WOWOW and sky-A sports+ have provided boxing programs. Although Fuji TV had been withdrawn from boxing except for the late-night show since Yūji Watanabe lost to Genaro Hernández in 1992, they resumed a live boxing program in prime time from April 2013.\nAmateur boxing.\nSummer Olympics.\nThe Summer Olympics medalists are:\nWorld Championships.\nThe World Championships medalists are:\nProfessional boxing.\nIn Japan, every professional boxer must contract with a manager under the JBC rules, and is required to belong to a boxing gym which has exclusive management rights for boxers as a member of each regional subsidiary body of Japan Pro Boxing Association under the Japan's conventional gym system. Two professional boxers belonging to the same gym have not been allowed to fight against each other unless one of them transfers to other gym, because it might disrupt the gym system. However, it is often quite difficult for boxers to transfer between the gyms due to the matters on transfer fees, match fees and so on.\nThe JBC set up the Japanese heavyweight title once in 1957, but that division did not last long because there were few heavyweight boxers in Japan at that time. Therefore, they have recognized the titles and ratings only in thirteen weight divisions from minimumweight to middleweight for over fifty years. They added four weight divisions i.e. super middleweight, light heavyweight, cruiserweight and heavyweight, from September 2009. Kyōtarō Fujimoto was crowned the heavyweight champion in July 2013.\nTournaments.\nCurrently Japan has two major annual tournaments. One is the Tournament which came to be known by the popular anime/manga series Hajime no Ippo, and the other is the Japanese Title Elimination Tournament nicknamed which is competed by \"class A boxers\" who have acquired a \"class A license\" to fight in eight or more round bouts, and whose winners would be recognized as the next mandatory challengers against each divisional Japanese champion in the annual mandatory bout series Champion Carnival. In addition to those, there are several other tournaments such as Raging Battle (renamed from B:Tight!).\nBoxing today.\nAs of Feb 2022, Japan produced 85 male world champions and 23 female world champions. When Yōta Satō won the world title to be the twelfth world champion managed by Kyoei Boxing Gym in March 2012, Japan had had nine world champions at the same time including an \"emeritus champion\" and a \"champion in recess\". Although nine boxers except non-Japanese nationals and females were crowned world champions across the sea, it is in contrast to the status of boxing in the Philippines where 31 of 40 world champions won the title abroad as of April 2016. Katsunari Takayama fighting out of the ALA Boxing Gym of Cebu City has won the IBF title in 2013, after resigning his JBC license in 2009 in order to compete for the IBF or the WBO title outside Japan.\nJapan's male world champions rarely risk their titles outside of their country. Apart from non-Japanese nationals, the thirteen champions did it, and the only four among them successfully defended their titles. That is because Japan's professional boxing has given priority to holding the fights in their own country to get paid television broadcast rights fees. Consequently, Japan's champions still remain internationally unrecognized. The broadcast rights fees have decreased under the economic downturn.\nRecognition Issues.\nJapanese boxers have very low recognition in the United States as cable networks are generally unconcerned with the lower weight classes to which most of the Japanese boxers belong. In April 2012, \"The Ring\"'s Doug Fischer outlined the following three basic conditions that are required for Japan's boxing in order to earn international recognition:\nThe fight between the WBC's Kazuto Ioka and the WBA's Akira Yaegashi in June 2012 was the first-ever world title unification match for Japan's world champions. The president of Japan Pro Boxing Association Hideyuki Ohashi mentioned that it could be a healthy sign for the future of Japan's boxing. Prior to that, there have been two attempts to unify the world titles. However, in the fight between the WBA's Jirō Watanabe and the WBC's Payao Poontarat, Watanabe was stripped of his WBA title before the fight since he participated in that bout under the WBC rules without being sanctioned by the WBA. The chairman of the WBA's championship committee Elias Cordova had warned on the day of the fight stating that \"The minute he steps into the ring Watanabe will be stripped of his title.\" In the fight between the WBC's Hozumi Hasegawa and the WBO's Fernando Montiel, Montiel's WBO title was not at stake because the JBC had recognized only the WBA, WBC and its co-founder OPBF as legitimate governing organizations sanctioning championship bouts and had not allowed their boxers to fight for the other organizations' titles.\nWBO and IBF.\nOn February 28, 2011, the JBC permitted them only when a Japan's reigning world titleholder of the WBA and/or WBC was going to fight in a title unification match against a world champion of the WBO and/or IBF. However, at that time, even if a Japan's champion won, he had to vacate the newer WBO and/or IBF title after a fixed period, and a defense match for the newer title was not authorized.\nThe JBC announced that they would join the WBO and the IBF on April 1, 2013. Although they still do not recognize the international title and regional titles, the JBC decided to allow their boxers to fight for any world titles of the four major sanctioning bodies.\nBoxing fatalities.\nFrom 1950 through 2011, Tokyo was the city with the most boxing fatalities in the world. After the JBC's inception in April 1952, thirty-eight Japanese professional boxers died from fight injuries. In 1973, one boxer among them died after an eighth-round knockout loss in a super featherweight ten-round bout in Agana, Guam. He is the only Japanese boxer to die outside of his home country.\nThere were six fatal accidents before that. First, an African American died of athlete's heart after an exhibition match in Yokohama in 1902. The first Japanese fatality was the former national lightweight champion, Nobuo Kobayashi. He never regained consciousness after a ninth-round technical knockout loss at the Koshien tennis court in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo in 1930.\nAfter the year 1952, five Japanese amateur boxers and two Thai professional boxers died due to a fight in Japan. In addition, one Japanese amateur boxer died of cerebral hemorrhage after the test for a professional boxer's license, and one Japanese professional boxer suffered a fatal cerebral hemorrhage during a sparring session. The thirty-eighth victim under the JBC's professional regulations and rules, and the fifty-third in total, died of subdural hematoma seventeen days after his first professional bout against another debutant."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Pakistan in 1982–83",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured Pakistan in September and October 1982 to play three Tests and a two-match One Day International series. Pakistan won the Test series 3–0, and one day series 2–0. Australia failed to win a single game on the entire tour.\nIn the words of \"Wisden\", \"The Australians proved ill-equipped to cope with a Pakistan side beginning to exert its international authority under the leadership of Imran Khan... For Pakistan it was the country's finest cricketing hour. Their three-nil Test victory was unprecedented in a short series there... It all amounted to a tour to rank among the most dismal ever made by an Australian side.\"\nPeter McFarline of \"The Age\" wrote \"on a ratio of defeats to games, the 1982 Australians in Pakistan have been this country's worst national team.\"\nAustralia's wicketkeeper on the tour, Rod Marsh, later wrote that \"the more you think of the 1982 Australian cricket tour of Pakistan the more you want to forget it.\"\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just defeated Pakistan 2–1 at home during the 1981–82 summer season and several of the players had previously toured Pakistan.\nCaptain Greg Chappell and fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe who had all just toured New Zealand were all unavailable for selection on the tour. Chappell was replaced as captain by Kim Hughes, his vice-captain, despite the fact that many observers felt the more experienced Rod Marsh should have gotten the job. Hughes had led Australia to defeat on tours of India (1979) and England (1981).\nThe Australian squad announced on 26 March 1982 was:\nRick Darling was overlooked despite having scored over 1,000 first class runs that summer. However Ritchie had made 836 runs at 59.5 and Phillips had scored 857 runs at 47.6. John Inverarity (30 wickets at 21.6), Jim Higgs (29 wickets at 39.3) and Bob Holland (27 wickets at 24) had taken more wickets as spinners than Sleep (22 at 33) or Bright (20 at 37) at first class level that summer but were not taken. Ian Callen had not toured with Australia since he went to the West Indies in 1978 but had taken 31 wickets over the 1981–82 summer.\nRod Marsh refused to serve as vice captain under Kim Hughes, saying he wanted \"to give a younger player the experience of being vice-captain.\" He was replaced by Border.\nThe selection panel on tour was Hughes, Border and Laird. \"Wisden\" later reported \"it seemed that Kim Hughes had a strong and well-balanced team under his command.\" Hughes thought the team was in better shape than the squad which lost to Pakistan in 1980:\nWe struggled before, but the spinning combination of Ray Bright and Bruce Yardley, the left- and right-arm orthodox bowlers, gives us a better balance and makes me optimistic of winning the series... But I'm not underestimating our quicks. Jeff Thomson can get us into a winning position if the wickets allow. But he may not be able to get amongst them on the final day and our spinners will have to knock them over.\nHughes would be facing Imran Khan as Pakistan captain. \"\"I have a healthy respect for Imran\", said Hughes. \"He is fiercely competitive but fair.\"\nPreparations.\nCol Egar flew to Pakistan in July in order to help plan the tour.\nThe team met for four days in Perth for a training camp on 4 September. Kim Hughes said he was pleased with the squad:\nPakistan are in the process of developing one of their best sides ever and they seem to be able to bat well down the order... The boys will have to handle a different diet, customs and outlook on life — but it will be worth it... Sleep and Yardley have been to India and that should stand them in good stead... In the spin department we have the great balance of a left-arm orthodox in Ray Bright and a right arm exponent in Yardley... The five regular batsmen, Border, Dyson, Bruce Laird, Graeme Wood and myself have seen a lot of cricket, and Ritchie and Phillips will be given every chance to be considered for the Tests.\nThere had been criticism of Pakistan pitches over the years. The curator of the WACA ground, John Maley, went to Pakistan in 1981 to advise the Board of Cricket Control on making of wickets. Maley found some suitable soil and recommended that the Test strips in Karachi, Faisalabad and Lahore be dug up and relaid.\nTour.\nThe team left Perth on 9 September and travelled via Singapore to Karachi before flying to Rawalpindi. Rod Marsh stayed behind a few days to help his small child recover from an illness.\nBCCP Patron's XI v Australians at Rawalpindi, 12–14 September 1982.\nAustralia's first tour game was against the BCCP Patrons XI. Wayne Phillips played as wicketkeeper because of Marsh's unavailability, and Australia decided to play three spinners, Sleep, Bright and Yardley.\nAustralia began well in the first innings, making 9-327 with a century from Kim Hughes, and half centuries from Graeme Wood and Allan Border. Hughes brought up his century with a six off the last over of the day.\nHowever Australia's bowlers struggled to dismiss the opposition, who declared at 5-424, with contributions from Masood Anwar (125), Mansoor Akhtar (130) and Haroon Rasheed (94); Yardley's figures were 2-136. A second innings collapse saw Australia come close to losing the game, falling to 5-82 before recovering to 8-166 at close of play. It ended in a draw.\nBCCP XI v Australians at Multan, 16–18 September 1982.\nAustralia fared much better in the next tour game, against BCCP XI, where they almost forced a victory. Wood, Hughes and Greg Ritchie both scored half centuries in Australia's first innings total of 277. BCCP XI went from 0-96 to all out for 177, with Ray Bright and Geoff Lawson picking up five wickets each. Australia responded with 3-124 (Hughes opening made 43) then declared. The BCCP XI were 4-67 at close of play. Ritchie's first innings score of 59 put him in contention for test selection.\n1st ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Hyderabad (Sind), Sep 20, 1982.\nAustralia travelled to Hyderabad to play Pakistan in a one-day international. It was the first such game Australia had played in Pakistan. The locals were led by Zaheer Abbas in the absence of Imran Khan, who had a side strain. It was the first one-day match Australia had played in Pakistan. Australia played five batsmen (Wood, Laird, Hughes, Border, Dyson) and five bowlers (Thomson, Yardley, Lawson, Alderman and Ian Callen – the latter playing his first international for Australia since 1978).\nThe crowd of 30,000 was 5,000 more than capacity. About 3,000 police were on duty, many using riot shields, and extra security was implemented as the match went on. A two-metre high steel fence with tipped lances had been erected around the playing area at a cost of A$30,000.\nHughes won the toss and elected to bowl. Mohsin Khan put on 83 with Mudassar Nazar. During Pakistan's innings, some crowd members ran on to the pitch and some Australian players had to defend themselves from what reports described as \"enthusiastic mobbing\". Kim Hughes had to push away one persistent youth who rolled over on the ground to the cheers of the crowd. When Graeme Wood caught Zaheer Abbas for 26 off Bruce Yardley, large numbers of the crowd passed through loopholes in the fence and charged on to the field, making for Mohsin Khan who was then on 97. Police and officials took five minutes to chase them off using batons and staves. Moshin went on to make a century, prompting another pitch invasion by a youth who attempted to garland him and Allan Border, fielding at square leg. The Australian manager, Col Egar, protested and it was announced soon after noon that the teams would return to Karachi if any further disturbances occurred. The game resumed and Pakistan ended with 6-229 off 40 overs. The crowd continually threw stones at police and during the break, one youth impaled himself on the fence and was taken away for treatment.\nIn response, Wood and Bruce Laird took Australia to 0-104 off 23 overs before a collapse resulted in them being dismissed for 9-170. Tauseef Ahmed took three wickets and Imran's replacement, Jalal-ud-Din took a hat-trick consisting of Marsh, Yardley and Lawson off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of his seventh over.\n1st Test: Pakistan v Australia at Karachi, Sep 22-27, 1982.\nAustralia's team for the first test was Wood, Laird, Dyson, Border, Hughes, Greg Ritchie (making his test debut), Bruce Yardley, Ray Bright, Jeff Thomson and Geoff Lawson. Geoff Lawson was picked over Terry Alderman who was made 12th man.\nPakistan's team was Mohsin Khan, Mansoor Akhtar, Haroon Rasheed, Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Mudassar Nazar, Imran Khan, Tahir Naqquah, Wasim Bari, Abdul Qadir and Iqbal Qasim.\nHughes won the toss and decided to bat. There were 3-202, with good innings from Dyson (87) and Hughes (54) when Australia lost two quick wickets – Hughes and Ritchie. Rod Marsh later wrote these two wickets meant \"we probably lost the entire series in just half an hour on the first day of the first test.. it was just what the Pakistanis needed and just what we didn't. They came out next day and skittled us with the new ball. Had we got through that crisis time and resumed with only three down, it might have been a new ball game, a new series.\" \"Wisden\" reported that \"Australia's 218 for five at the close of the first day was inadequate considering the excellent conditions.\" Australia were dismissed for 284 with Border 55 not out.\nPakistan made 419 in response, with the Australians dropping key catches. Zaheer Abbas, for instance, was dropped at nine, 61 and 80 and made 91.\n\"We lost concentration with the interruptions, dropped catches, but the bowlers, particularly the pacemen, Jeff Thomson and Geoff Lawson, were magnificent\", said Kim Hughes. \"Not once did they knock back a spell but just kept going.\"\nThe \"interruptions\" were serious. Items being thrown on the ground – including stones, potatoes and onions – led to Hughes taking his side off the ground on two separate occasions on the third day – one for 14 minutes, one for 25 minutes.\nHughes said, \"We should have gone off earlier, but I was sorry for the umpires and the other people who had paid good money to see cricket.\"\nSikander Bakht, a Pakistani paceman not playing in the Test, said the local players were used to this behaviour. \"But I don't blame the Australians for going off\", he said.\nHughes later threatened to call off the tour if any of his players were injured.\nI'm not going to let my fellows* heads be cut open by razor-sharp stones... This is an insult to the Australian players – we are being treated like animals in a zoo... We should have gone off earlier, but I was sorry for the umpires and the other people who had paid good money to see cricket... We are here to play cricket and are being treated like animals. No wonder other cricketing countries are loath to come here. What bothers me is what happens when we are in a winning position? The same treatment was handed out to the West Indians. We can take the verbal abuse, but I've reached a position where our blokes don't want to field at fine leg.\nThe Karachi commissioner went with local cricket-association officials to plead with the rioters and were met with a hail of stones, vegetables and water bombs. Appeals were made in Urdu to keep calm in an almost non-stop use of the public-address system throughout the afternoon. \"Pakistan is in a strong position : don't worry the batsmen\", pleaded the announcer.\nHughes was still positive, saying \"If our second-innings batsmen put in three-quarters of the effort of Thommo and Henry, we should save the day. It's still a good wicket and if we can hold them to 100 ahead, we are still in it.\"\nAustralia collapsed in their second innings, making 179, with no Australian batsman making more than 32. Abdul Qadir took 5-76, Iqbal Qasim 2-48. Qadir won the game with a spell of 5-44 from 20 overs after the fourth day, including Dyson, Wood and Border in 18 deliveries for six runs.\nPakistan scored the 47 required to win with the loss of only one wicket.\n\"But for some appallingly sloppy fielding, we may have made quite a game of the first test\", wrote Marsh later. \"Geoff Lawson and Jeff Thomson did everything anyone could expect of them, but were badly let down by dropped catches. If we'd held those chances, it may have been a different story.\"\n2nd Test: Pakistan v Australia at Faisalabad, Sep 30-Oct 5, 1982.\nPakistan kept the same side for the second test. Australia replaced an ill Bruce Yardley with Peter Sleep.\nPakistan batted first and scored 6-501 declared, despite good bowling from Geoff Lawson (4-97). Mudssas and Moshin put on 123 for the opening partnership. Zaheer Abbas made 126 after being dropped on 57; Akhtr made 111. \"Wisden\"said Lawson's bowling \"was an effort of sustained pace and fortitude.\"\nAustralia then wilted under the bowling of Qadir (4-76) and Qasim (2-28) making 168, Wood top scoring with 49.\nImran enforced the follow on and his bowlers dismissed Australia for 330 with the spinners taking nine of the wickets – Qadir 7-142 and Qasim 2-91. The one bright spot for Australia was Ritchie's second innings century, 106 not out; Laird made 60.\nGeoff Lawson complained about being given out leg before wicket, resulting in an official complaint from the umpire.\nCol Egar worried if the team had inadequate preparation:\nThe boys have come out of a six-month layoff, started their per sonal physical fitness programs in ,\nJuly, had four days in Perth, two under match conditions on the WACA ground, and then were flung into a totally different world against a national side at the top of their playing abilities after an England tour. The only opportunity to tour was now, but we arc meeting the conscquences of our decision... The Australian batting performance yesterday let down the fielding effort on the previous day, as well as the courage of Lawson with the ball. The bats men read too much into the wicket and gave the advantage to the Pakistan bowling. When we began it seemed that we could get 350 at least, but the dismissals of Bruce Laird and John Dyson were vital and from an umpiring viewpoint, unfortunate.\n2nd ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Lahore, Oct 8, 1982.\nAustralia decided on an all-pace attack for the second one-day international, trusting the bowling to Thomson, Lawson, Alderman and Ian Callen. Allan Border was the fifth bowler. Pakistan made 3-234, with Zaheer Abbas scoring 109 and Javed Miandad 61. Australia made 4-204 in response, Laird carrying his bat with 91 not out and Kim Hughes scoring 64 off 67 runs. \"Wisden\" wrote that \"there was almost an inevitability about Pakistan's advance to victory, despite the temporary abandonment of the antiquated scoreboard by the scorers and a stand of 117 between Laird and Hughes in 74 minutes... Laird was three hours making 91 not out when Australia desperately needed more positive strokeplay.\"\nZaheer Abbas was named man of the match.\nPakistan Invitation XI v Australians at Sialkot, Oct 10-12, 1982.\nAustralia played a tour game against a Pakistan Invitation XI. Wayne Phillips and Ian Callen joined the team, Phillips doubling as wicketkeeper and opener.\nThe first day was washed out. Australia batted first and made 4-283, Phillips top scoring 92 and Dyson making 71. Pakistan Invitational XI were 7-169 not out at close, Bright taking three wickets.\n3rd Test: Pakistan v Australia at Lahore, Oct 14-19, 1982.\nFor the third test, Australia decided to drop Sleep and Bright and use a three-man pace attack in conjunction with Yardley, recalling Terry Alderman to support Geoff Lawson and Jeff Thomson. Wayne Phillips was 12th man.\nAccording to press reports, \"Hughes gave a do-or-die talk to the team\" before the test, \"but it may yet prove to be\nas futile as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\"\nAustralia batted first and scored 316, due to late order knocks from Lawson (57) and Yardley (40). Imran Khan took 4-45. Pakistan made 7-467 in response. Javed Miandad was dropped three times, once on 9 before making 138. Mohsin Khan scored 135.\nJeff Thomson kicked down the stumps on the second day after umpire Shakoor Rana had no-balled him. The umpire spoke to the bowler and then to Hughes. After several more no-balls had upset Thomson, he was taken out of the attack. \"It was most unThomsonlike behaviour and I'm sure he regretted it as soon as he'd done it\", wrote Marsh. \"But he'd had enough of Pakistan. We all had.\"\nBy stumps on the fourth day Australia were 3-66. Dyson made 51 and Hughes batted for three hours making 39 but they were dismissed for 214. Pakistan won by nine wickets. It was the first time Australia had lost every test in a series in the subcontinent\nAccording to one report, \"The out-of-touch Australians have struggled throughout this disappointing tour, made out of season, to honour a commitment. Reputations have gone by the board as batsmen and bowlers have floundered, and most of the team have been out of action at some time with stomach complaints and other virus infections.\"\nCol Egar told the press:\nWe are battling against the odds – that's not a gutless situation. We are suffering from lack of practice before the tour, our batting lacks timing, we have gone on the defensive and negative cricket breeds dismissal. The bowlers arc short of lead-up match practice and let's face it, we are playing against a powerful side. I will certainly recommend to the Australian Cricket Board that we don't tour again out of season. We will have to make sure we come here in 1988 at the end of the Sheffield Shield season.\nImran Khan was man of the match. Geoff Lawson was Australia's man of the series and Abdul Qadir was Pakistan's.\n3rd ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Karachi, Oct 22, 1982.\nAustralia's team for the 3rd ODI saw Ian Callen return to the Australian side (replacing Ray Bright – Australia went for an all pace attack) and Wayne Phillips made his ODI debut as an opener.\nFifteen minutes into the game Geoff Lawson was seen throwing a stone back into the crowd while fielding at long leg. Hughes and the umpires spoke to him and after lengthy conversations, and a plea from Hughes to the stands for calm, decided to carry on. However items continued to be thrown from the stands. When Pakistan were 1-39, Lawson was hit on the leg, and Hughes led his players from the field. For almost an hour Hughes discussed possibly abandoning the game with Imran, managers and officials, but eventually, at the urging of Australian manager Col Egar, the Australians decided to return.\nWithin an over, Pakistan were 1-44. Items began being thrown again and Greg Ritchie was hit. Hughes led his team from the field, this time for good. The Australians were evacuated from the stadium, then it was announced the game was abandoned. The crowd turned on the police, attacking them with stones and seats ripped up from the stands, and setting light to the canvas awnings used as protection from the sun. The police responded with baton charges and tear gas. The conflict spilled into the streets surrounding the stadium. Rioters even prevented fire engines from reaching the ground.\nPakistan authorities used volunteers at the stadium instead of police, keeping police in reserve. \"If the authorities are too frightened to use police inside the ground then we are too frightened to play cricket\", said Col Egar.\nRod Marsh later said he \"asked around and people in the know said the mob had nothing against us personally. No, they were protesting because they wanted a new grandstand built at the ground. They've a funny way of expressing themselves in Pakistan.\"\nAustralia flew home via Singapore from Karachi on the morning of 23 October 1982. They were seen off at the airport by their liaison officer, Talat Ali.\nSummary.\nThe series was seen as a triumph for Pakistan, who played without Sarfraz Nawaz. Imran Khan and Abdul Qadir bowled particularly well, with the latter taking 22 wickets, a record for a series against Australia. According to Wisden:\nHis remarkable dexterity, variety and accuracy, usually exploited from round the wicket, to find boot marks at the other end, caused the Australians such difficulties that it made his absence from the team which had visited Australia the previous summer all the more inexplicable. His success was achieved, moreover, against batsmen who prided themselves on their ability to cope with the ball tossed into the air and turning from leg. Qadir's ability to turn the ball sharply in both directions eroded the Australians' patience and confidence and frustrated their desires to advance down the pitch to get the better of him.\nQadir received strong support from Iqbal Qasim and together they took 30 of the 56 Australian wickets to fall to bowlers in the three Tests. Pakistan also batted particularly well, especially openers Mohsin Khan and Mudassar Nazar, with strong support from Zaheer Abbas, Mansoor Akhtar, and Javed Miandad.\n\"They played very good cricket\", wrote Marsh. \"Percentage cricket.\"\nPeter McFarline wrote \"It is not unfair to say that there must now be question marks besides the name of Graeme Wood, Bruce Laird, indeed Hughes and Allan Border as well as bowlers Jeff Thomson, Bruce Yardley and Ray Bright.\" (Laird would never play cricket for Australia again.)\n\"Wisden\" called fast bowler Geoff Lawson \"the outstanding Australian... his spirit was undaunted by the failures of his fellow players, and he remained the one bowler to trouble the Pakistanis in all conditions throughout the series.\" Australia's spinners only took six test wickets between them, although Australia did drop fifteen catches throughout the series. \"It all amounted to a tour to rank among the most dismal ever made by an Australian side\", said \"Wisden\".\n\"It is almost too painful to recall what happened to us on the field in Pakistan\", wrote Rod Marsh. \"We thought like losers, we played like losers. And we lost everything we attempted.\"\nRod Marsh later claimed to have lived off Australian beer and canned fruit that was shipped into the country. He says players amused themselves by watching in-house television movies and setting off fireworks.\nControversies.\nRiots in the crowd caused Kim Hughes to twice lead the Australian team from the field during the first test, and also to abandon the third one-day international.\nKim Hughes wanted to continue to captain Australia full-time. However Greg Chappell was reappointed Australian captain for the 1982–83 Ashes.\nIn October 1982 Ian Chappell wrote \"maybe the Australian Cricket Board will now believe me when I say: 'Kim Hughes isn't the best man for the job of Australian captain'. Because of the Board's unwillingness to back down and admit that a decision it made in 1979 was wrong, the Australian team has been made to suffer a number of disasters that could be avoided. Hughes, along with Graham Yallop, has done for Australian captaincy what Mrs. Miller did for female vocalists in the 1960s. The time has come for the board to swallow its pride, thank Hughes for his efforts, and start grooming for Allan Border to take over from Greg Chappell.\"\nChappell did think the form of Geoff Lawson and Greg Ritchie were two positives but thought the \"biggest disappointment\" was the performance of Peter Sleep and felt Stuart Saunders may be in the running the play England. Chappell wrote \"all in all, Pakistan has not quite been the disaster it first appears in the record books, except if your name is Kim Hughes.\""

        "text": "Matthew Glen Davidson (born March 26, 1991) is an American professional baseball infielder for the NC Dinos of the KBO League. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.\nCareer.\nDavidson attended Yucaipa High School in Yucaipa, California. He committed to attend the University of Southern California (USC) on a scholarship to play college baseball for the USC Trojans baseball team. After graduating from high school, the Arizona Diamondbacks selected Davidson in the first round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. Davidson signed with the Diamondbacks, forgoing his college commitment.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nDavidson appeared in 72 games in 2009 for the Yakima Bears. In 2010, Davidson played for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the Single–A Midwest League, and hit 16 home runs. He was promoted to the Visalia Rawhide of the High–A California League later that season. Prior to the 2011 season, Davidson was ranked as the 99th best prospect by Baseball America. He played for Visalia in 2011. Prior to 2012, he was ranked 97th. That year, he played for the Mobile BayBears of the Double–A Southern League.\nDavidson began the 2013 season with the Reno Aces of the Triple–A Pacific Coast League. He appeared in the All-Star Futures Game in 2013, and was named the game's most valuable player after he hit a go-ahead two-run home run. A day later, he won the 2013 Triple-A Home Run Derby, hitting 11 home runs across the three rounds, including seven in the first round, to surpass Brock Peterson's 10. The Diamondbacks promoted Davidson to the major leagues on August 11, 2013. He debuted that night with a 1-for-3 performance as an injury substitute for Cody Ross.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn December 16, 2013, the Diamondbacks traded Davidson to the Chicago White Sox for pitcher Addison Reed. He played for the Charlotte Knights of the Triple–A International League in 2014 and 2015. He began the 2016 season with Charlotte and was promoted to the major leagues on June 30, 2016. In his first game with the White Sox, he fractured his foot.\nOn April 6, 2017, Davidson hit his first career-triple at his first at-bat since breaking his foot in 2016 against the Detroit Tigers. He hit his first home-run for the White Sox, a three-run blast in the fourth inning. He finished the game logging two hits, two runs, and three RBIs.\nOn June 13, 2017, Davidson hit his first-career Grand Slam against the Baltimore Orioles with the Chicago White Sox. For the season, he had the highest strikeout percentage among major leaguers against right-handed pitchers (39.9%).\nOn 2018 Opening Day against the Kansas City Royals on March 29, 2018, Davidson hit three home runs. Davidson became just the fourth player in Major League Baseball History to hit three home runs in a single game on opening day. The White Sox won 14–7.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn February 7, 2019, Davidson signed a minor league contract with the Texas Rangers. He was assigned to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds for the 2019 season, hitting .264/.325/.527/.852 with 33 home runs and 101 RBI. He became a free agent following the 2019 season.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn January 2, 2020, Davidson signed a minor league deal with the Cincinnati Reds. On July 24, 2020, Davidson had his contract selected to the 40-man roster, and same day, he was the starting designated hitter, making his Reds debut on Opening Day against the Detroit Tigers. But on July 25, 2020, he placed the 10-day injured list for his testing positive for COVID-19. The test ended up being a false positive. On September 30, 2020, Davidson was selected back to the 40-man roster. On October 14, 2020, Davidson was outrighted off of the 40-man roster. Davidson elected free agency two days later on October 16.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn February 16, 2021, Davidson signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization that included an invitation to Spring Training. He spent the entire season with the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers, where he hit .294 in 84 games with 28 home runs and 81 RBI.\nArizona Diamondbacks (second stint).\nOn November 22, 2021, Davidson signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks, and on April 21, 2022, his contract was purchased from the minor leagues by the Diamondbacks. Davidson appeared in 5 games for Arizona, going 1-for-10 with 3 walks. He was designated for assignment on May 2, when active rosters shrunk from 28 to 26.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn May 9, 2022, Davidson signed a minor league deal with the Oakland Athletics and was assigned to the Triple-A Las Vegas Aviators. On June 7, Davidson was selected to the active roster. He appeared in 8 games, going 4-for-24 with one home run and 2 RBI. Davidson was designated for assignment on June 21. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Triple-A Las Vegas the next day. He elected free agency on October 6, 2022.\nHiroshima Toyo Carp.\nOn November 17, 2022, Davidson signed with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball. He made his NPB debut on March 31, 2023. The next day, he became the first non-Japanese player for the Carp to hit a home run as his first NPB hit since Xavier Batista in 2017. On April 28, Davidson hit a home run that hit a Kirin Beer billboard above the left field seats at the Tokyo Dome. The feat earned him one million Japanese yen and one year worth of Kirin Beer, which he said he would distribute among his teammates. In 112 games for the Carp, Davidson batted .210/.273/.425 with 19 home runs and 44 RBI. On November 16, the Carp announced that they would not give Davidson a contract for the 2024 season, and he became a free agent.\nNC Dinos.\nOn January 11, 2024, Davidson signed a one–year, $1 million contract with the NC Dinos of the KBO League.\nPersonal.\nDavidson and his wife, Julianne, have two children: a daughter who was born November 2014, and a son born July 2016. It was announced on July 25, 2020, that Davidson had tested (false) positive for COVID-19 one day after starting in the season opener."

They were led by fourth-year head coach Sean Miller and played home games at McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona as members of the Pac-12 Conference.\nSeeded 6th in the West Region of the 2013 NCAA tournament, the team defeated (11) Belmont and (14) Harvard by a combined score of 40 points before losing 73–70 to (2) Ohio State in the Sweet Sixteen.\nAfter starting the season undefeated in non-conference play the team went 12–6 in conference and fell to UCLA in the Pac-12 tournament semifinals. The team's mid-season record of 14–0 was the second best start in program history since the 1931–32 team opened the season 16–0.\nArizona entered the season ranked 11th in the Coaches and 12th in the AP preseason polls, climbed to 3rd in both after going undefeated into January, and then fell to 20th (Coaches) and 21st (AP) just prior to the start of the NCAA tournament.\nBefore the season began Sean Miller and his staff recruited the nation's 3rd-ranked class of 2012 and brought in three well-regarded transfers, among them starting point guard Mark Lyons, who led the team in scoring with 15.6 points-per-game, including 24.3 points-per-game in NCAA tournament play.\nPreseason.\nSummer Exhibition Tour.\nPractices began earlier than otherwise allowed by the NCAA in preparation for a six-day foreign tour to the Bahamas in August. (NCAA rules allow teams to conduct 10 practices in preparation for a foreign tour.) Although NCAA rules allow for foreign tours once every four years, the Bahamas tour was Arizona's first since 2006. It was the seventh in program history. The team won its games 136–66 and 99–57.\nRed-Blue Game.\nArizona's annual pre-season Red-Blue scrimmage took place at McKale Center on October 21, selling out for the second-straight season. A half-time ceremony celebrated the 25-year anniversary of the 1987-88 basketball team, the first in program history to reach the Final Four. The team's 35 victories remain the most in school history. Members of the team present included Tucson-native Sean Elliott, Arizona's all-time leading scorer, with 2,555 career points; Steve Kerr, whose 57.8% three-point field-goal percentage in the 1987–88 season is the best in NCAA history (with a minimum of 100 shots made); and Anthony Cook, who recorded a program-best 278 career blocked-shots.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#;\"| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Las Cruces bowling alley massacre",
        "text": "The Las Cruces bowling alley massacre occurred in Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States, on February 10, 1990. Seven people were shot, five fatally, by two unidentified robbers at the Las Cruces Bowling Alley at 1201 East Amador Avenue. The gunmen shot the victims in an office, then set fire to a desk in the room and left the scene. The case is unsolved.\nThe incident is one of the two deadliest mass shootings in New Mexico history, the other being the 2013 South Valley homicides, which also resulted in the deaths of five people.\nShooting.\nOn the morning of February 10, 1990, the bowling alley's manager, 34-year-old Stephanie C. Senac, was in her office preparing to open the business with her 12-year-old daughter Melissa Repass and Melissa's 13-year-old friend Amy Houser, who were planning to supervise the alley's day care. The alley's cook, Ida Holguin, was in the kitchen when two men entered through an unlocked door. One pulled a .22 caliber pistol on Holguin and ordered her into Senac's office, where she, Repass, and Houser were already being held by the other gunman.\nThe gunmen ordered the women and children to lie down while taking approximately $4,000 to $5,000 from the bowling alley's safe. Soon after, Steve Teran, the alley's 26-year-old pin mechanic, entered. As Teran had been unable to find a babysitter for his two daughters—two-year-old Valerie Teran and six-year-old Paula Holguin (no relation to Ida)—he intended to drop them off at the alley's day care. Not seeing anyone in the alley, Teran entered Senac's office and stumbled onto the crime scene. The gunmen then shot all seven victims multiple times at point-blank range. They then set the office on fire by igniting some papers before leaving the alley.\nThe bowling alley fire was reported at 8:33am. Officers responding to the call discovered that Amy Houser, Paula Holguin, and Steven Teran had died at the scene. Valerie Teran was rushed to a hospital, but declared dead on arrival. Repass, despite being shot five times, called 9-1-1 on the office phone, allowing emergency services to respond immediately and saving her life along with her mother's and Ida Holguin's. However, Senac died in 1999 due to complications from her injuries.\nPolice set up ten roadblocks surrounding Las Cruces within an hour of the shooting, and carefully screened anyone leaving the city. The U.S. Customs Service, Army and Border Patrol searched the area with planes and helicopters, but no arrests were made.\nInvestigation.\nThe case remains unsolved, but is still under active investigation by the Las Cruces Police Department .\nIn 2016, 26 years after the shooting, a brother of victim Steven Teran (who died in the shooting), Anthony Teran, was included in an issue of the \"Las Cruces Sun-News\" newspaper. One of his remarks was noted, \"In this day and age, things like this don’t go unsolved. How did we not get these guys? That’s the question I ask myself every day. Numerous people saw these gunmen, so someone out there knows something, and they need to come forward.\"\nAuthorities are now trying to build a DNA profile from evidence found at the scene.\nIn popular culture.\nMovies.\nA full-length documentary film called \"A Nightmare in Las Cruces\" was released on the 20th anniversary of the massacre. It uses actual crime scene video, pictures and interviews with family members. Filmmaker Charlie Minn hopes it will \"move someone to come forward with fresh information and break the case.\" Since its release, more tips have been reported to the local police.\nTV crime informational series.\nThis case was featured on \"Unsolved Mysteries\" two and a half months after the murders, and on \"America's Most Wanted\" three times, once in March 1995, again in November 2004, and once again in March 2010.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis case was featured on podcast Detective Perspective on November 27, 2023 by former police detective and investigator, Derrick Levasseur.

        "title": "List of people who died climbing Mount Everest",
        "text": " \nOver 330 people have died attempting to reach—or return from—the summit of Mount Everest which, at , is Earth's highest mountain and a particularly desirable peak for mountaineers. This makes it the mountain with the most deaths, although it does not have the highest death rate. The most recent years without known deaths on the mountain are 1977, in which only two people reached the summit, and 2020, when permits were suspended by Nepal because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDeaths have been attributed to avalanches, falls, serac collapse, exposure, frostbite, or health problems related to conditions on the mountain. Not all bodies have been located, so details on those deaths are not available.\nThe upper reaches of the mountain are in the death zone, a mountaineering term for altitudes above a certain point – around , or less than of atmospheric pressure – where the oxygen pressure level is not sufficient to sustain human life. Many deaths in high-altitude mountaineering have been caused by the effects of the death zone, either directly (loss of vital functions) or indirectly (unwise decisions made under stress or physical weakening leading to accidents). In the death zone, the human body cannot acclimatize, as it uses oxygen faster than it can be replenished. An extended stay in the zone without supplementary oxygen will result in deterioration of bodily functions, loss of consciousness, and death.\nBackground.\nDuring the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition, two people died en route to the mountain: an unidentified porter and heart attack victim A. M. Kellas. The first recorded deaths on the mountain itself were seven porters who perished in an avalanche in the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition.\nIn 1996, 12 people died trying to reach the summit, the most in a single year to that date. The number reflects the large number of climbers that year rather than a spike in the death rate: before 1996, one in four climbers died making the ascent, while in 1996, one in seven died. But it also includes the 1996 Mount Everest disaster on May 11, 1996, during which eight people died due to a blizzard while making summit attempts. Among them was guide Rob Hall, the first non-Sherpa to have summitted five times. Two books detailing the disaster, \"Into Thin Air\" by Jon Krakauer and \"The Climb\" by Anatoli Boukreev, both written by mountaineers who were on Mount Everest at the time, give conflicting accounts of the events.\nThe 1996 record was surpassed in the 2014, 2015 and 2023 seasons. There were few summits from the south in 2014 and none in 2015. On April 18, 2014, 16 Sherpas were killed in an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. On April 25, 2015, 19 people—the most ever in a single day on Everest—were killed in an avalanche at base camp after a 7.8 earthquake, which killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000 in Nepal. During the 2023 season, a total of 17 climbers died to and from the summit. Almost none of the deaths are related to one another.\nIn 2001, Babu Chiri Sherpa died from a fall near Camp II. He had climbed the mountain 10 times and spent 20 hours on the summit of Everest in 1999, then a new record. He also climbed to the summit twice in two weeks and held the record climbing time from base camp to summit of 16 hours and 56 minutes.\nIn 2019, 11 people died on Everest during a record season with a huge number of climbers. Videos shared on social media showed climbers waiting in long queues to advance up the mountain.\nDue to the difficulties and dangers in bringing bodies down, most who die on the mountain remain where they fall. Two Nepalese climbers died on October 24, 1984, while trying to recover the body of Hannelore Schmatz. In 1999, searchers for George Mallory's body found his and other bodies in the snow in a catchment basin near the peak.\nMelting glaciers are revealing bodies on Everest. The Nepalese government does clean-up efforts to remove trash left by climbers, and also recovers bodies along with these efforts. Four unidentified bodies were recovered in 2019.\nDeaths.\nInformation on of the people who died climbing Mount Everest are listed in the table below."

For the second time since the College World Series began in 1947, the series was not a true double elimination tournament. Instead, the winners of the two pools met in a single National Championship game. Texas came out of its pool with no losses. Wichita State came out of its pool with one loss. Wichita State defeated Texas in the Championship game. Because each team only had one loss, in the championships prior to 1988, the teams would have played a winner-take-all game for the championship. Therefore, when Texas lost the championship game, rather than play another game for the championship, Wichita State was crowned champion. This new format was adopted for television reasons for the final game. Later, the format was switched to a best of three series in 2003.\nBracket.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-Tournament Team.\nThe following players were members of the All-Tournament Team."

        "text": "Glasgow Golf Club, founded in May 1787, is the ninth oldest golf club in the world. It has changed location several times during its history, but has been based at Killermont in Bearsden since 21 May 1904. The club is unusual in also having a links course, at Gailes, near Irvine, on the Ayrshire coast, some 35 miles away.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in May 1787, the first golf club in the west of Scotland, and now the ninth oldest golf club in the world. Its first Secretary was Lawrence Craigie and it was presided over by Cpt. James Clark.\nIt was first established at Glasgow Green by 22 men, wealthy merchants and army officers, who would have obtained a permit for the playing of golf in this public space from the town council. The club met here between 1787 and 1794, at which point, active military service in the Napoleonic Wars reduced the number of available players below practical levels. Golf playing recommenced in 1809 and remained at Glasgow Green until 1835 despite some municipal drainage works making the location somewhat unpleasant for leisure activities.\nIn 1870, the club started to expand, initially at Queen's Park, but moving just four years later to Alexandra Park. There was one further move to Blackhill (in 1895) before the current course at Killermont was secured for private play. It was during this phase of the club's history that the Gailes Links, Irvine, Ayrshire were opened (19 May 1892).\nThe Killermont course is based in the grounds of the B-listed Georgian neoclassical style Killermont House, built in 1805 by the Campbell-Colquhoun family. It was leased for a 20-year period by Glasgow Golf Club in the autumn of 1903, and a permanent tenancy was agreed in 1922. A similar arrangement with the Colquhoun family is in place with Loch Lomond Golf Club, which has occupied Rossdhu House and the accompanying grounds at Luss since 1993. In 1924 the land on which the Gailes Links course lies was bought from the Duke of Portland.\nThe Killermont course does not encourage visitors (except for member's guests), but it is possible to play as a visitor on the Gailes course.\nCourse details.\nKillermont is a par-70, parkland course of , designed in 1904 by Old Tom Morris. The course was altered in 1924 by James Braid, lengthening some of the holes by moving tees further back from the greens and by adding and changing bunkers.\nGailes is a par-71, championship golf links of with heather-lined fairways. The current layout was designed by Willie Park Jnr in 1912. It is the only Open Championship Final Qualifying course in Scotland to be selected by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews from 2014 to 2017."

Russia maintained its dominance in the sport, as the team delivered a nearly perfect, complex choreography for another gold medal at its fourth consecutive Olympics, having received a powerful, composite score of 197.030 by the judges. Meanwhile, the Chinese squad resisted the challenge from Spain on a historical breakthrough to add a silver in the event with 194.010, edging the Spaniards out of the pool to accept the bronze for a total score of 193.120.\nEight teams competed, each consisting of eight swimmers (from a total team of nine swimmers). There was a single round of competition. Each team presents two routines: a technical routine and a free routine. The technical routine consists of twelve required elements, which must be completed in order and within a time of between 2 minutes 35 seconds and 3 minutes 5 seconds. The free routine has no restrictions other than time; this routine must last between 3 minutes 45 seconds and 4 minutes 15 seconds.\nFor each routine, the team is judged by two panels of five judges each. One panel is the technical jury, the other is the artistic jury. Each judge gives marks of between 0 and 10. The highest and lowest score from each panel are dropped, leaving a total of six scores which are then summed to give the routine's score. The scores of the two routines are then added to give a final score for the team"

It was due to be the final ICC Champions Trophy, to be replaced by the ICC World Test Championship in 2017, but in January 2014, it was instead confirmed by the ICC that a Champions Trophy tournament would take place in 2017, with the proposed Test Championship being cancelled.\nQualification.\nAs hosts, England qualified for the competition automatically; they were joined by the seven other highest-ranked teams in the ICC ODI Championship as of 21 August 2012.\nRules and regulations.\nThe 2013 ICC Champions Trophy was contested by eight teams, which were seeded and divided into two groups. Each team played every other team in its group once. Following the group stage, the top two teams from each group progressed to the semi-finals, where the winner of Group A played the runner-up of Group B and the winner of Group B played the runner-up of Group A.\nVenues.\nThree cities hosted the tournament's matches: London (at The Oval), Birmingham (at Edgbaston) and Cardiff (at Sophia Gardens, known as Cardiff Wales Stadium for the tournament).\nWarm-up matches.\nThe warm-up matches had rules that were slightly different from normal ODI matches, so they are not recognised as ODIs. A team could use up to 15 players in a match, but only 11 could bat or field in each innings.\nGroup stage.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nControversy.\nAustralian David Warner was suspended by Cricket Australia until the first Ashes Test after an altercation with English batsman Joe Root following Australia's loss to England.\nFormer England captain Bob Willis accused one English cricketer of tampering with the ball in order to aid reverse swing during their match against Sri Lanka. Umpire Aleem Dar changed the ball midway through Sri Lanka's innings, but England coach Ashley Giles denied the accusations, saying that Dar changed the ball because it had gone out of shape.\nPitch invasion incident.\nThe semi-final between India and Sri Lanka at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff saw individuals, possibly Tamil Youth activists, running onto the pitch with flags of Tamil Eelam and banners protesting against the Sri Lankan team playing in the United Kingdom. The first invasion occurred in the 50th over of the Sri Lanka innings, but the two interlopers were soon overpowered by the security staff. However, the second invasion saw at least six protesters run onto the field from various angles from the River Taff End of the ground.\nThe protests continued after the match had finished, and a fight broke out outside the ground between protesters and supporters in a manner similar to the earlier protests at a group stage game at The Oval. Later, hundreds of members of Britain's Tamil community held up the Sri Lankan team bus after the encounter and raised anti-Sri Lankan government slogans. No protests were shown to the Indian team and their bus left as scheduled.\nThe earlier protest at The Oval allegedly saw several Tamils being harassed by Sinhala cricket fans who were leaving the match.\nTeam of the Tournament.\nThe team of the tournament was announced by ICC on 28 June 2013. It was selected by a five-person selection panel that comprised Geoff Allardice (ICC General Manager – Cricket, and Chairman Event Technical Committee), Javagal Srinath (former India fast bowler and ICC Emirates Elite Panel match referee), Aleem Dar (ICC Emirates Elite Panel umpire), Scyld Berry (Wisden Editor from 2008-2011 and Sunday Telegraph correspondent) and Stephen Brenkley (correspondent of The Independent and Independent On Sunday).\nTeam of the Tournament (in batting order):"

        "text": "Jim Walker (born 10 February 1959) is a Scottish professional darts player who plays in Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) events.\nCareer.\nWalker became a PDC Pro Tour Card holder in January 2012 after qualifying through Q-School in Barnsley.\nWalker's best results on the PDC Pro Tour in the early part of 2012 were at the 2012 UK Open Qualifier 3 and Qualifier 5, where he reached the last 32 both times. These were enough to see him qualify for his first PDC major, the UK Open. There he beat James Richardson, before losing to Joe Cullen 2–9 in the last 64.\nWalker qualified for the first PDC European Tour event of 2012, held in Wiener Neustadt, Vienna. He played Ronnie Baxter in the last 64 and beat the world number 17 6–5, before being on the wrong end of a 6–5 scoreline to Dean Winstanley in the next round. He also qualified for three of the remaining four European Tour events, but lost in the first round on each occasion. His best result of 2012 came at the 10th Players Championship when he reached the last 16 by beating Nigel Heydon, Baxter and Roland Scholten, but then lost to Terry Jenkins 3–6. After his first year on the PDC tour, Walker was ranked world number 71.\nWalker finished 61st on the 2013 UK Open Order of Merit, meaning he would enter the tournament at the second round stage. He beat Michael Bushby 5–1, before losing 7–9 to Terry Jenkins. At the Austrian Darts Open Walker saw off Leon de Geus 6–1 but was then defeated 6–4 by Mervyn King in the second round. He played in 18 events during the rest of the season with the furthest he advanced being two last 32 defeats. Walker's tour status had now expired and he entered Q School once again to try to win his place back as he started 2014 78th in the rankings, well outside the top 64 who automatically remain. During the four days of the event he was a last 16 loser twice which helped him to finish inside the top 24 on the Q School Order of Merit to earn a fresh two-year tour card. His best results in 2014 were two last 32 defeats.\nIn May 2015, Walker had wins over Ian White, Prakash Jiwa and Tony Newell at the 10th Players Championship event to reach the last 16 of a PDC event for the second time in his career, where he narrowly lost 6–5 to Andrew Gilding.\nWalker won through to the last 16 of the sixth and seventh Players Championships in 2016, losing 6–4 to James Wade and 6–3 to Kevin Dowling respectively. He beat Maik Langendorf 6–3 at the International Darts Open, but was defeated 6–2 in the second round by Ian White.\nPersonal life.\nWalker originally comes from Dalbeattie, Scotland, where he started playing darts over 35 years ago in local leagues. In the late 1980s he joined the Fire Service and moved south of the border to Surrey, later moving to Leicestershire where he lives today. He is married to Lisa and has two children."

        "title": "Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre",
        "text": "The Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre is a public swimming pool complex located on the corner of High Street and Edgar Street, Glen Iris, Melbourne, Australia. Built in the 1960s by Australian architects Kevin Borland and Daryl Jackson, the Swimming Centre is considered to be a fine example of Brutalist architecture. Originally built in 1927 as a municipal swimming baths, the facilities were renovated in 1967 by Borland and Jackson to accommodate for higher swimming participation numbers. It is named in honour of Prime Minister Harold Holt, the local member of parliament (representing the Division of Higgins) until his apparent drowning death while the facility was under construction.\nMalvern Baths.\nIn 1924 the Malvern City Council voted to build the suburb's first Municipal Baths. The Education Department, who envisaged the implementation of the 'learn to swim' campaign, strongly supported the proposed location, a redundant tip site, on the corner of High Street and Edgar Street. Built at a cost of £10,476, the Malvern Baths was designed by the City Engineer, Barton Coutie. The baths included a wedge shaped pool and bathing boxes, and was designed using ideas gleaned from Coutie's examination of swimming pools in Harrow, London. The complex was officially opened by the Mayor Harry Wilmot in November 1927.\nNew ‘Swimming Centre’.\nIn 1966 the Malvern Council commissioned architects Kevin Borland and Daryl Jackson to design a new swimming complex, as the Municipal Baths had become declared 'inadequate and outmoded' by the early 1960s. Set to be named the City of Malvern Olympic Swimming Centre, the name was changed after the sudden death, by drowning, of Malvern's local member and Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt in December 1967. The name is cited as a \"perhaps unintentional\" example of Australian black humour. The Centre was opened by the Prime Minister, and new local member, John Gorton in March 1969. The new complex cost $600,000.\nIn 1988 the centre underwent a renovation with the additions of a hydrotherapy pool, spa, sauna and multi-purpose room for aerobics and yoga classes. Further works were undertaken in 1998 to improve pool operations and an upgrade of the filtration systems.\n2010 saw a $13 million redevelopment of the centre, expanding its new health and fitness facilities as well as its Aquatic areas. The Harold Holt Swim Centre has become one of Melbourne's most popular aquatic facilities with 400,000 visitors per year.\nArchitecture.\nThe Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre is considered to be among the most notable examples of Brutalist architecture. It is classified by the National Trust and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.\nInfluences.\nThe Harold Holt swim centre is categorized as a brutalist building by Stuart Harrison in the journal Architect Victoria, Summer 2003. Harrison talks about the complexity of the centre's siting that echoes contemporary interests far advanced for its time in the 1960s. He goes on to discuss the building as a merger between different architectural styles that create a factory like feel within a suburban area much like Edmond and Corrigan's 1978 St Joseph's Chapel, Box Hill, Victoria, Australia. Harrison believes that the Harold Holt centre's sophistication could be read beyond its stylistic categorization as Brutalist, relating the sports function of the building to ancient gladiators: \"Is it possible that Brutalism's usage for sports buildings is related to some sense of appropriateness to function? Sports as brutal, gladiatorial?\"\nFacilities.\nThe Harold Holt Swimming Centre sits on a site of approximately 207 x 57 metres and consists of several pools with varying functionality and use. The indoor training pool and learner's pool are setback 40 metres from the south end of the site. There is a terrace located just north of these pools, a change rooms located to the west of the pools and a kiosk located east of these pools. Wedged between pathways that run along the perimeter of the site is a wading pool beyond which is the main pool that is approximately 49 x 14 metres in size. The Centre also features a circular diving pool at the northern edge of the site.\nThe complex consists of five pools, including an Outdoor 50m pool and an Indoor 25m pool enclosed by a large glass walled building. The outdoor pool became the first heated pool in Victoria for year-round swimming. It was also the first pool in Australia designed to metric standards. The complex also houses a hydrotherapy pool, spa, sauna and multi-purpose room for aerobics and yoga classes, which were additions in 1988. In 1998 further works were undertaken to improve pool operations, including an indoor pool 'wet deck' and upgrade of the filtration systems.\nIn November 2010 the Harold Holt Swim Centre underwent a $13 million redevelopment phase. The centre now features new facilities such as the health club and three fitness studios hosting over 50 fitness classes per week. Aquatic areas were expanded to include a leisure pool with water features and learn to swim pool. The Harold Holt Swim Centre also has child care facilities."

        "title": "Warrandyte Cricket Club",
        "text": "Established in 1855, the Warrandyte Cricket Club is located in the eastern suburbs of Victoria, Australia, and is the 3rd oldest active cricket club in the state. Social games were played at the Recreation Reserve in Andersons Creek (now Warrandyte) against neighbouring suburbs until the club entered the Cameron Cricket Association, playing its first game in competition on 11 November 1905 against Christmas Hills. Season 2010/11 was the club's 100th in competition (taking into account war periods and club disputes), and during that time over 1,300 people have played in either juniors, seniors, women's or veterans grades. The club currently competes in the Ringwood and District Cricket Association (RDCA)\nHistory.\nCricket on the goldfields (1855 – 1904).\nIn February 1855, 4 years after gold was first discovered in the town, the noted early Victorian politician William Westgarth paid a visit to Warrandyte, or Anderson's Creek as the town was then frequently called. He described the village as a small mining camp stretched along about a mile of the riverbank. The number of miners did not exceed two hundred in all. A punt was established across this river, a Post Office was established, a Mining Warden was appointed, and the Lands Department has also got a map surveyed by Clement Hodgkinson which shows a ground used for cricket on the present site of the Recreation Ground.\nA number of pioneers of Warrandyte took a keen interest in cricket, but two in particular, Walter Charles Brackenbury and William Collins, stand out as founders of the game in Warrandyte. The earliest found match documentation was from 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who got five wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich mining claim almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused quite a stir in the Melbourne Argus when he found 12oz. of gold in a tub of quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which it is now the Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia. Anderson's Creek won a brilliant victory scoring 114 to their opponents 26 and 36.\nOn 15 June 1864, the club applied to the Government for a permanent recreation ground. Their petition was presented by the then Mining Warden Charles Warburton Carr, and the club was granted permissive occupancy, but this was not very suitable as they were worried that the ground might be used for building purposes, and a second petition was presented on behalf of the club by Mr. W.Watkins M.L.A. in 1866.\nA permanent recreation ground was then gazetted and the first trustees were appointed on 10 September 1866. They were Dr. John Elmes, Walter Pretty, William Collins, Arthur Liddlelow and Thomas Porteus. William Collins, who was a landscape gardener offered to give his services to beautify the ground, and in the early 1870s the club had a somewhat ambitious scheme to build a pavilion, fence and level the ground, and also build a bowling green. They applied to the Government for 150 Pounds towards the cost, but they got no more than a letter of acknowledgement.\nDuring 1875 and 1876, the Trustees spent the sum of 7 Pounds 3 Shillings and 9 Pence on fencing and other improvements to the ground, but there is nothing to suggest that anything in the line of a permanent pavilion had been erected.\nThe finding of good Gold in the Mines could sometimes cause the club to renege on their obligations. On one occasion in the 1890s, a party of gentlemen from the Croydon Club came riding into town and claimed that they had arranged a match against the Warrandyte Club and there was no one to play them. They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised to them in the local press, but they never came back until 1910.\nDuring the 1880s and 1890s, regular games were played against Kangaroo Ground, Ringwood,\n Yarra Flats, Eltham, Lilydale, with visits from the West End Brewery from Melbourne.\nMany players mentioned in newspaper reports played a major part of forming the community in Warrandyte, and have has streets named after them like John Till, Edward Kruse, R.Mahoney, Henry Stiggants &amp; John Speers, to name a few.\nThe Cameron Cricket Association (1905 – 1907).\nAt a public sports meeting on Saturday 14 October 1905 a club committee was formed, consisting of E.H.Cameron as president, Edwards Kruse as Secretary, and George Quick as treasurer. It was also put forward that the club join the Cameron Trophy Association, which comprised local clubs Christmas Hills, Kangaroo Ground, Caledonia &amp; Panton Hill.\nA month later on Saturday 18 November heralded the day the club played its first competitive cricket match, as they took on Christmas Hills at the Warrandyte Reserve. C.Sanford topped scored with 16, leading the team to a total of just 31, then captain John Till destroyed the opposition for just 21 runs, taking 6 for 5 in the process. Warrandyte fared better in their 2nd innings making 66, but Christmas Hills turned the tables the following week, and passed the target of 80 for the loss of 6 wickets.\nWarrandyte would claim their first win the following game at Kangaroo Ground, with John Till again the star, top scoring with 45 and taking 9 wickets, including 5 in the opposition total of just 9 in the 2nd innings.\nTill would show a liking to Kangaroo Ground's bowling in their return clash in round 7 at Warrandyte Reserve, scoring the club's first ever century, and the team finished their first season with 4 wins and 4 losses, narrowly losing the semi-final.\nWarrandyte would go through the following season undefeated, winning most of their games by an innings. But without finals, the premiership decider would revert to the completion of an abandoned game in round 1 against new team Yarra Glen. The game resumed after the season was finished to decide the premiers, and with Warrandyte 7/65 in their second innings, with a lead of just 55 runs, it appeared all the domination would amount to nothing. Resuming the game on 23 March 1907, Warrandyte's tail added another 19 runs, but this would prove crucial, as Yarra Glen were dismissed for just 67 in their 2nd innings, giving Warrandyte its first ever premiership by 8 runs.\nEarliest reference to women's cricket was noted on the ANA holiday back on 24 January 1906, when after the men played the visiting Carlton team, a ladies game was held. The locals victorious 29 runs to 19.\nThe Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association (1908 – 1932).\nWarrandyte were forced to not play in season 1907/08 after the Cameron Cricket Association disbanding due to lack of participating teams, so the club approached the Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association in September 1908. They were initially refused entry because of the opposition clubs reluctance to travel to Warrandyte, due to its remoteness at the time, however they were accepted on 2 October on the proviso they play all their games at opposition grounds. Only Blackburn made the long trek out to Warrandyte.\nThe step up in the standard of cricket was evident, even in the B Grade, with the club struggling against strong seasoned teams like Blackburn, Box Hill, Croydon, Doncaster, East Burwood, Ringwood &amp; Templestowe. Most of whom have been playing since the competition started in 1890. One highlight was Thomas Schubert taking 9/17 against Templestowe in 1909, a club record that would stand until 1996, and still the best bowling figures ever at Warrandyte Reserve. The team would struggle up until World War I, but that period saw the debuts of 100 game players Les Till (John's son), Jack &amp; William Colman, Les, Richard &amp; Bill McCulloch and William Moore.\nThe post war era coincided with a coming of age, as the club dominated B Grade. Season 1920/21 saw them win the premiership against Blackburn 2nd XI, and the first game of one of the club's greatest players, James Schubert, who still remains the only player to score 4,000 runs and take 400 wickets.\nWilliam Colman scored 468 runs and took 90 wickets in 1922/23, which is still a record for most wickets &amp; points in a single season.\nThey also spasmodically fielded a 2nd XI of their own for the first time in 1925/26, while the 1st XI yo-yoed between A and B Grade.\nDespite the advent of the automobile in the 1920s, most locals couldn't afford one, and were forced to travel to and from grounds by either bicycle or on the back of Horrie Smith's orchard truck.\nFor reasons not entirely clear, the club had to field its 2nd XI in the Ringwood and District Cricket Association's C Grade in 1931/32, probably due again to the distance to Warrandyte issue for opposition clubs. The reserve team lost the final, coincidentally against newly formed South Warrandyte Cricket Club's 1st XI, which from formed by Jack Colman , who played 116 games in his 18 years at the Warrandyte Cricket Club.\nThis period saw the first games of life members John Smith in 1921/22, Jack McAuley the following season, and Horrie Smith Jnr in 1926/27.\nThe Ringwood and District Cricket Association (1932 – 1948).\nThe following season in 1932/33, the 1st XI also joined the RDCA, where the reserve team won its first flag in 1993/34. The club attended the association's AGM in October 1934, but were missing from the fixture a month later, and returned to the BHRDCA for one season. Then according to the Box Hill Reporter newspaper on 30 August 1935, once again they were refused entry at the AGM due to \"inaccessibility\", so it was back to the RDCA. 1936/37 saw the 1sts claim its first RDCA premiership, on the back of fearful fast bowler Fred Carlton's 90 wickets and 2 competition bowling awards in 2 seasons.\n1 October 1938 was a red letter day in the club's history, when a 15-year-old Allan Chapman played his first game. Although being run out for just 1 at Wonga Park wasn't memorable, his legacy at the club would become indelible. He is roundly touted by those in the know as the club's greatest ever player, winning an unprecedented 7 first eleven Club Championships, and playing 1st XI cricket until the age of 48. The Chapman name would become synonymous with Warrandyte cricket, with 14 in total playing for the club, including 5 Life Members and grandson Matthew, who still plays today. Two games later another legend debuted, with Les Adams beginning his 35-year association with the club.\nFollowing two of the brightest moments was possibly its darkest, when on 13 January 1939, the Black Friday bush fires ravaged the town, destroying the clubrooms and all its equipment and memorabilia in its wake. Tragically former player Fred Topping perished defending his home. With help from The Victorian Cricket Association donating equipment, the club rebuilt and remarkably went on to win both the B and C Grade premierships in 1939/40. The 1st XI beat North Bayswater 205 &amp; 153 to 129 &amp; 166, while the 2nd XI easily defeated Ringwood 116 &amp; 1/38 to 58 &amp; 94.\nThe club had a -year hiatus during the WW2 period, and returned to once again dominate the competition in B Grade, going undefeated until their shock loss to East Ringwood in the semi-final. The promotion to A Grade saw them struggle again, and a return to B Grade in 1947/48 saw the 1st XI claim its 3rd flag in 12 seasons. The winning team consisted of Allan, Arthur, Adrian &amp; Colin Chapman, Stan Houghton, Jim Lee, Jack McAuley, Clive &amp; George Smith, Horace Smith Junior and Senior, and is one of the greatest to ever take the field for Warrandyte.\nTurbulent times (1949 – 1960).\nDespite being reigning premiers, the club took the extraordinary decision not to play at all the following season due to a disagreement on the captaincy. And when they reformed 1949/50, it was once again in the Box Hill league under the new name of West Warrandyte, which they kept for 5 seasons.\nNew Years Day in 1956 was a momentous day for the club, as 2,000 spectators filled the Warrandyte Reserve to watch a game against the Victoria Cricket Association at the Warrandyte Reserve to celebrate the club's centenary. After a few postponements due to weather, many local dignitaries attended, and the V.C.A. team consisted of four former Australian test cricketers. On the following Saturday, Centenary Ball was held in the Warrandyte Mechanic Institute and it proved another fine success. The members went to considerable trouble to decorate the hall in the club colours, green and gold and at the rear of the hall was the club birthday Cake with 100 blazing candles. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of the first Life Membership medallion to Jack Moore by Councillor William F. Betton, who paid a tribute to his fine services to the people of Warrandyte both on and off the sporting field.\n&lt;br&gt;\"Back row (L-R)\" Bill Betton (president), Graham Pike, Bill Taberner, Graham West, Ken Sargeant, Robert Stewart, Les Adams (manager)&lt;br&gt;\n\"Front row (L-R)\" Henrique Harding, Peter Adams, Glen Martin (C), Boyd Ewing, Laurie Warr\nThe celebrations continued the following season, when the 1st XI claimed the B Grade premiership in 1956/57 under the captaincy of Colin Chapman. The 'Dytes winning a tough contest against St Peters, 146 &amp; 201 versus 130 &amp; 201. That season also featured the introduction of the club's first ever junior side, an under 16s team.\nFor the first time since the club dispute, the Warrandyte failed to produce a 2nd XI the following season, which created differing opinions on team selection. This disharmony saw Morrie Bennett, who had played a handful of games, create the North Warrandyte Cricket Club which played in the RDCA. Its future was promising, but was forced to finally abandon after just 3 seasons, due largely to the fact that the Eltham Council was unable to build the club a ground due to the hilly terrain of the area.\nWarrandyte was in a dire financial situation, mainly due to the centenary commitments, so major changes were needed. Under the vision of new president of William Betton, a yearly Tradesman's Directory was introduced, which after a few years became a great money spinner for the club, and is still in operation today. They also established an under 16s team in 1958/59, and by 1960/61 changed its name to Warrandyte Footballers, and its colours from green and gold to red and white.\nStruggling years (1961 – 1977).\nWith most players returning from the failed North Warrandyte venture for the 1961/62 season, the club also began to see the fruits of its junior team when it fielded a 3rd eleven for the first time in 1963/64. One junior, Mark Davis, who would go on to be president and a Life Member, amassed a stunning 142 in the under 14s competition in 1965. But despite the growing numbers, the depth of quality in the 1st XI was lacking, and they failed to make the finals in every season in the 1960s.\nRegardless of the lack of team success, there were many momentous occasions &amp; personal highlights. After a career span of 35 years, Allan Chapman played his 163rd and final game in the 2nd XI's semi final loss in 1973. An even greater time span was Jack McAuley's who played his last game on 13 January 1968, nearly 46 years to the day after his debut on 21 January 1922. That was a record that stood until Allan Chapman's son, John, graduated from the juniors in 1963, and brought up 50 years at the club playing veterans in 2011/12. His father-in-law, Les Adams, ended a 35-year stint, playing his last game in 1974, while his son, Peter, won an amazing 6 consecutive 1st XI bowling awards in the 1960s. And Robert White, a talented all round sportsman, joined the club in 1970, and would go on to be the leading run scorer in the 1st XI, as well as holding two stints as president.\n\"Back row (L-R)\" Sandra Burton, Debbie Lamb, Maria McGhee, Marg World, Robyn Dalli, Teresa Prince&lt;br&gt;\n\"Front row (L-R)\" Sandra Jeffs, Jenny Chapman, Suzanne Chapman (captain), Jenni McLaws, Judith Davis\nSeason 1975/76 saw some big changes. The club rejoined the RDCA and the Women's XI, not seen since the start of the 20th century, was re-established. Their success was instant, winning the Victorian Women's Cricket Association premiership in its first attempt, thus ending the club's longest ever premiership drought. Instrumental in its creation and success were sisters Susanne &amp; Jenny Chapman, and the team would go on to play until 1992/93.\nThe golden era (1977 – 1985).\nSteve Pascoe, a talented all-rounder, was recruited from the Norwood Cricket Club as the first ever captain/coach in the winter of 1977, and his professionalism and fore thinking was just what the club needed. When he arrived, the club had 3 junior and 3 senior teams, and in the space of just 6 seasons, playing numbers had doubled for both.\nThe quality of playing stocks also improved, with the likes of Bob McDonald, Richard Bowen, Fred Jungwirth and Marty McCarthy recruited or developed from the junior ranks. Two in particular had lasting effects. Stan Davis was a brilliant on-field tactician and crafty leg spin bowler, and Bruce Kline a freakishly talented wicketkeeper, who while keeping up to the stumps to most bowlers, took a bewildering 31 stumpings and just 6 catches in one season. 13yo Brett Kline was part of the under 14s premiers in 1977/78, who would go on to become the senior games record holder in 2011, while Gerald Walshe played his first senior game in October 1978. 30 seasons later Walshe would claim a record 644 senior wickets.\nThe foundation was laid for the 1979/80 season, one that goes down in the history books as the club's greatest. Stan Davis took over the reins of the first eleven, and immediately led them to a long-awaited premiership. Bowling first, Jungwirth's 4/39 help dismiss Ainslie Park for just 124, which was passed for the loss of just 3 wickets, with John Chapman making 66. But a middle order collapse saw them lose 7/49, and with the final spread over 3 days, the game was far from won. But Max Summers and Stan Davis shared a last wicket stand of 83 to take the game away from the opposition, and they went on to win by 10 wickets. The club achieved its only senior trifecta, with the 2nd and 3rd elevens also victorious. And capping off a stunning season, were victories to both under 12s sides that included future stars in Michael and Cameron Day, Colin Dorning, Tony Sturesteps, Darren Peters, Brendan Baker and Greg Creber.\nTraditionally Warrandyte's 1st XI had always struggled when promoted to the highest grade, but much confidence was gained when they finished a credible 5th out of 14 teams in its first attempt in Chandler Shield, which at the time was one of the most revered and competitive in metropolitan Melbourne. But it was a C Grade clash that received the most attention, when the 3rd XI were decimated for 53 and 42 by an Eastfield 1st XI bowler that claimed 6/15 and 9/10. His name was Graeme Lloyd.\nLloyd was coming off two C Grade bowling awards in a row, and joined Warrandyte for the 1981/82 season, and went on to completely dominate the opposition. He claimed 66 wickets and won the Bill Dean Medal as the league's best player, the only time a Warrandyte player has won such an award at the highest level. He was instrumental in guiding the 1st XI to 3rd place on the ladder and finals, another first for the club. His batting however was quite the opposite. After a caught behind shout from a fast bowler, he removed his gloves and walked off. As the bemused umpire yelled out that he wasn't out, Graeme, who was halfway off the ground shouted over his shoulder, \"Close enough for me\". Captain Davis also had a stellar season, claiming 44 wickets himself and snatching the competition bowling award from Lloyd, whilst Robert White returned the club from a stint at District cricket, and averaged 80 with the bat.\n\"Back row (L-R)\" John McCartin, Brett Kline, John Chapman, Bruce Kline, Richard Bowen, Fred Jungwirth, Stephen Peake, Mark Davis, Graeme Lloyd&lt;br&gt;\n\"Front row (L-R)\" Robert White, Ann Pascoe (scorer), Steve Pascoe, Geoff Day (President), Stan Davis (C), Dianne Gathercole (Secretary), Marty McCarthy.\nWarrandyte beat Croydon United in the semi-final, a team that had humbled them in the final round, and faced the top side Wantirna South in the Chandler Shield final. It was uncharted territories for both clubs, and it was Warrandyte that batted first and nervously crawled to 9/120. Steve Pascoe made 42 of them, before a pivotal last wicket stand of 70 between John McCartin and Stan Davis that would go down in folklore. Davis then claimed 5/33 to rout the opposition for 128, and give the club a 62 run first innings lead midway through the 3rd and final day. Warrandyte looked to then bat out the day and claim a comfortable win, but after collapsing to be all out for 96, Wantirna South had 25 overs to score 159 runs in fading light. Fielding was almost impossible as dark clouds closed in on the ground and infielders were forced to scream out the direction of the ball to outfielders unable to pick up its flight. Davis refused to appeal against the light, preferring to play the game out to a finish, and when the opposition finished on 8/131, Warrandyte prevailed by 28 runs, claiming their first ever top grade premiership.\n\"Back row (L-R)\" Darren Peters, Colin Dorning (12th man), Wayne Amiguet, Graeme Jacobs, Fred Jungwirth, Bruce Kline, Graeme Lloyd&lt;br&gt;\n\"Front row (L-R)\" John Chapman, Steve Pascoe, John Salter, Robert White, Ann Pascoe (scorer), Marty McCarthy\nAfter failing to reach the finals in their title defense, John Salter was recruited from district cricket as captain/coach in 1983/84. In one of the great batting line ups of all time, he scored a record 690 runs, while Graeme Jacobs, Robert White and Wayne Amiguet all scored 400 plus runs.\nGraeme Lloyd was a one-man wrecking machine, taking a further 71 wickets, the most ever since 1922/23. Finishing on top the ladder at the end of the season, they cruised to the final where they defeated East Ringwood and claimed their second premiership in the top grade. Robert White had an excellent all-round game, scoring 84 out of the 304 team score, then took 5/60 with the ball, as East Ringwood fell 60 runs short.\nThe next season they finished 2nd on the back of Salter's record breaking 955 run season, and set up a second successive grand final when they amassed 5/316 in the semi-final. But East Ringwood caused a huge upset and passed the score 8 wickets down.\nThe loss brought the season to a premature close, and as it turned out, also ended the most successful era in the club's history. In just six seasons, 13 premierships were won. 7 senior, including 3 for the first eleven, and 6 in the juniors.\nRebuilding phase (1986 – 1994).\nIn 1985/86 the club lost their equivalent of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh, with Salter, Lloyd and Kline all departing the club. Despite record playing numbers, peaking with 15 teams in 1986/87, and the introduction of the veterans XI in 1988/89, the next few seasons saw the 1st XI languish in the bottom half of the ladder, but remained in Chandler Shield. Following a year where the highest ranked senior side was the 8th placed reserve side, John Sharman was recruited to the club as captain/coach in 1990/91. His work ethic on the training field rubbed off on the field, as the top 3 teams all made finals. Sharman also brought with him an array of talent, including determined opening batsman Andrew Hood, Campbell Horlock and all-rounder Harry Drysdale. And with the emergence of Warrandyte juniors Tony Sturesteps, Gerald Walshe and David Mooney, the 1st XI were becoming competitive again, returning to the finals in 1992/93. They lost the semi-final to Ainslie Park, which would start one of the great RDCA rivalries. The next season, local fruit shop owner and former Australian test cricket Rodney Hogg was talked into rolling the arm over again. Despite being 42 years old at the time, was still extremely quick when in the mood, and terrorised many a batsman in his 2 seasons at Warrandyte.\nAfter thrashing Wonga Park in the semi, they met Ainslie Park in the 1993/94 Chandler Shield Grand Final, which would twist and turn into the greatest RDCA final of all time. Scheduled for 3 days and 240 overs, Warrandyte batted first, as John Sharman's 64 runs pushed the score to a meagre total of 175 from 90 overs. With a day and a half day remaining, there was plenty of time, and when Ainslie Park got within 35 runs with 7 wickets in hand, they had one hand their first Chandler Shield. Then Hogg produced a tremendous spell of bowling, and sparked a collapse of 6/31 to end day 2 with the game well and truly in the balance. The final day began with Warrandyte needing 1 wicket, and Ainslie 5 runs for victory. The first over was a maiden bowled by Sturesteps, then Hogg sent a yorker into the stumps, and Warrandyte into delirium.\nHogg ended up with 7/33, all that was required was to bat out the remainder of the day to claim victory. But as only Warrandyte can, a shaky batting display opened the door, and the team were precariously at 7/77. A solid partnership recovered the damage to get to 7/113 with just 22 overs left in the match, but again the game changed, as the final 3 wickets fell in 3 overs. So Ainslie required 117 runs from 19 overs to reverse the result, and raced to 0/24 after the first 2. Then another twist, 2 quick wickets to Hogg and then a run out made it 3/34. The score reached 3/49 with 11 overs to play, when Hogg struck a batsman on the head with a bouncer, and an ambulance was required on the ground. Light was fading during the delay, and the umpires decided play couldn't recommence, so once again Warrandyte assumed the victory. But then more controversy, as RDCA officials announced play would continue on an unprecedented 4th day. So the players returned to the East Ringwood oval, and with a huge crowd in attendance, fortunes ebbed and flowed again until 7 runs were required from the final over with 5 wickets in hand. A bye from a disputed run out, a boundary, and finally a leg bye saw Ainslie Park reach the total, winning outright with 3 balls remaining of the 240th and last over. Warrandyte left to ponder how the lost a game they had already won\nHogg took another 35 wickets the following season, but the firsts struggled for runs after the departures of Sharman and his recruits. They failed to reach the finals, and spent the rest of the decade regularly staving off relegation. Three highlights stand out in the 90s. Two 1st XI records were broken when Chris Snaidero took all 10 wickets in an innings in February 1996, and David Mooney scored 184 not out in January 1997. While the 4th XI were the only Warrandyte team to win 3 premierships in a row.\nSeason 1996/97 was a tough one both on and off the field. Most teams languished around the bottom of the ladder, and the 5th XI couldn't field a side after Christmas. Diminishing player numbers also had a critical effect on finances, and the club were forced to float the idea of merging with South Warrandyte to survive. However this option was voted against, and both clubs continued and prospered in the coming seasons.\nOne positive to come out of this period was the council refurbishing the practice net area after the 1997/98 season.\nThe start of the 21st century presented an opportunity to showcase the history with the announcement of the team of the century. The nomination criterion was a minimum of 50 games, 1,000 runs or 100 wickets, and was voted on by all living life members. The team known as Club 12 was Allan Chapman (C), John Sharman (V/C), John Chapman, Graeme Jacobs, Fred Jungwirth, Bruce Kline (w/k), Graeme Lloyd, Steve Pascoe, Greg Tregear, Gerald Walshe, Robert White, Alan Woolcock. All team members aside from Allan Chapman, who died in 1981, were honoured at a function on 25 November 2000.\nThe 3 seasons from 1998/99 to 2000/01 were also particularly taxing, with none of the 4 senior grades reaching higher than 9th on the ladder. This caused a tremendous strain on morale, causing many players to lose interest, and the 4th XI were often playing short and sometimes forfeiting altogether. An RDCA condition at the time was for a club to remain in the top grade of Chandler Shield, it must field a minimum of 4 sides. As Warrandyte couldn't guarantee that, it was decided in a heated committee meeting to relegate itself.\n&lt;br&gt;As it turned out before the season started, the RDCA removed that rule, meaning Warrandyte could have remained.\nLooking back and moving forward (2001 – present).\n16 August 2001 saw the launch of the Warrandyte Cricket Club website. Created by Steve Goddard, it showcased the rich statistical history of the club, and is still one of the most extensive local sporting websites in the country.\nThe club entered the 2nd tier Wilkins Cup in 2001/02, and found the format of the mixed one and two day structure unpredictable. The 1st XI would often find themselves playing finals one year, and fighting relegation the next. Some excellent work was being done with the juniors, thanks largely to the introduction of a father/son 4th XI run mainly by Lee Dehmel and Graham Rees.\nSeason 2002/03 saw the introduction of the Steve Pascoe Medal, which became an annual award given to the highest vote polling player at the club, selected by the players on a 3-2-1 basis each game. The first season was low key, with only an overall medal presented to Brendan Baker. A vote count and separate grade medals were introduced the following year, which are named after former greats of that grade: Gerald Walshe, Brett Kline, Nathan Croft, Jim Gathercole and Bob Leguier (1st XI to 5th XI). The votes count, which is now combined with the club's Presentation Night, has developed from humble beginnings into the biggest event on the calendar.\nSeason 2003/04 saw 5-time 1st XI Club Champion Adam White, son of Life Member Robert, win his first of two association best and fairest medals. White has become one of the club's most decorated players ever, with a multitude of 1st XI awards including 7 batting, 1 bowling and 2 Gerald Walshe Medals, as well as 2 Steve Pascoe Medals.\nThe club celebrated its 150th birthday with a dinner held on 22 January 2005 at it was an outstanding success. Then on Sunday 13 February 2005, the club continued the celebrations with a Twenty20 against an Invitational XI that included a mix of District cricketers, AFL footballers identities including Sam Mitchell and Gerard Whateley, along with entertainers Wilbur Wilde and Ernie Dingo as MC.\nUp until 2007, statistics were collated from club scorebooks dated back to 1952. But after extensive research conducted by Steve Goddard at the State Library of Victoria, match scores and articles were obtained from various newspapers dating back to when the club starting competitively in 1905 and beyond. Previously all 1st XI players were given a number in order of their debut, and with over 800 extra match results discovered, 164 more players were added to the list. John Till is credited as Warrandyte 1st XI player No.1, while the most recent is Luke Warren No.431.\nA Heritage Night club function was held on 20 January 2007, where past and present players were honoured with their new number. It was also the 25th anniversary of the club's first premiership in the top grade, and the players reunited. The function followed a Past Players Day, when the newly created Steve Pascoe Cup was fought out between rivals Warrandyte and Norwood, where Pascoe is a life member at both clubs. Pascoe also umpired the game, and awarded the Chris Snaidero Medal to the man of the match. Snaidero is another legend of both cricket clubs. Norwood were victors on this occasion, and the cup will be up for grabs whenever the teams play.\nOverall the decade was extremely successful, and the winning culture improved player numbers that was previously eroded. From 2003/04 to 2010/11, 30 out of a possible 38 senior teams participated in finals, claiming 7 premierships, as well as 3 junior and 1 veterans flags. But unfortunately, none for the 1st XI in 3 attempts, who are still working and striving towards the ultimate success, and a return to the top grade.\nClub Legends.\n&lt;br&gt;\nWilliam Colman, James Schubert, Richard McCulloch, Les Till, Les McCulloch, William Moore, John Moore, Jack McAuley, Allan Chapman, Les Adams, Horace Smith Jnr, Peter Adams, Lindsay Bellinger, Alan Woolcock, John Chapman, Alan Bellinger, Geoff Day, Robert White, Stephen Peake, Graeme Lloyd, Steve Pascoe, Fred Jungwirth, Robert Leguier, Graham Lawrence, Mark Davis, Chris Snaidero, Geoff Taylor, Darren Peters, Gerald Walshe, Brett Kline, Tony Sturesteps, Max Summers, Greg Tregear, Russell Dorning, Brendan Baker, Cameron Day, Steve Bell, David Mooney, Greg Creber, Colin Dorning, Stephen Warr, Nathan Croft, Stephen Goddard, Tyson Brent, Campbell Holland, Dean Gidley, Adam White, Adam Beardall, Matthew Chapman, Matthew Sazenis, John Prangley, Craig Lincoln, Daniel Wellesley.\nNotable players.\nAustralian Test players – Rodney Hogg&lt;br&gt;\nDistrict 1st XI players – Bruce Kline, David Stickels, Robert White, Lindsay Clay, John Salter, Greg Tregear, Andrew Hood, Reece Kline, Jason Kline, Brett Montgomery, Warren Cottrell, Christopher Bambury, Thomas Naughtin, Ayrton Dehmel, Jake Sherriff\n&lt;br&gt;Others – Jon Hassall, Brett Ratten, David Cloke, Jason Cloke, Cameron Cloke, Travis Cloke, Angus Monfries (AFL footballers), Clinton Grybas (commentator), Adam Beardall (world's smallest and least important man), Doug Hilton"

        "text": "The Idaho Vandals baseball team was the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of the University of Idaho, located in Moscow, Idaho.\nVarsity baseball was played at Idaho through the 1980 season, primarily in the northern division of the Pacific Coast Conference. During the first six years of the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals won four titles under two head coaches, Wayne Anderson (1964, 1966) and John G. Smith (1967, 1969).\nThe 1966 and 1969 teams advanced to within one round of the College World Series, falling in the District 7 finals, today's \"Super-Regionals\" (Sweet 16).\n1960s.\n1964.\nIn the first year of the Big Sky Conference, Idaho went undefeated in conference play, and swept the title series with Weber State, played in Missoula, Montana. For a final season, the Vandals also played in the five-team Northern Division (of the defunct PCC), but were 5–11 in league games and finished last. During the final weekend of the season, Idaho upset Palouse neighbor Washington State in Pullman to eliminate the Cougars from title contention as Oregon took a two-game lead to clinch; WSU won the next day in Moscow.\nIdaho was 8–2 in non-conference games for an overall record of . As a first-year league in 1964, the Big Sky champion was not invited to the NCAA playoffs. That summer, Oregon and Oregon State joined the AAWU (Pac-8) and Idaho's league play forward was in the Big Sky only.\n1966.\nLed by senior pitcher Bill Stoneman with a 0.45 ERA, Idaho advanced to the NCAA postseason for the first time with a 31–7 regular season record. They traveled to Greeley and eliminated Colorado State College (now Northern Colorado) and Air Force, but then fell at Tucson to Arizona. The overall record remains the best in school history, and the team was inducted into the Vandal Hall of Fame in 2012.\nIn addition to Stoneman, the Vandal pitching staff included future major leaguer Frank Reberger of Caldwell; both signed with the Chicago Cubs' organization after the season. As a major leaguer, Stoneman threw two no-hitters for the Montreal Expos, in 1969 and 1972.\nIt was Wayne Anderson's ninth and final season as head coach, and he was baseball coach of the year in the Big Sky. He was promoted to head coach of the basketball team in September and stepped away from baseball.\n1967.\nAfter two seasons as defensive line coach for the football team, John G. Smith became the head coach for baseball in November 1966. With a new home field, the 1967 team repeated as Big Sky champions at 7–1, \nand a record for the regular season, hampered by weather. Idaho lost in the first round of the NCAA playoffs at Colorado Springs to Air Force. Smith was the conference coach of the year.\n1969.\nThe 1969 team finished the regular season at and in the Idaho swept two from Air Force at home in Moscow to advance, then lost on the road in the District 7 finals at Mesa to host the eventual CWS champion.\n1970s.\nThe Big Sky expanded to eight teams in the summer of 1970, all with baseball, and split into two divisions for the 1971 season with a three-game playoff to determine the The two Montana schools soon dropped the sport and Boise State was moved to the Northern Division with Idaho and Gonzaga for 1973. In May 1974, the Big Sky announced its discontinued sponsorship of baseball (and four other sports). Southern division champion Idaho State dropped their team weeks later, and three-time conference champion Weber State followed. The three Northern division schools (Idaho, Boise State, Gonzaga) joined the new Northern Pacific Conference (NorPac) for the 1975 season. (The NorPac included the larger baseball programs in the Northwest outside of the Pac-8, including Portland State, Portland, Seattle U., Puget Sound, and later, Eastern Washington.)\nKen Schrom of Grangeville was selected in the tenth round of the 1973 MLB Draft as a high school senior, but opted for college. Also a quarterback for the football team, he pitched for the Vandals for three seasons until selected in the 1976 draft following his junior year. (An injury to his non-throwing (left) shoulder during the previous football season influenced his decision to leave school early.)\n1980.\nAfter six seasons in the NorPac, both Idaho and Boise State discontinued baseball as a varsity sport , following the 1980 season, citing budget (BSU's program returned four decades later, in 2020, before being cut in the same year during the COVID-19 pandemic.)\nAn assistant coach in football and basketball for the Vandals, Smith was the head baseball coach for the final fourteen seasons (1967–1980), then continued in the UI athletic department as equipment manager for the next seven When John L. Smith (b.1948) arrived on campus as an assistant football coach in 1982, both began using their middle initial to avoid confusion.\nThe last varsity game with neighbor Washington State was a home win on April 30, 1980, which was the first over the Cougars in thirteen years, breaking a losing streak of over forty games (with two ties) dating back to 1967. The final games for the program were less than two weeks later, two doubleheaders against Puget Sound: the Vandals swept on Friday, and were washed out on Saturday.\nClub sport.\nBaseball resurfaced on campus as a club sport in 1984.\nVenues.\nMacLean Field.\nIdaho's ballpark from the early 1920s through 1966 was MacLean Field, just west of the Administration Building. Its infield was originally located in the southwest corner of the multi-sport venue, with Memorial Gymnasium as a backdrop in left field and the running track's west stretch in center and right field. After Neale Stadium opened for football in autumn 1937, home plate was moved to the opposite northeast corner of MacLean () for the 1940 season, with the former football grandstand on the east berm along the third base line. The southern portion of the permanent football seating, adjacent to left field, was excess capacity for baseball and was removed during World War II.\nThe new southwestern alignment (home plate to center field) had abundant foul territory, especially along the third base line; track and field continued at MacLean until after the war, and this area was occupied by various field events. Other than a backstop, there was little foul territory fencing, except to protect a parking lot to the right; it also went without dugouts, as the teams sat on open benches. Later seasons employed a low temporary outfield fence, and new tennis courts in right field with perimeter chain-link fencing provided a higher permanent barrier; until 1955, the tennis courts were at the site of the library. \nThe distance down the left field line in 1959 was and the approximate elevation of the diamond was above sea level.\nThe old southwest infield became the site of the multi-purpose field house (1949–75) in deep right center It was razed after the enclosure of the Kibbie Dome in 1975 and was soon occupied by additional outdoor tennis courts; the trees that were along its east wall continue to stand. The swim center and P.E. building (women's gym), opened in 1970, are in the MacLean outfield, from right to center field. Left field continues today as open grass; its backdrop was the Shattuck Arboretum to the south and the berm between them provided elevated grass \nGuy Wicks Field.\nAfter the 1966 season, construction of the new College of Education building began behind home plate, and a new baseball field was built at the northwest area of campus, just south of Paradise Creek (and Pullman Road) (). Aligned southeast with above-ground dugouts and a modest concrete grandstand, it opened as \"University Field\" in April and was named for late alumnus Guy Wicks, a two-sport head coach and university administrator, during the 1969 postseason. It was also without permanent fencing, and used a low temporary one in the outfield; the backdrop in left center was the six-story Wallace dormitory; the field elevation was approximately less than MacLean Field."

        "text": "The women's road race of the 2004 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on 1 October in Verona, Italy. The race was 73.75 km long, which constituted of 5 laps of a circuit around Torricelle, including the 3.4 km Torricelle climb, with an average gradient of approximately 4% and 7% at the steepest point. 66 junior women's participated in the race. The course was almost identical to the one used for the 1999 UCI Road World Championships.\nThe race was won by the Dutch rider Marianne Vos. After a rather controlled race until the final climb, Vos attacked at the right spot and soloed the remaining 10 km to the finish. The silver medal went to Marta Bastianelli (Italy), winning the chase group sprint half a minute behind. Third on the podium was another Dutch rider, Ellen van Dijk.\nCourse.\nThe race consisted of 5 laps of 14.75 kilometres on a circuit around Torricelle and was similar to course at the 2009 UCI Road World Championships. The start/finish was at the Piazza Brà. The race started in a northerly direction for three kilometres of flat surface before the start of the 3.1 kilometre-long Torricelle climb that begins from the Viale dei Colli. The climb has an average gradient of about 4%. The final part of the Torricelle is the hardest with a gradient of 7%, where the Viale dei Colli turns to the Via Santa Giuliana 700 metres from the top marking the highest point of the race at 6.1 km. Then the riders swoop down the twisty street for just over 4.5 km before two 90-degree right-handers in close succession, the first coming at 10.7 km at the intersection of Vie Caroto and Cipolla. The feed station is at 12.3 km, before riders cross the Ponte Aleardi bridge and execute a large 'U' that brings them back along the finishing straight of the Corso Porta Nuova.\nRace.\nThe race started at 9:30 on a rather cloudy morning.\nMarianne Vos signaled her presence right after the start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after a bit more than 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, at the foot of the Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy."

He made centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 14 and 21 occasions in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches respectively. With over 14,000 runs, Gibbs is fourth in the list of South Africa's most prolific run-scorers in international cricket. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" included him among its \"top 40 cricketers of 2004\".\nGibbs made his Test and ODI debuts in 1996 against India and Kenya respectively. However, it was only in 1999 that he made his first century, when he scored 125 against the West Indies, an ODI South Africa won at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth. He followed that with another century against Australia in the 1999 World Cup, although this time in a losing cause. In 2002, Gibbs made three centuries in consecutive innings, equaling a record that was previously held by two other players. He was denied a fourth successive century when he remained 97 not out against Bangladesh. His career-best score of 175, achieved against Australia, led South Africa to the most successful run-chase in the history of ODIs. Gibbs made a minimum of one century each year from 1999 to 2009. As of October 2015, he is jointly second with Hashim Amla (both with 21 centuries) in the number of ODI centuries among his countrymen, only behind AB de Villiers (22). Along with Shikhar Dhawan, Sourav Ganguly, and Chris Gayle, Gibbs holds the record for the most centuries in the ICC Champions Trophy, with three.\nGibbs' first Test century, 211 not out, was made against New Zealand at the AMI Stadium, Christchurch, in March 1999. His highest score of 228 came against Pakistan at the Newlands Cricket Ground, Cape Town in 2003. These two are the only instances of his scoring above 200. In Tests, Gibbs scored centuries against all Test-playing teams except Sri Lanka. In ODIs, Gibbs scored centuries against 10 different teams, including all nine Test-playing teams. On 6 February 2005, he became only the second batsman, after Australia's Ricky Ponting, to score an ODI century against all Test playing nations, when he scored 100 against England. Gibbs also played 23 Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) for South Africa between 2005 and 2010. He did not score any centuries in the format; his best score of 90 not out came against the West Indies."

He is a left-handed top-order batsman and plays as the wicket-keeper in One Day International (ODI) format of the game. Described by the English cricket writer Peter Roebuck as \"among the most polished and prudent of batsmen\", Sangakkara has made centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 38 and 25 occasions in Test and ODI matches respectively, as of 24 August 2015. He has at times been top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings for Test batsmen. His awards include ODI Cricketer of the Year, captain of the ICC World XI Test team, and the 2011 ICC People's Choice Award (all at the 2011 ICC Awards), and being named one of the \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 2012.\nSangakkara made his Test debut against South Africa in July 2000. He scored his maiden Test century in 2001, against India, and his first double-century during the 2002 Asian Test Championship final against Pakistan. Sangakkara's highest score in Test cricket is 319, which he scored against Bangladesh in 2014. During his innings of 287 against South Africa in 2006, he and Mahela Jayawardene set a new world record of 624 runs for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test or first-class cricket. In the following year, he scored back-to-back double-centuries against Bangladesh, the fifth instance of successive double-centuries in Test cricket. He has scored 200 or more runs in a Test match on eleven occasions, surpassing Brian Lara, who has scored 200 or more runs in a Test match on nine occasions; only Donald Bradman (12 double-centuries) has done so more often. He became the ninth batsman and second Sri Lankan to score centuries against all Test-playing nations in December 2007, when he scored 152 against England. He was appointed captain of the Sri Lanka team in March 2009, following the resignation of Mahela Jayawardene, and the first of his seven Test centuries as captain came against Pakistan in July of the same year. Sangakkara has the second-highest batting average—69.60 per innings—for a captain who scored a minimum of 1,500 runs.\nHe made his ODI debut in July 2000 against Pakistan, and his first century in this format was against the same team during the 2003 Cherry Blossom Sharjah Cup. The start of his ODI career was \"fairly ordinary\", according to one cricket journalist, as he only scored two centuries in four years. His highest score of 169 was made at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, against South Africa, during South African cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2013. Sangakkara's only ODI century as captain was scored against New Zealand in a group stage match in the 2011 ICC World Cup. In the sixth match of the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series, Sangakkara became the fastest Sri Lankan cricketer, and third in all, to reach 10,000 ODI runs. He played 56 Twenty20 International matches (T20Is) between 2006 and 2014; his highest score in the format is 78."

        "text": "The 1972 ILTF Women's Tennis Circuit was the 58th season since the founding of the International Lawn Tennis Association and was the final season to be solely administered by the ILTF.\nIt was composed of the 2nd annual Virginia Slims Circuit with 20 events, a tour of tennis tournaments for female tennis players, sponsored by Virginia Slims cigarettes, but approved by the ILTF and the 2nd annual ILTF Commercial Union Assurance Grand Prix circuit with 13 events which included Roland Garros and Wimbledon, and sponsored by Commercial Union insurance company and the 58th annual ILTF World Circuit with 125 events.\nThe following season would see the formation of the Women's Tennis Association in which the ILTF would eventually have to share responsibility for administering the worldwide tour for women something at this time it was resisting to change. In 1973 the majority of the ILTF events under direct administration of that organisation will form the ILTF Independent Tour.\nComposition.\nGrand Prix Circuit.\nThe 1972 Commercial Union Assurance Grand Prix was a tennis circuit administered by the International Lawn Tennis Federation which served as a forerunner to the current Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour. The circuit consisted of two of the four modern Grand Slam tournaments including Roland Garros, Wimbledon and open tournaments recognised by the ILTF. That circuit ran from 27 March to 4 September. Evonne Goolagong won most events on this circuit with 5 titles.\nVirginia Slims Circuit.\nPrior to the establishment of this circuit there was an inequality between the prize money purses for male and female tennis players which gave rise to complaints from a number of the leading female tennis players of the time. Nine of them, including Billie Jean King, became later known as the \"Original 9\" after being banned from the then existing multi-gender invitational professional events run by the influential United States Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) due to their boycotting of the Pacific Southwest Championships. This resulted in the first Virginia Slims-sponsored event being held in September 1970 in Houston, an event which laid the groundwork for the establishment of the annual Virginia Slims Circuit the following year. The 1972 Virginia Slims Circuit consisted on 22 tournaments including the U.S. Open the circuit began on 12 January and ended on 11 October and offered $587,775 in prize money. Billie Jean King won most events on this circuit with 7 titles of her 11 titles in total she played on all three circuits and won events across all three.\nILTF World Circuit.\nThe 1972 ILTF World Circuit consisted of 125 events including the Australian Open that were not part of the sponsored Virginia Slims and Grand Prix circuits. It began 29 December 1971 and ended on 25 December 1972 with Border Championships, East London, South Africa This years singles title leader Evonne Goolagong won 5 tournaments on this circuit her total 12 tournaments were across two circuits, this one and the Grand Prix.\nSchedule.\nThis is an incomplete calendar of all events that formed the majority of the ILTF Circuit and the Commercial Union Assurance Company and Virginia Slims sponsored tennis circuits in the year 1972, with player progression documented from the quarterfinals stage. The table also includes the Grand Slam tournaments, the 1972 Virginia Slims Championships and the 1972 Federation Cup.\nStatistical information.\nThese tables present the number of singles (S), doubles (D), and mixed doubles (X) titles won by each player and each nation during the 1972 Virginia Slims Circuit.

        "title": "1973 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 1973 Belmont Stakes was the 105th running of the Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, held on June 9, 1973. Facing a field of five horses, Secretariat won by 31 lengths, the largest margin of victory in Belmont history, in front of a crowd of 69,138 spectators. His winning time of 2 minutes and 24 seconds still stands as the American record for a mile and a half on dirt. The event was televised and broadcast over the radio.\nSecretariat was widely viewed as the favorite to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance and the possibility of running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause him to lose. Out of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and My Gallant overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.\nThe victory in the Belmont, when combined with Secretariat's previous victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, meant he completed the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. This was significant, as Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the feat and broke a 25-year drought where no horse had completed the achievement.\nPre-race coverage.\nSecretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant were the first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on favorite to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont when compared to the Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race went too fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.\nKnightly Dawn was entered into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the presence of Knightly Dawn, William Boniface of \"The Baltimore Sun\" believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success had been in the Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.\nThere was much speculation going into the Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Boniface felt Secretariat was in the best shape, almost as good as when he entered the Kentucky Derby weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.\nEvent details.\nPost time for the race was 5:38 PM EDT. It was televised by CBS and aired on CBS Radio. All jockeys competing were . The weather during the race was clear, and the course conditions were fast. The scratch of Knightly Dawn before the race reduced the purse to $150,200, which was awarded to the first through fourth-place finishers in the sums of $90,120, $33,044, $18,024, and $9,012, respectively.\nAttendance figures were speculated to be around 70,000 leading up to the race, which was accurate as the official attendance for the event was reported to be 69,138. This became the second-most attended Belmont Stakes at the time, after the 1971 race that had 82,694 in attendance.\nRace summary.\nOut of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham raced evenly through the first turn. Through a half-mile, the two were even. Entering the backstretch and approaching three-quarters of a mile, Secretariat began to distance himself as Sham began to fade, ultimately finishing last. It was later discovered that Sham had suffered a hairline fracture of his right front cannon bone during the race, which ended his racing career.\nSecretariat continued to extend his advantage for the rest of the race, finishing 31 lengths over the second-place finisher, Twice a Prince. Twice a Prince started slowly and moved along the rail until reaching second position, passing Sham and outpacing My Gallant. Track announcer Chic Anderson described Secretariat's move from the backstretch with the famous call, \"Secretariat is widening now. He is moving like a tremendous machine!\"\nSecretariat set the Belmont Stakes track record at 2:24 and the record for largest margin of victory. Secretariat also broke the American record for a mile-and-a-half on a dirt track, breaking the previous record of 2:, set by Going Abroad in 1964.\nAnalysis.\nNeil Milbert of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that Secretariat \"ran what may have been the greatest horse race in history.\" When asked about Secretariat's margin of victory, trainer Lucien Laurin stated: \"Naturally, not that big!\" He further commented on Sham's performance saying, \"The horse we had to kill, we did.\" My Gallant's jockey Ángel Cordero Jr. said Secretariat was \"just like a car.\" Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told the press that he saw the timer on the track hit 2:20 and he told himself \"Oh I can make it\" and continued to press Secretariat forward to break the course record. The UPI wrote that Secretariat's performance in the race put him in the ranks of the greatest race horses of all-time.\nThat day at Belmont Park, $7.9 million was wagered on the nine races that were held during the day, which includes $2.2 million from off-track betting. A total of $5.6 million was bet through the mutuels that day. The Stakes itself had $519,689 bet on it. Bettors holding 5,617 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs and also because the $2 was worth $2.20.\nAftermath.\nThrough his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and Kentucky Derby, Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were course records and still stand.\nFollowing the Belmont, Secretariat was allowed several weeks rest before entering a few more competitions and then starting his a career as a stud, where he had been syndicated for close to $6.08 million.\nIn part due to accomplishing the Triple Crown and winning other races during the 1973 calendar season, Secretariat won Horse of the Year for the second consecutive year. In addition, he also won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse. He was inducted to the Thoroughbred Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1974.\nIn 2013, the 40th anniversary of his Belmont win was commemorated by the New York Racing Association by placing a blue-and-white checkered pole (the colors of Meadow Stable) at the Belmont track, located from the finish line to mark the 31-length margin of victory."

        "title": "Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1990)",
        "text": "Billy Rayshun Hamilton (born September 9, 1990) is an American professional baseball center fielder who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, Chicago Cubs, Miami Marlins, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox. The Reds selected Hamilton in the second round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2013.\nKnown for his speed, Hamilton holds the Minor League Baseball single-season stolen base record with 155 steals—10 higher than the previous Minor League record set by Vince Coleman. He also holds the Cincinnati Reds record for most stolen bases by a rookie in a season, and stole 230 bases from 2014 to 2017, the most of any player in MLB over that time period. He ranked third in steals among all MLB players in the 2010s with 299 steals in the decade.\nEarly career.\nAmateur career.\nHamilton attended Taylorsville High School in Taylorsville, Mississippi, where he was all-state in baseball, football and basketball. He was a top football prospect at wide receiver, signing a letter of intent to play college football at Mississippi State University.\nProfessional career.\nCincinnati Reds.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Cincinnati Reds selected Hamilton in the second round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft.\nPrior to the 2011 season, Hamilton was ranked by \"Baseball America\" as the 50th-best prospect in baseball. That season, while playing for the Dayton Dragons, Hamilton became the 12th minor league player to have 100 stolen bases in a season, and the first since 2001. He finished the 2011 season with 104 total stolen bases and hit .278/.340/.360. Prior to 2012, \"Baseball America\" ranked Hamilton as the 48th-best prospect. MLB rated Hamilton as the 31st-best prospect, fourth-best shortstop, and the second-best prospect in the Reds organization behind catcher Devin Mesoraco.\nOn August 21, 2012, Hamilton stole a record 146th base in his 120th game of the season for the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. The record was previously held by Vince Coleman for the Class A Macon Redbirds, set in 1983. He finished the 2012 season with 155 stolen bases and hit .311/.410/.420.\nAfter the 2012 season, the Reds announced that Hamilton, who originally played shortstop, would move to center field for 2013. Bill Bavasi, the Reds' vice president of scouting and player development, told MLB.com that the move was made for several reasons, including the fact that two other established shortstops, Zack Cozart and Didi Gregorius, were already on the roster.\nPrior to the 2013 season, Hamilton was ranked as the Reds' best prospect by \"Baseball America\". For the season with the Louisville Bats, in 123 games he stole 75 bases and hit .256/.308/.343.\nMajor leagues.\nThe Reds promoted Hamilton to the major leagues on September 2, 2013, and made his debut on September 3 against the St. Louis Cardinals as a pinch runner for Ryan Ludwick. He stole second base off Yadier Molina, and came around to score on a Todd Frazier double. Hamilton appeared in four major league games as a pinch runner until September 10 when, in the seventh inning, he replaced Shin-Soo Choo in center field and also made his batting debut, going 0-for-2 in a loss at home to the Chicago Cubs.\nHamilton made his first start on September 18, 2013, in a Reds road win over the Houston Astros. Playing center field and batting ninth, in his first at-bat of the game he notched his first Major League hit, a second-inning double to left field off Astros' starter Brad Peacock, and later got his first run batted in, driving in Todd Frazier with an infield single. For the game (which went 13 innings), Hamilton reached base five times, going 3-for-4 with two walks, two runs scored, one RBI, and four stolen bases in four attempts off four pitchers. Hamilton became the first Major League player since 1920 to steal four bases in his first Major League start. In his first 10 times on base, he stole nine bases and scored six runs. He was successful in his first 13 steal attempts, before being thrown out on his 14th attempt.\nHamilton became a regular with the Cincinnati Reds in 2014. He had something of a rough start to the season, hitting just .221 through April 27 and being caught in five of his first 15 attempts at stealing. By around the time of the All-Star break, however, Hamilton's stats had greatly improved and he was attracting positive attention from a number of sources, tipped as a potential Gold Glove candidate for defense and also noted for unexpected power hitting. On September 2, Hamilton, with his 55th stolen base of the season, set a Cincinnati Reds franchise record for most stolen bases in a season by a rookie, edging out the mark of 54 set in 1909 by Bob Bescher. Despite this, Hamilton was second in Major League Baseball for stolen bases at the time, with Dee Gordon having recorded 58. For the season, he batted .250/.292/.355 with 56 stolen bases while leading the league in being caught stealing, with 23. On October 23, Hamilton was nominated for the 2014 Gold Glove for National League Center field, but lost to Juan Lagares of the New York Mets. Hamilton also finished second in NL Rookie of the Year voting, losing out to New York Mets pitcher Jacob DeGrom.\nAt the opening of the 2015 season, Hamilton joined Vince Coleman (1987) as the only players in Major League Baseball history to steal six bases in their team's first three games. In the following game, he stole a seventh base, again matching Coleman for a record by being one of two players to steal seven bases within the first four games of the season. He ended the season hitting .226/.274/.289 with 8 doubles and 3 triples (all career lows) and 57 stolen bases in 412 at-bats. Balls he hit had the lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (79.3 miles per hour), and he had the ninth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (29.7 feet per second).\nIn 2016, Hamilton hit a career-best .260 with a career-low three home runs and 17 RBIs in 119 games, going 58/66 in stolen bases. Balls he hit had the second-lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (80.0 miles per hour), and he had the sixth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (30.2 feet per second).\nOn May 4, 2017, Hamilton stole his 200th career base. He ended the season batting .247/.299/.335 while establishing career bests in at-bats (582), runs (85), hits (144), triples (11), and a career high in strikeouts (133). He also went 59/72 in stolen base attempts. Balls he hit had the second-lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (78.6 miles per hour), and he had the sixth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (30.1 feet per second).\nIn 2018, Hamilton led all NL outfielders with 12 assists, but struggled offensively all season, hitting just .236/.299/.327 with 132 strikeouts while going 34/44 in stolen base attempts. Balls he hit had the lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (79.4 miles per hour), and he had the fifth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (30.1 feet per second). He earned $4.6 million. Reds general manager Nick Krall said he tried to trade Hamilton, but there was no interest on the part of other teams. After the 2018 season, the Reds non-tendered Hamilton, making him a free agent.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn December 11, 2018, Hamilton signed a one-year $5.25 million contract that included up to $1 million in incentives with a mutual option for the 2020 season, with the Kansas City Royals. On August 16, 2019, Hamilton was designated for assignment.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn August 19, 2019, Hamilton was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Braves.\nIn 2019, between the two teams he batted .218/.289/.275 in 316 at-bats, with 22 stolen bases in 28 attempts. Balls he hit again had the lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (78.3 miles per hour), and he had the lowest percentage of hard hit balls of any major leaguer (7.3%).\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn February 7, 2020, Hamilton signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. He never appeared in a game at the Major League level for the Giants after the restart.\nNew York Mets.\nOn August 2, 2020, the Giants traded Hamilton to the New York Mets in exchange for Jordan Humphreys. On August 4, Hamilton was selected to the active roster. On September 3 during a Subway Series with the New York Yankees leading the Mets 7–6, Hamilton replaced Jeff McNeil as a pinch runner at the bottom the ninth inning. He forced Aroldis Chapman to balk and advanced to 2nd base, however was caught stealing 3rd base (with no outs).

They were the first Asian Games to be held in a non-capital city. The main theme of this edition was to promote peace and harmony among Asian nations. It was emphasized by the host because the venue was the site of the first atomic bomb attack in 1945. A total of 6,828 athletes from 42 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 34 sports. Baseball, Karate, Modern Pentathlon and Soft tennis were included for the first time. This medal table ranks the participating NOCs by the number of gold medals won by their athletes.\nAthletes from 32 participating NOCs won at least one medal; athletes from 20 of these NOCs secured at least one gold. Athletes from China won 125 gold medals, the most of any nation at these Asiad. Host nation Japan finished second in total medals. South Korea finished third in total medals. Kazakhstan, which participated for the first time, finished fourth.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with Olympic Council of Asia convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

        "text": " \nBadminton is a popular sport in India. Badminton in India is managed by the Badminton Association of India.\nIndian shuttlers P. V. Sindhu, Lakshya Sen, H. S. Prannoy, and the doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty are ranked amongst the Top-10 in the current BWF world rankings. Prakash Padukone was the first player from India to achieve the world no. 1 spot in the game, after which Srikanth Kidambi became the second male player to make it to the top spot in April 2018. Saina Nehwal is the first female player from India to achieve the world no. 1 spot, which she did in April 2015, and the first Indian badminton player to win a medal at the Olympic Games.\nP. V. Sindhu is the first Indian to become the badminton World Champion, which she achieved in 2019, and the only badminton player from India to win two consecutive medals at the Olympic Games.\nThe most successful doubles player from India is Jwala Gutta, who is the only Indian to have been ranked in the Top-10 of two categories. She peaked at no. 6 with Valiyaveetil Diju in mixed doubles and at no. 10 with Ashwini Ponnappa in women's doubles.\nOther successful players include Pullela Gopichand, Aparna Popat, Syed Modi, Nandu Natekar, Chetan Anand, Parupalli Kashyap, B.

        "text": "Golf in India is a growing sport. Golf is especially popular among the wealthier classes, but has not yet caught on with others due to the expenses involved in playing.\nThe most successful Indian golfers are Jeev Milkha Singh and Anirban Lahiri. Singh has won three titles on the European Tour, four on the Japan Golf Tour, and six on the Asian Tour. His highest world ranking to date is 28th, achieved in March 2009. Singh has won the Asian Tour Order of Merit twice. Meanwhile, Lahiri has two European Tour wins and seven Asian Tour wins. He qualified for the 2015 Presidents Cup.\nOther Indians who have won the Asian Tour Order of Merit are Jyoti Randhawa in 2002 (the first Indian to achieve this) and Arjun Atwal, who went on in 2010 to become the first India-born player to become a member of the US-based PGA Tour and win the 2010 Wyndham Championship.\nIndia's men's team won gold at the 1982 Asian Games. They also won silver at the 2006 Asian Games and 2010 Asian Games. Lakshman Singh won the individual gold medal at the 1982 Asian Games. Shiv Kapur won the individual gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games.\nThere are numerous golf courses all over India. There is a Professional Golf Tour of India. The main tournament is the Hero Indian Open, co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour.\nIn addition to the commendable performances by the golf players of India, the Indian Golf Union (IGU) is making earnest efforts to improve the standard of the game in the country. Established in 1955, IGU made a significant decision in 1995, which gave rise to the birth of a separate body for the sport - Professional Golfers' Association of India (PGAI). Recent development in Indian golf is commencement of Indian Pitch and Putt Union, apex body of Pitch and Putt Golf in India, and membership of International Pitch and Putt Association. The effort of IPPU to support golf infrastructure in India is also appreciated by World Golf Foundation; In his letter to IPPU Secretary General Rakesh Purohit, Steve Mona, CEO of WGF, gave his support and encouraged the program of IPPU to develop Pitch and Putt Golf in India. The Indian Golf Union ( IGU ) and HVR SPORTS (Chairman: Harshavardhan Reddy) have come out with new schemes to grow the sport in India.\nMajor Golf Tournaments in India.\n2014 season on the professional tour had 24 tournaments. SAIL-SBI Open, and the Panasonic Open were co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and the Take Solutions India Masters was co-sanctioned by the Asian Development Tour. BILT Open, CG Open, Louis Philippe Cup, TATA Open and the Mcleod Russel Tour Championship were the ones with the highest Prize monies. The 2015 Hero Indian Open is co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and the European Tour.\nThe Expat Cup, The Bonallack Trophy, SAIL Open, DLF Women's Indian Open, The India Golf Festival, Corporate Team Challenge, Kashmir Golf Festival, Take Solutions World Corporate Golf Challenge, The Toyota Golf Festival, Mercedes Trophy, Citibank World Golfers Championship, ICICI Bank Private Banking Masters, The ICICI Bank International Pro-Am, The British Airways Executive Challenge, The World NRI Challenge, Barclays Invitational,\nGolf Infrastructure in India.\nIndia currently has 196 registered golf courses and around 50% of those registered courses are situated on military bases, which are only accessible to military. 35 additional courses are un-affiliated (approx 17 Pitch and Putt Courses). This leaves roughly 135 courses to cater for a civilian golf demand.\nThe makeup of the golf course supply is split between 18-hole (39% share) and 9-hole (60% share) facilities, with three 27-hole clubs. \nResearch collected for KPMG's Golf Benchmark Survey indicates that the average number of rounds played per annum at 18-hole facilities ranges from 25,000 to 30,000 (excluding military courses). At some of the busier clubs where floodlights are used, hours can be extended to accommodate a higher demand. \nAverage annual revenues for both 9- and 18-hole courses range US$180,000–200,000 (excluding military courses) with some larger, more popular clubs reaching anywhere up to $800,000 per year.\nAnother major challenge India faces today in developing golf courses is the inability to acquire land in both a cost- and time-efficient manner. Land parcels are generally small, and developers need to purchase multiple plots at a cost that can quickly inflate. The initial steps taken when planning a project with a golf component can be time-consuming, expensive and misunderstood, delaying developments and have, in some instances, resulted in the omission of golf from project master plans.\nIndia may need to build up to 100 new courses to satisfy the demand over the next decade. An increase in participation can be achieved by:\nFuture course development seems inevitable and may need to come, hand-in-hand with real estate opportunity. Provided that the challenges that exist in India can be overcome, there is great potential in this growing golf market."

        "text": "Baseball is played in local clubs, schools and at the university level in India.\nHistory.\nBaseball was played in Manipur as early as World War II when the US Army Air Force flew supplies to China over the Himalayas, known as \"Flying the Hump\", and the locals learned the game from the troops stationed there.\nThe Amateur Baseball Federation of India was founded in 1983 and India's first national baseball championship occurred in 1985, taking place in New Delhi. That same year, it joined both the International Baseball Federation along with the Baseball Federation of Asia. In 2006, MLB International sent Envoy coaches to India to train local coaches and players in partnership with First Pitch, an India-based grass-roots baseball organisation.\nThe first ballpark in India was opened on 5 February 2017 at a farmhouse on the Gurgaon-Delhi border by Grand Slam Baseball and recognised by WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari. Built by social entrepreneur and baseball enthusiast Raunaq Sahni, India's first and only regulation-size baseball ground is named Field of Dreams in homage to the 1989 American film of the same name. Sahni had set up Grand Slam Baseball in 2013 as a grass-roots sports initiative to help organise tournaments and coaching programmes for youths across the country. Before the birth of Grand Slam Baseball, the sport was mostly played among expats and among government school players. Grand Slam Baseball changed this by starting pay-for-play programmes at elite private schools in Delhi-NCR while also sponsoring an equal number of government school players.\nIn July 2019, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced plans to open an office in New Delhi to promote the growth of baseball in India. The league also announced to plans to stream one regular season game a week on Facebook in India. MLB also stated that it would relaunch \"Million Dollar Arm\" holding tryouts in India between September and December 2019. MLB also announced the launch of First Pitch, a grassroots program for primary school children from 300 schools across New Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai to learn baseball through workshops by MLB coaches. MLB has said that there may be collaboration with BCCI to increase the spread of both cricket and baseball. \n\"Million Dollar Arm\".\nIn 2007, struggling MLB agent J.B. Bernstein decided to start a competition in India titled \"Million Dollar Arm\", a talent search for the best throwing arms in India. He gained his inspiration after watching ESPN's broadcast of a cricket match featuring bowlers that bowled at speeds as high as and realising that India was one of the largest untapped environments for baseball. Despite being inspired by cricketers, the two winners were 19-year-old javelin throwers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. Although he did not reach the million-dollar mark, Singh won US$100,000 for the fastest delivery of the contest and Patel won US$5,000. They were also invited to the United States to train and try out for Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. Eventually, both pitchers were signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates organisation and became the first two Indians to play professional baseball.\nPatel ended up having a successful 2009 season for Pirates' Gulf Coast League team, finishing with a 1–0 record and a 1.42 ERA in innings pitched. His 2010 season was not successful, with his ERA going up to 8.59 in innings. He was released after the season and returned to India to teach baseball and prepare kids for subsequent seasons of \"Million Dollar Arm\".\nThe screen rights to their story were purchased in 2009, and in 2014 Disney released the film titled \"Million Dollar Arm\". It made $3.9 crore off a budget of $2.5 crore."

He played college football at California, and was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft. He was also a member of the Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers, and Arizona Cardinals.\nEarly years.\nCampbell played high school basketball and football at Cheyenne High School in North Las Vegas, Nevada, where he was a two-time first-team All-State selection in the latter sport. As a senior cornerback, Campbell led his team with 61 tackles and had eight interceptions, including four returned for touchdowns. He was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 3 prospect in the state.\nCollege career.\nCampbell played college football at California after also receiving 39 scholarship offers from schools such as Arizona State, Fresno State, Nevada, UNLV and UTEP. In four seasons at Cal, Campbell started 14 of 46 games played and totaled 110 tackles (4.5 for a loss), two sacks, two interceptions, seven pass breakups, one forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries.\nAfter being named Scout Team Player of the Year while redshirting in 2007, Campbell played in 23 games during his first two seasons and totaled 18 tackles. He had 21 tackles in 12 games as a junior in 2010, making his first career start at Washington State.\nCampbell became a full-time starter at safety as a senior in 2011, opening all 13 contests and recording 71 tackles and two interceptions in his way to being named an honorable mention All-Pac-12.\nProfessional career.\n2012 NFL Draft.\nPrior to the 2012 NFL Draft, Campbell ran a 4.51 40-yard dash and posted a 38-inch vertical leap at Cal's Pro Day. His 22 bench press reps of 225 pounds would have tied for first among safeties at the 2012 NFL Scouting Combine. Projected by \"Pro Football Weekly\" as a late-round pick, Campbell had a pre-draft visit with the Dallas Cowboys visit in April.\nOn April 28, Campbell was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round (216th overall) of the 2012 NFL Draft. He was the Panthers' seventh and final selection of the draft and joined cornerback Josh Norman as one of two defensive backs selected by the team.\nCarolina Panthers.\nCampbell agreed to terms on a four-year contract with the Panthers on May 10, 2012. As a rookie, he was inactive for the first 11 regular season contests of the year, but ended up starting four of the final five games at strong safety due to an injury to Charles Godfrey. The Panthers won each of his starts, ending the season on a four-game winning streak as Campbell finished his rookie campaign with 12 tackled and a pass defensed.\nIn 2013, Campbell lost a competition for the Panthers' starting strong safety job to Mike Mitchell during the preseason and eventually landed on injured reserve with a leg injury. He was waived with an injury settlement on September 9, making him a free agent.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThe Miami Dolphins signed Campbell to their practice squad on October 18, 2013. On November 11, he was promoted to the active roster to replace waived safety Jordan Kovacs prior to the Dolphins' Monday Night Football meeting with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nCampbell signed a one-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers on January 7, 2014. The 49ers waived Campbell on August 25, 2014.\nArizona Cardinals.\nOn February 4, 2015, Campbell was signed by the Arizona Cardinals. On August 11, 2015, he was released by the Cardinals.\nPersonal life.\nCampbell has an older sister and a younger brother. When he was six years old, his 27-year-old mother, Deborah, suffered a fatal gunshot wound. As a result of the killing, his father, Darion Sr., was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served 13 years in prison and his uncle, Uricos, was convicted of second-degree murder. Campbell, Jr. and his two siblings later lived with his aunt, Valencia, and his uncle.\nCampbell considers himself an Atlanta Braves fan, which stems from memories of his later mother. He majored in social welfare at California, Berkeley."

        "text": "Markus Kuhn (born 5 May 1986) is a former German gridiron football defensive tackle. He was selected by the New York Giants in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft. In December 2014 he recovered a fumble against the Tennessee Titans and scored, becoming the first German to earn an NFL touchdown. Kuhn played college football at NC State.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Mannheim, Germany, Kuhn started playing football at age 14. He was introduced to the sport while spending vacations with his family in Florida. His interest and curiosity led him to start playing football in Germany and he eventually began playing linebacker and defensive tackle for the Weinheim Longhorns, winning Rookie of The Year. Kuhn was a four-time German Football League All-Star.\nCollege career.\nIn 2007 Kuhn decided to play collegiate football. Without access to college recruiters, Kuhn resorted to personally visiting colleges with his father in 2007. He was ultimately given a scholarship at North Carolina State University. At NC State, Kuhn was part of the Champs Sports Bowl-winning team in 2010 and the Belk Bowl-winning team in 2011. In 2012 Kuhn earned a degree in business economics.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\n2012 season.\nKuhn was drafted in the seventh round of the 2012 NFL Draft by the New York Giants.\nOn August 31, 2012, it was announced that Kuhn had made the final roster. He made his debut in the season's inaugural game with a tackle assist, a feat he matched in the subsequent games. He started his first game in Week 6 against Cleveland Browns. During the game against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 10, Kuhn suffered a torn ACL and missed the rest of the 2012 season. The Giants finished the season 9-7 and out of the playoffs.\n2013 season.\nAlmost one year after his ACL tear, Kuhn returned to practicing with his team. Because of his strong work ethic, the coaches named Kuhn on November 6 to the Giants active roster. Kuhn had his season debut in Week 13 against the Washington Redskins, a game the Giants won. In week 14, defensive tackle Kuhn returned a kickoff 13 yards, after the San Diego Chargers deliberately bounced a short kick, after a score with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. Kuhn and the Giants ended the season 7-9, failing to make the playoffs.\n2014 season.\nDuring the offseason, it was published that Kuhn has a good friendship with former Giant and 2014 Hall of Famer Michael Strahan. Kuhn was born in Mannheim and Strahan experienced the game of football in this city for the first time at the Mannheim Redskins (now the Rhein Neckar Bandits). In Week one, the Giants lost against the Detroit Lions. Kuhn missed the game because of an injury.\nIn week 14, on December 7, 2014, Kuhn returned a fumble 26 yards for a touchdown against the Titans. It was the Giants first non-offensive TD of the season. It was also the first ever touchdown scored by a German national in the NFL.\n2015 season.\nAhead of the 2015 season it was announced that the 2015 NFL season would see a new broadcasting arrangement in Germany with (at least) two games every Sunday being broadcast live in free-to-air Television on ProSieben Maxx as well as on a free live stream on ran.de. Kuhn became a columnist for the website of ran.de, describing his day-to-day life in the NFL and how he sees his games. On the field the 2015 season saw him secure the ball one more time for his team, when he returned a fumble by Tom Brady against the New England Patriots, a game that the Giants ultimately lost on a late field goal. On December 25, 2015, Kuhn was placed on injured reserve due to a knee injury he suffered against the Miami Dolphins on December 14, 2015.\nNew England Patriots.\nOn April 7, 2016, Kuhn signed with the New England Patriots. On September 3, 2016, he was released by the Patriots as part of final roster cuts.\nRetirement.\nOn January 27, 2017, Kuhn announced his retirement, never having played in a regular season game since being injured on December 14, 2015."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in India in 1979–80",
        "text": "The Australian cricket team toured India in 1979 to play a six-match Test series against India.\nIndia won the series 2–0. It was the last series played by an Australian side before the compromise agreement between the Australian Cricket Board and World Series Cricket. It was the first time India had beaten Australia in a series.\nAustralian squad.\nAustralia had just lost the Ashes to England 5-1 and drawn against Pakistan 1-1 during the 1978–79 summer. They had also finished a poor 1979 World Cup campaign.\nThe squad selected by Ray Lindwall, Sam Loxton and Phil Ridings were as follows:\nThe team was very inexperienced, with ten of the players never having toured before, and none having gone to India. Jeff Moss, Trevor Laughlin and Gary Cosier, who had been part of the 1979 World Cup squad, were not selected – they were replaced by Wood, Higgs, Sleep and Yardley. Peter Toohey, who had impressed with the bat in Australia's 3–2 victory over India in 1977–78, was also overlooked due to a poor 1978–79 test season. John Inverarity, the highly experienced Western Australian captain and former test player, appears never to have been considered for selection, despite a fine domestic season of cricket in 1978–79.\nCaptaincy.\nAlthough Graham Yallop had captained Australia during the 1978–79 summer, he was replaced by Kim Hughes when injured, and when Yallop returned to the side, the Australian Cricket Board decided to persist with Hughes. They also elected Hilditch as vice captain rather than Yallop. However Yallop was kept as a selector.\nOn-tour selection panel: Hughes, Hilditch, Yallop.\nReplacements.\nAlan Hurst suffered a back injury during the tour. On 16 October it was decided he would return home and Geoff Lawson was flown out as a replacement bowler during the tour.\nWorld Series Cricket Backdrop.\nBefore the tour took place, establishment cricket had \"made up\" with World Series Cricket and the 1979–80 Australian summer season was to be the first in three years with all players in the one competition. However, World Series Cricket players were not selected on the India tour. The scheduling of the tour meant that the players chosen to go to India would miss out on the first round of Sheffield Shield games in Australia and only have two weeks to press their claims for selection before the first test in Australia.\nCricket writer Samir Chopra later wrote:\nThe names of the tourists that year were a mixture of the giggle-inducing and the dramatic. It was the autumn of 1979, and the last Packer-depleted Australia side to turn out for the ACB was in India. Those of us that greeted them that year knew little of what reluctant tourists they were, about how they felt cheated and betrayed by their overlords, and how they griped and belly-ached about their touring and playing conditions... All we knew was that Indian cricket was suspended in a bizarre netherworld, one where the world's best cricket players all seemed to be playing in a poorly attended circus in Australia, while second-stringers were sent to our shores. But I still thought the Packer players were mercenaries and still paid obeisance to nation-based cricket, so these players were going to get all my attention.\nTour.\nThe Australian team left for Madras on 21 August. Hughes:\nIt will be a great experience for us to play in India — an Australian team hasn't been there for 10 years. It will be a real challenge as India is certain to be very hard to beat on its home grounds... We will have plenty of eye-catching performances in both batting and bowling and I'm sure paceman Rodney Hogg is going to be a success on Indian wickets along with spinners Jim Higgs, Peter Sleep and Bruce Yardley. I feel that players of the class of all-rounder Allan Border, batsmen Rick Darling and Graham Yallop and hopefully myself, will produce efforts that will win us matches and also please the crowds.\nThe team was on a plane when the engine blew one hour out of Singapore and had to return. This meant the Australians arrived in India 22 hours behind schedule.\nThe Australians spent a week in Madras to acclimatise. After arriving at Madras, Rick Darling and Jim Higgs both fell sick with stomach ailments. However the mood was optimistic and the key players seemed in good form at practice sessions. According to one report:\nYallop, in particular, is in masterly touch. His driving today was fluent and effortless, and his teammates agree he had never been batting better. In that sort of form, he is destined to score a lot of runs on this tour. Hughes is always busy at the nets, offering advice and encouragement to his players. He gave Allan Hurst a private batting clinic today and then turned his attention to Sleep, who is gradually getting his confidence back after a difficult beginning to the tour.\nNorth Zone vs Australia.\nThe first game of the tour was against North Zone in Srinagar, 1,600 miles from Madras. The ACB requested the game be relocated closer to Madras to reduce travel time and because Sringara was politically volatile due to the Kashmir situation, but this was knocked back as it was the first time a visiting test team had played in Kashmir and advance ticket sales were heavy.\nRodney Hogg and Graeme Wood pulled out prior to the game due to illness. There was heavy security due to threats to kill the Australians from the Pakistan-based Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front.\nRuns were scored by Hilditch (71), Hughes (70) and Yallop (83) with Hilditch and Rick Darling having a 75 run opening stand in 90 minutes. Hurst took 5-33 and Dymock 4-25 (twice dismissing Arun Lal – who scored 99 – on no balls). The game was drawn.\nSouth Zone vs Australia.\nThe next game took place against South Zone in Hyderabad. Hogg, Higgs and Sleep all took three wickets in South Zone's first innings. Allan Border scored 113 – his first decent score since his debut century against Pakistan – and Yallop made another half century; Kevin Wright made 52. The match was interrupted by rain and Australia were unable to force a victory, although Higgs and Sleep both picked up two extra wickets in South Zone's second innings.\nRodney Hogg had taken four wickets in all despite being pelted by fruit and other missiles during the game, resulting in Hughes asking the police to stop them. Hogg was hit by an apple core on the final day, which he threw back into the crowd. This inspired more items to be thrown at him – a large stone hit him in the groin.\nIt was felt by contemporary reports that Higgs out-bowled Sleep:\nSleep also took five wickets, but three of them were from loose deliveries which a batsman of Gavaskar's class would put away. He does have the happy knack of taking wickets with bad balls, but there are doubts about his ability to bowl tightly enough against batsmen who were brought up playing spin bowling.\nRick Darling was cut over the left eye while fielding and needed stitches, meaning he was unable to bat at all. The selectors had wanted to experiment with Graeme Wood at six but Darling's injury meant Wood had to open. The game also saw Graeme Porter make his first class debut for Australia.\nFirst Test.\nRick Darling's illness was a headache for the Australian selectors – he was first choice opener with Wood as a backup, and either Wood or Dav Whatmore to bat at six. Hughes wanted to take three pacemen into the test, Dymock, Hurst and Hogg, leaving room for one spinner – Higgs. Eventually Darling was ruled out and Wood and Whatmore were selected, with Yardley as 12th man.\nIndia kept a similar team to that which had played in England, with Dilip Doshi making his test debut. According to \"Wisden\":\nIronically, the Australians were better acclimatised than the home side, having practised in these conditions for almost a week, with two pre-Test matches. The Indians, however, had just returned from England, the Test match starting only a week after the end of the epic fourth test at The Oval. Besides being travel-weary, they had to adjust hurriedly to vast differences in weather, light and pitch conditions.\nAustralia began well with centuries to Border (162) and Hughes (100), who had a record third wicket partnership of 222. The other Australians batted less well (although several made starts), with Doshi taking 6–103. India scored 425 in reply, with Kapil Dev making 83 off 73 balls; Jim Higgs took 7–143. Hogg made 2-85. According to \"Wisden\":\nThe presence of Hogg in the Australian attack presumably influenced the preparation of a pitch slower than usual at Chepauk. As it was the Indians were hardly disconcerted by Hogg who, apart from being unable to achieve any pace, had immense trouble in keeping his front foot behind the popping crease. The bowler to test the Indian batting was Higgs, who was remarkably tidy for a leg-spinner... suffering only at the hands of Kapil Dev.\nAll the Australian bowlers struggled in the heat, and Higgs at times struggled to grip the ball; Hogg was also plagued with no balls. Border and Yallop both bowled and Yallop took a wicket.\nAustralia responded well in the second innings at first, with Hilditch and Border scoring half centuries as they went to 1–103. However a collapse saw Australia crash to 7–175, a lead of only a 140 with a session and a half to go. \"When I got out I thought that was it\", admitted Hughes later.\nHowever Geoff Dymock and Rodney Hogg held out for an hour, then the match was washed out with rain and ended in a draw.\nHughes later said he felt Australia were lucky to draw. \"We were in a golden position on the first day, and half way through the second day, but we blew it\", he said. \"We should have got ourselves into a position where we couldn't lose, and then kept the pressure on India... Obviously we'll be paying a lot of attention to our batting. I thought the top-order batsmen were very disappointing\".\nSecond Test.\nThere were some doubts the second test would start as scheduled due to a monsoon.\nRick Darling replaced Whatmore in the side, with Wood dropping down to number six. Bruce Yardley came in for Dymock. Shivlav Ladal made his test debut for India.\nAustralia won the toss and batted, with Hilditch and Hughes scoring half centuries. However they collaposed to be 5–294 to 333 all out. India's innings was marked by problems involving Rodney Hogg. According to \"Wisden\":\nHogg could not work up speed, and at the start of the Indian innings again had trouble landing his front foot in the right place. After being no balled seven times in five overs delivered from different ends, Hogg lost his temper on the second evening and kicked down the stumps. The incident would have fouled the atmosphere had Hughes not taken prompt action, tendering an immediate apology to the umpire and persuading Hogg to express his regret at the end of the day's play. \nBob Merriman later announced that it was decided no disciplinary action would be taken against Hogg. He wound up with figures of 0-118 off 32 overs, the first time he had failed to take a wicket in a test. Hurst took 0-93; Yardley had figures of 4–107, but was too ill to bowl towards the end as India declared at 5–457.\nRick Darling had left the field while Australia was fielding and was too ill to open so Wood took his place. Australia were 3–77 in reply, 47 behind India's first innings total, at tea on the fifth day, when a rain storm caused the game to be abandoned. Yadav ended up taking 7-87 for the match.\nAustralia vs Central Zone.\nAustralia then travelled to Nagpur for a tour game against Central Zone. Peter Sleep threw his name into consideration with 5-71 and 61 not out; Darling (82) and Whatmore (60) also found form in a drawn game. Hogg however only took 1-39 and 1-13 and there were doubts raised about whether he should be picked – the first time this had happened in his career. \"It's something new for him and it will be important for us to see how he handles it\", said Hughes. However Hurst's back was playing up and he was advised to rest; this made Hogg's selection more imperative.\nThird Test.\nAustralia kept faith with Hogg for the third test, bringing in Dymock to replace Hurst. India won the toss and elected to bat; they were 1-201 but the Australian attack fired and they were dismissed for 271, Dymock taking 5-99 and Hogg 4-66 (though he was still no balled 13 times in 15 overs). Darling had more health issues, injuring his shoulder while fielding and having to leave the ground; it turned out to be sprained, and Darling batted down the order, with Bruce Yardley opening.\nAustralia were unable to press the advantage although they managed to score 304, led by Yallop (89), Hughes (50) and Darling (59); for a time it seemed Darling was not going to be able to bat but he decided to try and ended up lasting three hours.\nIndia batted well in their second innings making 311. Dymock took 7/67 but Australia dropped a number of key catches which later proved crucial.\nAustralia were set the task of getting 279 in 310 minutes. Allan Border was suffering from flu so Yallop batted at three (Border came in at six). The Australians collapsed and were all out for 125, Dev and Yadav taking four wickets each.\nTo make things worse for Australia, Bruce Yardley was injured when a Kapil Dev yorker struck him on the big toe of the left foot, causing him to swell up and putting him in doubt for the fourth test.\nAustralia vs West Zone.\nThe next game was against West Zone. Hughes scored 126 but the rest of the batsmen failed. West Zone were dismissed for 217 with Sleep and Higgs taking three wickets each – and Graeme Wood a career-best 3–18. Australia made 9–143 in their second innings (Whatmore 41), then Border and Higgs each took three wickets as they almost bowled Australia to victory, the game ending with West Zone 7-95.\nAlan Hurst had returned to the Australian side for the game but it became apparent the injury was getting worse. It was decided that he should be sent home after the fourth test and be replaced by Geoff Lawson. Hughes:\nHe really struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but it's no use now. He might have to have a complete rest if he wants to do himself justice. There's no point in him staying in India if he can't bowl. He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do himself permanent damage. He hadn't done any work at all for a week, and he's now as unfit as he has ever been in his career.\nBob Merriman said Hurst was:\nBitterly disappointed. It's a shame for this to happen to Alan. He's no sloucher. I don't think he's ever come off a cricket ground in his life. He will be staying with us throughout the fourth Test. With Bruce Yardley also injured, Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's the sort of person he is.\nFourth Test.\nAustralia replaced Bruce Yardley with Peter Sleep. Gavaskar (dropped on 13), Viswanath and Sharma all scored centuries as India made 7–510, with Dymock taking 4–135. Australia made 298 in response due to fine innings from Whatmore (77) and Wright (55); Kapil Dev took 5-82; Graham Yallop had to bat in a different position due to illness.\nIndia enforced the follow on. Australia managed to bat to safety with a total of 413 with good innings from Hilditch (85), Hughes (40), Border (46), Whatmore (54) and Sleep (64). The partnership of Whatmore and Sleep in particular – 76 off 102 minutes – was especially crucial. Both Wright and Higgs were severely ill due to stomach upsets.\nHughes called this effort \"the best all-round team effort from any side that I've ever played in, especially considering all the circumstances\".\nEast Zone vs Australia.\nAustralia played East Zone in Cuttack with Geoff Lawson joining the team; Kevin Wright was rested for the first time on tour, with Graham Yallop taking the gloves.\nAustralia scored 5-160 (Yallop 81 not out) when Hughes declared; East Zone were dismissed for 126 in return; Australia were 8-119 when Hughes declared again, 50 minutes before tea. This gave East Zone a day and a half to score 153 runs. Hughes explained the generosity of this declaration by stating he was unhappy with the quality of the Cuttack pitch, saying it was one of the worst he had ever played on, and thus of limited use to his team; the idea was to win in two games to give the side more time to prepare for the test match in Calcutta. It did not work out that way; East Zone were 4-111 by the end of that day and ended up winning the game by four wickets (two catches were dropped).\nFifth Test.\nAustralia made only one change for the fifth test team, bringing Bruce Yardley back for Peter Sleep. Initially the Australians were reluctant to use a still-injured Yardley but a look at the spin friendly Eden Gardens pitch made them change their minds. Hughes:\nIt's a certainty that Yardley is going to have to play on this wicket. Obviously he will have some pain, but he will not do any irreparable damage. The results of another x-ray on the toe have given him cause for optimism and he is pleased in his own mind. He has experienced some discomfort in the nets, but it's not enough to stop him playing. He's a must in the team and I'm sure he can do the job.\nAustralia batted extremely well in their first innings, making 442 thanks to Yallop (167) (as opener), Hughes (92), Border (54), and Yardley (61). Indian managed 347 in reply, collapsing from 2–256 with Yardley getting 4-91.\nAustralia were 5–81 in reply in one stage, in danger of losing, but Hughes started hitting out and Australia added 70 in 72 minutes. Hughes declared (he was on 64 not out), leaving India to get 246 runs in 247 minutes. Geoff Dymock took four wickets and at one stage India were 4-123 but Yashpal Sharma and Rao dug in and the game ended drawn, with them 4–200. According to \"Wisden\":\nAlthough the ball had turned on the fourth day – a factor in Hughes's declaration – the heavy roller produced a calmer pitch on the final day. Lacking in bounce, it was of little use to the wrist-spin of Higgs, and Australia's only finger-spinner, Yardley, failed to reproduce his form of the Indian first innings.\nSixth Test.\nAustralia made one change for the sixth test, bringing back Sleep for Bruce Yardley, after the latter failed a fitness test. India won the toss and decided to bat, making 8–458, with both Gavaskar and Kirmani scoring centuries. Graham Yallop and Sleep both had to leave the ground during the day due to illness.\nAustralia were dismissed for 160, with only Yallop (60) offering much resistance. According to \"Wisden\", \"the Australians were upset by two umpiring decisions during this innings. Hilditch was aggrieved at being given run out and Hughes was even less pleased to be given out caught at silly point. There was a red patch on his shirt-sleeve to provide evidence that justice had not been done.\"\nAustralia were 2–149 in their second innings (Border 61, Hughes 80) but then collapsed to be all out for 198 and lost by an innings and 100 runs. \"Wisden\" later called Hughes' knock \"one of the finest innings played against Indian bowling in recent times.\"\nDuring the second innings, Dev felled Rick Darling with a bouncer, causing him to be retired hurt.\nSummary.\nThe tour established Kim Hughes and Allan Border as test batsmen. However it was a disappointing tour for Australian strike bowler Rodney Hogg.\nHughes thought key problems were the failure of the Australian openers to get off to a good start, and dropping of crucial catches. Hughes:\nNot enough of us came up to scratch... Rodney Hogg was disappointing. He took a long while to get to grips with the conditions. We expected our openers to play an important role, but Rick Darling, Andrew Hilditch and Graeme Wood struggled the whole way. That was a big blow to us.\nIn the words of Samir Chopra:\nThe series had many moments of personal success for Hughes' team, but the Australians were always just a bit outgunned and outmatched, and given that they were never very happy, the result was a foregone conclusion. Still, they showed fight, their batsmen played spin reasonably (Border and Hughes especially well), and their captain showed himself to be more enterprising than his Indian counterpart. As was their wont, and still is now, India failed to win more comprehensively against a much weaker team.\n\"Wisden\" summed up the tour for the Australians:\nThe main Australian gain of the tour was the tremendous advance made by two batsmen, Hughes and Border. Between the first Test and the last there was a marked development in Hughes's technique of playing spin bowling, and happily the heavy burden of captaincy had no adverse effect on his batting... He passed the half-century mark in every Test but one and could certainly have made more runs had he not batted as positively and purposefully as he did. Border... started the series more strongly than he finished it. But as his form declined, another left-hander, Yallop, came into his own. The most experienced player in the side, Yallop was at his best when batting conditions were most difficult. In the last two Tests, he opened the innings and filled the rôle with distinction. If he did not make an earlier impact on the series it was partly because, more than once, he was dismissed in unfortunate ways. A major weakness of the Australian batting was its fragility at the top of the order... The best Australian opening partnership in the entire series was one of 32. Yet this was not Australia's only weakness, nor the most prominent. It was the lack of depth to their bowling and their generally poor out-cricket that put them at such a disadvantage. On the few occasions when their bowlers rose to any heights, they were let down by the fielders, with many more slip chances going down than were held. Fitness problems also were acute.\nBack in Australia, the next test played was against the West Indies. Eight of the twelve players selected were from World Series Cricket, including Greg Chappell as captain, but Hughes, Border, Hogg and Dymock were kept in the side and Hughes was appointed vice-captain."

        "title": "2015 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2015 Ashes series (named Investec Ashes Series for sponsorship reasons) was a series of Test cricket matches played between England and Australia for The Ashes. The venues were Sophia Gardens (Cardiff), Lord's (London), Edgbaston (Birmingham), Trent Bridge (Nottingham), and The Oval (London). Australia were the defending holders of the Ashes going into the series, having won in 2013–14.\nEngland won the series 3–2, regaining the Ashes after taking an unassailable lead with an innings victory in the fourth Test.\nRescheduling.\nStarting with this series, the four-year cycle of Ashes series in England was brought forward by two years. Similarly, series in Australia were brought forward one year beginning with the 2013–14 series. This rescheduling was to avoid a clash with the 2015 World Cup, which was hosted by Australia and New Zealand, and future World Cup preparations. England last hosted the Ashes in 2013. However, this rescheduling would cause England to host an Ashes series in 2019 immediately after the 2019 World Cup in England, resulting in a possible hindrance to Australia's Ashes preparations, despite the 2013–14 series being held a year earlier than scheduled to avoid the same outcome with the World Cup. The rescheduling has been criticised in some quarters as owing to greed and commercialism. The ECB have also commented that having three Ashes series in two years will also prevent any future Ashes series held in Australia from affecting World Cup preparations.\nSquads.\nOn 31 March 2015, Australia announced a 17-man touring party for the Ashes series. England announced their squad for the first Test on 1 July. Australia fast-bowler Ryan Harris announced his retirement from cricket days before the start of the series, due to an ongoing knee injury. He was subsequently replaced by New South Wales fast bowler Pat Cummins.\n1 Cummins replaced Ryan Harris, who retired prior to the start of the series due to a knee injury.\n2 Bairstow replaced Gary Ballance in the squad from the third Test onwards.\n3 Plunkett and Footitt replaced James Anderson in the squad for the fourth Test due to Anderson suffering an injury. Anderson returned to the squad in place of Footitt for the fifth Test.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nHaving been asked to field first by England, despite the start being delayed by a prolonged opening ceremony, the Australians made an early breakthrough with the wicket of Adam Lyth (6). The arrival of Gary Ballance saw a mini-partnership develop between him and captain Alastair Cook, before Cook (20) edged a ball from spinner Nathan Lyon to wicket-keeper Brad Haddin, followed almost immediately by Ian Bell (1), trapped LBW by Mitchell Starc. That brought Joe Root to the crease to join his Yorkshire teammate Ballance. In what was undoubtedly the turning point in the match, Haddin dropped a fairly regulation catch from the bowling of Starc on Root's second delivery. The dismissal would have reduced England to 43/4 after they chose to bat first, but after the let off the pair raced to their respective fifties, putting on 153 runs for the fourth wicket before Ballance was trapped LBW by Josh Hazlewood for 61. Root and Ben Stokes then shared a fifth-wicket stand of 84 before Root was caught out by Shane Watson off Starc for a total of 134, having rescued England from 43/3 to 280/5. Stokes completed his half-century before he was bowled by Starc for 52, and Jos Buttler was also out for 27 after a seventh-wicket stand of exactly 50 with Moeen Ali, but England managed to see out the day on 343/7.\nHaving been 26 not out overnight, Moeen Ali added another 51 runs on the morning of the second day before he was caught out by Watson off Starc. Stuart Broad's 18 was the only significant contribution to the England total among the tail, and Starc completed a five-wicket haul when he bowled James Anderson to end the England innings on 430. Australia made a steady start to their response, putting on 52 runs before David Warner was caught by Cook in the slips for 17. Next to go for Australia was Steve Smith, recently ranked as the best Test batsman in the world, caught at short mid-on by Cook off the bowling of Moeen Ali for 33. Meanwhile, Chris Rogers reached 95 before edging a ball from Mark Wood through to Buttler to become the first player to record seven consecutive Test fifties without converting one to a century; it was also Wood's maiden Ashes wicket. A second wicket for Moeen Ali soon followed, as he caught Australia captain Michael Clarke off his own bowling. A 50-run partnership between Adam Voges and Shane Watson for the fifth wicket was ended shortly before the end of the day, with Voges caught by Anderson off Stokes for 31, leaving Australia on 264/5 at the close of play.\nThe third morning started with two quick wickets, with Watson and nightwatchman Lyon departing for the addition of just one run. A flurry of runs from Haddin and Mitchell Johnson saw Australia pass 300, but the last two wickets fell for just four runs, and Australia were all out for 308, still 122 runs behind England. As England began their second innings, the Australians again made early breakthroughs, with Cook out for 12 and Ballance out for a duck, before Lyth and Bell shared a stand of 51 runs for the third wicket. The partnership was broken when Clarke made a one-handed catch to dismiss Lyth for 37, but Bell batted on to reach his first Test half-century in 10 innings. He and Root put on 97 for the fourth wicket before Bell was out for 60, bowled by Johnson for the Australian's first wicket of the match, following first-innings figures of 0/111. Root followed 11 overs later for exactly the same score off exactly the same number of balls, and dismissed in exactly the same manner by Hazlewood. Stokes then made a useful 42, but after the dismissal of Buttler (7), there was a clatter of wickets, reducing England from 236/5 to 245/8 in less than three overs. Wood hit a quickfire 32 not out off 18 balls to push England towards 300, but they were eventually bowled out for 289, a lead of 411. With rain forecast for the fifth day, England knew that they would have to bowl Australia out on day 4 to ensure victory.\nWith Australia chasing 412 to win, they lost Rogers for 10 early on, ending his record-equalling run of half-centuries, but a 78-run partnership between Warner and Smith looked to have stabilised the innings. The stand was broken by Moeen Ali in the final over before lunch, trapping Warner LBW for 52. Australia then lost Smith (33), Clarke (4) and Voges (1) in the five overs following the interval; in the space of six overs, they had fallen from 97/1 to 106/5. Haddin was next to go, caught at short midwicket by Cook for 7; the England captain parried the ball up at the first attempt, but retained his focus to cling on at the second time of asking. Watson (19) did his best to reignite the innings before being trapped LBW for the second time in the match, reducing Australia to 151/7. Johnson and Starc then shared a 72-run partnership for the eighth wicket, only for Root's off spin to find both their edges to leave the tourists 169 behind with one wicket in hand. Root was again involved in the final wicket, as Moeen Ali tempted Hazlewood into a big shot down the ground to long on, where Root was waiting to take the catch and seal victory. For his contributions primarily with the bat, but also with the ball, Root was named Man of the Match.\nSecond Test.\nAustralia won the toss and opted to bat first. After losing David Warner for 38, the duo of Chris Rogers and Steve Smith batted out the rest of day one and both scored hundreds in the process. Australia finished on 337/1 at stumps with Rogers on 158 and Smith on 129.\nStuart Broad ended the 284-run partnership by dismissing Rogers for 173 in the sixth over of the second day. Smith continued to amass runs even as wickets fell at the other end. A few overs before tea, Smith was dismissed leg before wicket for 215 by Joe Root. After a brisk 45 by debutant Peter Nevill, Australia decided to declare when their score was on 566/8. In reply, England were reduced to 30/4 as Australian fast bowlers delivered early breakthroughs. England captain Alastair Cook then stabilised the innings with Ben Stokes and took the score to 85/4 at the close of day's play.\nCook and Stokes continued to rebuild for England on the third day, but the wicket of Stokes just before lunch dented England's progress. Apart from a knock of 39 by Moeen Ali, Cook got little support from the remaining batsmen and was dismissed four runs short of a hundred. England were eventually bowled out for 312 after tea. Instead of enforcing the follow on, Australia decided to bat their second innings. Both their openers started to score rapidly and took the team score to 108 without loss at stumps.\nRogers was retired hurt for 49 early during the morning session of the fourth day but that did not halt the Australian onslaught. Australia batsmen continued to pile on quick runs as they attacked the England bowlers, increasing the lead. Warner was dismissed for 83, before an aggressive 48-ball 58 from Smith and quickfire cameos from Clarke and Mitchell Marsh had taken the visitors' total to 254/2 in just 49 overs when Clarke decided to declare. Being set an improbable target of 509 runs to be scored in five sessions, England started poorly with none of the top-order batsmen reaching 15. England were eventually bowled out in just 37 overs for 103. Australia thus leveled the series 1–1 with a 405-run victory and Smith was named player of the match.\nThird Test.\nSteven Finn came into the England team in place of Mark Wood. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first with an unchanged team. Australia were 72/3 at lunch before England fast bowlers took quick wickets in the second session to bowl Australia out for 136. James Anderson claimed six wickets, while Broad and Finn took two each. In reply, England rode on fifties from Ian Bell and Joe Root to finish the day at a solid position of 133/3, despite losing the wicket of Bell towards the end.\nAustralia made inroads on the second morning and reduced England to 190/7. An eighth-wicket stand of 87 runs between Moeen Ali and Broad gave England a healthy lead before Australia came back to dismiss the tail and end the innings at 281, a lead of 145 for England. In Australia's second innings, a devastating spell from Finn reduced Australia from 62/1 to 92/5, with five of the top six batsmen being dismissed for single-digit scores. David Warner counter-attacked for Australia with a 62-ball 77. Australia finished the second day on 168/7, only 23 runs ahead, with Finn having five wickets to his name and England in a very strong position. But during the day Anderson had to leave the match due to side strain and would not return.\nOn the morning of the third day, battling fifties from Peter Nevill and Mitchell Starc extended Australia's slender lead. England bowlers then came back to end the Australian innings at 265. Finn ended with career-best figures of 6/79. Chasing the target of 121 to win, England lost both openers cheaply, but unbeaten knocks of 65 from Bell and 38 from Root guided England to a comfortable victory by eight wickets, and a 2–1 series lead. Finn was awarded man of the match.\nFourth Test.\nEngland won the toss and elected to bowl first. England made one change to their team, replacing the injured James Anderson with Mark Wood, while Shaun Marsh replaced his brother Mitchell in the Australian side. Australia were bowled out before lunch on the first day for 60 in 18.3 overs, the fewest overs a team has been bowled out for in the first innings of a Test match. Stuart Broad picked up 8/15, the best bowling figures by a fast bowler in an Ashes Test, while extras outscored every one of Australia's batsmen with 14 (the top-scoring batsman was tail-ender Mitchell Johnson, with 13). In England's first innings, after Mitchell Starc took three early wickets, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow put up 173 runs for the fourth wicket. Bairstow was dismissed towards the end of first day and England were 274/4 at stumps.\nStarc dismissed Root for 130 and took two more wickets on the morning of the second day, but a quickfire lower-order partnership between Moeen Ali and Broad pushed England's total higher. England decided to declare at the brink of lunch when their total had reached 391/9. Australia's second innings began with a 113-run opening stand between Warner and Rogers. Ben Stokes took the first three Australian wickets and triggered a collapse. Adam Voges showed some resistance while wickets fell at the other end, taking Australia to 241/7 at the close of the day's play.\nEngland took just 10.2 overs on the third day to claim the remaining three Australian wickets. Australia were bowled out for 253, giving England a victory by an innings and 78 runs. Stokes had figures of 6/36 in the second innings and Broad was named man of the match. England regained the Ashes with a match to spare in the series, and Ian Bell became the first England player since Ian Botham to win five Ashes series. At the conclusion of the match, Australian captain Michael Clarke announced he would retire from international cricket after the series.\nFifth Test.\nJames Anderson was not passed fit for the fifth Test, so England named an unchanged side, denying Adil Rashid his home Test debut. For Australia, Josh Hazlewood was ruled out with an ankle injury, paving the way for Peter Siddle to make a long-awaited return to Test cricket ahead of Pat Cummins, despite media reports to the contrary before the match. Mitchell Marsh was recalled ahead of his brother Shaun, while Brad Haddin was not recalled for his possible final Test match.\nAustralia dominated the match right from the start with a century opening partnership between Warner and Rogers. Steven Smith scored his 11th test century as Australia finished their innings at 481. England's reply was lacking with them ending day 2 at 107/8. England, after being bowled out for 149 in their first innings, were asked to follow on. However, by the end of the third day an innings defeat was looming with England on 203/6 and still trailing by 129 runs. With the threat of rain washing out several sessions of the last two days, Australia started day 4 brightly and took two early wickets before rain brought an early lunch. After a lengthy lunch break, Siddle took the last two wickets to bring an end to an eventful series. This match marked the end of the international careers of both Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers.\nAftermath.\nThe Ashes trophy was presented to England immediately after their defeat in the fifth Test. This was criticised by \"The Guardian\"s Mike Selvey, who called the ceremony \"perhaps the most incongruous champagne shower in history\". Joe Root was awarded the Compton–Miller Medal for player of the series.\nAustralian players Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Shane Watson and Brad Haddin retired from Test cricket at the end of the series. England moved up to third in the ICC Test Championship (from sixth at the start of the series), but remained behind Australia who stayed in second place.\nCricket journalists gave a mixed opinion on the quality of the series, praising several good spells of bowling but criticising the poor standard of batting, which was seen as too aggressive and impatient for Test cricket. There was also disappointment that none of the matches lasted the full five days, with the result often obvious early on. Vic Marks said \"by the end of the second day of each match we always knew who was going to win; sometimes that was obvious by the end of the first day; at Nottingham by the first interval\"."
