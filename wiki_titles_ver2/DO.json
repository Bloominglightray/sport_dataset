        "text": "David Grace (born 5 May 1985) is an English professional snooker player and painter. After being a successful junior and amateur player, notably winning the English Amateur Championship in 2005 and 2008, he became a professional in 2008, gaining his place by winning the 2008 European Snooker Championships, where he beat Craig Steadman in the final.\nIn 2009, Grace took part in the men's singles snooker competition at the World Games in Kaohsiung, finishing as the runner-up in this event, winning the silver medal. He entered the 2015 UK Championship as the world number 81, but progressed through to his first ranking event semi-final which he lost 6–4 to Liang Wenbo. Grace fell off the tour in 2018, but regained his place on the tour in 2019 after finishing in the top two on the 2018–19 Challenge Tour ranking list. This earned him a two-year card for the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 seasons.\nCareer.\n2011/2012 season.\nAs a new player on the tour Grace would need to win four qualifying matches in order to reach the main draw of the ranking events. He failed to win more than one match in each of his first six attempts to do this until he played in the qualifying for the China Open. There he beat Daniel Wells, Barry Pinches and Matthew Selt, before losing 4–5 to Tom Ford in the final round.\nGrace played in all 12 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events throughout the season, with his best finishes coming in Event 10 and Event 12, where he reached the last 16. He was ranked 63rd in the PTC Order of Merit. Grace ended the season ranked world number 77 and would ordinarily be relegated from the snooker tour as he did not finish in the top 64 who retain their places. However, due to his performances in the PTC events, he earned his place for the 2012–13 season.\n2012/2013 season.\nGrace reached the final round of qualifying for the 2012 Shanghai Masters after seeing off Michael Leslie, Li Yan and Xiao Guodong, but was edged out 4–5 by former world champion Peter Ebdon just one match away from reaching the main stage of a ranking event for the first time.&lt;ref name=\"DG 2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He played in all ten Players Tour Championship events this season, where he enjoyed his best result in the PTC Event 1 by beating James Gillespie, Jimmy White and Gareth Allen, before losing to Jack Lisowski. Grace was placed 74th on the PTC Order of Merit. His season ended when he was beaten 9–10 by Craig Steadman in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. Grace fell 11 places in the rankings during the year to finish it world number 88.\n2013/2014 season.\nGrace went one better than last season in the qualifying rounds of the 2013 Shanghai Masters by winning four matches, concluding with a 5–2 victory over Tom Ford, to reach the main stage of a ranking event for the first time in his career where he was whitewashed 5–0 by Barry Hawkins.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his first match in all eight remaining ranking events after this. Grace also had his best form in the early part of the season in the European Tour events by reaching the last 16 of the second event, the Rotterdam Open, where he was beaten 4–1 by Mark Davis. This helped him to finish 53rd on the Order of Merit, which saw Grace earn a fresh two-year place on the tour for the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons.\n2014/2015 season.\nAt the minor-ranking Yixing Open, Grace won three matches to reach the last 16 where he was whitewashed 4–0 by Ryan Day.&lt;ref name=\"2014/15\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Grace qualified for the first ranking event of the 2014–15 season, the Wuxi Classic by beating Jimmy Robertson 5–4, but he lost 5–1 to Judd Trump. This last 64 appearance proved to be his best result in a ranking event this year.\n2015/2016 season.\nIn the qualifying rounds for the 2015 Shanghai Masters, Grace beat Joe O'Connor 5–3, Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 5–2 and Cao Yupeng 5–4 to reach the final round. He faced Ali Carter and defeated him 5–3, a victory he described as the best of his career afterwards. Grace was due to play Mark Selby in the first round, but he received a bye after Selby withdrew due to family bereavement. In the second round Grace was knocked out 5–1 by Mark Allen.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the UK Championship, Grace defeated Andrew Higginson 6–1, Robert Milkins 6–2, Jack Lisowski 6–4 and Peter Ebdon 6–2 to reach the quarter-finals of a ranking event for the first time in his career. He fell 5–1 down to Martin Gould, but remarkably won five successive frames to eliminate him 6–5. In the semi-finals, Grace built a 4–2 advantage over Liang Wenbo, but saw it erased to be 5–4 behind. He then missed a simple pink in the next frame which would have taken the match to a decider, stating afterwards that he had twitched on it. Despite this, Grace earned £30,000 for his first last four showing after he had made £13,000 in the previous two seasons. His form continued into the Gibraltar Open where he won four matches to meet Liang in the quarter-finals and was beaten 4–1. However, Grace could only win two out of nine matches during the rest of the season which included making his debut at the World Grand Prix (lost 4–2 to Mark Allen in the first round). Grace finished a season inside the top 64 in the world rankings for the first time as he was 60th.\n2016/2017 season.\nAt the Paul Hunter Classic, Grace beat Sean O'Sullivan 4–0 and Matthew Stevens 4–3 and then did not drop a frame in eliminating Jack Lisowski and Robbie Williams.&lt;ref name=\"2016/17\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This saw him play in his second career ranking event quarter-final in which he led Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 3–1, but lost 4–3. Grace was beaten 4–1 by Barry Hawkins in the third round of the English Open and lost in the quarter-finals of the Shoot-Out to Shaun Murphy.\nGrace then qualified for his first World Championship by overcoming Thor Chuan Leong 10–6, Mark Joyce 10–6 and Akani Songsermsawad 10–3 and played Kyren Wilson in the first round. Grace only trailed 5–4 at the end of the first session after being 5–1 down and then made a century to be 7–6 behind. However, Wilson then took three successive frames to win 10–6. His end-of-year ranking of 44 is the highest Grace has ever been.\n2017/18 season.\nHe dropped off the tour at the end of the 2017/18 season but entered Q School in an attempt to win back a place. However, his bid to regain professional status ended unsuccessfully, as he lost in all three 2018 Q School events.\nPersonal life.\nGrace also works at the Northern Snooker Centre and sells his own portrait paintings of snooker players to make extra money."

        "text": "James Clancy (born December 18, 1955) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Toronto Blue Jays (1977–88), Houston Astros (1989–91) and Atlanta Braves (1991). He batted and threw right-handed.\nTexas Rangers.\nClancy attended St. Rita of Cascia High School on the south side of Chicago and was drafted by the Texas Rangers in the fourth round of the 1974 MLB Draft. Clancy played rookie level baseball with the Rangers Gulf Coast League team, where he had a record of 3–3 with a 2.72 ERA in nine starts.\nThe Rangers moved Clancy up to the Anderson Rangers of the Western Carolinas League for the 1975 season, however, despite a respectable ERA of 3.83 in 23 starts, Clancy had a poor 6–13 record. Texas moved Clancy up to the San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League in 1976, however, he had a rough season, posting a record of 6–8 with a 6.41 in 23 starts. He was left unprotected in the 1976 MLB Expansion Draft, and was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays with the sixth pick.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nClancy began his Blue Jays career playing with the Cleveland Indians AA affiliate, the Jersey City Indians of the Eastern League. Despite having a poor season with the team, where he had a 5–13 record and 4.88 ERA in 20 starts, the Blue Jays called him up to the Major League level. Clancy made his MLB debut on July 26, 1977, against the Texas Rangers at Exhibition Stadium. Clancy started the game, however, he lasted only two innings, allowing five runs as the Rangers routed Toronto 14–0. Clancy earned his first major league victory in his next start, pitching a complete game, allowing seven hits and one earned run as Toronto defeated the Milwaukee Brewers 3–2. Clancy would finish the year with a 4–9 record with a 5.05 ERA.\nIn 1978, Clancy spent his first full season with the Blue Jays, earning a 10–12 record with a 4.09 ERA in 31 games. He had an injury-plagued season in 1979, where he had a 2–7 record and a 5.51 ERA in 12 games.\nClancy had a solid season in 1980, as he had a 13–16 record with a 3.30 ERA and 15 complete games, before struggling in the 1981 season, as Clancy had a 6–12 record with a 4.90 ERA.\nIn 1982, Clancy posted his first winning season, as he had a 16–14 record, starting a league high 40 games, and appearing in the 1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, where he pitched a perfect fourth inning.\nClancy had another solid season in 1983, compiling a record of 15–11 with a 3.91 ERA, as the Blue Jays had their first ever winning season.\nClancy struggled in 1984, as he had a losing record for the first time in three seasons, with a 13–15 record, and a 4.64 ERA in a league high 36 starts. He led the league in earned runs allowed with 125. The 1985 season would be injury plagued, however, Clancy pitched effectively, earning a 9–6 record and a 3.78 ERA as Toronto made the post-season for the first time in team history. The injured Clancy pitched in only one inning in the 1985 ALCS as Toronto lost to the Kansas City Royals in seven games.\nHe had a disappointing 1986 season, as Clancy posted a 14–14 record with a 3.94 ERA, followed by a strong year in 1987, in which he had a 15–11 record and a 3.54 ERA as the Blue Jays failed to qualify for the playoffs in both years. Clancy spent his final season with Toronto in 1988, where he struggled with a record of 11-13 and a 4.49 ERA, as the Jays once again missed the playoffs.\nHouston Astros.\nClancy became a free agent after the 1988 season, and signed a contract with the Houston Astros. He made his Astros debut on April 8, 1989, pitching 8.1 innings and allowing two runs in a 6–2 win over the San Diego Padres at The Astrodome. He would struggle as the season went along, sporting a record of 7–14 with a 5.08 ERA as the Astros finished in third place in the National League West.\nClancy split time between starting and working out of the bullpen in 1990, where he struggled with a 2–8 record and a 6.51 ERA, and had a stint with the Tucson Toros, the Astros AAA affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. In 1991, Clancy spent the season working out of the bullpen, and despite a 0–3 record, he was effective, as he had a 2.78 ERA in 30 games and earned five saves. On July 31, 1991, Clancy was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Matt Turner.\nAtlanta Braves.\nClancy appeared in 24 games with the Atlanta Braves, all out of the bullpen, as he posted a 3–2 record with a 5.71 ERA, helping Atlanta win the National League West division. In the 1991 NLCS, Clancy made only one appearance, getting the only batter out that he faced as the Braves defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates to earn a spot in the World Series. Clancy pitched in three games during the 1991 World Series, and earned his first ever post-season victory in the third game of the series as Atlanta defeated the Minnesota Twins 5–4 in twelve innings. Clancy finished the series with a 1–0 record with a 4.15 ERA, but the Twins won the series in seven games.\nClancy became a free agent after the season, and signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs, but he retired during spring training in 1992."

        "title": "Peru at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "Peru participated in the World Cup during the first World Cup in 1930 and has participated in qualifiers since 1958.\nPeru were invited to the first FIFA World Cup in Uruguay in 1930. They lost both of their games and finished 10th out of 13 teams. The team either withdrew or did not enter the next four tournaments, in 1934, 1938, 1950, and 1954. Peru participated but did not qualify in 1958, 1962, or 1966.\nPeru had its best result in Mexico 1970, finishing in seventh place. Peru again finished in the top eight at the World Cup in Argentina 1978. They finished first in their group during the first round of the tournament, but were eliminated after losing all their games in the second round. Peru reached the next World Cup finals in Spain 1982, although the team was eliminated in the first round after 2 draws and 1 loss. From 1986 to 2014, Peru did not advance past the CONMEBOL qualifying round.\nAfter finishing fifth in CONMEBOL qualifying, Peru reached the 2018 finals by defeating New Zealand in an intercontinental play-off. Peru did not make it past the group stage in 2018, winning one match and losing two.\nPeru finished fifth again in 2022 qualification and returned to the intercontinental play-off, this time as a one-off match against Australia. However, Peru would lose the match on penalties, 5–4, thus failing to qualify for Group D of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nHistory.\nFinals.\nAs one of the 13 national sides that accepted the invitation to the inaugural World Cup, Peru was placed in Group 3 with Romania and hosts Uruguay. With a mere 300 spectators, Peru's match against Romania holds the record of lowest attendance in a World Cup game. Peru lost (1–3) in a violent game where, in the second half, a fight broke out and a Peruvian became the first player sent off in a World Cup. A few days later, Peru and Uruguay played the inaugural match in the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo. The Peruvians were lauded by the spectators for their defense and the impressive ability of forward José María Lavalle. Peru lost (0-1) to the eventual champions, who defeated their subsequent opponents by scoring at least 4 goals per game.\nThe Peruvian squad next qualified for the Mexico 1970 World Cup, where they were placed in Group 4 with West Germany, Bulgaria, and Morocco. Playing their first game two days after the 1970 Ancash earthquake, the team quickly conceded two goals to Bulgaria. However, as Brian Glanville stated, \"the elusive dribbling of Cubillas, the powerful breaks from the back four of Héctor Chumpitaz, the running of [Hugo] Sotil and [Alberto] Gallardo, turned the tide.\" Peru eventually won 3–2. After defeating Morocco (3–0) and losing to West Germany (1–3), the team finished second in the group and advanced to the quarterfinals. Facing Rivellino, Tostão, Jairzinho and Pelé, Peru was beaten by Brazil (2–4) in \"a spectacular and effervescent game, a game in which both sides delighted in attack and scorned caution,\" and where both teams displayed \"a feast of open play and goals.\"\nIn the Argentina 1978 World Cup, Peru was placed in Group 4 with Scotland, Iran, and the Netherlands. With a midfield identified \"as the best in the world\" by Argentine sports magazine \"El Gráfico\", Peru advanced to the second round as group leaders after defeating Scotland (3–1), drawing with the Netherlands (0–0), and beating Iran (4–1). The second round was divided into two groups, and Peru's results placed it in Group B with Poland, Brazil, and Argentina. After losing to Brazil (0–3) and Poland (0–1), Peru was practically out of contention despite having one more game to play against Argentina. This last match proved controversial because the Peruvians lost by a margin (0–6) that allowed Argentina to reach the final instead of Brazil. Rumors circulated that the match had been fixed, but nothing was ever proven.\nPeru participated in the Spain 1982 World Cup as part of Group 1 with Italy, Poland, and Cameroon. Prior to the competition, Peru embarked on a practice tour that included victories against Hungary (1–2) in Budapest and France (0–1) in Paris, a tie with Algeria (1–1) in Algiers, and, upon returning home, a victory over Romania (2–0). In the World Cup finals, Peru's opening match against Cameroon ended in a scoreless draw. Against Italy, Peru \"put on a mix of solid defending and spectacular attacking\" that resulted in a draw (1–1) against the eventual champions. Peru only needed another draw to advance in the tournament, and it managed to maintain a scoreless first half against Poland, but a \"mixup in the midfield\" and a \"tired defense\" during the second half led to Peru's defeat (1–5) and early elimination.\nPeru would next participate at a World Cup in Russia in 2018, 36 years after their last appearance. On 16 June 2018 they lost 0–1 against Denmark, with a goal scored by Yussuf Poulsen; on 21 June they lost 0–1 against France, with a goal scored by Kylian Mbappé; and on 26 June they defeated Australia 2–0, with goals scored by André Carrillo and Paolo Guerrero. It was the first time Peru had played these three nations at a World Cup, but they were eliminated in the group stage after finishing third with three points.\nQualifiers.\nTeams were invited to participate at the 1930 World Cup, so there was no qualifying tournaments. Peru did not enter or withdrew from the qualifying rounds in 1934, 1938, 1950 and 1954. Peru failed to qualify in 1958, 1962 and 1966.\nFor the 1970 CONMEBOL qualifying tournament, Peru eliminated Bolivia and Argentina. The game between Peru and Bolivia in La Paz is infamous for being fixed by Argentina in favor of Bolivia. Match referee Sergio Chechelev annulled a valid goal from Peru without any justification, allowing Bolivia to win 2–1. Years later, Chechelev admitted that Argentina had paid him to favor Bolivia. Against Argentina in Buenos Aires, the last game of the group, Peru managed a 2–2 draw, preventing Argentina's intervention from succeeding in the end. This is the only time Argentina has failed to advance in World Cup qualifying.\nPeru was eliminated by Chile in 1974. In 1978 and 1982, Peru finished at the top of their group and advanced to the finals. Peru had two wins and two draws in both three-team groups, eliminating Chile and Ecuador in 1978 and Uruguay and Columbia in 1982.\nPeru almost qualified for Mexico 1986. Peru was placed in Group 1 with Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela. Peru's last two matches were against Argentina. Peru beat Argentina 1–0 in Lima on 23 June 1985. In a rematch seven days later in Buenos Aires, Peru led 2–1 but Ricardo Gareca inspired his team to a 2–2 draw sending Argentina into the World Cup finals which they would win. A win would have put Peru directly into the finals, however, they still had a chance to qualify through the CONMEBOL playoff. Peru lost 2–5 aggregate to Chile in the first round.\nPeru was grouped for the 1990 World Cup qualification along with Bolivia and Uruguay. Peru lost all their games with only two goals scored, one by José del Solar and the other by Andres Gonzales. Julio César Uribe was considered one of the best players of the team at that time.\nThe campaign to reach France 1998 was settled only on goal difference, as they finished even on points with Chile. The qualifying system had changed and now all teams were to face each other, and Peru had been able to maintain the 4th spot until the next-to-last match when they faced Chile at Santiago. Peru lost 4–0.\nThe preliminaries for Korea/Japan 2002 were difficult, as the team finished eighth in the group with just four wins in eighteen matches. The fact that they only managed to score 14 goals demonstrated how far the attack had fallen since the days of Cubillas. Particularly low points of the qualifying tournament included a 3–0 loss at Venezuela and defeats in over half of their home matches to Uruguay, Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil.\nDuring the years of 2004 and 2005, Peru participated in the qualifier for the Germany 2006 World Cup. Peru this time hit the ground hard as conflicts with the team's management soon showed poor results in the games that were to follow. Paulo Autuori managed the squad, but was not able to achieve popularity due to a disastrous campaign that led Peru into 8th place just above Bolivia and Venezuela. Freddy Ternero also momentarily managed the squad, but was dismissed due to problems with the FPF.\nThe South Africa 2010 qualifiers, beginning in 2007, resulted in another set of problems for the Peruvian team. In their first four games, the team only achieved two ties, both at home, and two losses. Controversies between the FPF and the IPD (Peruvian Sports Institute) caused problems outside of the field for the national team. Also a scandal shook the team as it was discovered, with informational support of prominent figures such as Jaime Bayly, that several of the players had been partying during the time they were supposedly \"concentrating\" for a match against Brazil. Since then, Claudio Pizarro (SV Werder Bremen), Jefferson Farfán (Schalke 04), Andrés Mendoza (Diyarbakırspor) and Santiago Acasiete (UD Almería), important figures in the team, were never considered again for the national team by coach José del Solar. The 2008 calendar year resulted with three losses, including a 6–0 defeat against Uruguay, two draws against Argentina and Colombia, and only one game won against Venezuela. In 2009 \"la blanquirroj\" couldn't revert the situation, being the first team eliminated, at the 14th round. They only won two matches during this year, against Uruguay and Bolivia.\nFinally, after 36 years, the national team managed to make it to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. They finished fifth in the qualifiers, following a controversial final day draw against Colombia. They went on to face New Zealand in an inter-continental play-off, winning 2–0 on aggregate, courtesy of goals from Farfán and Christian Ramos, to become the last team to qualify for Russia."

        "title": "Rugby and Stamford Railway",
        "text": "The Rugby and Stamford Railway was an early railway in England built in 1850. The London and Birmingham Railway had already built a branch from Blisworth to serve Northampton and extend to Peterborough. The success of this, the Northampton and Peterborough Railway encouraged the directors to look for other ventures. They decided upon a branch from Rugby to Stamford which would link up with other new railways in the east of the country.\nAt approximately the same time the Midland Railway was building its Syston to Peterborough line which opened in 1848. It was therefore necessary to share its line between Luffenham and Stamford.\nAuthorisation.\nThe \"Act to empower the London and Birmingham Railway Company to make a Branch Railway from Rugby to the Syston and Peterborough Railway near Stamford.\", the Rugby and Stamford Railway Act 1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. lxvii). was passed in 1846, a month before the line became part of the London and North Western Railway.\nConstruction.\nLike the earlier branch it was built as a single line which could be doubled at a later date if needed. From Rugby the line followed the valley of the Warwickshire Avon and then the Welland Valley. Although it eased construction with few earthworks it involved a number of river crossings. During the construction the major contractor became bankrupt in 1848. Joseph Firbank, railway contractor, lost much of his savings as a result.\nOpening and expansion.\nThe section from Rugby to Market Harborough, opened in 1850. Originally single track, it was doubled at the end of 1878.\nMarket Harborough to Rockingham opened a month late, but the remainder to Luffenham was not completed until a year later. The line was not doubled throughout until 1878.\nThe increased traffic into Rugby proved a problem, particularly when the Northampton Loop Line opened in 1881. The LNWR therefore applied to build a flyover at the south end of the station and a single track viaduct of some 30 arches which would bring the line in from Clifton Mill. These were completed in 1885.\nAt Market Harborough the Midland Railway arrived in 1857 on its way to Bedford and London. The Midland arranged to share the station but traffic increased to such a degree that a flyover was planned over the LNWR lines north of the station. However instead the two companies build a new joint station which opened in 1884 although not fully completed until February 1886. Passenger traffic was not great, with only a few trains each way on weekdays and two on Sundays.\nIn order to gain a more direct route the LNWR gained permission to build a line from to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway line near Wansford. This opened for freight on 2 July 1879, and passengers on 1 November. Although the line from Seaton to Luffenham was now of little importance, it remained double and Morcott station was built as a double line station. The section was not singled until 1907.\nClosure.\nDespite offering a more direct route between the Midlands and East Anglia, the line was closed on 6 June 1966 as part of the Beeching Axe in favour of the longer Birmingham to Peterborough Line which served larger population centres.\nIn January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments)."

Their home arena is the TalTech Sports Hall.\nTallinn University of Technology teams have won eight Estonian League championships and eight Estonian Cup titles.\nHistory.\nBasketball was first played at Tallinn Tehnikum, the predecessor of the Tallinn University of Technology, on 4 February 1928, when the Tallinn Tehnikum team defeated the visiting University of Tartu 21–19. TPI Spordiklubi (Tallinn Polytechnic Institute Sports Club) was formed in 1948. TPI made their debut in the Estonian Championship in 1951 under coach Jaroslav Dudkin, who would stay with the team for the next 32 seasons. They established themselves as a major force in Estonian basketball in the 1960s, when Tõnno Lepmets and Priit Tomson led the team to six consecutive league titles from 1961 to 1966. August Sokk took over as head coach in 1982 and guided the team, led by his son Tiit Sokk and Margus Metstak, to two more championships in 1984 and 1985. In 1989, TPI changed its name back to TTÜ. The team began to struggle in the early 1990s as more professional basketball clubs joined the top division, and after the 1993–94 season, they withdrew from the league.\nIn 1999, TTÜ became affiliated with Tallinna Ülikoolid-A. Le Coq (formerly BC Tallinn). In 2001, the team moved to the newly renovated TTÜ Sports Hall and changed their name to TTÜ-A. Le Coq. After the 2001–02 season concluded, TTÜ and A. Le Coq shifted their sponsorship to BC Hotronic, who changed their name to TTÜ/A. Le Coq. Coached by Heino Enden and led by veterans Aivar Kuusmaa and Rauno Pehka, the team won the Estonian Cup in 2003.\nOn 6 September 2005, TTÜ announced that they will withdraw from the forthcoming KML season. They returned to the league for the 2006–07 season. In 2010, TTÜ Korvpalliklubi merged operations with Tallinna Kalev and became TTÜ/Kalev. However, the partnership ended after just one season, and TTÜ Korvpalliklubi continued independently.

        "title": "Bradley Braves men's basketball",
        "text": "The Bradley Braves men's basketball team represents Bradley University, located in Peoria, Illinois, in NCAA Division I basketball competition. They compete as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference. The Braves are currently coached by Brian Wardle and play their home games at Carver Arena.\nBradley has appeared in nine NCAA Tournaments, including two Final Fours and national championship games in 1950 and 1954. They last appeared in the NCAA tournament in 2019 (they qualified for the 2020 tournament which was cancelled due to the Covid 19 Pandemic 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament), and last reached the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in 2006. The Braves have also appeared in the National Invitation Tournament 21 times with an all-time NIT record of 26–18 and have won four NIT championships (1957, 1960, 1964, and 1982), second only to St. John's in appearances (30) and titles (5). Until the introduction of the Vegas 16 tournament in 2016, the program was invited to the initial offering of every national postseason tournament.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Braves began playing basketball in 1902, starting out as independent.\nOne of their earliest coaches was Harold Olsen, who in 1959 was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor for his 24 years guiding the Ohio State Buckeyes to multiple Final Fours, spearheading efforts to create the NCAA tournament, helping initiate the 10-second rule and coaching the Chicago Staggs to the finals of the very first BAA (later renamed NBA) playoffs.\nAlfred J. Robertson (1920–1948).\nAlfred J. Robertson was named coach of the Braves football and basketball teams in 1920. Robertson coached both teams until 1948. He is Bradley's all-time winningest coach with 316 wins over 26 seasons. Robertson died in 1948.\nIn 1938, Bradley went 18–2 and was one of six teams invited to the inaugural NIT, where they lost 53–40 to eventual national champion Temple.\nIn 1939, Bradley went 19–3, and received invitations to both the inaugural NCAA Tournament and the second NIT. Bradley turned down the upstart NCAA Tournament and Oregon, which the Braves had defeated, took their bid, and went on to become the inaugural NCAA champion. Bradley lost in the NIT semifinal to Long Island, 36–32.\nAfter a hiatus during World War II, the Braves qualified for the 1947 NIT, losing in the quarterfinals to West Virginia, 69–60.\nForddy Anderson (1948–1954).\nFollowing Robertson's death, the school hired Forrest \"Forddy\" Anderson from Drake. Also in 1948, the school joined the Missouri Valley Conference for the first time.\nNational runner-up and scandal.\nIn 1950, the Braves went 32–5 and won the MVC, earning a bid to the NCAA tournament. The Braves advanced to the National Championship game and lost 71–68 against CCNY, which accomplished perhaps the greatest feat in basketball history, winning the National Invitation and the NCAA tournaments in the same season.\nHowever, in 1951, a point-shaving scandal rocked CCNY specifically, New York, and college basketball as a whole. The scandal affected Bradley as Bradley players Gene Melchiorre, Bill Mann, Bud Grover, Aaron Preece, and Jim Kelly admitted to taking bribes from gamblers to hold down scores against St. Joseph's in Philadelphia in 1951 and against Oregon State in Chicago. Melchiorre, Mann, and George Chianakos pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, but avoided jail time. The others were not charged.\nContinued success.\nIn 1952, the Braves went 32–6 and lost to Syracuse 76–75 in the final of the National Campus Basketball Tournament, which was held in response to the point-shaving scandals centered around New York. After the season, the Braves left the Missouri Valley Conference and became independent again.\nIn 1954, though only going 19–13, the Braves again advanced to the NCAA tournament's championship game, this time falling short to La Salle, 92–76.\nAnderson was hired away from Peoria to coach Michigan State after the season, where he would become the first coach in NCAA history to lead two schools to the Final Four.\nBob Vanatta coached the Braves for two seasons after Anderson departed, and led Bradley to the NCAA tournament Elite Eight in 1955 as an independent, where they lost to Colorado, 93–81. They returned to the MVC in 1955. Vanatta would go on to coach the Memphis Tigers.\nChuck Orsborn (1956–1965).\nNIT championships.\nChuck Orsborn, a Bradley alum and basketball player in the 1930s, took over in 1956 after being an assistant from 1947 to 1956. In 1957, his first year as head coach, the Braves won the NIT championship over Memphis State, the school's first NIT title. The school returned to the NIT in 1958 and to the NIT championship game in 1959, losing to St. John's. In 1960, the Braves won their second NIT championship, defeating Providence in the title game. The Braves were led by Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, 2-time Consensus first-team All-American, future NBA champion and 7 time NBA All Star Chet Walker.\nIn Orsborn's first six seasons, the Braves finished ranked in the top-20 in the final AP Poll, including finishing in the top six each year between 1959 and 1962. However, conference rival Cincinnati was in the midst of a run that ended in five straight Final Four appearances, including two national championships. In the days before at-large bids in the NCAA tournament, Bradley was left outside the tournament field all six seasons and never reached the NCAA tournament in nine seasons under Orsborn.\nHowever, the Braves did win a share of their second MVC crown in 1962, sharing that title with eventual NCAA Champion Cincinnati, but lost in the NIT's first round. A return to the NIT in 1964 resulted in the Braves' third NIT championship in eight years. After another trip to the NIT in 1965, Orsborn took the position of Bradley's director of athletics and served in that function until 1978.\nFrom 1956 to 1965, he compiled a record of 194–56 (.774). During this nine-year span as head coach, the Braves also earned six Associated Press top 20 finishes, Orsborn was named MVC coach of the year in 1960 and 1962. Orsborn also has the distinction of recording his first 100 victories in 120 games, which is sixth on the all-time list for college coaches.\nJoe Stowell (1965–1978).\nThe Braves again turned to a Bradley alum as Joe Stowell, who was an assistant coach under Orsborn, became Bradley's ninth head coach in 1965. In his 13 years as head coach, the Braves made only two postseason appearances: the 1968 NIT and the 1974 National Commissioners Invitational tournament. He was fired as head coach in 1978. Stowell finished with 197 wins, the second most in Brave history.\nDick Versace (1978–1986).\nBradley hired Dick Versace from Jackson Community College in 1978. As an assistant at Michigan State University, Versace was heavily involved in the recruitment of Magic Johnson. Versace led Bradley to the MVC regular season and tournament championships in 1980, losing to Texas A&amp;M in the NCAA tournament, 55–53. He won the regular season MVC championship again in 1982, but was snubbed by the NCAA selection committee, and the team won the NIT championship, defeating Purdue 67–58 at Madison Square Garden.\nIn the 1985–86 season, he was named National College Coach of the Year by the U.S. Basketball Writers' Association as the Braves went 32–3 and were ranked as high as #7 in the nation during the season, capturing the MVC title before falling to eventual national champion Louisville in the NCAA tournament second round. His back court players included future NBA All Star Hersey Hawkins and future NBAer and Bradley Head Coach Jim Les. After this season, Versace left for the NBA where he became head coach of the Indiana Pacers and eventually President and General Manager of the Memphis Grizzlies.\nStan Albeck (1986–1991).\nBradley alumnus and former Chicago Bulls head coach Stan Albeck was hired to lead the Braves in 1986. In 1988, Albeck led the Braves to the MVC regular season and tournament titles behind National Player of the Year and national scoring leader Hersey Hawkins, and finished #11 in the final Associated Press Poll before losing to Auburn in the NCAA tournament, 90–86. After leaving Bradley in 1991, Albeck became an assistant for the New Jersey Nets, Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors of the NBA.\nJim Molinari (1991–2002).\nBradley turned to Northern Illinois University head coach Jim Molinari to lead the Braves in 1991. After NIT appearances in 1994 and 1995 the Braves, led by future NBA first round draft pick Anthony Parker, captured the MVC championship in 1996 and advanced to the NCAA tournament where they were defeated by Stanford, 66–58. Molinari led the Braves to NIT appearances again in 1997, 1999 and 2001.\nJim Les (2002–2011).\nBradley turned to another alum, Jim Les, to take over for Molinari. Les was a senior on the 1986 Braves squad that went 32–3 before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. However, the Braves failed to finish above .500 in Les's first three years as head coach.\nIn 2006, the Braves won their final five games of the season to finish in a tie for fifth place in MVC play. The Braves surprised in the MVC tournament, reaching the championship game before losing to Southern Illinois. The Braves received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 13 seed, their first trip to the Tournament since 1996. In the Tournament, the Braves upset No. 4-ranked Kansas in the first round and upset No. 5-ranked Pittsburgh to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 1955. In the Sweet Sixteen, the No. 1-seeded Memphis defeated the Braves. O'Bryant left Bradley after the season for the NBA draft, where he was drafted 9th overall.\nEach of Les's next three Brave teams appeared in postseason play, losing in the second round of the 2007 NIT, and finishing as runners-up in the 2008 College Basketball Invitational and 2009 CollegeInsider.com Tournament.\nAfter a disappointing 2010 and a 20-loss 2011, the Braves fired Les.\nGeno Ford (2011–2015).\nKent State head coach Geno Ford was hired to replace Les. Ford's teams struggled under his leadership, failing to win more than seven games in conference play and finishing in last place in his first and final years at Bradley. The Braves did receive an invite to the College Basketball Invitational in 2013, where they advanced to the quarterfinals. In his final year, the Braves finished 9–24, 3–15 in MVC play. After the season, Ford was fired. He finished with a four-year record of 46–86 at Bradley.\nFord's tenure at Bradley was most notable for a lawsuit filed by Kent State, his former employer, seeking payment on a buyout clause in his contract. Ford was found liable for $1.2 million. Kent State continued actions against Bradley for \"tortious interference with Kent State’s contractual relationship\" with Ford, but Kent State dropped the case in 2013.\nBrian Wardle (2015–present).\nFollowing Geno Ford's firing, the school hired Green Bay head coach Brian Wardle. In Wardle's first year, the Braves continued their struggles, finishing the season 5–24 and in last place in the MVC. Wardle would have over 10 freshmen and only Donte Thomas was an active player who stayed from the Geno Ford era. In 2017, with Junior Donte Thomas as their best player, the 2017 Braves team improved to a 13–20 record and finished in a tie for sixth place in MVC play. In 2018 the Braves finished 20–13 while going 9–9 in the conference. They defeated Drake in the first round of the MVC tournament. Bradley then played #1 seeded Loyola-Chicago, the eventual standout Final Four team. Bradley failed to score down the stretch and lost a close game.\nIn 2019 Wardle led the Braves to the Cancun Challenge championship over Penn State. After this the Braves slumped and went 0–5 in conference play. The Braves regrouped and finished 5th in MVC play at 9–9. They beat Missouri State and upset Loyola-Chicago. Bradley looked to capture their first MVC tournament title since 1988. They played UNI, the 6 seed, and were down by 18 points in the second half. Bradley rallied and cut the deficit to 6 with a 12–0 point run. The Braves went on to win the game. They entered March Madness for the first time since 2006 but lost to Michigan State 76–65 in the opening round. It was Coach Wardle's first NCAA tournament appearance with the Braves.\nWardle led the Braves to another improved season in 2019–20. Bradley finished with an overall record of 23–11 and 11–7 in Missouri Valley Conference play. Bradley won the MVC tournament title for the second year in a row. Due to COVID-19, the NCAA tournament was cancelled leaving the Braves without a postseason appearance.\nPostseason appearances.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Braves have appeared in nine NCAA Tournaments and have advanced to two final fours and two national championship games. Their combined record is 11–9. They qualified for the 2020 NCAA Tournament, which was subsequently cancelled.\nNIT results.\nThe Braves have appeared in 22 National Invitation Tournaments and are four-time champions (1957, 1960, 1964, and 1982).

Fans were given the opportunity to select the greatest players from each of seven specific timelines, resulting in a total of 60 players. Throughout the 2002–03 season, those 60 players were honored at selected games. Fans were given the opportunity to help select the 15 greatest players in the program's history, creating the team of the century. The team was honored during a ceremony at the Peoria Civic Center on November 21, 2003. In addition to the “Team of the Century,” Braves fans also selected a “Game of the Century” by voting games through a 16-entry, tournament format.

        "title": "Tennis Club de Paris",
        "text": "Tennis Club de Paris (Tennis Club of Paris), also known as the TCP, is a tennis club founded in 1895 in Paris.\nHistory.\n1895 to 1930.\nIn 1895, a few sportsmen, including Armand Masson and Paul Lecaron, had the idea of creating a tennis club that would bring together covered parquet courts and open clay courts.\nThese first founding members of the TCP, who were also patrons, financed the rental of a piece of land located at the corner of rue de Civry (at no. 2) and boulevard Exelmans and extending as far as boulevard Murat, halfway between Porte d'Auteuil and Porte de Saint Cloud, by means of shares at a nominal rate of 5,000 francs. They had just formed the Société Anonyme Immobilière du Tennis Club de Paris. In association with the owner of the land, they also financed the construction of 4 covered parquet courts and 5 open clay courts. In compensation for their financing, the first founding members were admitted as lif\ne members of the TCP. But legal disputes ensued as the club's financial balance was precarious.\nThe TCP was the cradle of French tennis. Before the First World War, the champions of the time: Aymé, Vacherot, Gobert, Decugis, played at the TCP. Then we saw: Canet, Decugis, Germot, Gobert, Laurents. The four famous musketeers: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, René Lacoste. And in contemporary times, many French first series players.\nIn 1923, the TCP adopted the law of 1901 and became the Association Sportive du Tennis Club de Paris, tenant of the SA Immobilière du TCP. Albert Canet was the first President of the TCP as an Association under the 1901 law. He later became President of the French Lawn Tennis Federation.\n1930 to 1945.\nIn 1930, on the death of his friend Albert Canet, Jean Borotra took over the presidency of the TCP, which then had about 1000 members. The lease on the rue de Civry had not been renewed. It was then that from 1934 onwards, Jean Borotra, helped by Georges Glasser, Gabriel Guy, Pierre Candeliez, efficient members of the Committee and Robert Foulon, Secretary of the French Lawn Tennis Federation, undertook to convince the Government, the City of Paris and the Sports Federations of the need to build, with the collaboration of the TCP, a large multisports stadium such as did not exist in Europe. This operation, carried out with the collaboration of the State, the City of Paris, the TCP itself, and the 1937 Exhibition, could be realised and in 1938 the TCP moved into new premises.\nIt was therefore necessary to appeal to new founding members to finance the complete fitting out of the new TCP. The payment was 15,000 francs and each founding member was entitled to all the benefits of the club for 20 years, i.e. until 1958 (at that time, the active membership fee was 1,500 francs per year with the benefits that still exist today: balls, lights, hut, towels). Thanks to this technical and financial effort, the TCP signed a 50-year lease with the City of Paris in 1937. These facilities, in great demand in the capital, were fully used by all the sports federations in covered halls. The complex included: The part that took the name of \"Stade Pierre-de-Coubertin\" and which was administered by the city with: A large covered stadium with 4000 seats and another small stadium with about 800 seats; a second small stadium was to be built later. The part rented to the TCP with a large hall with 6 covered wooden courts, a fitness room and, of course, all the lounges, restaurants, luxuriously furnished changing rooms and ancillary facilities necessary for the life of a large club. The TCP itself had built 8 clay courts (six of which were unfortunately separated by the Avenue Georges Lafont). The operation proved to be perfectly balanced in 1938 and 1939 and the greatest winter sports events were played there: the French International Championships, the Paris-London Meeting, etc. and the King Gustav V of Sweden Cup, created by Jean Borotra and the TCP for this occasion.\nFrom September 1939 to May 1940, the TCP lived a \"slow\" life under the attentive leadership of Robert Foulon. During the very long years of occupation, the TCP gradually resumed a certain activity, albeit moderate, until September 15, 1943, the date of the last bombing of Paris, when an American squadron, charged with crushing Renault's \"O\" factory located on the Ile Seguin, used for the assembly of German tanks, succeeded perfectly, but without being able to avoid splattering the \"Stade de Coubertin – TCP\" complex, which was completely crushed by 12 bombs of 500 kilos. In 30 seconds, the life of the club was stopped.\n1945 to 1965.\nAt the end of the war, Pierre Candeliez, President of the TCP, with the help of his Committee and the vigorous support of the French Lawn Tennis Federation, did everything possible to obtain the reconstruction of this sports complex from the City of Paris.\nThe combined and sustained efforts of the competent departments of the city (compensation for war damage, etc.), the Federation and the TCP finally obtained satisfaction despite enormous difficulties of all kinds, and gradually, first the open courts, then the covered courts, and finally the large stadium, were returned to their original form.\nOn the other hand, the construction of the ancillary facilities was significantly delayed; the difficulties associated with this period did not allow it to be carried out again with the same splendour as in 1937, but it nevertheless met the expectations of the members. Naturally, the TCP alone had to face the task of repairing its installations and interior fittings.\nIn order to collect the necessary funds, Jean Borotra, with all his titles and 6 Davis Cup victories under his belt, organised and carried out major trips around the world in 1947: the United States, Black Africa and Asia. This initiative was very well received everywhere and renowned players immediately collaborated with enthusiasm and dedication. Among them, we should mention Robert Abdesselam, Marcel Bernard, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, Bernard Destremau, and his teammates Roger Dubuc and Gil de Kermadec.\nThe return of the Tennis Club de Paris with the provision of the new covered courts coincided by a happy coincidence, in 1950, with its victory in the French men's team championship. (Jean Borotra, Jacques Carot, Roland Delarue, Roger Dubuc, Georges Glasser, Gil de Kermadec, Bernard Lucot). During the winter, the club's facilities were used for important tournaments such as the Tournoi de la Toussaint, the Coupe Canet or the French International Championships on covered courts. We could see the greatest players of that time playing on our courts as well as on the Coubertin central court: Patty, Drobny, Larsen, Ulrich... This era is now over. The facilities of the Coubertin Stadium are no longer large enough to ensure sufficient revenue for professional players in search of dollars. Pierre Candeliez died prematurely in 1951, and Georges Glasser took over the presidency until 1965.\nfrom 1965 to the present day.\nThe TCP men's first team won the French team championship in 1987, more than 37 years after their first title. For the men's team, this was their second and last title, as the following year, it was the club's girls who won their first title in the women's championship. This title was held until 1990, when it was relinquished to the Basque Coast club. It was not until 13 years later that a TC Paris team reached the final of the championship and lost 6–2 to TC Thionville in Toulouse.\nThe men's team lost the 2012 championship final 4–0 to Villa Primrose, a Bordeaux club that had been waiting for a title for over a hundred years. After a surprise defeat by the small club TC Quimperlé in the final the following year, the Parisian club was crowned French Champion in 2014 for its third consecutive final against TC Lille, winning 4–2 in the final after having swept Sarcelles in the semi-final, despite being the arch-favourite this year.\nTCP sports facilities.\nTennis, winter configuration :\nTennis, Summer configuration :\nOutdoor swimming pool\nSports hall"

        "text": "The United Kingdom eSports Association or UKeSA (pronounced \"You-Kes-Sah\") attempted to be a governing body of eSports in the United Kingdom and a member of the International eSports Federation (IeSF). The headquarters were in London, United Kingdom.\nThe UKeSA was responsible for governing amateur and professional eSports, building a structure with the government, industry and community in mind. These include Metropolitan Police Service, BBC, Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association, Procter &amp; Gamble, Future Publishing, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, The New World Assembly, XLEAGUE.TV, Team Dignitas, Reason Gaming, Team Infused, Fnatic, QuadV and Cadred. The association was launched on 31 October 2008 during the London Games Festival and was chaired by former XLEAGUE.TV channel head Ray Mia. He explained that UKeSA will essentially be the eSports equivalent of The Football Association, offering a centralised infrastructure to UK eSports as well as support towards semi-professional and professional team and UK community led projects with the government.\nUKeSA set up leagues and cup tournaments, split between three divisions: Open Division, Championship Division and Premiership Division. Each division represents the different levels of competition from amateur to professional and is played online via the internet through the means of a personal computer or a video games console. Teams can compete in a series of video games including \"FIFA 09\", \"Call of Duty 4\" and \"Counter-Strike\". Competition finals of these divisions were hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom. Teams are gathered to play against each other in off-line, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.\nHistory.\n31 October 2008 sees the official launch of the United Kingdom eSports Association during the 2008 London Games Festival in London.

London\" exhibition at the Olympia Exhibition Centre, London, which takes place in June 2009.\nThe governing body signs up to become a member of the International eSports Federation.\nIn December 2009, amid controversy, the UKeSA signed for bankruptcy and has since made no attempt to pay back any individual or organisation it owed.\nCommittee Structure.\nThe UKeSA structure is made up of three key committees and a players union. Each committee plays a vital role in the operations of the eSports Association. So far, only the Executive Committee and the Community Council has been officially announced.\nThe Executive Committees purpose is to assist, direct and act as ambassadors for UK eSports to the wider public. The Committee shall be composed of prominent industry, media and government figures and shall include senior representatives from the games industry.\nThe Community Council consists of six people: Three elected members of the UK eSports community, two permanent Executive Committee members of the UKeSA and one Senior Operational Manager. Originally, the three elected members of the eSports community had to be Team Managers from Championship or Premiership Teams. This was changed to make the Community Council both representative and inclusive of the UK eSports community. However, candidates must be UK passport holders and they must reside in the United Kingdom.\nCandidates put themselves up for electoral status and are given an opportunity to state their wishes as to why they should be chosen for the Community Council. Questions are then submitted to the candidates by the public and are then answered by writing or through a live debate broadcast on Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) or web-streaming.\nVoting for potential Community Council members are done via public vote and are tallied via electronic means, such as a website. Voters are allowed to vote for 3 candidates and can only choose once per election. Elected members are not able to sit in the Community Council for two consecutive terms, however, they are able to be re-elected after standing down from a single term. No length of time has been given as to indicate how long these terms are.\nElected members of the committee are responsible for community related operational and disciplinary matters. These include the enforcement of game, tournament and cup regulations and rules, disciplinary breaches of regulations and conduct, allocation of the seasonal cash retainers, game type and rule suggestions and responsibility for video game specific sub-committees. Attendance is required for Community Committee members through bi-monthly conference calls and physical meetings by attending the General Assembly.\nOn 18 March 2009, UKeSA have announced the results of the elections for the Community Council. The following will be sitting in as members of the Community Council for one term:\nAlso on the board for the Community Council is Ray Mia, who sits in as the permanent Executive Committee members of the Council and Peter Simpson as the Senior Operational Manager.\nThe Ethics Commission is charged with defining and updating a framework of ethical principles, including a Code of Ethics &amp; Conduct, based upon the values and principles enshrined in the UKeSA Charter.\nThe Players Association is a separate entity that is supported by the UKeSA. This body, once established will be permanently represented on the Ethics Commission.\nGeneral Assembly.\nMeetings are set up between the Executive Committee, Community Council, Ethics Commission, Players Association and other leading figures among the government, the eSports community (such as the International eSports Federation) and video games industry. Held three times a year, these meetings consist of debated issues concerning eSports in the United Kingdom, how they relate to operational aspects of UKeSA and the endorsement of the UKeSA Charter. The General Assembly is invitational only, with permanent membership endorsed by elective procedures.\nCompetition structure.\nCompetitions are split into three divisions, some of which will comprise a league and a cup tournament. Each of the divisions represent the different levels, citing grassroots amateur level to the professional level. There are three seasons per year, which last approximately three months per season. Teams from each division can face promotions and relegation depending on how they perform in each of the leagues during the season. Throughout each of the seasons, a trophy cup tournament is held between teams of the Open and Championship Division. Competition finals of the Cup Tournament, Championship and Premiership divisions are hosted at a specially selected venue in the United Kingdom each season. Qualifying eSports teams are gathered to play against each other in offline, local area network (LAN) setups as opposed to online play in the initial stages of the tournament.\nThe Open Division represents the grassroots of eSports and form part of the amateur competitions. Playing restrictions are set to a minimum standard and games are played for fun or for practise. Because the Open Division is viewed as the amateur level of eSports, many teams that participate are generally those who have just started or want to determine whether they are suitable at competitive level before moving to the semi-professional side of eSports.\nThe Championship Division represents the semi-professional competition level. Teams that choose to play in this division are generally groups who wish to move to the next stage of eSports and play for financial gain. Many of these team are established and may have squads for each individual game/title. Teams can be promoted from this division into the Premiership Division, through participation. Support and training are given to teams to aid their development. Such training includes both management and business elements, which is seen as crucial to building a team into global brand.\nThe Premiership Division represents the professional level. Teams are given retainers to support themselves and develop their internal infrastructure as well as business support and training. Teams can be demoted through participation of competitions and must follow guidelines and rules throughout their participation.\nA seasonal Cup Tournament is held between the teams of the Open Division and the Championship Division. Teams are required to pay to enter and games are then carried out online. The final remaining teams will face at an offline, local area network (LAN) event. Premiership Division teams are not allowed to enter.\nTeams.\nCurrently, there are 13 selected eSports teams that represent the professional level of eSports. These teams participate in the UKeSA Premiership Division and play in different leagues that represent the video games they compete in. These teams are given media coverage through website editorials, terrestrial, satellite and cable television, internet protocol television and podcast. Business, management and financial support are given throughout the season, offering training managerial skills and business development, which will prepare the teams for sponsorships from companies like Dell, Adidas and other major business companies. Retainers are paid to Premiership teams at the end of each season, which will give financial support they need to carry on pushing the team brand as a primary business.\nThe number of Championship Division teams are determined by several factors such as paid entry fees and completion of team data like video game user identification tags, with teams submitting themselves for the competition each season. These teams are working towards being promoted into the UKeSA Premiership Division, which will offer the team the support they need to get their brand off the ground. Teams in the UKeSA Championship Division are given limited support for business and management training, while financial support comes from winning the competition.\nCompetitive Video Games.\nThere are a total of 17 video game titles currently used throughout the different divisions. They consist from a range of first person shooters, driving simulation, beat 'em ups, real-time strategy, sports simulation and rhythm action genres. Each of the video game titles have some element of competitive online and offline multiplayer modes, which allow the players to play against each other, specifically using competitive gaming rules set by UKeSA.\nNew video games titles are added when the eSports community requests for the inclusion in the competition. Titles are first placed into the Open Division to gauge the amount of sign-ups for that specific video game. If enough players register in the Open Division, UKeSA will move to include it into the semi-professional, Championship Division, where eSports athletes will be able to register to play for the prize fund. If a particular video game title is popular enough in the Championship Division, UKeSA will warrant that video game a place in the Premiership Division.\nNot all video game titles are suitable for use in a competitive environment as certain video game titles do not allow private sessions hosted by the players via peer-to-peer or server-led gaming rooms. Such games include UbiSoft's EndWar, where online play is restricted to its open Theatre of War lobby system.\nMembership To The International eSport Federation.\nThe association was one of the members of the International eSport Federation (IeSF) alongside the following eSports associations:\nJapan, Bulgaria and China were also looking to join the federation at the GStar 2008 exhibition held in South Korea.\nFuture developments.\nUKeSA filed for bankruptcy whilst owing a large number of teams, players and industry related companies significant sums of money (http://www.cadred.org/News/Article/88207/)\nMisconception.\nUKeSA are not to be confused by the Electronic Sports Ltd's eSports competitions organized by Richard Millington and Morgan Olsson under the same name from 2002 to 2005."

        "title": "World Series ring",
        "text": "A World Series ring is an award given to Major League Baseball players who win the World Series. Since only one Commissioner's Trophy is awarded to the team, a World Series ring is an individual award that players and staff of each World Series champion team get to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. World Series rings are uniquely commissioned by the winning team each year and presented to deserving players and staff early in the next season. The rings have been made by companies that include Jostens, Tiffany &amp; Co., Dieges &amp; Clust, and L.G. Balfour Company.\nThe first World Series rings were given to members of the New York Giants after winning the 1922 World Series. By the mid-1920s, each winning team gave their players a ring. Though the ring started off simple, usually containing only one diamond, rings over time have become more elaborate and ornate, with the 2003 World Series ring containing over 200 diamonds. In addition to their inherent value, World Series rings also carry additional value as sports memorabilia. A World Series ring belonging to Casey Stengel sold for $180,000. Lenny Dykstra's 1986 World Series ring sold for over $56,000 during his bankruptcy proceedings. Other rings sold in auctions have sold for over $10,000 apiece. Replica rings given to fans have sold for as much as $1\nHistory.\nPrior to the 1922 World Series, players on the World Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch fob. The first World Series ring was given to the members of the New York Giants following their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New York Yankees. When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were given a commemorative pocket watch. Rings became an annual tradition beginning in 1926 when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Yankees in the World Series. In past years, players often requested other items in place of rings, including cufflinks and tie clips. Frankie Crosetti and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series championships. Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 World Series ring.\nMembers of the 1973 World Series champion Oakland Athletics were upset when team owner Charlie O. Finley, following salary disputes with his players, presented his team with rings that were identical to the ones received after winning the 1972 World Series, except without the one-carat diamond. Reggie Jackson referred to them as \"trash rings\". The first ring to contain more than one diamond was the 1977 World Series ring commissioned by the Yankees, which had over a dozen diamonds. Over time, ring designs have become larger and more elaborate, with Yogi Berra saying in 2009, \"They're so much bigger now, they're like weapons. You can't even wear them.\" Whereas older rings were 10 carat and between 20 and 25 pennyweight, modern rings are typically 14 carat and 50 pennyweight. The rings commissioned by the Florida Marlins after the 2003 World Series are believed to be among the most expensive World Series rings ever made; made of 14-carat white gold, the ring featured 229 diamonds, including one teal diamond, and 13 rubies. The rings cost $20,000 apiece due to the quantity of the purchase, though they retailed at $40,000 each. After breaking their long championship drought in 2016, the Chicago Cubs commissioned rings said to be worth up to $70,000, consisting of 214 diamonds at carats, three carats of rubies, and carats of sapphires.\nTeams have also increasingly added distinctive touches to make their rings unique from previous versions. For their 2007 World Series rings, the Boston Red Sox commissioned a special version for players who were on both the 2004 and 2007 championship teams, and for 2013, they included the Boston Strong logo on the side. The St. Louis Cardinals had the Rally Squirrel engraved into their 2011 World Series championship rings. For their 2014 World Series rings, the San Francisco Giants included three diamonds on the top bezel and five on the bottom, representing their three titles in five years, and eight championships overall. The 2016 World Series rings for the Chicago Cubs each contain 108 diamonds around the bezel, one for each year that the team went without a championship, and also include an image of a goat on the inner band. For their 2019 World Series ring, the Washington Nationals added an image of Baby Shark on the inside of the band of their ring, which was the walk-up song of outfielder Gerardo Parra and became an anthem for the team and their fans. Companies that have been commissioned to create World Series rings include Jostens, Tiffany &amp; Co., Dieges &amp; Clust, and the L.G. Balfour Company.\nDistribution.\nPlayers typically receive their rings in pregame ceremonies early in the next season. Since the rings are commissioned by the team, many non-players affiliated with the team, including front office executives, coaches, scouts, broadcasters, locker room staff, and groundskeepers also receive rings at the team's discretion. After the 2004 World Series, the Red Sox ordered over 500 rings; the Cardinals commissioned 400 rings in 2006; and the Kansas City Royals distributed about 700 rings after their 2015 title. Players who were only briefly on the team's roster during a championship season and those no longer affiliated with the winning team also often receive rings. Arthur Rhodes, Bengie Molina, and Lonnie Smith played in the World Series against a team they played for earlier in the season, guaranteeing them World Series rings regardless of the series outcome. As both the physical size and number of rings given out has increased, teams have started producing both \"A\" and \"B\" versions, and sometimes \"C\" versions, that are similar in appearance but smaller in size and use cheaper materials. The most expensive \"A\" rings are typically reserved for full-time players, coaches, and executives, while bit players and other team employees receive the cheaper \"B\" and \"C\" rings.\nRings as trophies.\nIn modern years, the importance of World Series rings to players has increased, whereas decades ago during the reserve clause era, players typically emphasized more the bonus World or League Championship check rather than the ring. Alex Rodriguez said his 2009 World Series ring \"means the world\" to him, and that he would wear it daily. Sergio Romo of the 2010 World Series champion San Francisco Giants said of his ring: \"In all reality, this is why we play right here.\" Jon Jay said his 2011 World Series ring \"...represents last year and all the hard work. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of something like this.\" Former player and current Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper said, \"It's not a hug. It's not a handshake. It's not a pat on the back. It's a ring. It's the one thing every professional athlete wants: something they can hold onto, something they can show off.\" Players' names and uniform numbers are often individually inscribed in their ring. Many players prefer to display their rings as trophies as opposed to wearing them.\nMemorabilia.\nWorld Series rings are considered valuable sports memorabilia. In 2007, Casey Stengel's 1951 World Series ring sold for $180,000. When Lenny Dykstra went through bankruptcy in 2009, his 1986 World Series ring sold for $56,762.50 through Heritage Auctions, three times as much as was expected. Others have sold their rings on eBay. Doug Baker of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers had a new ring made after his original was stolen, and when he recovered the original ring, he sold it for $12,322. Cucho Rodriguez, a scout for the Red Sox, sold his 2004 World Series ring for over $53,000 and in 2011, Scott Williamson auctioned off his 2004 ring for $89,000. More recently, Willie Stargell's 1979 World Series ring was sold at auction for over $82,000. However, the ring that once belonged to disgraced pitcher Brandon Puffer, when offered for sale on the August 15, 2013, episode of \"Pawn Stars\" could not be sold. The shop declined to make an offer, claiming Puffer's off-field problems destroyed the resale value of the ring.\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum contains an exhibit on World Series rings. The New York Yankees Museum, located in Yankee Stadium, has an exhibit with replicas of all Yankees' World Series rings, including the pocket watch given after the 1923 World Series. Yogi Berra won the most World Series rings with 10, as a player. Frankie Crosetti won 17 as a player and as a coach.\nThe most valuable rings can sell for a million dollars or more, most notably the rings belonging to the 1927 Yankees starting lineup. Babe Ruth's ring, after being in the possession of Charlie Sheen for 20 years, sold at auction for over two million dollars in 2017. Its whereabouts are currently unknown as the buyer is unknown."

        "text": "Gordon Jones (born July 25, 1957) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for five seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Los Angeles Rams. He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers.\nCollege career.\nJones was recruited out of East Allegheny high school to play for Johnny Majors and the University of Pittsburgh. The Pitt Panthers of the late 1970's were one of the top programs in the country and some of those players, besides Jones, that would go one to NFL careers include Tony Dorsett, and Matt Cavanaugh. In 1975, Jones played in 12 games, he caught 22 passes for 384 yards and four touchdown passes. That season, Pittsburgh finished ranked 15th in the national and defeated Kansas in the Sun Bowl. 1976 proved to be an odd year stats wise for Jones. He caught one less pass, but for one more yard and one more touchdown than he'd had the previous season.\n1977 was a break out year for Jones. He finished 5th in the national with 45 receptions. His nine touchdown receptions also put him in the top ten in the nation, as he finished seventh. He also had four kick off returns for a touchdown, which put him at number one. He also played in the Gator Bowl, as Pittsburgh crushed Clemson 34-3. In Jones' senior year, he again caught 45 passes, this time for 666 yards and just three touchdown receptions.\nPro career.\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Jones in the second round on the 1979 NFL draft (34th player selected overall). Much of Jones' rookie season was spent on the bench, as he was buried on the depth chart by Morris Owens, Larry Mucker and Isaac Hagins, the team's seasons vets. Jones only started one game, and finished the season with four receptions for 80- yards and one touchdown. He played in the NFC Championship against the Los Angeles Rams, but did not catch a pass. The next season Tampa Bay overhauled their receiving core. Owens was let go, and rookie Kevin House took his place on the roster. Jones started in 14 games, caught 48 passes for 668 yards and five touchdowns, in what be his best season as a pro. With Kevin House emerging as the go to receiver for Tampa Bay, Jones settled into the role as the number two receiver. He started few games over the next two seasons, as Gerald Carter (acquired from the Jets) and Theo Bell, acquired from the Pittsburgh Steelers reduced Jones' workload. After the 1982 season, was finished, Jones moved on from Tampa Bay to play for the Rams. Jones caught 11 passes for 172 yards for the Rams, but the offense was centered around running back Eric Dickerson.\nPost NFL career.\nAs of 2011, Gordon Jones had returned to the city of Tampa and worked as a Respiratory Therapist."

        "title": "Peru at the Copa América",
        "text": "This is a record of Peru's results at the Copa América. Ever since their first Copa América, Peru has had good showings. It is often remembered by fans that Peru was the fourth team (after Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil) to win the South American cup. Even though in 1939 Peru played against only 5 of the South American nations (with no participation from Argentina or Brazil), in 1975 Peru won the cup once more (this time with all the CONMEBOL teams participating).\nRecently, Peru has only been able to get only as far as the runners-up of the tournament which holds its own prestige as being the oldest tournament of international football; along with having Argentina and Brazil (the 2 teams usually considered among the top 5 in the football world), which have also recently been dominating the tournament.\nRecord by opponent.\nPeru's highest margin of victory at a Copa América is four goals, which they have managed a number of times: They won 4–0 against Ecuador in 1941 and 1949 and Colombia in 1949, and 5–1 against Colombia in 1947 and Venezuela in 1991. Peru's biggest defeat was a 0–7 loss against Brazil in the 1997 semi-final.\nPeru 1927.\nAt this point Peru is the 7th nation to join the competition, and in 1927 the games are decided to be played there. Although only 3 teams came to the tournament, Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia; the participating federations decided that the 1st and 2nd places of the competition would represent South America for the Olympic Games to be played at Amsterdam in 1928. The other federations (Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay) did not participate because of economic and sport problems. Peru gained third place after only beating Bolivia.\nPeru 1935.\nThis tournament is characterized by the Argentine and Uruguayan conflict that rooted from the 1930 World Cup. The winners here were going to once more represent South America for the Olympic Games, this time to be played at Berlin. Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay had withdrawn from the tournament. Peru's first game resulted at a 1–0 loss, with a goal scored by a Uruguayan player at the 80th minute. The second one was not much better, and Peru lost 4–1 against Argentina. The last game was won by Peru 1–0 against Chile. The tournament gave Peru the third spot, and helped it train and improve for the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nPeru 1939.\nThis was the first international title the team won. During this time, the team had greatly improved since the World Cup and was re-assuring that dominance they had shown over Austria in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Peru won all 4 games which were against Ecuador (5–2), Chile (3–1), Paraguay (3–0), and Uruguay (2–1) in the final. It's worth the mention that in this tournament Argentina and Brazil did not participate, but that does not take down the merit of Peru's notable act. Peruvian Teodoro Fernández also was the top goal-scorer of the tournament. As an anecdote, Peru was the fourth South American team that raised the trophy (The first three being Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil).\nBrazil 1949.\nBy this time, Peruvian football was recognized by good game and playful management of the ball. Several interesting players came to the national team, but the team faced several problems with the directors and the players themselves. Peru won all but two games. As such, the national team got third place. Paraguay and Brazil, the only ones who beat Peru, had to later play a last tie-breaker match.\nSquad.\nHead Coach: Arturo Fernández\nPeru 1953.\nAs much as Peru did, the team was not capable to achieve another Copa América title until later years. Yet, the games played in 1953 are memorable to Peruvian football history because it was the first time Peru was able to beat Brazil (A certain something not many have been able to achieve). The goal was scored by Navarrete.\n1975 Copa América.\nThis tournament had no fixed venue. For the first phase, Peru was grouped with Chile and Bolivia. After winning both games, which were played both at home and away, Peru qualified for the semifinals along with Colombia, Brazil, and Uruguay (Which were the defending champions). Perhaps unlucky for Peru, they had to face Brazil for their semifinal. At the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil, Peru beat the Verdeamarela by a margin of 3 to 1 with two goals from Enrique Cassareto and one by Teófilo Cubillas. The game played back home at Lima was won by Brazil 2–0. Due to the goal difference, the winner (Which turned out being Peru) was chosen by sorting.\nThe final match was played against Colombia, who had beaten Uruguay. The game played at Bogotá was won by the Colombians 1 to 0. The game played at Lima was won by the Peruvians 2 to 0. Even though this meant Peru should win by the goal difference, a last game was played at the city of Caracas. With a goal at the 25th minute of the game by Hugo Sotil, Peru obtained its second international title.\nSquad.\nHead Coach: Marcos Calderón\n1979 Copa América.\nSquad.\nCoach: José Chiarella\nEcuador 1993.\nPeru had an acceptable participacion in this Copa América when they passed as the leaders of their group with 4 points, 1 more point than Brazil. Paraguay and Chile also were part of this group. Peru tied with Brazil 0–0, tied with Paraguay 1–1 and beat Chile 1–0. The lead scorer for Peru in this competition was José del Solar with three goals. In quarterfinals Peru was eliminated by Mexico 4–2.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Vladimir Popović\nBolivia 1997.\nThe team was able to reach the quarterfinals of this cup and eliminated Argentina (2:1) to advanced into the semifinals. In the semifinals, Peru faced Brazil, and lost by a margin of 7 to 0 (Peru's worst result to date). For the third place spot, Peru faced Mexico. The game was won by Mexico by a goal scored at the 82nd minute of the game.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Freddy Ternero \nPeru 2004.\nThe 2004 Copa América, which they hosted, saw the team lose in the quarter-finals against Argentina. This began a wave of criticism against Peru's then coach Paulo Autuori, who boycotted the media, and his squad.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Paulo Autuori\nVenezuela 2007.\nPeru's campaign in the 2007 Copa América saw another futile attempt of the Peruvian squad, eliminated again in the quarter-finals by Argentina; the blame for this was mainly given to the tactics and formations of the coach Julio César Uribe, who did not call the appropriate players to the national team. After this situation, Peru replaced Uribe for José del Solar.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Julio César Uribe\nArgentina 2011.\nPeru made its debut against Uruguay, with a 1–1 draw, with Paolo Guerrero scoring for Peru. A 1–0 win over Mexico came next and finally a 1–0 loss against Chile, which it suffered due to a 90th minute own goal of a corner kick, would qualify Peru to the next round. At the quarter-finals match, Peru faced Colombia. All analysts placed Colombia as the big favorites. Peru, however, managed to win 2–0 after extra time with goals from Carlos Lobatón and Juan Manuel Vargas. At the semi-finals, Peru lost against the eventual champion Uruguay. Peru moved on to the third place match against the other surprise of the tournament, Venezuela. Peru beat Venezuela thoroughly with a 4–1 victory. A hat-trick by Paolo Guerrero, the Peruvian star of the tournament, fueled Peru and allowed them to claim the third-place bronze medal at the Copa América. Paolo Guerrero was crowned as the top goal scorer of the tournament.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Sergio Markarián\nChile 2015.\nThe Peruvian team was one of the 12 participating teams in the 2015 Copa América, a tournament that took place between June 11 and July 4, 2015, in Chile. The Peruvian team played his thirtieth Copa América and the fifteenth consecutive. In the draw held on November 24, 2014, in Viña del Mar, Peru was paired in Group C along with Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. Peru's debut in the competition occurred on June 14, 2015, losing 2:1 to Brazil. Four days later he got his first victory by defeating Venezuela by a score of 1:0. Peru closed its participation in the first phase with a goalless draw against Colombia. Peru added four points which allowed them to occupy second place in their group and advance to the next phase. In the quarterfinals, they faced the Bolivian team, which they won 3:1 with 3 goals from Paolo Guerrero. In the next round they faced the Chilean team, where the locals were victorious 2:1 with two goals from Eduardo Vargas. In the match for third place, the Peruvian team faced Paraguay, the match ended with a 2:0 victory, with goals from André Carrillo and Paolo Guerrero.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Ricardo Gareca\nUSA 2016.\nIn the draw held on February 21, 2016, in New York, the Peruvian team was in Group B along with Haiti, Brazil and Ecuador. The team's debut in the competition took place on June 4, 2016, defeating Haiti 1:0. Four days later they drew 2:2 against Ecuador. Peru closed its participation in the first phase with a 1:0 victory against Brazil. The Peruvian team added seven points which allowed him to occupy the first place in his group and advance to the next phase.\nIn the quarterfinals, they faced the Colombian team with which they tied 0:0 in regulation time, they were finally defeated 4:2 in the penalty shootout. With this result, Peru ranked fifth. The team's top scorers were Raúl Ruidíaz, Edison Flores, Christian Cueva and Paolo Guerrero with one goal each.\nSquad.\nHead coach: Ricardo Gareca\n \n \n \n "

YSJ BC is notable for being the longest standing club of the university and has an affiliation to British Rowing.\nThe club has Men's and Women's squads and is one of the many clubs of the York St John Students' Union. The majority of members learn to row on arrival at university. YSJBC welcomes students, alumni and staff to participate in the club.\nThe boathouse is based beside the River Ouse, opposite York City Rowing Club between Lendal Bridge and the Scarborough Railway Bridge next to the Museum Gardens.\nBoathouse and facilities.\nThe club's boathouse sits on 21 km of row-able water, on the River Ouse; it is approximately 12 km downstream from 'The Split' (where the Nidd and Ouse meet, but where on approaching from York the rivers 'split') and 9 km upstream from Naburn Lock. The stone and concrete boathouse nestles into land adjacent to the Museum Gardens. The building replaced the wooden boathouse at the bottom of Marygate in York during an early heyday for the club in the 1960s at the request of the then St John's College Principal, Canon Lamb, by the George Pace firm of architects, who also refurbished the College Chapel and built a new Chapel in 1966.\nRacing.\nThe club competes at a number of regattas and head races throughout the academic year (September - August). Prior to Christmas the club's main focus is BUCS competition and the York Small Boats Head. These events provide developing crews with the academic year's first taste of inter-university competition and the beginner crews with the first chance to apply what they have learnt in race conditions. The club also sends its athletes to the National Indoor Rowing Championships.\nAfter Christmas, the club enters a number of events during the continuing head season. These include Durham Small Boats Head and a Varsity match against the University of York Boat Club. From 2010 the club has entered the women's and men's Head of the River Races too. Following further training in the Easter vacation the summer sees attendance at the York Spring Regatta, the BUCS Regatta and other regional regattas such as Doncaster, Durham, Bradford, Tees and York Summer.\nKit and blades.\nClub members race in a tri-colour kit. It is Royal Blue and Sky Blue and White side stripes. In addition to this, the vast majority of the club own numerous other items of kit including the ubiquitous splash jacket A rowing splash jacket is a wind and splash proof, ventilated, long-sleeved jacket that is designed for rowing and bankside activity. The Club crest is similar to the York St John University crest but includes two rowing blades with the blade colours.\nThe current blades are Sky Blue with a Royal Blue 'Y\" representing the geographical location of the club, York. The previous blades were white with three chevrons; bottle green, gold and black (green nearest the blade tip) on a white background."

It rapidly grew popularity in the mid 2010s, following the slight successes of the Nepalese cricket team as well as the country's explosive rise in social media and television viewing influence from neighboring country India. It is played by many people throughout the country, especially in the Terai region. The biggest cricketing achievement of the national cricket team was when the team reached the qualification tournament of 2014 ICC World T20 held in Bangladesh. Nepal's playing season runs from September to November and starts again in March before finishing in May. As of October 2023, there were 3400 senior cricket clubs and over 35000 registered players in Nepal.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nIn 1920s Cricket was introduced to Nepal for the first time by Lt.-Gen.Madan Shumsher JBR youngest son of Rana Prime Minister Maharaja Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana. But at the time, cricket was considered a \"gentleman's game\" so was limited to the ruling Rana family members and some elites of Nepal. Though the game was kept within themselves and other members of the elite, the Cricket Association of Nepal was formed in 1946 to promote cricket amongst the aristocracy.\nAfter the introduction of democracy through the Revolution of 1951, cricket began to spread to the rest of the population. In 1961, in an effort to promote cricket to the whole of Nepal, the Cricket Association of Nepal became part of the National Sports Council. Nevertheless, the National games tended to be limited to Kathmandu until the 1980s.\nICC and ACC Membership.\nImprovements to the communication and transport infrastructure in Nepal allowed the game to expand outside Kathmandu in the 1980s, and Nepal became an Affiliate Member of the ICC in 1988. A major development programme began in the early 1990s, with regional and district tournaments established and cricket being promoted in the schools. Nepal became an Associate Member of the ACC in 1990 and became a full member in 1994.\nInterest in cricket increased quickly in the 1990s, and demand to play was such that the number of teams in tournaments had to be restricted until more facilities could be built.\n1996-Present.\nNepal became an Associate Member of the ICC in 1996, which was the year the national side played for the first time, in the ACC Trophy in Kuala Lumpur. Nepal finished fourth out of six teams in their first round group in this competition, beating Brunei and Japan. The achievement of this era was the historic win against Bangladesh in the 1999 ACC Trophy.\nNepal secured a 2002 Asia cup place but due to India Pakistan tension Asia cup didn't happen. During the 2004-2008 era Nepal U19 is at the peak. They beat New Zealand in the U19 World Cup. One of the significant turning points came in 2008 when they secured the ICC World Cricket League Division Five title. \nNepal played their first T20I World Cup in Bangladesh 2014 where they defeated Hong Kong and Afghanistan. Since then, Nepali cricket's fan following has been increasing day by day. \nAt 2016 U19 World Cup Nepal performed outstanding and reached quarter final. In 2018 Nepal secured a ODI status for the next 5 years after the win against PNG in ICC ODI World Cup Qualifier at Zimbabwe.\nGoverning Body.\nThe Cricket Association of Nepal is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Nepal. It was formed in 1946.\nInternational ground.\nThere are 65 grounds in Nepal with 17 turf wickets, but international matches can be played only at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in Kirtipur and Upper Mulpani Cricket Ground on the outskirts of Kathmandu. The Pokhara Cricket Ground is the only other ground to host international cricket having hosted the women's tournament at the 2019 South Asian Games.\nInternational cricket.\nMen's National Team.\nThe Nepal National Cricket Team represents Nepal in international cricket matches.\nNepal have been participating in international cricket since 1996 when they competed in the 1996 ACC Trophy. They have competed in numerous tournaments over the years including the ICC Trophy (later the ICC World Cup Qualifier), the ICC Intercontinental Cup. The team gained T20 International status for the first time in 2013 after qualifying for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 which was their first and only appearance at a major ICC event. The team also gained One Day International status in 2018 after finishing 8th in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\nOne Day International.\nThe Nepalese team took part in their first one-day international on 1 August 2018 against the Netherlands national team at the VRA Cricket Ground in Amstelveen and registered its first win two days later against them at the same ground. Nepal hosted its first one-day international against the United States national team at the Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on 8 February 2020. Nepal is currently competing in the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 which is their first one-day international tournament.\nT20 International.\nNepal faced Hong Kong in their first Twenty20 international game on 16 March 2014 at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 which was their first and only appearance at a major ICC event. Nepal won two of their three matches in the tournament with wins against Hong Kong and Afghanistan and a loss against Bangladesh (their first international match against a full member) as they failed to make it past the first round on net run rate.

Kandurata competed in all three provincial tournaments:the first class cricket competition known as the Inter-Provincial First Class Tournament, the List A cricket competition known as the Inter-Provincial Limited Over Tournament and the Twenty20 competition known as the Inter-Provincial Twenty20.\nKandurata is the current champion of Inter-Provincial Limited Over Tournament, and has won title in 2010–11, 2009–10, and the joint title in 2007–08 series. In 2007/08 Inter-provincial Limited overs tournament, Kandurata reached the finals by winning all their round robin matches, but the game was washed out due to rain.\nName.\nFrom the commence of Inter-Provincial Cricket Tournament, the team representing Central Province is known as Central province team. But from the 2007/08 season, the team known as \"Kandurata\" team. \"Kandurata\" is Sinhala for \"Hill country\". The hills or central highlands are mainly situated in central province.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1990–2000).\nSri Lanka Cricket fearing that Club cricket alone would not be enough to keep Sri Lankan cricket competitive, the Inter-Provincial Cricket Tournament was created as a domestic first-class cricket tournament in Sri Lanka in 1990. From the inauguration of the tournament, in 1990, participating teams varied from year to year. The tournament started with four provincial teams. They were Western Province, Southern Province, North Western Province and Kandurata.\nIn the first first-class Inter-provincial tournament, which was called the 1990 Singer Inter-Provincial Trophy, Kandurata, then called Central Province, captained by J.R.Ratnayeke, had come second out of the four provinces, losing none but second to Western Province on points, with 11.4. Western Province went on to win the tournament, not losing a game.\nEstablishment of Twenty20 (2000–2010).\nWith the establishment of Twenty20 cricket in 2003, it came to Sri Lanka in 2004 as the Twenty20 Tournament, however this was replaced with the Inter-Provincial Twenty20 in 2008. Wayamba won the 2007–08 Inter-Provincial Twenty20, which was the first edition of the tournament. They had won four out of five matches in the group stage and eventually won their way into the finals with Ruhuna. Wayamba won by 31 runs.\nGrounds and Sponsorship.\nThe team's home ground was Asgiriya Stadium, in Kandy. Which was later changed to Pallekele International Cricket Stadium once it was fully constructed.\nPallekele International Cricket Stadium is one of the newest cricket stadiums in Sri Lanka and the newest in the city of Kandy. The stadium was declared opened on 27 November 2009. The stadium is located about a half-hour drive from Kandy. The Pallekele stadium is wholly owned by Sri Lanka Cricket and is set to displace the Asgiriya Stadium, which has hosted Tests from 1983 to 2007, as the international venue of choice around Kandy. The stadium was built by the State Engineering Corporation of Sri Lanka and is designed along the lines of SuperSport Park in Centurion, South Africa.\nMas Holdings, a Sri Lankan apparel industrial firm is the team's sponsor.\nPlayers.\nKandurata has some reputed Test cricket players such as Kumar Sangakkara and Muttiah Muralitharan. Unlike in India and Australia, where cricketers represent their home province or state, it is the norm in Sri Lanka for outside cricketers to play for another province in Inter-Provincial Tournament. This is because uneven distribution of cricketer population among provinces. Therefore, it resulted in players like Nishantha Ranatunga and Sanjeeva Ranatunga from Western Province, where the most cricketing population occurs, playing in Kandurata or Central Province.\nCurrent squad.\nPlayers with Test caps are listed in bold. One Day International caps in \"italics.\"\nNotable players.\nThe following is a list of notable players who have represented both Kandurata and Sri Lanka."

        "text": "The World Championships of Ski Mountaineering are biannually held ski mountaineering competitions.\nHistory.\nThe events were originally sanctioned by the International Council for Ski Mountaineering Competitions (ISMC). The first official world mastership of the ISMC was carried out in the \"International Year of Mountains\" (2002), declared by the United Nations. The championship was held in Serre Chevalier, France, from January 24 to January 27, 2002. Prior the Italian Trofeo Mezzalama was held as \"World Championship of Ski Mountaineering\" with the classes \"Civilians\", \"Soldiers\" and \"Mountain guides\" in 1975. Because the ISMC merged into the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF) in 2008, the next championships were sanctioned by the ISMF. In 2011, the originally planned 9th edition of the European Championships of Ski Mountaineering at last was held as 6th edition of the World Championships.\nFurther venues of the ISMC World Championships were the Aran Valley (Spain) in 2004, the Italian Province of Cuneo in 2006, and Portes du Soleil (Switzerland) in 2008. The World Championships are supported by the national organizations of the carrying out countries.\nRatings.\nThe disciplines are rated by gender and age groups. In 2002, only individual and team (2 racers) races were held and rated, added with a combined ranking. At the 2004 championship a relay event and a vertical race competition were added. The men's relay teams were of four racers and the women's teams of three. In the following years all relay teams were of four ski mountaineers. In 2006 the relay race was canceled because of bad snow conditions, and consequently there was no combined ranking. At the 2008 World Masterships a long-distance race was added.\nThe national squads are often mixed with up an coming athletes of the \"Espoirs\"-level. Some nations do not have squads with enough racers for all disciplines."

        "title": "West Indian cricket team in England in 2009",
        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured England for a two-match Test series and a three-match ODI series from 6 to 26 May 2009. They toured in place of Zimbabwe.\nAt the start of the summer, the English players at a meeting identified this West Indian visit as pivotal to their momentum-making efforts for the Ashes later that season.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nDay 1: Ravi Bopara made his second century (at 207 balls), and England closed the day with 289/7. Fidel Edwards took 4 wickets for 53 runs.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 2: England closed the first innings with 377 runs. West Indies only scored 152 runs in their innings, and Strauss enforced the follow on. West Indies closed the day with 39/2. Graham Onions, on his Test debut, took 5 wickets for 38 runs.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 3 The West Indies finally ended their second innings with a lead of 31 runs. England quickly reached this target, and won the first Test in a series for the first time in 15 attempts. This was also the first win at Lord's since 2005. Chanderpaul ended the match with only 4 runs and a duck, his lowest match total in his career.\n2nd Test.\nDay 1: England won the toss and elected bat. Bopara and Cook scored centuries (108 &amp; 126* respectly). Bopara scored his third consecutive century (all vs West Indies); he is the first Englishman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to achieve this feat. England closed the day on 302 for 2.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 2: There was no play on the second day because of rain.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 3: Alastair Cook closed his innings with 160 runs, his highest test score, and led to England to 569 for 6, before the declaration by Strauss. West Indies closed the day on 94 for 3, Anderson took 3 wickets for 28 runs.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 4: After tea, West Indies ended their second innings with 310 runs and Strauss enforced the follow-on, for the second time in the series. In 22 overs, West Indies scored 115 runs for 3 wickets.&lt;br&gt;\nDay 5: After showers limited play at the beginning of the day, England bowled the West Indies out for 176 by the third over after lunch. Paul Collingwood replaced the injured Matt Prior as wicketkeeper, and Anderson took 4 wickets while conceding just 18 runs.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nThe first ODI was abandoned at 15:00, after torrential morning rain left the newly relaid outfield saturated.\n2nd ODI.\nEngland won the toss and chose to field, bowling strongly and defensively, with Stuart Broad taking four for 46 and Paul Collingwood three for 16 from six overs. Graeme Swann, the England off-spinner, described as \"exceptional\" the efforts of his seam-bowling counterparts. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo made the best partnership of the West Indian innings with 63 runs for the fourth wicket. Collingwood was unbeaten on 47 in England's innings, as they won the game with 14 overs to spare. The West Indian captain Chris Gayle played his 200th ODI. Eoin Morgan played his first match with England, he previously played 23 One Day Internationals with Ireland.\n3rd ODI.\nThe Englishmen were delighted to bat first, keen as they were to put themselves to the test in the total-setting stakes, and passed with something like aplomb. Swann was especially impressed with and pleased for Matt Prior, whose 87 he dubbed \"brilliant\". Prior had previously been picked apart for his persistent failure to convert starts into substantial scores. Swann also drew attention to the fact that this constituted England's second successive win without both Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff, and opined that the team was beginning to look \"formidable\", having amply fulfilled its goals for the series. \"D-day is now looming,\" he wrote in reference to the Ashes. \"I can't wait!\""

        "title": "Andrés Rodríguez (basketball)",
        "text": "Andrés Guillermo Rodríguez Fernández (born February 27, 1981) is a Puerto Rican professional basketball player, who last played for Atenienses de Manatí of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional. He was born in Puerto Rico, where he debuted as a professional basketball played for the Criollos de Caguas in 1999. Rodríguez attended University of Louisville and American University, completing his college education in 2004. Afterwards, he migrated to Europe, where he first played for Olimpija Ljubljana and had his best season by leading the Liga ACB in assists per game in 2013 with Obradoiro CAB. While concurrently playing in Puerto Rico, Rodríguez won three BSN championships for two different teams. Internationally, he is a member of the Puerto Rico national basketball team.\nEarly and college career.\nRodríguez began his college career in 1999 after graduating from Colegio San Ignacio de Loyola, joining the University of Louisville after becoming a walk on member of the Cardinals squad as a freshman. He debuted on December 15 playing only four minutes, recovering a rebound and stealing a ball. In his next appearance, Rodríguez scored a free throw and stole two balls. In his final appearance for Louisville, he only played a minute and recorded a steal. That same year, he debuted as a professional in his native Puerto Rico for the Criollos de Caguas of the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN). In 2001, he transferred to American University. In seasons 2001–02, 2002–03 and 2003–04 played in the Patriot League Championship for the institution's team, the Eagles. Rodríguez completed a finance major, graduating with an average of 3.62 and forming part of the honor roll. Afterwards, he planned a move back to Puerto Rico in order to study law, but a basketball agent convinced him to pursue professional tryouts.\nPlaying in Europe and return to the BSN.\nRodríguez has a playing style that is decidedly centered around teamwork, something that made him a better fit for European teams. He was able to make a quick and successful transition shortly after graduating from college, joining Olimpija Ljubljana of the Premier A Slovenian Basketball League. Rodríguez recognized that the stark contrast presented by his style in a fast-paced league like the BSN was a hindrance that prevented him from melding for several years. However, he consistently returned to play in Puerto Rico during the international offseason. By his second postgrad year, Rodríguez had established a presence in the European market, signing with BC Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Basketball Super League. His first multi-year stint was with PGE Turów Zgorzelec of the Polish Basketball League. Back in the BSN during the offseason, Rodríguez formed part of the first Criollos team to win the league championship.\nRodríguez began the 2008–09 season by completing his first stay in the Liga ACB by completing the pre-season with Caja Laboral. Afterwards, he signed with BC Donetsk of the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague. The following season, Rodríguez returned to the Liga ACB, this time joining Obradoiro CAB. After two seasons of absence, Rodríguez returned to the BSN in 2010, becoming the regular point guard of the Capitanes de Arecibo. Under his lead, the team won back to back championships. In his return to the Liga ACB with Blusens Monbus, Rodríguez lead the league in assists and the team unexpectedly advanced to the post season. This directly limited his participation with the Capitanes. In November 2013, the Capitanes traded him to the Cangrejeros de Santurce in exchange for Walter Hodge and Jonathan Han. Still nursing a knee injury, Rodríguez decided not to pursue an international contract in order to rehabilitate.\nOn November 19, 2014, he signed with Baloncesto Fuenlabrada. On February 16, 2015, he parted ways with Fuenlabrada.\nNational team career.\nRodríguez made his international debut by playing for the youth versions of the Puerto Rico national basketball team. He made his debut for the adult team at the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, where Puerto Rico won the gold medal. Rodríguez was included in the preliminary lists for several events held in 2010, but he was not selected by coach Manuel Cintrón. Due to the fact that his father, Luis Dominic Rodríguez, was born in the Dominican Republic he considered joining the Dominican Republic national basketball team if no interest was shown, but ultimately disregarded this idea by noting that playing for Puerto Rico had always been his preference. After Cintrón was fired from the team, Rodríguez was included in the team that participated in the 2011 FIBA Americas Championship by Flor Meléndez.\nHe was initially meant to serve as a third backup point guard, but the coach's strategy of using Carlos Arroyo and José Barea at once placed him in charge of a defensive backup squad. Puerto Rico was unable to classify with a narrow 2-point loss to Argentina, but classified to the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament for Men. The following year, Rodríguez joined the B squad that won silver at the Centrobasket championship. He repeated his previous role at the Olympic Qualifying Tournament. However, another narrow loss costed them the opportunity to classify to the Olympics and eventually lead to the termination of Meléndez. Under coach Paco Olmos, Rodriguez returned in his backup role and joined the team for the 2013 FIBA Americas Championship, which classified directly for the 2014 FIBA World Cup by winning the silver medal.\nPersonal life.\nRodríguez is married to Adienid Muñiz. The couple's first child, Antoneo Andrés Rodríguez Muñiz, was born on October 27, 2012, while his father was playing abroad for Blusens Monbus. Before playing in the fifth game of the season, Muñiz was taken to Hospital La Rosaleda in Santiago de Compostela for a routine checkup after experiencing some discomfort, while Rodríguez proceeded to the game where they were supposed to rendezvous. However, once there she entered labor to the surprise of both, since the birth was expected to take place a month after. In 2015, the couple had their first daughter."

        "text": "Elections to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for 2011 proceeded according to the rules revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players. The new Expansion Era Committee, which replaced the Veterans Committee, convened in December 2010 to select from an Expansion Era ballot of long-retired players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport from 1973 to the present time, called the \"Expansion Era\" by the Hall of Fame.\nThe Hall of Fame induction class of 2011 consisted of players Roberto Alomar and Bert Blyleven, elected by the BBWAA, and executive Pat Gillick, elected by the Committee, who formally entered the Hall on July 24, 2011, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.\nFor the first time, the Hall of Fame extended its induction festivities over a weekend. On the day before the main induction ceremony, the Hall of Fame hosted the first Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. Two annual awards for media excellence, the Hall's own Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers, were presented at this ceremony. The irregularly presented Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award was also included in the ceremony. Previously, these awards were presented at the actual induction ceremony.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA ballot was announced on November 29, 2010. The BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1991 or later, but not after 2005; the ballot included candidates from the 2010 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2005. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nResults of the 2011 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 5, 2011. The writers' ballot consisted of 33 players–14 candidates returning from the 2010 ballot, plus 19 first-time candidates, the most since the ballot's 24 newcomers. Voters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Write-in votes were not permitted.\nA record 581 ballots were cast (including five ballots which supported no candidates), with 436 votes required for election. A total of 3,474 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.98 per ballot. Any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be inducted. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Expansion Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated with a dagger (†). The candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nDave Parker was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe two candidates who earned Hall of Fame induction, Alomar and Blyleven, fell short of induction in 2010 by fewer than 10 votes—the first time in history that two candidates had done so in the same election.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 25 All-Stars, nine of whom were not on the writers' ballot, representing a total of 60 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 6-time All Star Kevin Brown, and 5-time All Stars Larry Walker and Benito Santiago. The field also included three Rookie-of-the-Year Award winners Jeff Bagwell, Raúl Mondesí and Santiago. Walker won seven Gold Glove Awards for the right field position. Juan González won six Silver Slugger Awards in the outfield.\nThe new candidates on the 2011 ballot included three MVP Award winners: Jeff Bagwell (1994 NL), Walker (1997 NL), and González (1996 and 1998 AL). Also eligible was Rafael Palmeiro, who recorded over 3000 hits and 500 home runs, which would typically foreshadow a first-ballot election; however, his candidacy has generated controversy due to his testing positive for steroids. Palmeiro has steadfastly maintained his innocence in the steroid controversy, stating that he must have tested positive due to a tainted B12 injection. Ongoing debate about the influence of steroids on the game in the 1990s was widely believed to have affected the vote totals for several power hitters on the ballot, including McGwire, Bagwell, Walker and Gonzalez, regardless of whether they had ever tested positive for steroid use or had even been accused of involvement with steroids; the top five vote-getters were either pitchers or middle infielders with relatively few home runs. Walker's candidacy was also affected by voters' assessment of his extreme home/away statistical splits, attributed by many to the fact that he spent slightly more than half his career with hitter's paradise Coors Field as his home park, though he also spent several years playing in the more pitching-friendly Olympic Stadium. Many candidates may simply have been seeking to remain on the ballot for 2012, when a generally weaker field of candidates is expected, with the most prominent new candidates including Bernie Williams, Rubén Sierra, Vinny Castilla, Eric Young, Tim Salmon, Brad Radke and Danny Graves.\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the writers' ballot were: Terry Adams, Wilson Álvarez, Brian Anderson, James Baldwin, Pat Borders, Ricky Bottalico, Frank Castillo, Roger Cedeño, Jason Christiansen, Wil Cordero, Midre Cummings, Cal Eldred, John Flaherty, Buddy Groom, Jeffrey Hammonds, Dave Hansen, Félix Heredia, Denny Hocking, Al Levine, Luis López, Matt Mantei, Dave McCarty, Jim Mecir, Ramiro Mendoza, Mike Mordecai, Greg Myers, C. J. Nitkowski, José Offerman, Keith Osik, Antonio Osuna, Eddie Pérez, Jay Powell, Paul Quantrill, Steve Reed, Rey Sánchez, Ugueth Urbina, Ismael Valdez, Gabe White, Matt Whiteside, Gerald Williams and Dan Wilson. José Lima, who last played in the major leagues in 2006 and died on May 23, 2010, was eligible for consideration in this round of balloting – similar to the inclusion on the ballot of Darryl Kile and Rod Beck in 2003 and 2008 respectively – but was not placed on the ballot. Under Hall of Fame rules, an otherwise eligible player who dies before being retired 5 years becomes eligible in the first election held at least 6 months after his death.\nExpansion Era Committee.\nIn keeping with the new Hall of Fame voting procedure, the Historical Overview Committee identified 12 Expansion Era candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions from 1973 to present. Along with the 1973 to present time era, these rules defined the consideration set:\nHistorical Overview Committee (eleven veteran BBWAA members): Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Moss Klein (formerly \"Newark Star-Ledger\"); Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"); Ken Nigro (formerly \"The Baltimore Sun\"); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Nick Peters (formerly \"Sacramento Bee\"); Tracy Ringolsby (FSN Rocky Mountain); and Mark Whicker (\"Orange County Register\").\nThe Expansion Era ballot was originally scheduled for release in October but was delayed until November 8, 2010. The 12 Expansion Era Candidates were eight players, one manager, and three executives. The sole candidate who was elected is indicated in bold italics.\nAll except Martin and Steinbrenner were living when the ballot and results were announced. Martin and Miller were holdovers from the most recent ballots covering managers and executives (2010), and Oliver was a holdover from the most recent ballot covering post-1942 players (2009).\nThe new Expansion Era Committee (16-members appointed by the Hall's Board of Directors) was announced at the same time as the final ballot:\nThe Committee convened at the 2010 winter meetings in Orlando, Florida with the standard 75% or 12 of 16 votes required for election and July 2011 Hall of Fame induction. Results were announced at 10:00 am EST on December 6.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded the previous day. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three nominees for the 2011 award were Bob Elliott of the \"Toronto Sun\", Bill Conlin of the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", and Joe Giuliotti of the \"Boston Herald\". This was the third consecutive year Elliott had been nominated and the second for Giuliotti.\nUnder BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2010 World Series or at the 2010 winter meetings. The winner of the 2011 J. G. Taylor Spink Award, announced at the winter meetings, was Bill Conlin, who received 188 votes from the 434. Elliott received 160 votes. Joe Giuliotti got 83 votes. Three blank ballots were among those submitted.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now presented the previous day. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. The recipient was announced on December 8, 2010 at the winter meetings, following a vote by the same committee that selected seven of the finalists (below).\nTen finalists were announced in October 2010. In accord with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists. Three were selected from a list of candidate by fan voting in September 2010 at the Hall's Facebook page.\nFive candidates were living when the ballot was announced—the active McCarver, Nadel, and Van Horne; and the retired Cárdenas and Doucet.\nOn December 8, Dave Van Horne, the lead play-by-play announcer for the Florida Marlins (now Miami Marlins) on the team's radio network, was named as the recipient. He began his career with the Richmond Braves in the Triple-A International League before joining the English-language radio broadcast team for the Montreal Expos in their inaugural year of 1969. He remained with the Expos through 2000 before joining the Marlins in 2001. He also called the Expos' last home game in Montreal in 2004 as a member of the visiting Marlins broadcast team. He has also called games on The Baseball Network, and called three World Series and National League Championship Series for Canadian networks, in addition to the Marlins' 2003 World Series victory.\nThe Frick Award is Van Horne's second award for broadcasting excellence from a baseball hall of fame. In 1996, he received the Jack Graney Award, given irregularly for excellence in either writing or broadcasting, from the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Van Horne became the second Frick Award winner, after recipient Tony Kubek, to have called games for a Canadian team, and also the second Marlins broadcaster to receive the Frick Award, after recipient Felo Ramírez.\nBuck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award.\nThe Hall presented its Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award for the second time. The award was created in 2008 in honor of Buck O'Neil, a Negro leagues star who went on to become one of baseball's leading ambassadors until his death in 2006. The first award was presented posthumously to O'Neil at the 2008 induction ceremony. According to the Hall,\nAs with the media awards, recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. The Hall accepts written nominations for the award by mail at any time; the nomination must specifically state how the nominee meets the traits exemplified by O'Neil.\nRoland Hemond received the O'Neil Award at the Awards Presentation. He first came to prominence as the assistant scouting director of the Milwaukee Braves in the 1950s, and became the first scouting director of the Los Angeles Angels in 1961. From there, Hemond went on to be general manager of the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, winning the MLB Executive of the Year Award three times (1972 and 1983 in Chicago, 1989 in Baltimore). He went to the newly created Arizona Diamondbacks as Senior Executive Vice President in 1996, seeing them through their MLB debut in 1998. Hemond returned to the White Sox as an adviser in 2001, and to the Diamondbacks in 2007 as a special assistant to the president, a position he still holds.\nOutside the front office, Hemond is president of the Association of Professional Baseball Players of America, which provides financial and other assistance to individuals connected with professional baseball. He also helped found the Professional Baseball Scouts Foundation, a similar organization focused on assisting veteran scouts who need special support."

        "title": "1884 New Zealand rugby union tour of New South Wales",
        "text": "The first New Zealand team was selected in 1884, for a tour to New South Wales, Australia. It was a privately organised selection as the New Zealand Rugby Union was founded not until eight years later. On 22 May 1884, before the tour start, the team played a test match against the Wellington Rugby Football Union team, winning 9 to 0. During the tour, the team recorded eight wins in eight matches in Australia.\nMatch summary.\nComplete list of matches played by New Zealand in New South Wales:\nMatch details.\nNorthern Districts.\nMatch Report, Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners Advocate of 6 Jun 1884    \nNEW ZEALANDERS v. COMBINED NEWCASTLE TEAM.\nVICTORY FOR THE VISITORS.\nThe long-looked forward to match between the New Zealand footballers and a combined local team, came off on the Newcastle Cricket Club's ground yesterday afternoon. It proved, as will be seen, an easy victory for the Maori-landers, by twenty-nine points to nil.\nAbout daylight signs of rain appeared, and up till breakfast hour a few drops fell. Later on, heavy clouds banked up, and showers commenced, the wind hauling to the south. Subsequently, the sun conquered, and bright warm weather lasted until noon; when once more the horizon darkened, and a renewal of the downpour commenced. Ten minutes before the advertised time for kicking off (3 p.m.) building rain squalls were flying across the sward from the southward, and whispers went the round that postponement was inevitable.\nThis however, was not to be: seeing that the visitors are booked to play at Bathurst to-morrow. Exactly one and a quarter minute past 3 p.m., while the grandstand was packed like a sardine case with beauty and muscle, both sexes vainly seeking to ward off the rain, and outsiders, huddled like so many storm overtaken bandicoots under every available shelter-place, the teams emerged, and took their positions. Newcastle won the toss and elected to play from the north side.\nIt was clear to onlookers that from the jump our boys were outweighted and had an uphill two hours' work before them. The struggle opened with a strong defence (so much of it as could be caught is glimpse of between the squalls), and after a little by-play the New Zealanders forced down; following up speedily by a second. The local men followed suit, and J. Woods was put on to kick off; but proved unlucky, owing to the slippery state of the ball; which was every moment whirling through water-pools or greasy mud. Fred Lockhead led off with a good attempt at a run in, and on the ball going up, Greaves held his own with some careful dribbling for the Newcastilians. A scrimmage followed-the first of the day by which the superior weight and centralized play of our visitors commenced to shew their generalship in working up being of thorough draught-board fashion. \"Tommy\" Johnson's weight and \"go\" shewed up 'brilliantly when called on, but the ball found its way down to the visitors' end for a long while. Before anything decisive had occurred, a second blinding squall came up, rendering the sward a seething mass of spray, water, and foam; thunder growling angrily all around, and forked lightning flashing at all points of the compass, whilst the contestants flitted around like so many grey ghosts chasing a shadow. Under such circumstances genuine play was all but out of the question. No grip of the ball was obtainable. When caught it slipped like an eel; and on colliding or falling, player after player shot like Scotch curling stones several yards along the turf before bringing up to a standstill. The Newcastle men soon after scored their first and only touch-down; the kick-off. being entrusted to J. Wood, who made a good attempt for a goal. Following off, Greaves made a splendid lift, which Johnson backed up by nearly getting a touch-down; but a New Zealand man, slipping in, made a big dash and forced down. W. Langwill secured the leather after a few scrimmages, and with a brilliant run and dodging carried it opposite the grandstand but got out of bounds. Wood was next to score for the home team, but the visitors again forced down five minutes later, near the goal. The N.Z. captain was soon after sent heavily to mother earth, when nearly finishing a smart run in, but further force down was called. \"Get into the scrimmage better, blues\" followed as the order, which was well responded to; despite game responses by the local men. Ford and Langwill and W. Laing essayed, but the latter was cleverly floored by the Maori, just before getting in. The next force down was made at the northern end, followed speedily by another, after some good generalship. The kick missed but following an immediate scrimmage a blue skied the ball clean over the fences and scored first goal. J. Woods kicked off and after hard play, the next goal was scored by a blue through a chance kick out of a scrimmage, at twenty minutes to 4 p.m. The Newcastle forwards at this. stage began to improve, working well through them. Laing again got it and made another dash, but minus result when half-time was called.\nOnly a few minutes' spell was allowed, when the blues kicked away to the southward, and followed passing and scrimmaging, barren of results, till the ball went nearly out of bounds at the southern end, and was then dribbled into a water-hole near the Grandstand, and blue once more forced down; the players looking like a cage of mud-bespattered drowned rats. Seven minutes' scrimmage ensued in midfield, when a herculean young visitor was running it in, but was smartly collared and floored by Laurence. Ford made a fine kick of seventy or eighty yards on to the toe of a Maori man, who immediately shot the ball out of bounds, and a fierce scrimmage took place in which a chance goal was nearly scored. The visitors secured the chance of a kick, and Taiaroa, with his left foot, lauded another splendid goal. Newcastle's first kick went prettily over the goal posts, but of course did not count; and another touchdown speedily fell to the strangers; the Maori this time missing kick. Bode and Johnson made two collars; one of their opponents getting a nasty bruise on his brow. Another force down and free-kick claimed by NZ., but the try missed, and the twenty-seventh scrimmage ensued.  Taiaroa later on made a big effort to get in but was tripped and shot heels over head; the local men getting a free kick through off-side playing, but without scoring. Work now began to improve, and some brilliant runs we made on either slide the \"passing\" of the blues being beyond praise. Charge upon charge took place the Newcastle boys each time answering gamely and generally bringing the man down. A further touch down and a goal accredited to New Zealand with our men following with a strong effort to the northern end, whence they were sent by a high kick from one of the backs, and incessant scrimmaging followed, with very trying cross-field work, and constant out of bounds. The demon Taiaroa, later on, had the ball passed backwards to him, and with the dash of the day rushed it through all opposition, and touched down near the rails, after sliding several yards in a complete duck-pond of rain water, amid deafening cheers. The kick off failed, and shortly afterwards a most interesting and well contested match was closed by time. Three cheers were exchanged lustily; and a like honour having been paid to the Queen, the ground was cleared. It may not be generally known that the player Taiaroa has had his collar-bone fractured no fewer than three times.\nThe actual result was a win for the New Zealanders by five goals and three tries to nil. Two of the goals dropped from the field."

        "text": "The 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup was the inaugural Women's Cricket World Cup, held in England between 20 June and 28 July 1973. It was the first tournament of its kind, held two years before the first limited overs World Cup for men in 1975. The competition was won by the hosts, England. The competition was the brainchild of businessman Sir Jack Hayward, who contributed £40,000 towards its costs.\nEngland, Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica were joined by an International XI and a Young England side in a round robin league which saw the top team win the World Cup. England topped the group with 20 points from their six matches, including five victories and one defeat, while Australia were runners up posting 17 points with four wins.\nThe final round robin match, held at Edgbaston on 28 July, was distinguished by a commanding century by Enid Bakewell of England, whose 118 formed the bedrock of England's imposing 279/3 in their 60 overs, with captain Rachael Heyhoe Flint scoring 64. Australia were restricted by tight England bowling and fell well short of their target, scoring 187/9. The cup was presented by Princess Anne and the winning England team were hosted at a reception at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Edward Heath.\nBakewell, one of England's finest all time players, was the leading run-scorer in the competition with 264 runs while Rosalind Heggs, of Young England, was the leading wicket-taker with 12 wickets. The next World Cup was held five years later in 1978."

        "title": "James O'Connor (rugby union)",
        "text": "James David O'Connor (born 5 July 1990) is an Australian professional rugby union footballer who currently plays for Queensland Reds in Super Rugby. He made his international debut for Australia in 2008 at the age of eighteen. He has played for the Western Force and Melbourne Rebels in Super Rugby. In 2013 he played for English Premiership side London Irish, and in the 2014–15 season he moved to France to play in the Top 14 competition for Toulon. His regular playing positions are Fly-half, Centre, Fullback and Wing.\nEarly life.\nO'Connor was born in Australia on the Gold Coast. He lived in Auckland for five years as a child, attending Rutherford Primary School, until the age of eleven when he returned to Australia with his family. O'Connor grew up playing rugby league and earned a scholarship from the Parramatta Eels. He eventually became a boarder at Nudgee College in Brisbane's northern suburbs.\nIn 2006 O'Connor suffered a ruptured spleen, but went on to be part of the Australian Schools representative team that played against England, Samoa and New Zealand in 2007.\nO'Connor's parents are from New Zealand, and his maternal grandparents from South Africa. This, along with his Australian birth, meant he was eligible for all three Tri Nations teams. However, his decision to play for the Wallabies, and debut in 2008, meant he became ineligible to play for the All Blacks or Springboks. He also played for the Australian Sevens in 2008.\nProfessional career.\nO'Connor became the youngest ever Super Rugby debutant at the age of 17, and the second youngest Wallaby in Australian rugby history at the age of 18.\n2008–2013: Early years.\nO'Connor joined the Force in 2008, and came off the bench for his first Super 14 cap in a match against the Reds in Week 10 of the 2008 season. He completed the season's final three matches running on at inside centre. Later that year he made his Australian debut, when he came off the bench as replacement fullback against Italy. He played Italy again in June 2009 scoring three tries to help Australia to a 31–8 win. In 2009, O'Connor was the Western Force 'Rookie of the Year' award and also won the Wallabies 'Rookie of the Year'.\nIn 2012 O'Connor commenced a two-year contract with the Melbourne Rebels. His teammates included Nic Stirzaker, fullback Kurtley Beale, centre Mitch Inman, and English international Danny Cipriani. He played at fly-half for the Wallabies in three Tests against the Lions and was included in a five-man leadership group for the team. After continued ill-discipline off the field, the Rebels withdrew from contract extension negotiations at the end of the 2013 Super Rugby season and he was released by the franchise.\nFollowing a number of off-field indiscretions on O'Connor's part and a drunken incident at Perth Airport, O'Connor's ARU top-up contract was torn up and was suspended from the remainder of the test season. Following this low, O'Connor was in talks with the Western Force and the Queensland Reds however, nothing eventuated and O'Connor was forced to ply his trade offshore.\n2013–2014: First European stint.\nOn 28 October 2013, O'Connor indicated that he was en route to London to play rugby for \"a few months\". He was signed by London Irish in October 2013 until the end of the 2013–14 season. He made his debut against Northampton Saints on 3 November and set up the only try that day. He claimed his first try for the club against Worcester Warriors on 4 January 2014, in a match ending 22–9 to the Exiles with O'Connor scoring all 22 points.\n2015: Super Rugby return and Wallabies comeback attempt.\nIn 2015, he returned to Super Rugby in a bid to make the Wallabies Rugby World Cup 2015 squad by playing for the Queensland Reds. O'Connor produced solid performances and was arguably one of the higher performers for a poor Queensland outfit, being shifted between fullback, flyhalf and wing in his first appearances before locking down the Red 15 jersey in the last rounds of the season.\nAlthough a part of Wallabies coach Michael Cheika's squads for Wallabies logistics camps throughout the course of the year, O'Connor was not included in the first extended 40-man and subsequently did not feature in any of the squads to follow, including the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad. O'Connor was announced to be part of Brisbane City's squad for their NRC title-defending campaign.\nOn 13 October, the QRU and Queensland Reds announced that O'Connor would be released from his contract effective immediately, meaning he would not play the 2016 Super Rugby season for the Reds and finish his 2-year contract. O'Connor's release also meant the end of a potential appearance for Brisbane City in the domestic NRC had he sufficiently recovered to play.\n2015–2019: Second European stint.\nIn 2015, after failing to make the Australian 2015 Rugby World Cup squad with the , O'Connor signed with Toulon, joining former Super Rugby and Wallabies teammates Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell and Quade Cooper. After allegations of cocaine use and Toulon decided not to renew his contract and thus he left the club at the ending of the season.\nIn 2017 O'Connor signed with English Premiership club Sale Sharks shortly before the 2017–18 season. After playing 31 games over 2 years, Sale Sharks agreed to a contract release, allowing him to pursue him ambition to play for Australia at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n2019–present: Return to Australia and Wallabies comeback.\nIn July 2019, O'Connor signed a 2-year deal with the Queensland Reds and Rugby Australia under what was understood to be strict behavioural clauses. He quickly made his way back into the Australian team for Australia's 47–26 win over New Zealand in Perth, and was subsequently selected in Australia's World Cup squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nStyle of play.\nO'Connor is a very versatile player, being able to play anywhere in the back line as a fly-half, centre, full-back or wing and is usually described as a utility back. When asked about his preferred position in 2009, he said, \"I feel more comfortable at 12 as a second ball player. I also like 15. You definitely get a lot of space. I just want to get on the field whether it is 10, 12 or 15.\" He is also an accurate goal-kicker.\nOff-field.\nControversies.\nO'Connor has been involved in a number of off-field controversies, attracting criticism from senior members of the Wallabies. In September 2013, he was stood down from the Wallabies following an incident in which he was removed from Perth airport by Australian Federal Police. As a result, O'Connor missed the final two matches of the 2013 Rugby Championship and was released from his Wallabies contract by the Australian Rugby Union. In February 2017 O'Connor was arrested together with former All Blacks player, Ali Williams, in Paris on suspicion of attempting to buy cocaine.\nMedia.\nO'Connor was a participant in the second season of reality competition series \"Australia's Greatest Athlete\"."

        "text": "The Midlands Rugby League Division Two is a summer rugby league tournament in the Midlands region of England. It was previously known as the Midlands Rugby League and the Midlands Merit League. Its season runs from April to August.\nHistory.\nThe \"Midlands Merit League\" was founded in late 2005 to support the growth of rugby league in non-heartland areas. The 2007 season saw the introduction of an informal under-15 league Midlands Junior League based on Merit League principles. In 2008 the junior competition featured under-14 and under-16 divisions.\nThe league was renamed RL Merit League (RLML) for the 2008 season due to its increased geographical spread with teams from the North of England taking part. 2009 saw the largest ever entry, with over 30 teams split into two Northern pools; \"Yorkshire and Humber\" and \"North West\" and the stand-alone Midlands Rugby League.\nIn 2012, the Rugby League Conference was replaced by regional leagues and the Midlands Rugby League took control of the RLC Midlands Premier Division and the RLC Midlands regional division. The old Midlands Rugby League continued as Division Two of the new Midlands pyramid.\nParticipating clubs.\nThe participating clubs in 2012 were:\nFormat.\nThe scoring system for 2010 for the Midlands Rugby League men's competition was as follows:\nWin: 3 points\nDraw: 2 points\nDefeat not conceded: 1 point\nDefault on game within three days of fixture: 0 points, with 24-0 score-line awarded to the opposition.\nThe average number of points scored per game, rather than the total, determines positions in the league table. Teams who have played 6 or more games will be placed higher in the table than those who haven't. If the average is the same, total games played followed by points difference will determine the placings.\nInter-league games between members of the Midlands Rugby League and the London League or RL Merit League can be counted as competitive matches, whilst both leagues are in season. These fixtures will need to be confirmed a week in advance to be guaranteed inclusion as regular season games.\nPast winners.\nFor the sake of completeness, previous Midlands competitions are included."

        "text": "William Clifford Richards (28 March 1901 – 13 February 1964) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Pontypool and Swansea and represented Wales at international level. Richards was a coal miner by trade, and worked in the pits all his adult life. In 1964, while working at the Navigation Colliery in Crumlin, he was killed in an underground accident.\nRugby career.\nRichards was first capped for Wales while playing first class rugby for Pontypool. His first international game was against England in the opening Welsh match of the 1922 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Tom Parker, Wales were convincing winners over a far more experienced England, running in eight tries, of which Richards scored one. The 1922 Wales Championship team, captained by Tom Parker, was noted for its stability, with only two changes throughout the entire campaign. Richards played in all four matches, though was initially dropped for the final match of the tournament against France. The selectors had originally chosen Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, but switched to Richards and Islwyn Evans, just minutes before kick-off, as they believed they would be better suited to the harder French sun-baked pitch. At the end of the Championship, Wales won three games and drew the match against Scotland, lifting the tournament as out-right winners.\nRichards played one final game for Wales, when he faced Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park, in the third Welsh match of the 1924 Five Nations Championship. Although Richards scored the second try of his international career, Wales still lost the game and Richards was not selected for Wales again.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "text": "This is a list of Kent County Cricket Club captains. Kent County Cricket Club was formed in 1842 and has played in the County Championship since its inception in 1890 and in List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket. The first match in which Kent have a named captain indicated on scorecards available occurred on 26–27 June 1856 when the county played MCC at Gravesend. South Norton captained the county on that occasion and throughout the period until 1870. The first official captain of the club was Lord Harris, an influential figure in the development of Kent and English cricket, who was appointed to the role in 1875. As of 2023, the current club captain is batsman Daniel Bell-Drummond who was appointed in October 2023, replacing Sam Billings.\nIn total 34 men have been officially appointed as the captain of the club. Colin Cowdrey captained the side a total of 250 times in first-class cricket and held the position for 15 years, the most of any player since the establishment of the County Championship. At times there have been multiple captains during a season or joint captains appointed. William Patterson, for example, captained the side five times during the 1891 and 1892 seasons towards the end of each season, the only times he was able to play regularly for the county during those seasons. For the majority of both seasons the official club captain was Frank Marchant. Similarly, Ian Akers-Douglas was the club captain for five games in the 1936 season. Akers-Douglas only captained Kent for seven matches in total, the fewest of any of the official club captains.\nOther players have captained the county in matches without being appointed the club captain. Peter Richardson has done so the most times in first-class matches, captaining Kent in 45 games, including 21 games in the 1963 season in place of official club captain Colin Cowdrey. In 2015 Sam Northeast captained the side on a number of occasions, including in all one-day matches, despite the club captain being Rob Key. Northeast captained the side after the beginning of the season even when Key was playing and succeeded him at the end of the season.\nKent won their first County Championship title in 1906, under the captaincy of Cloudesley Marsham, and have won the title on a further six occasions, including one shared title in 1977. Sides captained by Ted Dillon won the Championship three times in the period immediately before World War I. Mike Denness captained Kent to six one-day titles in the early 1970s.\nCaptains.\nBelow is a list of club captains appointed by Kent County Cricket Club or players who have been the sole known captain when no other has been appointed. Captains are listed in order of appointment."

He was a deputy sheriff in Norfolk, Virginia, he played college basketball at Morris Brown College, Biola University with the Harlem Wizards and Harlem Globetrotters show teams.\nBell was featured on the AMC show Freakshow, throughout its two seasons. In an interview for the show, he revealed that he had appeared as an alien who landed on top of the L.A. Coliseum at the closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He also appeared on season 4 of American Horror Story. He first showed signs of his impending tallness when he was 9 or 10, Bell said, but through high school he never grew so tall that he felt out of place. By the time he hit his early 20s, however, his height had exceeded 7 feet. When he last measured himself, about 20 years ago, he said, he was 7 feet 7 inches. But the measurements for the Guinness book showed he had grown another inch. Bell said he has a medical condition called gigantism, which causes excessive growth hormone secretion during childhood. He said he does not suffer from some of the other effects of gigantism, such as an enlarged heart, although he does have to take some medicines for the rest of his life."

        "text": "Jerry Drake (born July 9, 1969) is a former professional American football defensive lineman who spent six seasons with the Arizona Cardinals. He played college football at Hastings College.\nCollege career.\nA native of Kingston, New York, Drake played one year of college football at Ulster County Community College before the program was disbanded. He transferred to Hastings College, a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division II program, because he had some friends who attended the school. As a junior, Drake recorded 48 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 11 sacks, two fumble recoveries, one blocked kick, and seven pass breakups. As a senior, he recorded 32 solo tackles, two sacks, three interceptions, and three pass breakups. He was twice selected as a NAIA All-American. Drake also played in the semi-professional Empire Football League.\nProfessional career.\nDrake signed with the Cardinals as an undrafted free agent in April 1995. He was waived in August and re-signed to the team's practice squad. Drake was promoted to the active roster in late November. He made his NFL debut on December 9 in a nationally televised game against the San Diego Chargers, recording a memorably \"jarring\" tackle of Andre Coleman on a kick return. Drake played in two games as a rookie.\nDrake was allocated to the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (WLAF) in February 1996. He finished the 1996 WLAF season with a league-leading eight sacks. Drake re-joined the Cardinals for the 1996 season and recorded 14 tackles, mostly on special teams, in 11 games played.\nIn June 1997, Drake signed a three-year, $1.025 million extension with the Cardinals. However, after losing strength in the left side of his body, he was diagnosed with spinal cord compression and underwent a season-ending surgery on August 26, 1997. Drake was cleared for activity in April 1998. He earned the starting spot at defensive left end ahead of the 1998 season opener against the Dallas Cowboys, following an injury to Brad Ottis and a contract holdout by first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth. However, Drake developed a herniated disc in his back during the game and was forced to undergo surgery again, once again ending his season.\nAfter his release from prison in July 1999, Drake joined the Cardinals' training camp. In the 1999 season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles, he sacked Doug Pederson and recovered a fumble. However, Drake cracked a bone in his right thumb. In week three against the San Francisco 49ers, he intercepted a tipped pass from Steve Young. Drake started all 16 games and recorded 98 tackles. He signed a one-year extension in May 2000. Drake suffered a sprained right knee in a preseason loss to the Minnesota Vikings and was subsequently placed on the injured reserve list. He was released in early November after reaching an injury settlement.\nPersonal life.\nDrake got married shortly after the conclusion of the 1996 season. He was arrested twice in late 1997 and was charged with an aggravated Driving under the influence (DUI) felony in each instance. After pleading no contest to both charges, Drake was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of four and six months. His second child, a son, was born during his time in prison, and he was released in July 1999."

It was founded in 1909, and the championship golf course was designed by Alister MacKenzie.\nIn 1929, Moortown hosted the second Ryder Cup matches, the first to be played in Great Britain. About two thousand spectators saw America gain a narrow lead before the Great Britain team won singles on the final day and thus the competition by a score of 7–5 points.\nMoortown was a regular venue on the British PGA tournament circuit, which later became the European Tour, through to the mid-1980s, hosting the Yorkshire Evening News Tournament (19 times between 1925 and 1962), the Daily Telegraph Foursomes Tournament (1949), the Lotus Tournament (1950), the Silentnight Tournament (1965), the Tournament Players Championship (1980) and the Car Care Plan International (1984–1986). The club has also hosted qualifying rounds for The Open Championship as well as being the venue for the English Amateur four times, and the Brabazon Trophy on five occasions.\nHistory.\nPlans for the establishment of Moortown Golf Club were revealed in 1908. The Alister MacKenzie designed course, built on Black Moor, land that was leased from the Lane-Fox estate, partially opened the following year. Soon after, the full eighteen holes were open for play. Development of the course continued through into the 1930s, by which time MacKenzie's brother, Charles, was overseeing the work.\nThe official opening of Moortown was commemorated with a challenge match involving James Braid and Harry Vardon in September 1910; the event was originally planned for May but was postponed following the death of King Edward VII."

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Anderson is the last big league batter to lead either major league with fewer than 100 strikeouts (95 in 1958).\nAnderson attended West Nottingham Academy then West Chester University and was signed in by the Philadelphia Phillies. Anderson played 484 career games from 1957 to 1961, with the Phillies and Reds. Anderson's first two years in the Major Leagues were his finest. Playing as the Phils' regular left fielder with occasional appearances as a first baseman, Anderson finished in the Top 25 in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award in both and .\nDuring the 1958 campaign, in his sophomore season in Philadelphia, Anderson batted .301, with 23 home runs, and 97 runs batted in (RBI) — all career highs. But his performance went into decline in and in June the Phillies traded him to the Reds with Wally Post for outfielders Tony González, a rookie, and veteran Lee Walls. González would be the Phils' starting centerfielder for much of the 1960s. Anderson, meanwhile, continued to struggle in Cincinnati and was sent to the minor leagues during the May 1961 roster cutdown.\nOverall, Anderson recorded 419 career hits in 1,586 at bats with 199 runs, 82 doubles, 16 triples, 60 home runs, 242 RBI and 159 walks in the Major Leagues.\nIn 1992, Anderson was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. He suffered a fatal heart attack, at his home, in Greenville, Delaware, June 11, 1998, aged 66 years."

        "text": "John Michael Dorsey (born August 30, 1960) is an American football executive and former player who is a senior personnel executive for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as general manager of the Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs. He is a former National Football League player for the Green Bay Packers, and later served in the Packers' scouting department for more than two decades, including director of college scouting from 2000 to 2011. He served as the Seattle Seahawks' director of player personnel in 1999, between two stints in Green Bay's front office.\nCollege career.\nDorsey was a four-year starter at linebacker for the University of Connecticut Huskies, being twice named Yankee Conference Defensive Player of the Year as well as an NCAA Division I-AA All-American honors.\nProfessional career.\nDorsey was a fourth-round pick by the Green Bay Packers in the 1984 NFL draft. He was also seventh-round draft pick by the USFL's Philadelphia Stars in the 1984 USFL Draft. He played five seasons for Green Bay at linebacker and on special teams. His thirty-five special teams tackles for the Packers in 1984 is still a team record.\nDorsey spent the 1989 season on the injured reserve list after suffering a knee injury during pre-game warmups of the Packers regular season opener, effectively ending his playing days. He totaled 130 tackles and two fumble recoveries during his five-year career.\nAdministrative career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nAfter his playing career ended, Dorsey chose to remain in football, taking a job as a college scout for the Packers in May 1991. He was later promoted to director of college scouting for the team in February 1997.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nIn January 1999, Dorsey followed former Packers coach Mike Holmgren to the Seattle Seahawks, assuming the role of the team's director of player personnel. He resigned in 2000.\nSecond stint with the Packers.\nIn 2000, Dorsey returned to the Packers, taking over again as director of college scouting. He remained in that position through 2011, and winning a Super Bowl ring. In 2012, he was named director of football operations. He is credited with making the Packers one of the best drafting teams in the NFL, helping choose star players like Aaron Rodgers, Clay Matthews and Greg Jennings.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn January 13, 2013, Dorsey became the general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs. The move reunited Dorsey with new Chiefs head coach Andy Reid. The pair served on the Green Bay Packers coaching staff together from 1992 to 1997. It had previously been announced that Reid would have the final say in football matters when he came over from Philadelphia, but the Chiefs then announced that Dorsey would have the same authority over personnel as other NFL general managers. However, Dorsey and Reid reported on an equal basis to chairman and CEO Clark Hunt, unlike past years in which the coach reported to the general manager.\nWhile with Kansas City, Dorsey made the decision to trade up to draft Patrick Mahomes with the tenth selection in the 2017 NFL draft. This pick was criticized, as many commentators believed that Deshaun Watson was the better pick. Dorsey stood by the decision, saying about Mahomes \"these types of guys don't come around that often... I believe in his skillset, and what he's going to develop into.\" Mahomes would later help the Chiefs to three Super Bowl championships in five seasons.\nOn June 22, 2017, the Chiefs organization and Dorsey agreed to part ways, after posting a 43–21 record and three trips to the postseason in his four seasons as GM for the Chiefs. Shortly before leaving the Chiefs, former Chiefs wide receiver Jeremy Maclin said that Dorsey informed him of his release on a voicemail, which drew criticism from Maclin himself and the media.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn December 7, 2017, Dorsey became the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, hours after Sashi Brown was relieved of his duties; a press conference announcing Dorsey's hiring was held the following day with team owner Jimmy Haslam. Dorsey drafted quarterback Baker Mayfield (Oklahoma) with the 1st overall selection in the 2018 NFL draft, followed by cornerback Denzel Ward (Ohio State) with the 2018 4th overall selection, then running back Nick Chubb (Georgia) in the 2nd round, wide receiver Antonio Callaway (Florida) in the 4th round, and others. Dorsey also traded for star wide receiver Jarvis Landry, previously a member of the Miami Dolphins. After finishing 7-8-1 in the 2018 season and missing the playoffs, Dorsey went on to trade for star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (previously a teammate of Landry's at LSU), as well as acquiring other assets via trade and the draft (cornerback Greedy Williams, running back Kareem Hunt, defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, and defensive end Olivier Vernon).\nOn December 31, 2019, the Browns announced the departure of Dorsey.\nDetroit Lions.\nAfter consulting for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020, Dorsey was hired by the Detroit Lions as a senior personnel executive on January 27, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nDorsey is a son of former Maryland state senator Walter B. Dorsey and Jeanne Dorsey Mandel, who remarried in 1974 to Maryland Governor Marvin Mandel.\nDorsey attended and graduated from St. Mary's High School in Annapolis. He earned bachelor's degrees in Political Science and Economics from the University of Connecticut.\nDorsey has two adult sons from his first marriage and has a son and daughter with his current wife, Patricia. The couple first met in Kansas City while Dorsey was on a scouting trip for the Packers. After several years of dating, they were married in 2005.\nDorsey has competed in multiple marathon races and is an avid water skier."

        "title": "2006–07 Missouri Tigers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2006–07 Missouri Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Missouri in the 2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The season marked the first year of Mike Anderson's tenure.\nPre-season.\nMissouri returned just two starters from the 2005-06 team, which finished 11th in the Big 12 and 12-16 overall. Guard Jimmy McKinney and center Kevin Young graduated, and leading scorer Thomas Gardner left school for the professional ranks. The coaching turmoil involving Quin Snyder had defined the previous season; the Tigers controversially fired the head coach in February in the middle of a losing streak. Athletic director Mike Alden chose Mike Anderson from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, hiring him on March 26, 2006.\nAnderson promised to bring \"The Fastest Forty Minutes of Basketball\" to Columbia, a style of play modeled after Nolan Richardson's \"40 Minutes of Hell.\" However, Anderson's moniker did not become popular until a few seasons had passed.\nAnderson inherited seven players from Snyder's tenure. Junior Marshall Brown appeared to be a rising star after averaging almost double figures in scoring as a sophomore. Point guard Jason Horton, center Kalen Grimes and swingman Glen Dandridge—all of whom arrived in Columbia as a highly touted group of recruits—rounded out the junior class. Sophomore Leo Lyons returned as well, along with sophomore Matt Lawrence, who played sparingly as a freshman. The only senior on the squad was Marcus Watkins, son of assistant coach Melvin Watkins.\nAnderson's first recruiting class featured three junior college players in point guard Stefhon Hannah, forward Vaidatos Volkus and forward Darryl Butterfield. Hannah figured to star for Missouri right away; Anderson had plucked him away from Kansas State and Bob Huggins, who also heavily recruited him. Volkus was signed by Snyder's staff and retained by Anderson, and Butterfield was an obscure recruit from Mineral Area College. Anderson also brought in two freshmen: Keon Lawrence and J.T. Tiller. Lawrence was also a Snyder signee but stayed on because the school kept Watkins on staff. Tiller had committed to Anderson at UAB and followed him to MU.\nWith the program in turmoil and the loss of so many productive players from the previous team, the media picked Missouri to finish eighth in the Big 12.\nNon-Conference.\nMissouri did not have much difficulty in Mike Anderson's first three games as head coach, defeating North Carolina A&amp;T, Army and Stetson to capture the John Thompson Foundation Classic title. The Tigers, who did not play a road game until December, began 9–0, facing mostly inferior opponents. However, MU did actually defeat two eventual NCAA tournament squads during this stretch. On November 19, the Tigers overcome a modest five-point deficit in the second half to defeat Davidson, a team that wound up with a 13-seed in March. Freshman Stephen Curry, a future First-Team All-American and NBA Draft pick in 2009, played for the Wildcats and scored 16 points. A few weeks later on November 30, Missouri routed the University of Arkansas 86–64 in a nationally televised game. The Razorbacks—the program that employed Anderson for 17 seasons as an assistant and later hired him as head coach in 2011—turned the ball over 24 times, giving Anderson's frenetic style of play a signature win for the first time in Columbia. Due to one of the more significant snowfalls in mid-Missouri history, only 5,428 fans attended the game. The athletic department allowed the fans to fill the lower bowl, though, to compensate for a storm that forced MU to cancel classes the next day.\nMissouri's undefeated start ended when it played its first true road game in West Lafayette, Indiana. A Carl Landry-led Purdue team broke away in the second half to win 79–62. Less than two weeks later, Missouri dropped its second game of the season, a 73–70 loss to rival Illinois in the Braggin' Rights series. The loss marked the seventh straight loss in the series for the Tigers. In a back-and-forth game, Illinois held on for the victory after junior guard Stefhon Hannah fumbled the ball on the final possession and failed to get off a potential game-tying three-pointer.\nThe Tigers won their final two games of non-conference play, which included an 83–75 home win over Mississippi State. Ben Hansbrough, who later transferred to Notre Dame and earned Big East Player of the Year honors in 2011, scored eight points in that game for the Bulldogs.\nConference play.\nThe momentum of MU's surprising 11–2 start faded immediately, as the Tigers began Big 12 play with four straight losses. In Anderson's Big 12 debut, Iowa State overcame a 16-point second-half deficit to win on a last-second tip-in by Wesley Johnson. Keeping with the trend of undiscovered stars, Johnson is yet another Missouri opponent during the 2006–07 season that eventually reached stardom—Johnson transferred to Syracuse and won Big East Player of the Year honors in 2010 and was drafted fourth in the 2010 NBA draft. Four days later, a heavily favored Texas Longhorns team dominated Missouri in Austin, thanks to 34 points from Kevin Durant. Then, in the midst of another ice storm, Missouri dropped a home game to Kansas State. The Tigers nearly recovered from a 16-point hole in the second half, and trailed by just five points with less than a minute to play. However, with a chance to throw down a monstrous dunk in the open court, junior forward Marshall Brown missed the jam and killed any hope of a comeback. Two days after that loss, Missouri faced the rival Kansas Jayhawks in Lawrence in an ESPN \"Big Monday\" game on Martin Luther King Day. The underdog Tigers battled the 6th-ranked Jayhawks wire-to-wire, but sophomore Matt Lawrence's tying three-point attempt as time expired did not even catch the rim.\nAnderson won his first Big 12 game in Boulder, Colo., as the Tigers dominated the Buffaloes in a 14-point victory. MU returned home to defeat Bob Knight's Texas Tech team to draw to 2–4 in conference play, but it lost three of its next four games to fall to 3–7.\nThe Tigers worked their way back into post-season contention, though, with a three-game winning streak. First, Missouri edged Baylor by seven points on Valentine's Day. Three days later, Anderson won his first game against a ranked opponent by beating 18th-ranked Oklahoma State 75–64 at Gallagher-Iba Arena, a traditionally difficult Big 12 venue. Freshman guard Keon Lawrence led the team with 18 points, and even little-used reserve Glen Dandridge made a three-pointer and scored five points in four minutes of action. The next week, Lawrence—no relation to Matt Lawrence—continued his strong play and came up with one of the season's most exciting plays in a win over the Oklahoma Sooners. Lawrence made the game-winning basket with a turnaround jumper with less than a minute to play, despite not making a field goal in the first half.\nAt 6–7, the Tigers had finally worked their way into the NCAA tournament at-large conversation. Although experts said it was a pipe dream, Missouri appeared to have a very slim chance if it could win the remainder of its games and finish above .500 in the Big 12. Any talk of the NCAA Tournament ended after MU dropped an overtime game to the Nebraska Cornhuskers in Lincoln, though, a game dominated by Australian center Aleks Maric, who scored 31 points. Maric, who proved to be an extremely difficult match-up for the smaller Tigers during his career, made five free throws to seal the game in the final minute of overtime. Freshman J.T. Tiller missed a game-winning attempt at the end of regulation in that game, and the Tigers missed three shots from behind the arc with a chance to tie the game in OT.\nMissouri finished the conference season with a home win over Colorado on senior night, which honored lone senior Marcus Watkins, the son of assistant coach Melvin Watkins. The Tigers battled Texas A&amp;M to a tie at half-time in the Big 12 finale, but the Sweet 16-bound Aggies blew the game open in the second half for a comfortable win. That left MU with a 7–9 record and a sixth-place finish in the Big 12.\nBig 12 Tournament.\nMissouri drew 11th-seeded Baylor in the first round of the 2007 Big 12 Tournament, a game televised by ESPN2. The Bears entered the game with a 14–15 record but featured a young, talented backcourt—the same players who took the program to a surprising NCAA Tournament appearance just one year later. Baylor's talent was obvious on the court that night, and Scott Drew's team shocked Missouri with a 14-point win. The loss was considered embarrassing at the time for Anderson's program, which appeared to take a step back after a promising regular season. Anderson's vaunted pressing style did not fare well against Baylor, as it shot 63 percent from the field and burned Missouri's full-court pressure for 40 minutes.\nUpon elimination from the Big 12 Tournament, the Tigers clearly did not have the credentials for an NCAA Tournament at-large bid. However, with a 6th-place finish in a power conference and an 18-12 overall record, the Tigers appeared headed to at least the NIT. On March 12, 2007, though, the NIT did not select Missouri to participate, ending Anderson's first season as head coach.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=|Preseason\n!colspan=12 style=|Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Tournament "

        "title": "2. Rugby-Bundesliga",
        "text": "The 2. Rugby-Bundesliga is the second-highest level of Germany's Rugby union league system, organised by the German Rugby Federation. Its set below the Rugby-Bundesliga, the top-tier of German rugby, and above the Rugby-Regionalliga, the third tier.\nThe league was undergoing a major revamp for the 2012-13 season with the number of clubs expanded from 20 to 24 and the league divided into four regional divisions of six teams each. Above the 2nd Bundesliga the Bundesliga was organised in a similar fashion.\nHistory.\nThe Second Bundesligas were formed after the German reunion in the early 1990s, originally as four regional leagues, North, East, West and South. Later, the four leagues were merged to form two leagues, South/West and North/East. By 2017 the league structure had been again divided into four groups.\nSince 2002, the two champions of the leagues play a 2nd Bundesliga championship final which also determines the clubs promoted to the Bundesliga. \nThe bottom clubs in the league are relegated to the Rugby-Regionalliga, the third tier of rugby in Germany. The top-teams of the Regionalliga are promoted in turn.\nThe four groups cover the following states in 2017:\nIn the 2008-09 season, only nine of the sixteen German states have clubs at this level. Bremen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia and Saarland have no 2nd Bundesliga club.\nWith the RC Luxembourg, a team from Luxembourg, a non-German side competes in the league. The inclusion of this side in the 2009 promotion round to the 2nd Bundesliga caused some debate in regards to its legality, as the club had not qualified through the German league system and was not a member of any of the German regional rugby federations. However, RC Luxembourg's application was declared valid in regards to the German rugby federations rules and regulations and the team finished second in the promotion round, earning a place in the 2nd Bundesliga for 2009-10.\nAs a sign of the gap between the Bundesliga and the 2nd Bundesliga, TSV Victoria Linden, who only won the 2009-10 North/East division in the last round of the championship, declined promotion, citing the additional cost of travelling and the limited player pool as their reason. The South/West champion, Stuttgarter RC, has also indicated that it would not take up promotion, leaving the Bundesliga with only eight clubs for the next season. It also meant, for the first time ever, that no club from Hanover would compete at the top level of German rugby. \"DSV 78\" protested the decision to reduce the league to eight teams again and thereby relegating the club. For the 2nd Bundesliga, this also meant, only one team each would be promoted to the two regional divisions to keep the strength at ten teams per league. In the North/East, this was SC Siemensstadt, the club being directly promoted, while, in the South/West, TV Pforzheim won the promotion tournament of the five southern Regionalliga champions in Nuremberg on 12 June 2010.\nOn 22 August 2011, five days before the 2011-12 season start, the RG Heidelberg withdrew its reserve team from the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga South/West, citing inability to guarantee a full player squad for the whole season and thereby forcing the South/West division to compete with nine clubs only. The Berliner RC II withdrew during the season, also citing a lack of players as the reason while the RU Hohen Neuendorf was disqualified after not fielding a team in two league games.\nIn mid-July 2012 the \"Deutsche Rugby Tag\", the annual general meeting of the \"DRV\" decided to approve a league reform proposed by German international Manuel Wilhelm. The new system saw the number of clubs in the 2nd Bundesliga increased from 20 to 24 and the league divided into four regional divisions of six clubs each. One of the main aims of the reform was to reduce the number of kilometres travelled by individual teams and therefore reduce the travel expenses. The system will remain mostly unchanged for the 2013-14 season. The only changes will be a play-off between the fourth and fifth placed teams in each group after the first stage to determine the clubs advancing to the second stage. The championship play-offs after the second stage will be reduced from sixteen to twelve clubs with the top two teams in each group advancing directly to the quarter-finals while the remaining eight will play a wild card round to determine the other four quarter finalists.\nFrom 2015 onwards the Bundesliga was reduced to sixteen clubs while the 2. Bundesliga remains at twenty four, divided into four regional groups. The winners of these four divisions would play each other for two direct promotion spots to the Bundesliga while the two losers of these games would face the seventh placed clubs from the Bundesliga.\n2nd Bundesliga champions until 2001.\nBefore the establishment of the single-division Bundesliga, the two 2nd Bundesligas determined their champion in the autumn half of the season before splitting each division into two groups, the upper half playing for Bundesliga promotion together with the bottom clubs of the Bundesliga, and the lower half against 2nd Bundesliga relegation. Teams from the two regional divisions did not meet and now country-wide 2nd Bundesliga championship as such was played. The autumn champions were:\nPlacings in the 2nd Bundesliga since 2001.\nSince 1998, the following clubs have played in the league. From 1999 to 2001, the league consisted of two regional divisions of six teams each. After an autumn (A) round, the top three from each group would reach the championship finals round in spring (S). The bottom three, together with the top three from each of the two 2nd Bundesligas would play a promotion round in spring with the top three in each group playing in the Bundesliga the following autumn. In 1997-98 and from 2001 to 2012, the league has been played in a single-division format. From 2012–13 to 2014–15 it had been divided into a first (I) and second round (II), followed by play-offs:"

The Conference Champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup.\nThis was the first of the 25 consecutive years in which the Detroit Red Wings qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs until their streak finally ended in 2017. Their streak is tied for the third longest in NHL history, and while it was running, it was the longest active playoff appearance streak in the four major American professional sports.\nThe finals concluded on May 25 with the Pittsburgh Penguins winning the Stanley Cup, defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the final series four games to two. Pittsburgh forward Mario Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.\nThis was the first NHL playoffs without any series sweeps since the 1973 playoffs.

The playoffs concluded on May 25 with the champion Calgary Flames defeating the Montreal Canadiens 4–2 to win the Stanley Cup Finals four games to two.\nIt remains the last time that the Cup Finals was contested between two Canadian hockey teams. Montreal finished the regular season with 115 points, only two behind the league leader Calgary. They had last faced each other in 1986, with Montreal winning in five games. Calgary was only the second opposing team in NHL history to win a Stanley Cup at the Montreal Forum (the New York Rangers defeated the Montreal Maroons in 1928) and the first and only to do so against the Canadiens. Flames defenceman Al MacInnis won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, while Lanny McDonald, who ended the regular season with exactly 500 goals, got his name on the Cup in his last NHL game. Flames co-owner Sonia Scurfield became the first Canadian woman to have her name inscribed on the Stanley Cup.\nWayne Gretzky and the Los Angeles Kings met the defending champion Oilers in the first round. The Kings defeated the defending Stanley Cup champions after falling behind 3–1.

One round later, Mario Lemieux equaled four NHL-records (most goals in a game, most goals in a period, most points in a game, and most points in a period) by scoring five goals and eight points in a 10–7 Pittsburgh win in game five of the Patrick Division Finals. Hextall then made headlines in the Wales Conference Finals, attacking Montreal's Chris Chelios in the late stages of Game 6 as retribution for Chelios' unpenalized hit on Flyers forward Brian Propp in game one.

        "text": "Revolution (cycling series) – Season 5 is the a season of the series of track cycling events primarily held at the Manchester Velodrome in the north west of England\nSeason 5 (2007/2008).\nThe first Revolution event of the season was held in October 2007 with a brand new track surface, replaced over the summer after wearing out 17 years early because of heavy use. This season was going to be a vital one for the preparation of the British team. The series built up to the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester in March, followed by the Olympic Games in August. Competition for places in the successful squad was fierce, with performances at the Revolution events an important factor in the selection process. At the final event of the season, trials even took place to see who would be the lead off man for Team sprint squad. Jamie Staff performed best on the night and went on to take the place in the squad at the expense of Craig MacLean.\nSprint competition.\nAt the season opening Revolution 17 event top British riders Craig MacLean and Jamie Staff took on international visitors Itmar Estoban and Michael Blanchford. Also in the competition were younger British riders led by the rising star Jason Kenny. Maclean reached the final and came up against Kenny, in what proved to be a significant encounter. Kenny took the victory, a result which would signal the start of a changing of the guard in the sprint squad. In the Keirin race Staff took the victory, pipping Kenny on the line.\nRevolution 18 saw a junior sprint competition take place. In the Women's Omnium event, Great Britain took on a German team including Junior World Sprint Champion Kristina Vogel. The British team of Jess Varnish, Becky James and Laura Trott took overall. In the Men's competition the French and Germans provided the opposition. Peter Mitchell came up against Frenchman Charlie Conord in the final, with Conord powering to victory. The evening was rounded off with a Team Sprint event. The British development team were defeated by the Germans, while the main British team were narrowly beaten by the French.\nAn omnium sprint competition took place at Revolution 19, with reigning World Champion Theo Bos going up against the top British riders. The evening saw a truly dominant performance from Jason Kenny. The opening event saw Kenny set a new personal best time of 10.178 in the 200 Metre Time Trial, defeating World Champion and record holder Bos. He then went on to defeat all comers in the rounds of the sprint omnium. The only race Kenny did not win was the Keirin race at the end of the evening, which was won by Bos to savage some pride from the evening.\nIn the final event of the season, Revolution 20, Chris Hoy defeated his team mates and the French sprint squad to take victory in the Keirin. In the main sprint competition Ross Edgar defeated Jamie Staff in the final to take the victory. Elsewhere Victoria Pendleton took victory in the Women's competition.\nEndurance competition.\nCompetition was also strong in the endurance ranks. Established stars and Revolution regulars like Chris Newton, Mark Cavendish and Rob Hayles faced stiff competition from their young team mates and a host of international stars.\nAt the opening Revolution 17 event, the season got under way with a motor paced scratch race. Mark Cavendish make a move on the last lap to come around the outside of the field and take victory on the line from Geraint Thomas. In the Points Race a group of seven riders broke clear including Newton, Cavendish, Clancy and American Colby Pearce. The group gained a lap on the field, with the race coming down to a sprint between the seven. Peace was able to hit the line first, followed home be Clancy and Newton. The feature scratch race was a frantic affair, with four riders breaking away from the field. The smooth teamwork of Newton, David O'Loughlin, Mike Friedman and Magnus Bäckstedt allowed them to gain a lap on the field. The rest of the field were then withdrawn in the closing laps to allow the four to sprint it out for victory alone. Newton made no mistake and lead from the front to take a clear victory.\nRevolution 18 saw a strong field of riders, including Bradley Wiggins, Franco Marvulli and World Points Race Champion Joan Llaneras. Marvulli took the opening Motor Paced Scratch race, with Wiggins taking second place. Next up was the Scratch Race, which saw a break away gaining a lap featuring Wiggins, Llanearas, Newton and Ben Swift. Wiggins looked set to take victory in the sprint but just failed to get around young Swift who took the victory. The young British riders form continued as Peter Kennaugh, Johnny Bellis and Andy Tennant defeated their senior Spanish opponents in a Team Pursuit Challenge. A feature length Points Race rounded off the evening, with much expected of the big names in the field. However the likes of Wiggins and Llanearas and Marvulli did not have it their own way as they were not involved in the various break aways that took place. In the end Newton continued his resurrenge of form in the Points Race by taking victory from O'Loughlin and Toni Tauler.\nMark Cavendish returned at Revolution 19 to continue his build up to a busy road and track season in 2008. He made an early break for home in Motor Pace Scratch Race, however he could not hold off the charging Newton who took victory from Steven Burke. The Points Race was contested at the front by youngsters Kennaugh, Swift and Burke. Swift held the lead going until the final stages, until threatened by a late break by Kennaugh to take the final sprint. However Swift came home in fourth in the sprint to take the victory by one point. This trio then also dominated the closing stages of the Scratch race, freezing out the big guns like Newton. Burke took a close finish on the line to add to his National Scratch Race Title.\nIn the season finale it was an all team affair, with all the events competed in Madison pairings. The duo of Rob Hayles and Geraint Thomas took victory in the Elimination Scratch race. A unique team Points race also took place, with each rider of the duo competing half of the race before changing over with his team mate. Iljo Keisse and Dimitri DeFauw took victory in this fast paced event. In the feature Madison race the duos of Peter Schep and Jens Mouris and Great Britain's Rob Hayles and Geraint Thomas gained a lap and fought it out for the victory. Schrep finished ahead of Hayles in the final sprint to take the victory.\nIn the Madison Time Trial event, early season victories went to the teams of Mark Cavendish and Ed Clancy and Ben Swift and Jonathan Bellis. At Revolution 19 the duo of Steven Burke and Peter Kennaugh took the top spot. The competition at Revolution 20 was eagerly awaited as current record co-holder Arnaud Tournant was to team up with the legendary Chris Hoy to attempt to beat the record. News of Tournant's shoulder injury, making a proper hand sling changeover impossible, put their record attempt in doubt. However the crowd were on their feat as the duo set a new record with an awesome time of 54.5 seconds, which still stands today.\nFuture Stars series.\nIn the boys competition the stand out performer was Dan McLay, who finished some distance ahead of nearest rival Chris Whorral. In the girls competition it was closer at the top with Corinne Hall taking victory in the end over Hannah Manley."

        "title": "Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse",
        "text": "The Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse team represents the University of Maryland in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I lacrosse as a member of the Big Ten Conference. Maryland was a founding member of the Atlantic Coast Conference before withdrawing after the 2014 season.\nSince 1924, Maryland has secured numerous national championship honors, including four NCAA tournament championships, eight Wingate Memorial Trophy titles and one United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association championship. They have reached 28 NCAA tournament semi-finals since 1971. Maryland is the only major college lacrosse team to have never finished a season with a losing record. The team is currently coached by John Tillman.\nJohns Hopkins, located in nearby Baltimore, are considered the Terrapins' biggest rivals. The two schools have played more than 100 times since the series began in 1895, although Maryland does not officially recognize games that occurred prior to lacrosse becoming a varsity sport at Maryland in 1924. In 2015, the rivalry became a conference game, as Hopkins joined the Big Ten Conference as an associate member in lacrosse. The Terps have had the Blue Jays number since joining the Big Ten, boasting a 10-5 head to head record and having won 6 of 7 meetings dating from 2021-2023. Maryland holds a 3-0 record vs. Hopkins in the conference tournament during that time period as well. Other rivals include Virginia, Navy, Towson, and UMBC.\nHistory.\nThe Maryland program started as a club team in 1895. During its early years, Maryland teams competed against the best in lacrosse with games on record against Johns Hopkins, Penn State, Navy, Harvard, Cornell and others.\nThe team was elevated to varsity status in 1924. Since then, Maryland has never finished with a losing record, a feat unmatched by any other major college lacrosse team. The Terrapins have finished four seasons with a winning percentage of .500.\nUnder the guidance of coach R. V. Truitt, Maryland entered the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League (USILL) in 1924. In its first contest in the association, it snapped Navy's 46-game winning streak and then beat undefeated Johns Hopkins, the Southern Division championship team, 4–2. The following season, Maryland captured the Southern Division title by beating the Doug Turnbull-led Hopkins squad, 3–1.\nIn 1926, the USILL was succeeded by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA), which did not have a limitation on the number of member schools. For the next five decades, Maryland remained a national power, alongside Johns Hopkins, Navy, and St. John's. The dominance of these four schools located in the state of Maryland was due in large part to the high caliber of the sport at the interscholastic level. Lacrosse was the preeminent spring sport at the public Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and Baltimore City College, as well as the city's private high schools. The importance of lacrosse was magnified by the lack of any major professional teams in Baltimore until the creation of the Colts in 1947 and the return of the Orioles in 1954.\nMaryland finished the 1928 season with a 9–1 record, the loss coming at the hands of Johns Hopkins. Three other association members finished with one loss: Hopkins, Navy, and Rutgers. The four squads were awarded Gold Medals as the best teams in the nation. That year, arrangements were made for the inclusion of a lacrosse exhibition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. American Olympic Committee president General Douglas MacArthur established a committee to organize the country's participation in the lacrosse event. Representation of the United States was determined by a tournament of intercollegiate and amateur teams that involved Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Rutgers, Army, Navy, and the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club. Maryland advanced to the final, where they were defeated by Hopkins in front of 15,000 spectators. In 1929, the undefeated St. John's Johnnies handed Maryland its first homefield loss in thirteen years.\nBefore the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, lacrosse proponents arranged for another exhibition tournament. To decide the representative for the United States, the American Olympic Lacrosse Committee held an eight-team single-elimination tournament featuring Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Syracuse, St. John's, Rutgers, Crescent Athletic Club, Mount Washington Lacrosse Club, and an all-star team composed of American Indian players from the Six Nations. Maryland defeated Mount Washington at Baltimore Stadium in front of 6,000 spectators in a doubleheader that also featured Johns Hopkins narrowly beat St. John's. In the semifinals, a small crowd of 500 watched Maryland beat the Crescents and Hopkins beat Rutgers in foul rainy weather. Hopkins defeated Maryland in the final before a crowd of 5,000 to secure their place as the United States representatives for the Olympics.\nIn 1936, Maryland coach Jack Faber guided the undefeated Terps to secure the inaugural Wingate Memorial Trophy, awarded to the USILA champions. The next year, Maryland finished undefeated again and shared the national co-championship with William F. Logan's Princeton. Faber led Maryland to back-to-back outright USILA titles in 1939 led by Jim Meade and Rip Hewitt, and in 1940 led by Milton Mulitz and Oscar Nevares.\nIn 1955 and 1956, co-head coaches Faber and Al Heagy guided the Terrapins to two more undefeated seasons and consecutive national championships. Maryland split the USILA championship with two other one-loss teams, Army and Johns Hopkins, in 1959.\nIn 1967, Maryland suffered one loss to Navy, that decade's dominant team, but Hopkins in turn defeated the Midshipmen which resulted in a three-way tie for the championship between the trio.\nOn March 29, 2009, the Maryland–Virginia regular season match resulted in the longest lacrosse game in NCAA history, extending into seven overtime periods. An unintentional whistle by the officiating staff negated what would have been a game-winning goal by Terrapins attackman Grant Catalino in the first overtime. Virginia went on to win with a goal in the seventh overtime, 10–9, and preserved its perfect record, 11–0, while Maryland slid to 6–3.\nIn 2011, Maryland defeated first-seeded Duke to recapture the ACC tournament championship after a six-year hiatus. Attackman Grant Catalino was named the tournament MVP.\nOn May 29, 2017, Maryland defeated 3rd-seeded Ohio State to win its third NCAA national championship (12th overall) and end the national title drought that began after its last championship in 1975.\nOn May 30, 2022, Maryland defeated 7th-seeded Cornell to win its fourth NCAA national championship (13th overall). Finishing the season at 18-0, the Terrapins became the third undefeated champions since the NCAA tournament expanded to 16 teams and the first since 2006.\nPlayers.\nSince 1922, a total of 124 first-team All-American honors have been bestowed upon Maryland players. Six Terrapins have received All-American honors each of their four years: Charles Wicker (1953–56), Frank Urso (1973–76), Bob Ott (1976–79), Bob Boniello (1977-80), Peter Worstell (1977–81), and Joe Walters (2003-2008). Frank Urso is one of just four college men's lacrosse players to be named a first-team All-American all four years.\nIn 2017, Matt Rambo was the first Maryland men's player to receive the Tewaaraton Award for the best men's collegiate lacrosse player in the country. In 2021, Jared Bernhardt became the second Maryland men's player to win the award. In 2022, Logan Wisnauskas became the third Maryland men's player to win the award.\nChampionships.\nNational championships.\nStarting in 1926, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) began rating college lacrosse teams and awarding gold medals to the top teams. Maryland was the recipient of one of these in 1928, alongside Johns Hopkins, Navy, and Rutgers, all of whom suffered just one regular season collegiate defeat. From 1936, the USILA awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the regular season intercollegiate champions. In 1971, the National Collegiate Athletic Association began hosting a men's lacrosse tournament to determine the national champions.\nConference tournament championships.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference has held a men's lacrosse tournament since 1989. The Big Ten Conference began hosting a men's lacrosse tournament in 2015.\nSeason results.\nThe following is a list of Marylands's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

Hunt played all 16 games in his rookie season, but began to suffer from the effects of head and neck injuries. He appeared in only three games in 1979, when he was forced to the injured reserve list because of knee surgery, and three more in 1980. On September 21, 1980, Hunt was kneed in the head during a game against the Los Angeles Rams and suffered a concussion. As a result of these injuries, this was to be his final NFL game. After spending 1981 on the reserve-retired list, Hunt attempted a comeback in the 1982 preseason, but was forced to retire on August 3, 1982 because of recurring concussions. His name has also been synonymous with a raunchy pun."

        "title": "List of Daytona 500 pole position winners",
        "text": "Daytona 500 pole position winners for the NASCAR Cup Series's Daytona 500 are rewarded with being the driver to lead the field across the start line at the beginning of the 200-lap race. Pole qualifying for the Daytona 500 is held one weekend before the race at the Daytona International Speedway. The driver to complete the fastest single lap in the final of three rounds in the knockout qualifying session around the high-banked tri-oval superspeedway earns the pole position. The first Daytona 500 was held in 1959 and in 1982, it became the opening event for the NASCAR Cup season. The term \"pole position\" was originally coined in the American horse racing industry, and indicated the position of the starter being next to the \"poles\", which established the boundaries of the course. As of the 2024, under the Race Team Alliance charter system, the 36 chartered cars are guaranteed entry for the race, with the four remaining spots being taken up by non-chartered teams (assuming four non-charted cars enter the race). The two drivers wiith the fastest qualifying lap in qualifying are awarded the first and second starting positions for the Daytona 500 and the two non-charter teams with the fastest qualifying lap are given entry for race. The other positions for the race are determined by the Daytona Duels with the 2 highest finishing non-chater teams in the duels also qualifying for the race. \nBill Elliott set the pole position qualifying record on February 9, 1987, when he navigated around the circuit with a 42.782-second lap, which is an average speed of . From 1988 to 2018, NASCAR required teams to install a restrictor plate between the throttle body and the engine. This rule was enacted as an effort to slow the cars speed in response to an accident in which fans suffered minor injuries when Bobby Allison's car blew a tire and crashed at over during a race at Talladega Superspeedway in 1987. Depending upon the sponsor, era, or a specific year, the qualifying races have been referred to as the \"Duels\" or the \"Twins\".\nProcedure.\nThe qualifying session for pole position is held before the Daytona 500. Drivers take one timed lap to determine their time. The fastest qualifier takes the pole position for the Daytona 500 and starts on the inside of the first row; the second fastest starts alongside him on the outside, referred to as the \"outside pole.\" Both front row starters are locked into these starting positions.\nThe 2015 race used the standard knockout qualifying system. Up to the 2014 race, drivers took two timed laps, and the better of the two timed laps was the driver's lap for purposes of Daytona 500 qualifying. Until 2001, NASCAR offered a second (and at times, a third) round of qualifying for teams who wished to improve their qualifying times. Drivers and teams decided if they were content with their first attempt, and \"stood on their time\", or if they wanted to improve their chances by attempting a \"second-round qualifying\" attempt. If satisfied with the original attempt, the team was required to notify NASCAR within five minutes of the final practice sessions, and before the beginning of the \"second-round qualifying\" attempts. Drivers who made second-round attempts started behind first-round only drivers; however, the qualifying times were crucial, since it determined a driver's fall back time should he fail to finish in the top 14 of the qualifying races. The strategy was usually done by drivers whose times would not make the race or be on the bubble. The second round of qualifying ended in 2001.\nThe two fastest drivers in the final qualifying session (the Daytona 500 pole winner and the \"outside\" pole winner) only are also awarded the pole positions for the two qualifying races held the following Thursday. Drivers are ranked by the furthest number of rounds advanced in qualifying, and then their qualifying time in the final round that they reached. Those who rank with an odd-numbered position are assigned to the first qualifying race, and those with an even-numbered rank to the second race. Cars in the final round of qualifying start the race in the front. The starting spots for the third through 32nd positions are determined by the drivers' finishing position in the qualifying races, with only the top 15 drivers' results, excluding the pole sitter in each race, advancing to the feature. Since 2005, each of the two qualifying races is long, or 60 laps. From its inception in 1959 until 1967, it was 40 laps, and from 1969 to 2004 it was 50 laps. After the races, prior to establishment of the Race Team Alliance charter system, the top four drivers in speed of those that failed to advance through the qualifying race are positioned in positions 33–36. The speeds used for this does not reflect their official qualifying times; regardless of which qualifying round they reached, their time used is the fastest time set in any round (first, second, or third), and does not reflect their starting position in the Duels. Positions 37-42 will go to the top six teams (not drivers) in points from the previous year's owners (team) points standings of teams not already qualified, again with their positions based on speed, again based on the fastest time in any round, not in the final round that they reached. The final starting position in the Daytona 500 (43rd overall) is reserved by NASCAR to allow one former NASCAR champion to start the race under the \"champion's provisional\" rule. Also known as the \"Petty Rule\", this rule was established in 1989 when NASCAR's winningest driver (Richard Petty) failed to qualify for an event at Richmond International Raceway. If the Champion's Provisional is not necessary, the seventh-highest team in the previous year's points advances, and positions 37-43 are positioned based on speed from their fastest round of qualifying.\nFrom 2005 until 2012, NASCAR adopted an \"All Exempt Tour\" format similar to golf. The teams in the top 35 of owner points (resulting in alternate nickname of \"Top 35 Rule\") during the previous season would be eligible to run in the Daytona 500, regardless of qualifying speed. The qualifying races now determine the relative starting position for these 35 drivers plus the starting positions for an additional seven to eight teams. The top 35 drivers, plus two non-top 35 drivers from each qualifier, start in the first 39 positions of the 500. The 40th, 41st, and 42nd starting positions are given to the fastest three non-exempt cars based on qualifying speed, which have not already qualified. The 43rd starting position is awarded to the most recent previous NASCAR champion who attempted to qualify; it is given to the fastest car that hadn't qualified if all previous champions qualified into the field. In 2008, the qualifying competition became known as the \"Coors Light Pole\" when Coors replaced Budweiser as the primary sponsor. Budweiser's parent company, Anheuser Busch Corporation, had been sponsoring the award since 1979, and would return in that role midway during the 2018 season after Coors did not renew their agreement as the Pole Award sponsor.\nUnder the current charter system, all chartered teams (maximum of 36) are guaranteed entry to the race, meaning the races only set the inside and outside starting positions for those teams. Each race's top finishing unchartered team advances to the Daytona 500, as well as two fastest \"open\" (non-charter) in the qualifying time trials for the last two starting grid slots (next fastest, if the fastest \"open\" car in the time trials was also the top \"open\" car in the Duel), for a total of four \"open\" cars and 40 overall cars on the grid.\nHistory.\nIn early years, qualifying had varying formats: from one timed lap, to the average of two laps, to the better of two laps. The idea of having two individual races to establish the starting lineup of the Daytona 500 dates back to the first race in 1959. That event, advertised as \"the 500 Mile NASCAR International Sweepstakes\", featured cars from NASCAR's Grand National division racing against cars in the Convertible division. The first of the qualifying races consisted of Convertible division cars and the second of Grand National cars. Shorty Rollins won the 100-mile Convertible race to become the track's first winner. When the green flag was thrown on the first Daytona 500, 59 cars raced to the starting line; the event was held without a caution period during the entire race. In 1960 (incidentally, the first ever national telecast of a NASCAR race), the last chance race was eliminated; from 1960 through 1967 the qualifying events were in length. When the season opened in 1968, the qualifying races were increased to , which meant the drivers would have to make at least one pit-stop to refuel (though the races were not held because of weather in 1968). Prior to 1971, the qualifying races yielded points to the drivers' championship.\nThe reduction in speed for the 1971 qualification was a result of NASCAR's effort to limit the increasing speeds achieved through the late 1960s and early 1970s. Engine size and technology, along with increased aerodynamic styling changes, brought speeds to over at some of the larger superspeedways. In an effort to reduce the escalating costs of developing faster racing equipment, increased horsepower, and the lack of parity in competition, NASCAR implemented several restrictions for the 1971 season, attempting to reduce speed by two methods. It experimented with restrictor plates for the first time at Michigan in August 1970. At the beginning of the 1971 season, NASCAR limited an engine's cubic inch displacement. The reductions had the effect of reducing costs for teams, but also limiting the horsepower and top speeds of NASCAR teams. At the time, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. stated:\nCorporate sponsors purchased naming rights to qualifying races; between 1982 and 1984, Uno cards was the title sponsor for the \"Uno Twin 125's\" qualifying events. In 1985 they became known as \"7-Eleven Twin 125's\"; no sponsors funded the 1988 and 1989 qualifying events and the races were called \"Daytona Twin Qualifiers\". Gatorade became the sponsor of the dual qualifying events in 1991. In 2005, the event was increased , and became known as the \"Gatorade Duels\" until 2015. Starting in 2016 CanAm took over sponsorship of the races, followed by Gander RV in 2019 and Bluegreen Vacations since 2020.\nSince the restrictor plate era began in 1988 until 2014, qualifying was the better single lap of two; drivers are permitted one warm-up lap followed by two consecutive timed laps. Since restrictor plate cars require more time to accelerate to full speed, drivers often consider their first timed lap a \"throwaway lap,\" and use it essentially as a second warm-up lap; and the second timed lap is usually the fastest of the three laps.\nIn August 2009, NASCAR announced that it would reschedule the 2010 opening round of qualifying to avoid a conflict with the NFL Super Bowl. The events that determine the top two starters for the Daytona 500 were rescheduled after the NFL moved the Super Bowl day one week to February 7, 2010. Qualifying had originally been scheduled for February 7, but NASCAR moved the date back to Saturday, February 6, to avoid conflict with the NFL. Daytona Speedway president, Robin Braig, stated:\nIn 2014, NASCAR adopted, starting with the second race of the year in Phoenix, a Formula One-style knockout qualifying system. After tweaking it in the 2014 GEICO 500 at Talladega, the format became three five-minute rounds, with the first round being split as two five-minute rounds with half the field in each round. As is the case for standard knockout qualifying, the top 24 advanced to the second round, and the top 12 advancing to the final round. This format was used at the Daytona 500 for the first time in 2015, but was soon abandoned for restrictor plate races after a series of incidents taking place during qualifying.\nRestrictor plate races eventually gets a new two-round qualifying format starting from the first Talladega race. In round 1, each car goes out one at a time for one warm-up, one timed, and one cool down lap. The order for the cars released was determined by a random draw. NASCAR will release the next car to begin their lap while the current car is finishing their timed lap with the goal to have the next car start their timed lap no more than 20 seconds after the previous car finishes. The top 12 cars from round 1 will make a second run in the same format to determine the starting lineup for positions 1–12, with the order of cars released are the invert of round 1 result (i.e. the 12th placed car will be released first). Positions 13th and below are determined by round 1 result.\nTelevision broadcasts.\nThe very first NASCAR races to ever be shown on television were broadcast by CBS. In February 1960, CBS sent a \"skeleton\" production crew to Daytona Beach, Florida and the Daytona International Speedway to cover the Daytona 500's Twin 100 qualifying races on February 12, 1960. The production crew also stayed to broadcast portions of the Daytona 500 itself, two days later. The event was hosted by John S. Palmer. CBS would continue to broadcast portions of races for the next 18 years, along with ABC and NBC."

        "title": "Fast5 Netball World Series",
        "text": "The Fast5 Netball World Series is an annual international Fast5 netball competition. The competition, which began in October 2009, features modified Fast5 rules, and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. The competition is contested by the six top national netball teams in the world, according to the INF World Rankings.\nBackground.\nBefore 2008, the major competitions in international netball were the quadrennial Netball World Championships (renamed Netball World Cup in 2015) and the netball event of the quadrennial Commonwealth Games. First-tier national teams also participated in yearly test series, with others playing in regional events. However, several significant changes in international netball occurred in 2008. Changes to international test rules were finalised at a World Netball (WN) congress in Auckland in 2007, and progressively rolled out across netball-playing countries the following year. WN also introduced a new world rankings system to compare the performances of national teams. In England, a campaign was started advocating netball's inclusion in the Olympic Games, as a demonstration sport in 2012 and potentially as a competitive sport from 2016. In the Southern Hemisphere, the sport attained semi-professional status in Australia and New Zealand with the introduction of the ANZ Championship.\nAlso, in December 2008 a new international netball competition was announced, the World Netball Series, to be contested in 2009 under modified rules. The new rules had been trialed by England junior and senior squads over a 12-month period. DVDs were sent to coaches of the participating teams for consultation. Some of the new rules were announced in December 2008, including six-minute playing quarters and power plays; others were announced in February 2009.\nPrior to the 2012 edition the rules were revamped and renamed Fast5.\nFormat.\nThe competition is held over two days, and is played under Fast5 rules. Each team plays each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams from this stage progress to the finals, played on the final day of competition, in which the 1st-ranked team plays the 4th-ranked team, while 2nd plays 3rd. The winners of these two matches contest the Grand Final; the remaining teams contest the third- and fifth-place playoffs.\nVenues.\nThe first three editions of the tournament were held in England. Initially, Manchester was to host all three seasons in England at the MEN Arena. The venue is the largest indoor arena in Europe, capable of seating around 20,000 spectators. However, the 2010 tournament was held in Liverpool at the Echo Arena, as was the 2011 tournament.\nOrganization.\nThe World Netball Series is organized by a local organizing committee and overseen by World Netball, in conjunction with the national governing bodies of the six competing nations each year.\nReception.\nAustralian coach Norma Plummer greeted the new tournament positively: \"If you want your sport to keep growing these days, it's got to become up with the times and keep having innovations that make the game exciting for not only the players, but all the spectators.\" But Plummer also expressed some reservations about power plays being used against substantially weaker teams, and also about penalty shootouts and the new centre pass rule.\nNetball New Zealand (NNZ) Chief Executive Raelene Castle stated that she was \"excited about what the new competition could bring to the ever-increasing profile of Netball internationally\". However, Castle also acknowledged that the shortened version of the game \"may not be for everyone\". New Zealand netball and basketball player Donna Wilkins also stated her concerns about the sport becoming too similar to basketball."

        "text": "These are the official results of the men's 5000 metres event at the 1983 IAAF World Championships in Helsinki, Finland. There were a total of 39 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats, two semi-finals and the final held on Sunday 14 August 1983.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nResults.\nQualifying heats.\nThe qualifying heats took place on 10 August, with the 39 athletes involved being split into 3 heats. The first 8 athletes in each heat ( Q ) and the next 6 fastest ( q ) qualified for the semifinals. \nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals took place on 12 August, with the 30 athletes involved being splitted into 2 heats. The first 5 athletes in each heat ( Q ) and the next 5 fastest ( q ) qualified for the final. \nFinal.\nAs in most other major international championships, also this 5,000-metre final was mostly slow and tactical. The Soviet Union's Anatoliy Krokhmaliuk led at 1,000 metres in 2:43.30. During the second kilometre, he and his team mate Dmitriy Dmitriyev alternated in the lead, with Dmitriyev clocking 5:34.15 at 2,000 metres. One lap later, Britain's Julian Goater suddenly accelerated, but over 200 metres after the start of his surge, Dmitriyev caught him. Soon thereafter, Dmitriyev again took the lead, and clocked 8:19.52 at 3,000 metres. During the fourth kilometre, Dmitriyev, Ethiopia's Wodajo Bulti, and Switzerland's Markus Ryffel took turns leading the race. With over three laps left, Krokhmaliuk dropped from the lead group. Bulti took the lead for the second and the last time just before 4,000 metres, which he passed in 11:03.27. At the start of the third-last home straight, Dmitriyev accelerated past Bulti. West Germany's Thomas Wessinghage and Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan positioned themselves behind Dmitriyev and Bulti. With two laps left, twelve men were still in the lead group, with Goater and Italy's Salvatore Antibo having dropped from Dmitriyev's pace. On the second-last back straight, the Soviet Union's Valeriy Abramov lost contact with the lead group. Dmitriyev launched his final kick's decisive stage at 4,400 metres. Immediately Ryffel, Portugal's Antonio Leitao, and Austria's Dietmar Millonig dropped from Dmitriyev's pace. At the start of the second-last home straight, Dmitriyev was already sprinting about five metres ahead of Bulti. Later on that home straight, Wessinghage and Coghlan kicked past Bulti, and Coghlan passed Wessinghage. At 4,600 metres, Dmitriyev led in about 12:30. In other words, he had sprinted the second-last lap in about 57 seconds! Coghlan was running about six or seven metres behind this Soviet runner, with Wessinghage, Bulti, Finland's Martti Vainio, the United States' Doug Padilla, East Germany's Werner Schildhauer, and Kenya's Paul Kipkoech still in the lead group. To the surprise of many spectators, Wessinghage dropped from Coghlan's pace on the final lap's front bend. This astonishing event - Wessinghage was a world-class runner at both 1,500 and 5,000 metres - probably inspired Vainio to start his final kick, and to pass Bulti. Further back, Kipkoech dropped from Padilla's and Schildhauer's pace. Early on the final back straight, Coghlan easily caught the tiring Dmitriyev. Vainio kicked past the exhausted Wessinghage. At 4,800 metres, Dmitriyev and Coghlan were running about nine metres ahead of Vainio. On the final bend, Schildhauer passed Padilla and Wessinghage, and dashed after Vainio. Coghlan triumphantly raised his right hand, glanced at the worn out Dmitriyev, and then began his final sprint. By the start of the home straight, Coghlan had already stretched his lead over Dmitriyev to four metres. Vainio was sprinting ten metres behind the Irishman, while Schildhauer was kicking a couple of metres behind the Finn. On the final home straight, without even sprinting as fast as he could, Coghlan moved into a wide lead, crossing the finish line in 13:28.53. In other words, he had run the final 1,000 metres in 2:24.77! Schildhauer passed Vainio with about 25 metres left, and caught Dmitriyev over 10 metres later. The exhausted Soviet runner was no match for the fast-finishing East German. Vainio leaned forward, and lunged across the finish line, crossing it just 0.04 seconds before Dmitriyev. Two of the strongest pre-race favourites, Padilla and Wessinghage, had to settle for the fifth and sixth places, respectively.

        "title": "Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union is one of Australia's oldest rugby union organisations, with a history dating back to the mid 19th century. The union is based in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.\nHistory.\nThe earliest report of a football match in Newcastle was in 1860, when \"'a lover of the old English games has offered one of Mrs. O’Hagan's most fashionable bonnets as a prize to the fortunate party who shall give the winning (final) kick in a game of foot-ball, to be played on the new cricket ground, near St. John's Church\"'. On 5 June 1869, the Volunteer Artillery team (8 players) challenged United Cricket Club (11 Players) to a football match. The game was played over two weekends in Centennial Park (currently Lowlands Bowling Club). The first recorded football club playing to the 'rugby rules' in the district was the Albion Football Club, established in 1872 in West Maitland. On 1 May 1877, a meeting at 'Ship Inn' saw the foundation of Newcastle Football Club. 1877 also saw the formation of the Wallsend Club.\nA precursor to the formation of a local union, the Raysmith Challenge Cup was commenced in 1887 and was contested by Newcastle, Waratah, Advance, Orientals, Union, Ferndale, West Maitland, Raymond Terrace, East Maitland Imperial, Singleton and East Maitland clubs. In 1888, a meeting of Newcastle, Advance, West Maitland, Union and Ferndale Clubs saw a branch of the Southern Rugby Football (later NSWRU in 1892) established, this was known as the Northern Branch. This was the formation of what would become the Newcastle Rugby Union. Early clubs in the competition included Advance (1880); West Maitland (1885); Oriental (1885); Union (1885); Ferndale (1885); Waratah (1885); Raymond Terrace (1886); Carlton (1887); Centennial (1887); Lambton (1888); Wickham Albion (1888) and Greta (1890).\nIn 1911, the Northern Branch disbanded but was reformed in 1912 to be known as the Newcastle Rugby Union. During 1915–1924, little rugby was played due to World War I and its aftermath. After a match between Great Public Schools Old Boys and Newcastle High School Old Boys at Empire Park in 1924, a decision was made to reform the Newcastle Rugby Union; this was beginning of the current Premier Rugby Competition. The 1925 competition comprised Cook's Hill Old Boys, Newcastle High School Old Boys, Great Public Schools' Old Boys \"(later re-named Wanderers),\" Lysaght's Limited, Northern Suburbs and Mayfield.\nDiscontent with the focus of district rugby \"(introduced in 1899)\" saw the establishment of the Hunter District Rugby Union in 1900. The initial competition comprised the East End, West End, Morpeth, Millers Forest, Branxton and Singleton clubs. Seniors competition continued until 1916, when suspended due to a shortage of players as a result of the War. But the HDRU continued to foster rugby football through the Cadets Competition. In 1996, the Hunter Valley Zone amalgamated with Newcastle to form the current Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union.\nList of clubs.\nLower-grade clubs.\nMedowie Marauders\nCurrent club details.\nThe Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union now consists of 20 clubs across 3 Divisions plus a women's competition.

        "text": "The 1988 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL), began on April 6, after the conclusion of the 1987–88 NHL season. It concluded on May 26, with the defending champion Edmonton Oilers defeating the Boston Bruins to win their second straight Stanley Cup and fourth in five years.\nThe Presidents' Trophy winning Calgary Flames had home ice advantage during the playoffs thanks in part to Edmonton's struggles without Wayne Gretzky, who missed 16 games due to injury. The Oilers, who had won the Cup in three of the previous four seasons, were still thought to have a good chance at repeating with Gretzky's return. The clash between the Flames and Oilers in the Smythe Division Final was highly anticipated.\nThe New Jersey Devils made the playoffs for the first time since their move from Denver, winning in overtime at Chicago Stadium on the season's final day to edge the New York Rangers for the Patrick Division's fourth spot. This was only the second time they made the playoffs including their Colorado and Kansas City days.\nThe 1988 playoffs most notable moment was the cancellation of game four of the finals in Boston after fog issues, a result of high heat and the subsequent building power outage resulted in the game being canceled outright with the result not counting, yet the league retained player stats from the game. The series would move directly on to Edmonton. Gretzky would go on to set NHL playoff records with 31 assists in 18 games and 13 points in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A4) Hartford Whalers.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams. Montreal won both previous meetings, including their most recent meeting in seven games in the 1986 Adams Division Finals.\nMontreal was the best team in the Wales Conference during the regular season.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs (A3) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams. Boston won both prior meetings. They last met in the 1983 Adams Division Finals, in which Boston won in seven games.\n(P1) New York Islanders vs. (P4) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. This was the first time that a team representing the state of New Jersey qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. This was the first ever playoff series victory for the Scouts/Rockies/Devils franchise. This would be the last playoff series until the 2019 Eastern Conference First Round that the Islanders held home-ice advantage.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. Washington won the only previous meeting in a three-game sweep in the 1984 Patrick Division Semifinals.\nWashington overcame a 3–1 series deficit to advance to the Patrick Division Finals for the third time in five years. Game seven ended when Dale Hunter scored at 5:57 of the first overtime period to complete the Capitals' comeback.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (N4) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThis was the 22nd playoff series between these two teams. Toronto led 11–10 in previous playoff meetings. This was a rematch of the previous year's Norris Division Finals, which Detroit won in seven games.\nGame six in Maple Leaf Gardens was future Hall of Famer Borje Salming's final playoff game in the NHL.\n(N2) St. Louis Blues vs. (N3) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThis was the fifth playoff series between the Blackhawks and Blues. Chicago won all four previous meetings, including their most recent meeting 3–1 in the 1983 Norris Division Semifinals.\n(S1) Calgary Flames vs. (S4) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams, but the first since the Flames relocated from Atlanta. Los Angeles won both previous meetings, including their most recent meeting 2–1 in the 1977 Preliminary Round.\n(S2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S3) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the fifth playoff series between the Jets and Oilers. Edmonton won all four previous meetings. This was a rematch of the previous year's Smythe Division Finals, which Edmonton won in a four-game sweep.\nDivision finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A2) Boston Bruins.\nThis was the 23rd playoff series between these two teams. Montreal led 20–2 in previous playoff series meetings. This was the fifth year in a row that these team met in the playoffs. Montreal had defeated Boston in the Division Semifinals the four previous seasons.\nThis was Boston's first playoff series victory against Montreal since the 1943 Stanley Cup Semifinals. Boston had lost the previous 18 playoff series between these two teams, an NHL record for most consecutive playoff series defeats to one team. This was the first of three consecutive series between these two teams that ended in five games (with the winner of all three series making it to the Stanley Cup Finals).\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P4) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams.\nPatrik Sundstrom's eight-point effort in game three (3 goals, 5 assists) set a new Stanley Cup playoff record for most points in a single game.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (N2) St. Louis Blues.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. St. Louis won the only previous meeting 3–1 in the 1984 Norris Division Semifinals.\n(S1) Calgary Flames vs. (S2) Edmonton Oilers.\nThis was the fourth playoff series meeting between these two teams. Edmonton won two of the previous three meetings. Calgary won the most recent meeting in seven games in the 1986 Smythe Division Finals.\nIn the Battle of Alberta the Oilers would claim the first sweep of the playoffs. In game two Wayne Gretzky scored the overtime winning goal short-handed.\nConference finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (P4) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\nThis series featured the infamous confrontation between Devils coach Jim Schoenfeld and referee Don Koharski after Game 3, when, during an argument in the tunnel after the game, Koharski tripped and fell, accusing Schoenfield of pushing him. Schoenfield famously responded, \"Good, 'cause you fell you fat pig!\" Then, he yelled \"Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!\" The incident has since become part of NHL lore.\nSchoenfeld was suspended by NHL president John Ziegler for Game 4, but the Devils received an injunction from the New Jersey Supreme Court, allowing Schoenfeld to coach the fourth game. In protest, the officials scheduled to work that game in the Meadlowands refused to take the ice, forcing the NHL to scramble for amateur officials to call the game. The injunction was lifted, the league conducted a proper hearing, Schoenfeld served his suspension during Game 5 in the Boston Garden, and the League officials returned to work.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(S2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N1) Detroit Red Wings.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams and was a rematch of the previous year's Clarence Campbell Conference Final which Edmonton won in five games.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first Finals meeting between these two teams.\nThe original Game 4 is well known for the high heat resulting in fog that interfered with the game and a subsequent power outage that caused the game to be canceled at 16:37 of the second period. The game results didn't count, but players were able to retain their stats counting towards their playoff records, as per NHL rules. The series moved on to Edmonton, thus allowing the Oilers to win the Cup at home at Northlands Coliseum and complete the four game sweep.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "text": "Thomas Leighton Edwards (December 12, 1899 – January 28, 1980) was an American football player. He played college football at the University of Michigan, where he was an All-American tackle for the Michigan Wolverines. Edward played professional football for one season, in 1926, with the New York Yankees of the American Football League and the Detroit Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).\nYouth.\nA native of Traverse City, Michigan, Edwards was a second generation Wolverine football player. His father, Randolph Thomas Edwards (known as R.T.), was a rusher for the 1879 Michigan Wolverines football team, the first intercollegiate football squad to represent the University of Michigan. His grandparents, Thomas Edwards and Elizabeth Harriet, immigrated to Michigan from Brownsover, Warwickshire in England, just 1.5 miles from Rugby, Warwickshire.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nEdwards attended the University of Michigan where he earned his first letter as a football player in 1924. In 1925, he played guard and tackle for the Michigan Wolverines squad that legendary coach Fielding H. Yost called \"the best team I ever coached.\" Edwards suffered a torn ligament injury in October 1925, and started only five of Michigan's eight games in 1925.\nIn 1925, Billy Evans wrote: \"The consensus is that Edwards of Michigan is the best tackle in the Big Ben. However, the fact that he has been out of the game so much because of injuries caused the experts to relegate him to the second team. At getting down the field, Edwards is a wonder and when he tackles an opponent he stays tackled. But due to the limited amount he has played it would be almost unfair to rate him ahead of men who have been in every game.\" Evans' omission of Edwards from his All-Western team drew criticism from another writer who opined: \"Most sports writers will agree that Edwards is one of the greatest tackles ever to be produced at any school and is justly deserving of All-American selection, let alone All-Conference.\"\nEdwards was named as a first-team All-American at right tackle by Walter Eckersall of the \"Chicago Tribune\". Eckersall said: \"Edwards made his presence felt in every Michigan game.\" Edwards was also selected as a second-team All-American by Grantland Rice for \"Collier's Weekly\" and Norman E. Brown. He was also selected to play in the inaugural East–West Shrine Game on December 26, 1925, in San Francisco. The 1925 Michigan team had six All-Americans, including Edwards, Bennie Oosterbaan, Benny Friedman, Robert J. Brown, Bo Molenda and Harry Hawkins.\nProfessional football.\nIn 1926, Edwards played for the American Football League's New York Yankees with Red Grange, Angus Goetz, and Paul G. Goebel. He also played in 12 games for the Detroit Panthers of the National Football League (NFL) in 1926.\nLater years.\nAfter his career as a football player ended, Edwards became the athletic director for the Detroit Police Department. He also appraised real estate and lived in Dearborn, Michigan for many years. In the 1960s, he purchased the family farm outside of Central Lake, Michigan and lived there until his death. He wrote a column for the local paper called \"The Old Crab.\"\nEdwards died in Clearwater, Florida at age 80 in 1980. In the summer of the same year, the family farm built by his maternal grandfather, S. B. Anway, celebrated its centennial anniversary. He was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Torch Lake, Michigan."

        "text": "David Gregory Huff (born August 22, 1984) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League. He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Los Angeles Angels. Huff has also played for the LG Twins of the KBO League and for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nEarly life.\nHuff attended Edison High School, the University of California, Irvine, Cypress College, and the University of California, Los Angeles.\nIn 2004 and 2005, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nProfessional career.\nHuff was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the first round, with the 39th overall selection, of the 2006 MLB draft.\nMinor leagues.\nSince 2006, Huff has played minor league baseball with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, Kinston Indians, Akron Aeros, Buffalo Bisons, and Columbus Clippers.\nIn 11 games with the Akron Aeros in 2008, Huff had a career-best ERA of 1.92. He then pitched 80 innings for the Bisons in 2008 and put up a 3.01 ERA. He was named the Indians' 2008 Minor League Player of the Year (receiving the \"Lou Boudreau Award\").\nHuff pitched for the AAA Columbus Clippers in 2009 until his call-up on May 16. He had a 5–1 record with a 4.35 ERA with the Clippers.\nCleveland Indians.\nHuff made his MLB debut with a start against the Tampa Bay Rays on May 17, 2009. He allowed seven runs in only 3.2 innings to pick up the loss. He recorded his first MLB win on June 7 when he allowed three runs in five innings against the Chicago White Sox. In 23 starts in 2009 he finished 11-8 with a 5.61 ERA.\nOn May 29, 2010, Huff was hit in the head by a comeback line drive off the bat of Alex Rodriguez. Huff was carried off the field by a medical cart several minutes later. Huff did not sustain a concussion, and returned to his regular baseball activities within 48 hours of the incident.\nHuff split his time with the Indians and the minor league affiliates during his four-year tenure with the team. Huff was designated for assignment by the Indians organization on May 24, 2013. Overall, Huff went 18–26 with a 5.40 ERA during his career with the Cleveland Indians.\nNew York Yankees.\nHuff was claimed off waivers by the Yankees on May 26, 2013 and made his Yankees debut the same day he was acquired, recording a strikeout, two walks, and allowing a run in one inning of relief pitched against the Tampa Bay Rays. He was designated for assignment on May 28, 2013 after Joba Chamberlain was activated from the disabled list. Not wanting to join a third organization, and trusting Yankees' pitching coach Larry Rothschild, Huff accepted a minor league assignment to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League, after receiving instruction from Rothschild on how to improve his delivery. In Scranton, he continued his work with Gil Patterson.\nHuff was re-added to the Yankees' 25-man major league roster and recalled from the minors on August 15, 2013. On August 22, Huff got his first win as a Yankee after pitching five innings of one-hit relief against the Toronto Blue Jays. The Yankees primarily used Huff in the long relief role, but gave him a start in place of Phil Hughes on September 7. He was 3-1 with a 4.67 ERA in 11 appearances (2 starts).\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn January 24, 2014, the Yankees traded Huff to the San Francisco Giants for cash considerations. He was designated for assignment on June 6 after posting a disappointing 6.30 ERA with 11 strikeouts and six walks in 20 innings.\nNew York Yankees (second stint).\nOn June 11, 2014, Huff was traded back to the Yankees for cash considerations. He was 3-1 with a 1.85 ERA in 30 games and became a free agent on December 2, 2014 after he was non-tendered by the Yankees.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers signed him to a minor league contract in January 2015 and invited him to spring training. He was assigned to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers. After one three inning appearance in the minors, the Dodgers purchased his contract and called him up to the Majors to start the April 14 game against the Mariners. He allowed four runs in four innings and was designated for assignment after the game. After returning to Oklahoma City, he was again recalled by the Dodgers on June 1. He was designated for assignment again on June 2 after appearing in relief in two games. He returned to the minors and appeared in 23 games for Oklahoma City, only four of which were starts. He was 5–2 with a 2.20 ERA.\nHuff was selected to be a member of the United States national baseball team for the 2015 Pan-American Games.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn January 9, 2016, Huff agreed to a minor league deal with the Kansas City Royals. He would earn $1.1 million if he made the Major League roster. He opted out of his contract on May 15, making him a free agent.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn May 18, 2016, Huff signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels. The Angels promoted Huff to the MLB to start on June 7.\nLG Twins.\nOn July 8, 2016, Huff signed a deal with the LG Twins of the KBO League.\nTokyo Yakult Swallows.\nOn December 20, 2017, Huff signed a one-year, $1.3 million contract with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nOn December 2, 2019, he become free agent.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn January 20, 2020, Huff signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks.

Huff pitched to a 5.25 ERA in 14 appearances, 9 starts for the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers before he was released on August 12, 2021.\nDiablos Rojos del México.\nOn April 8, 2022, Huff signed with the Diablos Rojos del México of the Mexican League. Huff made 21 appearances (11 starts) for México in 2022, recording a 6-1 record and 4.86 ERA with 53 strikeouts in 74.0 innings pitched. \nSaraperos de Saltillo.\nOn December 29, 2022, Huff was loaned to the Guerreros de Oaxaca. Huff was released by Oaxaca on January 18, 2023, after the team signed Eric Filia. On May 14, 2023, Huff signed with the Saraperos de Saltillo."

        "title": "2003 World Championships in Athletics – Men's 3000 metres steeplechase",
        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 3000 metres steeplechase event at the 2003 IAAF World Championships in Paris, France. There were a total number of 36 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Tuesday 2003-08-26 at 21:30h.\nAnalysis.\nIn Kenya, where the steeplechase is virtually the national sport and source of national pride, the top up and coming athletes in 2003 were Stephen Cherono and Ezekiel Kemboi. Along with Stephen's brother Abraham Cherono, they swept the 2002 Commonwealth Games Steeplechase for Kenya. In 2003, there was a huge change.\nQatar was near the beginning of their program to purchase mercenary athletes; young, promising athletes who would take Qatari citizenship and (unique to Qatar's program) take on a different name. Stephen, and some 40 other athletes, took the deal. Changing his name from Stephen Cherono to Saif Saaeed Shaheen, he was reported to have received up to US$1 million to become a Qatari citizen, although he denied this. This was the first major competition where, as Shaheen, he was wearing a different country's bib. This angered his former teammates who were determined to beat him.\nOver the previous two decades, Kenyan athletes have learned how to use team tactics to essentially gang up on the rest of the world while assuring another Kenyan victory. Shaheen had learned these tactics. Now virtually alone, he had to figure out how to beat them. He chose to run away from them. Alone out front, no team could get in his way. He did have a teammate in the race, a veteran former Sudanese athlete who had been running for Qatar for several years, Khamis Abdullah Saifeldin. Beaten off the start line by three Kenyans, Saifeldin literally elbowed his way to the already forming Kenyan blockade at the front. Sidestepping into the next lane he sprinted past them followed by Shaheen who was with the lead Kenyans waiting for his arrival. Saifeldin was first over the first barrier with Shaheen in tow and a gap already forming. The only athlete to bridge the gap was Shaheen's brother, Abraham Cherono. The first lap was just over 60 seconds, 4 minute mile pace. 2:04 by the second lap (now slightly shorter laps through the water jump). 1000 metres into the race and Saifeldin was exhausted and started to drop back. Shaheen accelerated around him. 3:06 for three laps. Soon Abraham started to fall back, Shaheen was alone. With the pack disappearing behind them, Shaheen was cranking out laps at sub-world record pace. By the fourth lap at 4:12 he had opened up a 20 metre lead, but on the fifth lap, he was beginning to show signs of fatigue.\nHis closest pursuer, Kemboi rapidly began gaining on Shaheen. With a thousand metres to go, Kemboi was frustrated with his slow gains against Shaneen's huge lead and suddenly sprinted to both catch Shaheen then to keep on running past him, creating a 7 metre gap of his own. This time Shaheen did not go away, making back the gap to mark Kemboi. Two barriers later, Shaheen sprinted into the lead and Kemboi sprinted back to the front. With all the spurts and retreats, the lead pace had slowed while the peloton had steadily made up the lost ground. Led by Luis Miguel Martín and Eliseo Martín, the pack had moved back into contention, with the French home crowd excited that Bouabdellah Tahri was in the mix with a lap to go. But the two prizefighters at the front didn't notice, they were still throwing their best punches at each other.\nAt the bell, Kemboi again sprinted to open up a slight gap. After the fourth barrier, Shaheen sprinted past, opening up a gap over the third barrier and into the water jump. This move at the fourth barrier would later become Kemboi's trademark. Also, unlike later years, Kemboi took the water jump carefully by pushing off the barrier. Coming out of the pit, Kemboi positioned himself for one final sprint, passing Shaheen over the final barrier on the outside. With a slight gap, Kemboi looked to be sprinting to victory, but Shaheen surged again taking the lead thirty metres out. Defeated, the exhausted Kemboi jogged across the line and lay down on the track.\nWhile bronze medalist Eliseo Martín, enthusiastically came to congratulate Shaheen, the Kenyans did not congratulate their former teammate, now traitor, on his victory. Even his own brother walked off the track in disgust.\nWithout Shaheen in the race, Kemboi would claim Olympic gold the following year. A couple of weeks later, Shahen would one up him again by setting what is still the current world record in the event. Shaheen would repeat as champion in 2005, again over Kemboi, but would then disappear from the scene. After three straight silver medals, Kemboi would finally take gold in 2009, beginning a legendary winning streak of four straight gold medals and seven straight gold or silver medals through 2015 and another Olympic gold in 2012. Each of those victories was marked with a celebration victory dance and the same sprint between the fourth and third remaining barriers that he learned from Shaheen in this race.\nHeats.\nHeld on Saturday 2003-08-23\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The 1987 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 8, after the conclusion of the 1986–87 NHL season. It concluded on May 31, with the Edmonton Oilers defeating the Philadelphia Flyers to win the Stanley Cup. In an attempt to reduce the number of first round upsets, the NHL expanded the Division Semifinals series from a best-of-five series to a best-of-seven series.\nThe 1987 playoffs marked the second consecutive year that all four former WHA teams made the playoffs in the same year. It would not happen again until 1999 by which time 3 of those teams had moved, the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, the Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix, and the Hartford Whalers to Raleigh. For the second time ever, the first time being 1978, all of the Original Six teams made the playoffs in the same season.\nAt the time the Philadelphia Flyers set an NHL playoff record by playing in 26 games during the playoffs. This record was equaled by four other teams (2004 Calgary Flames, 2014 Los Angeles Kings, 2015 Tampa Bay Lightning, and 2019 St. Louis Blues), this remained the most under the four-round, 16 team playoff format before the 2020 Dallas Stars broke the record during the expanded 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs under the expanded format.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nDivision semifinals.\nPrince of Wales Conference.\n(A1) Hartford Whalers vs. (A4) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams.

        "title": "Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki",
        "text": "Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki () is an oil painting on canvas completed by the French Neo-Classical painter Jacques-Louis David in 1781. A large-scale equestrian portrait, the work depicts a Polish politician, nobleman, and writer of the Enlightenment Period, Stanisław Kostka Potocki. The artist shows Potocki on horseback and wearing the sash of the Polish Order of the White Eagle. As Potocki tips his hat in a welcoming gesture to the viewer, the horse bows, while a dog can be seen barking in the lower left-hand corner of the painting.\nPotocki first encountered Jacques-Louis David in Italy during the artist's 1779–1780 Grand Tour, although the details surrounding the portrait's commission remain debated. Some historians believe Potocki directly requested it in 1780, while others suggest Ferdinand IV of Naples commissioned the work after Potocki impressed him by taming a wild horse. The portrait of Potocki was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1781 and brought to Warsaw sometime before 1801. That year, the work was transferred to the Wilanów Palace, built originally as a royal palace in the late 17th century for John III Sobieski, which had been owned by the Potocki family since 1799. In 1805, the palace became one of the first public art museums in Poland, displaying David's \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" alongside the rest of the Potocki family's art collection.\nThe painting was plundered by Nazi German forces in December 1944 and then transported to Germany. In 1952, Soviet officials informed the Polish government (by then, the Soviet-aligned Polish People's Republic) that the portrait was among numerous other works from the collection that had been restituted by the USSR in the war's aftermath. In 1956, David's painting was officially returned to Poland and placed in the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. In 1990, following the end of communist rule in Poland, it was transferred back to and put on permanent display. Now part of the state-owned Museum of King Jan III's Palace, \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" has been described as one of David's masterpieces, marking the return of equestrian portraiture to European painting of the late 18th century.\nHistorical context.\nJacques-Louis David (1748–1824).\nJacques-Louis David was a major French representative of Neo-Classicism, a 19th-century style in European academic art profoundly influenced by the aesthetic order and monumentality of classical antiquity. Between 1775 and 1780, David lived in Rome, where he was influenced by the paintings of Italian High Renaissance and early Baroque masters, prompting him to abandon the Rococo style, then dominant in France, in favor of an approach characterized, in the judgement of the art historian Kathryn Calley Galitz, by its precise contours, well-defined forms, and refined surfaces. David's style was also marked by a commitment to classical forms, echoing the visual language of Greek and Roman art, particularly following his visit to Naples in 1779. A prolific portraitist, David pursued commissions from an array of patrons, not only the aristocracy, but also what the art historian Allison Lee Palmer has called the \"enlightened middle class\". While the artist's political alliances shifted over time—he actively participated in the French Revolution before being appointed “First Painter to the Emperor” by Napoleon in 1804—David remained committed to the tenets of Neo-Classicism throughout his career.\n(1755–1821).\nPotocki reportedly first met David in Italy during the artist's 1779–1780 Grand Tour. Potocki was a Polish nobleman who would later become an influential politician in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He traveled extensively around Europe, visiting Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany between 1772 and 1775. In 1776, he married Aleksandra Lubomirska, a member of the aristocratic Polish Lubomirski family, and began his political activity in 1778 as a deputy to the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the Lublin Voivodeship.\nPotocki was a patriot and would serve as a general during the Polish–Russian War of 1792, a decisive military conflict that precipitated the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. His contributions to the country were recognized by two state awards: the Order of Saint Stanislaus in 1780 and the Order of the White Eagle in 1781. Both distinctions would later be reflected in David's depiction of Potocki. A strong advocate for public education, he served as co-founder of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Science () in 1800 and the University of Warsaw in 1816. Potocki was also an avid art collector with a strong interest in classical antiquity. He translated \"History of the Art of Antiquity\", a 1764 treatise by the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, into Polish. A comprehensive scholarly study of the history of Western ancient art, Winckelmann's book had a profound influence on the evolution of Neo-Classical art across Europe.\nCommission.\nWhile Potocki's travels to Italy between 1779 and 1780, as well as his subsequent encounter with David, have been well documented, the exact circumstances of the portrait's commission remain a subject of scholarly debate. Some art historians propose that Potocki directly requested that David paint his portrait sometime in 1780. A collection catalogue published by the Potocki family in 1834 mentioned that \"the portrait was completed in Paris after a sketch made from life in the Naples Riding School\".\nThis version of events was later confirmed by David's grandson, Jacques-Louis-Jules David, who in 1880 published an album titled celebrating the artist's oeuvre. He claimed that Ferdinand IV of Naples commissioned the painting in 1780 after Potocki had visited him in Naples. According to Jacques-Louis-Jules, Potocki impressed the king by taming a wild horse during a hunting trip, leading Ferdinand to request an equestrian portrait from David. This led some scholars to believe that David had begun painting the work in Rome in 1780 before finishing it in Paris in 1781 and exhibiting it in the same year at the Paris Salon , an official art exhibition organized by the members of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture (). In the 1960s, Polish art historian Andrzej Ryszkiewicz challenged this narrative, asserting a lack of historical evidence to confirm that the 1780 encounter between David and Potocki in Naples had ever transpired.\nWhile Ryszkiewicz's claim influenced art historical research into the origins of the work in the subsequent decades, a 2019 conservation report from the Museum of King Jan III's Palace in lent credibility to the account of David's grandson. The report analyzed x-rays of the original painting and an early modello of the composition—a preparatory study drawing initially believed to be a 19th-century sketch. The drawing portrays Potocki adorned with the Order of St. Stanislaus ribbon, awarded in 1780, rather than the Polish Order of the White Eagle, which he received in 1781. These findings led researchers to conclude that the 1780 drawing was an original work by David, created in Naples. Additionally, the x-rays exposed red paint beneath the existing blue ribbon, further substantiating the notion that the painting's initial design was meant to showcase the Order of St. Stanislaus.\nAnalysis.\nDescription.\nDavid depicts Potocki on horseback against a grey wall on top of which two classical columns are placed. Art historian Antoine Schnapper notes that the presence of straw beneath the horse's hooves could suggest a stable setting, while the \"stately architecture\" in the background might hint at an imaginary or idealized backdrop. Potocki is depicted with no coat and only the blue sash of the Polish Order of the White Eagle, the country's highest civilian order, indicates his rank. He is attired in what Palmer characterized as the \"finest\" clothing: yellow trousers and a white shirt. Potocki is seen removing his hat in a cordial greeting to the viewer, as the horse lowers its head. In the lower left-hand corner, a dog can be observed barking at the horse.\nInfluences and scholarship.\nThe portrait has been described as one of David's masterpieces, and marking the return to prominence of equestrian portraiture in European late 18th-century painting. The art historian Lorenz Eitner notes the influence of two 17th-century Flemish Baroque painters, Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, on David's 1781 portrait, and argues that the painting \"offers a premonition of the manner in which [David] was later to treat modern, national subjects\". According to Antoine Schnapper, the painting recalls van Dyck's 1634 equestrian portrait of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, a sketch of which David had completed prior to painting the Polish nobleman.\nSchnapper also concludes that the \"horse's forequarters\" correspond to a 17th-century tapestry fragment illustrating the story of Publius Decius Mus, a 4th-century BCE Roman consul known for sacrificing himself during the Second Latin War. The tapestry, designed after a composition originally painted by Rubens in 1618, had been copied by David sometime prior to 1780 and later exhibited at the Louvre. The importance of Rubens is also noted by the American art historian Robert Rosenblum who described the horse in Potocki's portrait as a \"Rubensian stallion\". In examining the formal qualities of the composition, the French scholar of 18th-century art Charlotte Guichard highlights the atypical placement of the artist's signature found on the dog's golden collar in the bottom left corner of the painting. She suggests that by \"breaking dynamically into the space of representation, David's glittering name shines forth, catching the light and the viewer's attention\".\nScholars have also addressed the political resonance of the painting. According to Palmer, the portrait might symbolize the \"prerevolutionary debate\" of whether the nobility were \"superior merely by blood or also of mind\". Analyzing Eastern European representation in the late 18th-century Western art, historian Larry Wolff considers that the motif of horsemanship alluded to the \"taming and harnessing\" of Eastern Europe more broadly, in common with other works of art from the 1780s. He observes that \"the Polish nobleman astride a perfectly poised, intensely muscled horse, head bent in submission beneath a dramatic mane\" is depicted with great discipline. Moreover, the French art historian Philippe Bordes positions the painting alongside David's other contemporary portraits of prominent social figures—including the 1788 depiction of the French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze—created by an artist he asserts was \"determined to engage his talent to climb the social ladder\".\nReception and ownership.\nParis Salon (1781).\nIn his 1930 biographical study of the artist, art historian Richard Cantinelli noted that David began working on the \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" in Rome and departed for Paris on July 17, 1780. In Paris, he finished the painting and displayed it at the 1781 Salon. The exhibition was David's Salon debut and Potocki's portrait was shown alongside \"Belisarius Begging for Alms\", \"Saint Roch Interceding with the Virgin for the Plague-Stricken\",\"The Funeral Games of Patroclus\", and a composition titled \"A Woman Suckling Her Child\", all of which were praised by the French Enlightenment philosopher and prominent writer Denis Diderot. When discussing Potocki's portrait, Diderot singled out David's light color palette, which stood in contrast to history paintings completed by the artist during the same period.\nAlthough \"Belisarius Begging for Alms\" has received the highest amount of praise from contemporary critics, \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" has since been described as one of the paintings that \"cemented David's success\". David's debut at the 1781 Salon proved to be an important artistic milestone and helped to establish him as \"the most promising painter of the rising generation\". Following its display in Paris, the portrait was sent to Warsaw, although the precise timeline of its movements remains uncertain. Existing records indicate that it was transferred to Wilanów Palace, a former royal residence near Warsaw owned by Potocki, on December 5, 1801. The Baroque palace and its accompanying gardens, originally built for King John III Sobieski and his wife Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien in 1681–1696, was inherited by Izabela Lubomirska, the sister of Potocki's wife Aleksandra, in 1778.\nLater years (1781–1939).\nThe ownership of Wilanów was transferred to Potocki in 1799, who would amass a significant collection of European and East Asian art. David's portrait of Potocki was placed on the eastern wall of the Great Hall (now known as the \"White Hall\") of the palace. in 1805, the collection was officially opened to the public, becoming one of the first public art museums in Poland. In 1831, amid concerns of potential Russian pillaging due to the November Uprising—an armed insurrection that had erupted on 29 November 1830 against the occupying Russian Empire—the portrait of Potocki was relocated to Warsaw for safekeeping, where it remained until 1834.\nPlaced on public display at the palace until 1864, it was then moved to private quarters to become part of the Potocki family portrait collection put together by August Potocki, Stanisław's grandson. In 1877, Aleksandra Potocka, August's widow, published an illustrated catalogue of the collection, which included a reproduction of David's portrait of . The ownership of the palace and the collection was subsequently passed to the Branicki family in 1892. In 1913, it was featured in David's retrospective titled at the Petit Palais in Paris. In 1932, the portrait, along with several other works by David, was shown at the \"Exhibition of French Art 1200–1900\", an extensive survey show of French art across seven centuries, organized at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. In 1937, it was exhibited at Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne in Paris.\nWorld War II and its aftermath.\nIn 1944, during World War II, \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" was looted by the Nazi forces. According to surviving records, the painting was stolen by a group led by the Wehrmacht General Eberhard Kinzel in December 1944, who first transported it to Świdnica and then to Germany. During Jacques-Louis David's bi-centenary exhibition in Paris in 1948, art historian Douglas Cooper described the portrait of Potocki as one of the \"important works\" missing from the show. In 1952, Soviet authorities informed the Polish government (by then the USSR-aligned Polish People's Republic), that they had retrieved numerous works from the Wilanów collection as part of their wider post-war restitution campaign that spanned across Germany. According to Stanisław Lorentz, who was the director of the National Museum in Warsaw at the time, the initial set of works was repatriated to Poland in the same year. The remaining works, which included the portrait by David and Jan Matejko's \"Stańczyk\" from 1862, among numerous other paintings and works on paper, were returned during an official ceremony held at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg (then Leningrad) in 1956. \nSubsequently, the portrait was placed in the collection of the National Museum in Warsaw. In 1990, after the fall of communism in Poland, the work was transferred back to , then part of the National Museum in Warsaw, and placed on public display. In 1995, the palace became an independent national museum and in 2013, it was renamed the Museum of King John III's Palace at Wilanów. In 2016, after undergoing extensive conservation, the painting was moved from the North Hall to the White Hall, its original location during the early 1800s where David's painting remains on view as of .\nPrint reproductions and copies.\nThe painting has been often reproduced in print, most famously in the 1880 publication by Jacques-Louis-Jules David, which resulted in renewed interest in David's portrait of Potocki at the end of the 19th century. Moreover, several copies of the painting are said to have been completed over time, including those painted by David himself. Some scholars proposed that the painting originally commissioned by Ferdinand IV could be distinct from another work intended for Potocki, as suggested by the existence of a receipt the artist provided to Potocki on 30 June 1780, and follow-up correspondence between the two dated 10 July 1780.\nIn an 1877 ledger from Palace, \"Equestrian Portrait of Count Stanislas Potocki\" is described as \"a study by David\" made in 1781 which was bought later in Paris by Elżbieta Izabela Lubomirska for her daughter Aleksandra Potocka, prompting some researchers to speculate that the portrait currently in the collection might itself be David's copy of the original work. The ledger also makes no mention of the 1781 Paris Salon, where the original painting is believed to have been first exhibited. Existing records further point to versions of the work made by other artists, including a 1791 copy by the Polish artist Franciszek Smuglewicz, which has since been lost, as well as one made in or around 1905 by the painter Wacław Pawliszak. Assertions about the existence of purported additional copies of the portrait have also emerged in the 21st century, though these claims have not yet been verified by researchers."

The final was held on 24 August 2003.\nAt this point in time, Haile Gebrselassie was the #1 distance runner in the world, with two successive Olympic titles and four World Championships at 10,000. He also held the 5-year-old world record plus the world record at 5,000 metres. A poor race at the previous World Championships was the first sign of his lack of total dominance, now the 30 year old had a challenger from near his home town, who also ran with an almost identical, efficient running form, 21 year old Kenenisa Bekele. As Gebrselassie ran a strong race trying to burn off his new rival, the rest of the world's best runners, including five Kenyan born athletes, disappeared in their wake. The last to hold on to the lead group was Sileshi Sihine, assuring an Ethiopian sweep, but the championship was in doubt. Bekele remained as Gebrselassie's twin shadow until he made one move with 200 metres to go. Gebrselassie's ever powerful sprint was no match for Bekele. Over the final straightaway, Bekele extended to more than a full second gap for the victory and the changing of the guard in dominance of long distance track running. Bekele took the prize at the next Olympics over Sihine with Gebrselassie out of the money and accomplished the Woolworth double (5 and 10) in 2008. Gebrselassie subsequently focused his effort onto 10k, half-marathon and marathon competitions, setting multiple world records before retiring.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The original plan was to include Dannevirke and name the team \"70 Mile Bush\", but the Dannevirke club instead opted to remain part of Hawke's Bay\nIn 1971 Bush amalgamated with the Wairarapa Rugby Football Union to form Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union. In 1950 the Wairarapa and Bush unions put up a combined team to play the touring British Lions, losing 13–27 \nRanfurly Shield.\nBush had seven unsuccessful challenges for the Ranfurly Shield between 1927 and 1968:\nAll Blacks.\nBush had only one All Black during their existence, Athol \"Tonk\" Mahoney who represented New Zealand in 26 matches between 1929 and 1936. Mahoney also played 36 matches for the Bush union between 1927 and 1939."

        "text": "Dan Johnson (born May 17, 1960) is a former professional American football player who played tight end for seven seasons for the Miami Dolphins. Before his NFL career, Jonson played college football at Iowa State University. He did not play until his Junior season, and caught only 4 passes that year (though they were good for 116 yards and two touchdowns). As a senior, Johnson caught 21 passes for 290 yards. He was later selected by Miami with their 7th round pick in the 1983 NFL draft.\nJohnson told ESPN's John Barr on January 28, 2011, that he took about 1000 pain killers per month during his playing days, as a result of the numerous injuries and broken bones he suffered. Teammates nicknamed him \"King of Pain\" as a result of all the broken bones he had during his career. He was also the only player to catch a touchdown pass from Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino in Super Bowl XIX."

Their home games are played at Hec Edmundson Pavilion, located in Seattle, and they are currently led by head coach Danny Sprinkle.\nHec Edmundson Pavilion.\nHec Edmundson Pavilion is the home for the Huskies men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball team and gymnastics squad. The 2020–21 season marks the 94th season of service for the multi-purpose facility. The facility was originally completed in December 1927. Wilson James Commissioning renovated the interior of Hec Edmundson Pavilion for $40 million. The renovation lasted 19 months between March 1999 and November 2000. The pavilion's name was also changed; originally slated to be \"Seafirst Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" when the deal was finalized in 1998, it became \"Bank of America Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\" at the reopening, as Bank of America had retired the Seafirst brand in 1999. The ten-year sponsorship with the bank expired after the 2009–10 season and was not renewed; during the first half of the 2010–11 basketball season the venue was sponsorless and once again known simply as \"Hec Edmundson Pavilion\". On January 20, 2011, the university approved Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as the new sponsor of \"Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion\".\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThrough 2020, the Huskies have appeared in 17 NCAA Tournaments, with an overall record of \nNIT results.\nThrough 2019, the Huskies have appeared in nine National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), with an 8–9 overall record.\nCBI results.\nThrough 2019, the Huskies have appeared in one College Basketball Invitational (CBI), with a record of 0–1.\nResults by season (2002–present).\nThe following are Washington's recent results.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Huskies men's basketball team appears in the 1997 film \"The 6th Man\" with a fictional roster, of which are part the film's main characters, the brothers Kenny (Marlon Wayans) and Antoine Tyler (Kadeem Hardison). Much of the film was shot on location in Hec-Ed and around the actual campus."

        "text": "The women's road race of the 2008 UCI Road World Championships cycling event took place on 27 September in Varese, Italy. The course comprised eight laps around a 17.35-kilometre route, making a total distance of 138.8 km. Each lap featured two ascents: the first at Montello (6.5% gradient for 1.15 kilometres); and the second at Ronchi, Gallarate (4.5% for 3.13 kilometres). The race included a total of 1,937 metres of climbing.\nPre-race favourites included Varese local rider Noemi Cantele and her teammates Tatiana Guderzo and Giorgia Bronzini, Marianne Vos of the Netherlands, Judith Arndt of Germany (champion in 2004), reigning Olympic champion Nicole Cooke and silver medallist Emma Johansson. Notably missing from the start list was Marta Bastianelli, reigning champion from 2007, who was awaiting a verdict on a non-negative drug test result in July 2008.\nThe race was won by Great Britain's Nicole Cooke, with Marianne Vos and Judith Arndt finishing with the same time, second and third respectively. Cooke was the first British woman to win the race since Mandy Jones in 1982.\nThe race.\nNot long after the race began, a Swedish rider brought down the front row of the peloton when her tyres slipped on some painted letters on the road. Christine Thorburn was also brought down in a crash, when she was squeezed up against a fence. Although she was not severely injured and did attempt to chase the bunch, she failed to make contact and did not finish.\nA group of thirteen riders soon broke away from the main group, driven mainly by the American Kristin Armstrong. They gained 25 seconds on the field but were pulled back by the Dutch and British teams with one lap to go. As soon as the break was caught, Marianne Vos launched a counter-attack on the Montello climb, Nicole Cooke, Judith Arndt, Trixi Worrack and Emma Johansson, and Susanne Ljungskog joined her in what was to become the winning break. Ljungskog's chances ended when she punctured, leaving five in the break.\nWorrack and Vos attacked on the final hill, but were brought back to the break with 2 km to go. The race finished with a sprint, Vos took the lead before being overtaken by Cooke just before the finish line. Arndt struggled to match their speed in the sprint, she was nearly caught out by a late surge by Johansson, but eventually crossed the line in third place.\nFinal classification.\nDid not finish.\n45 riders failed to finish the race. Mayuko Hagiwara of Japan was disqualified, and Grassi Herrera of Mexico did not start the race."

There were a total number of 36 participating athletes, with five qualifying heats, three semi-finals and the final held on Friday August 29, 2003 at 22:05h.\nSummary.\nFélix Sánchez went out with purpose, to defend his championship, taking a clear lead over the first hurdle. He never looked back, just continuing to extend his lead to win by almost a full second. His winning time of 47.25 turned out to be the lifetime personal record of the future double Olympic gold medalist. It was the number 7 time in history, at the time, and has only been surpassed once since, by .01 by 2008 gold medalist Angelo Taylor, though it was also tied by Kerron Clement as he won the 2016 Olympics (which name-checks all Olympic champions from this era, 2000-2016).\nBehind Sánchez was the battle for the other medals. Immediately outside of Sánchez, Joey Woody started slower, so Sánchez made up the stagger and passed Woody between the second and third hurdle. The closest to Sánchez, immediately to his inside was Periklis Iakovakis. Through the final turn, Chris Rawlinson and Danny McFarlane began to pull even with Iakovakis. By the eighth hurdle, Llewellyn Herbert pulled even with McFarlane. Between the eighth and ninth hurdles, Herbert put on a burst that put a meter on everyone except Sánchez, with Woody moving into contention behind him. Herbert had a firm grasp on silver until he hit the tenth hurdle, sprawling him to the track. Woody was the next to clear the hurdle and finished strongly to take that silver, a meter ahead of Iakovakis.\nSemi-final.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHeats.\nHeld on Tuesday 2003-08-26\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Mike McKenna (born April 11, 1983) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender. McKenna was selected in the 6th round (172nd overall) of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators and played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Tampa Bay Lightning, New Jersey Devils, Columbus Blue Jackets, Arizona Coyotes, Dallas Stars, Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nAs a youth, McKenna played in the 1997 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the St. Louis Blues minor ice hockey team. He later played for the Springfield Jr. Blues in the North American Hockey League for two seasons from 1999 to 2001.\nCollege.\nMcKenna played his college hockey for St. Lawrence University, an NCAA Division I team in the ECAC. He played for St. Lawrence for four seasons from 2001 to 2005. He was drafted by the Nashville Predators in the sixth round of the 2002 NHL Entry Draft.\nProfessional.\nBeginning in 2005, McKenna played for the Las Vegas Wranglers for parts of two seasons at the beginning of his professional career. During the 2006–07 ECHL season, he compiled an impressive 27–4–2 record with five shutouts. He was named to the All-Star team and finished second in the league voting for Most Valuable Player. He played one season (2007–08) with the Portland Pirates in the American Hockey League (AHL).\nMcKenna was signed to an AHL contract by the Tampa Bay Lightning's affiliate Norfolk Admirals for the 2008–09 season after drifting from several AHL teams during the previous seasons, including a previous stint for Norfolk during the 2005–06 season. He played better than expected, earning Norfolk's starting goalie position. He had an 11–10–0 record with one shutout through early February, when he was signed to an NHL contract by the Lightning after Olaf Kölzig went down for the season with an injury. He made his NHL debut on February 3, 2009, versus the New York Islanders, relieving starter Karri Rämö. The following day, he made his first NHL start in goal on February 4 against the Pittsburgh Penguins, shutting the Penguins out through two periods before losing 4–3 in overtime. McKenna earned his first NHL win and shutout on February 7 with a 28 save, 1–0 home win against the New York Islanders, less than a week into his NHL career.\nIn 2009, McKenna signed with the New Jersey Devils organization and played one season with the Lowell Devils. That summer the franchise was moved to Albany, NY and became the Albany Devils, where McKenna played one season. He also played two games in the NHL for New Jersey. McKenna's only NHL start of the season was against his hometown St. Louis Blues.\nIn July 2011, McKenna signed a one-year contract with the Ottawa Senators. He played the whole season with the Senators AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Senators.\nOn July 1, 2012, McKenna signed a one-year, two-way contract with the St. Louis Blues. He once again played the whole season with the AHL affiliate (Peoria Rivermen).\nFor a third consecutive season, McKenna continued his journeyman career and signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Columbus Blue Jackets on July 5, 2013. He started the season in their AHL affiliate the Springfield Falcons but was recalled by the Blue Jackets on December 3, 2013, after Sergei Bobrovsky went down with an injury. On December 12, 2013, McKenna made his Blue Jackets debut in relief of an injured Curtis McElhinney, saving 17 of 18 shots faced in a 4–2 win against the New York Rangers.\nOn July 1, 2014, McKenna signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Arizona Coyotes. He started the season with the AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates, whom he had previously played for. In the 2014–15 season, after the trading away of Arizona goaltender Devan Dubnyk, McKenna was recalled to the NHL again where he started one game for the Coyotes.\nWith the Coyotes changing AHL affiliates to Springfield, MA, McKenna was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the new Portland Pirates' parent club, the Florida Panthers, on July 1, 2015. He spent the majority of the season with the Pirates, save for a two-game recall beginning on February 29, 2016 and ending March 4.\nMcKenna began the 2016–17 season with the Springfield Thunderbirds (formerly the Portland Pirates). On March 1, 2017, he returned to the Tampa Bay Lightning organization after he was traded by the Panthers in exchange for fellow goaltender Adam Wilcox. Assuming the starting role with AHL affiliate the Syracuse Crunch, McKenna's veteran experience helped the Crunch to advance to the Calder Cup Finals. He recorded a career high 13 playoff wins, and is tied for the Crunch franchise single playoff win record with Cedrick Desjardins with 13.\nOn July 1, 2017, McKenna signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Dallas Stars. In the 2017–18 season, McKenna spent the majority of the season with the Stars AHL affiliate in Texas, helping them reach the Calder Cup finals, his second successive appearance. He was recalled by Dallas for the last month and a half of the regular season, appearing in two NHL contests and earning his first win since 2014.\nAs a free agent in the off-season, McKenna extended his career in agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract with the Ottawa Senators on July 1, 2018. He joined AHL affiliate, the Belleville Senators to begin the 2018–19 season. After six games with Belleville, McKenna was recalled by Ottawa. He appeared in 10 games with the Senators, posting 1-4-1 record before he was traded along with Tom Pyatt and a 2019 sixth round draft pick to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for Anders Nilsson and Darren Archibald on January 2, 2019. He was waived after backing up Jacob Markström for two games, with the Canucks' intention being to reassign him to their AHL affiliate, the Utica Comets. He was promptly claimed on waivers by the Philadelphia Flyers as they dealt with injuries to goaltenders Brian Elliott, Michal Neuvirth, and Anthony Stolarz. McKenna made his Flyers debut on January 8, 2019 against the Washington Capitals. He was the seventh goaltender to start for the Flyers in the 2018–19 season in only the 43rd game. On January 30, 2019, McKenna agreed to a 14-day conditioning loan with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. He went 2-1 during the stint while playing for an AHL-record thirteenth franchise.\nOn February 20, 2019, McKenna was waived by the Flyers.\nOn August 27, 2019, McKenna announced his retirement from professional hockey. Following his retirement, he was hired as a TV analyst for the Vegas Golden Knights.\nPersonal life.\nMcKenna is a fan of Swedish death metal band Amon Amarth."

As soon as Estévez began to create some daylight, El Guerrouj covered the move through a 57.70 first lap, but after letting Estévez lead a whole lap El Guerrouj edged ahead. It was 1:56.29 (58.59) after 2 laps with Baala the first to follow El Guerrouj, with Paul Korir and Estévez in such close order drill that Korir stumbled from catching Estévez' legs and losing ground. At the bell in 2:37.87, Fouad Chouki joined what was becoming a breakaway by El Guerrouj, Baala and Estévez. 2:51.28 (54.99) after 3 laps and El Guerrouj accelerated. In the final turn, Chouki accelerated past Estévez, but only Baala had managed to stay close to El Guerrouj. Bala was in perfect position to run around El Guerrouj coming off the turn, instead El Guerrouj accelerated again and got enough of a gap that it was clear he was going to win. Coming off the turn Ivan Heshko was in sixth place. He moved out to lane 3 and began sprinting, challenged by Korir. 50 meters from the finish, Chouki began to run out of gas. Estévez passed him but his hold on the bronze medal position was short-lived as Heshko, Korir and Rui Silva all ran past him before the line.

This was considered a meeting ground half way. From the start, Bekele took the race out to let his endurance burn off the faster opponent. El Guerrouj immediately marked his move. Also along for the ride were two more Ethiopians and a pack of four Kenyans, including defending champion Richard Limo. While the group broke away from the field, the fast early pace slowed. With two laps to go, it was El Guerrouj who took out the lead. The next lap burnt off a couple of Ethiopians but the Kenyans were all there with Bekele, still in contact with El Guerrouj. As the final lap quickened, world junior record holder, eighteen year old Eliud Kipchoge rode on El Guerrouj's shoulder, with Bekele chasing in third. El Guerrouj opened up a gap of 3 metres down the back stretch, with Bekele gaining on Kipchoge, the rest of the Kenyan team strung out behind. Challenged by Bekele, Kipchoge accelerated through the turn, moving up to El Guerrouj's shoulder. With Bekele moving onto Kipchoge's shoulder, it was three abreast coming off the turn and John Kibowen tailing closely behind. El Guerrouj accelerated again but Kipchoge didn't go away. On the outside Bekele made up some ground, the three separated by a metre. But El Guerrouj and Kipchoge were dead even. As Bekele couldn't make up any more ground, Kipchoge gained a few inches on El Guerrouj. Over the last few steps, El Guerrouj struggled and lost his form, trying to make a desperate dive at the line, but it was too little too late. The final lap was 53 seconds.\nBy this point in time, none of the three medalists had achieved an Olympic Gold Medal, though ultimately all three would. The same three would match up the following year in the 2004 Olympics with El Guerrouj taking gold.\nHeats.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Carroll was named the Big 12's Preseason Newcomer of the Year. With all of this in mind, the Big 12 coaches selected Missouri fifth in the Big 12 preseason poll.\nThe Tigers played two preseason games in 2007. The first was against the University of Missouri–St. Louis, winning this game 78–51. The second of their two preseason games was against Missouri Western State University. They won this game by a score of 113–55.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=|Preseason \n!colspan=12 style=|Non-Conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|Big 12 Tournament "

        "title": "Jordan Hill (basketball)",
        "text": "Jordan Craig Hill (born July 27, 1987) is an American former professional basketball player.\nHill played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats before he was drafted eighth overall in the 2009 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. He was traded in the middle of his rookie season to the Houston Rockets, and was again involved in a midseason trade to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011–12. In 2015, he signed with the Indiana Pacers, but departed after just one season, signing with the Timberwolves in 2016.\nEarly life and college.\nJordan Hill was born in Newberry, South Carolina. After Hill's mother died of breast cancer when Hill was three, Hill was raised by his father and grandmother and later older brother and older sister. His cousin, Trevor Booker, introduced him to basketball. Booker, who is four months younger than Hill, also became a player in the NBA. Hill attended North Springs High School in Atlanta, and the parents of a classmate became Hill's legal guardians. After graduating from North Springs in 2005, Hill spent a year at a prep school in Patterson, North Carolina, The Patterson School. As a junior in high school, Hill was ineligible to play on the school basketball team, so he showcased his skills to potential college coaches through an AAU club based in Smyrna, Georgia.\nAt the University of Arizona, Hill played three years with the Wildcats basketball team. He left Arizona ranked fifth all-time in field goal percentage (57.8%). As a junior (2008–2009), Hill started all 34 games and averaged 18.3 points and 11.0 rebounds. He earned Honorable Mention All-America from the Associated Press, Third-Team All-America honors from \"The Sporting News\", and first-team all-conference and All-Defensive Team honors both from the Pac-10 conference that year.\nProfessional career.\nNBA draft.\nWhen Hill entered the 2009 NBA draft, many had him high up on the draft board, possibly a top 5 pick in the draft. As draft night went on and Stephen Curry was taken by Golden State, it left New York to pick Jordan Hill.\nNew York Knicks (2009–2010).\nHill was drafted as the 8th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the New York Knicks. Hill earned about $4.3 million over the next two seasons.\nHill played five games in the 2009 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 14.4 ppg, 8.2 rebounds, 0.6 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.0 block. His highest-scoring game was 21-point performance against the Washington Wizards.\nHill scored his first regular season points for the Knicks against the Cleveland Cavaliers on November 6, 2009.\nHill was traded 25 games into his rookie season.\nHouston Rockets (2010–2012).\nOn the trading deadline on February 18, 2010, Hill was traded along with Jared Jeffries to the Houston Rockets as part of a three-team deal that included Sacramento that saw the Rockets' Tracy McGrady go to the New York Knicks. Hill was traded 25 games into his rookie season by the Knicks.\nLos Angeles Lakers (2012–2015).\nAt the trade deadline again on March 15, 2012, Hill was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for point guard Derek Fisher and a protected first-round draft pick from Dallas. Hill played in seven regular season games with the Lakers, averaging 4.7 points and 4.4 rebounds in 11.7 minutes. In 12 playoff games, he averaged 4.8 points and 6.3 rebounds in 18.1 minutes.\nOn July 25, 2012, Hill re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $8 million contract. The Lakers struggled during the 2012–13 season, but he brought hustle that was lacking in the team. On January 6, 2013, against the Denver Nuggets, Hill suffered a major injury when Denver's Andre Miller drove baseline on Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant, who inadvertently stepped on Hill's foot; however, Hill was also moving and pulled his hip. Surgery was required after doctors found loose fragments and a possible labral tear. In 29 games, he was averaging 6.7 points and 5.7 rebounds in 15.8 minutes per game. His rebounds-per-minute average was among the league's best, prompting Bryant to lament Hill's absence after the Lakers were outrebounded during a game. Hill was cleared to play during the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.\nOn November 12, 2013, in the ninth game of the 2013–14 season, Hill was a starter for the first time during the season and scored a career-high 21 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in a 116–95 Lakers home win.\nOn July 23, 2014, Hill re-signed with the Lakers.\nIndiana Pacers (2015–2016).\nOn July 14, 2015, Hill signed with the Indiana Pacers. He made his debut for the Pacers in the team's season opener against the Toronto Raptors on October 28, recording 8 points and 8 rebounds off the bench in a 106–99 loss.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2016–2017).\nOn July 20, 2016, Hill signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves. On June 26, 2017, he was waived by the Timberwolves.\nNorth American Premier League (2017–2018).\nIn 2017 and 2018, Hill played in the North American Premier Basketball league for the Nevada Desert Dogs and Vancouver Knights."

        "text": "Isaiah Jamar Thomas (born February 7, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He most notably played with the Boston Celtics from 2015 through 2017, when he was a two-time NBA All-Star and named second-team All-NBA.\nThe point guard played three years of college basketball for the Washington Huskies and was a three-time all-conference selection in the Pac-10. After electing to forgo his senior year of college, Thomas was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the final pick in the 2011 NBA draft. He spent three seasons with the Kings before joining the Phoenix Suns in 2014. Thomas was traded to Boston in February 2015. In the 2016–17 season, he led the Celtics to the first seed of the Eastern Conference, had the third-highest points-per-game average in the league, and finished fifth in MVP voting.\nAfter injuring his right hip during the 2016–2017 season, Thomas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in August 2017. Over the next several seasons, Thomas's hip injury significantly hampered his play. Thomas went on to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Denver Nuggets, the Washington Wizards, the New Orleans Pelicans, the Dallas Mavericks, the Grand Rapids Gold of the NBA G League, the Charlotte Hornets, and the Salt Lake City Stars.\nEarly life.\nIsaiah Thomas was born on February 7, 1989 to James Thomas and Tina Baldtrip. A lifelong Lakers fan, James Thomas made a bet with a friend that if his beloved team did not defeat the Detroit Pistons in the 1989 NBA Finals, he would name his son after Pistons star and decorated Lakers nemesis Isiah Thomas. Thomas was born months before the finals took place but his father had warmed to the name and his mother consented on the condition that the Biblical spelling of Isaiah was utilized. Thomas was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. As a child, he had the nicknames \"Bighead\" (or Head) from his father and \"Zeke\" (which was Isiah Thomas's nickname) from his mother.\nHigh school career.\nThomas attended Curtis Senior High School in University Place, Washington, through 11th grade. As his grades had to improve to earn a scholarship, he repeated his senior year across the country at South Kent School in South Kent, Connecticut. He graduated from the Connecticut prep school in 2008. At Curtis High, playing for the varsity basketball team, Thomas had averaged 31.2 points per game as a junior. He called a news briefing on April 20, 2006, to announce his intention to sign with the University of Washington.\nCollege career.\nThomas received the blessing of Nate Robinson, the former Washington Huskies star, to wear his No. 2 jersey. He scored a season-high 27 points in an 81–67 home win over Morgan State on December 30, 2008. \nThomas averaged 15.5 points, 2.6 assists, and 3.0 rebounds per game as a true freshman. He was named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year. As a sophomore, his averages rose to 16.9 points, 3.2 assists, and 3.9 rebounds per game. He was selected first team All-Pac-10.\nThomas was again named first team All-Pac-10 in his junior year. On March 12, 2011, Thomas scored 28 points and hit a game-winning buzzer beater in overtime to lead the Huskies to victory over Arizona in the championship game of the Pac-10 tournament. He was among the final ten candidates for the Bob Cousy Award in his junior season.\nOn March 31, 2011, Thomas declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his final year of college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nSacramento Kings (2011–2014).\nBefore the 2011 NBA draft, Thomas participated in his own pre-draft documentary entitled \"Road to the NBA–The Isaiah Thomas Story\".

Thomas was also named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team and finished seventh in NBA Rookie of the Year voting.\nOn January 19, 2014, Thomas scored a then-career-high of 38 points during a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Five days later, he tied this same total in points against the Indiana Pacers. On March 18, 2014, he recorded his first career triple-double with 24 points, 11 assists, and 10 rebounds in a 117–111 overtime win over the Washington Wizards; in so doing, Thomas became the shortest player to ever record a triple-double in the NBA. During the 2013–14 season, Thomas joined Calvin Murphy (twice), Dana Barros, Damon Stoudamire, and Michael Adams as the only players under tall to average over 20 points and six assists per game in a season.\nThomas was immensely popular in his three seasons in Sacramento; his show of solidarity and frequent appearances at City Council meetings during the Kings' relocation saga, in particular, endeared him to many fans.\nPhoenix Suns (2014–2015).\nOn July 12, 2014, Thomas was acquired by the Phoenix Suns in a sign-and-trade deal that also sent the rights of Alex Oriakhi to the Kings. On August 14, 2014, Thomas underwent a successful arthroscopy of his left wrist, for an injury sustained the previous season.

During his Celtics tenure, Thomas emerged as a star, a fan favorite, and an \"elite crunch-time scorer\".\nThomas made his debut for the Celtics on February 18, 2015, in a 118–111 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, scoring 21 points off the bench. On March 2, 2015, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, February 23, through Sunday, March 1. He later missed eight games in March with a bruised lower back.

On December 16, 2015, Thomas tied his then-career high of 38 points in a 119–116 loss to the Detroit Pistons. On January 28, 2016, he was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.

He became only the ninth Celtic to score 40 points in a playoff game. With 28 points in Game 4, Thomas helped the Celtics even the series at 2–2 with a 104–95 overtime win. However, the Celtics went on to lose the series 4–2.\nThomas scored 20 or more points in 20 of the first 21 games of the 2016–2017 season. He was injured in a December 5, 2016, game against the Houston Rockets and received a platelet-rich plasma injection. After returning from a four-game absence for what the Celtics described as a groin strain, Thomas continued to put up big numbers. On December 20, he scored a then-career-high 44 points in a 112–109 overtime win over the Memphis Grizzlies. He also matched his career best for three-pointers, going 7-of-10 from outside the arc. He earned Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors for the week spanning December 19 through December 25. On December 30 against Miami, he scored 29 of his career-high 52 points in the fourth quarter, setting a franchise record for points in a period and leading Boston to a 117–114 victory. Thomas's 52 points was the fourth-highest scoring total in Celtics history—Larry Bird holds the record, having scored 60 points in March 1985 game. On January 3, 2017, Thomas recorded 29 points and a career-high 15 assists in a 115–104 win over the Utah Jazz. \nOn January 26, 2017, Thomas was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game. Thomas averaged 32.9 points in January, marking the third-highest monthly average in team history. On February 2, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January.

On February 15, Thomas scored 33 points in a 116–108 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. It was his 40th straight 20-point game, tying a team record set by John Havlicek during the 1971–72 season. The following day, he broke Havlicek's team record with a 41st straight 20-point game; he scored 29 points in a 104–103 loss to the Chicago Bulls. With 19 points against the Atlanta Hawks on February 27, Thomas's franchise-record streak of consecutive 20-point games ended at 43. It was only the second time during the season that he did not score at least 20 points in a game. \nThomas suffered an injury in a March 15, 2017, game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and missed the following two games. With 32 points against the Milwaukee Bucks on March 29, Thomas became only the sixth Celtic ever to score 2,000 points in a single season. He also extended his streak with at least one three-pointer to a franchise-best 50 straight games. Behind Thomas's leadership, the Celtics finished the 2016–2017 season as the top seed in the Eastern Conference; the team's record was 53–29. Thomas finished the regular season as the third-leading scorer in the NBA, averaging 28.9 points per game.\nIn the 2017 playoffs, Thomas led the Celtics to a first-round series victory over the Chicago Bulls after learning the day before the series began that his younger sister, Chyna Thomas, had died in a car accident. After the Celtics defeated the Bulls four games to two, he flew cross-country to attend his sister's funeral. Thomas returned to Boston for Game One of the Eastern Conference Semifinals and helped the Celtics defeat the Washington Wizards 123–111. According to ESPN, during Game One, \"Thomas lost a front tooth following an inadvertent elbow from Otto Porter, requiring surgery to replace it and fix two other shifted teeth. He played through the dental wreck and scored 33 points and notched nine assists in the win. He didn't miss a game\". In Game Two against Washington, Thomas scored 53 points—the second-highest total in Celtics playoff history—to help Boston win 129–119 in overtime and take a 2–0 lead in the series. He became only the fifth Celtic to score 50 or more points in a postseason game, missing John Havlicek's team record by one point. In Game Seven against Washington, Thomas scored 29 points and had 12 assists to help the Celtics advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2012 with a 115–105 win. \nAfter the Celtics lost the first two games of the 2017 Eastern Conference Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Thomas was ruled out for the remainder of the postseason with a hip injury. In a statement, the Celtics said: Isaiah Thomas will miss the remainder of this year's postseason following re-aggravation of a right femoral-acetabular impingement with labral tear during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Cleveland. Thomas initially injured the hip during the third quarter of the Celtics' March 15 game against Minnesota... the injury was further aggravated during Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals at Washington on May 12.\nThe Celtics were defeated by the Cavaliers in five games in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nThomas finished fifth in the NBA's most valuable player (MVP) voting for the 2016–2017 season.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2017–2018).\nOn August 22, 2017, Thomas was traded, along with Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected 2018 first-round draft pick, to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. However, during the post-trade physical examination by Cleveland staff, concerns were raised about the health of Thomas's previously injured right hip. As a result, eight days after the deal was announced, the Celtics agreed to send the Cavaliers a 2020 second-round draft pick via the Miami Heat to complete the trade. In September 2017, TheAthletic.com reported that Thomas had been playing with a number of secondary issues in his right hip, such as a loss of cartilage and some arthritis, for several seasons. Thomas opted to pursue rehabilitation rather than surgery for the hip because he believed that the lengthy post-surgery recovery period would cause teams to be less willing to offer him large contracts during his upcoming free agency.\nThomas's right hip injury proved to be debilitating, and it damaged his NBA career. The injury prevented him from playing for the Cavaliers until January 2018. Upon his return to the court, he was unable to play as effectively as he had played in earlier seasons. \nOn January 2, 2018, Thomas made his long-awaited debut for the Cavaliers, scoring 17 points in 19 minutes off the bench in a 127–110 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. A day later, Thomas returned to TD Garden. Although he did not play in the Cavaliers' 102–88 loss to the Celtics, Thomas received a standing ovation from the Celtics' fans. On January 6, he had 19 points and four assists in his second appearance and first start of the season in a 131–127 win over the Orlando Magic. On January 20, he scored a season-high 24 points in a 148–124 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Thomas averaged 14.7 points per game for the Cavaliers on 36.1% shooting.\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018).\nOn February 8, 2018, the Cavaliers traded Thomas, Channing Frye and a 2018 first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. In his debut for the Lakers two days later, Thomas scored 22 points off the bench in a 130–123 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. On March 1, he scored a season-high 29 points in a 131–113 win over the Miami Heat. On March 29, he was ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right hip. In 17 games for the Lakers, Thomas averaged 15.6 points per game on 38.3% shooting.\nDenver Nuggets (2018–2019).\nOn July 16, 2018, Thomas signed a one-year deal with the Denver Nuggets for a veteran's minimum contract of $2 million. After his recovery from hip surgery, Thomas made his debut for the Nuggets on February 13, 2019, scoring all eight of his points in the third quarter of Denver's 120–118 win over the Sacramento Kings. It was his first game since March 22, 2018. In the 12 games Thomas played for Denver, he averaged 8.1 points per game on 34.3% shooting.\nWashington Wizards (2019–2020).\nOn July 10, 2019, Thomas signed with the Washington Wizards. Thomas injured his left thumb on September 16 and underwent surgery on September 18. On December 22, Thomas was suspended for two games without pay for entering the stands during a game. In 40 games with the Wizards, Thomas averaged 12.2 points per game on 40.8% shooting and 41.3% shooting from beyond the three-point arc.\nOn February 6, 2020, Thomas was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers as a trade deadline acquisition. He was waived one day later.\nOn May 6, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Thomas underwent right hip resurfacing surgery.

        "text": "Luke Trevor Hughes (born 2 August 1984) is an Australian former professional baseball infielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics and in international competition for the Australia national baseball team. Hughes currently has the most career home runs in the Australian Baseball League upon his retirement following the 2019–20 Australian Baseball League season with 60.\nCareer.\nHughes played the 2001/2002 season in the International Baseball League of Australia, where he was named as the All-Star second baseman.\nHe helped the Perth Heat win the 2003 Claxton Shield with a .429 batting average. He also won the Golden Glove in the 2004 Claxton Shield. He currently plays for the Melbourne Aces in the Australian Baseball League and grew up playing for the Morley Eagles Baseball Club.\nMinnesota Twins.\nHe was then signed to the Minnesota Twins early 2002. He debuted professionally a year later with the GCL Twins, reaching base safely in 19 straight games at one point. He was named to the Gulf Coast League All-Star team at third base.\nIn 2004, he moved to the Elizabethton Twins and played second base.\nAfter two seasons with the New Britain Rock Cats and appearances for the 2007 and 2008 Eastern League All-Star team, he was promoted to AAA with the Rochester Red Wings. He also played in the 2008 All-Star Futures Game and was the only Australian that played for the World team.\nOn April 24, 2010, he was called up to the Minnesota Twins Major League roster as Nick Punto was sent to the DL.\nOn April 28, 2010 he debuted for the Twins at third base. In his first Major League at bat he hit a home run against Detroit Tigers pitcher Max Scherzer. In comparison, hitting a first at bat home run is twice as rare as throwing a no-hitter. Hughes' home run was calculated to have gone 360 feet. He is the 106th person in MLB history to homer in his first major league at-bat dating back to 1855 (less than once per season: .68), and was the 2nd to do so during the 2010 season (the first was Jason Heyward). Six other Twins have homered in their first at-bat: Rick Renick (1968), Dave McKay (1975), Gary Gaetti (1981), Andre David (1984), and Eddie Rosario (2015).\nOakland Athletics.\nOn April 22, 2012, he was claimed off of waivers by the Oakland Athletics to make room on the Twins roster for RHP Jason Marquis. However, 8 days later, Hughes was designated for assignment when Brandon Inge was signed. Hughes was 1–13 in 4 games with Oakland while striking out 6 times. He was released on 17 July.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn August 1, 2012, the Toronto Blue Jays signed Hughes and assigned him to their AAA affiliate Las Vegas 51s, playing 28 games and hitting .314/.392/.543 in his final stint of affiliated baseball.\nLancaster Barnstormers.\nPartway through the 2015 season, Hughes joined the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball and finished out the season with the club, hitting .240/.308/.422 in 78 games with 12 homeruns.\nPerth Heat.\nAfter debuting for the Western Heelers in the 2002 International Baseball League of Australia season being named in the post-season All-Star team at second base as a 17-year-old. With the folding of the privately owned IBLA, the team reverted to the Claxton Shield, where he would hit .429 in 2003. Hughes would continue to have success in the Australian competition, winning a gold glove in 2004 before helping the now rebranded Perth Heat to championships in the 2008 and 2009 Claxton Shields, hitting .439 and five homeruns in the latter, being named in the All Star team at 3B and the Championship MVP.\nIn 2010, the Australian Baseball League was formed and Hughes fresh off his MLB debut was the biggest name on the Heat roster. He hit .337/.448/.616 in the leagues inaugural season, leading the team to a championship. The following season, he only played in 19 games, but hit .344/.500/.656 as the team defended their title, going back to back.\nWith Hughes in the team, the Heat would make three more Championship Series appearances, winning two of them.\nMelbourne Aces.\nFor the 2018–19 Australian Baseball League season, Hughes along with Heat teammate Allan de San Miguel moved to the Melbourne Aces. The Aces were knocked out in the wild card game by the Canberra Cavalry. On the 15th of January, 2020 after 322 games, Hughes announced his retirement. He leads the league in homeruns (59) and runs (217).\nAustralian National Team.\nHughes played for Australia in the 2005 Baseball World Cup where he batted 1 for 15. Again he played in the 2006 World Baseball Classic going 0 from 3. In 2006, he picked up his form in the Intercontinental Cup, the Australian batted .455 and slugged .755. In 5 games at second and four at third, he was error-free.\nHughes hit .333 for Australia in the 2007 Baseball World Cup. Hughes tied a game against the Dutch national team with a 9th-inning sacrifice fly. Against the Venezuela national team, Luke cracked a 3-run homer in the bottom of the 11th to win the game. He broke open a tie game against Team Canada in the top of the 9th with a double and the go-ahead run. America's Jayson Nix beat him out for All-Star honours at second base in the tournament.\nOn February 20, 2018, he was selected exhibition series against Japan.\nOn October 8, 2019, he was selected to the 2019 WBSC Premier12."

        "text": "The East Coast Rowing Council is the regional organisation of Skiff rowing on Ireland's East coast, representing the sport of Coastal and ocean rowing. As per local tradition, coastal rowing is undertaken by crews of four with one sweep oar each, and a coxswain, in wooden clinker-built boats. Formed in 1936, the ECRC has the task of formalising the rules, organising regatta dates and judging any disputes between members. Rules were laid down as to sizes and weights of skiffs to make races fairer. The ECRC represents clubs in the counties of Dublin, Wicklow, and North Wexford.\nEast Coast tradition.\nClinker skiff-type boats were once one of the most numerous type of working boats found along the eastern seaboard of Ireland. They were recorded in 1874 by historian E.W. Holdsworth, where he noted that ‘The smaller boats employed for the line-fishery are of the same style as the Norway yawl, sharp at both ends.’.\nSkiff racing has its origins in the occupation of hobbling. Hobblers were freelance pilots, and competition was strong to be the first to board the approaching ships. Not only did the successful hobblers receive payment to pilot the ships into port but they were also awarded the contract for discharging/loading those ships whilst in port.\nThe skiffs worked mainly between Lambay Island just north of Dublin Bay and Wicklow Head, where they required considerable skill on behalf of the oarsmen. The long tradition of rowing is now carried on through the rowing clubs affiliated to East Coast Rowing Council. These clubs can be found around the old Dublin pilot stations of Ringsend and East Wall in Dublin Port, Dun Laoghaire, Dalkey, Bray, Greystones, Wicklow, Arklow, and Courtown.\nMember clubs.\nThe current members of the ECRC are:\nRacing.\nEach year the ECRC organises a summer schedule of regattas at clubs from Ringsend to Arklow where crews of all ages compete during the regatta. ECRC clubs also regularly compete in the biennial ‘Celtic Challenge’, a race of over 90 miles from Arklow to Aberystwyth in Wales as well as other long distance races such as the annual Ocean to City race in Cork, or the Kish lighthouse row in Dublin. Clubs can be regularly seen training at sea along the East Coast between April and September each year. Present day racing skiffs reflect their traditional origins, and are , clinker built, double-enders.\n2017 events and regattas.\nThe ECRC schedule for 2017 is as follows:-\n2016 events and regattas.\nThe ECRC schedule for 2016 was as follows:-\n2015 events and regattas.\nThe ECRC schedule for 2015 was as follows:-\n2014 events and regattas.\nThe ECRC schedule for 2014 was as follows:-\n2013 events and regattas.\nThe schedule for 2013 (ECRC regattas and significant other regattas) was as follows:-\n2012 events and regattas.\nThe schedule for 2012 (ECRC and non-ECRC events) was as follows:-\n2011 events and regattas.\nThe schedule for 2011 was as follows:-\n2010 events and regattas.\n2010 was an exciting year in the ECRC calendar with the ‘Celtic Challenge’ kicking off the season for a few of the clubs.

        "text": "The 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season marked the continuation of the annual tradition of competitive basketball among Big Ten Conference members that began in 1904. It was the 104th season of Big Ten Conference basketball play. Although during the 2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season there were no Big Ten players named to any All-American teams, no coaches given any national coaching honors, and no teams that won any major preconference tournament, the season was successful for other reasons. The conference had an overall 14–8 record in postseason play with one team reaching for the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament championship game and another winning the championship of the 2009 National Invitation Tournament (NIT).\nThe season marked the second year that all regular season and Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament games were nationally televised. It was the first season that eight member teams achieved 20 wins. During the season, the conference achieved a .781 winning percentage against non-conference opponents, which is the highest percentage since 1998–99.\nMichigan State was the regular season champion winning the league four games. Purdue and Illinois tied for second place. Michigan State's Kalin Lucas was named Big Ten Player of the Year. Michigan State's Tom Izzo was named Coach of the Year by the coaches while Penn State's Ed Dechellis was named Coach of the Year by the media.\nPurdue won the Big Ten tournament by defeating Ohio State in the championship. As a result of its win, Purdue received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. In total, seven teams received bids to the NCAA tournament: Michigan State, Purdue, Illinois, Ohio State, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. By placing 7 of its 11 teams in the tournament, it had 64% of its teams in the tournament, which outpaced all other conferences. Both Michigan State and Purdue advanced to the second weekend's Sweet Sixteen round, where Purdue lost to Connecticut. Michigan State advanced to the championship game where it lost to North Carolina 89–72.\nThe Big Ten also had two entrants in the 2009 NIT: Penn State and Northwestern with Penn State winning the tournament.\nPreseason.\nAll-Big Ten players.\nOn October 26, the Big Ten media selected Purdue as the preseason top team. It selected Michigan State and Wisconsin as second and third respectively. However, the November 10 national AP Poll and Coaches' Poll ranked Michigan State as the highest among Big Ten teams with Purdue second and Wisconsin third in their respective preseason 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings.\nThe media also made preseason All-Big Ten player selections: Manny Harris, sophomore guard from Michigan, Raymar Morgan, junior forward from Michigan State, Marcus Landry, senior forward from Wisconsin, E'Twaun Moore, sophomore guard from Purdue, and Robbie Hummel, sophomore forward from Purdue, who was named Preseason Player of the Year.\nThe Los Angeles Athletic Club released its annual preseason John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 13. The list was composed of 50 student athletes who, based on 2007–08's individual performance and team records, were the early frontrunners for college basketball's most coveted trophy. These top 50 candidates were returning players. Transfers, freshmen, and medical red-shirts were not eligible for this preseason list, but were evaluated and considered for both the Midseason Top 30 list and the National Ballot. The Big Ten was represented by Purdue's Hummel, Wisconsin's Landry and Michigan State's Morgan.\nOn December 18, the Atlanta Tipoff Club released its annual early season Naismith College Player of the Year award watch list. The top-50 list included Hummel, Moore and Morgan. The watch list does not include incoming freshmen, although those student-athletes were considered in the February 2009 mid season vote.\nRegular season.\nThe Big Ten began the season anticipating competitive schedules since the conference had scheduled appearances against thirteen of the teams appearing in both of the major pre-season rankings. The conference opened its first week with a 14–0 record, while holding all 14 opponents to 65 points or less. By the end of the second week of the season the Big Ten found itself with the best non-conference record in the nation at 35–1. They became the first power conference (ACC, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, Pac-10 or SEC) to have a road win against another of the conferences when Illinois bested Vanderbilt on November 20. On the same date, Michigan achieved the conference's first victory against a top five opponent since Michigan State upended Texas on December 22, 2007. Big Ten teams did not win any of the larger preconference tournaments: Purdue lost in overtime of the November 28 championship game of the 16-team 2008 NIT Season Tip-Off tournament, Michigan placed second in the 16-team 2K Sports Classic benefiting Coaches vs. Cancer tournament on November 21, and Wisconsin was runner up in the 8-team Paradise Jam Tournament on November 24. Minnesota, was successful in the 4-team National Association of Basketball Coaches Classic with a win over Georgia State Panthers in the championship game.\nOn Wednesday, December 3, The Big Ten lost to the Atlantic Coast Conference for the 10th consecutive year in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge. The final margin was 6–5. By the end of the fourth week of the season in early December, the Big Ten had the highest percentage of teams receiving votes in the Associated Press National Rankings and had the highest non-conference strength of schedule in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). Minnesota's 8–0 start was Tubby Smith's first. After five weeks, the Big Ten had the maintained its AP rankings leadership, but also took over the overall leadership in the RPI ratings. The conference's 82–19 record included only losses to teams that had advanced to the post-season the year before. Michigan State's win against Texas gave the Big Ten half of the nation's first six victories over top five teams. National Invitation Tournament defending champion, Ohio State's eighth victory gave them the nation's longest win streak at thirteen. Entering conference play, at 12–0 Minnesota remained one of the nine unbeaten teams in the nation, which was its best start since 1948–49. The conference had one of three winning conference records on the road against non-conference opponents at 10–8 and with 5 of its 11 teams ranked in the AP poll, it had the highest percentage of its teams ranked.\nFor the first time since freshmen became eligible in 1974, Indiana started four freshmen in a conference opener on January 3 against Iowa. On January 11, Minnesota tied an NCAA record and set a conference record by making all nine of its three-point field goals. Illinois' January 14 victory over Michigan made it the thirteenth team in NCAA Division I history and second (after Indiana) in the Big Ten to achieve 1600 wins. On January 21, Northwestern snapped the third-longest home-court winning streak in the nation when it stopped Michigan State from earning its 29th straight home victory. John Beilein recorded his 500th win as head coach of a four-year school and 575th win overall on January 24 against Northwestern. As January ended, the conference enjoyed its fourth consecutive week as the leader in the RPI strength of schedule. On January 31, Matt Roth became the first Indiana Hoosier, first Big Ten freshman and third Big Ten player to record nine three-point shots in a single game.\nAt the midpoint of the conference schedule at the beginning of February, the Big Ten had the highest Sagarin Rating central mean score. Previously, Michigan State had never won its first five conference road games since joining the Big Ten for the 1950–51 season, but during the season, they were one of the last two teams to be undefeated on the road at 7–0. Tubby Smith became the third coach in NCAA history to record 20 wins during 16 consecutive seasons. Through its 166th contest, the Big Ten, which had led the nation in average attendance for the prior 32 years, surpassed two million in attendance for the sixteenth consecutive season and eighteenth overall.\nAttendance.\nThe big ten concluded the season with the highest attendance in the nation for the 33rd straight season with an average attendance of 12,519 fans per game/session, including regular-season games and conference tournament sessions. This surpassed the SEC, which was second with an 11,625 average. The Big Ten held seven of the top 25 places among individual institutions, while no other conference had more than four individual schools among the top 25.\nRankings.\n^Final Poll = ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll\nPreconference schedules.\nTournaments.\nNo Big Ten teams won any major early conference tournaments.\nIn-season honors.\nThroughout the conference regular season, the Big Ten offices named a player of the week each Monday.\nOn February 5, the Big Ten became one of six conferences to have multiple players selected as John R. Wooden Award 2008–09 Midseason Top 30 Candidates. Both Manny Harris and Kalin Lucas were chosen. On February 24, Hummel became the only Big Ten player included in the Naismith midseason Top 30. On February 26, Turner became the only Big Ten player selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association as a Top 15 finalist for the Oscar Robertson Trophy.\nConference honors.\nTwo sets of conference award winners were recognized by the Big Ten - one selected by league coaches and one selected by the media.\nAll-Big Ten Academic team.\nThe Big Ten Conference had 40 men's basketball letterwinners who were in at least their second academic year at their institution and who maintained a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher during the winter semester to earn Big Ten Academic All-Conference honors.

In the off-season, there are informal box lacrosse and sofcrosse competitions, though the majority of players in Australia are foremostly of the field lacrosse type. Some lacrosse is also played in Sydney, Brisbane and Hobart, although it is very much at the developmental level.\nUntil 2007, men's and women's lacrosse were administered by separate governing bodies (Lacrosse Australia and Women's Lacrosse Australia). These organisations merged in 2007 to form the Australian Lacrosse Association (ALA). In 2021 the ALA rebranded as Lacrosse Australia and remains the single governing body for all formats of lacrosse in Australia.\nStructure.\nThe national body has six state member associations:"

        "title": "Rugby union in India",
        "text": "Rugby union in India is a minor sport. However, it is a fast-growing sport as some Indian sporting clubs are beginning to embrace the game. Rugby union was the second most popular winter sport after association football in India, but now it is played in the shadow of the football team. \nIndia is World Rugby Rankings rated 77th in the rugby playing nations as of May 2016. The IRFU has 24,010 registered players, 7,160 of whom are female. This is their highest ranking ever. India is the current Division 3 South-Central title holder in the Asia Rugby Championship.\nThe governing body is Rugby India.\nHistory.\nPre-history.\nIndia, like many other countries, had a few forms of folk football. Most of these have died out, but a Manipuri game, \"yubi lakpi\" is still played in the East of India. Emma Levine, an English writer on little-known Asian sports, speculates:\nHowever, traditional football games can be found in many parts of the world, e.g. marn grook in Australia, cuju in China and calcio Fiorentino in Italy and Levine provides no documentary or material evidence of its antiquity.\nBritish India.\nLike other sports founded in England and brought to India during the British Rule such as cricket, rugby union has a long history in India. The earliest trace of Rugby Football in India dates back to a scratch match or two played in Calcutta and Madras during the visit of H.M.S. Galatea in 1871. The teak goal posts used on the occasion of the Calcutta Match were afterward used by the C.F.C. up to at least 1886.\nThe first recorded match was played on Christmas Day 1872, at CFC in Calcutta, it was played between England and a combined team of Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The game caught on and had to be repeated within the week.\nThe game was now established. In January 1873, officers were appointed and the Club Rolls gave a total of 137 members. The Club colours were chosen as red and white, broad stripes.\nFrom then on, rugby in India, lingered on at a very low key. Part of the reason for this was that the British preferred to play apart from their colonial subjects, leading to a low take up by the local population. Another reason was the climate, which meant that games would frequently have to be played in the evenings or early morning, which meant that it was not too popular with the colonists themselves.\n20th and 21st Centuries.\nAt its lowest ebb, in the 1980s, the Indian RFU was being run out of the Irish Consulate at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club's chambers. However, a fairly successful campaign in the 1990s put the game back on its feet.\nIndian delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986.\nThere are 57,000 registered players in the country and India are ranked 65th out of 96 nations in the IRB (International Rugby Board) world rankings. The home of rugby in India is considered to be Kolkata.\nCalcutta Cup.\nOn Christmas Day 1872, a game of rugby, between 20 players representing England on the one side and 20 representing Scotland, Ireland and Wales on the other, was played in Calcutta.\nThe match was such a success that it was repeated a week later — the game of rugby had reached India. These lovers of rugby wanted to form a club in the area and the aforementioned matches were the agents which led to the formation of the Calcutta Football Club in January 1873.\nThe Calcutta Club joined the Rugby Football Union in 1874. Despite the Indian climate not being entirely suitable for playing rugby, the club prospered during that first year. However, when the free bar had to be discontinued, the membership took an appreciable drop. Other sports, such as tennis and polo, which were considered to be more suited to the local climate, were making inroads into the numbers of players available.\nIn 1877 the game declined and almost died out, leaving behind a full coffer. The wise G.A.J. Rothney, who had been acting as Captain, Hon. Secretary and Treasurer of the Club at that time, proposed that the funds should be devoted to the purchase of a cup of Indian workmanship to be offered to the Rugby Football Union- the parent body of the game worldwide. The withdrawal of these monies was done in the form of silver coins which were then melted to craft the exquisite Calcutta Cup.\nThe members decided to disband but keen to perpetuate the name of the club, they withdrew the club's funds from the bank; which were in Silver Rupees, had them melted down and made into a cup which they presented to the RFU in 1878, with the provision that it should be competed for annually.\nThe cup is of Indian workmanship, approximately 18 inches (45 cm) high, the body is finely engraved with three king cobras forming the handles. The domed lid is surmounted by an elephant which is, it is said, copied from the Viceroy's own stock and is complete with a howdah. The inscription on the Cup's wooden base reads: \"THE CALCUTTA CUP\".\nThis historical legacy has not been universally well-received, in fact, Sean Smith, whose book \"The Union Game: A Rugby History\" accompanied the BBC TV series of the same name, has said of it that:\nThe other Calcutta Cup.\nIn 1884 Calcutta Cricket and Football Club (CC&amp;FC) again set up a rugby section and in 1890 set up an inter club trophy, the Calcutta Rugby Union Challenge Cup, promptly christened the Calcutta Cup.\nThe cup is held by Jungle Crows who beat CC&amp;FC. The second division trophy was won by Calcutta Cricket and Football Club Panthers.\nAll India and South Asia Rugby Tournament.\nThe All India and South Asia Rugby Tournament is an amateur league competition for rugby union football clubs in India. The competition has been played since 1924. In 2016 12 team took part in the tournament and Army Red were the champions. For the first time women will be participating in the Rugby XVs, there were 6 teams.\n2010 Commonwealth Games - Delhi, India.\nIndia is an active participant in the Commonwealth Sevens, and the 2010 Commonwealth Games, held in Delhi featured the sport.\nNational teams.\nIn June 2019, the Indian women's registered their first victory in only their third-ever international match, when they defeated Singapore in the 2019 Asia Rugby Women's Championship. Team member Sweety Kumari, who was in excellent form during the tournament was declared as the 'International Young Player Of The Year' by Scrumqueens magazine."

        "text": "Dale Roberts (April 12, 1940 – October 8, 2010) was an American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees in the 1967 season. Listed at , , Roberts batted right-handed and threw left-handed. He was nicknamed \"Mountain Man\".\nEarly life.\nBorn in Owenton, Kentucky, Roberts was the son of Clarence A. and Julie E. Roberts (née Etherington). After graduating from Versailles High School, he served in the United States Naval Air Forces to a term of four and a half years.\nCareer.\nRoberts was signed by the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1963, and initially assigned to the Harlan Yankees of the Appalachian League, a Rookie-class league. After pitching in 21 games, all but one as a relief pitcher, and a 4–3 record, he was promoted to the Shelby Colonels/Yankees of the class-A Western Carolinas League, and pitched in an additional two games, both of which he was credited with the loss. In 1964, he remained with the Shelby team, and pitched in 47 games while having a 3.53 ERA. For the 1965 season, he was assigned to the Binghamton Triplets of the class-A New York – Penn League. In 112 innings pitched in 45 appearances, he had a 6–4 record and a 3.21 ERA.\nIn 1966, Roberts was transferred to another class-A team, the Greensboro Yankees of the Carolina League. After appearing in 35 games for Greensboro, and having a 6–4 record and a 2.21 ERA, he was promoted the class-AAA Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Yankees switched affiliations for the 1967 season from the Mud Hens to the Syracuse Chiefs, also of the International League, and Roberts moved as well. For Syracuse, he had a 9–4 record and 2.97 ERA in 50 games pitched, when he was a late-season call-up by the Yankees to their Major League club. He appeared in two games for the Yankees; the first one occurred on September 9, when he pitched the final inning in a 7–1 loss to the Boston Red Sox, allowing one run on two hits and one base on balls. His second and last Major League appearance occurred on September 16, when he pitched the eighth inning in a 6–1 loss against the Cleveland Indians, and gave up one run on one hit, one intentional base on balls, and two hit batters. Roberts did not appear in another game for the Yankees, who traded him on December 7, 1967, along with Bob Tillman, to the Atlanta Braves for Bobby Cox.\nHis first assignment in the Braves organization began with the Shreveport Braves, a class-AA team in the Texas League. Toward the end of the season, Roberts was promoted to the Braves' class-AAA team, the Richmond Braves of the International League, and had a 1.93 ERA in eight appearances. He returned to Shreveport in 1969, and played the entire season with the club, appeared in 61 games, had a 2.29 ERA, and collected 14 saves. In 1970, his last season in professional baseball, Roberts began the season in Shreveport, made 33 appearances, and while his ERA was a low 2.80, he was moved to the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), the class-AAA affiliate of the California Angels. He played in four games with the Islanders before being moved again, landing with the Eugene Emeralds, also of the PCL. He retired after when the season was completed.\nPersonal life.\nAfter his playing days, Roberts worked as an industrial electrician for several companies, including Texas Instruments and Osram Sylvania. On October 8, 2010, he died in Lexington, Kentucky, aged 70, at Chandler Medical Center located on the campus of University of Kentucky. He was survived by a daughter, two granddaughters, three brothers, and a sister."

The race began on 15 May in Milan with a stage that stretched to Turin, finishing back in Milan on 6 June after a stage and a total distance covered of . The race was won by Alfredo Binda of the Legnano team. Second and third respectively were the Italian riders Giovanni Brunero and Antonio Negrini.\n266 riders started the race, and 80 crossed the finish line of the final stage.\nIt was the first Giro with a modern design: in the same period of time of the previous Giro, three more stages were included, which replaced three days of rest. At the same time the stages became shorter (only one passed 300 km).\nIn 1927 Binda was at the apex of its career, and it triumphed winning 12 stages out of 15: a record still to be surpassed. Binda led the general classification from the first to the last stage (only Girardengo had already done it, in the 1919 Giro). In Binda's team there was also his brother Albino, as a support rider.\nGiovanni Rossignoli, \"virtual\" winner of the first edition in 1909, participated for the last time. He was 45 years old and concluded the race in 44th place, about 7 hours behind Binda.\nParticipants.\nOf the 266 riders that began the Giro d'Italia on 15 May, 80 of them made it to the finish in Milan on 6 June. Riders were allowed to ride on their own or as a member of a team. There were six teams that competed in the race: Aliprandi-Pirelli, Bianchi-Pirelli, Berettini-Hutchinson, Ganna-Dunlop, Legnano-Pirelli, and Wolsit-Pirelli.\nThe peloton was primarily composed of Italians. The field featured three former Giro d'Italia champions in three-time winner and reigning champion Giovanni Brunero, along with one-time winners Alfredo Binda and Giuseppe Enrici. Other notable Italian riders that started the race included Arturo Bresciani, Giovanni Rossignoli, and Domenico Piemontesi.\nAmong the starters was Luigi Ferri, almost fifty years old. Ferri is the oldest known rider to participate in the Giro, but did not finish the first stage.\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nThere were 80 cyclists who had completed all fifteen stages. For these cyclists, the times they had needed in each stage was added up for the general classification. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the winner. Aristide Cavallini won the prize for best ranked independent rider in the general classification."

        "text": "This is a list of the complete squads for the 2009 Six Nations Championship, an annual rugby union tournament contested by the national rugby teams of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, and Wales. Each country was entitled to name a squad of 39 players to contest the championship. They could also invite additional players along prior to the start of the championship while the coach could call up replacement players if squad members suffered serious injury.\n\"All caps are as of the start of the tournament, and do not include appearances made during the competition.\"\nEngland.\nEngland announced their 32-man squad for the 2009 Six Nations on 14 January 2009, including both Tom Palmer, who missed the entire tournament with a shoulder injury, and Tom Rees, who was ruled out of the first three games with knee trouble. Prop Matt Stevens was replaced in the squad by Julian White after Stevens was found to have taken a banned substance. Flanker Lewis Moody broke his ankle while training with his club, Leicester Tigers, and was replaced in the England squad by Steffon Armitage, brother of fullback Delon Armitage. Andy Goode, Joe Worsley and Paul Hodgson were all called up to train with the squad and went on to take part in the tournament, while Louis Deacon and Olly Barkley replaced the injured Tom Palmer and Shane Geraghty.\nHead coach: Martin Johnson\nFrance.\nFrance named their final 23-man squad for the Six Nations on 28 January. Eight players from their training squad lost their places in the final 23, with only Biarritz number 8 Imanol Harinordoquy being brought in from outside the original 30.\nAs cover for prop Lionel Faure, who was nursing an injured calf, Clermont Auvergne's Thomas Domingo was called up to the squad on 11 February. Maxime Mermoz was called up in place of the banned Florian Fritz. Renaud Boyoud was also drafted in place of the injured Benoît Lecouls. Mathieu Bastareaud was called up for the injured Lionel Beauxis with Benoît Baby moving to fly-half, while Sylvain Marconnet was brought into the squad after injuries to both Benoît Lecouls and Nicolas Mas. François Trinh-Duc was also called up as specialist fly-half cover. On 4 March Jérôme Thion, Julien Bonnaire and Damien Traille were all added to the squad, while Sébastien Chabal shifted from lock to the back row. For their final game against Italy, France called up William Servat and Frédéric Michalak to replace Benjamin Kayser who had a neck injury and Sébastien Tillous-Borde who withdrew with a biceps problem.\nHead coach: Marc Lièvremont\nIreland.\nIreland named their squad for the 2009 Six Nations on 21 January 2009. Included in the 39-man squad were seven uncapped players, as well as inside centre Gordon D'Arcy, who had only returned in December from a broken arm picked up in the opening game of the 2008 Six Nations.\nHead coach: Declan Kidney\nItaly.\nItaly's squad for the Six Nations, named on 29 January 2009 by Nick Mallett:\nItaly lost both of their specialist scrum-halves, Simon Picone and Pietro Travagli, for the entire Six Nations due to injury. Pablo Canavosio was called up but failed to recover from a knee injury in time for Italy's opener. This led head coach Nick Mallett to make a move he had been contemplating even before Canavosio's withdrawal – shifting Mauro Bergamasco from flanker to scrum-half.\nAfter Bergamasco's poor performance at scrum-half in the opener against England, in which his mistakes directly led to three of England's five tries, Mallett recalled Paul Griffen to play scrum-half and moved Bergamasco back to his normal flanker position. Carlo Del Fava was also brought in as an experienced second row forward. Leonardo Ghiraldini was called up after he recovered from injury but Fabio Ongaro was ruled out, so Franco Sbaraglini was also called up. On 3 March, Mallett added several players to the squad. Coming in were Fabio Staibano, Simone Favaro, Kris Burton and Michele Sepe. After returning from his suspension Andrea Masi picked up a back injury, Luciano Orquera was brought into the squad as cover.\nHead coach: Nick Mallett\nScotland.\nScotland named a 33-man squad for the 2009 Six Nations on 20 January 2009, and included uncapped prop Geoff Cross and fly-half Ruaridh Jackson. However, after injuries and illness hit the squad, a further five players were added to train on 30 January. After injuries to Geoff Cross and the Allan Jacobsen, Moray Low was called into the main squad to provide cover for the final two games. Following a return to fitness Rory Lamont was called up to the squad, but the game against Ireland came to soon for him.\nHead coach: Frank Hadden\nWales.\nWales announced their squad for the 2009 Six Nations on 19 January 2009, naming a group of 28 players. Following a knee injury to scrum-half Gareth Cooper in training, head coach Warren Gatland opted to call 64-cap Sale Sharks scrum-half Dwayne Peel into the squad. After Dwayne Peel had also been ruled out with injury, Gatland was forced to call up London Irish scrum-half Warren Fury for bench cover.\nHead coach: Warren Gatland"

This was the first time in over seven years, since the first round of the 2003 Masters, where neither Woods nor Mickelson made a birdie in a round of a major championship.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 18, 2010\"\nMcDowell shot a 68 (−3) to take the 36-hole lead at 139 (−3). Casey posted a 73 (+2) to move back to even par, as did de Jonge. Shaun Micheel shot a 77 (+6), with a double-hit on a chip shot on the first hole. Woods continued to struggle, with a 72 (+1) for 146 (+4). Among those at 141 (−1) were Ernie Els, Johnson, Ishikawa, and Mickelson. Mickelson shot 66 (−5) with a front nine charge with birdies at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Notable players who missed the cut (+7) were Rory McIlroy, Hunter Mahan, and two-time heart transplant survivor Erik Compton, who was playing in his first major.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 19, 2010\"\nJohnson stormed to five-under 66 for a 207 (−6) and a three shot lead over McDowell at 210. Johnson eagled the drivable fourth hole to go with birdies on 17 and 18. Woods shot a back nine 31, with birdies on the last three holes to get back in contention in solo third place at 212 (−1). Both Grégory Havret and Els finished at even par, six shots back of Johnson. Mickelson double bogeyed the 9th hole and struggled to a 73 (+2).\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 20, 2010\"\nOvernight leader Johnson quickly dropped out of contention with a triple-bogey on the second hole and a double on the third hole. Els was tied for the lead at a part of the round, but fell back eventually. Havret remained closely in contention, but McDowell ground out a round of 74 to win his first major championship.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

He was capped twice for Wales and was part of the Welsh team that faced the first overseas tourists, the New Zealand Natives.\nRugby career.\nTowers originally played rugby for local club Hartlepool Rovers, and represented his county side, Durham. After moving to Wales, Towers switched to first-class Welsh team Swansea. It was while playing for Swansea that Towers was first selected to play for Wales in a game against Ireland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Towers was one of two new caps on the day, the other being Llanelli's John Goulstone Lewis. Under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, Wales beat the Irish team even though Ireland outscored Wales three tries to one; a peculiarity of the scoring system of the time.\nIn 1888 Towers, now captain of the Swansea senior team, gained his second and final international cap when he was chosen to face the touring New Zealand Natives. Although certain members of the Welsh team received a hostile reception from the St. Helen's crowd, Wales played well; with Towers scoring a try which Jim Webb converted. The Welsh managed another two tries without reply, for a memorable win. Two days later, on Christmas Eve, Towers faced the same New Zealand side as he led out the Swansea team against the tourists. In heavy rain, Swansea lost the match with the press criticising the Swansea players for complacency. During the same tour, Towers refereed the match between the New Zealand natives and Llanelli three days before the Welsh match, which Llanelli won thanks to a Harry Bowen dropped goal.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

        "title": "Swimming at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre freestyle",
        "text": "The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place on 18–19 September at the Olympic Park Swimming Pool in Seoul, South Korea. There were 63 competitors from 41 nations, with each nation having up to two swimmers.\nAustralia's Duncan Armstrong set a new world record to win the Olympic title in the event. Swimming in lane six and coming from third at the final turn, he edged out a vastly experienced field for the gold medal in 1:47.25. His time also sliced 0.19 seconds off the global standard set by West Germany's Michael Gross at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nSweden's Anders Holmertz overtook U.S. swimmer Matt Biondi about midway through the final stretch, but could not catch Armstrong near the wall to finish with a silver in 1:47.89. It was Sweden's first medal in the men's 200 metre freestyle. Leading almost the entire race, Biondi faded down the stretch to break the 1:48 barrier and take the bronze at 1:47.99.\nPoland's Artur Wojdat, a top qualifier on the morning preliminaries, dropped off the podium to a fourth-place time in 1:48.40. Meanwhile, Gross missed a chance to defend his Olympic title with a fifth-place finish in 1:48.59.\nBackground.\nThis was the eighth appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.\nTwo of the 8 finalists from the 1984 Games returned: gold medalist Michael Gross and bronze medalist Thomas Fahrner, both of West Germany. Gross was the two-time reigning World Champion as well, with wins in the 1982 and 1986 World Aquatics Championships. American Matt Biondi had taken bronze at the 1986 World Championships; he was a strong challenger even though his best races were at 100 metres. 1987 European champion Anders Holmertz of Sweden was also among the podium favourites; Duncan Armstrong of Australia was not a pre-race favourite.\nBelgium, Guam, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates each made their debut in the event. Australia made its eighth appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used a two-round (heats, final) format. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer's place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. There were 8 heats of up to 8 swimmers each. The top 8 swimmers advanced to the final. The 1984 event had also introduced a consolation or \"B\" final; the swimmers placing 9th through 16th in the heats competed in this \"B\" final for placing. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.\nThis swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.\nRecords.\nPrior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.\nThe following records were established during the competition:\nResults.\nHeats.\nRule: The eight fastest swimmers advance to final A (Q), while the next eight to final B (q).\nFinals.\nThere were two finals, one for the top 8 swimmers and one for the next 8 (9th through 16th)."

Both of the events took place at The Aviation Club Tennis Centre in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The women's tournament took place from 15 to 21 February 2009, while the men's tournament took place\nfrom 23 to 28 February 2009.\nThe men's draw was led by only 3 of the world's Top 10 men: ATP No. 3 Novak Djokovic, Doha, Rotterdam champion Andy Murray and ATP No. 8 Gilles Simon.\nAustralian Open runner-up and four-time champion Roger Federer was scheduled to take part, however he was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to a back injury. ATP No. 1, Rotterdam finalist, 2006 titlist &amp; recent Australian Open champion Rafael Nadal was also due to compete but was also forced to withdraw from the event due to a knee injury sustained at the previous event in Rotterdam. Defending champion Andy Roddick withdrew from the event due to the Shahar Pe'er incident and chose not to defend his title as a protest. Nikolay Davydenko and Fernando Verdasco were also scheduled to play but withdrew due to injuries.\nIn the women's event, nine of the ten highest ranked players participated. The top four seeds were Serena Williams, the 2009 Australian Open champion, Dinara Safina, the 2009 Australian Open runner-up, Jelena Janković, a former World No. 1, and Elena Dementieva, the runner-up at the recent Open GDF SUEZ tournament in Paris. Also in the field were Vera Zvonareva, a 2009 Australian Open semifinalist and winner of the recent Pattaya Women's Open, Venus Williams, the reigning Wimbledon champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova, and Ana Ivanovic.\nShahar Pe'er controversy.\nThe tournament became embroiled in controversy when the Dubai government refused to grant a visa to Israeli player Shahar Pe'er, denying her the ability to take part in the 2009 Dubai Tennis Championships. The refusal to allow Pe'er to participate drew immense criticism from top seed players. WTA chief executive Larry Scott said the women's tour was \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision. \"Ms. Pe'er has earned the right to play in the tournament and it's regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right\", he said. \"Ms. Peer and her family are obviously extremely upset and disappointed by the decision of the UAE and its impact on her personally and professionally.\" Scott said the WTA would \"review appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament\". In reaction to the move, the Tennis Channel decided not to televise the event, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" dropped its sponsorship. In response to the move by the UAE, the Dubai Tennis Championship was fined a record US$300,000. Pe'er was awarded US$44,250, an amount equal to the average prize money she earned per tournament in 2008. A number of highly ranked tennis players, including 2008 winner Andy Roddick, pulled out of the men's ATP tournament in Dubai in protest. Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal also pulled out of the tournament, although they both cited injury as their reason for withdrawal, not the incident involving Pe'er. The WTA Tour Board also demanded that Dubai organizers confirm that qualifying Israeli players will get visas at least eight weeks in advance for the 2010 event. \nFinals.\nMen's singles.\n Novak Djokovic defeated David Ferrer 7–5, 6–3\nWomen's singles.\n Venus Williams defeated Virginie Razzano 6–4, 6–2\nMen's doubles.\n Rik de Voest / Dmitry Tursunov defeated Martin Damm / Robert Lindstedt 4–6, 6–3, [10–5]\nWomen's doubles.\n Cara Black / Liezel Huber defeated Maria Kirilenko / Agnieszka Radwańska 6–3, 6–3\nWTA entrants.\nOther entrants.\nThe following players received wildcards into the main draw:\nThe following players received entry from the qualifying draw:\nThe following players received the lucky loser spots:\nATP entrants.\nOther entrants.\nThe following players received wildcards into the main draw:\nThe following players received entry from the qualifying draw:\nThe following player received the lucky loser spot:"

        "title": "Major League Baseball postseason",
        "text": "The Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason is the annual playoff tournament held to determine the champion of MLB in the United States and Canada. Starting in 2022, the playoffs for each league—American and National—consist of two best-of-three Wild Card Series contested by the lowest-seeded division winner and the three wild card teams, two best-of-five Division Series (LDS) featuring the wild-card winners and the two highest-seeded division winners, and finally the best-of-seven League Championship Series (LCS). The winners of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) and the National League Championship Series (NLCS) play each other in the best-of-seven World Series. Under this system, the postseason comprises 32 to 53 games. The postseason tournament takes place after the conclusion of MLB's regular season and takes approximately one month to complete.\nFormat history.\n1903–1968: World Series only.\nMajor League Baseball is the oldest of North America's major professional sports organizations, with roots dating back to the 1870s. The final series to determine its champion has been called the \"World Series\" (originally \"World's Championship Series\" and then \"World's Series\") as far back as the National League's contests with the American Association starting at the beginning of the 1880s.\nFrom 1901 to 1968, each league champion, or pennant winner, was the team with the best regular-season win–loss record. In 1903, modern annual postseason play began with a one-round system, in which the American League champion played the National League champion in a best-of-seven series (in 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921, it was best-of-nine) called the World Series; however, there was no 1904 Series because the National League champion New York Giants refused to play. This single-tiered approach persisted through 1968, even after both leagues expanded in 1961–1962 to ten teams.\n1969–1993: Two rounds.\nIn 1969, both leagues expanded to 12 teams, complicating the competition for the league championship. Prior to 1969, each team played opposing clubs in its own region of the country more than clubs in the rest of the country, creating an unbalanced schedule that in some years could give a team from one region an advantage in fighting for the league pennant. To remedy this, and imitating the other major sports' long-standing playoff traditions, MLB split each league into East and West divisions, creating four divisions of six teams each until expansions in 1977 and 1993. This created a new postseason round called the League Championship Series (LCS), in which the East and West division champions of each league played a best-of-five series to determine the league champion. In 1985, the LCS was expanded to a best-of-seven series, which continues today.\nUnder this system, it was possible for one of the best teams in a league to be left out of the postseason if it failed to win its division. Most notably, in , the Atlanta Braves and San Francisco Giants finished with the two best records in MLB with 104 and 103 wins, respectively. However, since both teams played in the National League West division, the Giants missed the postseason by a single game.\nThe baseball players' strike of 1981 uniquely—for this era—added another round to the postseason. Because the strike split the season into two roughly equal halves, the division winners of each half of the 1981 season met in a best-of-five division series. The winners of the division series then progressed to the league championship series, with the remainder of the postseason following a similar format to other years in this era.\n1994–2011: Three rounds.\nIn 1994, MLB realigned, adding a Central division to both leagues while retaining the pre-existing East and West divisions. To avoid having a playoff tournament consisting of an odd number of divisional winners, a wild card playoff spot was introduced to each league, imitating the original post-merger NFL system. The wild card berth was given to the team with the best record among the division runners-up. This assured that the team with the second-best record in its league qualified for the postseason even if it did not win its division, avoiding cases such as that of the 1993 San Francisco Giants discussed above. This new format doubled the postseason participants in each league from two to four, and from four teams overall to eight.\nThe additional teams made another elimination round necessary. This new round became the new first round of the postseason, the best-of-five Division Series. As mentioned above, this term had first been used for the extra round in 1981 required by the \"split-season\" scheduling anomaly following the midseason baseball players strike; with this playoff expansion, the Division Series became permanent. This format was in place for the 1994 season, but that year's players' strike canceled the postseason. The format was realized on the field in 1995.\nUnder this format, in the two Division Series, the wild card team played the divisional champion outside its own division that had the better record, with the remaining two teams playing each other in the second Division Series for each league. The two Division Series winners from each league go on to play each other in the League Championship Series. As with the previous postseason format, the winners of each League Championship Series met in the World Series.\n2012–2019; 2021: Expanded Wild Card.\nWith the adoption of the new collective bargaining agreement in November 2011, baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced that a new playoff system would begin within two years; the change was ultimately put into place in 2012. The format employed a one-game wild-card playoff.\nUnder this format, a second wild-card team was added to each league, the team with the second-highest win total in each league among non-division winners. The two wild-card teams played in a one-game playoff after the end of the regular season, with the winner advancing to the best-of-five Division Series. As in the previous format, the division champions qualified for the Division Series; however, under the expanded wild-card format, the winner of the Wild Card Game played the division winner with the best record in the Division Series, regardless of whether the two teams were in the same division, while the other two division winners played each other in the other Division Series, with the second-best division winner having home-field advantage. The format for placement in the League Championship Series and World Series remained unchanged.\nWith this format, it was possible for two teams in the same division to play each other before the League Championship Series, provided that one team possessed the best record in its league.\n2020: 16-team Wild Card round.\nDuring the suspension of the 2020 MLB season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all proposals put forward during negotiations between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) included a temporarily expanded postseason. The various proposals included 16-team formats and included the 2020 and (in some proposals) 2021 seasons. However, the eventual lack of a negotiated season structure initially resulted in the 2020 season being intended to keep the 10-team format.\nOn July 23, 2020, MLBPA and the owners agreed to expand to a 16-team playoff structure for the 2020 season. The first round was called the Wild Card Series. The format consisted of eight teams from each league, seeded in the following order: division winners by record (1–3), runner-up teams by record (4–6), and the two best teams remaining (7–8). All games in this format were a best-of-three hosted by the higher seeds. All other series (LDS, LCS, and World Series) remained the same. The WCS pairings were as follows: top seed vs. eighth, second vs. seventh, third vs. sixth, and fourth vs. fifth. The DS had the 1/8 winner play the 4/5 winner, while the 2/7 winner played the 3/6 winner. This format was only used for that particular season as MLB reverted to the previous 10-team setup for the 2021 postseason.\n2022-Present: 12-team Wild Card round.\nIn the 2022 collective bargaining negotiations, owners and players agreed to a 12-team postseason, with 6 teams per league: the three division winners and three wild card teams.\nSeedings for the six teams are as follows:\nThis new postseason format was implemented starting with the season. The two division winners with the best record in each league receive byes to the Division Series. The third place division winner and the three wild card teams are each seeded from three to six in order of their regular season record. These three wild card teams along with the third-place division winner then play in the Wild Card Round, a best-of-three-game series in which the third-seeded division winner hosts the sixth-seeded wild card team and the fourth-seeded wild card team hosts the fifth-seeded wild card team for all three games. The tie-breaker game (a.k.a. \"Game 163\") was also eliminated with playoff spots now determined through tie-breaker formulas.\nThe tiebreakers, consistent for both seeding and playoff qualification, are as follows:\nIf the tie cannot be broken through these means, the last tiebreaker is expanded to include the game before the last half of intra-league games, then two games before, continuing in this pattern until the tie is resolved. \nThe brackets remain fixed, with no re-seeding. In the Division Series, the 1 seed play the 4/5 winner, while the 2 seed plays the 3/6 winner.\nHome-field advantage.\nWorld Series.\nThe World Series used several different formats in its early years. Initially, it generally followed an alternating home-and-away pattern, except that if a seventh game was possible, its site was determined by coin toss prior to the sixth game. In 1924, the World Series began using a 2-3-2 format, presumably to save on travel costs, a pattern that has continued to this day with the exception of a couple of the World War II years when wartime travel restrictions compelled a 3-4 format (used in 1943 and 1945, but not in the 1944 series, which was contested between crosstown rivals the St. Louis Browns and St. Louis Cardinals; all games were held in the same stadium in St. Louis). From the start of the 2-3-2 format through the 2002 season, home-field advantage generally alternated between leagues each year. Prior to the 1994 strike, the National League champion received home-field advantage in even-numbered years and the American League champion in odd-numbered years; these were reversed for 1995–2002 (because 1994 would have been the NL's turn to have home-field, but the World Series was canceled by the aforementioned strike). This changed in 2003.\nThe 2002 All-Star Game ended in a tie, much to the displeasure of both fans and sportswriters, who complained about a lack of intensity and competitiveness on the part of the players. This hit especially close to home for Commissioner Bud Selig, as the game had been played in his home city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In response, to make the game's outcome more meaningful, in 2003, MLB began assigning home-field advantage in the World Series to the winner of that year's All-Star Game, which is typically held in mid-July.\nFollowing the acceptance of a new collective bargaining agreement after the 2016 season (which went into effect in 2017) home-field advantage in the World Series is no longer tied to the outcome of the All-Star Game, but instead is granted to the team with the better regular-season record. One exception was 2020, when all World Series games were played at a neutral site. The home-field advantage in the World Series (i.e., the home team for games 1, 2, 6, and 7) was granted to the pennant winner with the higher seed in its league, not necessarily the team with the better regular season record. If both pennant winners had the same seed, their regular season records decided the result.\nLeague Championship Series.\nUntil 1998, the LCS alternated home-field advantage with a 2–3 format in the best-of-5 era (1969–1984) and a 2–3–2 format when it went to best-of-7 (1985–present). Since 1998, the team with the better record has had home field advantage, but a wild card team never secures the extra home game, regardless of regular-season records, unless both teams in the League Championship Series are wild cards (starting in 2022).\nDivision Series.\nUntil 1997, the Division Series rotated in which one of the three division-winning teams did not have home-field advantage, with the wild card team never having it. From 1998 to 2021, the two division winners with the best records in each league had home-field while the worst-ranked division winner and wild-card team (the winner of the Wild Card Game) did not. Since 2022, the two division winners with the best records in each league have had home-field advantage over the two wild card series winners. The Division Series used a 2–3 format until 1998 and now uses a 2–2–1 format. This is seen as a fairer distribution of home-field advantage because previously under the 2–3 format, the team hosting the first two games had absolutely no chance of winning the series at home. With the current 2–2–1 format, however, \"both\" teams have the home-field advantage in a sense. While one team gets to host three games (including the critical first and last game), the other team does get two chances out of three (games 3 and 4) of winning the series on its home field.\nWith the adoption of the expanded playoff format in 2012, the five-game Division Series began with two home games for the lower seeds, followed by up to three home games for the higher seeds. This one-year change eliminated a travel day prior to a decisive Game 5 of a Division Series and was necessary because the 2012 regular-season schedule was announced before the agreement on the new postseason was reached. Since 2013, the Division Series restored the 2–2–1 format.\nWild Card Round.\nBefore 2012, the Wild Card team played the team with the best record that was not from their division. With the addition of a second Wild Card team, the Wild Card Game, a one-game playoff between the 4/5 seeds, was created. In this round, the 4th-seed (1st Wild Card) hosts the 5th-seed (2nd Wild Card), with the winner advancing to the next round of the playoffs to take on the best division winner in their respective league (regardless whether or not the teams are in the same division). This has caused some controversy in that some people want a three-game series to determine a winner instead of an elimination game to make the playoffs more fair. The 2020 implementation of the Wild Card Series had all three games hosted at the higher seed, to reduce travel, and to reward regular season performance. The 2020 format was used again starting in 2022, but with the top two division winners receiving a bye to the Division Series, and the remaining four teams playing in this round. In this case, the third seed (lowest-seeded division winner) hosts the sixth seed (third Wild Card team), and the fourth seed (top Wild Card team) hosts the fifth seed (second Wild Card team).\nPostseason bonuses.\nThere are three factors that determine the actual amount of bonus money paid to any individual player: (1) the size of the bonus pool; (2) their team's success in the season/post-season; and (3) the share of the pool assigned to the individual player.\nBonus pool size.\nThere is a separate pool for each series – the Wild Card games, the Division Series, the League Championship Series, and the World Series. The players' bonus pool is funded with 60% of the gate receipts for each of the Wild Card games, the first three games of each Division Series, the first four games of each LCS and the first four games of the World Series; limiting the funding for the pool to these games, the minimum number in each series, removes incentive to extend the series for merely fiscal sake. The value of the gate is determined by the size of the venues, the amount of high-priced premium seating in the venues, the number of games played in the series and whether the games sell out. Ticket prices for each series are set by MLB, not the home teams, so they are relatively uniform across baseball.\nAwarding of bonus money.\nSince 2022, the World Series winner gets 36%, the World Series runner-up, 24%, two League Championship Series losers, 12% each, the four Division Series losers, 3.25% each, and the four Wild Card playoff losers 0.75% each. In 2020, the eight Wild Card Series losers got 0.375% each.\nThe division of the team's share of the pool is voted upon by the players who have been on the team during the entire regular season, in a meeting chaired by their union representative. This meeting follows the trade deadline on July 31. Players who have been with the team for the full season automatically receive a full share. At the meeting, the full-season players vote on whether anyone else—including players who have not been with the team for the full season, coaches, and trainers—is to be granted a full share, less than a full share, a cash award, or no share. After the World Series, the pool of money is split according to the shares determined in the vote. There is no limit to the number of shares that may be granted, but a greater number of shares dilutes the value of each share, and consequently the amount each player is awarded.\nAs an example, playoff-pool full-share holders for the St. Louis Cardinals received each when the team won the World Series in 2006."

The game was played on January 22, 1967, in a heavy rainstorm at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California, before a sparse crowd of 15,062. This was the second-lowest attendance in the history of the Pro Bowl, next to the inaugural game in January 1939, also in Los Angeles.\nThe head coaches were Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys for the East and George Allen of the Los Angeles Rams for the West. The game was played a week after the first Super Bowl, on the same field.\nFor the second year in a row, the East dominated the West on the strength of turnovers, and won 20–10. They recovered two fumbles and intercepted four passes.\nThe game proved that the NFL had a successor to the great Jim Brown, the Hall of Fame fullback who retired prior to training camp, with the presence of the Chicago Bears' Gale Sayers, concluding his second NFL season. Sayers rushed for 110 yards on eleven carries and was named back of the game while veteran defensive tackle Floyd Peters of the Philadelphia Eagles was selected as lineman of the game.\nEach team consisted of 34 players; the winners received $1,500 each and the losers $900."

        "text": "The 1966 Pro Bowl was the National Football League's sixteenth annual all-star game which featured the outstanding performers from the season. The game was played on January 16, 1966, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California, with an attendance of 60,124. The West was favored by a touchdown, but the East won in a rout, 36–7.\nThe Western Conference stars were led by Vince Lombardi, head coach of the league champion Green Bay Packers. The coach of the Eastern Conference, Blanton Collier of the Cleveland Browns, used the domination of the West that year as a rallying cry for the Eastern team as they prepared to take the field.\nDuring the 1965 season, the Western Conference had dominated the Eastern Conference — Western teams were 13–1 in regular season inter-conference games and had won the league championship two weeks earlier, the third-place Playoff Bowl, and the previous two editions in this series. The domination extended to the college ranks as well, with the West team winning the Rose Bowl and the East–West Shrine Game (college all-star game).\nAt the same time, Lombardi felt his West squad was at an unfair disadvantage in the game due to a denial by the league of a last minute appeal to use his own team's quarterback, Bart Starr, in the game. Starr had previously been scratched due to injury, but had recovered sufficiently to play. In his place, San Francisco 49ers quarterback John Brodie threw a record six interceptions, offset with one touchdown pass late in the game to Tommy McDonald of the Los Angeles Rams to avoid a shutout.\nLinebacker Dale Meinert of the St. Louis Cardinals was named the \"lineman of the game\" while the Cleveland Browns' fullback Jim Brown was awarded \"back of the game\" honors for the third time in his career. Brown carried 21 times for 65 yards, rushing for three touchdowns in the first half. One story line entering the game never materialized, the anticipated showdown between Brown and halfback Gale Sayers of the Chicago Bears, the season's consensus Rookie of the Year; Lombardi surprisingly called only a single play for Sayers, a handoff which gained fifteen yards.\nThis was Brown's final NFL game; he left at the top of his game (league MVP for third time in nine seasons) to pursue an acting career in Hollywood. A month shy of thirty years old, he had a year remaining (1966) on a three-year contract, estimated at $60,000 per year ($ in ), and officially announced his retirement six months later in July from England, on the set of the 1967 film \"The Dirty Dozen.\""

The coaches for the game were Don Shula of Baltimore Colts for the West and Blanton Collier of Cleveland Browns for the East. The West team won by a final score was 34–14.\nThe West dominated the East, 411 to 187 in total yards. West quarterback Fran Tarkenton of the Minnesota Vikings was named \"Back of the Game\" after he completed 8 of 13 passes for 172 yards. At one point during the game, the West backfield was all-Vikings: Tarkenton (No. 10), Tommy Mason (No. 20), and Bill Brown (No. 30).\n\"Lineman of the Game\" honors went to the West’s Terry Barr of the Detroit Lions; Barr had 106 yards receiving on three receptions.\nFrank Ryan, the quarterback of the Cleveland Browns' who had defeated the Baltimore Colts in the 1964 NFL Championship Game, was knocked out of the Pro Bowl when he was sacked in the third quarter by a group of defenders including the Colts' Gino Marchetti. Some thought that Marchetti, who was playing in his tenth Pro Bowl, was trying to teach Ryan a lesson for considering running up the score against the Colts in the championship game. Marchetti denied this, and he and Ryan remained on good terms.\nThis was also the final Pro Bowl game to be televised by NBC before the AFL-NFL merger in 1970."

        "title": "2009 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team",
        "text": "The 2009 Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team represented the University of Arkansas in baseball at the Division I level in the NCAA for the 2009 season. Dave van Horn, a former Razorback player, is the coach in his fifth year. The team clinched a berth in the 2009 College World Series with a defeat of the Florida State Seminoles on June 6. The Razorbacks' run in Omaha ended on June 19 when they were defeated by the LSU Tigers, finishing tied for third nationally with the Arizona State Sun Devils.\nPre-Season.\nAfter a 34–24 record in 2008, Arkansas looked forward to 2009. On October 20, the White team defeated the Red team in the Hogs final fall practice. Despite being picked to finish fourth in the SEC West, the Hogs pulled a #22 ranking from Baseball America. This was the first time Arkansas had ever been ranked in a pre-season poll since 2007, when the team was ranked No. 7 in the nation. The Razorbacks 2009 schedule was ranked #1 hardest in the SEC by SEC baseball.com. Outfielder Chase Leavitt was named a Preseason All-SEC player by Rivals.com. The Razorbacks' recruiting class was ranked 4th best by Collegiate Baseball and 8th best by Baseball America.\nCoaches.\n\"Source: Baseball - 2009 Coaches\"\nTodd Butler was named coach most ready for a head coaching job by SEC coaches when polled by College Baseball Insider.\nSchedule.\nFebruary.\nWashington State.\nThe Razorbacks began the season with three games against Washington State. The schedule was changed to a doubleheader on February 20 due to cold weather. Ben Tschepikow, a senior infielder, hit a 2-run home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The second game was ended Andrew Darr's walk-off home run. The next game took place on February 22, and Darr was again the hero, this time in the form of a squeeze. Arkansas was ranked 22nd in most polls for the series.\nKansas.\nKansas came to Fayetteville for a two-game series with the Diamond Hogs from February 24–27. After dropping the opener pitched by Brett Eibner, the Hogs won the next contest on a Jacob House walk-off home run. House, an occasional starter at first base, entered the game as a pinch hitter in the eighth and delivered a liner that got past the Jayhawk first baseman. The Sophomore delivered again, a walk-off home run in the 10th inning which gave the Razorbacks the win.\nWestern Illinois.\nThe Razorbacks began a three-game series against the Leathernecks of Western Illinois University, a game that was won on a Brett Eibner triple in the tenth inning. Stephen Richards, a junior pitcher, earned his second consecutive win in the game. The remaining two games were cancelled due to a snowstorm.\nMarch.\nValparaiso.\nRedshirt freshman Drew Smyly quieted the Crusader's bats, while Bo Bigham ignited the Razorback sticks, ending in a 7–3 Hog win on March 3. The two teams met in Baum Stadium met again on March 4, with Andy Wilkins swatting his fourth home run of the year. Valpo began to claw back into the game late, but Stephen Richards pitched a scoreless ninth, giving the Hogs a 9–6 win. Arkansas was ranked #21 in most polls throughout the series with Valpo.\nCalifornia.\nThe Razorbacks met their second Pac-10 team, the California Golden Bears, in Baum Stadium. Game 1 was packed with excitement, including a tying home run by Ben Tschepikow in the bottom of the ninth with two outs, and a game winning squeeze by Collin Kuhn. Game two was marred by Razorback errors, giving the 12–6 decision to Cal despite Chase Leavitt going 3 for 3 with two walks. Drew Smyly delivered a strong outing against the Bears in game three, with Leavitt producing a four hit game. Eibner and Darr hit home runs and Zack Cox hit a triple, giving the Hogs the game and series.\nArkansas broke their previous attendance record for a non-conference series with the three game set against Cal, when a total of 21,429 fans attended the three game series.\nCentenary.\nArkansas hit the road for the first time in 2009 for a midweek series with Centenary College of Louisiana. The Hogs had won 25 straight games against the Gentlemen before a 5–1 defeat in 2008. Game 1 ended in an 8–3 Razorback defeat, and the second game was rained out.\n#17 Florida.\nThe Gators came to Fayetteville for a three-game SEC series. This was the conference opener for both squads. The first game was a decisive Razorbacks victory, with Dallas Keuchel earning the 11–4 win. On the following day, Arkansas defeated the Gators 8–4 thanks to a six run second inning. The Sunday game was tied 2–2 until the eighth inning, when Brian McKinney cut and missed on a 3–2 pitch that went into the dirt. The runner advanced to first, when he unintentionally kicked the ball out of UF catcher Buddy Munroe's range. This allowed Ben Tschepikow to score from third base giving the Hogs the lead. Munroe argued that the kick was intentional, a case also argued by Florida coach Kevin O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan was ejected and the Razorbacks tacked on an extra run, giving the Hogs a 4–2 win, 3–0 SEC record, and sweep of Florida.\nNebraska.\nThe Razorbacks were 7–7 against Nebraska entering the two-game series. In the first game, the Hogs wore green hats for Saint Patrick's Day, and seven different Razorbacks got a hit on the way to a 7–3 Arkansas victory. The second game was led 4–1 by Arkansas until a six-run ninth inning. Andy Wilkins hit two home runs in the contest.\nAuburn.\nArkansas entered Plainsman Park on March 20 for a three-game series with Auburn. The first game was a 3–2 Arkansas victory decided by a Ryan Cisterna ninth-inning home run. The next day, Chase Leavitt, Scott Lyons, Jacob House and Collin Kuhn each had two hits in a 10–6 defeat of the Tigers, giving Arkansas a 5–0 start in the SEC for the first time in Razorbacks history. The third game was decided by a four-run first inning, with Ben Tschepikow collecting four hits in the game.\nMissouri State.\nThe Missouri State Bears came to Fayetteville for a single game, a 10–0 Razorbacks win. The Hogs recorded 18 strikeouts, a school record, with Brett Eibner striking out seven.\nMississippi State.\nMississippi State traveled to Arkansas to meet the Razorbacks, who were 3–0 in SEC play. The first game was suspended by rain, but ended a 20–9 Razorbacks win. Dallas Keuchel's outing was ended prematurely when rain poured, suspending the game in the fifth inning. After game 1 was completed, the two teams decided to play a doubleheader of seven innings games on Sunday. T. J. Forrest started the afternoon on the mound for the Razorbacks, winning a 5–1 decision. The second game of the day was dropped to the Bulldogs, 12-4. MSU leadoff man Grant Hogue went 4 for 4, scoring 4 runs.\nMissouri State.\nThe Bears entered the contest winning nine of ten, but again met Brett Eibner, whose two solo home runs thrust the Hogs to a 2–0 victory. The win pushed the Razorbacks' March record to 15-4.\nApril.\n#23 South Carolina.\nDallas Keuchel earned the win as Zack Cox hit a three-run home run to give the Razorbacks the first game of a three-game series, played in brand-new Carolina Stadium. The Gamecocks returned the following day and issued the Hogs a 9–1 thumping, with Scott Lyons driving in the only Razorbacks run. Arkansas would pull out the rubber game, however, a 7–4 victory for Mike Bolsinger.\n#1 Arizona State.\nThe #1 Arizona State Sun Devils came to Fayetteville for the back end of a two-year home-and-home midweek series, with Arkansas also ranked #1 entering the game. The Hogs dropped both games to ASU in 2008, but returned the favor in 2009. Game 1 marked the first #1 vs #1 matchup in Baum Stadium, and Game 2 set the then-Baum record for highest attendance, with 11,434 patrons witnessing the Hogs 8–7 victory.\nThe first game featured a five-run Razorback seventh inning, sparked by a leadoff walk to Chase Leavitt followed by Tom Hauskey, Ben Tschepikow, Andrew Darr, and Scott Lyons all recording hits in the inning. Stephen Richards recorded his fifth save as the game ended a 7–3 Razorbacks win. Arkansas then defeated ASU a second time on April 8, an 8–7 win. The game was decided by Tim Carver single in the fifth inning, completing the transformation from a 6–1 deficit in the third inning.\nVanderbilt.\nArkansas and Vanderbilt met in Baum Stadium for a three-game SEC series. The Razorbacks, fresh off two victories over number 1 Arizona State, dropped both games, with the third being cancelled due to rain. In the two games, Arkansas committed eight errors and gave up a nine-run inning. The offense was also inept, being shut out in game 1 and no-hit through the fifth inning in game 2. Mike Minor of Vanderbilt struck out eleven Razorback batters, only to be one-upped by Caleb Cotham's striking out twelve the following day. The two losses marked the first time Arkansas dropped consecutive games in 2009 as well as the first lost series for the Hogs. The two wins gave Vanderbilt their first series win in Baum Stadium.\nLouisiana-Monroe.\nThe Hogs and Warhawks met for a midweek series on April 14 and 15. The series was split, with the Warhaks taking the first game 3-2. West Covina, California native Scott Lyons won game two in the tenth inning for the Razorbacks, launching a walk-off home run into the Hogs' bullpen.\n#1 Georgia.\nArkansas dropped to #5 after dropping three of four games, and traveled to Athens to play the new #1. Dallas Keuchel threw a strong seven innings, but the Hogs lost 3–4 in game 1. The second game would also be dropped 3-4, this time on a Matt Cerione single in the ninth inning. Razorback sophomore Brett Eibner tossed a gem in game three, preventing the sweep. The Woodlands, Texas, native Eibner threw a complete game one-hit shutout, striking out twelve Bulldogs. The feat garnered Eibner SEC and National Player of the Week honors.\nOral Roberts.\nThe Oral Roberts Golden Eagles hosted the Hogs for one game at J. L. Johnson Stadium in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Hogs prevailed from a 9–6 contest with Zack Cox collecting four hits. The Razorbacks met Oral Roberts again, this time in Baum Stadium, on May 12.\nTennessee.\nArkansas and Tennessee met for an SEC series in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Razorbacks took game 1, 9-3, behind a strong outing by Dallas Keuchel and Jacob House's 4 RBI. The subsequent game was lost on a failed pickoff attempt by Razorback Stephen Richards, who leads the team in saves. The Plano, Texas, native made an errant throw attempting to pickoff Volunteer P.J. Polk, who was on first base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. The Hogs would take the game three slugfest, 15-8, behind Scott Lyons' two home runs.\n#9 Oklahoma.\nArkansas met the #9 Oklahoma Sooners once in Baum Stadium. Brett Eibner took over the game, hitting a tying two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth (his second long ball of the day) and drawing a walk-off walk in the tenth. With the bases loaded and two outs, Eibner was down 0-2 and fouled off six pitches during the twelve-pitch at bat before drawing ball four.\nMay.\n#4 L. S. U..\nThe LSU Fighting Tigers held a one-game lead over the Razorbacks entering this series, which is a heated rivalry. A rain delay caused Game 1 and Game 2 to become a doubleheader on May 2. Dallas Keuchel was outstanding on the mound in game 1, throwing 8.1 innings, allowing only four runs. The Razorbacks scored four runs in the fourth inning, but the fans held their breath when catcher Ryan Cisterna was hit in the face by an Anthony Raunado fastball. Raunado would hit Eibner later, causing umpires to issue warnings, and an LSU relief pitcher would also hit Zack Cox in the contest. Game 2 would have another outstanding pitching performance, this time by LSU's Louis Coleman. He delivered a two-hit shutout, splitting the series' first two games. The Sunday contest ended when a Razorback's rally fell one run short, 4-3.\n#21 Alabama.\nArkansas and Alabama squared off in Tuscaloosa for a critical SEC series. The Hogs would be swept by the Crimson Tide.\nDallas Keuchel turned in a great performance, but had no run support and lost a 2–1 decision. The Hogs lost game two 8-6, with freshman outfielder Collin Kuhn homering twice. Alabama homered four times in game three, taking a 5–6 decision from Brett Eibner.\nArkansas clinched a berth in the 2009 SEC baseball tournament when Auburn defeated Kentucky on May 9.\nOral Roberts.\nArkansas snapped a season-long five game losing skid with a victory over Oral Roberts. The offense continued to struggle, but managed to eke three runs across, the third by Scott Lyons in the bottom of the ninth.\n#9 Ole Miss.\nArkansas committed four errors in the opener with Ole Miss, resulting in a 7–5 loss. The Razorbacks also dropped game two due to a six run seventh inning for the Rebels. The Rebels also won game three on the Razorbacks' senior night. The Razorbacks entered the SEC Tournament as the #7 seed.\nSEC tournament.\nArkansas played the first game of the tournament, an 8–5 defeat of #9 Florida. The Hogs next matched up with the #21 Georgia Bulldogs. The game entered the tenth inning tied 1–1 when a Georgia batter hit a bases loaded liner to Zack Cox. Cox delivered home but catcher Ryan Cisterna could not keep his foot on home plate, allowing Matt Ceronie to score the winning run. Arkansas played Florida again in an elimination game on May 22. Arkansas again defeated the Gators, the fifth time this season. The win marked the first time Arkansas beat the same SEC opponent five times in one year since joining the league. Zack Cox hit a home run that crushed the scoreboard, described by announcers as the \"longest home run they had seen in Hoover\". Vanderbilt would crush the Razorbacks in the semifinal game, 11-1. The game was ended prematurely due to the mercy rule, ending the Razorbacks run in the SEC Tournament.\nNCAA tournament: Norman Regional.\nArkansas received an invitation to play in the Norman regional as a #2 seed. The games are hosted by the Oklahoma Sooners, with L. Dale Mitchell Baseball Park hosting all games played in the regional among #21 Arkansas, #9 Oklahoma, #23 Washington State, and Wichita State. Arkansas defeated Washington State on May 29 by the score of 10-3. The Hogs took advantage of a great catch by Jarrod McKinney and a nine run eight inning to beat the Cougars for the fourth time this year.\nArkansas would play #9 Oklahoma next due to the Sooner's win over Wichita State. The game would be a 17–6 Arkansas victory, with Scott Lyons, James McCann, Ben Tschepikow, and Andy Wilkins all collecting at least three hits. The team collected 20 hits in the contest, a season high.\nThe Razorbacks played Oklahoma again on May 31, an elimination game for the Sooners. Razorbacks freshman pitcher Drew Smyly threw fell two outs short of a no-hitter, with the offense scoring eleven runs. Andy Wilkins (a Broken Arrow, Oklahoma native) went 5–5 at the plate with two doubles, two home runs, four runs scored and five RBI.\nThe win pushed Arkansas into its third super regional, played at Dick Howser Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida, against the Florida State Seminoles. Oklahoma was the #7 national seed.\nNCAA tournament: Tallahassee Super Regional.\nArkansas and Florida State met previously in the 2004 Fayetteville Super Regional, with the Hogs emerging victorious.\nArkansas took Game 1 from the Seminoles thanks to a three-run seventh and two-run eighth inning. The game took over nine hours real-time to complete due to multiple rain delays. Arkansas center fielder Brett Eibner was featured on SportsCenter's Top 10 plays for a catch he made in the third inning.\nArkansas entered Game 2 with Brett Eibner on the mound and Florida State one loss away from elimination. Second baseman Bo Bigham gave the Hogs a 6–5 lead in the seventh inning of Game 2, but senior platoon outfielder Andrew Darr gave the Hogs the biggest hit of the game in the bottom of the ninth when he hit a two-run double off the wall. The two runs batted in gave the Hogs a 9–8 lead they would not relinquish, giving the Razorbacks their first College World Series appearance since 2004.\nCollege World Series.\nArkansas became the first team to punch its ticket to Omaha. The Razorbacks played the Cal State Fullerton Titans, winners of the Fullerton Super Regional first. LSU beat Arkansas on June 15 after defeating Virginia. Arkansas next played the Cavaliers in a College World Series classic, a twelve-inning affair that resulted in Virginia's elimination.\nGame 1: Cal State Fullerton.\nThe Razorbacks had met the Titans three times previous to this, twice in the 1979 College World Series. The Razorbacks dropped all three contests.\nArkansas began the scoring on a Zack Cox single, scoring Chase Leavitt and Ben Tschepikow. Cox would hit a two-run home run in the subsequent inning, making it a 4–0 Arkansas advantage. Fullerton would respond with two runs, but a spectacular play by Bo Bigham would be the highlight of the inning. Scott Lyons hit a two-run single in the fifth inning to make it a 6–2 Hog lead, followed by a three-run home run by Andy Wilkins. The final would be a 10–6 Razorbacks win, with Dallas Keuchel earning the win by pitching six innings and Mike Bolsinger earning the three-inning save.\nGame 6: L. S. U..\nArkansas and LSU had met previously this season, with the Bayou Bengals taking two of three games.\nThe Razorbacks bats could not touch Louis Coleman, but LSU got to Hog starter Brett Eibner. Mikie Mahtook gave the Tigers a 3–0 lead in the first with a home run to left field, followed by an Andy Wilkins sacrifice fly. Ryan Schimpf doubled to score DJ LeMahieu in the fourth, giving the Tigers a 4–1 lead. A five-run sixth inning gave LSU the final margin of 9-1.\nGame 9: Virginia.\nArkansas and Virginia played on June 17 in an elimination game. The Cavaliers took a two-run lead in the fifth inning off Razorbacks pitcher Drew Smyly. Arkansas was down to their final strike in the top of the ninth inning when Brett Eibner homered to tie the game at three. The game would remain scoreless until the twelfth inning, when Andrew Darr doubled to score Jarrod McKinney. Dallas Keuchel, the Game 1 starter, would close out the game from the tenth inning to keep the Hogs' hopes alive.\nGame 11: L. S. U..\nArkansas used eight pitchers, including closer Stephen Richards starting the game in an effort to keep their Omaha hopes alive. LSU jumped out to a 1–0 lead in the top of the first inning when Micah Gibbs scored Blake Dean. The Tigers would push the advantage to 4–0 in the third inning, which included an error and a wild pitch by the Razorbacks. LSU hit solo home runs in the fifth and sixth innings, making the score 6-0. The seventh inning would produce five LSU runs, with the Hogs using four pitchers to record three outs. Arkansas center fielder Brett Eibner hit a two-run home run, scoring Jacob House to make the score 11-2, but the Tigers would get those two runs back in the bottom of the seventh. Chase Leavitt hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth, scoring Thomas Hauskey and Andrew Darr, but the game ended a 15–4 final. Arkansas was eliminated from the College World Series tied for third place with the Arizona State Sun Devils."

Captained by Charles Lewis, Norton entered a team containing ten new caps, after the Welsh team were humiliated in their inaugural game against England. Wales won the game making it the very first international victory for the team. Norton was reselected for the next five matches, completing the entirety of the 1883 and 1884 Home Nations Championships. Wales lost both games of the 1883 Championship, and the opening two games of the 1884 tournament, but were successful for the final game of the series against Ireland. The 1884 Irish game saw the Ireland team arrive two players short and were forced to borrow two Welsh players to complete their team.

        "text": "Nathaniel Robinson (born January 18, 1985) is a former American football defensive tackle. He was signed by the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Once a heralded high school athlete, Robinson was an underachiever during his college football career at Rutgers and Akron.\nHigh school career.\nA native of Irvington, New Jersey, Robinson attended Irvington High School, a school that struggled with gang-related violence. As a junior in 2001, he recorded 82 tackles, including 17 tackles for loss, as well as 14 quarterback sacks, nine pass deflections and six caused fumbles. He missed most of his senior season due to a knee injury, but was still rated one of the best defensive lineman in the nation. In fact, \"Rivals.com\" gave Robinson their only five-star rating among defensive tackles, and ranked him No. 1 in a class that also included Sedrick Ellis, Marcus Thomas, and Fili Moala.\nAfter official visits to Rutgers, Syracuse, and Miami (FL), Robinson committed to the Hurricanes, together with the only other five-star recruit from New Jersey, Greg Olsen of Wayne Hills. Unlike Olsen, however, Robinson was unable to meet the school's academic qualification standards. Although Robinson's SAT score of 800 met the NCAA minimum for high school students with a 3.0 grade point average, it was 20 points shy of Miami's institutional standard. With the perspective of being declared ineligible, Robinson decided to not enroll at Miami, and instead went to Rutgers. He was the only four- or five-star recruit in Rutgers' class.\nCollege career.\nThe injury from his high school senior year also caused Robinson to miss the first half of his true freshman year at Rutgers. He only saw action in the final six games of the season, and recorded a total of three tackles and a single quarterback sack—coincidentally against the Miami Hurricanes. In his sophomore year, Robinson played in eight of 11 games, including the final six contests, finishing the season with 15 tackles, including five solo stops. In April 2005, he was dismissed for violation of team policy, and eventually transferred to Akron.\nAfter sitting out the 2005 season while fulfilling NCAA transfer requirements, Robinson played 11 of 12 games for the Akron Zips in 2006. He had 23 tackles, including six for losses with a sack. In his senior year, he was moved in and out of the lineup, registering 26 tackles, including five for a loss, for the season.\nProfessional career.\n2008 NFL Draft.\nAfter a disappointing college career, Robinson was projected to go undrafted in the 2008 NFL Draft. After doing so, he was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Giants.\nNew York Sentinels.\nRobinson was signed by the New York Sentinels of the United Football League on September 9, 2009. He was released before the season began.\nToronto Argonauts.\nOn April 4, 2011, Robinson signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. He was released by the Argonauts on June 15, 2011.\nPersonal.\nOn December 26, 2013, Robinson was arrested on gun and drug charges in Newark, New Jersey."

        "text": "The Florida Gators women's tennis team represents the University of Florida in the sport of tennis. The Gators compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They play their home matches in Linder Stadium on the university's Gainesville, Florida, campus, and are currently led by head coach Roland Thornqvist. In the thirty-nine-year history of the Gators women's tennis program, the team has won twenty-five SEC championships and seven NCAA national tournament championships.\nHistory.\nThe origins of the Florida Gators women's tennis team date to 1960, when Florida undergraduate Alice Tym organized and led a successful intercollegiate women's tennis club team. As Title IX expanded opportunities for women in college sports, the University of Florida sponsored its first intercollegiate varsity women's tennis team in 1972–1973. In the early years of the program, the Lady Gators were a perennial top-ten team in the national championship tournaments sponsored by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), including a second-place finish in the 1980 AIAW tournament.\nSince the NCAA began sponsoring national championships in women's sports in 1981–1982, the Lady Gators have won five NCAA team championships, four NCAA singles championships, and four NCAA doubles championships. In addition to their five NCAA team championships, the Lady Gators have also finished second in the NCAA national championships tournament seven times, including 1988, 1990, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2010. As a team, the Gators have failed to qualify for the AIAW and NCAA national championship tournaments only three times (1973, 1986 and 2009).\nThe Gators have also dominated the Southeastern Conference, winning twenty-five conference championships and seventeen SEC tournament titles since the SEC sanctioned women's tennis as a conference sport in 1980. In addition to the NCAA titles the Florida Gators have also won seven ITA National Championships (1988,1991,1992,1996,1997,1999 and 2017). &lt;https://floridagators.com/news/2017/2/13/womens-tennis-gators-win-ita-national-indoor-championship.aspx&gt; \nBrandi era: 1985–2001.\nLed by their fourth-year coach, Andy Brandi, the Florida Gators women's tennis team made its first appearance in the NCAA championship tournament finals in Los Angeles, California in 1988. The Lady Gators entered the tournament the top-seeded team, but were decisively upset by the Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team, five matches to two, in the final of the team championship. The Gators' No. 1 singles player, Shaun Stafford, was upset in the team championships, but recovered to win the individual NCAA singles championship by defeating her teammate Halle Cioffi in the championship final.\nThe Lady Gators hosted the NCAA national championship tournament on their home courts at Linder Stadium in Gainesville for the first time in 1990. Led by their top singles players, freshman Andrea Farley and junior Nicole Arendt, the second-seeded Gators battled to the championship finals before falling to the top-seeded Stanford Cardinal women, five matches to one.\nThe Gators won their first NCAA national team championship in Palo Alto, California, in 1992. Led by star freshman Lisa Raymond, the Gators beat the Texas Longhorns women's tennis team five matches to three. Raymond also won the individual 1992 NCAA championship in singles.\nIn 1995, for the fourth time in eight seasons, the Lady Gators reached the championship finals of the NCAA tournament, held in Malibu, California. After blazing through the first three rounds of the tournament without losing a single match, the Texas Longhorns edged the Gators in the finals, five matches to four, in one of the most evenly matched championship finals ever held.\nIn 1996, Brandi's top-ranked and undefeated Gators earned their second NCAA team championship in Tallahassee, Florida. Lady Gators Jill Craybas, Dawn Buth, Lisa Pugliese and Stephanie Nickitas won their singles matches, and Craybas and Lori Ann Freedman won the doubles match, as the team decisively defeated the Stanford Cardinal women five matches to two. The Lady Gators' previous record against the Cardinal in NCAA tournament play was 0–3. Craybas also claimed the individual 1996 NCAA singles championship, and Buth and Nickitas won the 1996 NCAA doubles title—only the second time in NCAA history that a women's team won the national team, singles and doubles titles in the same season. The Gators finished the season 31–0 in team matches, and defeated twenty college teams ranked among the top twenty-five in the country.\nThe top-seeded Gators reached the championship finals of the NCAA tournament for the third straight year in 1997, before falling to the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to one, in Palo Alto.\nBrandi's undefeated Lady Gators claimed their third NCAA team championship in 1998 by crushing the Duke Blue Devils women's tennis team, five matches to one, in South Bend, Indiana. Led by seniors Bonnie Bleecker and Stephanie Nickitas, the second-seeded Gators won the doubles match and four of the five singles matches in the tournament final.\nAt the 1999 NCAA tournament held in Gaiensville, the top-seeded Gators women's tennis team returned to the championship finals for the fifth consecutive season, but lost to its national rival, the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to two, for the fourth time since 1988.\nDuring Brandi's seventeen-year tenure, three individual Gators won four NCAA singles championships: Shaun Stafford in 1988; Lisa Raymond in 1992 and 1993; and Jill Craybas in 1996. In NCAA doubles championship play, three Gators doubles teams have won four NCAA doubles championships: Jillian Alexander and Nicole Arendt in 1991; Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas in 1996 and 1997; and Whitney Laiho and Jessica Lehnhoff in 2001.\nThornqvist era: 2002 to present.\nIn his first season the Lady Gators' new head coach, Roland Thornqvist returned the Gators to the finals of the 2002 NCAA championship tournament in Palo Alto, California. The top-seeded Gators faced the Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team for the second consecutive year in the NCAA tournament, and suffered the same fate: a 4–1 loss to the Cardinal.\nThe Gators won their fourth NCAA team championship in 2003, and their first under new head coach Roland Thornqvist, by defeating the top-ranked and defending NCAA champion Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team four matches to three in Gainesville. Gators Jennifer Magley and Zerene Reyes won the doubles match, with Julia Scaringe, Julie Rotondi and Alexis Gordon winning singles matches to clinch the 2003 team title. The Cardinal women had previously beaten the Gators to win the NCAA team championships in the two preceding seasons.\nAfter failing to qualify for the NCAA tournament in 2009, and after a six-season absence from the NCAA tournament finals, the Gators returned to the championship match in Athens, Georgia 2010, once again facing their old nemesis, the Stanford Cardinal women. In a closely contested championship final, the Cardinal edged the Lady Gators, four matches to three. It was the Gators' seventh second-place performance in the NCAA championships (six of those championship losses at the hands of Stanford).\nThornqvist's Lady Gators claimed the program's fifth NCAA team championship in 2011 by defeating the No. 1 ranked Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team on Stanford's home courts in Palo Alto. Led by sophomore Lauren Embree in a dramatic come-from-behind third-set victory, the Gators defeated the Cardinal four matches to three, by taking the doubles match and singles matches by freshmen Alex Cercone and Olivia Janowicz. It was the third time the Gators defeated Stanford in the NCAA championship finals.\nYear-by-year results.\nThrough the conclusion of the 2010–2011 season, the Lady Gators have compiled an overall win–loss record in dual matches of 875–128 (.872).\nAll-Americans.\nFifty-eight members of the Florida Gators women's tennis team have earned 140 All-American honors."

        "title": "List of Super Bowl lead-out programs",
        "text": "The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL), and is typically the highest-rated single television broadcast in the United States of any given year. As such, the television network that broadcasts the game will typically use it as a tent-pole for another program—airing following the conclusion of the game telecast—to take advantage of and retain the expanded audience.\nThe lead-out program is typically a highly anticipated special episode or a season premiere of an existing primetime program (such as a flagship drama, sitcom, or reality series), or in some cases, the premiere of a new series.\nOverview.\nThe Super Bowl provides an extremely strong lead-in to the programming on the channel following the game, the effects of which can last for several hours. For instance, in discussing the ratings of a local TV station, Buffalo, New York television critic Alan Pergament noted on the coattails from Super Bowl XLVII, which aired on CBS: \"A paid program that ran on Channel 4 at 2:30 in the morning had a 1.3 rating. That's higher than some CW prime time shows get on WNLO-TV, Channel 4's sister station.\"\nThe Super Bowl lead-out is typically aired across most U.S. markets simultaneously, and is usually one hour in length, although before the game adopted its standard kickoff time of just after 6:00 p.m. ET in the early 1990s, it was not uncommon for longer programs to be broadcast. When the game moved into a later time slot in 1983, the game and its associated post-game programming would be scheduled until 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time / 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time, allowing for only one hour of network programming until the late local news. Outside of the few blowout games through the game's history, these programs never have started anywhere near the mentioned time, due to the extended length of the pre-game, halftime, and post-game festivities. Viewership for ABC's airing of \"Alias\" in 2003 after Super Bowl XXXVII was dampened by an unusually-long 40-minute post-game show (which featured a performance by Bon Jovi prior to the trophy presentation), which pushed the start time past 11:00 p.m. ET. Although a series high, the episode was one of the lowest-rated Super Bowl lead-outs at the time. At Super Bowl LVIII, the series premiere of \"Tracker\" was pushed to 11:14 p.m. ET due to the game's overtime finish (which made it the longest Super Bowl game to-date), but CBS did achieve 18.4 million viewers.\nIt is common for affiliates in the home markets of the competing teams to delay the lead-out show further, until after additional local post-game coverage (though in 2018, despite the Philadelphia Eagles's win, NBC's Philadelphia station WCAU chose to carry post-game coverage to their Cozi TV subchannel while \"This Is Us\" is airing on the main channel as scheduled then moved its postgame coverage back to WCAU at 11 p.m. once NBC’s programming ends, to reduce viewer inconvenience).\nIn 1979, 1999, 2010, and 2017, and largely from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, this slot was used to showcase a new series or movie, such as \"The A-Team\" or \"The Wonder Years\", or broadcast a special episode of an \"up-and-coming\" series. However, many of the series were ultimately unsuccessful, with some being canceled within a matter of weeks. Since then, virtually all of the programs in the post-game timeslot have been special episodes of series that had already aired for at least one season.\nThe most recent Super Bowl lead-out program to have also been a series premiere is \"Tracker\", which followed CBS's broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII in 2024. A previous example, \"Undercover Boss\" (which was launched following Super Bowl XLIV on CBS) attracted the largest peak half-hour viewership of any Super Bowl lead-out program to date, with 75.474 million viewers. Four other series have had their season premieres following the Super Bowl: two editions of \"Survivor\", the and series (which followed Super Bowls XXXV and XXXVIII), which aired on CBS, \"The Voice\", which launched its second season following Super Bowl XLVI on NBC, and \"The Masked Singer\", which launched its third season after Super Bowl LIV on Fox.\nAlthough Fox almost never programs time slots after 10:00 p.m. except on Saturdays (instead encouraging its affiliates to air local news in the slot), Fox has aired lead-out programming after the Super Bowl ever since it began airing the game in 1997, which normally preempts local newscasts. The Fox affiliates in the market of the winning team sometimes air a post-Super Bowl newscast immediately following the game and delay the lead-out program until after the newscast's conclusion; two such examples included New York flagship O&amp;O WNYW (after the New York Giants won Super Bowl XLII) and Boston affiliate WFXT (after the New England Patriots won Super Bowl LI).\nCurrently, a regular-length episode of a drama series will usually air, although in some cases a one-hour episode of a sitcom (normally 30 minutes in length), or two episodes of different sitcoms paired together, may air instead. Quite often the selected series is one of the \"prestige\" shows for the network showing the game that year, or a moderate hit (e.g. \"Friends\" and \"3rd Rock From the Sun\" on NBC,\"The X-Files\" on Fox, \"Criminal Minds\" on CBS, or \"Grey's Anatomy\" on ABC), which the network wants to give a higher profile. \"The Simpsons\" has aired in the slot twice, with both airings being paired with the premieres of animated sitcoms (\"Family Guy\" in 1999, and \"American Dad!\" in 2005). An occasional practice used to maximize the effect of the lead-out is to make the Super Bowl episode a cliffhanger, with a story that concludes later in the week in the program's regularly scheduled timeslot, (\"3rd Rock From the Sun\" in 1998, \"Grey's Anatomy\" in 2006, and \"The Blacklist\" in 2015).\nRarely, and especially before the game moved to a 6:00 p.m. kickoff, the lead-out has been another sporting event, with the most recent case being Super Bowl LVI in 2022—which was followed by coverage of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Previously, the last Super Bowl to have a sporting event as a lead-out was Super Bowl X in 1976—which was followed by final round coverage of the Phoenix Open golf tournament.\nIt has also been rare for a Super Bowl leadout program to be a made-for-TV movie, as was the case of \"Raid on Entebbe\" following Super Bowl XI and \"Brotherhood of the Rose\" following Super Bowl XXIII.\nBecause the Super Bowl is on a Sunday, before the mid-2000s, networks never carried a new episode of their weeknight late night talk shows after the game, lead-out program and local news. However this has changed since then, usually after the late local news, in order to give those programs an additional promotional push to introduce the current generation of hosts (who have been more willing to promote their series on more than a traditional Monday-to-Friday schedule, and have had a wider audience via internet video than their predecessors). This was first done with the live premiere episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" after Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003, followed by \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\" after Super Bowl XLI in 2007. \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" was next to follow in 2012 after Super Bowl XLVI, finishing a week of shows recorded from Indianapolis. Ferguson aired a special episode from New Orleans after Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. In 2015, Jimmy Fallon had another new episode after Super Bowl XLIX from Phoenix, this time as the host of \"The Tonight Show\". In 2016 for Super Bowl 50, CBS aired a special live episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" as its lead-out, rather than a primetime series episode. \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" also aired a special edition after local newscasts. Fallon then hosted another episode after Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis. Colbert followed suit in subsequent years that CBS aired the game. \nThe most common lead-out program is the news magazine \"60 Minutes\", which has aired after four Super Bowls (VI, XIV, XVI, XXVI). \"Lassie\" was the lead-out show three times (I, II, IV) and three series have appeared in the time slot twice—\"The Wonderful World of Disney\" (I, VII).\"The Simpsons\" (XXXIII, XXXIX) and \"Survivor\" (XXXV, XXXVIII)\nList of lead-out programs.\nThe following is a list of shows that have aired after the Super Bowl in the United States:\nLead-outs in Canada.\nThe Canadian broadcast rightsholder to the Super Bowl which airs the game in simulcast with the U.S. broadcaster – CTV since 2008 – airs its own specific lead-out programs for Canadian audiences, as the Canadian network does not necessarily own domestic rights to the program airing as the lead-out of the U.S. broadcaster. For example, after Super Bowl XLV, CTV aired the season finale of its original drama \"Flashpoint\", as \"Glee\" rights were held by Global. Global counter-programmed the game with a theme night it dubbed \"Sue-Per Bowl Sunday\", which featured episodes of the series, and \"Glee\"-themed episodes of \"The Simpsons\" (\"Elementary School Musical\") and \"The Office\" to lead into the new episode \"The Sue Sylvester Shuffle\" after the game. Citytv similarly acquired rights to the Super Bowl LIII lead-out \"The World's Best\". Super Bowls XLVI, LII, and LIV provided exceptions, as CTV is the Canadian rightsholder of \"The Voice\", \"This Is Us\", and \"The Masked Singer\".\nCTV was to air a \"sneak peek\" of the second season of its original sitcom \"Spun Out\" after Super Bowl XLIX, but the premiere was pulled after cast member J. P. Manoux was charged with voyeurism. The season 2 premiere of \"MasterChef Canada\" was pushed ahead to air in its place.\nPrograms marked in bold were aired in simulcast with the U.S. Super Bowl lead-out."

He stayed for two seasons, but was less successful, compiling a 2–18 record.\nIn 2006, Clark became the defensive coordinator for Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. He installed a 3–4 defense, which had previously never been used at Liberty. During that first season, the Liberty Flames ranked 12th nationally in scoring defense, allowing 15.64 points per game, and 36th in total defense, allowing a total of 306.0 yards per game.\nHe returned to Williamsburg in 2012 to serve as the Tribe's defensive backs coach.\nAfter three seasons with the Tribe, Clark was hired by Scott Wachenheim as the defensive coordinator of the Virginia Military Institute. In addition to being a defensive coordinator, Clark will also handle the defensive backs and secondary.\nAfter leading the Keydets' defense for eights seasons, including helping guide VMI to a Southern Conference championship and FCS playoff berth in the spring season of 2021, Clark resigned in February 2022. In March 2022, Clark was hired as the assistant head football coach at Hampden–Sydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia. The move reunited Clark with long-time friend Marty Favret, whom he coached with at Catholic University."

        "title": "Baseball (drinking game)",
        "text": "Baseball is a drinking game in which players shoot a ping-pong ball across a table with the intent of landing the ball in one of several cups of beer on the other end, doing so in a way combining beer pong and flip cup. The game typically consists of two teams of even numbers, one on each side of a table, and four cups set up on each side. The cups are lined up in a straight line representing the bases with the last cup at the edge of the table.\nWhen a ball lands in a cup, the defending team must consume all of the beer inside that cup and all the cups below it, e.g. if the third cup is hit (a triple), the third, second and first cup are consumed. The cups are filled according to their position on the table. The cup closest to the opposing team is 1/4 full, the second cup is 1/2 full, the third cup is 3/4 full and the final cup nearest the edge is full. It is also common to have a glass of water with the purpose of cleaning the ball between throws. After consumption the cup is refilled to the appropriate level and placed back on the table.\nThe game consists of nine innings in which each team gets to \"bat.\" if a ball is thrown and does not hit or land in a cup this is an out. Each team gets three outs per inning. The team with the greatest score after nine innings is considered the winner. Variation: the game can be played using \"little league\" rules in which the game is over after six innings. Variation: if a ball is thrown and hits a cup it may be caught by \"fielders\" prior to touching the table or floor for an out.\nSetup.\nFourteen cups are needed, seven for each team, four representing the bases, then three on each side of the table representing bases for baserunners. The four cups representing the bases are lined up in a straight line with the last cup at the edge of the table. The cups for flip cup are placed near the center of the table so that judging who won the flip cup can be done easily.\nTeams.\nBaseball is usually played with two teams of even numbers, though it can be played by an odd number so long as the relative drinking/playing strengths are even. Each team begins with two captains who pick their team in an alternating fashion. The captain who picks second then chooses whether to be home (shoot second) or away (shoot first.)\nPlaying field.\nThe game is typically played on either a ping pong table or a folding banquet table. In general, this will be a plywood board cut to proper size, sometimes painted with sports, school, or fraternity symbols and given a liquid-proof coating.\nEquipment.\nThe most common cups used are 16-ounce disposable plastic cups with ridge-lines which can be used precisely to measure the amount of beer to be poured into the cup. \n38 mm or 40 mm table tennis (ping pong) balls are typically used for game play.\nAlcohol.\nUsually an inexpensive light beer is used because of the large quantities of beer which may be consumed during the course of several games. You may or may not get belligerently drunk from playing baseball, and it usually devolves into a contact sport by the 7th inning stretch.\nGame play.\nGame play proceeds much like a game of beer pong. The team that is up shoots the ball until they accumulate three outs, via getting 3 strikes (by missing the cups), being caught out (which can occur when a ball bounces off a cup and the opposing team catches it), or being thrown out stealing. At this point the other team begins to shoot. After nine innings the score is calculated and the team with more runs wins.\nAt bat.\nFour cups are arranged so that the farthest cup is touching the far edge of the table. The cups are arranged vertically and touching so that each cup is one cup's diameter closer to the person \"at bat.\" The cups are filled with beer so that the \"single cup\" (being the cup closest to the batter) is filled 1/4 of the way. The \"double cup\" is filled to half. The \"triple cup\" is filled to 3/4, and the \"home run cup\" is filled all the way.\nIf a player lands the ball in a cup the opposing team must consume that cup and all cups below it, e.g. the second cup is hit (a double) so the second and first cup are consumed. The cups are refilled to the appropriate line and placed back in formation.\nEach player gets three attempts (strikes) to get a hit (make the ball in one of those cups). A miss (hitting a cup without an opposing team member catching it) is considered a strike. The opposing team can field the batter out by catching a foul ball (as described above). If the player misses all the cups during any shot in the at bat it is considered an out. \nIf a person shoots out of order just like in baseball if caught the shooter is not out but the person that was skipped is out.\nBase running.\nWhen a player makes a cup they are said to be on base. Three cups must be set up as bases: The \"first base\" cup must be filled 1/2 of the way full; the \"second base\" cup is to be filled 3/4 full; the \"third base\" cup is full. A designated \"catcher\" from the fielding team must also have a cup that is filled to 1/3. A base runner advances to the base corresponding to his at bat. A single puts him on first base, a double onto second base, etc. There are two ways to advance a runner: the runner can advance by the at bat player hitting the ball (which moves him the corresponding number of bases) or by stealing.\nBase stealing.\nThis means they are now playing flip cup against a person from the other team, a catcher. If the person on base wishes to advance (steal) they begin to play single cup flip cup. If the person on base wins they advance, if they lose they are thrown out, and are off the bases and an out is recorded. The person attempting to steal must not try to steal until the opposing team has set and refilled their cups, an attempt to steal before this is done is considered void and must be sent back to the original base. If the catcher lifts up their cup before the base runner lifts up their cup this is a balk and the base runner advances one base. \nDefending.\nIf a player throws a ball that hits a cup and the opposing team catches it, it is an out. Should a player throw an airball (the ball touches no cups), it is considered an out. The person catching must rotate by inning and no one can catch a second time until everyone has caught once. All catches must be made using the players off-hand (the hand that glove would be worn on during a real game of baseball). All catches must be made cleanly without trapping the ball against the body or letting the ball hit the floor. \nMan Lodge Rules.\nAn alternate set of rules (known as \"Man Lodge Rules\") exists to make the game higher scoring, feel more similar to actual baseball, and make home runs more rewarding. In Man Lodge rules the gameplay is similar except:\nHoover Rules.\nAn alternate set of rules (known as \"Hoover Rules\") exists to make the game more challenging for more experienced players. "

Essentially, baseball coaches are analogous to assistant coaches in other sports, as the baseball manager is to the head coach.\nRoles of professional baseball coaches.\nBaseball is unique in that the manager and coaches typically all wear numbered uniforms similar to those of the players, due to the early practice of managers frequently being selected from the player roster. The wearing of uniforms continued even after the practice of playing managers and coaches waned; notable exceptions to this were Baseball Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack, who always wore a black suit during his 50 years at the helm of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Burt Shotton, manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1940s, who wore a Dodger 200 cap and a team jacket over street clothes in the dugout. After the widespread adoption of numbered uniforms in the early 1930s, Joe McCarthy, another Hall of Fame manager, wore a full uniform but no number on his back for the remainder of his career with the New York Yankees, then the Boston Red Sox. All three men retired during or after the season.\nFull-time coaches in professional baseball date to , when John McGraw of the New York Giants engaged Arlie Latham and Wilbert Robinson as coaches. By the 1920s, most major league teams had two full-time coaches stationed in foul territory near first base and third base when their team was batting, although the manager often doubled as third-base coach, and specialists such as pitching coaches were rare. After World War II, most major league teams listed between three and five coaches on their roster, as managers increasingly ran their teams from the dugout full-time, and appointed pitching and bullpen coaches to assist them and the baseline coaches. Batting and bench coaches came into vogue during the 1960s and later. Because of the proliferation of uniformed coaches in the modern game, by the late 2000s Major League Baseball had restricted the number of uniformed staff to six coaches and one manager during the course of a game. Beginning with the 2013 season, clubs have been permitted to employ a seventh uniformed coach, designated the assistant hitting coach, at their own discretion.\nBench coach.\nThe first bench coach in baseball was George Huff, who took that helm for the Illinois Fighting Illini baseball in 1905; at the time, it meant a coach present throughout the season.\nMore recently, the bench coach is a team's second-in-command. The bench coach serves as an in-game advisor to the manager, offering situational advice, and exchanging ideas in order to assist the manager in making strategy decisions along with relaying scouting information from the front office to the players. If the manager is ejected, suspended, or unable to attend a game for any reason, the bench coach assumes the position of acting manager. If the manager is fired or resigns during the season, it is usually the bench coach who gets promoted to interim manager. The bench coach's responsibilities also include helping to set up the day's practice and stretching routines before a game, as well as coordinating spring training routines and practices.\nPitching and bullpen coaches.\nA pitching coach mentors and trains teams' pitchers. Pitching coaches can alter a pitcher's arm angle, placement on the pitching rubber or pitch selection in order to improve the player's performance. The coach advises the manager on the condition of pitchers and their arms, and serves as an in-game coach for the pitcher currently on the mound. When a manager makes a visit to the mound, he or she typically is doing so to make a pitching change or to discuss situational defense. A pitching coach also helps pitchers with their mechanics and pitch selection against specific batters who may be coming up. However, to talk about mechanics or how to pitch to a particular batter, the pitching coach is the one who will typically visit the mound. The pitching coach is generally a former pitcher. One exception is Dave Duncan, the former pitching coach of the St. Louis Cardinals, who was a catcher. Prior to the early 1950s, pitching coaches were usually former catchers.\nThe bullpen coach is similar to a pitching coach, but works primarily with relief pitchers in the bullpen. Bullpen coaches do not make mound visits; rather, they stay in the bullpen the entire game, working with relievers who are warming up to enter the game, while also offering advice on pitching mechanics and pitch selection. Generally, the bullpen coach is either a former pitcher or catcher.\nOffensive coaches.\nHitting coach.\nA hitting coach, as the name suggests, works with a team's players to improve their batting techniques and form. They monitor players' swings during the game and over the course of the season, advising them when necessary between at bats on adjustments to make. They also oversee batters' performance during practices, cage sessions, and pre-game batting practice. With the advent of technology, hitting coaches are increasingly utilizing video to analyze their hitters along with scouting the opposing pitchers. Video has allowed hitting coaches to clearly illustrate problem areas in the swing, making the adjustment period quicker for the player being analyzed. This process is typically called video analysis.\nBase coaches.\nTwo on-field coaches are present when the team is batting. Stationed in designated coaches' boxes in foul territory near first and third base are the first-base coach and third-base coach. They assist in the direction of baserunners, help prevent pickoffs, and relay signals sent from the manager in the dugout to runners and batters. While the first-base coach is primarily responsible for the batter as to whether he stops at first base or not, or for a runner already on first, the third-base coach carries more responsibility. Such duties include holding or sending runners rounding second and third bases as well as having to make critical, split-second decisions about whether to try to score a runner on a hit, sacrifice fly or error; additionally, they account for the arm strength of the opposing team's fielder and the speed and position of the baserunner.\nAdditional coaching responsibilities.\nThe bench coach, third-base coach, and first-base coach often are assigned additional responsibility for assisting players in specific areas, particularly defense. Common designations include outfield instructor, infield instructor, catching instructor, and baserunning instructor. When a coaching staff is assembled, the selection of the first-base coach is frequently made with the purpose of filling a gap in these coaching responsibilities, as the actual in-game duties of a first-base coach are relatively light.\nOther coaches.\nTeams may also employ individuals to work with players in other areas or activities. These positions sometimes include the word \"coach\" in their titles. Individuals holding these positions usually do not dress in uniform during games, as the number of uniformed coaches is restricted by Major League Baseball rules. The most prominent of these positions are the athletic trainer and the strength and conditioning coach. All Major League Baseball teams employ an athletic trainer; most employ a strength and conditioning coach. Other positions include bullpen catcher and batting practice pitcher. Some teams also employ additional coaches without specific responsibilities.\nMinor and amateur leagues.\nMajor League Baseball teams will have one person specifically assigned to each coaching position described above. However, minor league and amateur teams typically have coaches fulfill multiple responsibilities. A typical minor league/amateur team coaching structure will have a manager, a pitching coach, and a hitting coach, each of whom also assumes the responsibilities of the first- and third-base coaches, bullpen coach, etc. In U.S. college baseball, the title \"manager\" is not used; the person who fills the role of a professional manager is instead called the \"head coach\".\nYouth baseball.\nResponsibilities of a youth baseball coach include providing a safe environment for everyone. A coach is responsible for inspecting fields and equipment that is used for practice and competition to ensure it is safe. Communication is key when dealing with youth baseball as being positive to other coaching staff, umpires, administrators and others shows that they have a players best interest at heart. Coaches are there not to just work with the stars to get them better but everyone so it is a fair learning experience. Teaching the fundamental skills of baseball is important as a youth coach because in the end baseball is a game, therefore coaches want players to have fun. Having a fun but productive practice environment is important. The rules of baseball are necessary in youth baseball. Many rules such as sliding, the strike zone, and defensive rules are needed."

Douglas was also a rugby referee, and officiated over four international matches.\nRugby career.\nDouglas played club rugby for Canton RFC and Cardiff RFC, and in the 1885–86 season he succeeded Frank Hancock as the senior club captain. Douglas was first selected to play for the Welsh national team as part of the 1886 Home Nations Championship in the opening game against England. The team was captained by Newport's Charlie Newman and Douglas was one of three Cardiff players gaining their first cap in the game. Although Wales lost the game, the margin was low and Douglas was re-selected for the very next Welsh international, this time to Scotland. Wales lost this game, but due to a dispute with Ireland failed to complete all the matches in the tournament. In the next year's tournament Douglas was selected for the first two games. The first was a drawn game against England at Llanelli, the country's best result to date against the English. His fourth and final game was the team's second game of the 1887 Championship, away to Scotland, which Wales again lost.\nFour years after the end of his international playing career, Douglas began his international refereeing career. Douglas was chosen to referee the 1891 Home Nations Championship match between Ireland and England at Lansdowne Road. His second match as referee was in 1894, in a match between England and Ireland played this time at the Rectory Field. His final two international games as a referee were both between England and Scotland, in 1896 and 1903. The 1903 match was of particular note, as it saw the only appearance of Scotland's John Dallas, who also scored a try in the game. Dallas would himself go on to referee at international level, in the infamous 1905 game between Wales and New Zealand.\nInternational games played.\nWales"

It is located on a floodplain on the inside of a bend in the Red Cedar River known traditionally as Old College Field (opened in 1902) and is the home field for the Michigan State University Spartans college baseball team. The facility received a $4.3 million renovation in 2009. The field itself is named after former MSU baseball coach John Kobs (named for him in 1969), and the stadium facility is named after former Houston Astros owner and Michigan State alumnus Drayton McLane Jr., whose donation in 2008 allowed for the renovation of the new facility.\nThe first official game in the newly renovated stadium was played on April 4, 2009. Spartan pitcher Nolan Moody threw a no-hitter against Northwestern University. It marked MSU's first no-hitter in 16 years.\nIn the summer of 2015, McLane Stadium at Kobs Field had a new electric field heating system installed by Sports Fields, Inc., becoming the first baseball field in the world with the state-of-the-art system.\nThe numbers of five former players have been honored by the Spartans and hang on the right field fence: No. 36 Robin Roberts, No. 30 Kirk Gibson, No. 10 Steve Garvey, No. 5 Tom Yewcic and No. 13 Mark Mulder. Also honored are No. 25, worn by coach John Kobs and No. 1 worn by coach Danny Litwhiler.\nHigh school and amateur baseball games also take place at Kobs Field. It was the largest baseball stadium in the Lansing area until the completion of Oldsmobile Park.\nPrior to the 2005 renovation, seating at Kobs Field consisted of wooden bleachers with capacity of about 2,000, dating from shortly after World War II. Considerable open space outside the foul lines allowed standing room crowds in excess of 5,000 on isolated occasions."

        "title": "Rugby Western Relief Road",
        "text": "The Rugby Western Relief Road (RWRR) is a single carriageway bypass road which is on the outskirts of Rugby, Warwickshire, England. The £36.6 million scheme includes a £17.08 million contribution from the Department for Transport and was expected to be completed by the end of 2009 but the date was put back by a year, eventually opening in September 2010. There was also much speculation that the project went well over budget.\nPlanning and pre-construction.\nPublic consultation regarding the roads was started in November 1997 about a decade before construction began and ended two months later in January 1998. The original road plan had it running through Cawston and not around it but the extra funding was quickly found to change this. In September 2002 Rugby Borough Council had finalised and submitted their plans which were accepted in October that year. In December 2005 the Department for Transport approved Compulsory Purchase and Side Roads Orders, albeit with slight modifications to the plan regarding the extreme southern end of the road. The construction company Carillion, who have also worked on the M6 toll and the 2009 M6 extension, were awarded the contract.\nSpecial consideration has been taken to reduce the environmental impact of the new road. Since 2002 the County Council and Carillion worked with Penny Anderson Associates Limited to protect local wildlife, especially local bats and badgers. Elsewhere over 15,000 trees were due to be planted and of new hedgerows laid. of wildflowers would be planted and several 'balancing pools' dug to try to help cancel out the negative environmental impact of the new road.\nRoute and construction.\nThe road leaves the existing A4071 just west of the village of Cawston, itself just outside Rugby. From there it skirts the western side of the town, crossing the A428 in New Bilton before cutting through the north of the town to join the A426 which in turn joins the M6 motorway just north of the town.\nWork was begun in August 2007, nearly ten years after public consultation began. After months of building temporary service routes, major earthworking started in May 2008 along the southern section of the road. By the start of September that year tarmac was starting to be laid on this section and earthworking was starting elsewhere. For the rest of the year the roundabout at the south end of the road, along with strengthening of existing bridges started. In January 2009 industrial contaminants were found on a part of the proposed route on land formerly owned by Cemex, one of whose plants are next to the road. These however were quickly identified and removed. In March 2009 a roundabout was completed on the A4071 which takes drivers off it and onto the Relief Road. During construction local school children and interested members of the public were able to have planned visits to the site.\nIn July 2009 the bridge that took the Lawford Road over the disused railway was taken down and the Lawford Road was diverted to make way for what became the largest signalised junction in Warwickshire. In November 2009 the southern section from the A4071 to the Lawford Road was waiting to be topped off. Further north up the route the earthworks were completed.\nOn 19 June 2010 the southern section of the road from Potford's Dam to Lawford Road opened to traffic. This was preceded by a charity open day of the route allowing local people to explore the route in safety. The remainder of the route was opened on 10 September 2010.\nEffects of road.\nA study was carried out in September 2011 by Warwickshire County Council to discover what effect the new road was having on traffic levels on other roads it was built to relieve. The results indicated that traffic on Bilton Lane had dropped by 79 per cent, the A4071 Main Street in Bilton was down 28 per cent, the number of vehicles using the A426 Newbold Road had fallen by 26 per cent, and the A428 at Church Lawford was down 14 per cent.

From 2005, the Harry Jepson trophy was solely for the winners of the RLC Premier divisions. Conference sides that remained in the regional divisions competed for a new trophy - the RLC Regional. The Harry Jepson trophy is still contested by teams from RLC successor leagues.\nThe RLC Challenge was a knock-out competition designed to give clubs meaningful pre-season games.\nThe RLC Shield was an optional secondary competition for RLC Regional sides not making their divisions' play-offs. It was first contested in 2002 and continued until 2005.\nNational League Three was absorbed into the Rugby League Conference as the Rugby League Conference National Division in 2007.\nThe Welsh Shield was a secondary Welsh competition for teams which did not make the play-offs for the Welsh Division. It was played for in 2004 and 2005. The Welsh premier division was split into two divisions: East and West in 2006, though this was reversed for the following season. A play-off determined the overall Welsh champion."

He is the former head football coach at Lafayette College, a position he assumed December 21, 2016 after spending one season as the offensive coordinator for the University of Richmond. He was also a professional American football wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cincinnati Bengals and in the World League of American Football (WLAF) for the San Antonio Riders. He played college football at Columbia University and Princeton University.\nEarly years.\nGarrett was born in Danville, Pennsylvania. He attended University School in Hunting Valley, Ohio, where he played wide receiver under head coach Cliff Foust. He graduated in 1983.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Columbia University in 1983. His father Jim Garrett became the football head coach in 1985. Garrett sat out the 1985 season because of an injury he suffered in the preseason camp, and decided to drop out of college to save a season of football eligibility.\nFollowing his father's resignation after Columbia's 0–10 record, he and his brothers (Jason and Judd) transferred to Princeton University. He sat out the 1986 season to comply with the NCAA transfer rules, while playing on the scout team, which included both of his brothers.\nAs a senior in 1987, he led the team with 45 receptions for 617 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. He returned 18 kickoffs for 359 yards and 20 punts for 87 yards. He also began the season as a backup defensive back. He also practiced junior varsity baseball.\nIn 1988, he graduated from Princeton with a degree in history, with a senior thesis on \"The American Football League: Its Rivalry with the National Football League and its Impact on Professional Football\".\nProfessional career.\nGarrett was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1988 NFL Draft.

        "text": "David Robbins (born September 10, 1942) is a retired American basketball coach. Robbins is best known for coaching at NCAA Division II power Virginia Union University, where he won 713 games and three NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament titles. Out of all NCAA coaches who have won more than 700 wins, Robbins is the second winningest coach with a winning percentage of 0.786 (713 wins, 194 losses). He is second only to Adolph Rupp who had a winning percentage of 0.822. Jerry Tarkanian, Dean Smith, Steve Moore, Roy Williams, Bill Self, Mike Krzyzewski, John Calipari, and Bo Ryan make up the remaining top ten. Seven out of 10 of those coaches have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Robbins, Moore, and Ryan have not.\nRobbins announced his retirement on April 15, 2008. He is a member of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2012. \nEarly life.\nRobbins grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina and played football, basketball, and ran track at Ashley High School. He was recruited to play basketball at Catawba College, but also played football and ran track. Robbins coached at Thomas Jefferson High School in Richmond, Virginia where he led his 1975 team to the AAA State Championship prior to moving to Virginia Union University in 1978.\nCollege coaching career.\nRobbins began coaching the Virginia Union Panthers in 1978, becoming the first white head coach in the history of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA), a conference consisting of Historically black colleges and universities. His hiring was highly controversial as many saw the hiring of a white coach as taking away opportunities from African-American candidates.\nDuring his 30-year career, Robbins led his teams to a record of 713-194 and three NCAA Division II National Championships in 1980, 1992 and 2005. His teams won 14 CIAA championships and garnered 21 NCAA tournament appearances.

He also owned the Philadelphia Phillies of the short-lived National Football League of 1902.\nRogers was born to Irish immigrant parents in Philadelphia on May 27, 1844. He earned his law degree at the University of Pennsylvania, and was admitted to the bar in 1865. Rogers was elected the city comptroller in 1880. As a member of the City Troop/(First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry), he participated in the quelling of the Pittsburgh riots during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. Rogers was later appointed Judge Advocate General of the Philadelphia National Guard, with the rank of colonel.\nA prominent attorney and politician in Philadelphia, Rogers came to the baseball business when former player and sporting goods magnate Al Reach consulted with him on a patent for a baseball. Rogers and Reach later teamed up to acquire the remnants of the Worcester Worcesters in 1883, winning the rights to the franchise via drawing of lots. Reach and Rogers relocated the franchise to Philadelphia, where they became known as the Quakers (they would later become the Phillies), entering the team as an expansion franchise in the National League in 1883. During these early days, Rogers was involved in creating baseball's reserve clause, which would remain in effect until the era of free agency.\nReach and Rogers sold the Phillies to a group led by James Potter in February 1903, but retained the rights to the team's stadium, National League Park (which eventually became Baker Bowl). On August 8, a balcony collapsed at the park, killing 12 people and injuring hundreds more. Rogers was nearly ruined by the resulting avalanche of lawsuits, and was forced to sell the stadium to Potter as well. Eventually, both Rogers and Reach were absolved of blame and financial responsibility for the accident by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nRogers died of heart failure in Denver, Colorado on March 13, 1910."

        "title": "Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "Argentina v England was a football match played on 22 June 1986 between Argentina and England in the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The game was held four years after the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and was a key part in the already intense Argentina–England football rivalry. It was also a match which included two of the most well-known goals in football history, both scored by Argentina captain Diego Maradona.\nThe first goal, after 51 minutes, was the \"Hand of God goal,\" which Maradona scored by using his hand. The second, four minutes after his first, saw him dribble past five England players, Peter Beardsley, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, Terry Fenwick, Butcher (again), and finally goalkeeper Peter Shilton, and became known as the \"Goal of the Century.\" Argentina won the game 2–1 and went on to win the 1986 World Cup with a victory over West Germany in the final match. Maradona won the golden ball for player of the tournament; England's goalscorer on the day, Gary Lineker, won the golden boot for being the tournament's top scorer.\nBackground.\nArgentina–England football rivalry.\nThe rivalry between the England and Argentina national football teams is generally traced back to the 1966 FIFA World Cup. During the quarter-final game at Wembley Stadium, the home of the England national team, Argentine captain Antonio Rattin was sent off as Argentina lost in a game which contained excessive foul play. Rattin was angered at the sending-off, feeling that the German referee Rudolf Kreitlein, who did not speak Spanish, had been biased towards the English, a fellow European nation, in front of their home fans, and stamped over the royal carpet in the stadium. This led England manager Alf Ramsey to describe the Argentines as \"animals\", comments that were viewed as racist by the Argentines.\nDespite the popularity of Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, Argentines who played with Tottenham Hotspur in England in an era before it was commonplace for clubs to have non-British players, the rivalry remained strong.\nFalklands War.\nOutside football, the Falklands War in 1982 increased the mistrust between England and Argentina. Britain administers the Falkland Islands, a small archipelago in the South Atlantic, as a British overseas territory; Argentina claims the islands as Islas Malvinas. On 2 April 1982, Argentina's forces invaded the islands. Britain considered this an invasion of its territory and sent a naval task force that recaptured the Islands on 15 June 1982. Though the two nations were never officially at war, the conflict resulted in 285 British and 659 Argentine deaths. As a result, the match taking place four years after the war was emotionally charged. Following the game, Maradona stated: \"Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.\"\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nThe 1986 FIFA World Cup was held in Mexico after the original hosts, Colombia, were unable to host the tournament. England qualified for the finals undefeated, topping Group 3 in the UEFA zone; Argentina also topped their qualifying group in CONMEBOL. In the early stages of the tournament, Argentina had been comfortable, winning two and drawing one in the group stage. England had qualified more narrowly, with a 3–0 win over Poland in the final match putting them into the round of 16. Both teams won comfortably against South American opposition in that round, Argentina against Uruguay and England against Paraguay. Although neither team began the tournaments as favourites, England's form had been improving throughout the World Cup and Argentina were buoyed by the skill of Maradona.\nArgentina kit change.\nArgentina beat Uruguay 1–0 in the round of 16 wearing blue cotton shirts that coach Carlos Bilardo believed would prove too uncomfortable in the searing Mexico City heat. Bilardo asked Argentina's kit manufacturer to come up with lighter blue shirts for the quarter-final, an impossible request given the short deadline. With three days to go before the match, he sent out Ruben Moschella, a member of his coaching staff, to scour the shops of the Mexican capital for a suitable kit. He returned with two different blue shirts, which they subsequently weighed but were unable to choose between. It was then that Diego Maradona appeared and said: \"That’s a nice jersey. We’ll beat England in that.\" Moschella returned to the shop and bought 38 of the shirts for the side to wear against England. A designer fashioned some makeshift Argentine Football Association (AFA) badges, which were then sewn on to each jersey opposite the logo of Le Coq Sportif, which provided kits for Argentina at the time, with silvery American football shirt numbers hurriedly ironed on to the backs.\nPrevious incidents.\nBefore the 1986 game fans from both countries had a fight in Mexico City streets and into the stadium too. As a result, several English fans were hospitalised while some of their flags were stolen by Argentine barra bravas. Those flags would be then exhibited by Boca Juniors's supporters during some Argentine league matches.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nThe game started with both teams exchanging chances. Argentina began to dominate, with England's goalkeeper Peter Shilton saving several good chances, many created by Maradona. Peter Beardsley had England's best chance after 13 minutes, following a slip from Nery Pumpido in Argentina's goal, but failed to take it. At half time, the score was 00, Argentina having had much more of the possession and territory – and done a great deal more of the running – but having failed to get through England's defence.\nSecond half.\nIt was the second half of the match that was to see the two incidents for which the game was to become both famous and infamous.\nThe \"Hand of God\".\nSix minutes into the second half, Maradona cut inside from the left and played a diagonal low pass to the edge of the area to teammate Jorge Valdano and continued his run in the hope of a one-two movement. Maradona's pass was played slightly behind Valdano and reached England's Steve Hodge, the left midfielder who had dropped back to defend.\nHodge tried to hook the ball clear but miscued it. The ball looped off his foot and into the penalty area, toward Maradona, who had continued his run. England goalkeeper Peter Shilton came out of his goal to punch the ball clear. Maradona, despite being 8 inches (20 cm) shorter than the 6-foot-1 (1.85 m) Shilton, reached it first with his outside left hand. The ball bounced into the goal. Referee Ali Bin Nasser of Tunisia said he did not see the infringement and allowed the goal.\nMaradona later said, \"I was waiting for my teammates to embrace me, and no one came... I told them, 'Come hug me, or the referee isn't going to allow it.'\"\nAt the post-game press conference, Maradona facetiously commented that the goal was scored \"un poco con la cabeza de Maradona y otro poco con la mano de Dios\" (\"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God\"), after which it became known as the \"Hand of God\" goal. The goal helped intensify the footballing rivalry between the two nations. Cesar Luis Menotti said, \"People said, 'Great! Better, much better, that the goal was so unjust, so cruel, because it hurt the English more.'\" In the 2019 documentary film directed by Asif Kapadia, Maradona linked the event to the Falklands War: \"We, as Argentinians, didn't know what the military was up to. They told us that we were winning the war. But in reality, England was winning. It was tough. The hype made it seem like we were going to play out another war. I knew it was my hand. It wasn't my plan but the action happened so fast that the linesman didn't see me putting my hand in. The referee looked at me and he said: 'Goal.' It was a nice feeling like some sort of symbolic revenge against the English.\"\nThe Goal of the Century.\nFour minutes after the \"Hand of God\" goal came a second goal as the ball was passed to Maradona inside his own half. Maradona then began his 60-yard, 10-second dash towards the English goal, passing four English outfield players: Peter Beardsley, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher (twice) and Terry Fenwick. Maradona finished the move with a feint that left goalkeeper Peter Shilton on his bottom, before slotting the ball into the empty net to make the score 2–0 to Argentina.\nAbout the goal, Maradona said to reporters, \"I made the play to give it to Valdano, but when I got to the area they surrounded me and I had no space. Therefore, I had to continue the play and finish it myself.\" He later complimented the fair play of the English team, saying, \"I don't think I could have done it against any other team because they all used to knock you down; they are probably the noblest in the world\".\nIn 2002, the goal was voted 'Goal of the Century' as part of the buildup to the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament on the FIFA website. It beat a goal scored by England's Michael Owen against Argentina in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, which came second, whilst another 1986 FIFA World Cup goal by Maradona, from the semi-final match against Belgium, came fourth.\nIn Spanish-speaking countries, this goal is usually associated with the passionate live commentary by Uruguayan journalist Víctor Hugo Morales (translation from Spanish):\nLineker's goal and Argentine victory.\nArgentina's 2–0 lead forced England into a double-attacking substitution, bringing on Barnes and Waddle, and it nearly paid off: as the Argentine team began to tire after their earlier efforts, England began to push further up the pitch, looking to get back into the game. Driven by Glenn Hoddle and John Barnes, they created chances, and Gary Lineker scored his sixth goal of the tournament in the 81st minute from a Barnes cross. Argentina had further chances as well, with Carlos Tapia hitting the inside of the post immediately after England's goal. England were unable to score an equaliser and Argentina won the match 2–1.\nAftermath and legacy.\nHodge swapped shirts with Maradona after the game; Hodge lent out the Argentine's jersey to the National Football Museum in the 2000s. The game added hugely to the rivalry between the two teams. In Argentina, the game was seen as revenge for the Falklands War and for what they still see as the unfair game in the 1966 World Cup. The former Argentine international Roberto Perfumo stated that \"In 1986, winning that game against England was enough. Winning the World Cup was secondary for us. Beating England was our real aim\".\nThe majesty of Maradona's second goal, the solo run from midfield, and the notoriety of his first, the \"hand of God\", saw the French newspaper \"L'Équipe\" describe him as \"half-angel, half-devil\". Although the first goal proved highly controversial in England, Maradona's second goal was nevertheless recognized all over the world for its brilliance. A notable example of the English appreciation of his genius occurred in a 2002 poll conducted by Channel 4, where the UK public voted Maradona's performance sixth in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. Outside the Estadio Azteca a statue of Maradona scoring the goal was erected to commemorate the moment.\nArgentina went on to win the 1986 FIFA World Cup by defeating West Germany in the final match, as well as finishing runners-up in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. England's Lineker won the Golden Boot for being top scorer in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. With a similar squad, England finished fourth in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, their highest finish since 1966.\nThe two teams have since met twice in World Cup matches. Argentina won a round-of-16 match in the shootout at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, after one penalty kick was awarded to each side, David Beckham was sent off, Sol Campbell had a goal disallowed and Michael Owen scored his famous goal. At the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the teams met in the group stage, and the match, which began at 12:30 PM UK time, was described as the \"longest lunch break in history\" as millions in England stopped their jobs and activities to watch the game on TV. England won 1–0 courtesy of a foul by Mauricio Pochettino on Michael Owen. Beckham's penalty kick won the match for England and Argentina later failed to advance to the knockout round.\nOn 17 August 2015, Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser, the referee of the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, at his home in Tunisia, and paid tribute to him by giving him an Argentine jersey bearing his signature, and referred to him as \"my eternal friend\".\nIn April 2022, it was announced that the shirt worn by Maradona in that match would be auctioned by multinational company Sotheby's. The shirt was property of England's Steve Hodge, who exchanged shirts with Maradona at the end of the match. Hodge kept the piece for over 16 years until he lent it to the National Football Museum in Manchester to be exhibited there. The shirt was estimated to sell for more than £4 million (US$5.25 million).\nOn 4 May, the shirt was sold for £7,142,500 (US$9.2 million), according to Sothebys' sources. The price fetched a new record for an item of sports memorabilia."

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Cross Keys RFC, as a number eight, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain, Wales and Other Nationalities, and at club level for Leeds, as a , or , i.e. number 8 or 10, 11 or 12, or 13, during the era of contested scrums, he died in Leeds.\nBack.\nJoe Thompson was born in Hambrook, Gloucestershire, born of English parents he was raised from infancy in Crosskeys, Monmouthshire, and he died aged 80 in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.\nPlaying career.\nIn 1923, aged 20, Joe Thompson became a Dual-code rugby international, first playing in the Wales (RU) team at Twickenham Stadium, and later that year for Wales (RL) in the rugby league international at the Fartown Ground, Huddersfield.\nInternational honours.\nJoe Thompson won a cap for Wales (RU) while at Cross Keys RFC in 1923 against England, won caps for Wales (RL) while at Leeds 8-caps, won caps for Other Nationalities (RL) while at Leeds 5-caps, and won caps for Great Britain while at Leeds in 1924 against Australia, and New Zealand (2 matches), in 1928 against Australia, and New Zealand, in 1929 against Australia, and in 1932 against Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (3 matches).\nRugby career.\nJoe Thompson played soccer until his late teens but a short time after trying rugby union he was playing in the Cross Keys RFC first team. While with Cross Keys, Joe Thompson was selected to play for the Welsh national rugby union team in the opening match of the 1923 Five Nations Championship. Wales lost the game 7–3 and this match was the only cap Joe Thompson won under rugby union rules.\nRugby league career.\nIn February 1923 he signed for Leeds playing in the . He had worked as a coal miner since the age of 13, a background that had no doubt hardened him. He was a fearless tackler and a powerful runner with terrific ball handling skills, unusual for a forward of that period. More surprising still was his masterly command of goal-kicking, with 862 goals in eleven seasons playing for Leeds. Joe Thompson played right-, i.e. number 12, and scored 5-goals in the 28–3 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1922–23 Challenge Cup Final during the 1922–23 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield, the only occasion the Challenge Cup final has ever been staged at Belle Vue. He was the 1927–28 season's top point scorer with 233. He was the 1929–30 season's top point scorer with 243. In all first class games he landed 921 goals and scored over 2,000 points. With 1,883-points, Joe Thompson is third in the Leeds' all-time points scoring list, behind Kevin Sinfield (3967-points), and Lewis Jones (3,372-points).\nIn Test matches Joe Thompson was on the winning side on eight occasions in 12 appearances, with the distinction of selection for Australian tours in 1924, 1928 and 1932. In the history of tours to Australasia the only forward to equal this was Brian Edgar of Workington Town. On each of Thompson's three tours Britain came home with The Ashes. The 1932 tour was his apotheosis, playing in a star-studded pack in all six Tests in Australia and New Zealand. This included the infamous second Australian Test, enshrined in Rugby League history as the \"Battle of Brisbane\" with nine players suffering serious injury. In New Zealand all three Tests were won and on the whole tour only two of 26 games were lost.\nJoe Thompson was capped 25 times; 12 internationals for Great Britain (RL), eight for Wales (RL) and five for Other Nationalities (RL).\nOn his retirement in April 1933 Leeds paid him the rare honour of making him a life member of the club.\nCareer records.\nJoe Thompson is one of less than ten Welshmen to have scored more than 2,000 points in their rugby league career.\nContemporaneous Article Extract.\n\"Never was there a man less likely to have his head turned by fame or flattery. His approach to life was like his approach to football – simple, direct, thoughtful and sincere. There was something reassuringly solid about that massive figure, that firmly moulded beak of a nose and that determined, jutting jaw. Joe Thompson was dependability itself. From the day at Twickenham Stadium when their scouts saw a young forward from Cwmcarn walk to the touchline, spit out a few broken teeth, and then go back into the game as though it was nothing at all out of the ordinary, Leeds knew that they were on a good thing.\""

Stated below are the names of some of the well known destinations for rock climbing in India to give one a better idea of the places where they can engage in this game.\nSouthern India.\nBadami, a five-hour drive from Bangalore, has many places to go rock climbing. Bangalore is in the center of a number of rock-climbing destinations like Ramanagara (the setting for the Hindi blockbuster Sholay), Ramadevara betta, Savandurga, madhugiri, Thenginkalbetta, Kabbal, SRS betta, and others. Kambakkam at a distance of around from Chennai provides good climbing in many grades while Hampi in Karnataka has some of the best granite rocks in India providing the climbers ample opportunities to test their skills.\nEastern India.\nIn a radius adjoining Calcutta, there are many rock-climbing destinations like Purulia, Matha Bura, Jai Chandi, and Susunia Hills. The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute provides some courses in Mountaineering at Gobu and Tenzing Norgay Rocks.\nWestern India.\nThere are several rock-climbing destinations near Mumbai like Kanheri Caves in the Borivili National Park, Mumbra Boulders, CBD Belapur and Manori Rocks.

        "text": "The Florida Gators women's gymnastics team represents the University of Florida in the sport of gymnastics. The team competes in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Gators host their home matches in the O'Connell Center on the university's Gainesville, Florida campus, and are currently led by head coach Jenny Rowland. The Gators women's gymnastics program has won nine SEC championships, and four national championships: the 1982 AIAW national tournament and the 2013, 2014, and 2015 NCAA championships.\nHistory.\nThe University of Florida first fielded a women's varsity gymnastics team in the fall of 1973. Gymnastics was one of the first women's sports added at the University of Florida and achieved early success by winning the 1982 Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) championship (the AIAW was the governing body for women's college sports from 1971 to 1982). Since the NCAA assumed sponsorship for women's sports championships in 1982, Florida has advanced to the NCAA championships (top twelve) every year but one. The Gators have advanced to the \"Super Six\" finals of the NCAA championships nineteen times. Florida has finished twice as runner-up (1998 and 2012) and won NCAA championships in 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nErnestine Weaver was the head coach of the Gators gymnastics program from 1980 to 1992 and was responsible for much of the team's early success in AIAW, NCAA, and SEC competition. Under Weaver, the Gators won five SEC championships, the AIAW national championship in 1982, and appeared in thirteen consecutive NCAA championships; Gators gymnasts won five AIAW and NCAA individual national championships. Judi Markell succeeded Weaver as head coach in 1993 and her teams qualified for nine NCAA championships in ten seasons, including three Super Six appearances and a second-place finish in 1998; Markell's Gators won three individual national championships.\nThe Gators were coached by Rhonda Faehn from 2003-2015; they won four SEC championships and appeared in the NCAA championships every year, including ten Super Six appearances, a national runner-up performance in 2012, and three straight national championships from 2013-2015. The 2014 NCAA championship team scored the highest total ever at an NCAA championship with a 198.175. Faehn's Gators won nine individual national championships. Marissa King won the vault title in 2011, Kytra Hunter won the all-around and vault title in 2012 and the all-around and floor titles in 2015, Alaina Johnson won the uneven bars title in 2013, and Bridget Sloan won the all-around and balance beam titles in 2013 and the uneven bars title in 2014.\nAfter Faehn's resignation following the 2015 national championship, Florida hired Auburn assistant Jenny Rowland to be the new head coach. In Jenny's first year as head coach she led the Gators to their 10th SEC title and fourth in seven years.\nIndividual national champions.\nTwelve Florida Gators gymnasts have won a total of thirty-one individual national college championships, including Ann Woods (1982 AIAW all-around, floor exercise, uneven bars), Lynn McDonnell (1982 AIAW balance beam), Maria Anz (1984 NCAA floor exercise), Susan Hines (1997 NCAA vault; 1998 NCAA vault), Betsy Hamm (1998 NCAA balance beam), Marissa King (2011 NCAA vault), Kytra Hunter (2012 NCAA all-around and vault title, 2015 all-around and floor title), Alaina Johnson (2013 NCAA Bars), Bridget Sloan (2013 NCAA all-around, beam; 2014 NCAA Bars; 2016 NCAA All-Around, Bars, and Beam), Alex McMurtry (2017 NCAA all-around and bars; 2018 NCAA vault), Alicia Boren (2019 NCAA Floor), and Trinity Thomas (2022 NCAA all-around, floor exercise, and uneven bars).\nRoster.\nFuture recruits.\nBelow are gymnasts who have committed to Florida.\n2024–25 Commits\nAll-American selections.\nAll-American selections through the 2012 season.\nRegular Season All-American Awards.\nThe National Association of Collegiate Gymnastics Coaches (NAGCS) started awarding All-American honors for a gymnast's regular season performance.

        "title": "Lacrosse in Pennsylvania",
        "text": "Lacrosse has been played in Pennsylvania since the 19th century. There are many amateur programs at the club, college, and high school level, as well as several past and present professional teams in the National Lacrosse League (NLL) and Major League Lacrosse (MLL).\nCollege lacrosse in Pennsylvania.\nCollege lacrosse beginnings.\nThe first lacrosse team in North America was the Montreal Lacrosse Club, established in Montreal, Quebec, Canada by dentist, Dr. William George Beers. A demonstration of lacrosse was given by the Caughnawaga Indians in Montreal in 1834, which resulted in growing interest by Canadian settlers. By the 1850s, Beers codified the game by adding rules and structure. Beers also petitioned for lacrosse to be named Canada's national sport, which led to the formation of the National Lacrosse Association. Montreal Lacrosse Club created the first set of written rules of the game of lacrosse. In 1860, Beers wrote up the codes, rules of the game, reducing the length of games and limiting the number of players to 12 per side. The first game played under these new rules was at Upper Canada College in 1867, where Upper Canada lost to the Toronto Cricket Club 3–1.\nIntercollegiate lacrosse in the United States can trace its roots to 1877 when New York University beat Manhattan College two to zero. Also in 1877, the Boston Lacrosse Club started up at Harvard, though a true varsity team at Harvard was not established until 1880. In 1879, the United States Amateur Lacrosse Association was formed by John R. Flannery, a well-known Canadian club player to coordinate the efforts of private, amateur lacrosse clubs in several Northeast cities, including one club that formed in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Flannery had grown up in Canada, been a member of the Montreal Shamrocks Lacrosse Club, and subsequently moved to the United States where he played for a number of amateur east coast clubs. In 1878 he organized a game billed as the National Championship between Union Lacrosse Club and Ravenswood Lacrosse Club of New York City. Encouraged by the turnout of some 40,000 spectators, Flannery set about organizing the disparate lacrosse clubs into a cohesive organization. Ravenswood Lacrosse Club with John Flannery went on to influence lacrosse at several other colleges, playing a well-publicized game against New York University in 1879.\nIn 1881, the first true varsity level intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held, with Harvard defeating Princeton in the final, 3–0. This series led to the formation of a league in 1882, known as the Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association (the ICLA, later the ILA), which included New York University, Columbia, Princeton and Harvard. At the same time, Flannery's United States Amateur Lacrosse Association comprised eleven college and club teams, but by 1886 the number of clubs had risen to greater than 40. College organizations, including a varsity team at Lehigh University, soon were seeking admittance to the ILA. Lehigh fielded its first varsity squad in 1885, with the University of Pennsylvania, and Lafayette College at the club level, following suit in 1890. Lehigh and Swarthmore were accepted as members in the ILA in 1888 and 1891, respectively.\nThe first tournament for lacrosse supremacy during this period was known as the Oelrichs Cup, sponsored by Hermann Oelrichs, and first offered up in a tournament format in 1881. Oelrichs was the first president of the United States National Amateur Lacrosse Association, a precursor to the USILA, and he was a member of the New York Lacrosse Club. The Oelrichs Cup was played for much of the 1880s, played mostly by amateur non-scholastic clubs though Princeton did field a tournament team. Arnold K. Reese as part of a powerful Baltimore lacrosse club, won the Oelrichs Cup in 1890. At this time also, Reese had been the main force behind starting up varsity lacrosse at Lehigh. Reese's efforts would lead to Lehigh being one of the early college lacrosse powers. Reese played for Lehigh from 1888 to 1891, winning an ILA title in 1890.\nDevelopment of USILA.\nIn 1898 another league, the Inter-University Lacrosse League (IULL) was formed playing with slightly different rules, with Harvard, Columbia and Cornell as charter members. Many of the member teams of both the ILA and IULL joined, dropped out or rejoined at various times over the years. In December 1905, representatives from all the colleges in the two leagues met in New York and formed the United States Inter-Collegiate Lacrosse League, the USICLL initially, soon to be known as the USILL. The colleges entering into this association were Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Lehigh, Pennsylvania, Stevens and Swarthmore. The USILL acted as the governing body for lacrosse in the United States until it was replaced by the USILA in 1926.\nDuring the first 40 years of organized varsity college lacrosse, known alternately as the ICLA, ILA, USICLL, USILL and USILA, two Pennsylvania schools, Lehigh and Swarthmore fielded dominant teams. The two teams were voted National Champions of college lacrosse a combined fourteen (14) seasons. Glenn \"Pop\" Warner, the Hall of Fame football coach at the Carlisle Indian School (PA) from 1899 to 1903, substituted lacrosse for baseball during the spring season because he said, \"Lacrosse is a developer of health and strength. It is a game that spectators rave over once they understand it.\" It is also likely that lacrosse, a contact sport, helped prepare his football players for the fall season. By 1920, the USILL had expanded to include teams from Syracuse, Rutgers, Penn State and, encouraged by Pop Warner, even considered adding a varsity team at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1920, college lacrosse realigned their association, adding a Southern Division, which included powerful teams from Lehigh, Penn and Swarthmore along with traditional Maryland power Johns Hopkins. The United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA), the organization still in existence today, officially was formed in November 1925.\nAs of 1942, the association had only 23 member colleges at that time. The members of the U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association for the 1942 season were: City College of New York, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Drexel Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Hobart College, Johns Hopkins University, Lafayette College, Loyola College, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Penn State College, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Rutgers University, Stevens Institute of Technology, Swarthmore College, Syracuse University, Union College, United States Military Academy, United States Naval Academy and Yale University.\nCollege lacrosse development in Pennsylvania.\nLehigh fielded its first varsity squad in 1885, with the University of Pennsylvania and Lafayette College at the club level following suit in 1890. Penn played intermittently upon starting up lacrosse and so lists 1900 as their first official season of varsity lacrosse. Penn State played its first intercollegiate game against Penn in 1913. In 1917, Lehigh which had gone undefeated for two straight seasons and had won the Southern division that season, won the USILL championship by defeating Penn in overtime 5 to 4 at Franklin Field in a title matchup. Lehigh had beaten Cornell, the Northern division champions, the prior season to capture a share of the USILL national lacrosse title.\nSwarthmore won four national titles in the early years of lacrosse. Baltimore Hall of Famer, Philip E. Lamb, led Swarthmore to consecutive titles in 1904 and 1905, \"in the days when Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins were the perennial national champs\", according to Lamb's Hall of Fame entry. Also, in 1940 Penn State attempted a college box lacrosse league playing top universities including Yale. An appropriately named College Division dominated lacrosse in the early 1950s, consisting of some 20 undergraduate schools from Rensselaer Polytechnic, Army, Virginia, Navy, Hofstra, Yale, Baltimore University, Maryland, Delaware, Drexel, Princeton, Duke, Washington College, Washington and Lee, Johns Hopkins, Loyola, and Western Maryland as well as two club teams from Mount Washington and Maryland Lacrosse Club. Drexel represented Pennsylvania schools well in 1952 reaching as high as number six in the standings. In the latter part of the 1950s with some 60 colleges playing lacrosse, schools were divided into three divisions. While the 'A Division' included traditional national powers Navy and Johns Hopkins, the 'B Division' and 'C Division' consisted of several potent Pennsylvania universities including Penn, Swarthmore, Penn State, Lehigh, Dickinson, Drexel and Lafayette.\nUniversity level national titles, post-season NCAA play.\nIn total, Lehigh University has won eleven national titles under various pre-NCAA United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association formats for national championships, while Swarthmore University has won five titles.\nMore recently under the NCAA tournament format in place since 1971, Pennsylvania based universities have participated in many NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournaments including Bucknell (2), Cabrini (16), Drexel (1), Franklin &amp; Marshall (5), Gettysburg (25), Lehigh (2), Kutztown (1), Messiah College (2), Penn (12), Penn State (4), Swarthmore (1), Widener (6) and Villanova (2).\nIn the 1988 NCAA tournament, Penn led by Tony Seaman and Chris Flynn were the first Pennsylvania school to reach the semi-finals, losing by one goal to the Gait Brothers led Syracuse Orange, which is as far as any Pennsylvania based Division I school has advanced in tournament play. In all, Penn reached the NCAAs six times in the 1980s, including a quarterfinal appearance in 1987.\nFor the first time in 2011, a Pennsylvania university or college won the NCAA Division II National Title when Mercyhurst defeated Adelphi 9 to 8. Mercyhurst also played in the 2007 Division II national finals, losing a close contest to LeMoyne 6 to 5. Mercyhurst has been to three Division II finals.\nRecent NCAA play.\nAmong recent highlights at the university level, the Penn State Nittany Lions men's team in 2019 was 16 and 2, was seeded number one in the 2019 NCAA tournament, becoming the first ever Pennsylvania team to get the number one NCAA seeding in Men's lacrosse and the second Pennsylvania team to make men's lacrosse Division I Final Four. Also in 2019. Grant Ament set the Division I single season record for assists in a season with 95 assists. In 2005, Penn State was named to the NCAA tournament after reaching number eleven in the national rankings. In 2006 Penn upset #3 Cornell on their way to getting an at-large berth in the NCAA tournament.\nGettysburg has had success in Division III, regularly appearing in the top five national rankings and reaching the NCAA title games in 2001, 2002 and 2009. Philadelphia has hosted six NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament in Divisions I, II &amp; III at Franklin Field and Lincoln Financial Field. In 2009, Villanova defeated Towson in the conference finals to gain the team's first ever NCAA tournament bid. In 2009 Chris Bates head coach for ten years at Drexel took the top job at Princeton.\nIn 2007, Drexel upset number one ranked and defending National Champion Virginia, 11 to 10, scoring the game-winning goal with three seconds remaining. In 2010, Lafayette won their first six games including consecutive upsets over Navy and Bucknell reaching a national ranking of number eight.\nIn 2011, for the first time, three Pennsylvania schools were represented in the 16 team NCAA tournament. Penn and Villanova were selected as at-large tournament picks. Bucknell made the tournament by virtue of an automatic qualifier, winning the Patriot league tournament, they took eventual champion Virginia to overtime before losing their first-round game. In 2012 Lehigh was seeded number seven in the NCAA tournament, the first seeded Pennsylvania team since Penn was seeded number four in 1988, they took Maryland to late in their first-round game losing on a Terp goal with just six seconds left. Lehigh also won the Patriot League title in 2013, earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, where they lost to UNC. In 2014, Drexel played in their first NCAA tournament and also become the first Pennsylvania Division I school to win an NCAA tournament game since Penn reached the Final Four in 1988. Penn State has received NCAA tournament seedings, in 2017 they were the number seven seed and in 2013 Penn State received the number eight seed in the tournament.\nWomen's university level.\nWomen's lacrosse started up in Scotland at St Leonards School in the 1890s, but was not introduced into the United States until 1926 at The Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. The United States Women's Lacrosse Association was established in 1931. Penn State started up a women's program in 1965 and Lock Haven University in 1969. And in 1971 the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women was founded to govern collegiate women's athletics in the United States and to administer national championships.\nThe most successful programs have been Temple University and Penn State in both the AIAW and NCAA Division I, West Chester University in Division II, as well as Ursinus College and Franklin &amp; Marshall in Division III. Pennsylvania colleges and universities have won a combined 17 USWLA, AIAW and NCAA women's lacrosse national titles.\nTemple won championships in 1984 and 1988; Penn State in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1987 and 1989; West Chester in 2002 and 2008; Ursinus in 1986, 1989 and 1990; and Franklin &amp; Marshall in 2007 and 2009. The Penn State Nittany Lions (women) in 1978, 1979 and 1980 went 45-1-3, won the first 3 national collegiate (USWLA) championships in the sport of women's lacrosse, defeating Maryland, Massachusetts and Maryland, respectively, under head coach Gillian Rattray.\nMarsha Florio of Penn State and Gail Cummings of Temple are currently the 3rd and 4th all-time highest scoring Division I players with 380 and 378 career points, respectively. Stephanie Kienle and Katelyn Martin both of West Chester are the 1st and 2nd highest all-time scoring Division II players with 390 and 376 career points, respectively.\nIn 2009 Franklin &amp; Marshall won the Division III national title defeating Salisbury 11 to 10. In 2011 Gettysburg won the Division III national title defeating Bowdoin 16 to 5. Gettysburg won the title again in 2017.\nHigh school.\nLacrosse development at the private preparatory school or public high school level in Pennsylvania by the mid-1950s had progressed more slowly than at the collegiate level. At that time, Lower Merion High School and Swarthmore High School were among only a handful of Pennsylvania schools offering varsity lacrosse as a spring sport at the high school level, usually playing against college level junior varsity squads.\nBut by 1965, a state high school championship system had been put in place. The Hill School was named the first Pennsylvania prep statewide champion of what became known as the Avery Blake Memorial Trophy. Since 2001, with the expansion of lacrosse programs at high schools throughout the state, a new format, the Keystone Cup, has been played where three state sectional champions meet to determine the statewide champion.\nIn 1973, Sewickley Academy hosted western Pennsylvania's first high lacrosse championship tournament featuring teams from Philadelphia, Detroit and Annapolis. Peet Poillon along with his father started up the lacrosse program at Seneca Valley High School in western Pennsylvania in 2001, with Poillon also scoring 410 career goals. In 2009, Emily Garrity of Strath Haven High School broke the career scoring record for women with 695 total points.\nPennsylvania high schools with the most state lacrosse titles include Lower Merion (7), Ridley (6), Haverford School (5), and Penn Charter (5). In 2008, LaSalle College High won the state title and was ranked fourth in the nation, the highest national ranking of a Pennsylvania prep school up to then. Haverford School regularly appears in the top 15 nationally, and plays recognized programs such as The Gilman and Lawrenceville Schools. Three schools have repeated as champion for three straight years, Harriton High School from 1970 to 1972, Penn Charter from 1974 to 1976 and Ridley from 2001 to 2003. In the 2009 state finals, LaSalle won its second consecutive title in defeating Conestoga High School in its first appearance in the state finals, 7 to 3. LaSalle ended the year ranked 4th in a national poll for the second straight season, while Conestoga finished the year ranked 12th.\nIn 2011, for the first time a Pennsylvania prep school, the Haverford School Fords were named National High School lacrosse champions. The Fords topped the national polls in both the Laxpower.com and Inside Lacrosse rankings, while repeat Pennsylvania Public champions Conestoga finished third and fourth nationally, respectively.\nHaverford was again voted high school/prep national champions in 2015.\nProfessional.\nIn 1974, the original Philadelphia Wings became the first professional lacrosse team to operate out of Pennsylvania. The team included popular Philadelphia Flyer player Doug Favell, and the well-known Gene Hart announcing games for the team, as well as Canadian star John Grant Sr., father of John Grant, Jr. The Wings drew crowds of over 10,000 at the Spectrum and reached the league finals in 1974. The team folded along with the original NLL in 1975.\nIn 1985, a box lacrosse USA/Canada Superseries, an eight-game series, was played at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. This series revitalized interest in box lacrosse and was a precursor to the Major Indoor Lacrosse League and National Lacrosse League.\nThe Philadelphia Wings, one of the original NLL franchises was started up again in 1987 by among others Mike French, was subsequently disbanded, and had the most championships of any NLL team with six. Early on the Wings made an effort to connect with the local community by drafting local talent including Scott Growney from Harriton High School, J.R. Castle from William Penn Charter School, Mark Moschella and Scott Carruthers from Drexel, Chris Flynn from Penn, and Tony Resch from Penn Charter. Strong fan support was evident even in the Wings initial season, where the team averaged over 10,000 fans for their home games in 1987. Lacrosse Hall of Famers Gary Gait, Paul Gait, Tom Marechek and Dallas Eliuk are among the notable players who have been a part of the club.\nThe Pittsburgh Bulls played in the NLL from 1990 to 1993 including players Dave Pietramala and Kevin Bilger, and the Pittsburgh CrosseFire played a single season in 2000 until they relocated to become the Colorado Mammoth. In 2004, the Philadelphia Barrage of Major League Lacrosse moved from Bridgeport and played until 2008 when they folded along with three other teams. In five years of operation, the Barrage won three league championships. The team played its home games at United Sports Training Center in West Bradford Township, Pennsylvania.\nThe NLL once again awarded Philadelphia an NLL franchise for 2018, with this new franchise not associated to the prior Philadelphia franchise, and once more adopting the name Wings.\nThe Premier Lacrosse League (PLL), a field lacrosse league that started play in 2019, held its first championship game at Talen Energy Stadium, now known as Subaru Park, in Chester. The league uses a unique tour-based model, in which all teams (with the exception of those given bye weeks) play at a single venue over a weekend. After the 2020 season, MLL and PLL merged, with the merged league operating under the PLL branding.\nNotable Pennsylvania lacrosse programs.\nToday, the national governing body of lacrosse is US Lacrosse. US Lacrosse services the state of Pennsylvania through three local chapters: the Pittsburgh chapter, the Central Pennsylvania Lacrosse chapter and the Philadelphia Lacrosse Association. All three maintain the Pennsylvania Lacrosse Hall of Fame, which honors the great players, coaches, officials and promoters who have made significant contributions to the game at the professional, college and high school levels in Pennsylvania.\nCollege.\nPennsylvania based College Lacrosse programs have combined for 38 national lacrosse titles, in Men's and Women's lacrosse, Divisions I, II and III, as well as pre-NCAA titles.\nThe latest National Champion winners among Pennsylvania universities were Cabrini winning the 2019 NCAA Division III men's title, Mercyhurst with the 2011 NCAA Division II men's title and Gettysburg with the 2018 NCAA Division III women's title.\nLock Haven University reached the women's Division II finals in 2014 and 2015, losing a close match in 2015, 5–4.\nCombined men's and women's teams.\nNotable college players and coaches from Pennsylvania.\nThe players noted below are those players from the Pennsylvania prep and high school system, who have performed notably in college men's or women's lacrosse. Among the criteria for notability include a player elected to the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame, a player elected to the Pennsylvania Lacrosse Hall of Fame, a player who played a significant role on a national championship team, as well as players who achieved significant statistical measurements at the college level.\nNotable college teams from Pennsylvania.\nThe teams noted below are for universities based in Pennsylvania, who have performed notably in NCAA men's or women's lacrosse."

        "text": "The 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) began on April 8, after the conclusion of the 1979–80 NHL season. This season saw the addition of four teams from the disbanded World Hockey Association (WHA) as expansion franchises, and thus the playoffs were also expanded from 12 to 16 teams. The expanded playoff format allowed two of those former WHA clubs, the Edmonton Oilers and the Hartford Whalers, to make the playoffs in their first season in the NHL.\nThe playoffs concluded on May 24 when the New York Islanders defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5–4 to win the final series four games to two and win the Stanley Cup. It was the Islanders' first Stanley Cup win and was the first of four consecutive Stanley Cup wins.\nChanges.\nWith the league expansion from 17 to 21 teams, the playoffs were also expanded, from a 12-team tournament to a 16-team tournament. The sixteen teams were composed of the four divisional champions plus the top 12 finishers of the remaining 17 teams. The 16 qualifying teams were then seeded based on regular season points, with divisional rankings ignored. Division leaders no longer received first round byes. The teams were seeded 1 through 16, with the top team playing the 16th team in the first round, and so on. In subsequent rounds, matchups were similarly arranged, with the top remaining seed against the lowest remaining seed, and so on. The Preliminary Round was expanded to be a best-of-five set, up from a best-of-three. The Atlanta Flames played their final playoff games in this postseason, and moved to Calgary soon after; the playoffs returned to Atlanta in 2007.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe sixteen teams that qualified for the playoffs are ranked 1–16 based on regular season points.\nPreliminary round.\n(1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (16) Edmonton Oilers.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(2) Buffalo Sabres vs. (15) Vancouver Canucks.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (14) Hartford Whalers.\nThis was the first playoff series meeting between these two teams.\n(4) Boston Bruins vs. (13) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams.

He pitched for the Detroit Tigers from 1978 to 1979, the Oakland Athletics from 1982 to 1983, and the St. Louis Cardinals in 1983. He was originally drafted by the New York Mets in the 18th round of the 1974 MLB Draft, but did not sign with them, instead choosing to attend college at the University of Oregon. With things not working out in Oregon, Baker left school his freshman year and returned to El Cajon, California. Baker regrouped and was masterful in a season with the Grossmont Junior College Baseball team in El Cajon and he signed with the Detroit Tigers as an amateur free agent on May 10, 1976.\nAfter spending part of the 1978 season in the minor leagues, Baker made his major league debut on May 25, 1978. In a contest against the Baltimore Orioles, he pitched 6 innings, striking out six and allowing one earned run as the Tigers lost to the Orioles, 2–1. Baker made 15 appearances for the Tigers, starting ten games, earning two wins, four losses, and an earned run average (ERA) of 4.55. Baker also made 16 appearances for the Evansville Triplets of the American Association, the AAA-level minor league affiliate of the Tigers. In those appearances, Baker made 16 starts, won eight, lost one, threw four complete games, three shutouts, and earned an ERA of 3.21. Baker began the 1979 season as a part of the Tigers rotation as a spot starter. He played 21 games, starting 12 of them. After posting a 1–7 record and a 6.64 ERA, Baker was sent back to Evansville, where he finished out the season. After spending nine games with Evansville in 1980, he was purchased by the Toronto Blue Jays on June 6, 1980.\nBaker spent the rest of the season with the Syracuse Chiefs, the Blue Jays AAA minor league team. He had a 6–5 record with a 3.20 ERA in 17 starts at Syracuse, and the following season Baker had a record of 8 wins and 14 losses. He was released by the Blue Jays on January 28, 1982, and was signed by the Oakland Athletics as a free agent on March 9. Baker spent most of 1982 with the Tacoma Tigers, where he had his best professional season: 13 wins, 5 losses, a 2.48 ERA, and nine complete games. After being called up to the Athletics in September and playing five games, he had his most productive major league season in 1983. He pitched in 35 games in relief for Oakland before he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals on September 2, 1983, for players to be named later (Tom Dozier and Jim Strichek). He played eight games in relief for the Cardinals, his last appearance coming on September 27, 1983. He spent three more years in the minor leagues before retiring."

        "title": "International Baseball Board",
        "text": "The International Baseball Board was founded in 1927 and is the international governing body for traditional British baseball codes. It was founded in 1927 to oversee international fixtures, primarily between England and Wales, which are played at A and B level for men, and at age-group level for boys and historically women's international fixtures. It is not to be confused with the International Baseball Federation, which is the world governing body for the American code of baseball.\nHistory.\nThe first international match between England and Wales was held in 1908, the first women's international match between England and Wales took place in 1926. In 1918 England took on Canada. In July 1921 there were efforts for the establishment of a National Baseball Council, where members of the English Baseball Association and South Wales Baseball Association met to discuss the formation of the new governing body. The IBB was finally established in 1927. One of the first acts of the IBB was to rule on the legality of a player being capped by two different nations. Jim Sullivan was born in Wales and played both rugby league and rugby union. Having turned professional with Wigan, Jim was selected for England's British baseball team in 1928. The IBB ruled that this cap was illegal, as Jim had already been capped by Wales in 1921. Amazingly Sullivan crossed to the American code of baseball in the mid 1930's, for Manchester Blue Sox and Greenfield Giants.\nBy 1960 the IBB was the leading body with responsibility for any changes to the rules first developed by the EBA, and in 1960 schools in England, who had still continued to use smaller bowling box dimensions and other peculiarities, adopted IBB regulations. In 1989 the IBB faced a crises, when reserves of the long used worsted Webber ball were exhausted, following the manufacturer, John Jaques of London, ceasing production.\nStructure.\nIBB has two member organisations, the English Baseball Association and the Welsh Baseball Union. The EBA historically had responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the domestic game and was the body responsible for the creation and development of the original rules of the game. The EBA was formed in 1892, though this was a continuation of the much older National Rounders Association, who created the first codified rules of British baseball, between 1887 and 1888. In 1888 and again in 1893 the South Wales Baseball Association affirmed that the EBA was the \"authority\" on the rules of the game and that they would continue to play to those rules. In March 1922 the first annual meeting of the newly formed Welsh Baseball Union was held at Grange YMCA, succeeding the South Wales Baseball Association. The new body quickly made a visit to Liverpool and noted that “the closer link formed between the English and Welsh baseball authorities would materially help to attain the standard of a national pastime”. In 1922 the Welsh Ladies Baseball League was formed under the WBU and by 1994 had 600 players across 40 clubs."

        "text": "The English Baseball Association (known by the abbreviation EBA) is the governing body of the traditional code of British baseball in England, with responsibility for overseeing all aspects of the domestic game and the body responsible for the creation and development of the original rules of the game. The EBA was formed in 1892, though this was a continuation of the much older National Rounders Association, who created the first codified rules of British baseball, between 1887 and 1888. The EBA is based in Liverpool and is a member of the International Baseball Board.\nHistory.\nThe National Rounders Association were based in Merseyside, England, where in April 1886 they were one of a number of locally based sporting institutions with elected representation onto the directorate of the Liverpool Athletic Grounds Company Ltd. Calls were made to follow the success of other working class sports such as football, on Merseyside, and rugby in Wales to adopt a distinct set of rules and bureaucracy. The National Rounders Association were one of a number of national organisations supported by the National Physical Recreation society, created in 1886 with Herbert Gladstone as President, \"to promote physical recreation amongst the working classes\".\nThe National Rounders Association duly created a new game, drawing on the much older game of rounders but with new rules that they hoped would appeal to adults. With plans to spread this new game across the entire United Kingdom, Gloucester adopted the sport in 1887, with the Gloucester Rounders Association formed in 1888. In a June 1888 edition of the South Wales Daily News, the now codified rules of this new sport were discussed and it was noted that \"the National Rounders Association is the authority\". It was also noted that the National Physical Recreation society had supplied a copy of the rules of this new game to the author and \"the present mode of playing the game is a great improvement on the old style\".\nThe first codified rules of British baseball.\nThe rules of the new game, created by the National Rounders Association were as follows. \"The bases are four, and the runs are made to the right. Eleven is the correct number of players, as at cricket, the bowler, man behind batsmen, longstop, one at each of the bases and cover bases. A regulation bat, not to exceed 30 inches in length or 3 1/2 inches in breadth, is used instead of the 'timmy'. Runs are scored individually to the striker, and collectively to the side; a run for each base that the striker succeeds in reaching without stopping. The ball must be delivered over the striking base above the knee and below the head to be a 'good ball'; two bad balls count one point to the opposite side.\nAdopting the moniker of baseball.\nIn 1892, in “finding there was so much prejudice against the name” the National Rounders Association and the South Wales Rounders Association dropped ‘rounders’ and replaced this with ‘baseball’. This resulted in the governing body, the National Rounders Association, being known as the English Baseball Association and the South Wales Rounders Association becoming the South Wales Baseball Association. In May 1892, it was reported that the Gloucestershire Rounders Association had become the Gloucester English Baseball Association, with leagues already under way.\nDevelopment of the rules.\nIn April 1899, at the annual meeting of the English Baseball Association in Liverpool, it was resolved that the rules of the game would be changed, to speed up play and tackle the “waiting tactics adopted by batsmen”. The change would see batters face two “good balls” instead of three, and that on the third “good ball” the batter would get an “extra” ball.\nBy September 1922 the need for better officiating of games was recognised and the Umpire’s Association was formed. In September 1925 it was reported in the Liverpool Echo that a “revolutionary change in bowling” was being mulled over by the English Baseball Association. The new proposed rule would be “that when the bowler has sent up the third bad ball before he has sent up the second good ball, the batter shall be allowed to go to the first base, and the batting side shall have a bye recorded in their favour. If the first base, at the time, is occupied by another batter, that batter should go to second base. If two or three bases are occupied by batters at the time, each batter shall proceed to his next base, the batter at third base reaching home; but no batter at second or third base shall go to his next base except to make way for the batter occupying the next previous base.”\nFinally, in May 1929, the rules of British baseball were copyrighted by the English Baseball Association.\nRelationship with the Welsh Baseball Union.\nIn a June 1888 edition of the South Wales Daily News, the now codified rules of British baseball were discussed and it was noted that \"the National Rounders Association is the authority\", making clear that the South Wales Baseball Association organised its own domestic leagues and competitions but under the rules created by the English Baseball Association. It was also evidenced that the National Physical Recreation society had supplied a copy of the rules of this new game and that \"the present mode of playing the game is a great improvement on the old style\". At their annual meeting, in 1893, the South Wales Baseball Association \"decided to continue to play under English rules\". In March 1922 the first annual meeting of the newly formed Welsh Baseball Union was held at Grange YMCA, succeeding the South Wales Baseball Association. The new body quickly made a visit to Liverpool and noted that “the closer link formed between the English and Welsh baseball authorities would materially help to attain the standard of a national pastime”. The Athletic News reported, in June 1927, that a British Cup was being considered, between the finalists of the English Baseball Association and Welsh Baseball Union championships.\nEngland versus Wales internationals.\nThe first international match between England and Wales was held on 3 August 1908 at the Harlequins Ground in Roath, Cardiff (St Peter's RFC). Wales won the match 122–118 with batsmen and captain Lew Lewis hitting a number of balls 'over the house tops'. The next international was held in 1914 at Goodison Park, Liverpool. The English won the match in front of 4,000 spectators, but annual internationals would not start until after the war. The first women's international match between England and Wales took place in 1926.\nRelationship with the International Baseball Board.\nIn July 1921 there were efforts for the establishment of a National Baseball Council, where members of the English Baseball Association and South Wales Baseball Association met to discuss the formation of the new governing body. The growth of the international fixture had brought increased scrutiny on the game's arbitration and rules, as such the English Baseball Association and the Welsh Baseball Union formed the International Baseball Board to oversee international fixtures, in 1927.\nOther international fixtures.\nIn August 1918 the English Baseball Association organised an international fixture, whereby England took on Canada at the Police Athletic Ground in the Fairfield area of Liverpool. This game was advertised to have been ‘American baseball’. In June 1933 the Irish Baseball Union sent a team to Liverpool for the first ever international between England and Ireland, at Pirrie Park. The team included players from St. Mary's, St. Oswald's, British and Irish, Hibernians, Independent and Connaught ball clubs. England won by an innings and 42 runs.\nIn October 1934 the English Baseball Association signed an agreement to travel to Edinburgh in 1935, to begin the process of introducing the game into Scotland, though a number of well known Scottish players such as Billy Lamont, Charlie Moore and Donald MacKinlay were already playing in leagues in Liverpool. In the first game, the Scottish defeated the English at Edinburgh by 24 runs to 3, with over 5,000 in attendance. The return game at Bootle attracted a crowd of over 3,000 spectators, to see Scotland triumph again, 4 runs to 0. These two games were played to the American code.\nPrinciple people.\nThe table below represents the currently known chronological order of elected principle people within the English Baseball Association."

        "text": "Jeremy Bates (born August 27, 1976) is an American football coach and former player. He was the quarterbacks coach for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL), a position he assumed in February 2012. Bates has previously served as the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks and quarterbacks coach for the USC Trojans football team.\nPersonal life.\nBates is the son of former long-time collegiate and NFL coach Jim Bates and attended high school in Sevierville, Tennessee. He played quarterback at the University of Tennessee before transferring to Rice University, where he also played baseball. Bates completed his bachelor's degree in 1999 at Rice.\nIn 2014, Bates hiked the 2,900-mile Continental Divide Trail (CDT), completing a five-month trek across the Continental Divide Trail from Mexico to Canada alone, trekking 20–30 miles per day with a 40 to 60 pound backpack.\nCoaching career.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nBates began his coaching career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an offensive quality control coach from 2002 to 2003; the Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002. In 2004, he was promoted to the position of assistant quarterbacks coach, working closely with head coach Jon Gruden and quarterbacks coach John Shoop.\nNew York Jets.\nHe was the New York Jets' quarterbacks coach in 2005; due to a series of injuries the team fielded five different quarterbacks that season, notably Brooks Bollinger.\nDenver Broncos.\nBates joined the Denver Broncos in 2006. In his first season, he served as an offensive assistant, helping offensive coordinator Rick Dennison coach the offensive line. In 2007, he served as wide receivers/quarterbacks coach, and in 2008 as quarterbacks coach, both seasons working closely with quarterback Jay Cutler. In 2008, Bates called the offensive plays for the Broncos, helping Cutler become a Pro Bowl selection and the team to have the NFL's second-most productive offense (1st in the AFC).\nAt the end of the 2008 NFL regular season, longtime head coach Mike Shanahan was fired and replaced by Josh McDaniels. Due to the uncertainty, Bates began looking for a new position.\nUSC Trojans.\nOn January 19, 2009, USC Trojans head coach Pete Carroll hired Bates to replace outgoing coach Carl Smith, who had only taken the quarterbacks job two weeks earlier before moving back to the NFL. Smith had replaced Steve Sarkisian, who had taken the head coaching position of the Washington Huskies after serving as both quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator; John Morton had been promoted to offensive coordinator. Bates called plays from the field while Morton worked from the coaches' booth in the press box, similar to a previous arrangement run by the Trojans during the 2005–2006 seasons between Sarkisian and Lane Kiffin, respectively.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn January 12, 2010, former USC Trojans' head coach Pete Carroll was introduced as the head coach and executive vice-president of the Seattle Seahawks. In 2010 Bates withdrew from consideration for the Bears offensive coordinator job, which eventually went to Mike Martz. It was reported shortly after that Bates would join Carroll's staff as offensive coordinator. Bates was fired on January 18, 2011. A difference in \"philosophy\" was stated as being the reason behind the move.\nChicago Bears.\nBates joined the Chicago Bears on February 7, 2012, as the quarterbacks coach under offensive coordinator Mike Tice, a move which reunited him with quarterback Jay Cutler. On January 17, 2013, Bates was among seven coaches not retained by new head coach Marc Trestman.\nReturn to New York.\nOn February 8, 2017, The New York Jets announced that they were bringing him back in to be their Quarterbacks coach under Head Coach Todd Bowles.\nOn February 14, 2018, the Jets promoted Bates to offensive coordinator. On January 24, 2019, Bates was fired."

        "text": "For the 2010 Winter Olympics, a total of ten sports venues were used, seven in Vancouver (including BC Place), and three in Whistler. The majority of ice sport events were held in Vancouver, while Whistler, which normally serves as a ski resort, hosted the snow events. Six non-competition venues, three each in Vancouver and Whistler, provided athlete housing, space for media, and locations for ceremonies associated with the Games.\nIn its 2002 evaluation of Vancouver's bid during the bidding process for the 2010 Games, the Evaluation Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) highlighted the number and quality of existing competition and training facilities as one of the bid's strengths. Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for use during the Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government.\nAccording to CEO John Furlong, VANOC \"started our venue construction as early as possible\". Construction on Cypress Mountain, the first new competition venue to be completed, began in March 2006 and was completed only eight months later, three years ahead of the start of the Games. By December 2007, all three competition venues at Whistler were completed and open for training and testing. Final construction was completed in February 2009, and sporting events were scheduled at the venues to ensure that they would be adequately tested before hosting the Olympic events. In total, six new competition venues were constructed: Cypress Mountain, Richmond Olympic Oval, UBC Thunderbird Arena, Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre, Whistler Olympic Park, and The Whistler Sliding Centre.\nThe Whistler Sliding Centre was promoted as being one of the fastest sliding tracks in the world, which caused a number of concerns about safety. On February 12, 2010, hours before the opening ceremony, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili suffered a fatal crash during a training run when he was thrown off his sled and collided with a steel pole. He was travelling at the time. His accident came after a series of incidents in the week and reignited concerns about the track's safety. Investigations were conducted the same day, concluding that the accident was not caused by deficiencies in the track. As a preventive measure, an extra of wall was added after the end of Turn 16, and the ice profile was changed.\nCompetition venues.\nThe largest competition venue was Canada Hockey Place, with a capacity of just under 19,000 spectators. For the first time, Olympic games were played on a narrower NHL-sized ice rink, measuring , instead of the international size of . This change saved an expected $10 million (CAD) in construction costs, and allowed more spectators to attend games. This arena, as well as the Pacific Coliseum (the second-largest venue used for the 2010 Olympics), was pre-existing and required minimal renovation in preparation for the Olympics. Of the newly constructed venues for the Games, the Whistler Sliding Centre was the largest, with space for 12,000 spectators to observe the luge, skeleton and bobsled events. Three venues used in the Games were outside Vancouver and Whistler: Cypress Mountain in West Vancouver, the Richmond Olympic Oval in Richmond, and UBC Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Sports Centre on the University Endowment Lands.\nNon-competition venues.\nBecause of the significant distance between Vancouver and Whistler, Olympic Villages and media facilities were constructed in both locations. In addition, while medals ceremonies for the events held in Vancouver took place at the pre-existing BC Place, an additional venue was constructed in Whistler to award medals there. Because BC Place is an indoor stadium, the Olympic torch cauldron, which was lit in the middle of the stadium during the opening ceremony, could not be left there because of safety concerns. A second \"external cauldron\" was erected on the Coal Harbour waterfront, next to the Main Media Centre."

The poorly run league had trouble paying the players and reports existed of player paychecks bouncing.\nA separate league, called Florida Winter League Baseball, featuring overlooked college players or released pro players is scheduled to open in January 2012. It is unclear if the leagues have any connection other than similar names.\nA league by this name resurfaced in 2015 and featured four teams: The Broward Waverunners, the Collier County Loggerheads, the Miami-Dade Red Snappers and the Palm Beach Spoonbills. It is based in Pompano Beach, Florida. \nLeague commissioner Jamie Siragusa had been a player in the independent Empire State League in 1987 and reorganized the FWBL in 2015, following the Empire State League's single complex format.\n2015–2016 season.\nThe season was completed. Miami-Dade Red Snappers\nWon FWBL Championship 2015\n2009–2010 season.\nThe season was incomplete and interrupted after 30 games played"

In 1927, the aircraft was rebuilt as the Type 99A with new wide-span tapered wings, a raised centre section and wide-chord interplane struts. It was powered by an uncowled (525 hp) (392 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI engine.

        "title": "Grand Slam Tennis",
        "text": "Grand Slam Tennis (known as Grand Chelem Tennis in France) is a tennis video game, developed by EA Canada, and released for the Wii in 2009. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were planned to be released Autumn 2009, but they have been \"delayed indefinitely\". Instead, a sequel, \"Grand Slam Tennis 2\", was released exclusively for those consoles in February 2012.\nSome features for the Wii version include online play, Wii MotionPlus functionality, pick up and play, a Grand Slam career mode, and all four Grand Slam locations, including Wimbledon. The Wii version was also the first title in Europe to be bundled with the Wii MotionPlus.\nThe in-game music was created by Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.\nGameplay.\n\"Grand Slam Tennis\" features 23 total players, including 10 retired legends and 13 of today's top players at the time of the game's release. It also includes a \"Create-A-Player\" mode. In the \"Create-A-Player\" mode, players can create their own unique player for use in all modes of the game. The player can customize their created player with branded clothing, racquet styles, accessories and physical appearance. Up to nine players can be created at any one time. Pat Cash serves as the commentator even when he is playing in a match. Grand Slam Tennis offers 12 different authentic stadiums from all four Grand Slam venues to play in, and is the first video game since Top Spin 2 to feature a licensed Wimbledon.\nPlay Now is a mode allows players to enter either a singles or doubles match. This mode is available for both single and multiplayer forms of play. The player is able to select their venue, and to choose settings such as set length, number of sets, difficulty and the option of a tie-break.\nGrand Slam mode allows players to embark on a career with their created player. The career involves travelling to each of the four Grand Slam tournaments and attempt to achieve the Grand Slam by winning every tournament. Each tournament begins with a warm-up match against a fellow fictional rookie of average ability. The player can then challenge a legend or current player to a match in an attempt to learn the players special ability, e.g. Rafael Nadal's forehand topspin, or Björn Borg's fitness. If the player is successful with their challenge, they may equip that special ability for use in future matches. The player can equip only one ability to start with, however as the player increases in skill, they will be able to equip multiple abilities at one time. Then the player will take part in a party style mini-game form of tennis along with fictional players, before starting the tournament. Every tournament starts at the round of 32 stage (round 3).\nParty Mode is a collection of mini-games that are each a slightly altered form of tennis, with slight rule changes:\nOnline multiplayer consists of ranked or unranked matches where you can play anyone around the world. Ranked earns the player points when they beat someone and these points decide what overall ranking you are in the world. Unranked matches are friendly and do not earn any points for the player's online profile. It is good for people who are preparing to hit the leaderboards. When players win ranked matches they do not only win points for themselves but also for their country. There is a national leaderboard which shows which country has the best players.\nReception.\n\"Grand Slam Tennis\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported for release on July 2, 2009, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of one eight, two sixes, and one seven for a total of 27 out of 40.\n\"411Mania\" gave it a score of eight out of ten and said, \"If you are a big fan of the sport, and even engage in the sport in your free time, you will no-doubt enjoy this game. \"Grand Slam\" is a fun way to prepare you for the game's real online draw. If you've just been settling for \"Wii Tennis\" over the past few years, then now is the time to act, because \"Grand Slam Tennis\" is likely as good as it is ever going to get for the sport on the Wii.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" similarly gave it eight out of ten, saying, \"Though ultimately lacking the precision a truly great tennis game needs, EA should be commended for a superb Wii effort which amply demonstrates the publisher's commitment to the format. If not quite the revolution it promised to be, \"Grand Slam Tennis\" shows enough promise that next year's iteration should be a classic.\" \"Teletext GameCentral\" also gave it eight out of ten, saying, \"EA's tennis and Wii MotionPlus debut is a success after all and an encouraging sign for the future.\""

        "text": "The World Series of Poker (WSOP), held annually in Las Vegas, is \"the oldest, largest, most prestigious, and most media-hyped gaming competition in the world\". The WSOP bracelet is considered the most coveted non-monetary prize a poker player can win. Since 1976, a bracelet has been awarded to the winner of every event at the annual WSOP, but titles won before 1976 are still counted as \"bracelets\".\nThe first WSOP was not a freeze out tournament, but rather an event with a set start and stop time and the winner determined by secret ballot. In 1973, a second event, five-card stud, was added. Over the years, most of the major poker variants have been played at least once. In 1977, the first Ladies only event was introduced in the form of $100 buy-in Stud Poker Tournament. Jackie McDaniels won that event to become the first Ladies Champion. She won one of the smallest prizes ($5,580) in WSOP history. By 2007, the popularity of the Ladies Event had grown to the point that it became the first Ladies-only event to have a prize pool greater than $1,000,000. The Ladies played Seven Card Stud for the event's first two decades, but have been playing Texas hold 'em since 2001.\nSince its inception, three players have won multiple Ladies Championships: Barbara Enright, Susie Isaacs, and Nani Dollison. Dollison and Isaacs won the event in consecutive years. Between 1991 and 1997, Isaacs set an event record by qualifying for a cash prize, known as finishing in-the-money, five times. The 1983 Ladies World Poker Championship was the first time that a person \"of color\", Carolyn Gardner, won a WSOP bracelet.\nTraditionally, the Ladies event was the only event held on Mother Day. Due to complaints from mothers, the event was moved to a different day in 2004. Potential conflicts with Mother's Day no longer exist as the WSOP's new owner, Harrah's Casino, moved the event from late spring to the late summer.\nThe WSOP started offering a \"WSOP Academy Ladies Only Poker Camp\" in 2007. This week-long event is held at Caesars Palace and is designed to equip women with the tools to compete at the World Series of Poker. It is held the week leading up to the Ladies Championship. Every year since its inception, a participant from the camp has made it to the final table. In 2007, Ladies Champion Sally Anne Boyer participated in the camp. Patty Till, a 2008 attendee, finished in third place at the 2008 Ladies Championship.\nWSOP Ladies Championship events.\n2005 Ladies Champion Jennifer Tilly was the first non-poker celebrity to win a WSOP bracelet. Tilly had been nominated for an Academy Award for her role in \"Bullets over Broadway\".\nOn 10 June 2008, three events awarded bracelets, including the Ladies event. This was the first time in WSOP history that three people living in the same city, New York, won bracelets on the same day. It was also the first time that a new \"excessive celebration\" penalty was implemented to minimize disruption from exuberant players.\nFrom 2013, the entry fee was officially changed to $10,000 with a $9,000 \"discount\" for ladies. This was done to close a legal loophole used by men to enter the ladies event in several prior years."

Its players include first-class cricketer Steven Croft.\nRaikes Hall.\nBlackpool Cricket Club first formed in 1888 and they regularly played at Raikes Hall pleasure gardens. In 1889, R.G. Barlow organised the All England XI to play at the site against the Blackpool team.\nWhitegate Park.\nDue to repairs being needed at the Raikes Hall site in 1893, the Blackpool Athletic Ground Company decided to give the club a more permanent home at Whitegate Park. The new ground covered an area of 150yds by 130yds.\nThe first recorded match on the ground came in 1893, when Blackpool played the touring Australians, who were on their Ashes tour.\nThe inaugural first-class match to be played on the ground was between the North and the South in the 1905 North v South fixture. Lancashire played their first first-class match on the ground in 1905 when they played against an England XI. From 1905 to the present day, the club's ground has played host to 98 first-class matches, the last of which came in the 2008 County Championship between Lancashire and Surrey.\nIn the early 1920s the whitegate site no longer hosted other sports therefore it was decided the site would be dedicated to the Blackpool Cricket Club.\nStanley Park.\nIn 1925, the grounds were renamed 'Stanley Park' as it sat within the boundary of the new park and continued to be the home of Blackpool Cricket Club. Sir Lindsay Parkinson donated the ground, valued at £10,000 to the club shortly before it was renamed Stanley Park. The ground is managed by Blackpool Cricket Club and the deeds are held in trust by the mayor.\nThe club played in the Ribblesdale League and were part of the founding members whom created the Northern League. Blackpool have also won the National Club Cricket Championship in 1990.\nFormer players.\nMany professionals have played at the club including: Peter Fairclough, Harold Larwood (played in 1939), Jim Parks, Cecil Parkin, Ted McDonald, Stewart Dempster, Ken James, Bill Alley, Hanif Mohammad, Rohan Kanhai, Cammie Smith, Mushtaq Mohammad, Collis King, Maninder Singh, Richie Richardson and Steven Croft.\nArthur Shrewsbury and Johnny Briggs played at the ground in 1891."

The centre is now used by both recreational climbers and for competitions, and is also home to the Scottish National Judo Academy.\nHistory.\nOriginally used for supplying stone to the Central Belt of Scotland due to its proximity to the Union Canal, the quarry expanded from around a third of its present size in 1853 to the current outline in 1895. Edinburgh climbers Rab Anderson, Duncan McCallum and architect David Taylor formed the Ratho Quarry Company, and purchased the quarry in 1995 as the site for the climbing centre. The quarry, which had been unused for around ninety years, was filled with compacted rubble and heavily overgrown with trees and shrubs, making assessment of the site difficult until significant work had been carried out, but the assumption that the floor of the quarry was flat proved to be correct.

As well as a trio of boulders in the centre of the main hall, there is a dedicated bouldering room, with routes ranging in difficulty from V0 to V15.\nThe only official world record International Federation of Sport Climbing speed climbing walls has two identical speed routes allow speed climbing competitions to be conducted head to head, and there is an articulated competition wall known as \"The Hanger\" that can be raised or lowered to change the angle of overhang.\nThe larger \"lobe\" of the quarry is also used for outdoor climbing, although some of the rock is described as \"loose and scary\". Formed from dolerite, there are around 65 known routes, including many central belt classics such as Shear Fear (E2 5b) and Wally I (E2 5C).\nThere is a cafe overlooking the main arena as well as smaller cafe on the ground floor. The centre has a fully equipped gym.

        "text": "The 2009 Super League Grand Final was the 12th official Grand Final and conclusive and championship-deciding match of the Super League XIV season. It was held on Saturday 10 October 2009, at Old Trafford, Manchester, and was contested by defending champions and 2009 League Leaders Leeds Rhinos, and the team they had faced in the grand final for the past two years, St. Helens.\nThe 2009 decider, contested by the sides finishing 1st and 2nd in the competition, was a very close contest, played at a furious pace from end to end with the lead changing several times and rarely being more than a single point. Every ruling on try-scoring situations was given by the video referee, with some allowed and some disallowed, including a few very close and controversial calls. Leeds Rhinos were eventual victors, winning the match 18 to 10. They became the first side in Super League history to be champions in three successive years.\nMatch details.\nIt was the third consecutive year that these two teams faced each other in the Super League Grand Final. Both sides were at full strength.\nPre-match entertainment was provided by The Wombats, an indie rock band from Liverpool. The band performed songs from their album, \"\". All Angels, a classical and pop group, performed, with Yorkshire Co-op Brass Band, the Grand Final anthem, Jerusalem.\nFirst Half.\nSt Helens kicked off and after thirteen minutes of end-to-end football they were thirty metres out from Leeds' goal-line when Jon Wilkin chip-kicked the ball ahead for Kyle Eastmond to regather, crossing the line then running back infield to improve the field position for the kick before grounding it. Video referee Phil Bentham only gave the four points after checking that there was no knock-on in the regather and Grand Final débutante Eastmond converted his own try to give the Saints a 6 nil lead. In the twenty-sixth minute, St. Helens were again down in Leeds' half when Sean Long put up a bomb and as the ball came down the Rhinos defence was ruled to have interfered with the attacking Saints players, drawing a penalty. The decision to take the two points was made and the goal was kicked by Eastmond, pushing St. Helens' lead out to 8 nil. A few minutes later Leeds had managed to get to the other end of the field and were on the attack when Matt Diskin dived over the line from dummy half, reaching out through the defenders to put the ball down. The video referee was again called on to make the ruling and gave the try. Kevin Sinfield's conversion attempt hit the upright so the score was 8 - 4 in favour of St. Helens with less than ten minutes of the first half remaining. In the thirty-seventh minute the Rhinos were again in an attacking position when Danny McGuire got the ball out to the right and chipped it ahead in goal where the St. Helens defence failed to secure it and Lee Smith came through to touch it down. Sinfield again missed the conversion so the scores remained level at 8 all and did not change before the half-time siren.\n2nd half.\nLeeds kicked off and the ball went over the line after touching the arm of St. Helens' winger Ade Gardner. This gave a scrum feed to the Rhinos in an attacking position and when Sinfield got the ball close to the uprights he kicked a drop goal, putting Leeds in front for the first time in the match at 9 - 8. Just on forty-five minutes St. Helens centre Matt Gidley made a break and sent his winger Ade Gardner racing down the sideline to try to score in the corner. But after video analysis it was shown that the Leeds defenders coming across had forced him into touch before he grounded the ball. In the 58th minute St. Helens were again down at Leeds' end of the field when they got a penalty for a high shot on Sean Long from Rob Burrow. Saints opted to take the two points and Kyle Eastmond performed his third successful kick in a row, giving his side a one-point lead at 10-9. About seven minutes later Leeds were right down on St. Helens' goal line when Keiron Cunningham, in an attempt to slow things down, knocked the ball out of a Rhinos player's arms as he got up to play it, giving away a penalty. Sinfield's kick from right in front was never going to miss, so the one-point lead was with Leeds once again at 11-10, now with just over fifteen minutes remaining. At the sixty-eight-minute mark, St. Helens were on the attack and moved the ball out to Eastmond's wing where he dived over in the corner. Again the video referee was called on to check whether the St. Helens winger was taken into touch before scoring and he was, a desperate tackle by Sinfield pushing Eastmond's body into the corner post. Back at the other end of the field, Saints' goal-line defence was forced to absorb mounting pressure as Leeds attacked repeatedly, eventually penetrating when a chip kick from McGuire on the last tackle was chased and picked up by Lee Smith who touched down in the seventy-third minute. Once more the video referee's decision was requested, this time to check whether the scorer was on-side. Despite Smith appearing to be slightly in front of McGuire when the ball left his boot, the benefit of the doubt was given and the try was awarded. \nThe extras were kicked from straight in front by Sinfield, so the score was 17-10 in favour of Leeds with under seven minutes of play remaining. Just on the seventy-eight-minute mark the ball went to Rob Burrow for a drop goal attempt which he kicked successfully, putting the score at 18-10, which it would remain until the full-time siren.\nIt was the Rhinos' two-try hero, Lee Smith's final game for Leeds before moving to rugby union. Leeds' forward Kevin Sinfield was awarded the Harry Sunderland Trophy as man-of-the-match.\nThe following day over 8,000 fans were at Headingley Carnegie Stadium to celebrate the victorious Leeds players' homecoming.\nTelecast details.\nThe Grand Final was shown in 30 countries worldwide with a potential audience of over 100 million people. In addition to a live broadcast in the United Kingdom by primary broadcast partner Sky Sports, the game was also shown live in the United States, the Middle East, Russia, Romania, Poland and New Zealand. France, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Spain saw the match in a delayed telecast. BBC Sport showed an hour-long programme of extended highlights.\n2010 World Club Challenge.\nHaving won the grand final, the Leeds Rhinos had earned the right to play against the 2009 NRL grand final-winners, the Melbourne Storm in the 2010 World Club Challenge."

        "title": "John Mitchell (American football coach)",
        "text": "John Mitchell Jr. (born October 14, 1951) is a former American football coach and collegiate player. Over the course of his career, Mitchell has broken several racial barriers, one of which was being the first black player for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He served on the staff of the Pittsburgh Steelers from until his retirement following the season.\nAs a player, Mitchell was the first African-American to play football for the storied Alabama Crimson Tide. In his second year with the program he became the first African-American co-captain at the school. The next year, he became the team's first black assistant coach and also the youngest coach to have ever been hired at Alabama. Later he would break another barrier by becoming the first black defensive coordinator in the Southeastern Conference.\nHis coaching career spanned 50 years during which time he worked with several icons of the football coaching pantheon, including college coaching greats Bear Bryant and Lou Holtz as well as Bill Belichick, Bill Cowher, and Mike Tomlin in the pros. Teams he has coached have won championships at both the college and professional levels.\nEarly life.\nMitchell was born in Mobile, Alabama, on October 14, 1951; the third of five children of Helen and John Mitchell, Sr. His father worked as a civil engineer for the United States Coast Guard.\nAt Williamson High School in Mobile, which was an all-black school, Mitchell played football and basketball. As a senior, he played on the offensive line. Though standing , he weighed just , which major colleges considered too light for the position. His lack of size explains why he was not offered a football scholarship out of high school by any major colleges in his home state. He did, however, field football scholarship offers from historically black powerhouses like Grambling State University and Tennessee State University.\nSports were not everything for Mitchell; he finished third in the nation in a science fair with a group of classmates. All five members of the science fair team were offered academic scholarships by the University of Alabama and Auburn University. Although these were the two schools Mitchell had dreamed of playing football for, neither was recruiting black football players at the time, and Mitchell very much wanted to play \"big-time college football\".\nMitchell determined that his best chance of eventually playing Division I football was by going the junior college route. He accepted a football scholarship from Eastern Arizona Junior College in Thatcher, Arizona.\nPlaying career.\nMitchell played on both the offensive and defensive lines at Eastern Arizona. He was named a Junior College All-American in each of his two years in the program. More significantly, he added of muscle to his frame in the school's weight training program, which was an amenity his high school lacked. Even with the added bulk, he showed no appreciable loss of speed. He also earned an associate's degree in social work from Eastern Arizona.\nBased on his junior college performance and increased bulk, Mitchell was recruited by several major college programs, but he originally committed to John McKay at the University of Southern California. While on the golf course with University of Alabama coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, McKay casually mentioned that he had received a commitment from an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant would not be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, as well as the amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was an easy route was a big factor in his decision.\nIn 1971 Mitchell, along with Wilbur Jackson, became the first African-American to play football for the Crimson Tide. He started all 24 games in his two seasons at Alabama, during which time the team compiled a 21–3 record and won two Southeastern Conference championships. In 1972, Mitchell became the first African-American to be named a co-captain at Alabama. The same year he was named an All-American by the American Football Coaches Association. He was selected to the All-SEC team in each of his two seasons at Alabama. Mitchell earned a B.S. in social welfare, completing his degree requirements a semester early.\nThe San Francisco 49ers selected Mitchell in the seventh round of the 1973 NFL Draft. Although he played primarily defensive end in college, he was once again considered undersized to fill that role in the pro game; the 49ers wanted to make him a linebacker. He signed a contract with the 49ers and attended training camp, but after being slowed in camp by an illness he was cut by the team prior to the season.\nUpon being cut by the 49ers, Mitchell chose to close the book on this playing career even though he may have been able to pursue an opportunity in the fledgling World Football League, saying, \"I had a chance, whatever happened, good or bad, and I figured a guy's got to work someday.\"\nCoaching career.\nAlabama.\nMitchell decided to return to Alabama to attend law school in the fall of 1973. When he asked coach Bryant for help in finding a campus job to make ends meet while he worked on his graduate degree, Bryant instead offered him a full-time coaching position. In giving up his law school plans to accept the offer to coach defensive ends, Mitchell became the first African-American assistant coach for the Crimson Tide. He was also the youngest coach to have been hired by the school. In addition to coaching, he was instrumental in the recruiting of top African-American players to play football at Alabama. One player whom Mitchell helped recruit was Ozzie Newsome, who went on to have a Hall of Fame career.\nIn Mitchell's first year of coaching at Alabama, the team compiled an 11–1 record and won the national championship in addition to the SEC championship. Over each of the next two seasons, they matched that 11–1 record, added two more SEC titles and finished inside the top-five in the polls. In 1976, which would be Mitchell's last with the team, they fell off a bit with a 9–3 record, but they still remained in the top-fifteen nationwide. Mitchell helped develop Leroy Cook who was a two-time All-America selection drafted in the 10th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys and selected as one of two defensive ends on the All-time Alabama team named by Sports Illustrated in 2006.\nArkansas.\nIn early 1977, Mitchell accepted a position coaching defensive ends at the University of Arkansas under Lou Holtz, after deciding the move was \"at least horizontal\". Following his first season with the Razorbacks in which the team went 11–1 and beat second-ranked Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, Holtz gushed,\nIn the course of the six years Mitchell would spend at Arkansas, the team compiled a record of 54–16–2, won a Southwest Conference championship, played in a bowl game each year and failed to finish in the top-20 in the polls only once. Among the defensive linemen who came through the Arkansas program during Mitchell's tenure were future Pro Football Hall of Fame member Dan Hampton and Ron Faurot an All-American who was drafted in the second round and played two seasons in the NFL. During his time in Arkansas, Mitchell regularly participated in pick-up basketball games with Bill Clinton, who was at the time a law professor at the school.\nUSFL.\nMitchell left Arkansas in 1983 to pursue an opportunity to coach at the professional level in his home state with the Birmingham Stallions of the newly created United States Football League (USFL). He coached linebackers for the Stallions for the team's (and league's) entire three-year existence. In 1985, outside linebacker Herb Spencer made the All-League team. When the team quit paying its coaches on New Year's Day in 1986, Mitchell returned to the college ranks, taking at a job at Temple University.\nTemple.\nAt Temple Mitchell coached defensive tackles and defensive ends under head coach Bruce Arians, with whom he would later work on the Steelers coaching staff. Arians called Mitchell \"a super football coach and a great person\", adding \"I think we had more quarterback sacks this year in our third game than we had all last year.\" At Temple, Mitchell coached Ralph Jarvis whom the Chicago Bears chose in the third round of the 1988 NFL Draft.\nLouisiana State.\nAfter a single season at Temple, Mitchell returned to the SEC in 1987 at Louisiana State University (LSU) where he served as outside linebackers coach under Mike Archer. After two seasons coaching linebackers Mitchell was promoted to defensive coordinator in early 1990 succeeding Pete Jenkins and becoming the first African-American to serve in that capacity in the SEC.\nMitchell resigned his position at LSU in March 1990 due to improper accounting of some hotel expenses over the previous two years. He was reinstated two months later following an investigation and repayment of the disputed funds.\nWith Mitchell leading the defense, the Tigers finished a disappointing 5–6 in 1990 (including 2–5 in the SEC) leading to the firing of head coach Archer following the season. Mitchell was offered a chance to return to his post coaching outside linebackers by Archer's replacement, Curley Hallman, with whom Mitchell had coached at Alabama. However, Mitchell chose to leave LSU a couple of months later to return to the professional ranks.\nNFL.\nCleveland Browns.\nAfter leaving LSU, Mitchell was hired as defensive line coach of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) in 1991. He coached for the Browns under head coach Bill Belichick for three seasons, helping to develop Michael Dean Perry (who twice made the Pro Bowl in Mitchell's three seasons with the team) and Rob Burnett (who made his only Pro Bowl in Mitchell's final year with the club).\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nIn 1994, he moved on to become the defensive line coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers under Bill Cowher, replacing Steve Furness. He's been with the Steelers ever since, making him the club's longest tenured coach, and one of the longest serving coaches with his current team in the NFL. With the arrival of Mike Tomlin in 2007, Mitchell replaced Russ Grimm as the team's assistant head coach while retaining his responsibilities in coaching the defensive line.\nThe Steelers led the league in stopping the run four times in the first fifteen years of Mitchell's tenure (through 2008). Steelers defensive linemen have participated in the Pro Bowl eight times since Mitchell's arrival: Casey Hampton (five Pro Bowls), Aaron Smith (once), Brett Keisel (once) and Joel Steed (once). The team as a whole has also had tremendous success during Mitchell's tenure, making the playoff eleven times and reaching the AFC Championship Game eight times in his first 18 years. They've also made it to four Super Bowls, winning the championship in 2005 and again in 2008.\nIn Super Bowl XL in February 2006, the Steelers faced a tough test in slowing Seattle Seahawks All-Pro running back Shaun Alexander who ran for 1,880 yards and scored an NFL record 28 touchdowns in the regular season behind an offensive line that featured All-Pro linemen Walter Jones and Steve Hutchinson on the left side. The defensive line would need to slow down the Seahawks running attack to keep the Steelers in the game, a challenge which Mitchell took personally. The players came through holding Alexander under the 100-yard plateau and most importantly preventing him from scoring, which was crucial to a Steelers win. After the game, Mitchell said of the strategy, \"Our thing was 'keep him out of the end zone.' We didn't care if he got 300 yards; don't let him in the end zone.\"\nIn Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, they again faced a formidable offense in the Arizona Cardinals. The defensive line once again came through with a great performance, holding the Cardinals to just 33 yards on the ground.\nMitchell coaches in a quiet and cerebral style which he picked up from the first head coach under who he worked, saying with typical understatement, \"Coach Bryant wasn't a screamer, and I noticed he had some success.\" He has further described his approach to coaching thusly:\nThis style and the results it has brought have earned Mitchell the respect of his peers in the NFL. Clarence Brooks coaches defensive linemen for the Steeler division rival the Baltimore Ravens and thus meets the Steelers at least twice a year. Brooks assessed his counterpart saying,\nMitchell is held in extremely high regard by his fellow Steelers coaches as well. Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau has said he's \"always had great confidence in him\". Head coach Mike Tomlin has called Mitchell a \"trailblazer\" and described him as \"a very respected coach in this league and well respected in this organization\".\nMitchell retired from coaching following the 2022 season, after 28 years with the Steelers.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell lives with his wife, Joyce, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the couple have no children. Mitchell had expressed interest in becoming the head football coach at Alabama when that position had been open in the past. However, despite this interest and his connection with the program he has never been pursued for the position.\nAway from football, Mitchell's avocations include collecting art, fine wine and vintage jazz as well as studying history. He has stated that he plans to retire around 2012 to 2013, at which time he will return to Birmingham, Alabama. He was elected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame with the class of 2009. Mitchell said of his selection: \"I'm from the state of Alabama, and this is big. The state of Alabama is putting me, John Mitchell, a black kid from Mobile, in their sports hall of fame. There's nothing bigger in my life.\""

        "text": "Rugby union in Madagascar is the most popular team sport in the nation. As of August 2023, Madagascar is ranked 45th worldwide by World Rugby (WR), and boasts over 42,540 registered players and more than 410 rugby clubs. Although Madagascar lacks a professional competition, as it is one of the poorest countries in the world, it does possess a national club competition that is extensively covered in the national print media, as well as having matches televised. \nRugby is considered the national sport of Madagascar.\nThe governing body is the Madagascan Rugby Federation or Fédération Malagasy de Rugby.\nHistory.\nRugby union was introduced to Madagascar in the 1890s by French railroad workers who played the game in the capital, Antananarivo, during the colonial period. Historically the sport was seen as a violent pastime of the poor, however recent developments have seen a huge increase in the sport's profile throughout the country. The Madagascar team, locally referred to as the Makis (a Malagasy word for the ring-tailed lemur), reached the finals of the 2005 Africa Cup, increasing nationwide interest in the sport. Since then they have been semi-finalists in the 2006 Africa Cup and finalists again in the 2007 Africa Cup.\nMadagascar is a founder member of the Confederation of African Rugby (CAR), which was launched officially in January 1986, in Tunis, Tunisia. Rugby officials from Tunisia, Morocco, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Kenya, and the Seychelles also attended.\nCompetitions.\nThe national club competition is structured along the same lines as the Argentine club championship. The regional unions within Madagascar send their top club(s) from the previous year's championship to compete in the nationwide top-flight league called the Top 8.\nThe national team also competes annually in the Africa Cup, where matches sometimes double as Confederation of African Rugby Rugby World Cup qualifiers.\nPopularity.\nIn addition to large participant numbers, rugby is popular with spectators in Madagascar. The Top 8 has average attendance figures of over 10,000, whilst the league final, and most international fixtures, attract crowds upward of 40,000 at the Stade Municipal de Mahamasina in the capital. It is common that international rugby matches substantially outdraw those of football at the Mahamasina. Rugby's popularity is strongest in the central highlands region including Antananarivo.\nRugby union's popularity in the country was recently demonstrated during the Division 1B Final of the Africa Cup, held in Madagascar. Madagascar triumphed over Namibia in front of 40,000 fans to stay in the qualification process for the 2015 Rugby World Cup to be held in the United Kingdom.\nIn Madagascar, rugby is a very popular sport among women. It is estimated that 60% of players in the country are women. The girls from Sapphire Coast and their captain Marcelia, backed by the French NGO Terres en Mêlées are emerging as models for the development of women rugby in poor areas outside the capital city. They actually won twice the national girls championship. \nRugby is thus becoming a real tool to fight against poverty and develop gender equality in the country. Marcelia has been nominated one of the five most influential women of the country in 2019 by promoting development through rugby in Madagascar and in France."

Montreal lead 17–2 in previous playoff series meetings. This was a rematch of last year's Adams Division Semifinals, in which Montreal won in a three-game sweep.\nIn the series finale, the Canadiens got the only goal when Mats Naslund scored with just 51 seconds remaining in regulation. Steve Penney stopped all 20 shots to register the shutout.\n(A2) Quebec Nordiques vs. (A3) Buffalo Sabres.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. This was a rematch of last year's Adams Division Semifinals, in which Quebec won in a three-game sweep.\nIn the final game, Buffalo led 5–3 with just nine minutes remaining but allowed the Nordiques to score two goals in a span of 64 seconds to tie it at 12:06.

New York won three of the previous five meetings. Their last meeting was won by New York in a three-game sweep in the 1983 Patrick Division Semifinals.\n(P2) Washington Capitals vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. New York won both previous series over the past two seasons, including last year's Patrick Division Finals in five games.\nThe series comeback by the Islanders is the only instance in NHL history a team has overcome a 2–0 series deficit to win a best-of-five series.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N1) St. Louis Blues vs. (N4) Minnesota North Stars.\nThis was the sixth playoff series meeting between these two teams.

Both teams split their prior two meetings. This was a rematch of last year's Adams Division Finals in which Montreal won in six games.\nThe Quebec Nordiques and Montreal Canadiens battled in a seven-game series. Bitter rivals from the province of Quebec, the Nords shocked the Habs in 1982, only to see a fourth-place Montreal club upset Quebec two years later. In the deciding seventh game at the Montreal Forum, Peter Stastny scored the game and series winning goal, giving Quebec an improbable 3–2 overtime win and berth in the Wales Conference Finals. The franchise did not get to the conference finals again until 1996, their first year as the Colorado Avalanche, in which they won the Stanley Cup.\n(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (P3) New York Islanders.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Both teams split their previous two meetings. New York won the most recent meeting in six games in the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Philadelphia Flyers ended the New York Islanders' string of five straight seasons in the Stanley Cup Finals by dispatching the club four games to one. Flyers goaltender Pelle Lindbergh registered a pair of shutouts, one in the first game and the other in the clinching fifth game, by a 1–0 score.\nClarence Campbell Conference.\n(N2) Chicago Black Hawks vs. (N4) Minnesota North Stars.\nThis was the fourth playoff series meeting between these two teams. Chicago won two of the previous three meetings over the past three seasons. Minnesota won last season's Norris Division Semifinals 3–2.\nThe Chicago Black Hawks simply outscored the Minnesota North Stars in an offensive-minded six-game series that featured 62 total goals.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (S2) Winnipeg Jets.\nThis was the third playoff series meeting between these two teams. Edmonton won the previous two meetings over the past two seasons, including last year's Smythe Division Semifinals in a three-game sweep.\nDefending Cup champion Edmonton was too much for the Winnipeg Jets, sweeping them in four straight games and doubling their goal total.\nConference finals.\nPrince of Wales Conference final.\n(P1) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (A2) Quebec Nordiques.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Philadelphia won the only previous meeting 3–2 in the 1981 Preliminary round.\nAlthough the Flyers held the best record in the NHL with 53 wins and 113 points, the Adams Division held a better record against the Patrick Division, so the Wales finals began in Quebec City. Philadelphia and Quebec split the first four games of the series, then the Flyers edged the Nordiques, 2–1 in game five. Game six in Philadelphia was a tour-de-force for the Flyers, outshooting Quebec 36–15, and winning 3–0. Flyers captain Dave Poulin's five-on-three shorthanded goal early in the second period sealed the win and returned to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1980. The win came at a high cost for the Flyers as both 54-goal forward Tim Kerr and defenceman Brad McCrimmon were lost for the remainder of the playoffs with injuries.\nClarence Campbell Conference final.\n(S1) Edmonton Oilers vs. (N2) Chicago Black Hawks.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting between these two teams. Edmonton won the only previous meeting in a four-game sweep in the 1983 Clarence Campbell Conference Final.\nThe Oilers defeated the Black Hawks in six games, with the home team winning the first five games. This was a six-game series that broke all sorts of records for total offense. Edmonton won the first two games at home by 11–2 and 7–3 scores, only to see Chicago strike back at home with 5–2 and 8–6 victories. However, Edmonton rebounded to blast the Hawks in the final two games, 10–5 and 8–2 to earn their third trip to the Cup Finals in as many years. Edmonton set all-time playoff marks with the most goals in one series, and most goals in a six-game series, and both clubs set records with the most total goals in a semifinal series and the most total goals in one six-game series. Oilers' Jari Kurri scored three hat tricks in the series, setting a still-standing NHL record.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the second playoff series between these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 1980 Preliminary round, which Philadelphia won in a three-game sweep. Philadelphia made their fifth Finals appearance. They last appeared in the Finals in 1980, which Philadelphia lost against the New York Islanders in six games. This was Edmonton's third consecutive and third overall Finals appearance. They won the previous year's Finals against the New York Islanders in five games. Philadelphia won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.

        "title": "Jerusalem cricket",
        "text": "Jerusalem crickets (or potato bugs) are a group of large, flightless insects in the genera \"Ammopelmatus\" and \"Stenopelmatus\", together comprising the tribe Stenopelmatini. The former genus is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, while the latter genus is from Central America.\nDespite their common names, these insects are neither true crickets (which belong to the family Gryllidae) nor true bugs (which belong to the order Hemiptera), nor are they native to Jerusalem. These nocturnal insects use their strong mandibles to feed primarily on dead organic matter but can also eat other insects. Their highly adapted feet are used for burrowing beneath moist soil to feed on decaying root plants and tubers.\nWhile Jerusalem crickets are not venomous, they can emit a foul smell and are capable of inflicting a painful bite.\nClassification.\nThere are 19 species recognized as valid in the genus \"Stenopelmatus\", as presently delimited (with 13 more of uncertain status and potentially not valid), though the genus was formerly much larger, including most of the species now placed in the genus \"Ammopelmatus\", which contains 20 additional species. The family Stenopelmatidae and subfamily Stenopelmatinae contain several Old World genera, but only the genera in the tribe Stenopelmatini (all New World) are referred to as Jerusalem crickets. Other families in the same superfamily (Stenopelmatoidea) in Australia and New Zealand include the wētā and king crickets. They are similar to stenopelmatines in many respects.\nCommunication.\nSimilar to true crickets, each species of Jerusalem cricket produces a different song during mating. This song takes the form of a characteristic drumming in which the insect beats its abdomen against the ground.\nNo species have wings with sound-producing structures; moreover, evidently none has structures it could use to hear sound. This contrasts with true crickets and katydids, who use their wings to produce sounds and have hearing organs to sense sounds of others. Jerusalem crickets seem unable to hiss by forcing air through their spiracles, as some beetles and cockroaches do. Instead, the few Jerusalem crickets that do make sound rub their hind legs against the sides of the abdomen, producing a rasping, hissing noise. This hiss may serve to deter predators rather than to communicate with other crickets. For such purposes, Jerusalem crickets rely on substrate vibrations felt by subgenual organs located in all six of the insect's legs.\nNames.\nSeveral hypotheses attempt to explain the origin of the term \"Jerusalem cricket\". One suggests the term originated from a mixing of Navajo and Christian terminology, resulting from the strong connection Franciscan priests had with the Navajos in developing their dictionary and vocabulary. Such priests may have heard the Navajos speak of a \"skull insect\" and took this as a reference to Calvary (also known as \"Skull Hill\") outside Jerusalem near the place where Jesus was crucified.\nSeveral Navajo names refer to the insect's head:\nOther names include the Hopi (\"shiny bug\"), the Spanish (\"child of the earth\") and (\"child's face\")."

        "title": "Cricket (insect)",
        "text": "Crickets are orthopteran insects which are related to bush crickets, and, more distantly, to grasshoppers. In older literature, such as Imms, \"crickets\" were placed at the family level (\"i.e.\" Gryllidae), but contemporary authorities including Otte now place them in the superfamily Grylloidea. The word has been used in combination to describe more distantly related taxa in the suborder Ensifera, such as king crickets and mole crickets.\nCrickets have mainly cylindrically shaped bodies, round heads, and long antennae. Behind the head is a smooth, robust pronotum. The abdomen ends in a pair of long cerci; females have a long, cylindrical ovipositor. Diagnostic features include legs with 3-segmented tarsi; as with many Orthoptera, the hind legs have enlarged femora, providing power for jumping. The front wings are adapted as tough, leathery elytra, and some crickets chirp by rubbing parts of these together. The hind wings are membranous and folded when not in use for flight; many species, however, are flightless. The largest members of the family are the bull crickets, \"Brachytrupes\", which are up to long.\nCrickets are distributed all around the world except at latitudes 55° or higher, with the greatest diversity being in the tropics. They occur in varied habitats from grassland, bushes, and forests to marshes, beaches, and caves. Crickets are mainly nocturnal, and are best known for the loud, persistent, chirping song of males trying to attract females, although some species are mute. The singing species have good hearing, via the tympana on the tibiae of the front legs.\nCrickets often appear as characters in literature. The Talking Cricket features in Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", and in films based on the book. The insect is central to Charles Dickens's 1845 \"The Cricket on the Hearth\" and George Selden's 1960 \"The Cricket in Times Square\". Crickets are celebrated in poems by William Wordsworth, John Keats, Du Fu and Vladimir Nazor. They are kept as pets in countries from China to Europe, sometimes for cricket fighting. Crickets are efficient at converting their food into body mass, making them a candidate for food production. They are used as human food in Southeast Asia, where they are sold deep-fried in markets as snacks. They are also used to feed carnivorous pets and zoo animals. In Brazilian folklore, crickets feature as omens of various events.\nDescription.\nCrickets are small to medium-sized insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind these are two large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal nor lateral keels (ridges).\nAt the tip of the abdomen is a pair of long cerci (paired appendages on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.\nThe wings lie flat on the body and are very variable in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft parts of the body and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.\nThe largest members of the family are the -long bull crickets (\"Brachytrupes\") which excavate burrows a metre or more deep. The tree crickets (Oecanthinae) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent fore wings, while the field crickets (Gryllinae) are robust brown or black insects.\nDistribution and habitat.\nCrickets have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in all parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.\nCrickets are found in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies are found in the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, excavating shallow or deep burrows. Some make home in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of water.\nBiology.\nDefence.\nCrickets are relatively defenceless, soft-bodied insects. Most species are nocturnal and spend the day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter, or in the cracks in the ground that develop in dry weather. Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence. Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs. Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it with the head.\nOther defensive strategies are the use of camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that make it difficult for predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place. While some crickets have a weak bite, a member of the Gryllacrididae or raspy crickets from Australia were found to have the strongest bite of any insect.\nChirping.\nMost male crickets make a loud chirping sound by stridulation (scraping two specially textured body parts together). The stridulatory organ is located on the tegmen, or fore wing, which is leathery in texture. A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like serrations on its edge forming a file-like structure, and at the rear edge of the tegmen is a scraper. The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other. The central part of the tegmen contains the \"harp\", an area of thick, sclerotized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound, as does the pocket of air between the tegmina and the body wall. Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, so make no sound.\nSeveral types of cricket songs are in the repertoire of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced for a brief period after a successful mating and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.\nCrickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature of their environment. Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the temperature is (about 62 chirps a minute at in one common species; each species has its own rate). The relationship between temperature and the rate of chirping is known as Dolbear's law. According to this law, counting the number of chirps produced in 14 seconds by the snowy tree cricket, common in the United States, and adding 40 will approximate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\nIn 1975, Dr. William H. Cade discovered that the parasitic tachinid fly \"Ormia ochracea\" is attracted to the song of the cricket, and uses it to locate the male to deposit her larvae on him. It was the first known example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal. Since then, many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly, or related species. In response to this selective pressure, a mutation leaving males unable to chirp was observed amongst a population of \"Teleogryllus oceanicus\" on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, enabling these crickets to elude their parasitoid predators. A different mutation with the same effect was also discovered on the neighboring island of Oahu (ca. away). Recently, new \"purring\" males of the same species in Hawaii are able to produce a novel auditory sexual signal that can be used to attract females while greatly reducing the likelihood of parasitoid attack from the fly.\nFlight.\nSome species, such as the ground crickets (Nemobiinae), are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (\"Copholandrevus\"), others lack hind wings and have shortened fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore wings. In \"Teleogryllus\", the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%. Probably, most species with hind wings longer than fore wings engage in flight.\nSome species, such as \"Gryllus assimilis\", take off, fly, and land efficiently and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind wings are shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, they may be pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.\n\"Gryllus firmus\" exhibits wing polymorphism; some individuals have fully functional, long hind wings and others have short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.\nDiet.\nCaptive crickets are omnivorous; when deprived of their natural diet, they accept a wide range of organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers and consume various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully raised on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.\nCrickets have relatively powerful jaws, and several species have been known to bite humans.\nReproduction and lifecycle.\nMale crickets establish their dominance over each other by aggression. They start by lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, at the same time each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.\nFemales are generally attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur during which the character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.\nMost crickets lay their eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, needle-like or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into the wall of a burrow. The short-tailed cricket (\"Anurogryllus\") excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.\nCrickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose lifecycle consists of an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph about the size of a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.\nInbreeding avoidance.\nSome species of cricket are polyandrous. In \"Gryllus bimaculatus\", the females select and mate with multiple viable sperm donors, preferring novel mates. Female \"Teleogryllus oceanicus\" crickets from natural populations similarly mate and store sperm from multiple males. Female crickets exert a postcopulatory fertilization bias in favour of unrelated males to avoid the genetic consequences of inbreeding. Fertilization bias depends on the control of sperm transport to the sperm storage organs. The inhibition of sperm storage by female crickets can act as a form of cryptic female choice to avoid the severe negative effects of inbreeding. Controlled-breeding experiments with the cricket \"Gryllus firmus\" demonstrated inbreeding depression, as nymphal weight and early fecundity declined substantially over the generations; this was caused as expected by an increased frequency of homozygous combinations of deleterious recessive alleles.\nPredators, parasites, and pathogens.\nCrickets have many natural enemies and are subject to various pathogens and parasites. They are eaten by large numbers of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their hard parts are often found during the examination of animal intestines. Mediterranean house geckos (\"Hemidactylus turcicus\") have learned that although a calling decorated cricket (\"Gryllodes supplicans\") may be safely positioned in an out-of-reach burrow, female crickets attracted to the call can be intercepted and eaten.\nThe entomopathogenic fungus \"Metarhizium anisopliae\" attacks and kills crickets and has been used as the basis of control in pest populations. The insects are also affected by the cricket paralysis virus, which has caused high levels of fatalities in cricket-rearing facilities. Other fatal diseases that have been identified in mass-rearing establishments include \"Rickettsia\" and three further viruses. The diseases may spread more rapidly if the crickets become cannibalistic and eat the corpses.\nRed parasitic mites sometimes attach themselves to the dorsal region of crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm \"Paragordius varius\" is an internal parasite and can control the behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly \"Sarcophaga kellyi\" develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of \"Rhopalosoma\" lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.\nThe fly \"Ormia ochracea\" has very acute hearing and targets calling male crickets. It locates its prey by ear and then lays its eggs nearby. The developing larvae burrow inside any crickets with which they come in contact and in the course of a week or so, devour what remains of the host before pupating. In Florida, the parasitic flies were only present in the autumn, and at that time of year, the males sang less but for longer periods. A trade-off exists for the male between attracting females and being parasitized.\nPhylogeny and taxonomy.\nThe phylogenetic relationships of the Gryllidae, summarized by Darryl Gwynne in 1995 from his own work (using mainly anatomical characteristics) and that of earlier authors, are shown in the following cladogram, with the Orthoptera divided into two main groups, Ensifera (crickets \"sensu lato\") and Caelifera (grasshoppers). Fossil Ensifera are found from the late Carboniferous period (300 Mya) onwards, and the true crickets, Gryllidae, from the Triassic period (250 to 200 Mya).\nCladogram after Gwynne, 1995:\nA phylogenetic study by Jost &amp; Shaw in 2006 using sequences from 18S, 28S, and 16S rRNA supported the monophyly of Ensifera. Most ensiferan families were also found to be monophyletic, and the superfamily Gryllacridoidea was found to include Stenopelmatidae, Anostostomatidae, Gryllacrididae and Lezina. Schizodactylidae and Grylloidea were shown to be sister taxa, and Rhaphidophoridae and Tettigoniidae were found to be more closely related to Grylloidea than had previously been thought. The authors stated that \"a high degree of conflict exists between the molecular and morphological data, possibly indicating that much homoplasy is present in Ensifera, particularly in acoustic structures.\" They considered that tegmen stridulation and tibial tympanae are ancestral to Ensifera and have been lost on multiple occasions, especially within the Gryllidae.\n\"Cricket\" families.\nSeveral families and other taxa in the Ensifera may be called \"crickets\", including:\nIn human culture.\nFolklore and myth.\nThe folklore and mythology surrounding crickets is extensive. The singing of crickets in the folklore of Brazil and elsewhere is sometimes taken to be a sign of impending rain, or of a financial windfall. In Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca's chronicles of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the sudden chirping of a cricket heralded the sighting of land for his crew, just as their water supply had run out. In Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a black cricket in a room is said to portend illness; a grey one, money; and a green one, hope. In Alagoas state, northeast Brazil, a cricket announces death, thus it is killed if it chirps in a house. In Barbados, a loud cricket means money is coming in; hence, a cricket must not be killed or evicted if it chirps inside a house. However, another type of cricket that is less noisy forebodes illness or death.\nIn literature.\nCrickets feature as major characters in novels and children's books. Charles Dickens's 1845 novella \"The Cricket on the Hearth\", divided into sections called \"Chirps\", tells the story of a cricket which chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to a family. Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book \"Le avventure di Pinocchio\" (\"The Adventures of Pinocchio\") featured \"Il Grillo Parlante\" (The Talking Cricket) as one of its characters. George Selden's 1960 children's book \"The Cricket in Times Square\" tells the story of Chester the cricket from Connecticut who joins a family and their other animals, and is taken to see Times Square in New York. The story, which won the Newbery Honor, came to Selden on hearing a real cricket chirp in Times Square.\n\"Souvenirs entomologiques\", a book written by the French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre, devotes a whole chapter to the cricket, discussing its construction of a burrow and its song-making. The account is mainly of the field cricket, but also mentions the Italian cricket.\nCrickets have from time to time appeared in poetry. William Wordsworth's 1805 poem \"The Cottager to Her Infant\" includes the couplet \"The kitten sleeps upon the hearth, The crickets long have ceased their mirth\". John Keats's 1819 poem \"Ode to Autumn\" includes the lines \"Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft\". The Chinese Tang dynasty poet Du Fu (712–770) wrote a poem that in the translation by J. P. Seaton begins \"House cricket ... Trifling thing. And yet how his mournful song moves us. Out in the grass his cry was a tremble, But now, he trills beneath our bed, to share his sorrow.\"\nAs pets and fighting animals.\nCrickets are kept as pets and are considered good luck in some countries; in China, they are sometimes kept in cages or in hollowed-out gourds specially created in novel shapes. The practice was common in Japan for thousands of years; it peaked in the 19th century, though crickets are still sold at pet shops. It is also common to have them as caged pets in some European countries, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. Cricket fighting is a traditional Chinese pastime that dates back to the Tang dynasty (618–907). Originally an indulgence of emperors, cricket fighting later became popular among commoners. The dominance and fighting ability of males does not depend on strength alone; it has been found that they become more aggressive after certain pre-fight experiences such as isolation, or when defending a refuge. Crickets forced to fly for a short while will afterwards fight for two to three times longer than they otherwise would.\nAs food.\nIn the southern part of Asia, including Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, crickets commonly are eaten as a snack, prepared by deep frying soaked and cleaned insects. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization has implemented a project in Laos to improve cricket farming and, consequently, food security. The food conversion efficiency of house crickets (\"Acheta domesticus\") is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.\nCricket flour may be used as an additive to consumer foods such as pasta, bread, crackers, and cookies. Cricket flour is used in protein bars, pet foods, livestock feed, nutraceuticals, and other industrial applications. The United Nations says that the use of insect protein, such as cricket flour, could be critical in feeding the growing population of the planet while being less damaging to the environment.\nCrickets are also raised as food for carnivorous zoo animals, laboratory animals, and pets. They may be \"gut loaded\" with additional minerals, such as calcium, to provide a balanced diet for predators such as tree frogs (Hylidae).\nCommon expressions.\nBy the 19th century \"cricket\" and \"crickets\" were in use as euphemisms for using Christ as an interjection. The addition of \"Jiminy\" (a variation of \"Gemini\"), sometimes shortened to \"Jimmy\" created the expressions \"Jiminy Cricket!\" or \"Jimmy Crickets!\" as less blasphemous alternatives to exclaiming \"Jesus Christ!\"\nBy the end of the 20th century the sound of chirping crickets came to represent quietude in literature, theatre and film. From this sentiment arose expressions equating \"crickets\" with silence altogether, particularly when a group of assembled people makes no noise. These expressions have grown from the more descriptive, \"so quiet that you can hear crickets,\" to simply saying, \"crickets\" as shorthand for \"complete silence.\"\nIn popular culture.\nCricket characters feature in the Walt Disney animated movies \"Pinocchio\" (1940), where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character's conscience, and in \"Mulan\" (1998), where Cri-Kee is carried in a cage as a symbol of luck, in the Asian manner. The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly's rock and roll band; Holly's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets. \"Cricket\" is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an awkward joke, in a similar manner to tumbleweed."

Penn State head coach Russ Rose became the first Division I coach to win five NCAA titles.\nAustin Regional.\nRegional recap.\nThe biggest upset of the tournament occurred when Purdue swept top ranked Florida in 3 sets, recording their first win over a #1 team in program history. Despite holding 4 consecutive set points in the 1st set, Florida lost their 24-20 lead and eventually lost 28-26. Florida never seemed to regain their rhythm, as Purdue went up 8-0 in the second set and maintained a 10-point lead throughout the set, winning 25-15. Purdue went up early in the third set as well, and won 25-19, shocking the Gators who had only lost one match all season.\nIn the other semifinal, Illinois played Texas hard on their home floor, going up 2-1 in sets. However, Texas stormed back to win the fourth set easily and then took control of the fifth set, winning 15-11.\nIn the regional final, Purdue won the first set rather easily but lost their senior starting setter Jaclyn Hart to an apparent leg injury in the late stages of set 1. Hart did not end up returning in the match, as Texas dominated sets 2 and 3. Despite Purdue going up early and showing signs of life in what was the final set, Texas won the fourth set 27-25 to earn their third straight trip to the Final Four and a rematch of the 2009 NCAA Championship final with Penn State in the national semifinals.\nUniversity Park Regional.\nRegional recap.\nHaving upset the 5th overall seed in the tournament in the 1st round, Missouri advanced to the Sweet 16 to face 12th seeded Duke. Duke won in four sets, and advanced to the Elite Eight, which was the first time that an ACC team made it past the Sweet 16.\nPenn State downed Oklahoma in 3 sets, as senior All-American Blair Brown had 24 kills. In the regional final against Duke, Penn State won the first two sets rather easily, 25-19, 25-18, but Duke came back to win the third set 25-23. It was the first time since the 2006 tournament that Penn State lost a single set before the Final Four. In the fourth set, Penn State knocked off any chance of an upset, as they separated themselves early from Duke and won 25-17. Big Ten Freshman of the Year Deja McClendon had a career high 20 kills while Blair Brown added 16 kills. Penn State also extended their NCAA-record home court winning streak to 94 matches.\nDayton Regional.\nRegional recap.\nThird-seeded Stanford downed Ohio State in four sets, with the help of senior Alix Klineman's 29 kills. Southern California defeated Indiana in straight sets, setting up an All-Pac-10 regional final. In the regular season, Stanford beat Southern Cal both times.\nStanford jumped out to an early lead, winning the first set 25–20, however Southern Cal responded by winning the second set 25–17. With 11 tie scores and three lead changes, the third set was competitive but Stanford pulled out the win, 25–22. The fourth set was also a close battle, as it had 10 tie scores and three lead changes, but Southern Cal narrowly defeated Stanford, 26–24, and forced a fifth set. Despite having a 10–7 advantage in the decisive fifth set, Southern Cal responded to tie the set up at 11. Stanford held a match point at 14–13, but Southern Cal's freshman Falyn Fonoimoana, who was the top recruit in the 2010 class, recorded a kill to tie it up at 14. A Stanford hitting error gave Southern Cal match point, before a block by Fonoimoana and fellow freshman Alexis Olgard won the set, 16–14, and the match, 3–2.\nIt was the first time since the 2007 season that Southern Cal defeated Stanford. Alix Klineman finished her career with 2,008 kills, and joined former Stanford great Ogonna Nnamani as the only two players to have more than 2,000 career kills.\nSeattle Regional.\nRegional recap.\nSeventh seeded California swept Minnesota in 3 close sets, 26-24, 25-23, 25-23 to advance to the program's fourth straight NCAA Regional Final.\nIn the other Regional semifinal, unseeded Washington stunned overall #2 seeded Nebraska in four sets (25-16, 20-25, 25-21, 29-27). The fourth set of the match was considered controversial. Washington held a set point on which they hit a shot which might have been touched by the Nebraska block, but was ruled out, allowing Nebraska to tie up the set. Then Nebraska held a set point on which a kill attempt by Washington landed near the back line and was called in by the line judge, allowing Washington to tie up the set. Nebraska players and coaches were visibly upset as they thought they had won the point and started to celebrate. Washington then scored the next two points and won the match. When Nebraska head coach John Cook shook hands with Washington head coach Jim McLaughlin, he allegedly said \"The ball was out. Nice Match\" to which McLaughlin allegedly responded with foul language and had to be restrained. Both the controversial call and the coach incident were hot topics on the news outlets.\nCalifornia, which had already beaten Washington twice in the regular season, then swept the Huskies in the regional final (25-21, 25-20, 25-14).\nFinal Four - Sprint Center, Kansas City, Missouri.\nSemifinals recap.\nPenn State vs. Texas.\nIn the rematch of the 2009 finals, Penn State defeated Texas in straight sets, 25-13, 25-13, 25-22.

Penn State improved its all-time program record to 11-6 over Texas, and became the first team in NCAA history to advance to four straight NCAA Championship finals.\nCalifornia vs. Southern California.\nDespite USC defeating California in both Pac-10 matchups earlier in the season, California took control of the match from the start, going up 11-2 in set 1 and eventually defeating USC easily in a sweep, 25-14, 25-17, 25-20. Cal Junior All-American Tarah Murrey had 23 kills and hit .413, while Adrienne Gehan, a freshman, was second on the team with 14 kills. Cal setter Carli Lloyd, who was named the National Player of the Year the day after the match, had 39 assists and 16 digs in the match.

California advanced to the programs first ever final match to face the same team who ended their seasons in the NCAA tournament the previous three years.\nNational Championship recap: Penn State vs. California.\nPlaying each other for the fourth consecutive year in the tournament, Penn State defeated California once again in a sweep by the scores of 25-20, 27-25, 25-20.

Senior Blair Brown had 18 kills against the Bears, while Cal hitter Tarah Murrey led her team with 16 kills.\nIn set 1, Penn State held a slim 12-11 lead but kills by McClendon and Brown and a service ace from Alyssa D'Errico made the score 16-12. Cal fought back to cut the lead to 16-15, but Penn State pulled away again to lead 21-17. Two Brown kills and a kill from freshman Ariel Scott sealed the first set, 25-20. It was the first set Cal lost in the entire tournament.\nSet 2 was a battle throughout, and Cal took a 3-point lead at 17-14. However Penn State fought back to tie it at 17. Two Penn State blocks put them up 19-17, but Cal responded with kills and a block to make the score dead even at 20-20. Two straight Cal kills gave them set point 24-23, however Penn State tied it up at 24. 2010 National Player of the Year Carli Lloyd gave the Bears another set point at 25-24 with a kill, but Penn State used another crucial block to tie it up at 25. Two Brown kills won set 2 for the Nittany Lions, 27-25.\nCal stepped up its blocking in what was the final set, taking a 10-6 lead. However Penn State clawed its way back after a timeout and took a 13-12 lead. Freshman Ali Longo for Penn State ended up serving 8 straight points which included 3 service aces and Penn State went up 18-13. Cal came within 3 at 18-15 but another Penn State run put them up 23-16 and only 2 points away from the title. Cal outscored Penn State 4-2 in the final points, but a kill by freshman Katie Slay on an overpass sealed the set, 25-20, as Penn State went on to win their fourth straight NCAA title. Penn State seniors Brown, D'Errico, and Arielle Wilson went 24-0 in NCAA play their entire careers, and had a four-year overall record of 142-7. Wilson also graduated as the NCAA career hitting percentage leader."

        "text": "The ASEAN Basketball League (ABL) is an international professional men's basketball league in the East Asia, composed of eight teams, including six clubs from Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam), in addition to Hong Kong and Macau. Former teams have included Taiwan and Brunei. The league was proposed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and launched its inaugural season on 1 October 2009.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nBasketball officials from 6 ASEAN nations gathered in Metro Manila on 1 September 2009 to officially launch the new league. In its inaugural season, there were six participating teams from different nations in Southeast Asia:\nLeague expansion.\nOn 22 September 2011, the Brunei Barracudas announced that they were bowing out of the third season of ABL after participating for 2 seasons. On 20 October 2011, the Saigon Sports Academy officially announced the participation of Saigon Heat into the third season of ABL, making them the first ever international professional basketball team to represent Vietnam. In the same season, San Miguel Beermen and Bangkok Cobras joined the league along with Saigon Heat. Unfortunately, the Beermen left the ABL after winning the title in 2013. The Cobras also left the league after one season. Further, in 2014, Laskar Dreya South Sumatra (INA) joined and played for a season.\nIn 2015, Pilipinas MX3 Kings and Mono Vampire joined the league and both teams left in 2016. On 17 July 2016, Kaohsiung Truth from Kaohsiung, Taiwan announced that they will participate in the 2016–17 season. In the same year, the Eastern Basketball Club confirmed its participation in the league. The two teams were the first teams from outside Southeast Asia to compete in the league. The Philippines returned in the league with Alab Pilipinas on 6 August 2016. In September 2017, ABL confirmed four new teams for the 2017–18 season: CLS Knights Indonesia, Formosa Dreamers, the returning Mono Vampire Basketball Club, and the Nanhai Kung Fu after the Kaoshiung Truth disbanded after the seventh season of ABL.\nAfter the 2018 season, the Kung Fu moved to Macau and became the Macau Black Bears, while the league announced the addition of the Zhuhai Wolf Warriors, based in Zhuhai in the Pearl River delta. On 9 September 2019, the league confirmed the entry of the third team from Taiwan, Taipei Fubon Braves situated in Taipei after Formosa Dreamers and disbanded Kaohsiung Truth. Fubon Braves secured the best record in the Super Basketball League and capped it off with the SBL championship after sweeping the Finals series in four games. They are also one of the eight teams to compete in the 2019 FIBA Asia Champions Cup.\nCOVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty.\nThe 2019-20 ABL season was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 placing the status of the ABL in uncertainty. The withdrawal of Mono Vampires, the reports of Taiwanese teams planning to join a domestic league, and the inactivity of the league's social media site were among the factors that fueled speculations that the ABL itself would fold. However, an ABL co-owner dispelled such rumors committing the resumption of the league stating that they plan to hold the eleventh season in 2021. Plans to resume the league were postponed again with the new starting date for the season initially being in February 2022. The start date was pushed back again a month later to September. The plan did not proceed as planned. In October, the ABL through social media announced that it is returning without providing anymore details.\nAn invitational tournament was held in 2023 and won by Hong Kong Eastern, but on November 20, 2023, the league's uncertainty continued as FIBA had dropped support for the ABL and that the league is \"unlikely to play for the foreseeable future\" in a statement made by the Singapore Slingers.\nChampions.\nThe finals is a best-of-5 (2–2–1) series (2010, 2013, 2016–2019) and is a best-of-3 (1–1–1) series (2011, 2012, 2014, 2023)\nChampionship table by club.\nThis medal ranking is based on the club/team representation.\nIndividual awards.\nABL presents five individual awards to players: the Local MVP, World Import MVP, ASEAN Heritage MVP, and the Defensive Player of the Year. The Coach of the Year award is given to the league's best head coach of the season.\nPrior to the 2015–16 ABL season, there was only one MVP award for imports and was called the Best Import award. It was divided into two for World Imports (for players hailing from outside Southeast Asia and to the ASEAN Heritage Imports (for players from other Southeast Asian countries or players with at least one Southeast Asian parent). Also, the Defensive Player of the Year and Coach of the Year awards were only awarded since the 2012 season."

He was on the football and wrestling teams in college.\nHe founded the Freezer Queen frozen food company in Buffalo in 1958 and founded the Darien Lake theme park after purchasing of land in Genesee County, New York, in 1964, owning the resort and slowly developing it into a major amusement park until he sold the resort in 1983. He also briefly operated a (now demolished) Industrial Park located on the southeastern grounds of the Buffalo Niagara International Airport in the late 1980s. Snyder owned the Buffalo Hyatt Regency in the 1990s and opened the renowned E.B. Green's Steakhouse within the hotel.\nIn 1971, Snyder purchased the Buffalo Braves, which was an expansion team in the 1970-1971 NBA season, from the original hedge fund managers who had secured the expansion franchise. He sold the team in 1977, unable to compete with the much more successful Buffalo Sabres, who also debuted in the National Hockey League in 1970, or with the local college basketball teams, who were largely hostile toward professional basketball in Buffalo and managed to prevent Snyder from securing home games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. The franchise later moved to San Diego (in a complicated swap with the Boston Celtics), then to Los Angeles, where it plays as the Los Angeles Clippers."

Early in the 1973 season he was bothered by a chronic knee injury he suffered the prior season, which required season-ending surgery after 3 games to remove bone chips. He announced his retirement from pro football just before the start of the 1974 preseason.

        "title": "James Franklin (American football coach)",
        "text": "James Geoffrey Franklin (born February 2, 1972) is an American football coach and former player. Franklin has served as the head football coach at Penn State University since 2014 and served in the same position at Vanderbilt University from 2011 to 2013.\nEarly life and education.\nFranklin was born in Langhorne, Pennsylvania, on February 2, 1972, to James Oliver and Jocelyn \"Josie\" Franklin. \nHe attended Neshaminy High School in Langhorne, and then attended East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania, where he played as a quarterback all four years. In that position, he set seven school records and was a Division II player of the year nominee in 1994. \"Sports Illustrated\" named him a \"National Player of the Week\" that season. In 1995, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Franklin was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity while at East Stroudsburg.\nCoaching career.\nFranklin began his coaching career in 1995 coaching wide receivers at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. The following season, he took over as the coach of the defensive secondary for his alma mater, East Stroudsburg. That year, he was also the offensive coordinator for the Roskilde Kings of the Danish American Football Federation. In 1997, he became wide receivers coach at James Madison, and, the following year, became tight ends coach at Washington State. Franklin completed a master's degree in educational leadership at Washington State in 1999.\nIn 1999, he served as wide receivers coach at Idaho State. That year, the Bengals recorded 29 touchdowns, 258 receptions, and in excess of 3,300 passing yards for one of the best statistical seasons in school history. Idaho State ranked ninth nationally in total offense that year.\nFranklin has also held internships at several National Football League (NFL) franchises, including the Miami Dolphins, Philadelphia Eagles, and Minnesota Vikings.\nMaryland.\nFranklin first served at the University of Maryland as the wide receivers coach starting in 2000. In November 2000, head coach Ron Vanderlinden was dismissed and replaced by Ralph Friedgen, a Maryland alum and former Georgia Tech offensive coordinator. Friedgen retained Franklin as the wide receivers coach, one of only two assistants to be kept on the new coaching staff (running backs coach Mike Locksley was the other).\nIn 2003, Franklin's duties expanded to include the position of recruiting coordinator. Since then, he has been considered a top recruiter. His geographic areas of concentration for recruiting were Baltimore, Prince George's County, Maryland, Charles County, Maryland, and public schools in Washington, D.C. In 2005, Franklin departed Maryland to serve as the wide receivers coach for the Green Bay Packers of the NFL.\nIn 2008, he returned to Maryland as the offensive coordinator, assistant head coach, and head coach in waiting. Shortly before then coach Ralph Friedgen was fired in December 2010, he accepted the head coach position at Vanderbilt.\nKansas State.\nFranklin served at Kansas State University as the quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator for the 2006 and 2007 seasons. He joined head coach Ron Prince as the first coaching staff to follow the legendary Bill Snyder. During his tenure at K-State, Franklin nurtured record setting offensive talent; including the future NFL starters quarterback Josh Freeman and All-America wide receiver Jordy Nelson. Despite impressive wins over a top 5 team and an appearance in the inaugural Texas Bowl, the Wildcat program was a far cry from the title contending teams fielded during the Snyder era. Franklin left the Wildcat coaching staff prior to Ron Prince's 2008 dismissal, and subsequent return of Coach Bill Snyder.\nVanderbilt.\nVanderbilt considered Franklin a candidate for its head coaching position vacated with the forced resignation of interim coach Robbie Caldwell after the 2010 season. \"The Washington Post\" reported other candidates for the job were Al Golden of Temple and Larry Coker of UTSA (and formerly Miami), and that Franklin was not the frontrunner. After Auburn offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn turned down the job, Vanderbilt began talks to hire Franklin as its head coach. On December 17, Vanderbilt announced Franklin had been hired as head coach. Franklin was the first African American to be head coach of a major sport at Vanderbilt, and the third to be a head football coach in the Southeastern Conference (after Sylvester Croom, formerly at Mississippi State, and former Kentucky head coach Joker Phillips).\nFranklin led Vanderbilt to a bowl game in all three of his seasons as head coach, a team that had never previously participated in a bowl game in consecutive seasons, making him the only football coach in program history to do so.\n2011 season.\nFranklin finished the 2011 regular season with an overall record of 6–6 and a mark of 2–6 in conference play, finishing in a tie with Kentucky for fourth place in the SEC East. They were invited to the Liberty Bowl where they were defeated by Cincinnati 31–24 to finish the season 6–7 in 2011. The 2011 seniors for the Vanderbilt football team became the first class in program history to qualify for two bowl games while at the school. Vanderbilt had only been to four bowl games in school history. After starting the season with three wins and then three losses, the third to Georgia in a close game (33–28) that proved they could be competitive. The last three regular season losses were close games — to No. 8 Arkansas 31–28, at Florida 26–21, and at Tennessee in overtime 27–21. They then lost their bowl game to Cincinnati, 31–24. The team's only losses by more than seven points were at No. 12 South Carolina 21–3 and at No. 2 Alabama 34–0. Vanderbilt's six wins were by an average margin of 24 points. Even with a losing record, the 2011 team outscored their opponents 347 to 281.\n2012 season.\nIn his second season (2012), the Commodores finished 9–4 and ranked in both the Associated Press and USA Today end-of-season coaches' top 25 for the first time since 1948 (and the first ranking in any week since 2008). It was only the third nine-win season in school history, also was the first time since 1935 that Vandy won five SEC games in a year and the first time in 30 years that they won at home against Tennessee.\nThe 2012 team had numerous milestones. The longest road winning streak (4) since 1950. Longest win streak (7) since 1948. Most times scoring 40 (5) or more points since 1915. First Vandy player Zac Stacy to rush for over 3,000 yards in career, the first time since 1949 to 1951 that Vanderbilt beat rival Ole Miss in consecutive years. Jordan Matthews set a single-season record with 1,262 yards receiving. Kicker Carey Spear scored a school record 81 points. Largest margin of victory over rival Tennessee (23) 41–18 since 1954 (26–0). Largest margin of victory against secondary rival Kentucky (40) since 1916 when Vanderbilt won 45–0. First time a Vanderbilt team went to a bowl in back-to-back years. First win at home vs. Tennessee in 30 years. First 8-win season since 1982. Longest rush from scrimmage — 90 yards by Zac Stacy. First winning record in the regular season since 1982. Four straight wins in SEC play for the first time since 1949. The first time in Vanderbilt history a player (Zac Stacy) had rushed for over 1,000 yards back to back years. The first 9 win season since 1915.\nFranklin, convinced of the strength of Southeastern Conference football, ranked three SEC teams — Alabama, Georgia, and Florida — ahead of the consensus Number 1 Notre Dame in the final regular-season coaches poll for 2012.\n2013 season.\nFor the third straight year, Vanderbilt made it to a bowl game. Vandy defeated Houston Cougars in the BBVA Compass Bowl 41–24. Vanderbilt finished with 9 wins in consecutive years for the first time in school history, and was also ranked in the top 25 of AP and Coaches polls in back-to-back years for the first time.\nFour Vanderbilt football players were arrested on August 9, 2013, and charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. They took graphic photos and videos of the rape. \"BuzzFeed\" reported that Franklin encouraged a player to delete graphic footage of the rape after viewing it. Franklin denied the accusation. In court testimony, Franklin admitted to changing his story about whether he told Vanderbilt players that he had viewed a video recording of the incident.\nA minor controversy occurred when Vanderbilt canceled games at home with Northwestern and away games with Ohio State. A letter was sent cancelling the games, the explicit reason being the need to accommodate Mizzou into Vanderbilt's SEC East Division. Northwestern, like Vanderbilt in the SEC the sole private institution in the Big Ten, alleged that the real reason was fear on the part of Vanderbilt to continue playing its Big Ten counterpart—a series which had been referred to as the Battle of the Nerds.\nAdditionally, Vanderbilt's 25 combined wins in Franklin's three years in charge was the Commodores' highest total in school history. Franklin finished his Vanderbilt career with a record of 24–15 (an average of 8 wins per year).\nPenn State.\nOn January 11, 2014, the Athletic Department at Penn State announced the appointment of Franklin as the head football coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions. Penn State agreed to pay $1.5 million that Franklin owed Vanderbilt for early termination of his contract, Penn State disclosed this information January 24, 2014, according to USA TODAY Sports. He received a six-year contract, which paid him $4.3 million for the 2014 season, including a $300,000 retention bonus payable if he was Penn State's coach on December 31, 2014. He had an annual guaranteed pay increase of $100,000 along with retention bonuses, plus performance incentives each year. During his first few press conferences, he had said how he wanted Penn State to again be the most dominant school in recruiting in Pennsylvania.\nFranklin's departure from Vanderbilt was not without controversy, as his sudden move to Penn State upset most of Vanderbilt's fans. In the days following the move to Penn State; on January 7, 2014, James Franklin was forced to discuss the gang rape allegations by four of his former players at Vanderbilt. Penn State University president Rodney Erickson and director of athletics Dave Joyner said a deep background search and intense interview questions left them confident that hiring Franklin would not bring any more damage to Penn State University, which was still working through the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal that damaged the program in 2011.\n\"He has been through the most thorough vetting process that any individual has gone through at the university,\" Erickson said after a press conference at Beaver Stadium where Franklin made his first official appearance as a leader of Penn State.\n\"I've responded to some people who've said, 'I sure hope you've done your due diligence,'\" Joyner said. \"And I've told them, 'Trust me. We have done a very thorough vetting of this and we feel comfortable with the situation.' We're very, very careful and very methodical about doing that.\"\n2014 season.\nIn his first season with the Nittany Lions, Franklin led the team to a 6–6 regular season record. The season ended with a 31–30 victory over Boston College in the Pinstripe Bowl.\n2015 season.\nFranklin led the Nittany Lions' to a 7–5 regular season record. The season ended with a 24–17 loss to Georgia in the TaxSlayer Bowl.\n2016 season.\nDuring the 2016 season, Penn State started the season 2–2, but Franklin rallied his team to win the next eight games, winning the Big Ten's East Division, followed by a victory over Wisconsin in the 2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game. For his team's turn around, Franklin was named the Dave McClain Coach of the Year in the Big Ten.\nOn August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year. That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract.\n\"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"\nPenn State announced Franklin will make $4.3 million during the 2017 season as part of a contract will escalate each year through the 2022 season in which he will make $6.3 million. He has a $2 million buyout for the 2017 season and a $1 million buyout for every subsequent year.\nIn addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.\n2017 season.\nIn 2017, Franklin led the Nittany Lions to another 10–2 regular season, 7–2 in Big Ten games. They ended the season by defeating the Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, 35–28. Penn State finished the season 11–2, ranked #8 in both the AP and Coaches Poll.\n2018 season.\nPrior to the 2018 season, Penn State lost several key contributors from the previous seasons. Offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead left to become the head coach at Mississippi State, star Running Back Saquon Barkley was drafted as the 2nd overall draft pick by the New York Giants, and Tight End Mike Gesicki was drafted by the Miami Dolphins. The Nittany Lions took a step back from their recent success, finishing their regular season 9–3 overall and 6–3 in conference games. Following the regular season they played Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl, losing 27–24. Penn State finished the season 9–4, ranked #17 in the AP and Coaches Poll.\n2019 season.\nThe Nittany Lions finished the 2019 season 11–2, and had a conference record of 7–2. They received an invitation to the 2019 Cotton Bowl Classic where they defeated the #17 2019 Memphis Tigers 53–39. Penn State finished the 2019 season ranked #9 in both the AP Poll and Coaches Poll.\nPenn State announced at the end of the 2019 regular season that the board of trustees had confirmed unanimous approval of an extension of James Franklin contract after rumored interest from several other programs, including the USC Trojans and Florida State Seminoles.\n2020 season.\nPenn State's 2020 season was shortened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State got off to their worst start in school history in 2020, starting 0–5. They were able to rebound, however, by winning their last four games after that to finish 4–5. The season was scarred early on by the sudden retirement of starting running back Journey Brown due to a heart disease.\n2021 season.\nPenn State finished the regular season 7–5, and 4–5 in Big Ten play. The Nittany Lions, started the season off with a 5–0 record and with wins over #12 Wisconsin and #22 Auburn were ranked as high as #4 in the country. However, after an injury sustained by quarterback Sean Clifford, the team struggled towards the end of the season winning just two out of their final seven games. Prior to the regular-season finale against Michigan State, Franklin agreed to a 10-year, $75 million extension to remain as Penn State's head football coach through the 2031 season. The team was invited to the Outback Bowl and a matchup with Arkansas, the first ever meeting between the two schools. The Nittany Lions were defeated by a score of 24–10 to finish the season 7–6.\n2022 season.\nDespite losing impact players such as Jahan Dotson, Arnold Ebiketie, and Jaquan Brisker to the NFL Draft, the Nittany Lions rebounded going 10–2, only losing to top 4 ranked Michigan and Ohio State. Their performance secured the team a place in the Rose Bowl, where they would beat Utah to win their first Rose Bowl since 1995, ending the season 11–2. This marked Coach James Franklin's third New Years Six win with the Nittany Lions, and his first Rose Bowl win.\n2023 season.\nPenn State started the 2023 season ranked 7th in the AP Poll. Franklin and the Nittany Lions started off 6–0 before an undefeated matchup against #3 Ohio State. Ohio State won 20–12 to give the Nittany Lions their first loss. Penn State won four of their next five with the lone loss coming to #2 Michigan. Penn State qualified for the Peach Bowl, where they lost 38–25 to Ole Miss to finish 10–3.\nPersonal life.\nWhile serving as the tight ends coach at Washington State, Franklin met his wife Fumi (then a student at Washington State) in 1998.

He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from 1975 until 1979 for the Houston Astros and San Francisco Giants. He is the younger brother of Mike Andrews. \nAfter spending one year at El Camino Junior College, where he did not play any sports, Andrews was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1970 amateur draft, but would never play for the team. He was traded along with Enos Cabell from the Orioles to the Astros for Lee May and Jay Schlueter at the Winter Meetings on December 3, 1974. Even though he batted over .300 in each of the previous two seasons in the minors, Andrews was expendable because Bobby Grich was well established as the Orioles' starting second baseman. Andrews made his major league debut on April 7, 1975, recording two hits in a 6-2 Astros' win over the Atlanta Braves. That season, he had the distinction of recording at least one base hit in each of his first five major league games.\nAndrews hit his first major league home run in the ninth inning of a nationally televised game on Monday night, July 17, 1978, off Buddy Schultz of the St. Louis Cardinals. The home run turned out to be the difference in a 9-7 Giants win.\nAfter two seasons in Houston, he was dealt along with cash from the Astros to the Giants for Willie Crawford and Rob Sperring during spring training on March 26, 1977. He was released by the Giants after the 1979 season, making his final major league appearance in a pinch hit at bat on September 26, 1979, against Lerrin LaGrow of the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)"

        "text": "The Delhi Golf Club (DGC) is a prominent golf club situated in Delhi, India. It has ultra restrictive membership, with well over a waiting period of over 50 years for prospective members. It is close to Delhi's top tourist sites of India Gate, Humayun's Tomb, Delhi Zoo, and Lodhi Gardens. DGC comprises 18-hole course designed by the Gary Player Design studio, which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and a shorter 9-hole course, and sprawling club house with swimming pool.\nHistory.\nThe original course, called the Lodhi Golf Club, laid out in the 1930s by the then Chief of the Horticultural Department, was much larger than the present walled area, and included parts of present Golf Links and Kaka Nagar. The Lodhi Golf Club, however, had few members, and was barely sustainable, except for a brief period during the Second World War when Delhi was awash with Allied officers who patronized the club. In 1948, the club had eighty members, and in 1951, when it became the Delhi Golf Club (DGC), its membership was no more than 120, and was barely sustainable. The Club was saved from dissolution by Indian officers belonging to the Indian Civil Service, including Dharma Vira, founder member of the DGC, who petitioned Prime Minister Nehru to lease the government land to the club at a low annual rent for thirty years. Since that time, the Government of India has favored the DGC with very permissive lease terms and low annual rents that have no relationship to the actual value of the land. The DGC has evolved as a favorite watering hole for senior Civil Servants, Police Officers and the business and social elite. The walled area of the club includes a large number of interesting Mughal archeological remains such as the famous Lal Bangla.\nCourse.\nThe course comprises the championship 18-hole \"Lodhi Course\", which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and the shorter 9-hole \"Peacock Course\". The latter came into being when the course was re-designed by Peter Thomson in 1976–77. The DGC hosts various tournaments and cups, such as the Indian Open. In 2019 the Gary Player Design firm completely redesigned the golf course.\nSubsidy.\nThe Delhi Golf Club has an area of 220 acres. The DGC club house, including the course, is on government land. In 2012, eight years before the lease was due for renewal, Kamal Nath, the Minister of Urban Development in the United Progressive Alliance government, approved extension of the lease until 2050.\nManagement committee.\nThe DGC management committee consists of a President, a Course Captain and twelve general committee members, excluding government nominated members. Posts on the management committee are filled through election. These are usually held in September.\nPresident.\nMaj. Ravinder Singh Bedi (Retd) has been appointed as president for 2019–2020.\nCaptain.\nMr. Rohit Sabherwal, FCA has been appointed as captain for 2019–2020.\nClub amenities.\nThe DGC has a large bungalow style club house with extensive lawns, gazebos, several indoor and outdoor bars, restaurants, a gym, a sauna, a pro shop and a large parking designated area.\nAir quality.\nThe DGC, despite its many acres, has not escaped Delhi's poor air quality. In the evening illumination, as well as the early morning sun, \"the shroud of carcinogenic particles hovering above the bunkers and greens\" are very visible.\nAllegations of racism and elitism.\nIn June 2017, a woman named Tailin Lyngdoh, a Khasi, had gone to the Club along with her employer Nivedita Barthakur after they were invited for lunch by a member of the Club. However, 15–20 minutes into the lunch, two Club officials asked Lyngdoh to leave the table saying the dress (Jainsem) she was wearing was a \"maid's uniform\" which looked like a \"dustbin\" and also allegedly hurled racial abuse at her. This incident was widely covered in the Indian media condemning the classism attitude of the Delhi Golf Club and elite clubs of India in general."

This became possible only when the Sports Federation was founded in September 1945, when it was created at the technical committee level, dealing with the design of sporting calendar and organizing national activities. They were organized into three sections. One of them was that of sports games, which was part of sportive Inspector Manual, covering, among other things, basketball. With this setup work became possible to have a structure and a person directly in charge of the basketball problems. \nIn this way the conditions were met for the creation in 1946 of the Albanian Basketball Federation (FSHB). Now our country had a specialized institution that followed and led the development of the Albanian basketball in the country, but also formally represent our country in foreign relations for basketball, but their connections abroad were still held by the Albanian Sports Federation, which kept ties with federations international.

They play their home games at the Ford Center. Evansville's athletics teams were originally known as the Pioneers in the early part of the 1900s. In the 1920s, the name Aces arose after a local sports writer wrote in a game story of the men's basketball team, \"They played like Aces.\" The team has been known as the Aces and/or Purple Aces ever since. Evansville has won five Division II national championships (1959, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1971). \nOn November 12, 2019, the Aces earned one of the biggest victories in their Division I history, upsetting top-ranked Kentucky at Rupp Arena.

It was founded in 1946 shortly after the formation of the Albanian Basketball Association and is now divided into two divisions, the Superliga and First Division, consisting of 12 teams each. The team with the most championships is BC Partizani Tirana who have won 33 championships in total, but none since 1996.\nHistory.\nThe Albanian Basketball League is one of the oldest continuing basketball competitions in the region of the Balkans, having started in 1946. The league was formed less than two years after the Communist Party of Albania gained control of the country, and the sport gradually grew in popularity over the years before experiencing a rapid rise in popularity in the 1970s, leading to most cities and towns in Albania forming their own basketball clubs and building basketball grounds. Following the fall of communism in 1991 many basketball clubs were forced to fold due to lack of any investment, which led to the decline in the popularity of the sport as a whole in the country. However, since 1993 there has been some re-establishment of the folded teams as private investment along with some state funded has allowed teams to continue functioning.\nCompetition.\nThe Albanian Basketball League consists of 12 teams, grouped evenly into two divisions, the Superliga and First Division. As each group contains 6 teams, they play each other four times in two separate phases during the regular season, once at home and once away in each phase. This means each team plays 20 games each during the regular season. A win in the regular season is worth two points and a loss is worth one point. At the end of the regular season the bottom two sides miss out on the play-offs, while the bottom club gets relegated from the Superliga to the First Division, the fifth placed side has to compete for a place in the Superliga against the second ranked team in the First Division.\nFollowing the end of the regular season, the top four teams qualify for he play-offs, where the team which finished first plays the team which finished fourth while the second and third ranked teams play against each other. A winner is decided in the play-offs once a team has reached two victories, and they take it in turns to play at home until the two victories are reached. The finals is played between the two winners of the Superliga play-offs, with each team taking it in turns to play at home until one side has reached three victories."

        "title": "2012 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2012 UEFA Champions League final was an association football match which took place on Saturday, 19 May 2012 between Bayern Munich of Germany and Chelsea of England at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany. The match was to decide the winner of the 2011–12 season of the UEFA Champions League, Europe's premier club football tournament. Bayern were making their ninth appearance in the competition's final, having won four and lost four, most recently losing in 2010. Chelsea were appearing in their second final, having lost their first in 2008.\nIt was the first Champions League final to be held at the Allianz Arena (known as Fußball Arena München for the final). As tenants of the Arena, this meant Bayern were the first finalists to have home advantage since 1984. Both teams progressed to the knockout stages by finishing top of their group. Bayern then beat Basel, Marseille and Real Madrid to reach the final, while Chelsea knocked out Napoli, Benfica and defending champions Barcelona.\nBayern took the lead late in the second half through Thomas Müller, but Didier Drogba equalised for Chelsea five minutes later to take the game to extra time, in which Arjen Robben missed an awarded penalty, Petr Čech saving the low drive. The teams stayed level at 1–1 and the match went to a penalty shoot-out, which Chelsea won 4–3 to clinch their first Champions League title. In doing so, they became the first London club to win the tournament, the fifth English club and 22nd overall.\nAs winners, Chelsea took part in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup, losing 4–1 to Atlético Madrid, the winners of the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. The victory also allowed them to enter the following season's Champions League competition (having failed to qualify for it by their league finishing position) at the expense of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who would otherwise have entered the competition having finished fourth in the Premier League. Chelsea also represented UEFA at the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup, entering at the semi-final stage; however, they were beaten 1–0 by Corinthians in the final.\nVenue.\nThe Allianz Arena was announced by UEFA as the venue of the 2012 final on 30 January 2010, although the stadium was referred to as \"Fußball Arena München\" for the match, as UEFA does not recognise sponsorship by companies that are not among its partner organisations. The stadium, which opened in 2005, was then the home stadium of both Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, and was used for six matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup including the opening match.\nThe stadium was hosting its first major European final. The Olympiastadion in Munich, the previous home of Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, hosted three European Cup finals; in 1979, 1993 and 1997. On each previous occasion, a European Cup final held in Munich had produced a first-time winner of the competition (Nottingham Forest, Olympique Marseille and Borussia Dortmund).\nDuring the match, the stadium was illuminated in green and turquoise to represent the official UEFA emblem of the Munich final, as the outer shell of the Allianz Arena can change colour.\nBackground.\nTo reach the final, in the knockout phase Bayern defeated Basel, Marseille, and Real Madrid (3–1 on penalties after a 3–3 aggregate score), while Chelsea overcame Napoli, Benfica, and the defending champions Barcelona (3–2 on aggregate).\nBoth teams reached the final having already lost out in their domestic leagues (the Bundesliga and Premier League respectively), but having also reached the final of their domestic cup competitions (the DFB-Pokal and FA Cup respectively), to be played prior to the Champions League final. Chelsea won the FA Cup by defeating Liverpool 2–1 thus were chasing a double, while Bayern lost the Final of the DFB-Pokal 5–2 to Borussia Dortmund.\nBoth clubs had lost their most recent Champions League final – Bayern in 2010 to Inter Milan 2–0 and Chelsea in 2008 in an all-English clash with Manchester United on penalties after a 1–1 draw. While that was Chelsea's only Champions League final, Bayern had previously played in eight Champions League/European Cup finals, winning four (1974, 1975, 1976, 2001) and losing four (1982, 1987, 1999 and 2010). The clubs had only met each other once in Europe before, with Chelsea winning 6–5 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League.\nThe match was the fourth occasion that a team had reached a final of the European Cup which was scheduled to be played at their own home ground, after 1957, 1965 and 1984, and the first occasion since the tournament was rebranded to the UEFA Champions League. For this reason, fans of Bayern Munich called the match \"Finale dahoam\" (Bavarian for \"final at home\"). This was the first time since 2007 that neither of the participants were current champions of their domestic league. This was the sixth time that an English side and a German side had met in a European Cup/Champions League final; the other occasions were 1975, 1977, 1980, 1982 and 1999. It was also Bayern's fourth time facing an English side in the European Cup/Champions League final, having won in 1975 vs. Leeds United and lost in 1982 vs. Aston Villa and 1999 to Manchester United.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nPre-match.\nTicketing.\nThe two teams each received 17,500 tickets to distribute to their supporters. A further 7,000 tickets were available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com, with prices between €70 and €370. The remaining tickets were allocated to the local organising committee, UEFA's 53 national football associations, and commercial and broadcast partners.\nAmbassador.\nFormer German player Paul Breitner was named as the ambassador for the final.\nOfficials.\nIn May 2012, Pedro Proença, the Portuguese referee was selected to oversee the final. Joining him, was fellow Portuguese officials Bertino Miranda and Ricardo Santos as assistant referees, Jorge Sousa and Duarte Gomes as additional assistant referees, Tiago Trigo as reserve assistant referee, and Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo as fourth official.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe UEFA Champions League Anthem was performed by German tenor Jonas Kaufmann and violinist David Garrett.\nFestival and live screenings.\nThe UEFA Champions Festival was held at Munich's Olympiapark from 16 to 19 May. An official public screening of the final took place at the Olympiastadion during the match, with capacity for 65,000 fans, including a section for Chelsea supporters. A second public screening was planned on the Theresienwiese, where the famous Oktoberfest takes place.\nMatch.\nTeam selection.\nBoth clubs had players missing due to suspensions; Bayern were missing David Alaba, Holger Badstuber and Luiz Gustavo, while Chelsea were without Branislav Ivanović, Raul Meireles, Ramires and John Terry. Terry was suspended after being sent off in the semi-final, which automatically excludes a player from the final. The other six all received yellow cards in the semi-finals, which took them over the limit of a third yellow card of the competition, which triggers an automatic suspension from the next match. Players union FIFPro appealed to UEFA to allow the players with yellow cards to play, seeing the punishment of \"missing the match of your life\" as too harsh; UEFA rejected the appeal and stated the rule would not be reviewed for at least three years. Ivanović stated how he \"had no idea [he] was one booking away from missing the Champions League final.\" UEFA confirmed that Chelsea captain Terry would be allowed to lift the trophy should Chelsea win, despite his suspension. Ryan Bertrand also got his initial first-team start as a left winger ahead of his regular left back position.\nOnly two of the 36 players had previously been in a winning squad in a Champions League final: Chelsea's Paulo Ferreira and José Bosingwa were in the Porto squad in 2004. Ten of the Bayern 18 had earlier been in their squad that lost the 2010 final, although only four started both games: Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Arjen Robben and Thomas Müller. Eight of the Chelsea squad had been in their losing 2008 squad, including four who started both games: Petr Čech, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba.\nMatch summary.\nBayern had control for most of the match, with Robben having the best chance, which Čech deflected onto the frame of the goal with his legs. Chelsea, however, also had chances, with Salomon Kalou nearly finishing at the near post. Bayern kept pushing Chelsea to the limit but missed sitters from Mario Gómez, who sent his shot over the bar; and Robben, who was blocked at the last second by Gary Cahill. Bayern took the lead in the 83rd minute, when Toni Kroos crossed in to Müller, who headed the ball down into the ground, causing it to bounce over Čech and in off the crossbar. Bayern took Müller off and replaced him with Daniel Van Buyten in an attempt to strengthen the defence. However, on 88 minutes, Chelsea won their first corner kick of the match, and when Juan Mata swung it in, Drogba got to it first and powered a header past Manuel Neuer at the near post for the equaliser. Chelsea won a free kick just outside the area in the 93rd minute, but Drogba smashed it over. \nThe game went to extra time, and Bayern had the first good chance of the extra 30 minutes when Ivica Olić inside the box passed to Gómez, but his shot was wide. Later, Drogba fouled Franck Ribéry in the penalty area, injuring him and earning Bayern a penalty; Robben took it, but his shot was saved by Čech. In the second half of extra time, Olić attempted to set up Van Buyten instead of taking a shot and the ball rolled wide of Čech's far post.\nFor the first time since 2008, when Chelsea had lost to Manchester United, the European Cup would be decided by penalties. Lahm went first and scored to Čech's left, as Čech got his fingertips to the ball but was unable to keep it out. Mata took Chelsea's first penalty and his weak shot was saved by Neuer. Next was Gómez, who drilled his shot into the bottom-right corner. David Luiz took Chelsea's second penalty and scored with a powerful shot into the top corner after a long run up. Goalkeeper Neuer took Bayern's third penalty, and Čech went the right way again but was unable to keep his opposite number's low shot from creeping past him into the bottom-left corner. Lampard was next and he scored with a hard shot high and down the middle. Olić was next and taking his final competitive kick for Bayern, but Čech saved to his left. Cole then slotted his kick into the bottom-right corner just out of Neuer's reach to level the scores at 3–3 and hasten sudden death. Schweinsteiger, who had scored Bayern's decisive fifth penalty against Real Madrid's Iker Casillas in the semi-finals, was their fifth penalty taker again. However, Čech tipped his effort onto the post, having gone the correct direction for every Bayern penalty, to leave Chelsea one kick away from winning the trophy. In 2008, Drogba had missed out on taking Chelsea's fifth penalty against Manchester United, having been sent off in extra time; now in the same position, Drogba sent Neuer the wrong way and put his kick into the bottom-left corner to win it for Chelsea. It proved to be his final kick as a Chelsea player until his return in 2014.\nThe victory marked not only Chelsea's first ever European Cup, but also the first time a London team had won the competition – previously, aside from Chelsea's 2008 defeat to United, which was the last time an English club had won the competition, Arsenal had also lost the 2006 final in Paris against Barcelona.\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLegends of Europe reunion match.\nOn 9 September 2023, the two clubs played a legends match at Stamford Bridge to benefit The Chelsea Foundation and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. The match was also in memory of former Chelsea and Italy player Gianluca Vialli, who had died at the Royal Marsden Hospital on 6 January of pancreatic cancer at the age of 58. \nChelsea included most of their team from the 2012 final and also included captain Terry and Ramires, who had both missed the final due to suspension, and Michael Essien, who was an unused substitute in 2012. Gianfranco Zola, Jody Morris and Salomon Kalou were among the players who returned, and Di Matteo also returned to manage the side. Bayern Munich included only Van Buyten from their 2012 team but included a number of their players from their 2001 team that had beaten Valencia in Milan, including Owen Hargreaves, Giovane Elber and Thomas Linke. 2001 captain Stefan Effenberg also co-managed alongside Raimond Aumann. Chelsea won 4–0 with goals from Essien, Terry, Cahill and Tiago Mendes."

The game was held on July 12, 1955, at Milwaukee County Stadium, the home of the Milwaukee Braves of the National League.\nSummary.\nThe National League overcame a five-run deficit to defeat the American League, 6–5, in this edition of the midsummer classic. Stan Musial led off the bottom of the 12th inning by drilling a home run to deep right field on the first pitch from Frank Sullivan, pulling off one of the greatest victories in All-Star Game history.\nThe National League began their comeback in the bottom of the seventh inning. Willie Mays led off the frame with a single off Whitey Ford, and after two outs, Hank Aaron walked and Johnny Logan singled to drive home Mays and make it a 5–1 game. Next batter Stan Lopata reached base on an error, and Aaron scored the second run off the inning before the third out was made.\nWith two outs in the eight inning, Mays, Ted Kluszewski and Randy Jackson hit consecutive singles for a run, and Ford was replaced by Sullivan. Aaron greeted him with an RBI single scoring Kluszewski to knot the game at 5–5.\nThe American League quickly took the lead in the top of the first inning when Harvey Kuenn and Nellie Fox hit consecutive singles against Robin Roberts, with Kuenn advancing to third base from first and later scoring on a wild pitch. Then Ted Williams walked and Mickey Mantle hit a three-run home run, before Roberts recorded his first out. In the sixth inning, Mickey Vernon grounded out to drive home Yogi Berra to give the American League a five-run cushion.\nIn the ninth inning, Joe Nuxhall and Sullivan matched strikeouts as the All-Star Game went into extra innings for only the second time since 1950, which turned out to be the first year the game went more than nine innings.\nThe contest remained tied until the 12th inning, when Gene Conley struck out all three AL batters he faced. Then came the walk-off by Musial, which was his fourth homer in All-Star games, breaking a tie with Ted Williams and Ralph Kiner.\nIt was the fifth victory for the National League in the last six All-Star games, even though the American League still held a 13–9 overall advantage.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nLine Score.\n\"Play-by-play at Retrosheet\""

Interestingly, Omaha had no fewer than four nicknames during this time including the Omahogs, Indians, Rangers, and Rourkes.\nAfter taking off a few years from baseball (he had retired in 1910), Dolan played one more season in 1913 for the Bangor Maroons at age 40. He batted .267 in 64 games (it was a 66-game season), but the league in which he played, the New Brunswick-Maine League, folded after only one season."
