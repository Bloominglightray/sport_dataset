        "title": "2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game",
        "text": "The championship game of the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was contested on April 4, 2022 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The game featured the Kansas Jayhawks of the Big 12 Conference and the North Carolina Tar Heels of the Atlantic Coast Conference. This was a rematch of the 1957 national championship game, in which undefeated North Carolina defeated Kansas by a 54-53 score in triple-overtime to win their first-ever national championship. \nKansas narrowly defeated North Carolina to claim their first national championship since 2008. The victory marked Kansas's fourth national championship, and their second under head coach Bill Self. Trailing 38–22 near the end of the first half, Kansas rallied from a 16-point deficit for the largest comeback win in the championship game's history. The Jayhawks' Ochai Agbaji was named the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the 2022 tournament.\nParticipants.\nIt was the second national championship game between the schools after North Carolina's triple-overtime victory over Kansas in 1957.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nNorth Carolina was led by first-year head coach Hubert Davis, a former Tar Heels player who took over for Roy Williams, who also coached at Kansas and had recently retired. The Tar Heels were on the bubble for an NCAA Tournament invite with an 18–8 record in mid-February, having suffered double-digit losses to Tennessee, Kentucky, Miami, Wake Forest and Duke. After qualifying for the tournament as a No. 8 seed, they advanced to the title game with wins over Marquette, in the most lopsided NCAA tournament game between a No. 8 seed and a No. 9 seed; UCLA; the defending national champion Baylor; the tournament's Cinderella, Saint Peter's; and their biggest rival, Duke. Guard Caleb Love scored 22 of his game-high 28 points in the second half against Duke. Earlier in the tournament in the Sweet 16, he scored 27 of his game-high 30 in the second half in their win over UCLA. Forward Armando Bacot entered the game averaging over 16 points and 13 rebounds per game, and guard Caleb Love was expected to match up well defensively with Kansas guard Ochai Agbaji. The Tar Heels were attempting to become the second No. 8 seed to win the tournament, joining Villanova in 1985. Davis was seeking to become the first Division I men’s basketball coach to win a national championship in his first full season. He was the tenth first-year coach to lead a team to the Final Four.\nKansas Jayhawks.\nKansas was coached by Bill Self, who reached the Final Four for the fourth time in his career. They had seven players returning from their 2019–20 squad, which was 28–3 and odds-on favorite to win the national title before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ochai Agbaji was named an All-American, and led the Big 12 Conference in scoring and was voted the Big 12 Player of the Year. The Jayhawks duo of David McCormack and Mitch Lightfoot provided production on the inside, while guard Remy Martin emerged during the Big 12 tournament, after having struggled with a nagging injury throughout the season. Kansas received the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament's Midwest Regional. On their way to the championship game, the Jayhawks defeated Texas Southern, Creighton, Providence, Miami, and Villanova. Martin was the team's leading scorer for three games during the tournament. After defeating Providence in the Sweet 16, Kansas passed Kentucky for the most wins in Division I men's college basketball history.\nGame summary.\nKansas won the jump ball to begin the game and opened the scoring 21 seconds later when Ochai Agbaji made a three-point shot. The Jayhawks began the game on a 7–0 run with David McCormack's jumper and a pair of free throws by Jalen Wilson. North Carolina's first points of the game were made by Brady Manek, who made a three-point shot with two and a quarter minutes elapsed. The Tar Heels made up ground and tied the game at 11 points apiece with 13:30 on the clock with a layup by Leaky Black, free throws by Caleb Love, and another layup by Armando Bacot. A free throw by Bacot as part of a three-point play gave North Carolina their first lead, 12–11, but a pair of field goals shortly thereafter by Christian Braun and Mitch Lightfoot gave the edge back to Kansas. Love's three-point shot with 9:21 remaining tied the contest back at 18 points each, and the teams traded field goals for the next three minutes, when the score tied again at 22–22. Manek's three-pointer a few seconds later began a large run for the Tar Heels which saw them score 16 unanswered points. Leading 38–22 with 2:23 until halftime after a pair of free throws made by Bacot, Agbaji made a free throw of his own to end Kansas's scoring drought. From there, Agbaji and Puff Johnson traded field goals in the last thirty seconds of the half, giving North Carolina a 40–25 lead at halftime.\nNorth Carolina began the second half with possession of the ball, but the Jayhawks' offense got them off to a 6–0 run. Love made a three-pointer for North Carolina, pushing the Tar Heels' lead back up to 12 points. The teams traded field goals before Kansas went on another run, this time scoring eight unanswered points by way of Braun, Wilson, Agbaji, and Harris Jr., cutting the lead to four points. Bacot made a free throw to end North Carolina's scoring drought, but a jump shot from McCormack and a layup from Braun narrowed the lead to one point. With 10:53 remaining, Agbaji made a free throw as part of a three-point play to tie the game at 50 points apiece, and a three-pointer by Remy Martin gave Kansas the lead thirty seconds later. Another three-point play by Wilson pushed the Jayhawks' advantage to six points, capping a 31–10 run. North Carolina responded over the next two minutes, evening the score at 57 with 8:17 to play. A pair of three-pointers by Martin and Wilson for Kansas, and two layups from Johnson for North Carolina, kept Kansas' lead at two points entering the game's final five minutes.\nThe score evened at 65 following two free throws by Manek, and North Carolina took a 69–68 lead with 1:41 remaining following a layup by Manek. After McCormack made a go-ahead jumper at 1:21, Love had his shot blocked out-of-bounds on a drive. After the ensuing inbound, Carolina missed a shot, but the Tar Heels got the offensive rebound. Bacot received the ball and was driving to the basket when he turned his ankle and fell to the ground in pain (due to the floor giving out). He turned the ball over, then limped off the court and was not able to return. Manek then guarded McCormack instead of Bacot, who was a better defender, and the Jayhawks' big man made a jumper over Manek to increase the lead to three. The Tar Heels missed their final four shots, including Love's desperation three-pointer at the final buzzer. The Jayhawks won 72–69, outscoring the Tar Heels 47–29 in the second half.\nThe 16-point deficit that Kansas overcame was the largest ever to win a men's national championship game, surpassing the previous record of 15 points by Loyola-Chicago in 1963. The Jayhawks 15-point hole at halftime was the largest second-half comeback in a championship, eclipsing Kentucky's 10-point rally in 1998. Agbaji finished with 12 points and was named the NCAA Tournament MOP. McCormack and Wilson led the Jayhawks with 15 points each. Braun scored 10 of his 12 in the second half, when Martin also had 11 of his 14. Bacot ended with 15 points and 15 rebounds, becoming the first to record a double-double in all six tournament games. North Carolina made just 11 of its 40 shots in the second half. This was Kansas's fourth national championship in school history and the second under head coach Bill Self.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by TBS, with TNT and truTV simulcasting the game. Jim Nantz provided play-by-play, while Bill Raftery and Grant Hill provided color commentary. Tracy Wolfson served as the sideline reporter. ESPN International had the international rights to the championship game and the Final Four. It was called by Brian Custer and Jay Bilas.\nThe game was the third-most-viewed college basketball telecast in cable television history, just one spot behind the Final Four matchup between North Carolina and Duke that was played two days prior. The telecast recorded an average of 18.1 million viewers, up 4 percent from the previous season's championship game."

        "text": "The New Zealand women's cricket team toured England to play the England women's cricket team in September 2021. The tour consisted of three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) and five Women's One Day International (WODI) matches.\nEngland won the first WT20I match by 46 runs, with New Zealand winning the second match by four wickets to level the series. England won the third WT20I match by four wickets to win the series 2–1. England won the first two WODI matches by 30 runs and 13 runs respectively to take a 2–0 lead in the series. On the day before the third WODI, a member of the New Zealand team management received a bomb threat, but the threat was deemed \"not credible\". The match went ahead as scheduled, with New Zealand winning by three wickets. England won the fourth WODI by three wickets to win the series with a match to spare. England won the fifth WODI by 203 runs to win the series 4–1.\nSquads.\nNew Zealand did not name individual squads for the WODI and WT20I matches, opting instead to name a combined squad of sixteen players for the tour. In August 2021, Rosemary Mair was ruled out of New Zealand's squad due to an injury. Molly Penfold was added to the squad as Mair's replacement.\nMaia Bouchier and Charlie Dean earned their maiden call-ups to the England team for the WT20I matches. However, both players were ruled out of the first match after being identified as possible COVID-19 contacts, with Emma Lamb being added to England's squad. Anya Shrubsole was ruled out of England's squad for the first two WODI matches due to an ankle injury. Maia Bouchier was added to the WODI squad ahead of the third match of the series, but was released before the fifth match to enable her to play in the 2021 Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy final.\nTour match.\nAhead of the tour, New Zealand played a warm-up match against the England A team, with England A winning by four wickets."

        "text": "The 1922–23 Penn Quakers men's ice hockey season was the 11th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAt the start of the season, Penn was able to get Eddie Powers to coach both the ice hockey and lacrosse teams. Early in the season the team had difficulty in getting ice time to practice. Despite the difficulty, there was some optimism surrounding the team as only one player was lost due to graduation and, with the club having played well, there was hope that the team could get over the hump in 1923.\nThe team played its first game just after returning from the Christmas break when they travelled to West Point. Playing through a blizzard, the two teams fought in a rough game that required overtime but Army ended up as the victor. An exhibition game came less than a week later when Penn arrived at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink for the first time. Before the game began the Quakers were already at a disadvantage due to a lack of practice and lost their captain, Wanamaker, to a leg injury. The result was a complete demolition by the Tigers to the tune of 13–1. The team's second practice didn't occur until after the second game and, judging by the score, was sorely needed.\nThe biggest problem was having to contend with the lack of funds for the program. Due to the only available rink being the Philadelphia Ice Palace, Penn had to pay every time they wanted to use the facility. That wasn't a problem for games, as they would be able to recoup the cost with ticket sales, but practices were an expense the team, as a minor program, couldn't readily afford. Entering the next game the team was able to practice several times, but the most important aspect for the team was the attendance. The administration was having second thoughts about continuing the expensive program and would only allow it to continue if a significant number of spectators would show. The team performed well but lost the match 0–2. They did, however, draw a crowd of 1,200 and the team was allowed to continue.\nDuring the examination period, Penn won its first game of the year when they downed an old foe, Swarthmore, but were stomped by a surging Yale squad before the week was out. The much smaller rink proved a hindrance to the Quakers, but the team forged ahead despite the loss. After a game against Lafayette was cancelled, Coach Powers left the team to handle a family illness. The team took care of itself in his absence and prepared for their game against Cornell. The team played its best all-around game of the year, earning a tie against the Big Red which included three extra periods.\nThe Quakers ended their season with a rematch against Princeton. With much more experience under their belt, the team was expected to play the Tigers much more effectively than they had back in January. The game started slowly but a 5-goal middle period from the visitors handed Penn another loss and the team ended the year with a poor record but had hope for the future with the team's renewed popularity.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

In 1889, the Camden team was a member of the Independent level Delaware State League, finishing in fourth place in a shortened season. The Camden team played without a known nickname, as was common in the era.\nHistory.\nThe Camden team was a charter member when the 1889 Delaware State League began minor league play as an Independent five–team league. The Delaware State League was formed with the Delaware teams of Dover, Milford, Smyrna and Wilmington Peach Growers teams joining Camden as charter members.\nEvolving from local semi–professional baseball, the Delaware State League structure allowed each team to pay eight players and the league had no residency requirements. The league began play with controversy over Dover’s signing of Bill Higgins, who had played in 14 major league games for the Boston Beaneaters the previous season. Smyrna claimed they had also signed Higgins. Dover threatened to fold their franchise over the dispute and review of the situation was resolved in favor of Dover.\nThe Delaware State League began play on July 8, 1889, as a crowd of 600 was on hand to see Dover defeat Wilmington in the league opener. Camden began play under manager J.R. Richardson.\nAfter beginning play two weeks earlier, the Delaware State League permanently folded on July 25, 1889. The league's demise began when the Smyrna franchise reportedly couldn’t compete with other teams in player salaries and folded, with the team in last place. Within two weeks of Smyrna folding, the entire league folded. Camden had a 3–6 record when the league permanently folded. The league records and standings on the folding date of July 25, 1889, were: Dover (8–2), Milford (6–5), Wilmington (5–4) Camden (3–6) and Smyrna (1–6). Camden finished 4.5 games behind first place Dover in the final league standings.\nCamden, Delaware has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe name of the 1889 Camden minor league home ballpark is unknown."

In addition to women’s ice hockey, men’s swimming, cross country, along with men’s and women’s wrestling were casualties of this decision.\nThe program would return to varsity status for the 2018-19 Atlantic University Sport season. With an official introduction taking place on October 12, 2018, including a jersey ceremony held at Long Hall, in the Richard J. Currie Center, the captains for the new era of Reds hockey were also announced. Sydney DesRochers, a native of Woodstock, New Brunswick was named Team Captain, while Hayley Hallihan and Jennifer Bell, both from Miramichi, New Brunswick, were named assistant captains. Paige Grenier, from Olds, Alberta, became the first Red, extended an offer by head coach Sarah Hilworth, late in the summer of 2017. Ashley Stratton, from Mount Pearl, Newfoundland, became the first Atlantic Canadian recruited to the Reds, having won the Atlantic Challenge Cup in 2015.\nInaugural season.\nThe Reds first game, which was also their Atlantic University Sport season opener took place versus the Mount Allison Mounties on October 13, 2018. The game was the Reds first women's ice hockey game since an 8-1 loss to Mount Allison in the AUS Quarterfinals on February 22, 2008. As a side note, it was also the Reds first home opener since October 27, 2007. Jennifer Bell scored unassisted, 21 seconds into the second period, on Mounties goaltender Kaitlin Mowbray, capitalizing on a power play for the first goal of the new era. The game would go into double overtime, with Mounties skater Maddy Koughan scoring the game-winning tally. Of note, Kendra Woodland would be recognized as the Second Star of the Game, recording 32 saves.\nWoodland would emerge among the team's star players in the landmark season. Participating in 23 regular season games, she would capture a trio of honours, including the Atlantic University Sport Rookie of the Year, First Team All-Star honours, plus a spot on the AUS All-Rookie Team. Winning nine games, including three shutouts, she paced all goaltenders in conference play with a sparkling .945 save percentage, ranking eighth overall in U Sports play.\nStatistically, Tamina Kehler would finish as the Reds leading scorer, amassing 16 points, on the strength of 10 assists.

        "text": "Jordan Mackenzie Thompson (born May 5, 1997) is an American volleyball player for the United States women's national volleyball team and Turkish Women's Volleyball League team VakıfBank Istanbul. Thompson played collegiate volleyball with the University of Cincinnati Bearcats from 2015 to 2019. Thompson won gold with the national team at the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\nEarly life.\nThompson was born in Edina, Minnesota, to parents Tyrone Doleman and Mary Thompson. Her father also had an athletic career, as he played basketball at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, with the Harlem Globetrotters and eight years professionally overseas. Her uncle was Pro Football Hall of Famer Chris Doleman.\nThompson initially played basketball in middle school, but became frustrated with it and decided to try volleyball. After just two years of club volleyball, she got her first NCAA Division I scholarship offer.\nShe attended Edina High School where she was a four-year letterwinner, won two conference championships (2011, 2012) and led the team in blocks and kills during her senior season. She first played club volleyball at Club 43, but then transferred to Northern Lights, leading them to an AAU 17 Open title.\nCareer.\nCincinnati.\nThompson played college volleyball for Cincinnati, where she was the a three time unanimous American Athletic Conference player of the year and a two time AVCA All-American, garnering first-team honors as well as North Region Player of the Year in her redshirt senior season in 2019. In a win over Connecticut on Nov. 3, 2019, she had 50 kills in the match which is the most kills ever in a NCAA Division I match since the rally-scoring era began.\nThompson's volleyball career almost ended before she could finish out her college career when she suffered a UCL injury in her elbow during practice. She successfully underwent Tommy John surgery and recovered from her injury, returning to play after taking a redshirt season in 2017.\nIn her final season, she led Cincinnati to the 2019 NCAA Division I women's volleyball tournament Sweet Sixteen round, where they lost in a close five set match to Penn State. It was the first time any school from the American Athletic Conference made it into the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA tournament. She finished her collegiate career ranked seventh all-time in career kills in NCAA history and led the nation in kills, points, kills per set and points per set. She is the all-time leader in career kills at Cincinnati.\nProfessional clubs.\nThompson signed her first professional volleyball contract in 2019 began when she played for Turkish club Fenerbahçe. She then signed with Eczacıbaşı VitrA, another club from Turkey, for the 2020–2021 season. She was named best outside hitter in the 2020 Turkish Super Cup, helping Eczacıbaşı VitrA to the Turkish League Title. Although she was to play another season with Eczacıbaşı VitrA in 2021–2022, she parted ways with the team by mutual agreement in the early stages of the season. Thompson returned to the United States to continue treatment for the ankle injury she sustained during the 2020 Olympics.\nIn June 2022, Italian Serie A1 team Vero Volley Milano announced that Thompson would join the team for the 2022–2023 season.\nDuring the 2023 northern hemisphere summer, Jordan was signed to VakıfBankSporKulübü / VakıfBank Istanbul.\nUSA National Team.\nThompson's first major tournament play with the USA National Team came in 2019 during the 2020 Summer Olympics qualifier tournament, where she helped Team USA qualify for the Olympics. She was one of just three players on Team USA's qualifying roster with collegiate eligibility, and was the only one of the three to see playing time.\nShe was chosen to represent USA at the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League, where she scored 33 points versus Brazil in the Finals Round pool play. USA would eventually win the gold medal. After a one-year delay due to the 2020 Nations League being cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she was selected to again represent USA at the 2021 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League in May 2021. She had a match high 17 points in USA's sweep of Thailand. USA won the gold medal for the third year in a row after defeating Brazil, 3 sets to 1.\nOn June 7, 2021, she was named to the 12-player Olympic roster for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. In a pool play match against China, Thompson led all players with 34 total points, helping team USA win 3–0 against the defending Olympic champions. After suffering an ankle injury in a pool match against Russia, she did not make an appearance for the remainder of the tournament. Despite Thompson's absence, USA would eventually win the gold medal, the first in program history, after defeating Brazil in straight sets.\nIn June 2022, Thompson returned to national team competition after recovering from her ankle injury sustained during the 2020 Olympic Games, when she played in the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League tournament. She had 15 points in a win vs. the Dominican Republic.\nThompson was expected to compete in the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship, but did not make the final roster at the last minute due to injury.\nPersonal life.\nThompson has said she is a Christian. She married husband Blake Yager in 2018."

He was most recently the coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball team.\nCoaching career.\nAfter playing basketball at South Plains College, Adams transferred to Texas Tech, where he served as a student assistant to head coach Gerald Myers. After graduating from Texas Tech in 1979, Adams landed his first college coaching job at Clarendon College, where he stayed for two seasons and posted 46 victories. From 1983 to 1987 he served as the head coach at Wayland Baptist, where went 100–39 overall and led the Pioneers to the 1985 NAIA title game. Adams would move on to become the head coach at West Texas A&amp;M where he'd guide the Buffaloes to two NCAA Division II tournament appearances and compile an overall record of 108–40. In 1992, Adams accepted the Texas–Pan American job, where in five seasons he recorded a 44–90 record. \nAfter taking time away from coaching to become the owner of the Lubbock Cotton Kings hockey team, Adams would return to basketball coaching in 2004 when he was named the head coach at Howard College. While at Howard, Adams guided the team to 233 victories, as well as a program-record 36 wins in a single season and nine consecutive NJCAA regional tournament appearances highlighted by the 2010 NJCAA Championship and a roster featuring Jae Crowder. \nIn 2013, Adams joined Texas Tech's staff as the director of basketball operations under Tubby Smith, a position he'd hold for two seasons before joining Chris Beard as an assistant coach at Little Rock. In his one season as an assistant with the Trojans, Adams was part of the team's 2016 regular season and Sun Belt tournament titles, along with the school's upset win over fifth-seeded Purdue in the 2016 NCAA tournament. Adams would follow Beard back to Texas Tech as an assistant coach, and has been part of three NCAA tournament squads including national runner-up in 2019.\nAfter Beard's departure to Texas, Adams was promoted to the Red Raiders head coaching position on April 5, 2021.\nAdams led Texas Tech to a 27–10 record and the NCAA tournament in his first season at the helm, reaching the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Duke. In 2022–23, Tech finished the season with a 16–15 record and a ninth-place finish in the Big 12.\nOn March 5, 2023, Adams was suspended by the university over an alleged \"inappropriate, unacceptable, and racially insensitive comment\" that he had made to a player the previous week. In an attempt to make the player more receptive to his coaching, Adams \"referenced Bible verses about workers, teachers, parents, and slaves serving their masters.\"\nOn March 8, 2023, Adams resigned from Texas Tech."

Slovakian skier Petra Vlhová won the next event in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, to move 20 points ahead of Shiffrin with three events remaining. \nBut all of the final three events were cancelled. First, the slalom scheduled for Ofterschwang, Germany was canceled due to lack of snow and a bad forecast. Then the finals, scheduled for Saturday, 21 March in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. And finally, the one remaining slalom, scheduled in Åre, Sweden, for which Shiffrin had planned to return, was canceled due to COVID infections being detected among the skiers. Thus, the current leader in each discipline -- in this case, Vlhová -- automatically became the season winner of the crystal globe for that discipline.\nVlhová thus won the discipline title for the first time."

As was previously the case, the first run continued to be the speed discipline (with Super-G having the preference over downhill). The second run (the slalom) then started in reverse order of finish in the speed run, which allowed the slalom specialists (who tended to be significantly slower in the speed run) to tackle fresh snow as the first down the hill in the slalom run, while the speed specialists had to face the more challenging rutted snow at the end of the day, as the last skiers of the 30 who qualified for the second run. Instead, the second run was changed to start in the same order as the finish of the speed run, so that the leader after the speed run became the first to race on the fresh slalom course.\nBoth of the combined races held were won by Federica Brignone of Italy, who thus won the season championship (and the crystal globe, which was awarded by FIS jury vote despite the two cancellations). At this time, combined races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2020 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (but were not held due to the pandemic)."

        "text": "The women's parallel competition in the 2020 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup was contested as a World Cup discipline separate from slalom for the first time in 2020. Prior to the season, FIS decided to combine parallel skiing events (including all of parallel giant slalom, parallel slalom, and city events (parallel slaloms held on courses built within cities)) into a new discipline, joining the existing disciplines of downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and Alpine combined. The discipline winner would receive a small crystal globe, similar to the other disciplines. However, at the same time, FIS decided to drop the city events to reduce the amount of travel required during the World Cup season, planning to replace them with more parallel events at regular venues.\nThe parallel format was also changed to make the race more TV-friendly. Parallel races now began with one classic qualification run to determine the top 32, who advanced to the elimination phase of the main competition. The round of 32 used the existing run and re-run format, so that each competitor got to start from each side, but from the round of 16 forward, there was only one run per race and a direct knockout system—the loser of each race was gone. However, the new format immediately became controversial, as making two giant slalom courses equal in a single-run format proved impossible, and the first women's parallel giant slalom race suffered from \"the luck of the draw\" becoming determinative—17 of 20 winners came from the same course.\nUltimately, only two parallel events, the first a parallel slalom (PS) and the second a parallel giant slalom (PG), were held in the 2019–20 season. A third event, another parallel slalom, had been scheduled for Åre, Sweden, near the end of the season, but it was canceled to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the two parallel events that were held, Slovakian skier Petra Vlhová won the first event and also won the first-ever discipline championship and accompanying crystal globe for women in parallel. At this time, individual parallel races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2020 for Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy but were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

This was the first year that parallel was treated as a separate discipline; prior to the 2019–20 season, it had been a sub-element of the slalom discipline. The season had originally been scheduled to have 41 races (plus one mixed-team race at the World Cup finals), but 11 races that had originally been scheduled (and the mixed-team race) were canceled during the season, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed below.\nAs a side note, in a preseason vote FIS voted to change its official designation in the English language (but not in French or German) for female competitors from \"Ladies\" to \"Women\". All new FIS documents in English will immediately begin to use the new terminology.\nThree-time defending champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States had established a significant lead when her father Jeff suffered what proved to be a fatal head injury at the start of February, and Shiffrin missed the remainder of the season. After her departure, the two skiers closest to her in the overall standings, Federica Brignone of Italy and Petra Vlhová of Slovakia, competed in every event remaining in the season, regardless of the discipline, in an attempt to pass Shiffrin.\nBrignone grabbed the lead when she won the Alpine combined race in Crans Montana on 23 February and Vlhová, who had been second-fastest in the Super-G leg, straddled a gate in the slalom and didn't score any points. After just one more race six days later, the season was terminated; all of the final ten events were canceled due to a combination of bad weather for the first three and the COVID-19 pandemic for the remainder. As a result, Brignone became the first Italian woman ever to win the women's overall World Cup championship and the crystal globe that comes with it."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season was the 72nd season of play for the program and the 21st season in the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison and were coached by Tony Granato, in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Wisconsin's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nWisconsin entered the season having to rely on an entirely new troop of goaltenders, having lost all of their netminders from the year before. That wasn't an unfortunate circumstance as the Badgers had been one of the worst teams in the nation in terms of goals allowed. Senior transfer Robbie Beydoun was the first goalie to start for the team and Wisconsin started well, winning four of their first six games (all against ranked teams). After getting embarrassed by Arizona State in late November, Tony Granato began rotating his starting goalies and the team responded by handing #1 Minnesota their first loss of the season. With the team beginning to fire on all cylinders, Cole Caufield came into his own and rocketed up the national scoring standings. Caufield's goal-scoring helped the Badgers win 13 out of 16 games and finish atop the Big Ten by .002. The drastic turnaround was the first time a team had gone from worst to first in any conference standings since Maine in 1995 (though that included 14 forfeited games).\nAs the top seed, Wisconsin received a bye into the Big Ten semifinals but, when they hit the ice, the team appeared to have lost some its steam. The Badgers had to twice recover from Penn State leads in the third period before dominating in the overtime session. The championship game versus Minnesota saw more loose play and the Gophers scored four goals in the second period to take a 4-goal edge. The Badgers tried to come back in the final frame, scoring three times but an empty-net goal sealed their defeat.\nDespite the championship loss, Wisconsin was ranked 4th by the NCAA selection committee and given the top spot for the East Region in the NCAA Tournament. The Badgers opened against Bemidji State and for the third consecutive game they got off to a slow start. The Beavers scored twice in the first, including a goal with less than 20 seconds remaining. After Wisconsin cut the lead in half, BSU scored two more before the end of the second, including one off a terrible turnover by Beydoun. Cameron Rowe was in net to start the third but it didn't appear to make much difference as Bemidji State scored again to push their lead to four. Caufield scored twice in the third to try and spark a comeback but the deficit was too great and The Badgers' campaign ended on a 3–6 loss.\nBen Garrity sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Scheffler had achieved his first PGA Tour win at the WM Phoenix Open two months earlier, and after also winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational and WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play he entered the Masters as world number one.\nScheffler led by a record-tying five strokes after the second round, and held the lead from then on. His main challenger was Cameron Smith, who narrowed the lead to one stroke after the second hole of the final round. On the subsequent hole, Scheffler and Smith found themselves in the same tricky position, with Scheffler chipping in for a birdie, and Smith only managing a bogey, extending the lead to 3 strokes. Smith made a triple bogey on the 12th hole after his ball went into the water, leaving Scheffler relatively unchallenged for the rest of the round. \nEntering the final round 10 strokes back from Scheffler, Rory McIlroy shot a 8-under-par 64 to finish second, his best major finish since 2014. Much attention was given to Tiger Woods, who made his first PGA Tour start since the 2020 Masters after suffering severe injuries to his right leg and ankle in a February 2021 car accident. Woods made the cut and finished the tournament 47th, visibly limping for much of the last two rounds. Defending champion Hideki Matsuyama finished tied for 14th.\nThere was no winner of the Silver Cup (prize for low amateur), as no amateur made the cut. This year's purse was increased over thirty percent to $15 million, with a winner's share of $2.7 million.\nField.\nParticipation in the Masters Tournament is by invitation only, and the tournament has the smallest field of the major championships.

Beginning with a chip-in for birdie at the fifth, however, Smith went eight-under-par over a span of 14 holes. At the par-3 16th, Smith hit his tee shot to five feet and made the putt to get to six-under for the round before another double-bogey on the 18th dropped him back to four-under and a round of 68.\nScottie Scheffler, playing his first tournament as World No. 1, did not make a bogey until the 18th hole in a 3-under-par round of 69. He was in a group tied for third place that also included past champions Dustin Johnson and Danny Willett, as well as Joaquín Niemann, who holed out for an eagle on the par-4 ninth hole.\nHarold Varner III, in his Masters debut, went four-under-par in a 4-hole stretch from the 13th to the 16th hole, including a near albatross from the pine straw at the 13th. He finished with a one-under-par 71.\nTiger Woods was playing in his first tournament since the 2020 Masters and opened with a one-under-par 71, tied for 10th place after 18 holes. Defending champion Hideki Matsuyama shot an even-par 72.\nOvernight rain meant that the start was delayed by 30 minutes, with the first players teeing off at 8:30 a.m. local time.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 8, 2022\"\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler added a five-under-par round of 67 to his first round 69, for an aggregate score of 136, 8-under-par. Four players, including first-round leader Im Sung-jae and defending champion Hideki Matsuyama, were in second place. Scheffler's five-stroke lead tied the 36-hole tournament record, with 4 of the 5 previous record holders going on to win.\nTiger Woods shot a 74, and had an aggregate score of 145, one-over-par, tying him for 19th place nine strokes behind the leader. Stewart Cink made a hole-in-one at the par-3 16th hole.\n52 players made the cut of 148, 4-over-par. None of the six amateurs made the cut.

On the par-3 12th hole, Scheffler hit his tee shot into the bunker in front of the green and had his second roll over the green, leading to a bogey. After an up-and-down for birdie on the par-5 13th, his approach on the 14th spun off the green and led to another bogey. He found the green on the par-5 15th hole in three shots but three-putted for his third bogey over his last four holes.\nWith his lead now cut to just three shots, Scheffler played his approach on the 17th to five feet and made the birdie to get back to 10-under. At the 18th, he was forced to take a drop from underneath a tree after a drive well to the left, but was able to hit his third shot from the pine straw over the green and salvage a bogey to finish at nine-under following a round of 71.\nCameron Smith began the round six shots behind but went five-under from the sixth to 15th holes. Despite a bogey at the par-3 16th after failing to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker, Smith shot a four-under 68, the best round of the day by two shots, to finish at six-under, three behind Scheffler.\nFirst-round leader Im Sung-jae double-bogeyed his first hole and was four-over through six holes, but played the remainder of his round in five-under to finish with a 71 and jump up to solo third place at four-under. 2011 champion Charl Schwartzel, playing in the final group with Scheffler, holed out from the fairway on the 10th for an eagle to get within three of the lead but made four bogeys over his final eight holes to drop back to two-under, tied for fourth with Shane Lowry.\nFive-time champion Tiger Woods had four three-putts and a four-putt, his first in this tournament since 2005, in a six-over round of 78, the worst score of his career at the Masters.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 10, 2022\"\nSummary.\nScottie Scheffler shot a one-under round of 71 to win his first Masters and major championship by three shots. \nScheffler began the final round with a three-shot lead but saw his advantage cut to one after Cameron Smith birdied his first two holes. Both players missed their drives left on the par-4 third hole and came up short on their second shots. Scheffler, playing first, hit a low shot that rolled into the hole for a birdie. Smith chipped past the hole and missed his par putt to fall back to three behind. Smith also bogeyed the par-3 fourth from the front greenside bunker. They both birdied the seventh after close approaches and Scheffler made the turn with a four-shot lead at 11-under.\nOn the 10th, Smith hooked his drive well left and was forced to pitch back out into the fairway, then missed a close putt for par. Scheffler, meanwhile, was in the middle of the fairway off the tee but hit his approach off the green to the left and failed to get up-and down. When Smith birdied the 11th hole by making a 15-foot putt, only the second birdie on the hole during the round, he cut the deficit to three heading to the 12th.\nSmith's approach on the par-3 12th came up short and landed in Rae's Creek. Taking a drop and now playing his third shot, he hit over the green and ended up with a triple-bogey to fall out of contention. Scheffler also missed the green with his tee shot but was able to scramble and save par. After laying up on the par-5 13th and making par, Scheffler knocked his approach on 14 to five feet and made another birdie to get to 11-under. He also got up-and-down from over the green on the par-5 15th to increase his lead to five.\nRory McIlroy began the round 10 shots behind Scheffler before making four birdies on his front-nine. He then chipped in for birdie from over the green on the 10th, eagled the par-5 13th, and holed a shot from a greenside bunker on the 18th to shoot 64 (−8), tying a Masters record for the lowest final-round score. He finished at seven-under and moved up to solo second place, his best finish at the Masters. McIlroy shot the only bogey-free round of any player during the tournament in his final round.\nWith a five-shot lead playing 18th, Scheffler missed a birdie putt from the top shelf of the green, then missed two short putts and tapped in for double-bogey to finish at 10-under, three ahead of McIlroy. Smith recovered from another bogey on the 14th with two straight birdies on the 15th and 16th to finish at five-under and in a tie for third with Shane Lowry.\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nAftermath.\nReaction from Scheffler.\nAs is traditional, Scheffler was interviewed in Butler Cabin, where he discussed his victory:"

The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAfter two good seasons, Cornell's third year back on the ice faced an uphill climb from the beginning. The team lost three of its stalwart players (Finn, Thornton and Wight) and would face a difficult task in replacing their talents. When the team was forming in early January, the team was further hamstring by the ineligibility of several potential replacement players. Coach Bawlf had no difficulty in finding students willing to play but the lack in quality led to grim projections for the season from the outset. Three returning players, Brockway, MacDonald and Tone, were known quantities for the Big Red but the rest of the potential lineup wasn't able to distinguish itself.\nDespite concerns, Cornell opened their season well, losing to Dartmouth in overtime. The teams remained tied after three 12-minute periods but Dartmouth pulled away in overtime, scoring twice in the first 5-minute extra session. After a 0–0 tie against Clarkson the following week, The Big Red were handed their second loss of the season by MAC. Even will the poor start, Cornell was able to show that their defense was at least up to par.\nAfter taking a week off for the semester break, the club returned with a game against Columbia. The forward roster was adjusted with Brockway going back to wing, where he had played last year, and Burnett and Davidson inserted into the starting lineup. Despite the changes, Cornell was unable to score and lost 0–1. A week later they hit the road and faced powerhouse Harvard. Though they fell 0–6, the Crimson were expected to be leagues ahead of the Big Red. The final game of the year came at Pennsylvania and Cornell was still unable to get a win, ending with a 2–2 tie after three extra periods.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2019 \"League of Legends\" World Championship Final was a \"League of Legends\" (\"LoL\") esports series between FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) and G2 Esports on 10 November 2019 at AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France. It marked the ninth final of a \"LoL\" World Championship and the first time either of the teams had reached the world finals. It was the first time FPX had reached Worlds. FPX were one of three Chinese representatives from the \"League of Legends\" Pro League at the 2019 Worlds, the others being Royal Never Give Up and Invictus Gaming, the victors of the previous Worlds. G2 Esports were one of three European representatives from the \"League of Legends\" European Championship alongside Fnatic and Splyce.\nThe series was a best of five and was played in front of over 15,000 spectators, with more than 40 million concurrent live stream viewers and a total of over 100 million total viewers. The series ended 3–0 in favour of FPX after a dominating performance from all their players.\nFPX's jungler Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang earned the title of Most Valuable Player. The series marked the first international victory for FPX, though they would go on to fail to qualify for the 2020 World Championship.\nBackground.\n\"League of Legends\" is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Riot Games. Each year, Riot hosts a World Championship (Worlds) featuring the most successful teams globally throughout the year-long season. The 2019 Worlds, the ninth edition of the World Championship, as with its predecessors, was played on the map \"Summoner's Rift\", a play-field featuring three lanes defined by their locationtop, middle, and bottomand two jungle quadrants, mirrored diagonally down a neutral zone known as the river. Summoner's Rift is played by ten players, five per team, through an isometric perspective as players control characters, known as \"champions\", split between five roles respective on their location on the map: top, jungle, middle, attack damage carry, and support. The latter two are both played in the bottom lane. The two teams are referred to as red and blue. The red team spawns in the top right and the blue team spawns in the bottom left.\nIn professional play, players choose their champions during champion select. This consists of four phases: banning phase and picking phase, both of which occur twice. The blue team starts, banning one champion at their discretion. This is then interchanged between the teams until six total champions have been banned, three per team. Blue side then picks their first champion, followed by red side selecting two champions before blue side completes the first phase of picking and banning by also locking in two champions. The teams then begin the second banning phase, starting with red side. The teams interchange until four additional champions have been banned, for a total of ten. Red side also initiates the second picking phase by selecting one champion. Blue side then responds by picking two champions before red side finalises the process by locking in the final champion.\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to destroy the enemy team's Nexus. This is accomplished through leveling up and purchasing items with gold, the in-game currency. In the lanes there are turrets and inhibitors, defensive objectives for the opposing team to destroy, as well as a constant stream of minions that can be killed for gold and experience. Similarly, the jungle contains monsters that reward gold and experience upon defeating them. In the river, there are two major neutral objectives. The Rift Herald spawns on the top side of the river and on death, rewards the team with an active item that respawns the Rift Herald, dealing significant damage to the opposing team's defensive structures. At 20 minutes in, the Rift Herald disappears and is replaced by Baron Nashor. Baron Nashor provides the team that kills it with substantial buffs. On the bottom side of the map, dragons spawn. Random elemental dragons that provide small permanent buffs to the acquiring team continue to spawn until 35 minutes in, at which point the Elder Dragon will spawn that upon being slain, provides the team with a powerful temporary buff. Gold and experience points are also obtained through killing these neutral monsters.\nRoute to the final.\nG2 Esports.\nG2 Esports were dominant throughout the entirety of 2019, both domestically and internationally. In their domestic region, the \"League of Legends\" European Championship (LEC), they would triumph over Origen to win the 2019 Spring Split. The match was a five game series and occurred in the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands on 13 April 2019 with an attending audience of 15,000, along with livestreams hosted through Twitch.tv and YouTube. G2 won the series 30 in under 75 minutes of combined game time. This set an LEC record, beating the former fastest five game series by over half an hour. G2 would also win game three, the final game, in a record 18 minutes 31 seconds. They would ultimately finish the Spring Split with a 135 record. G2's victory qualified them for the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI). An international tournament, they would need to compete against teams from other regions. After reaching the semi-finals, G2 beat the \"League of Legends\" Champions Korea (LCK) representative SKT T1, a team considered a favourite of the tournament, to reach the finals. The North American League Championship Series representative Team Liquid would be G2's opponent after Team Liquid upset the Chinese \"League of Legends\" Pro League (LPL) representative Invictus Gaming to reach the finals. G2 beat Team Liquid 30 in a best of five. The series was the quickest international best of five in League of Legends history. This victory marked the first time a European team had won the event.\nAfter MSI, the LEC 2019 Summer Split commenced. Here, G2 would perform better than in the previous season, ending with a 153 record. The team would once again reach the finals, this time facing Fnatic in the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece on 8 September 2019. The series would become one of the most viewed esports events of all time, peaking at 850,000 livestream viewers. This finals would prove more difficult for G2 than the Spring Split, with the first game going the way of Fnatic. The series would then ping-pong between the two teams until the scoreline was 22. In the final game, G2 would draft a team composition that would be strong in the early game, in order to gain a quick lead and snowball into an early victory. This would prove successful, and G2 would win the series win 32. This victory cemented G2 as the European first seed for the 2019 \"League of Legends\" World Championship and marked their fourth Worlds appearance.\nG2 was seeded into Group A for Worlds alongside Griffin, Cloud9, and Hong Kong Attitude. G2 remained undefeated throughout the group stage until their final game where they would lose against Griffin. This resulting in a tied overall record of 51 for G2 and Griffin and in determining the winner of the group, G2 lost the tie-breaker, finishing second in the group. Having progressed into the knockout stage, G2 defeated Damwon Gaming, a representative from the LCK, in the quarterfinals and SKT T1 in the semifinals to reach the 2019 \"League of Legends\" World Championship Final.\nFunPlus Phoenix.\nAfter disappointing performances from FunPlus Phoenix (FPX) in their domestic region, the \"League of Legends\" Pro League, in 2018, where they ended with records of 910 and 811 in the Spring and Summer Splits respectively, the team saw major roster changes, as Kim \"Doinb\" Tae-sang replaced the midlaner and Gao \"Tian\" Tian-Liang, previously of Suning, joined as the jungler. These changes would prove successful as they would begin 2019 by achieving a third-place finish in the Spring Split. This split proved useful for building synergies between the team's players. For instance, Doinb developed a playstyle that involved consistently leaving his own lane to roam the map accompanied with Tian and Liu \"Crisp\" Qing-Song, the support, to gank opposing lanes with a significant numbers advantage.\nIn the Summer Split, FPX displayed dominance, losing only one series all split to Invictus Gaming, the victors of the 2018 \"League of Legends\" World Championship. The team would face off against Bilibili Gaming in the semi-finals, losing the first game but ending the series 31. The same would occur in the finals against Royal Never Give Up, which they would similarly win 31 to claim the 2019 Summer Split title. This victory made FPX the first seed for China at the World Championships and marked their first appearance at the World Championship.\nFPX was seeded into Group B for Worlds, alongside J Team, GAM Esports, and Splyce, the lattermost winning their respective play-ins bracket. FPX began their Worlds stint by losing to J Team on the first day of groups, however they would then win three games in a row before losing to Splyce. After this loss, they would win one more game before competing in a tiebreaker against Splyce as they had both ended groups with a 42 record. FPX would win this game, finishing first in the group. Having advanced from groups into the knockout stage, FPX continued to use their signature playstyle and would trump Fnatic in the quarterfinals and Invictus Gaming in the semifinals to reach the finals against G2.\nBackground and pre-series.\nG2 Esports were alongside Fnatic in representing the LEC and FPX were alongside Royal Never Give Up and Invictus Gaming, the victors of the previous Worlds, in representing the LPL. This series marked the first time either team had reached the World Finals, despite G2 having made three appearances in past World Championships. The Finals were a best of five series, with the first team to win a total of three games being crowned the champions.\nThe series was held on 10 November 2019 at AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France for 15,000 spectators. The event was livestreamed via Twitch.tv and YouTube in multiple languages, as well as through the official \"LoL Esports\" website. Globally, Riot reported that the finals alone reached 44 million concurrent online viewers at its peak, with an estimated total of over 100 million total viewers over the course of the series. This equated to an average minute audience of 21.8 million. Prior to the commencement of the games, Riot held an opening ceremony featuring performances from musical artists that had collaborated with \"League of Legends\" throughout the year. This began at 13:00 local time (). The ceremony began with Valerie Broussard performing \"Awaken\", a song released in conjunction with Riot at the start of 2019 to celebrate the beginning of the game's ninth season. This was immediately followed by True Damage, a fictional hip-hop group akin to that of K/DA, featuring Becky G, Keke Palmer, Jeon So-yeon of the K-pop girl group G-Idle, Duckwrth, and Thutmose, performing \"GIANTS\". Finally, the 2019 World Championship promotion song \"Phoenix\" was performed by Cailin Russo and Chrissy Costanza to conclude the opening ceremony. Throughout the ceremony, holographic projections were cast onto the stage to visualise \"League of Legends\" characters in the real world.\nThe English streams were cast by Chris \"PapaSmithy\" Smith, Trevor \"Quickshot\" Henry, and Sam \"Kobe\" Hartman-Kenzler.\nTeam line-ups.\nNeither team made any line-up changes going into the finals. FunPlus Phoenix's head coach was Chen \"WarHorse\" Ju-Chih and G2 Esports' head coach was Fabian \"GrabbZ\" Lohmann.\nSeries.\nGame 1.\nThe champion selection phase for the first game commenced shortly after the conclusion of the opening ceremony. FPX were on blue side which gave them the opportunity to ban and pick the first champions of the game. In the first banning phase, FPX opted to ban Syndra, Gragas, and Kai'Sa, while G2 Esports banned Pantheon, a champion that had been banned in every previous game throughout the World Championship; Qiyana; and Xayah. Following the first ban phase, FPX first picked Nautilus, a champion the casters described as a \"flex pick\", or a champion capable of being played in multiple positions. It was ultimately played by Doinb, their midlaner. G2 Esports responded by locking in Varus for Perkz and Ryze for Wunder. For the remaining picks of the first pick phase, FPX chose Lee Sin for Tian and Sivir for LWX, and G2 chose Tahm Kench for Mikyx as their final pick. Before the second pick phase, G2 banned Blitzcrank and Braum and FPX banned and Rek'Sai and Olaf. As G2 were on red side, they got the first pick of the second pick phase, selecting Elise for Jankos. This was followed by Gangplank and Thresh from FPX, for GimGoon and Crisp, respectively, and with G2's last pick, they chose Pyke for Caps.\nUpon the players loading into the game, it was paused immediately due to technical problems for several minutes. The teams opted to \"split\" the map, meaning both junglers began in the opposing team's jungle. After three minutes of play, the first blood of the match went the way of FPX after GimGoon, assisted by Tian and Doinb, successfully executed a tower dive against Wunder. A few minutes later, Tian took the first drake of the game. Eleven minutes in, the fight involving all ten players erupted when Doinb and Jankos met in the top side river. Crisp was brought very low but avoided death by using a stopwatch (a consumable item that temporarily makes the user invulnerable) when Caps used his ultimate ability. Ultimately, no member of either team died. One minute later Perkz was caught out in the top lane and was killed by LWX. Tian furthered his team's lead in the 14th minute by taking the second drake of the game, though G2 Esports traded it for the Rift Herald as compensation, which they then used to destroy the first tower for additional gold.\nThe game ended in just under 41 minutes.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 ended in 25:38 minutes, with a final kill scoreline of 20-4, in favour of FPX.\nGame 3.\nG2 took first blood in the third game, but lost in 30:22. FPX would claim the Summoner's Cup in their first World's appearance.\nPost-series.\nThe tournament had a base prize pool of US$2.225 million. Of this, the winners, FunPlus Phoenix, received 37.5% ($834,375) of the pool. For coming second, G2 was rewarded 13.5% ($300,375). Alongside this, the prize pool is increased through a percentage of the commissions from the year's promotional \"Championship\" skina form of virtual cosmetic that modifies the look of the player's champion. Championship skins are given to champions that are seen consistently in the professional leagues and tournaments that year. 2019's Championship skin was given to Ryze, who had a 95.2% presence at the 2019 Mid-Season Invitational. As with previous world champions, FPX worked directly with Riot's visual department to release skins for their chosen champions, with one per player. The skins imitate the team's design, hence FPX's skins include \"a fiery motif, with bird-like masks\". The chosen champions were Gangplank, picked by GimGoon; Lee Sin, picked by Tian; Malphite, picked by Doinb; Vayne, picked by LWX; and Thresh, picked by Crisp. The profits of these skins go in part to the players and their team, as well as to their respective professional league.\nIn the following season, FPX would fail to qualify for the 2020 \"League of Legends\" World Championship after an inconsistent year. Despite accruing 30 championship points in the LPL Spring Split from finishing third, the team was unable to perform in the Summer Split and were knocked out of contention by Invictus Gaming in the loser's bracket qualifier. In their stead, Top Esports, JD Gaming, LGD Gaming, and Suning represented the Chinese region. G2 Esports would qualify and attend the next year's Worlds representing Europe alongside Fnatic, Rogue, and MAD Lions. G2 would ultimately place third, losing to DAMWON Gaming in the semi-finals. DAMWON Gaming would go on to win the tournament."

Three teams will participate across two matches, with the winner of the Asian Cup semi-final progressing to play the highest ranked participating team Hong Kong in the Asian Cup final. The winner of the final will advance to a Asia/Pacific play-off match against the winner of , Tonga (Oceania 2).\nOriginally planned for May 2021, the Championship was postponed due to health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had been pushed back multiple more times to allow ample time for teams to participate safely owing COVID-19. This also meant multiple restructures of the competition from a round-robin format home and away to just a single round of fixtures played out of a neutral venue.\nIn April 2022, the format changed once again, following the withdrawal of Hong Kong, setting up a 2-match play-off between South Korea and Malaysia. However, on 29 April, Asia Rugby confirmed the final format for the competition which included Hong Kong back in the competition.\nEntrants.\nThree teams will compete during for the Asian qualifiers for the 2023 Rugby World Cup, with Japan the only team thus far qualified from the Region."

        "text": "William Joyce (born December 29, 1957) is a Canadian retired ice hockey right wing who was the NCAA Scoring Champion in 1979–80.\nCareer.\nJoyce was a member of the inaugural recruiting class for Northern Michigan University when the ice hockey team was promoted to varsity status. He finished second on the team in scoring as a freshman and helped the team to a winning record in their first season. The program joined the CCHA beginning in 1977 and the team was good enough to finish in the top half of the conference. Joyce continued to finish second in team scoring behind Mike Mielke in each of this first three seasons. As a senior, Joyce's scoring exploded and he led the nation with 96 points, besting his previous record by nearly 40 points. Joyce led the Wildcats to a first place finish in the CCHA as well as the program's first conference championship and NCAA tournament appearance. Unfortunately, because the CCHA was still seen as a lesser conference, Joyce was not named an All-American (no players for the CCHA received that honor in 1980). Northern Michigan surprised many in college hockey by winning their first two tournament games to make the 1980 championship game. Joyce scored the first goal for the Wildcats in the title tilt but it came after they were already behind 0–4 and didn't change the final outcome.\nAfter graduating, Joyce began his professional career with a short appearance in 1981 before finding a home with the Toledo Goaldiggers in 1982. He finished second on the team with 112 points and helped the club win both the regular season title and the Turner Cup. Joyce remained with the team for another two and half years, helping them to a second championship in 1983, and finished his career out with the Flint Generals in 1985.\nJoyce was inducted into the Northern Michigan Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998 and remains the team's All-Time leading scorer as of 2021. When the CCHA ceased operations after the 2013 season, Joyce was named to the All-Time CCHA Second Team, the only Wildcat to make an appearance."

FMT is responsible for the organization of the Monte-Carlo Masters every year in April, as well as the Davis Cup matches. The FMT uses the same ranking system as the French Tennis Federation.\nHistory.\nThe Monegasque Lawn Tennis Federation was established on May 21, 1927. The first president was British Consul Major William G.Henley and vice-president Emile Riey. Its objective is to support and co-ordinate tennis clubs in the Principality and encourage relations with foreign federations and clubs.\nThe Federation is affiliated with the International Tennis Federation since a decision of its general assembly of March 16, 1928. Initially, its affiliation had little chance of succeeding because the Principality had only one club the courts of which were located in French territory. Finally, the request was accepted on declaration of the Monegasque representative according to which there would be three clubs comprising 15 courts in addition to those located in Saint-Roman.\nOrganization.\nThe FMT brings together four clubs: the Monte-Carlo Country Club, the Monte-Carlo Tennis Club, the International Lawn Tennis Club of Monaco and the Association Sportive de la Sûreté Publique.\nThe Monte-Carlo Country Club (M.C.C.C.) site has 23 clay courts, 2 indoor courts and 2 hard courts. The facilities offered by the club are used by world famous players such as Novak Djokovic, Milos Raonic, Tomáš Berdych, Marin Čilić, Alexander Zverev, Grigor Dimitrov, David Goffin, Daniil Medvedev, Stéfanos Tsitsipás, Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitová and Svetlana Kuznetsova.\nBaroness Elizabeth-Ann de Massy was the president of FMT since 1992 till her death in June 2020.

Teams are seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. The #1 seed will play the lowest remaining seed in the semifinals.\nDue to the possibility of an unbalanced number of league matches played this year, conference wins (NOT win percentage), will be the first criteria looked at to determine MPSF Tournament seeding.

        "text": "The 2021–22 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team represented the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was coached by Hubert Davis, in his first season as UNC's head coach after the retirement of longtime coach Roy Williams. The Tar Heels played their home games at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nThey finished the season 29–10 overall and 15–5 in ACC play to finish in a tie for second place. As the third seed in the ACC tournament, they defeated sixth seed Virginia in the Quarterfinals before losing to seventh seed and eventual champions Virginia Tech in the Semifinals. They earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and were the eighth seed in the East Region. In the Final Four, Carolina beat Duke in the first and only rivalry meeting in the NCAA tournament. This game would be the final game of Coach K's career. In the National Championship game they lost to Kansas to end their run despite leading by as many as 16 before halftime.\nPrevious season.\nThe Tar Heels finished the 2020–21 season 18–11, 10–6 in ACC play to finish in a tie for fifth place. On February 27, 2021, head coach Roy Williams won his 900th career game in a win over Florida State, becoming the 5th and fastest Division 1 men's head coach to reach the milestone. On March 6, 2021, UNC completed a season sweep over rival Duke in a 91–73 win. Following the win, Roy Williams kissed the Smith Center court, causing speculation of possible retirement. Williams later said it was because of the team's 10–1 home record. As the No. 6 seed in the ACC tournament, they defeated Notre Dame and Virginia Tech, before losing to Florida State in the semifinals. The Virginia Tech win would end up as Williams' 903rd and last win as a coach. North Carolina received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 8 seed and would lose in the first round to 9th-seeded Wisconsin in what would be Roy Williams' last game. Following the season, Roy Williams announced he would retire after 18 years as head coach of North Carolina.\nOffseason.\nOn April 1, 2021, Roy Williams announced his retirement. Williams stated that he didn't feel like he was the \"right man for the job anymore\". ESPN's Seth Greenberg suspected the changing culture of college basketball and \"constantly re-recruiting your players, as opposed to mentoring them\" played a part in Williams' decision. Following the announcement, athletic director Bubba Cunningham and chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz started the process of searching for the next head coach. CBS Sports' Matt Norlander said \"The best job in college basketball just opened\". On April 5, 2021, UNC hired former player and assistant coach Hubert Davis as the next head coach. The next day, Davis was formally introduced at an introductory press conference.\nRoster changes.\nFollowing UNC's loss to Wisconsin in the 2021 NCAA tournament, Sports Illustrated's Quierra Luck reported, \"Carolina will have some transfers; a considerably high number for UNC\" and Inside Carolina's Sherrell McMillan reported the offseason would be \"ominous\".\nThree days later, freshman center Walker Kessler announced he was entering the NCAA's transfer portal. Inside Carolina reported that Kessler's decision was a \"basketball decision only\". On April 12, 2021, Kessler announced that he would transfer to Auburn for the 2021-22 season.\nOn March 24, 2021, freshman forward/center Day'Ron Sharpe declared for the 2021 NBA draft. On April 6, 2021 sophomore Armando Bacot also declared for the NBA draft, citing his intentions to \"test the waters\". On June 21, 2021 Bacot formally withdrew from the NBA draft process, signaling his return to UNC for his junior season in a tweet.\nRedshirt junior Sterling Manley, walk-on senior Walker Miller, and senior forward Garrison Brooks all announced intentions to graduate and transfer. Brooks transferred to Mississippi State on April 15. On June 19, Miller announced he would be pursuing a graduate transfer at Monmouth University, and would be coached there by another former Tar Heel player in King Rice. Manley eventually pulled his name from the transfer portal and decided to turn professional. After graduation, guard Andrew Platek eventually put his name into the transfer portal, and enrolled at Siena College in his home state of New York.\nCoach Davis was active in the transfer portal to mitigate these losses. On April 10, 2021, Virginia transfer Justin McKoy chose the Tar Heels. He was followed on April 16 by Oklahoma forward Brady Manek. On July 8, 2021, the Tar Heels picked up another transfer when former Marquette forward Dawson Garcia, a Big East All-Freshman team selection for the 2020–2021 season, committed to the Tar Heels. His addition was made official on July 9, when the school issued a press release indicating his signing and arrival in Chapel Hill.\nRoster.\n Shaver, a member of North Carolina's 2022 recruiting class, enrolled a semester early due to the Tar Heels having an extra scholarship available. He will redshirt for the remainder of the 2021–22 season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=|ACC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament"

The tournament returned to its normal window of August, kicking-off on 14 August and concluding on 2 October.\nSponsorships.\nThe competition was operated by SANZAAR, a joint venture of the four countries' national unions, and known for sponsorship reasons as \"The Castle Rugby Championship\" in South Africa, \"The Fortinet Rugby Championship\" in New Zealand, \"The eToro Rugby Championship\" in Australia, and \"The Zurich Rugby Championship\" in Argentina.\nTravel disruptions.\nWith continued restrictions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the tournament was staged in Australia and New Zealand, with South Africa also hosting two games - their two matches against Argentina in the opening two rounds.\nOn 3 August, the original schedule was altered due to travel restrictions imposed in New Zealand, meaning the first and second tests between Australia and New Zealand (Bledisloe 2 &amp; 3) were reversed and rearranged, and New Zealand would play at Eden Park instead of Wellington Regional Stadium. The restrictions also meant that New Zealand would not host their tests against Argentina, and were eventually played in Australia.\nOn 24 August, it was announced that all games in Rounds 3–6 would be hosted in Queensland, Australia. This came after COVID restrictions in New Zealand meant South Africa (and Argentina who were already set to play the All Blacks at a neutral venue) were unable to travel to New Zealand.

For some of the law adaptions, they had previously been trialed at Super Rugby level in Australia and New Zealand; the goal-line drop out and the 50:22, whilst the others are new to help reduce injury risk at the breakdown. In addition, outside the World Rugby global law trials, this years Rugby Championship will also trial a 20-minute red card which like the goal-line drop out and 50:22, had been used in Australia and New Zealand respective Super Rugby tournaments.\nThe championship was won by New Zealand after the 19-17 win against South Africa on 25 September.\nFixtures.\nRound 1.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 2.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 4.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 6.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nSquads.\nNote: Ages, caps and clubs/franchises are of 14 August 2021 – the starting date of the tournament\nArgentina.\nOn 29 July, Argentina announced a 47-man roster for the 2021 Rugby Championship.

Hansen managed his 2,500th game on May 9, 2009, during Smithfield City Health Days. In 2009 he celebrated his 60th year with the team and 47 year as manager. In his 47 years of coaching the team, he only missed six games. Hansen passed away on January 21, 2010. In honor of his relentless and untiring service to the Smithfield Blue Sox the Richard V. Hansen Award has been awarded annually since 2010 to a person who has done all they could for the Blue Sox organization.\nA memorial to Nyals Bodine, Steven Smith, and Dale Anderson can also be found on the East side of the park near the Blue Sox dugout.\nIn 2021 the crows nest was renamed the \"Steven Smith Crows Nest\" in memory of Steven Smith.\nThe ballpark has also become known for its \"Lion Pups\". Starting in 1953 instead of serving hot dogs the food stand decided to serve corn dogs. Ruth S. Hansen, an avid member of Lions Clubs International and mother of Richard Hansen said \"We should call them Lion Pups.\" The name has stuck ever since. Originally a Lion Pup only cost 5 cents. They are traditional served with a secret sauce, many believe it to be a concoction of ketchup and mustard. The food stand, also known as the \"Lions stand\" and is sponsored by the Smithfield Lions Club."

Norway won its 15th gold medal on 18 February, thus breaking the record.\nThis should be seen in light of the ongoing medal inflation, e.g., from 16 gold medals in 1924 to 109 in 2022. However, Norway also holds the medal inflation-adjusted records: in 1936, Norwegian athletes won 41% of all events (7 out of 17), in 1928, 43% (6 out of 14).

Earlier, Heidi Weng and Anne Kjersti Kalvå also tested positive and had to miss the Olympics.\nHowever, six days before the 50 km race was to start, Krüger had negative tests and was allowed to participate. He then won the bronze medal in the race, which then had been shortened to 28 km caused by weather conditions.\nCurling.\nMen's tournament.\nNorway has qualified their men's team (five athletes), by finishing first in the round robin in the 2021 Olympic Qualification Event.\nNorway had a bye in draws 3, 7 and 11.\n\"Wednesday, 9 February, 20:05\"\n\"Thursday, 10 February, 14:05\"\n\"Friday, 11 February, 20:05\"\n\"Saturday, 12 February, 14:05\"\n\"Sunday, 13 February, 9:05\"\n\"Monday, 14 February, 14:05\"\n\"Tuesday, 15 February, 9:05\"\n\"Tuesday, 15 February, 20:05\"\n\"Thursday, 17 February, 9:05\"\nMixed doubles tournament.\nNorway has qualified their mixed doubles team (two athletes), by finishing in the top seven teams in the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship.\nNorway had a bye in draws 2, 6, 8 and 10.\n\"Wednesday, 2 February, 20:05\"\n\"Thursday, 3 February, 14:05\"\n\"Thursday, 3 February, 20:05\"\n\"Friday, 4 February, 8:35\"\n\"Saturday, 5 February, 9:05\"\n\"Saturday, 5 February, 20:05\"\n\"Sunday, 6 February, 14:05\"\n\"Sunday, 6 February, 20:05\"\n\"Monday, 7 February, 9:05\"\n\"Monday, 7 February, 20:05\"\n\"Tuesday, 8 February, 20:05\"\nFreestyle skiing.\nNorway qualified 4 men and 2 women.\nNordic combined.\nNorway qualified 5 athletes.\nSki jumping.\nNorway qualified 5 men and 3 women.

The CSB Blazers, on the other hand, are in their very first Finals appearance since joining the NCAA in 1998.\nIt was a nip and tuck affair and the Blazers leading most of the way of Game 1. Near the end of the game, San Sebastian took the lead for the first time, 64-61, thanks to Mark Macapagal and Paul Reguerra converting their free throws. However, Al Magpayo drew a three-point play off Macapagal to tie the game with 40 seconds remaining. Magpayo then gave an inbound pass to Mark Magsumbol then coasted on a game-winning layup to lift the Blazers past the Stags.\nDuplicating their sister school's feat, the Blazers masterfully beat the Stags in Game 2 from the start, capitalized from the poor free-throw shooting of the San Sebastian squad. With their deep bench, the Blazers easily took the half, 37-25, before speeding to a 16-point margin, 54-38. The Blazers then never looked back, capturing their first title since joining the league in 1998.\nJuniors' tournament.\nElimination round.\nThe Letran Squires finished the elimination round undefeated and advanced to the Finals outright, with the twice-to-beat advantage.\nFinals.\nOn Game 1, the Mapua Red Robins snapped Letran's 14-game winning streak to extend the series to a deciding Game 2.\nOn the deciding game, the Red Robins won the championship, sweeping the Finals against the Squires.\nThis would be the last championship by the Mapua Red Robins. The Mapua Technical High School was closed, and stopped competing in 2005. The Malayan High School of Science became Mapua's representative in the juniors' division, starting on 2008."

The Nittany Lions represented Pennsylvania State University and were coached by Guy Gadowsky, in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Penn State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nPenn State had a dreadful start to their season, losing their first five games while facing a murderers row of ranked teams. The team rebounded sharply in their sixth contest, scoring 9 goals and nearly doubling their season total to that point. After the Nittany Lions' first win of the year, the team played much better and slowly climbed back to respectability, winning nine of twelve and pulled themselves above .500 near the end of January. Just when it seemed like the team had turned a corner, their season was derailed by COVID-19. All of PSU's games were cancelled in February and the team didn't play again until the end of the regular season. The 34-day layoff hamstrung the team and it showed in their poor performance; despite outshooting Notre Dame in both games, the Nittany Lions lost both by a combined score of 3–12.\nBy losing an entire months-worth of games, Penn State couldn't overcome their bad start and the team's only path into the NCAA Tournament was by winning the Big Ten. They faced the same Fighting Irish team that had soundly beaten them a week earlier in the first round, but the game time appeared to have knocked the rust off of the Penn State and the Lions scored 5 consecutive goals to give themselves a solid 6–3 win. Their next game was against league-leading Wisconsin and Penn State showed no fear, overcoming an early deficit and outshooting the Badgers to take two separate leads in the game. Once the game got into overtime, the fast pace of regulation seemed to have caught up with PSU and they were overwhelmed by the Badgers, surrendering 10 shots in under 7 minutes and they could only watch as the nation's leading goal-scorer ended their season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

It determined the national champion for the 2013–14 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The game matched the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the UConn Huskies and was played on April 8, 2014, at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tennessee.\nUConn and Notre Dame both entered the game unbeaten, making this the first championship game to be held between two undefeated teams. Both teams came in with talented rosters; eight of the game's ten starting players were eventually drafted in a WNBA draft. UConn overpowered Notre Dame to win the game by 21 points and break the record with their ninth NCAA Division I championship.\nParticipants.\nThe championship game, described as a \"dream matchup\" by UConn head coach Geno Auriemma, matched the Notre Dame Fighting Irish with the UConn Huskies and was the first title game to be contested by two undefeated teams.\nNotre Dame.\nNotre Dame, led by 27th-year head coach Muffet McGraw, ended the regular season with a perfect 29–0 record, including a 16–0 mark in Big East Conference games. They were the No. 1 seed in the ACC tournament, where they defeated No. 9 seed , No. 4 seed , and No. 2 seed Duke en route to their first ACC Tournament title and their seventh conference tournament championship in program history. They received a No. 1 seed and were placed in the eponymous Notre Dame Regional at the NCAA tournament. In the tournament, the Fighting Irish defeated No. 16 seed and No. 9 seed Arizona State to reach their 12th Sweet Sixteen. From there, the Irish defeated No. 5 seed and No. 2 seed to reach the Final Four for the sixth time.\nIn the Final Four, Notre Dame met No. 4 seed , champions of the Louisville Regional. A convincing win put the Fighting Irish in the national championship game for the fourth time; they entered seeking their second title.\nUConn.\nUConn, led by 29th-year head coach Geno Auriemma, finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, including an 18–0 mark in American Athletic Conference play. They received the No. 1 seed in the AAC tournament, where they defeated No. 8 seed , No. 4 seed , and No. 2 seed Louisville to win their first AAC Tournament title and the 19th conference tournament title in program history. In the NCAA Tournament, UConn received the No. 1 overall seed and was placed in the Lincoln Regional, where they defeated No. 16 seed and No. 9 seed to reach the Sweet Sixteen for the 22nd time. They then beat No. 12 seed BYU and No. 3 seed Texas A&amp;M to win the regional and reach the Final Four for the 15th time in school history.\nIn the Final Four, the Huskies met No. 2 seed Stanford, the champions of the Stanford Regional, whom they defeated to reach the national championship for the ninth time. The Huskies entered seeking to maintain their perfect record in national title games with their ninth championship.\nStarting lineups.\nOf the ten starting players for both teams, eight were eventually drafted in a WNBA draft. Three players – Notre Dame's Kayla McBride and UConn's Bria Hartley and Stefanie Dolson – were selected in the first round of the 2014 draft, which immediately followed the conclusion of the 2013–14 season. Notre Dame's Jewell Loyd and UConn's Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis were both first round picks in 2015, while UConn's Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson were first round picks in 2016. The last of the game's starting players to be drafted was Notre Dame's Lindsay Allen, who was a second round pick in 2017.\nGame summary.\nUConn controlled the game's tip-off and scored their first points of the contest ten seconds later. Both offenses got out to a strong start, with both teams holding leads within the first five minutes of the game and combining for 16 points with 15 minutes to play in the opening half. With just over five minutes elapsed, a Stefanie Dolson layup broke an 8–8 tie to give UConn back the lead; the Huskies would hold this lead for the remainder of the game. Dolson's layup was the second field goal in what would become a 14–0 Huskies run that gave them a 22–8 lead with eleven minutes to play. Trailing by 13 at the halfway point of the first half, the Fighting Irish were able to narrow the Huskies' lead to as few as six points over the next few minutes, but UConn was able to hold the lead steady and go into halftime with the score 45–38. Entering the second half leading by seven, UConn jumped out to a 10–2 run, spurred by field goals from Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Bria Hartley, Breanna Stewart, and Stefanie Dolson. Trailing 40–55, Notre Dame's Kayla McBride made a two-point jumper with just over fifteen minutes to play, narrowing the deficit to thirteen, but UConn's offense did not let up, as they reapplied pressure and increased the lead to 21 points with 12 minutes to play. The teams largely traded baskets for the next few minutes, with the margin hovering around the 20-point mark and peaking at 24 with just under four minutes to play. Notre Dame made no serious attempt to stop the clock, via fouls or any other method, and the game ended with UConn the victors, 79–58. With their victory, UConn broke the NCAA Division I record with their ninth national championship.\nMedia coverage.\nThe entire women's tournament, including the championship game, was televised in the United States by ESPN. The championship game drew an average viewership of 3.21 million households, which was the fourth-best mark for a women's basketball broadcast in ten years and the fourth-highest for any ESPN women's basketball championship broadcast. This also marked a 40% viewership increase from the last edition. The 100,000 viewers on WatchESPN also set an all-time high for a women's basketball broadcast."

The Delaware State League was formed with the teams in the Delaware cities of Camden, Dover, Milford and Wilmington joining Smyrna as charter members.\nEvolving from local semi–professional baseball, the Delaware State League structure was that each team was allowed to pay eight players and the league had no residency requirements. There was controversy over Dover’s signing of Bill Higgins, who had played in 14 major league games for the Boston Beaneaters the previous season. Smyrna claimed they had also signed Higgins. Dover threatened to fold their franchise over the dispute and review of the situation was resolved in favor of Dover.\nThe Delaware State League began play on July 8, 1889. A crowd of 600 was on hand to see Dover defeat Wilmington in the league opener. Smyrna began play under manager O.B. Voshell.\nAfter beginning play weeks earlier, the Delaware State League permanently folded on July 25, 1889. Smyrna reportedly couldn’t compete with other teams in player salaries and the team folded while in last place. Within two weeks, the entire league folded. The team records and standings on the folding date of July 25, 1889 were: Dover (8–2), Milford (6–5), Wilmington (5–4) Camden (3–6) and Smyrna (1–6).\nSmyrna, Delaware has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe name of the Smyrna home minor league ballpark in 1889 is not directly referenced."

There was also a push for the team to be reclassified as a major sport since it had turned a profit the previous year, as opposed to some actual major sports, namely baseball, tennis and track.\nThe team began the season with a winter carnival held at Lake Yosemite. The Bruins were entered in both the ice hockey and speed skating events and the school with the best combined finish would be awarded the President Herbert Hoover Cup. Despite high hopes, several injuries severely curtailed UCLA's ability compete. Eight players were injured with ailments ranging from a broken nose to a dislocated elbow. Worse, assistant coach Colonel Bain was struck in the head by a stick while standing on the bench. He received a concussion and a cut that required 8 stitches to close and it was possible he might lose sight in one eye. The team's second game resulted in the program's first win in almost 2 years and did give hope for the Bruins in spite of the injuries.\nUCLA was scheduled to compete in a second winter carnival, this time at Lake Arrowhead, but transportation difficulties caused the team to arrive just before night and the game was postponed. After winning their second game of the season, UCLA had to go into the rematch with Loyola missing their star center, Clarence Scott, who was suffering from a punctured Kidney. The team as a whole was rather battered by this point and the game was eventually postponed until later in the year.\nWhen the team returned to action in late February, coach Tafe made several lineup changes, including placing \"Frenchy\" LaGasse in goal. The team ended up producing its best effort to that point, winning the game 4–1. At this point the Bruins were well in the mix for a championship but they would have to do something they had never done in program history; defeat USC. With Scott still recovering from his Kidney injury, the team met the Trojans for the third time that season. Once again the game went into overtime and, once again, Southern California ended as the winner. The two teams had planned on having up to 5 games between one another during the season but, with USC already possessing two wins in conference play, the third game could end up being the last.\nUSC ended up winning the final match, shutting down the entire Bruin offense. Coach Tafe was so dissatisfied with his captain's play that he demoted Clow to the second line for the remainder of the season.\nNote: UCLA used the same colors as UC-Berkley until 1949.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Yosemite Sports Carnival\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The game was delayed, however, and the team played a familiar opponent to begin their season, Occidental. The team lost its first game in two years and followed that up with a second consecutive defeat, putting them in a poor position right at the start. With so few games on their schedule, UCLA couldn't afford to lose any more and the team recovered with a hard fought win in game 3. The two early losses, and USC's dominance over Occidental, meant that UCLA could only hope for a tie with the Trojans for the crown but that could only happen if the Grizzlies won each of their remaining 3 games.\nIn the pivotal game with Southern California, the Trojans got out to a 2-goal lead but UCLA was able to tie the game and make it look like they had a chance for a time. Unfortunately the attack from USC was to strong and the Grizzlies surrendered 6 goals, handing the city championship over to the Trojans. After a second loss to Occidental, the team's lineup was changed with Tafe dropping back to defense (where he had played the year before) and Al Johnson jumping up to the forward position. The game was delayed when USC got the date wrong and didn't show up to the game. The Grizzlies could have claimed a win on a forfeit but the team refused to do so. It was rescheduled for a week later but eventually cancelled.\nArtemus Lane served as team manager.\nNote: UCLA used the same colors as UC-Berkley until 1949.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "College ice hockey statistics",
        "text": "This is a list of current and former varsity ice hockey programs that played under NCAA guidelines and/or predated the NCAA's foundation.\nHistory.\nWhen the NCAA began overseeing college ice hockey in 1947, the statistical record keeping for players wasn't a priority. Teams were allowed to be entirely responsible for their own players' stats and, as a result, some programs have good existing records while others do not. Goaltender stats are particularly absent in many programs with several categories either missing or incomplete into the 1980s. As the importance of college hockey grew, with an increasing number of players having a chance at a professional career, stats became indispensable for players as a way of attracting attention from scouts.\nPre-NCAA records.\nFew schools track records prior to 1947. Most individual records from this period are missing and many of the statistics that exist cannot be verified. Of the existing marks, the pre-NCAA stats should be divided into three separate eras: pre-1920, 1920-1932 and 1932-1947. In the first era, teams played 7-on-7 for (typically) 40 minutes and many teams used the same lineup throughout the match. College hockey shifted to the modern 6-on-6 style shortly after World War I with the final recorded 7-on-7 match being played in 1921 (Harvard was the last holdout). About the same time, teams began playing three 15-minute periods rather than two 20-minute halves. The periods were soon expanded to 20-minutes for most contests throughout the 1920s until 60-minute games became the standard before the 1930s. 1932 was the first year that assists were officially recorded as a statistic. Initially only the primary assist was tracked, however, college teams soon began following the NHL model and the secondary assist was eventually recorded as well.\nThe records that follow are unofficial and few are complete.\nNCAA Division I men's records.\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe NCAA does not recognize any statistical achievements prior to 1947–48. Beginning that year and ending in 1963–64, all varsity programs played at the same level. Despite the NCAA creating the University- and College-tiers in the mid-50's there was only one national tournament and no official separation for college hockey. While there were informal tiers of play (the WCHA being regarded superior to the MIAC for instance), the delineation of college ice hockey was not formally introduced until ECAC 2 was formed and all lower-tier programs were placed in the College Division. Because of this, all scoring prior to 1964 was done at the equivalent of the Division I level. The NCAA created numerical divisions in 1973 and all university-division records were grandfathered into D-I.\nNCAA Division I men's leaders.\nA list of all-time statistical leaders. Only includes statistics recorded while playing at the Division I level or equivalent.&lt;br&gt;\nNCAA Division I men's leaders by team.\nA list of career leaders for current NCAA Division I programs.

        "text": "The 2021–22 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles during the 2021–22 NCAA Division I season. The Bruins were led by third-year head coach Mick Cronin and they played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members of the Pac-12 Conference. All ten players from the previous year's Final Four team returned. Johnny Juzang earned third-team All-American honors, and he was named first-team all-conference along with Tyger Campbell and Jaime Jaquez Jr. Jaquez, Jaylen Clark and Myles Johnson were also voted to the Pac-12 All-Defensive team. New this season is that the team's footwear, apparel, and equipment are provided by Jordan Brand and Nike.\nUCLA was ranked nationally in the top 10 for most of the season. They began the season 5–0 before facing Gonzaga in a rematch of the Final Four from the 2021 NCAA tournament. However, the No. 2 Bruins suffered their first defeat in an 83–63 blowout to the No. 1 Bulldogs. The UCLA team experienced a COVID-19 outbreak starting on December 15, 2021, causing them to cancel three nonconference games and postpone two Pac-12 games. The Bruins resumed play on January 6, 2022, against Long Beach State. At this time, the team began to play behind closed doors due to COVID-19 restrictions on indoor events implemented by the campus. The rematch against the Beach, who UCLA defeated earlier in November, was scheduled after the Bruins' original opponents that week, Arizona State and Stanford, needed to postpone due to coronavirus issues in their programs. It was the first time UCLA faced a nonconference opponent twice in the same regular season since 1982–83, when they faced Notre Dame in a home and away series.\nThe Bruins lost in overtime to Oregon on January 13, their first defeat since late November. UCLA then won six straight conference games, including their sixth consecutive over rival Arizona, to gain sole possession of first place in the Pac-12. However, the Bruins lost their third game in four contests after falling to their crosstown rivals, USC. It was their fifth straight loss to the Trojans, their longest drought in the series since the 1940s. UCLA ended the regular season winning six of their last seven games. They won their regular-season finale against USC to claim the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 tournament, breaking their tie with the Trojans for second place in the conference. It was the Bruins' first win in the series since February 2019, and their first under Cronin. UCLA advanced to the Pac-12 Tournament championship game, where they lost to Arizona. It was the Bruins' first appearance in the title game since their win in 2014 over the Wildcats.\nSeeded No. 4 in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, UCLA rallied in the opener for a 57–53 comeback win over 13th-seeded Akron. Campbell scored eight of the Bruins' final 10 points, and he finished with a team-high 16. The Bruins defeated fifth-seeded Saint Mary's 72–56 to advance to the Sweet 16 in consecutive seasons for the first time since 2015. UCLA was eliminated in the semifinals in a 73–66 loss to eighth-seeded North Carolina. The Bruins led by three points with two minutes remaining in a game that featured 14 lead changes and eight ties.\nOn March 25, assistant coach Michael Lewis was named as head coach of Ball State basketball team.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bruins are coming off of a season in which they made an improbable run in the NCAA tournament to the Final Four, where their upset bid against top-ranked Gonzaga in the National Semifinal fell just short in overtime, 93–90. UCLA, which had begun the tournament in the First Four, became just the fifth 11-seed to ever advance to the Final Four.

They first competed in the Super Series from its inception in 2015 until 2019, after which the tournament was reduced to two teams during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Dragons missing out. In 2022 the team returned to the Super Series and, after initially having no geographical base, would return with a \"Northern Irish focus\". They have won three Super Series titles: in 2016, 2018 and 2019.\nHistory.\nDragons were established in 2015 to compete in the Women's Super 3s, a tournament designed to bridge the gap between club cricket and international cricket in Ireland. The team was made up of some of the best players in Irish cricket, and were captained by Mary Waldron and coached by Rob O'Connor. In their first season Dragons finished 2nd in the group of 3, with four victories.\nThe following season, this time captained by Laura Delany, Dragons won their first Super 3s title, with four wins from six matches. They went unbeaten throughout the 50 over section of the tournament, and won one of their two T20s, a last ball thriller against Scorchers. The next season, 2017, Dragons fared worse, finishing bottom of the league with just two victories from ten matches.\n2018 brought a return to form for the Dragons, as they won their second Super 3s title, led by Shauna Kavanagh. Highlights for the season included Cecelia Joyce's 118 in a victory over Scorchers, and Lara Maritz's bowling performances throughout the season. The following season, 2019, Dragons retained their title, their second in two seasons and third overall. They were victorious in five of their 10 matches, with a further three curtailed due to rain. They were captained by Kim Garth and coached by Clare Shillington.\nIn 2020, the tournament was forced into a restructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was reduced to two teams, with Dragons the team to miss out. Due to the ongoing effects of the pandemic, Dragons were again unable to compete in 2021.\nIn 2022, it was announced that Dragons would return to the Super Series for the upcoming season. The returning side was to have a Northern Ireland focus, with half of the squad playing for Northern Irish clubs, and employing a Northern Irish-based coach, James Cameron-Dow. Leah Paul captained the side. The side finished as runners-up in the Super 20 Trophy and in third in the Super 50 Cup.

The ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. On 1 February 2022, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed the schedule for the tour. The ODI matches took place in Chittagong, with the T20I matches played in Dhaka.\nOn 13 February 2022, the Afghanistan team arrived in Sylhet to begin a week-long training camp ahead of the matches. However, shortly after the team arrived, eight Afghan cricketers and three members of their support staff tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, the entire touring party was placed into isolation for 48 hours. On 16 February 2022, all of Afghanistan's touring party returned negative COVID-19 tests. The team had requested a second round of testing after they believed the first round returned false positives.\nIn the first ODI, Afghanistan made 215 runs in their innings. In reply, Bangladesh were reduced to 45/6 in the twelfth over of their run chase, with Fazalhaq Farooqi taking four wickets. However, Afif Hossain and Mehidy Hasan then made an unbeaten 174-run partnership, with Bangladesh reaching 219/6 to win the match by four wickets. The 174-run stand between Afif Hossain and Mehidy Hasan was the highest seventh-wicket partnership for Bangladesh in an ODI match, and the second-highest seventh-wicket partnership in ODI cricket. In the second ODI, Litton Das and Mushfiqur Rahim set a new third-wicket partnership record for Bangladesh, with 202 runs. Bangladesh went on to beat Afghanistan by 88 runs, winning the series with a match to play. Afghanistan won the third ODI by seven wickets, with Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring an unbeaten century. Bangladesh won the ODI series 2–1.\nThe T20I series was drawn 1–1. Bangladesh had won the first T20I match by 61 runs, after making 155/8 in their innings, and bowling Afghanistan out for 94 runs.

The fixtures for the tour were confirmed in March 2022. In June 2020, the International Cricket Council (ICC) relaxed its rules on using neutral match officials, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2022, the ICC confirmed that neutral umpires would return to Test match cricket, with Richard Kettleborough from England and Joel Wilson of the West Indies standing in the first and second Tests respectively.\nThe first Test ended in a draw late on the fifth day, with Sri Lanka's Dinesh Chandimal and Niroshan Dickwella putting on an unbeaten partnership of 99 for the seventh wicket. Teammate Angelo Mathews was named the player of the match, after he scored 199 in the first innings. One the first day of the second Test, Bangladesh were reduced to 24/5 within the first hour of the match.

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured the West Indies in June and July 2022 to play two Test, three One Day International (ODI), and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The Test matches formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship. A draft tour itinerary was announced in May 2022. The full details of the tour were confirmed on 1 June 2022.\nOn 22 May 2022, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced all the squads for the tour to the West Indies, with Mominul Haque captaining the Test side. However, after Bangladesh lost their two-match Test series against Sri Lanka, Haque resigned as the captain of Bangladesh's Test team. Shakib Al Hasan was named as Bangladesh's new Test captain, with Litton Das being appointed as his deputy.\nA day before the first Test, the Test series was named as the Padma Bridge Friendship Series, to celebrate the inauguration of Bangladesh's ambitious Padma Bridge project. The West Indies won the first Test by seven wickets early on the fourth day, after Bangladesh were bowled out for just 103 runs in their first innings. The West Indies won the second Test by ten wickets to win the series 2–0. The defeat in the second Test was Bangladesh's 100th loss in Test cricket.\nBetween the Test and T20I series, Bangladeshi cricketers reported to have experienced an uncomfortable ferry ride, with several players suffering from motion sickness from high waves due to a cyclone two days previous. One of the players said to Prothom Alo \"We are the ones who can fall sick and die here, us, nothing will happen to them. I have toured many countries, this is the first time I am experiencing something like this. None of us are used to this. Forget about playing, what will happen if one of us gets seriously ill in the ferry. This is the worst tour of my life\".\nThe first T20I was delayed by nearly two hours due to a wet outfield. After several rain interruptions, only 13 overs of play was possible, with the match ending in a no result. The following day, the second T20I was played at the same venue, with the West Indies winning by 35 runs. The West Indies won the third and final T20I match by five wickets to win the series 2–0.\nBangladesh won the first ODI match by six wickets to record their first win of the tour. Bangladesh won the second match by nine wickets to win the series with a match to play. Bangladesh won the third ODI match by four wickets to win the series 3–0. Shortly after winning the series, Bangladesh's ODI captain Tamim Iqbal announced his retirement from T20I cricket.\nSquads.\nThe West Indies also named Tagenarine Chanderpaul and Shermon Lewis as reserve players for the Test matches. The day before the first Test, Kemar Roach was added to West Indies' Test squad. Romario Shepherd and Dominic Drakes were named as reserve players in the West Indies ODI and T20I squads respectively. Ahead of the first ODI, Keemo Paul tested positive for COVID-19 and was replaced by Romario Shepherd in the West Indies' squad.\nYasir Ali was ruled out Bangladesh's squad for the Test series after suffering a back injury in the warm-up match, with Anamul Haque named as his replacement. Yasir Ali was also later ruled out of the T20I and ODI matches, after failing to recover from his back injury. Ahead of the second Test match, Mohammad Saifuddin was also ruled out of Bangladesh's squad for the T20I and ODI matches due to a back injury.

        "text": "The Bangladesh cricket team toured Zimbabwe in July and August 2022 to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The original tour schedule was for two Test matches and three ODIs, but the Test matches were replaced by the T20I fixtures. All the matches took place at the Harare Sports Club. Prior to the series, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) named Nurul Hasan as their T20I captain for the tour, after Mahmudullah lacked performance and results. However, Nurul suffered a finger injury during the second T20I match and was ruled out of the rest of the tour. The BCB named Mosaddek Hossain as the team's captain for the third T20I match.\nZimbabwe won the opening T20I match by 17 runs. It was the team's sixth-consecutive win in T20Is, their best in the format. Bangladesh won the second T20I by seven wickets to level the series. Mosaddek Hossain took five wickets for 20 runs, the joint second-best bowling figures for Bangladesh in a T20I match. Zimbabwe won the third T20I by 10 runs to win the series by 2–1 margin, which was their first T20I series win against Bangladesh.\nIn the first ODI, Bangladesh scored 303 losing 2 wickets with their top four batters scoring fifties. In reply, Zimbabwe chased down the total with 10 balls to spare with the help of centuries from Innocent Kaia (110) and Sikandar Raza (135*). This was their joint-third highest successful run chase in ODIs. It was their first win against Bangladesh since 8 May 2013 ending their 19 successive defeats streak against Bangladesh. The 192-run stand between Innocent Kaia and Sikandar Raza for the fourth wicket was their highest partnership for any wicket against Bangladesh as well as their fourth highest partnership for any wicket.\nIn the second ODI, Batting first, Bangladesh managed 290 runs in 50 overs. In reply, Zimbabwe lost four wickets in quick succession. But, the 201-run stand between Sikandar Raza and Regis Chakabva helped their side to win the match by 5 wickets, and Zimbabwe took an unassailable lead of 2–0 in the series. In the process, Raza scored back-to-back centuries in this ODI series and Chakabva scored his maiden ODI century off 73 balls, the fastest century by a Zimbabwean batter.\nIn the third ODI, Bangladesh could only manage 256 with the help of two half-centuries from Anamul Haque and Afif Hossain. In reply, Zimbabwe kept losing wickets at regular intervals and they were reduced to 83/9. But the 68-run stand between Richard Ngarava and Victor Nyauchi helped them to reduce the defeat margin before they were bowled out on 151 and Bangladesh won the match comprehensively by 105 runs. Eventually, Zimbabwe won the ODI series by a 2–1 margin.\nSquads.\nBangladesh's Nurul Hasan suffered a finger injury during the second T20I match and was ruled out of the rest of the tour. Mosaddek Hossain was named as the T20I captain for the third match, with Mahmudullah added to Bangladesh's T20I squad in place of Nurul Hasan. Before the first ODI, Craig Ervine was ruled out of the series due to hamstring and knee injury and Regis Chakabva was named as the captain for the ODI series. Sean Williams was also granted leave from the ODI series due to personal reasons. Brad Evans was added to the Zimbabwe's squad in place of the injured Tendai Chatara. Litton Das and Shoriful Islam suffered injuries during the first ODI and were replaced by Mohammad Naim and Ebadot Hossain respectively."

The Raiders represented the Colgate University and played their home games at Class of 1965 Arena, and were coached by Don Vaughan, in his 28th season as their head coach.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Colgate's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nThe start to Colgate's season was a bit rough as the team won 1 of their first six games. They recovered afterwards and nearly reached a .500 record by early February but the team flagged afterwards and ended the season last in the conference. The Raiders met St. Lawrence in the ECAC Tournament and outplayed the Saints but still managed to lose 4–5 in overtime. The poor finish should be taken with a grain of salt, however, as eight of the twelve ECAC teams had cancelled their seasons. This resulted in Colgate playing 21 out of 22 games against Clarkson, Quinnipiac and St. Lawrence, two of which were ranked throughout the season. The only real takeaway from the season for Colgate was that the team has some work to do if they want to compete against Clarkson and Quinnipiac.\nMitchel Benson, William Friend, and Henry Marshall sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Saints represented the St. Lawrence University and were coached by Brent Brekke, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of St. Lawrence's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAfter an abysmal season, St. Lawrence continued to see a great deal of roster turnover as the program recovered from Mark Morris's tenure. The Saints got a late start to the season, even after the delay due to COVID, but the team played surprisingly well once they got on the ice. buoyed by the play of junior netminder Emil Zetterquist, SLU gave opponents fits throughout the season, holding at least a .500 record until February when the team ran into league-leading Quinnipiac and lost four consecutive matches against the Bobcats. Even with the losses, however, St. Lawrence kept the score close and demonstrated great strides by a team that had finished last in the ECAC for three consecutive years.\nSt. Lawrence's final matchup of the regular season was cancelled when Clarkson ended their season due to COVID protocol violations. The Saints ended in 3rd place, giving them a home game for the ECAC Tournament. Ordinarily this would have been seen as a positive for the team, but St. Lawrence hadn't won a single home game through 7 games. Despite the recent history, SLU produced its largest offensive output of the season and defeated Colgate 5–4 in overtime. The Saints found themselves playing for a chance to go to the NCAA Tournament despite a 5–8–3 record and got out to an early lead. Quinnipiac took over in the second and then tried to play in a defensive shell for the remainder of the contest but the Larries scored late and then David Jankowski scored the game-winner in the fourth minute of overtime.\nThe miraculous, albeit short, run for the Saints gave them their first league championship in 20 years and their first tournament berth since 2007. Unfortunately, everything came crashing to a halt a day later when Brent Brekke tested positive for COVID-19 and St. Lawrence was forced to withdraw from the tournament. St. Lawrence was just the second ECAC Tournament champion to not play in the NCAA Tournament and the second time a team declined an automatic invitation to a national tournament, the previous time for both was by Harvard in 1963.\nGrant Adams and Luke Erickson sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The Brigham City team was a minor league baseball team based in Brigham City, Utah in 1921. Brigham City was noted to have used the \"Peaches\" moniker as the team played as a member of the Class D level Northern Utah League in 1921, winning the league championship.\nHistory.\nBrigham City was a charter member of the Northern Utah League. The league first began play in the 1921 season as a six–team Class D level minor league. The Northern Utah League's charter franchises were based in Brigham City, Lewiston, Idaho (Lewiston Broncs), Logan, Utah (Logan Collegians), Ogden, Utah (Ogden), Smithfield, Utah (Smithfield (baseball)|Smithfield) and Tremonton, Utah (Tremonton) in the newly formed league.\nMultiple reports and a team photograph reference the 1921 Brigham City moniker as the \"Peaches.\"\nThe \"Peaches\" moniker corresponds to local industry, agriculture and culture. Since 1905, the city has hosted an annual \"Brigham City Peach Days.\"\nBrigham City began play as members of the Northern Utah League on May 4, 1921. The Northern Utah League played a split season schedule. The second half began on July 4, 1921. The six–team league overall standings in database references consisted of Brigham City (7–9), the Lewiston Broncs (4–11), Logan Collegians (8–9), Ogden (11–5), Smithfield (6–10) and Tremonton (12–4). With their 12–4 record, Tremonton had the best record in the league. Records differ and it was reported that Brigham City won the first half standings with a 12–8 record and Tremonton finished 15–5 tied with Ogden and won a playoff to win the second half standings. Brigham city was credited with an 8–12 second half record to finish 4th.\nRecords conflict, but the \"1921 Northern Utah League Summary\" by Ray Olson, the league secretary, has the Brigham City \"Peaches\" winning the overall championship after winning the first half with a 12–4 record. In the summary, Tremonton won the second half after beating Ogden in a three–game playoff series. In the championship series for the league title, the Brigham Peaches reportedly defeated the Tremonton \"Bears\" 3 games to 2 to win the league championship.\nThe Northern Utah League permanently folded as a minor league following the 1921 season. Brigham City, Utah has not hosted another minor league team. The Brigham City Peaches continued play in the many decades to follow, playing under the moniker as a semi-professional team and collegiate summer baseball team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe exact name the Brigham City 1921 minor league home ballpark is unknown.\nNotable alumni.\nNo members of the 1921 Brigham City team reached the major leagues."

The league was an attempt by Hal Shapiro to revive professional football in Richmond, Virginia after the Richmond Rebels from the Continental Football League had folded.\nThe league featured five teams, but best team in the league was Shapiro's Richmond Mustangs, while the other teams talent-level was closer to a semi-pro squads. Although the Mustangs and Knoxville Bears drew good crowds, the league folded after only one year with large debts to the players. \nThe UAFL was featured in a short segment in CBS by Heywood Hale Broun. \nHistory.\nThe UAFL was formed in 1967 by Hal Shapiro in attempt to revive professional football in Richmond, Virginia after the last incarnation of the Richmond Rebels had folded in 1966. Shapiro build a team from local football stars, called them \"Mustangs\" and appointed former Washington Redskins running back Dick James as the head coach. The league teams were hastily put together, with local players which resembled more of sandlot or semi-pro football than a professional. Richmond and Knoxville were able to attract good crowds, but the other teams in the league had trouble to attract spectators, especially the Georgia Raiders from Marietta, GA who attracted only 100 fans to a their home games.\nRichmond beat the other opponents by blowout fashion, but decided to run the score against Savannah Indians, because one of their players spit in on one of the Mustangs players, finishing with a 105-0 win. After the game the Indians decided to drop out the league and played the rest of the season (and onward) in the South Carolina Semi-Pro Football League. \nAfter the season the Mustangs changed it name to the \"Richmond Roadrunners\", and continue playing three more independent games under new management, and later joined the Atlantic Coast Football League for the 1968 season.\nStandings.\nThe Richmond Mustangs were considered \"Champions\" after finishing the season undefeated."

        "text": "The 1939–40 Duquesne Dukes men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season even began, Duquesne got unwelcome news when their biggest rival and the only team to defeat them all of last year, Pittsburgh, terminated their hockey program. While their withdrawal would make it easier for the Dukes as far as winning games, the still-young program had bigger concerns. The Loss of Pitt meant that the team would have to travel to Cleveland more often, increasing the cost of running the team, and it would likely damper interest in the sport from locals. On top of those problems, what did it say about the league when one of the best teams for the first two seasons (Pitt had made the conference final both years) just quit before the season was to begin? In spite of the troubles, the remaining 6 teams and the rink operators decided to continue with the league and set down the schedule in early December.\nThe Dukes got off to a good start, winning their first five games and sitting atop league standings with John Carroll. The program went on its first non-conference road trip in mid-January, playing three non-conference team in a swing through upstate New York. While it wasn't a surprise to lose to Clarkson, getting embarrassed by the tune of 10–0 was not what the Dukes were hoping for. To make matters worse, they team lost the other two games by sizable margins and made it look like the team had been living in a too-comfortable bubble with the Penn-Ohio League. Despite the losses, Duquesne did achieve its main goal by introducing itself to other programs and hoped that they would be able to schedule further games in the future.\nDuquesne sat out the rest of the semester for examinations and came back at the beginning of February. The team met John Carroll for a home-and-home series with league bragging right on the line. The powerhouse Blue Streaks took both games to make it nearly impossible for Duquesne to repeat as regular season champions, but the Dukes could still make the playoffs as long as they took care of business. The Dukes recovered from their losing streak with three consecutive wins and guaranteed themselves a second-place finish despite having two games remaining.\nIn the playoff series against John Carroll, Duquesne played the undefeated Blue Streaks about as well as could be expected. They lost a close affair in the first game and then pushed JCU into overtime in the rematch. Unfortunately, Duquesne wasn't able to tie the series and fell 5–6.\nThe loss was the last for the program as both Duquesne and Carnegie Tech suspended their ice hockey teams after the year. The Penn-Ohio League would continue for one more season with 4 schools before dissolving in 1941.\nDoug Wells served as team manager\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Penn-Ohio League Playoffs"

        "text": "John Craig Skinner (born June 4, 1969), known as Craig Skinner, is an American collegiate women's volleyball head coach at the University of Kentucky. He is the winningest coach in Kentucky volleyball history and led Kentucky to their first-ever NCAA volleyball national championship in 2020.\nPersonal life.\nSkinner is a native of Muncie, Indiana and played volleyball at Ball State from 1990 to 1993 as an outside hitter. Prior to playing volleyball at Ball State, Skinner played football at Michigan for one year. Additionally, he is an avid golf player and lived in Wales for two years, taking up rugby and cricket while living there.\nHe is married to former Nebraska women's soccer assistant coach, Megan Bechtold Skinner. The couple have three children.\nCollegiate coaching career.\nPrior to collegiate coaching, Skinner also had coaching roles with high school and high school club volleyball, leading the Munciana Volleyball Club to become a national powerhouse. Skinner also coached at Muncie Burris High School.\nWisconsin (1994-1998).\nUnder head coach John Cook, Skinner was the women's volleyball assistant coach, helping them to an 68–35 record during his tenure.\nBall State (1999-2000).\nIn 1999, Skinner joined his alma mater and was the assistant coach on the men's volleyball team for nearly 2 seasons (leaving midway through the 2000 season), helping Ball State to wins over nationally ranked opponents.\nNebraska (2000-2004).\nCook hired Skinner as Nebraska as assistant coach in 2000 and was promoted to head assistant coach in 2003. Skinner helped the team to the 2000 NCAA title and undefeated season and four Big 12 titles. Overall, Skinner helped lead Nebraska to a 154–11 record.\nSkinner revealed in 2010 that Nebraska made a metal monument of him as a surprise but Skinner did not want one and made Nebraska destroy it.\nKentucky (2005-present).\nAfter the 2004 season, Skinner had several head coaching opportunities but chose Kentucky because of the comfort level with the campus, UK being a flagship university, the proximity to the talent hotbeds in the Midwest and soccer opportunities for his wife.\nSkinner took over at Kentucky in 2004 and is the program's all-time winningest head coach. Skinner has led the Wildcats to 16 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, including tallying 20 or more wins in 12 of the last 14 seasons. In the five years before his arrival, Kentucky didn't post a winning season and hadn't made the NCAA tournament since 1993. Skinner posted a 17–13 record in his first year, won SEC coach of the year and qualified for the postseason. The Wildcats haven't missed the NCAA tournament in the 16 years since.\nIn the 2020 Women's volleyball tournament, Skinner made history and led Kentucky to their first NCAA title in women's volleyball. The Wildcats only lost 2 sets across five tournament matches and became only the eleventh school to win an NCAA Division I volleyball championship.\nDuring his tenure, the Wildcats have amassed 23 All-America first, second or third team distinctions, while UK has hauled in 61 All-Southeastern Conference honors in his 15 seasons - including the 2008, 2018, 2019 and 2020 SEC Player of the Year, 2006, 2016, 2017 and 2018 SEC Freshman of the Year, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 SEC Libero of the Year and the 2005 SEC Defensive Player of the Year.\nIn 2019, Skinner signed a contract extension through the 2023–2024 season. Skinner signed another contract extension on July 1, 2022, through the 2027 season.\nSkinner’s success at the helm of the program continued after winning the national title in 2020. In 2022 Kentucky earned in 6th straight conference title (tying with Florida for first place). Several players received conference and national\naccolades as well: Sophomore setter Emma Grome was named the SEC player of the year, while\nGrome, senior outside hitter Adanna Rollins and junior opposite hitter Reagan Rutherford all received AVCA All-Southeast Region First team selections. In 2023, Kentucky won its 7th straight conference title as Skinner was named the 2023 SEC co-coach of the year."

        "text": "The 1920–21 Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey season was the 16th season of play for the program. The teams was coached by Nick Bawlf in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter World War I, the continued interest in ice hockey prompted Cornell to restart its varsity program. The school brought in Nick Bawlf to head the program as well as the lacrosse and soccer teams, and he set about rebuilding the Big Red. The biggest impediment for the program, as it had been before the war, was the lack of an ice rink either on campus or otherwise. The team was forced to use Beebe Lake despite several attempts to build artificial rinks. Weather would be a constant source of frustration for the men's team for the next 37 years.\nCornell's season began against Hamilton and, unsurprisingly, the team lost its first game in almost 5 years. The Big Red went scoreless but the did keep the game close, losing 0–2 in front of a good-sized crowd. In the game Cornell eschewed the rover position, deciding to go with the updated rules that had only six players on each side. The second game a week later had a much better result for the team. After small adjustments to the lineup, Cornell scored 10 goals in the 40-minute match to get their first win since 1916.\nAfter the win the team didn't play another game until mid-February due to semester exams. When the team rejoined several changes had been made. Their goaltender Whitehall had been replaced by Kaw while Rollo and McDonald were gone from the team. The changed didn't prevent the Big Red from winning as they defeated Colgate in their final home game and prepared for a renewal with a pair of old rivals. Pennsylvania was making their third attempt at a varsity team but now the squad had access to a home rink. Cornell played its first game at a proper ice rink when they arrived for a game at the Philadelphia Ice Palace. The two sides were evenly matched and finished regulation tied 3–3. Penn scored a goal in the waning minutes of overtime and Cornell couldn't produce the equalized with little time remained. Their final game of the year came a week later against Columbia, who were returning to the game after a longer layoff than Cornell. The game was close early but Cornell surged at the end, scoring 4 goals late to win 7–4, ending their season with a winning record.\nM. G.

The Buckeyes represented the Ohio State University and were coached by Steve Rohlik, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Ohio State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nOhio State had a rather bad season. The team started with middling performances and got progressively worse as the season went along. The Buckeyes' offense was hampered by the loss of their top two scorers from the year before (through graduation) but their defense was just as poor if not worse. OSU was shut out 8 times during the season and, despite some impressive performances, averaged less than two goals per game. The team allowed an average of 3.72 goals against (only three teams averaged worse) nearly a goal and a half more than they had the year before. With both their offense and defense heading in the wrong direction, Ohio State finished with its worst record in 26 years.

        "title": "North American Rugby League",
        "text": "The North American Rugby League (NARL) is an unsanctioned rugby league club competition in North America.\nAt launch, the league announced fourteen teams; twelve from United States and two from Canada. An inaugural season was planned for 2021 but was deferred until 2022 (which itself never happened) due to increased health and safety needs regarding COVID-19 and insurance and travel costs.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nAn American based rugby league competition was first established in 1998 when the American NRL was formed. The organisation ran the AMNRL league competition and organised the USA national team and their fixtures. This competition lasted for 13 years until seven clubs left to form the USARL, citing the poor running of the competition as their reason for a breakaway. \nThe USARL was founded in 2011, however the AMNRL was still active, meaning there were two major rugby league competitions in the US. The AMNRL suffered from competition with the USARL and did not run a competition in 2013. The following year the AMNRL folded and handed over all control of the USA national team to the USARL making it the sole governing body and league competition in the US.\n2016–2020: North American clubs in Britain.\nIn 2016, Toronto Wolfpack were founded and entered the British RFL system in League 1. They were promoted to Super League in 2019, however withdrew after seven rounds in 2020 following financial problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and were not readmitted for the 2021 season. The demise of Toronto and a report by then-Super League chief executive Robert Elstone saying there were no opportunities for rugby league in North America left doubts over transatlantic teams competing in the British rugby league system. However, the RFL later admitted Ottawa Aces and New York Rugby League. Ottawa, however, later relocated to the UK as Cornwall. New York's future in the UK remains unclear.\n2021: COVID-19 postponement.\nIn March 2021 the North American Rugby League was announced and slated to include 14 founding teams: the two clubs previously accepted into the RFL (Ottawa and New York) as well as Toronto and recently formed Cleveland, along with three USARL clubs (Atlanta Rhinos, Boston Thirteens, and Brooklyn Kings), a former rugby union club, and six new clubs (Austin Armadillos, Las Vegas Blackjacks, Phoenix Venom, Portland Loggers, San Diego Swell, San Francisco Rush, and Washington D.C. Cavalry.\nIn April 2021, USARL issued a statement that NARL is not recognized or sanctioned by USARL (as the governing body for rugby league in the USA) and therefore anyone playing in the NARL was ineligible to play at international level.\nThe inaugural season was due to start on June 19, 2021, with Boston hosting the first four Eastern Conference games and Las Vegas hosting the Western Conference games on June 20, with all games to be streamed globally on SportsFlick. There are plans for clubs to draft 14 players who will be signed centrally by the NARL. On May 12, the league announced that the Western Conference would be postponed to 2022 as the teams were unable to arrange adequate insurance for the players. \nOn June 7, 2021, Robert Curtis, the league's chief operating officer, announced that competition would be suspended until 2022 due to cost issues and health and safety restrictions relating to COVID-19. Some friendly matches will be played and the Canada Cup will be contested by Toronto Wolfpack and Ottawa Aces.\nFollowing the announcement of the league's suspension, USARL issued a statement that all NARL teams and players would be welcome to join USARL for the 2021 season.\nThe league has partnered with Italian sportswear company Macron, who will provide kits to all teams in the competition.\nIn October 2021, the Ottawa Aces announced their relocation back to the United Kingdom, where they had been originally formed, opting out of the NARL. \nThe league announced in late 2021 that it intends to launch with just 6 foundation clubs in spring 2022, 5 from the United States plus Toronto Wolfpack from Canada.\nThe Canada Cup went ahead for 2021 but DC Cavalry took Ottawa's places following the latter's relocation to Cornwall. The match was won by Toronto.\n2022: Second failed inaugural season.\nAfter an announcement for the 2022 season to start on May 21 followed by uncertainty, it was announced a day before on the NARL social media pages the expected kick off that there will be a pre-season trial on June 4 between Washington D.C. Cavalry and the Atlanta Rhinos. Atlanta won the match 34-24.

        "text": "The 2002 Winter Olympics cauldron held the Olympic flame during the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.\nDescription and history.\nThe Cauldron was designed with the official 2002 Olympic motto \"Light the Fire Within\" and the \"Fire and Ice\" theme in mind. It was designed to look like an icicle, and was made of glass which allowed the fire to be seen burning within. The actual glass cauldron is high and stands atop a twisting glass and steel support, while the flame within burns at . Together with its support the cauldron stands tall and was made of 738 individual pieces of glass. Small jets send water down the glass sides of the cauldron, both to keep the glass and metal cooled (so they would not crack or melt), and to give the effect of melting ice. The cauldron was designed by WET Design of Los Angeles, California, its frame built by Arrow Dynamics of Clearfield, Utah, and its glass pieces created by Western Glass of Ogden, Utah. The cauldron's cost was 2 million dollars, and it was unveiled to the public during its original install at Rice-Eccles Stadium on January 8, 2002.\nDuring the Games, the cauldron was installed atop stands at the south-end of the stadium, which allowed it to be seen burning from various points around the Salt Lake Valley. Just prior to the start of the opening ceremony, wind blew out the pilot lights on the cauldron, requiring a failsafe plan to be activated. This plan required that the flame be manually pulled up with a string to ignite the cauldron.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Games, the cauldron moved to the \"Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Cauldron Park\" just south of the stadium. There it was installed in a reflecting pool, at the center of the park, and was flanked by a V-shaped stone wall. The stones on this wall were engraved with the names of the 2002 medalists, and water cascaded down into the reflecting pool from the top of the wall. The cauldron remained operational and was lit on special occasions, which included the opening weekend of the 2006 Winter Olympics. During the 10-year anniversary of the Olympics, on February 8, 2012, an attempt was made to light the cauldron, but it did light but not on mark and remained lit for only a short period of time. The delayed lighting was blamed on weathered mechanical parts and a lack of maintenance.\nTo accommodate expansion of Rice-Eccles Stadium, the former cauldron park was removed in 2020. The cauldron itself was taken down on February 14, 2020 and transported to an off-site location where it underwent a refurbishment. The refurbishment included replacing all 738 panes of glass, wiring the structure with LED lights, and replacing the flame mechanisms to improve energy efficiency. The work was overseen by VCBO Architecture. The cauldron was installed atop a new pedestal (with a cascading water feature) at the Olympic and Paralympic Cauldron Plaza on January 29, 2021. This plaza replaced the former park and was officially unveiled on October 29, 2021."

With Father Louis A. Deitrich heading the new program, a roster was assembled mostly from the previous year's championship club team. The team's first scheduled game was cancelled when the University of Akron wasn't able to continue with the league. Instead, the team played its first game against Pittsburgh on December 14. The game was attended by about 1,000 fans and saw Duquesne win their first ever varsity hockey game.\nDuquesne didn't play for several weeks afterwards due to the Christmas break, but they returned with a second victory, this time over Carnegie Tech in mid-January. The team got a wake-up call in early February when they lost consecutive games and dropped to 2nd in their division. Since Pitt was also a very strong team that season, the Dukes couldn't afford too many losses if they wanted a division crown. They responded with an inspired brand of hockey and won their final 7 games of the regular season. In that time, Duquesne provided the biggest upset of the Penn-Ohio League by defeating John Carroll who, until that point, had been undefeated.\nIn the program's first playoff game, Duquesne fought a close affair with Pittsburgh but were able to triumph 1–0 over the Panthers. Because the league had decided on a two-game total-goal series, the win didn't give the Dukes much of a cushion and they couldn't afford to lost the second game. Unfortunately, Pitt rallied and a hat-trick from Bob Schooley gave the Panthers a 3–0 in and ended Duquesne's season on a sour note.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Penn-Ohio League Playoffs"

The annual event determines the conference champion of the Division I Southern Conference in college baseball. The tournament winner earns the league's bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. This is the last of 20 athletic championships held by the conference in the 2020–21 academic year.\nThe tournament was originally held from 1950 to 1953, when the Southern Conference was a large conference composed of several small schools and several large schools, the latter of which would form the Atlantic Coast Conference after the 1953 season. The event was re-established in 1984 and has been held every year since with the exception of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled sporting events across the country. Western Carolina has claimed ten championships, the most of any school, with The Citadel close behind at eight tournament wins. Defending champion Mercer and Samford are the only other current schools with multiple championships, having each won two. East Tennessee State and VMI have never won a title, although they both returned to the conference in 2015 after over ten years in other conferences. Furman, which dropped its baseball program before the 2021 season, won two titles.\nThe tournament will be played in Greenville, which has hosted seven of the past eleven events, including the past four.\nSeeding and format.\nIn a change from most years due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, only four teams will participate. The top team from each division, and the next two teams by conference winning percentage, regardless of division, will qualify."

We both played at good levels, but went through a lot of different things and we are really passionate about trying to help guys who are transitioning out of rugby and the younger generation coming through.\nWe don't want them to get as low as we were at one stage and we hope that Make Minds Move can get more guys talking with their team mates and their former team mates as well as opening up in general with the physical challenges thrown in to really get people focused on something away from the rugby field, but something that is testing and fun.\nHogg and Clayton completed a 24 hour cycling marathon in June 2020.\nBusiness career.\nHe was a Sports Agent for TDB Sports in 2020.\nHe now works as a Sales Executive for Borders Motor Group.\nFamily.\nHis brother is the Scotland international player Stuart Hogg.\nHis father John Hogg won the league with Hawick and is now a rugby union referee."

        "text": "The South Florida Bulls tennis program represents the University of South Florida in the sport of tennis. The program consists of separate men's and women's teams and competes in the American Athletic Conference within NCAA Division I. The Bulls men's tennis team is coached by Ashley Fisher and the women's team is coached by Cristina Moros. Both teams play their home matches at the USF Varsity Tennis Courts on USF's campus in Tampa, Florida.\nMen.\nThe Bulls men's tennis team was founded in 1966 as one of the seven original varsity sports to be offered at USF, beginning as an NCAA Division II program. The team did not see much success in Division II, but made the NCAA Division I Men's Tennis Championship in 1974, their first season in Division I. Upon joining the Sun Belt Conference in the 1976–77 season, the Bulls won each of the first four conference championships. However, the Bulls did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament again until 1995. They have won 20 total conference championships, the second most of any USF team behind only men's soccer. They have also qualified for 17 NCAA Tournaments, with their best performance coming in 2015 when they made it to the Round of 16.\nWomen.\nUSF's women's tennis team was also founded in 1966, making it the oldest women's team at the school. As the NCAA did not sponsor women's sports until 1982–83, the Lady Brahmans as they were known at the time first competed in the United States Lawn Tennis Association. They qualified for nationals in the USLTA four times and finished third in the nation in 1970 and 1971. Beginning in 1977 they joined the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. They made the national tournament in the AIAW three times, with their highest finish being 11th place. In 1984 they won their first ever conference championship, though they had competed without a conference affiliation until the 1983 season. They also qualified for the NCAA Division I Women's Tennis Championship for the first time in the 1984 season. As of 2020, the Bulls women's tennis team has won 13 conference titles, the second most of any women's team at the school. In addition they have qualified for 12 NCAA Tournaments, though they have only reached as far as the second round in the NCAA, and have done so three times."

        "text": "The 1939–40 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season was the 3rd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nFor the team's third season, a man who knew ice hockey was brought in to head the team. Vic Heyliger, a Michigan alum, began making his mark on the team and an exhibition game in December gave a preview of how things were going to shake out for the Illini. The Freshman squad defeated the varsity team 13–5. While this was good news in some respect, as the freshman team provided hope for the team improving as soon as 1940, the varsity squad couldn't use any of those players this season. If they were so thoroughly dominated by their own 1st-year players, how would the varsity team fare in the rest of their season?\nThe question was answered rather quickly when Illinois welcomed Minnesota for their season-opening series and were promptly shelled by the powerhouse Gophers. Despite the uneven scores, John Gillan performed admirably in net, stopping 92 shots in two games. A week later, Illinois was in Ann Arbor and struggled to score, earning 1 goal in each of their two games against the Wolverines, but they were able to allow far fewer goals to the Maize and Blue.\nThe team took a few weeks off for examinations and then returned in Early February with a dominating performance over Saint Louis. Despite missing coach Heyliger to illness two players (Stewart and Mettler) to ineligibility, the team won their first game of the season 11–0. Joe Lotzer set a program record with 7 points in the game (3 goals, 4 assists). The good feelings didn't last long, however, as Illinois travelled to meet undefeated Minnesota in Minneapolis the following weekend and were shelled again in both games.\nHeyliger returned after the losses to Minnesota and took the team down to St. Louis for the rematch with the Billikens club team. Despite poor ice the team won 3–0 and then travelled north for their first ever meeting with Michigan Tech. Illinois faced the Huskies in four consecutive games, the first two being on the road, and lost all four matches. While the Illini weren't as outclassed as they were against the Gophers, the team still had trouble scoring and could only notch more than 1 goal in their final meeting. The team ended its season with a home series against Michigan and, after getting shut down in the first game, the team roared back with a tremendous effort. The Illini were finally able to finish their scoring chances and fired three goals into the net while John Gillan shut the door on the Wolverines. The win was not only the first for Illinois against a Big Ten team, but their first against any varsity squad.\nJames Stables served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Kevin Kelley (American football)",
        "text": "Kevin Kelley (born June 25, 1969) is an American football coach who is currently the head coach at Sheridan High School in Sheridan, Arkansas. He formerly served as the head coach at Presbyterian College. Prior to his hiring at Presbyterian, Kelley was the head coach and athletic director at Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he won nine AAA state championships and employed a unique strategy that involved rarely punting and almost always attempting onside kicks and two-point conversions.\nEarly life and education.\nOriginally a native of Hot Springs, Arkansas, Kelley attended Glenwood High School in Glenwood, Arkansas, which has since consolidated with a nearby school to become Centerpoint High School. Kelley then attended Henderson State University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1992. He was the first member of his family to graduate from college.\nCoaching career.\nCarrollton ISD.\nKelley began his coaching career at the Carrollton-Farmers Branch Independent School District in Carrollton, Texas. From 1993 to 1997, in addition to teaching earth science, he served as the head coach of one of the district's 7th-grade teams while also serving as a scout for one of the senior high teams.\nPulaski Academy.\nKelley arrived at Pulaski Academy in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1997, and he served as their offensive coordinator until 2002. He was promoted to head coach in time for the 2003 season.\nFrom 2003 to 2020, Kelley served as the head football coach at Pulaski Academy. He has gained notoriety for his unique numbers-based coaching strategy, which involves rarely punting and almost always attempting fourth down conversions (\"going for it\"), onside kicks (unless his team is leading by 21 points or more), and two-point conversions. Kelley's teams were consistently competitive; the Bruins won nine Arkansas Activities Association state championships under his direction, were named to the list of the top ten Arkansas football dynasties, at No. 5, by MaxPreps in 2011, and as the No. 1 most dominant Arkansas high school football program of the decade in 2020. Additionally, Kelley's offenses own each of the top 12 highest single-season yardage totals in Arkansas high school history.\nPulaski won their first title under Kelley in 2003, in his first season at the helm of the program, and subsequently won titles in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020; Pulaski's four consecutive titles from 2014 to 2017 made them only the fourth team in Arkansas high school history to do so, and the first since Barton High School from 1986 to 1989. Prior to the start of the 2020 season, Kelley was listed as having the 15th-highest all-time winning percentage among high school football coaches.\nKelley was named the \"USA Today\" High School Coach of the Year in 2016 and was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in April 2021. Bill Belichick said of Kelley in December 2020 that he was \"...probably the top high school coach in the country,\" and mentioned that he \"[had] great respect for coach Kelley\". Kelley's strategy has been the subject of reports by \"The New York Times\", \"Sports Illustrated\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Time\", and was included in a chapter of \"Scorecasting\", a book by Toby Moskowitz and L. Jon Wertheim.\nIn an interview shortly after he was hired by Presbyterian, Kelley told Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports that he was most proud of his offensive acumen, and noted that his play-calling style was as heavily data-driven as his more publicized special teams idiosyncrasies. Kelley considers his offensive philosophy \"intermediate\", which he defines as geared heavily toward midrange passes in front of the safeties, with a high percentage of pass plays designed to generate yards after the catch. According to Thamel,\nPresbyterian.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2020 season, there were some ideas that led to speculation that Kelley could be considered for a Division I job, namely the head coaching position at Kansas, a job Kelley supposedly said he would accept for $90,000 per win. Ultimately, Kelley was hired as the 16th head football coach at Presbyterian College on May 6, 2021. He took over the Blue Hose program for their first full season in the Pioneer Football League after a shortened 2021 spring season under Tommy Spangler.\nKelley communicated his decision in an email to Pulaski Academy parents on May 6, and the college officially announced the hire on May 7, 2021.\nIn Kelley's debut as Presbyterian head coach on September 4, 2021, the Blue Hose broke two significant passing records in their 84–43 win over NAIA member St. Andrews. Ren Hefley threw for 10 touchdowns, breaking the previous FCS record of 9 first set in 1984 by Willie Totten of Mississippi Valley State and equaled in 2007 by Drew Hubel of Portland State. With backup quarterback Tyler Huff adding 2 TD passes, the Blue Hose set a new Division I team record (for both FCS and FBS) of 12, breaking the previous record of 11 set in 1990 by Houston quarterback David Klingler.\nOn December 4, 2021, Presbyterian College announced that Kelley had stepped down as head coach due to personal reasons. He amassed a 2-9 record in his only year at Presbyterian.\nOn Monday December 11,2023, Kelley was named the new head coach of the Sheridan Yellowjackets.\nPersonal life.\nKelley and his wife, Dana, have two children."

        "text": "The West Side Rowing Club is a rowing club in Buffalo, New York. The club's athletes train, practice, and race along the Black Rock Canal and the Buffalo River. West Side is one of two rowing clubs in the city of Buffalo, the other being the Buffalo Scholastic Rowing Association to the south of downtown. \nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1912 at the southern tip of Squaw Island, now known as Unity Island. Although originally a men's club, West Side began sponsoring youth rowing programs as early as 1921. In 1975, the club burned down but was rebuilt in its present location near Porter Avenue shortly thereafter. Women's rowing began at West Side in 1978 and, as of 2023, outnumbers the men's programs. In 2007, the club expanded its facilities with the addition of a second boathouse. Using plans created for the University of Wisconsin by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, the Fontana Boathouse was built to house additional equipment and teams.\nThe club has produced rowers and coaches who have won multiple medals in the Summer Olympic Games. Tom Terhaar, coach of the United States National Women's Rowing Team, has won gold at every Summer Olympics game since 2008. Emily Regan, also a Buffalo native and a graduate of Nichols School, won gold at the 2016 Summer Olympics under Terhaar.\nPrograms.\nThe club offers programs to athletes in the junior, senior, master's, and pararowing boat classes, while also attracting athletes from area schools not offering rowing teams. Six high schools are partnered with West Side, including the Nichols School, Mount Saint Mary Academy, Nardin Academy, Gow School, St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute, and the public City Honors School. In addition to high schools, several colleges and universities are affiliated with the club, including Buffalo State College, Canisius College, and D'Youville College, all based within the city. The University at Buffalo, the larger SUNY university in the area, trains and races on Tonawanda Creek in the town of Amherst, but has been based at West Side in the past.\nEach year, the West Side Rowing Club hosts between three and five regattas on the Black Rock Canal. The regattas draw thousands of athletes and hundreds of boats from the Western New York region, across the country, and internationally with Canada.\nFacilities.\nThere are two facilities on the grounds of the West Side Rowing Club. The Doc Schabb Boathouse features an indoor rowing tank, ergometers and five bays of boat storage. The Fontana Boathouse was built in 2007 and is the newest facility at the West Side complex, home to the Canisius Golden Griffins women's crew since 2011. The design of the boathouse was adapted from plans by architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the Wisconsin Badgers Crew. When the University of Wisconsin–Madison suspended its football program in 1906 over safety concerns, plans for the boathouse were abandoned. Wright's plans were later reintroduced at West Side and the boathouse was constructed, opening in 2007."

The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" reported that \"neither side took the game especially seriously\", and it was noted by \"ESPNcricinfo\" that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting, \"the concept would have shuddered\". However, Ponting himself said \"if it does become an international game then I'm sure the novelty won't be there all the time\". This is a list of Netherlands cricket team's Twenty20 International records. It is based on the List of Twenty20 International records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the Dutch men cricket team. Netherlands played its first Twenty20 game against Kenya in August 2008, and these records date from that game.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties, all round records and the partnership records.

        "title": "1941–42 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1941–42 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season was the 5th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAs the season began, most were expecting Illinois to be in the thick of things for an Intercollegiate title. The team returned 8 players from the previous season's championship team and, though it had lost Norbert Sterle to the professional ranks, the rest of the team should be better with more time to practice. Coach Heyliger scheduled 16 games for the Illini, including a showdown with eastern power Dartmouth, but was unable to come to terms with their Big Ten rival Minnesota.\nIllinois was set to begin their season on December 8 against the London Athletic Club and ended up played the game on the same day as the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Due to the outbreak of the war, the status for most players was up in the air. Starr Owen and Gil Priestly enlisted in the army, but were given special permission to remain enrolled at Illinois for a time. Both players were able to participate in the two Dartmouth games before Christmas and the team needed every advantage to take on the powerful Indians. Unfortunately, permission for both players was withdrawn on the day of the game and the Illini had to go without two of their best forwards. Instead, the starting forwards for the team were the Eveleth boys, Roland DePaul flanked by brothers Mario and Aldo Palazzari. The Illini scored early in the game but their offense couldn't get another past the Dartmouth netminder for the remainder of regulation. The Indians tied the score mid-way through the game but were equally stymied by Ray Killen. The game broke open in the overtime session and Darmouth scored three goals in quick succession to take the first game. The second match happened two days later at home and both teams looked much better on offense. Illinois built a 4–2 lead early in the third but could no longer contain Dartmouth's star player. Dick Rondeau, who already had a goal and an assist to that point, took over and scored two unassisted goals (one with 15 seconds remaining) to tie the game and send the two teams into overtime. With just 30 second left in the extra session he scored his fourth of the night to tip the scales in favor of the green, leaving Illinois heartbroken over their lost sweep of the Indians.\nDue to Minnesota's refusal to play Illinois, Big Ten bragging rights would be determined by how the two teams fared against Michigan. The Illini sent 13 men to Ann Arbor, losing Joe Brooks to a broken hand, but the Wolverines were missing 4 players due to academic ineligibility and were soundly defeated in both games. The three Minnesotans were front and center, scoring 10 goals and 16 assists combined in the two games. The following week the team played host to Michigan Tech and throttled the Huskies, earning the Illini's second shutout of the year. With the team's record at 6–1 they were well on their way to winning an Intercollegiate title but the team was about to suffer major losses.\nWhile second and third on the team in scoring, sophomores Mario Palazzari and Roland DePaul left school to sign with Akron, a farm team for the Cleveland Barons. Clint McCune also left school, following Owen and Priestly into the military. While McCune's loss was not a surprise, losing two of the three Eveleth players was, particularly since neither had informed Heyliger or Aldo Palazzari of their intentions. The rumor at the time was that both players had poor grades and were going to be ruled ineligible after the semester break anyway. Joe Brooks was ruled ineligible after failing an exam. The team almost lost Amo Bessone to the war but he was able to receive a deferment while \"Bibbs\" Miller had to return home to report to his draft board.\nAs the team was preparing for its rematch with Michigan Tech, they received more bad news as Aldo Palazzari's GPA had fallen below the required 2.75 and he was now ineligible for the remainder of the season. The team ended up losing Russ Priestly and Lou Ferronti for academic reasons as well, leaving Vic Heyliger with just 8 players (2 of them goaltenders) by early February. Somehow, the crippled team managed to earn a tie with MTU in the first game before suffering a seemingly-inevitable loss in the final match. After the game two games against Colorado College were cancelled due to constraints of the war. A second series was still scheduled for early March.\nBefore their next game against the Paris Athletic Club, Illinois lost team captain Joe Lotzer when he had to return home after the sudden death of his mother. \nBefore the game, however, the team finally received some good news; Lou Ferronti had passed a special examination and was allowed to participate in the game. With new add Twitchell and defensive convert Benson on the starting forward line, Illinois fought a hard-earned victory over the Canadian amateur club. Benson's hat-trick in the second period lifted the Illini to victory and gave them hope that they could finish out the season well.\nLotzer returned for the next game against Brantford A.C. but the team was routed by a 4-goal third period from the visitors. They recovered for a 5–3 win in the second match to earn a split. A week later the team headed to Colorado to take on the Colorado College. The Tigers were a tough team but had had a rough go early that left them with a losing record. Illinois was slow out of the gate, shooting just 22 shots in the first game and fell 2–4. The Illini recovered a bit in the second game, earning a 3–3 tie, but their claim on a second intercollege title had taken a hit. Despite their misfortune, however, the team could end the season on a high-note against Michigan. The Wolverines had given the Illini a gift by defeating Minnesota in one of their four games, meaning that the Illini could claim an (unofficial) conference championship with two wins. In the first game the depleted Illini were still heads-and-shoulders above the Wolverines and outshot their opponents 49–27 en route to a 6–2 win. Illinois capped off its season with a convincing 9–4 win to seal a conference title. The game was highlighted by an assist from Jack Gillan in his final game; the goaltender made a save and the puck rebounded half-way down the ice where it was picked up by Benson and slipped to Ferronti, who ended the scoring on a 10-foot shot. It was likely that most of the team had played their final games as most were expected to be drafted shortly thereafter.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 2021 Challenge Cup Final was the 120th final of rugby league's Challenge Cup knock-out competition. It took place on 17 July 2021 at Wembley Stadium between Castleford Tigers and St Helens.\nBackground.\nThe 2021 Challenge Cup Final was \nthe first time St Helens and Castleford Tigers have played each other in the Challenge Cup Final. St Helens are the competition's third most successful side having won the competition 12 times previously, with their last victory coming at their last final appearance in 2008. Castleford Tigers have reached the final more recently in 2014 where they were beat 23–10 by Leeds Rhinos. They last won the competition in 1986, winning the competition for the fourth time.\nOwing to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Challenge Cup this year only included Super League, RFL Championship and RFL League 1 clubs and did not include any amateur clubs or British forces teams.\nRoute to the final.\nCastleford Tigers.\nAs a Super League side, Castleford Tigers entered the competition in the third round. For the 2021 competition, the third round is the equivalent of the competition's usual sixth round due to the fact that the first three rounds of the competition were removed as non-professional sides were not allowed to compete due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Castleford drew fellow Super League side Hull KR in their opening game where, following a 32–32 scoreline at full time, a drop goal from Gareth O'Brien saw them through to the quarter finals in golden point extra time. The quarter finals saw the Tigers face Salford Red Devils in a game which again saw the two sides draw at full time. It was again a drop goal from O'Brien in golden point extra time which saw Castleford enter the semi-finals ending the game 19–18. The semi-final draw saw the team play Warrington Wolves in a game where Tigers led comfortably following the first 15 minutes, seven tries including a hat-trick from Jordan Turner booked Tigers a place at Wembley with a 35–20 final score.\nSt Helens.\nSt Helens' third-round match saw them draw last season's champions Leeds Rhinos; a comfortable 26–18 scoreline helped by a brace from Regan Grace saw Saints enter the quarter finals. A quarter-final tie against their 2006 Final opponents Huddersfield Giants saw another comfortable 23–18 victory and a place in the semi-finals. Saints' semi-finals game against Hull F.C. saw a much more open game with St Helens claiming a more high scoring game of 33–18. The victory came following a shaky start to the match and an early penalty lead for Hull, however following its conversion Saints gained control of the match.\nPre-match.\nOfficials.\nThe refereeing team for the final was announced on 13 July. Liam Moore was appointed the referee, his second final in succession; Chris Kendall was named as video referee; the touch judges, Jack Smith and Tom Grant; and James Child and Neil Horton the reserve referee and touch judge respectively.\nTicketing and stadium capacity.\nIn March, it was announced by the Rugby Football League (RFL) that they hoped the final would be held with a 50 per cent capacity crowd pending British pandemic lockdown restrictions being eased. First priority for tickets would be given to people who had bought tickets for the 2020 final, which had been held behind closed doors, and had opted to roll them over to 2021. The ticket allocation for the finalists as well as the teams involved in the RFL 1895 Cup Final was due to be released on 7 June but this was delayed by the RFL pending further information from the government relating to stadium capacity limits. On 21 June, it was confirmed that 45,000 spectators could attend the match, which equated to half the stadium's capacity."

        "text": "The Naugatuck Valley League was a minor league baseball league that played in the 1896 season. The Non-Signatory Independent level league consisted of franchises based exclusively in Connecticut. The six–team league evolved into the 1897 Connecticut League.\nBaseball Hall of Fame member Candy Cummings managed the 1896 Torrington Tornados team in the Naugatuck Valley League. Fellow Hall of Fame member Jim O'Rourke was the Naugatuck Valley League founder and owner/player/manager for the Bridgeport Victors team while leading the league in batting average.\nToday, the league name has been adopted by the high school athletic Naugatuck Valley League, based in Connecticut.\nHistory.\nFormed for the 1896 season, with league founder Jim O'Rourke helping organize the league teams, the Naugatuck Valley League began play on May 6, 1896, as a six–team league. The Naugatuck Valley League was a Non-Signatory Independent level league under the direction of league president D.W. Porter.\nThe league name derived from the location of member teams within the Naugatuck River Valley region in Connecticut.\nThe Naugatuck Valley League vegan minor league play in 1896. The six charter members were the Ansonia Blues based in Ansonia, Connecticut, the Bridgeport Victors from Bridgeport, Connecticut, the Derby Angels from Derby, Connecticut, the New Haven Edgewoods from New Haven, Connecticut, the Torrington Tornadoes from Torrington, Connecticut and Winsted Welcomes from Winsted, Connecticut.\nThe Naugatuck Valley League standings were led by the 1st place Bridgeport Victors with a 25–15 record. Bridgeport finished 1.0 games ahead of the second place Torrington Tornados (24–17), followed by the Derby Angels (22–18), New Haven Edgewoods (22–18), Winsted Welcomes (15–25) and Ansonia Blues (12–28). After the season, the Naugatuck Valley League permanently folded, playing only the 1896 season. Baseball Hall of Fame member Candy Cummings was a manager for the Torrington Tornados team.\nBaseball Hall of Fame member Jim O'Rourke was owner/player/manager for the Bridgeport team, leading the 1896 Bridgeport Victors to the Naugatuck Valley League championship as a manager and leading the league with a .437 batting average, playing catcher at age 46. O'Rourke had been instrumental in forming both the Bridgeport franchise and the league itself after returning to his hometown of Bridgeport upon ending his major league career. O'Rourke graduated from the nearby Yale Law School in 1887, this after negotiating payment of the college tuition into his major league contract. O'Rourke continued minor league play for Bridgeport teams aging into his late 50's and was a practicing attorney. On July 1, 1903 was joined by his son Jimmy O’Rourke in the lineup for the Bridgeport Orators of the Class D level Connecticut State League, becoming the first known father and son duo to play together in an organized professional baseball game.\nAfter the 1896 season, with Jim O'Rourke still organizing the league, four of the Naugatuck Valley League teams continued play as members of the renamed 1897 Connecticut League. The Bridgeport, Derby, Torrington and Winstead teams continued play in the new league, joined by Bristol and Meriden teams.\nToday, the league name has been revived by the high school athletic Naugatuck Valley League. The league has 16-member high schools, all based in Connecticut.\nStandings &amp; statistics.\n1896 Naugatuck Valley League.\n "

The Divisional alignment was abandoned and John Carroll' schedule was rearranged so they would face the Cleveland teams three times each and the Pittsburgh teams twice. It didn't much matter to the Blue Streaks players as the team ran through all of their opponents en route to an undefeated season. Led by senior co-captains Eddie Arsenault and Fred Rancourt, JCU averaged more than five and a half goals per game, never scoring fewer than three and allowed just over a goal a game during the regular season. The team's closest affair was after a long layoff against Carnegie Tech, a 3–2 win.\nIn the league playoffs, Duquesne fought well, scoring against the Blue Streaks as well as any team in the three-year history of the team, but it wasn't good enough. John Carrol swept both games and captured their third consecutive Penn-Ohio League championship.

        "text": "The 1940–41 John Carroll Blue Streaks men's ice hockey season was the 4th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nJohn Carroll was entering its fourth year riding a 29-game winning streak and was the three-time champion of the newly-renamed Ohio League. The program only really had two problems; a diminishing pool of opponents and a lack of attendance. Herb Bee had attempted to schedule games against other midwestern teams like Michigan and Minnesota but, despite some interest in facing the high-scoring Blue Streaks, no games outside their league were ever agreed to. As a result, all of JCU's games were against the relatively poor competition of the Penn-Ohio League, as evidenced by their sterling record. The disparity in play also had an unwelcome side-effect: apathy. John Carroll was the best team in the conference in each of the first three seasons, but was so far ahead of all other programs that the league had been disintegrating. Pitt and Baldwin Wallace left after two years and were followed by Duquesne and Carnegie Tech in 1940. The league now had just 4 members and was in jeopardy of disappearing altogether.\nIn spite of these troubles, John Carroll was still hoping that the program could be saved and league patron Al Sutphin had a plan. The owner of the Cleveland Barons offered a special deal for season tickets in the hopes that attendance to the games would increase. In the opening game of their season, Carroll's winning streak ended with a tie. The team was unable to break the deadlock in overtime because a public skate was scheduled for immediately after the match. The team responded with a win the following week to at least extending their unbeaten streak to 32 games.\nJCU continued to win all of their games, but as the season went on it became apparent that Case and Western Reserve were catching up to the Blue Streaks. Near the end of the season, John Carroll finally managed to play its first non-conference game when they travelled to Johnstown to take on Penn State. The Nittany Lions were only a year old and had barely played any other varsity programs so it was a bit of a surprise to see the team give JCU a tough fight. The Blue Streaks won to keep their streak going but the 3–2 match was much closer than they would have wanted.\nJohn Carroll won the Ohio League with an undefeated record and entered the playoff ready for its 4th title. The team won a close game against Case in the first match and need one more win for the championship. The team had trouble scoring against the Rough Riders for the second straight game, and both teams ended regulation with just a single goal. The two teams went scoreless in the first five minute extra session and any further periods used sudden death rules. At the end of the third 5-minute overtime the winning goal was finally scored, unfortunately it came from a Case stick. The goal tied the season and ended John Carroll's unbeaten run at 41 games. It was the first time JCU has lost since January 1939. The win seemed to buoy the Rough Riders, who scored 6 times in the finale, the most John Carroll had allowed in any game in its history, and wrested the championship from the Blue Streaks.\nThe loss was the last the JCU hockey team would ever endure. The team's future was in jeopardy before the following season had even began but, after Herb Bee left to coach professionally, the outbreak of World War II put an end to any chance of a season. Without access to the Cleveland Arena after the war, the team had no chance to restart and the program was no more.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Penn-Ohio League Playoffs"

        "text": "The 1930–31 Marquette Hilltoppers men's ice hockey season was the 9th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nBefore the season began, Marquette had to content with forces that were affecting everyone in the region. The reality of the great depression was beginning to set in and two NIHL member schools suspended their programs (Michigan State and North Dakota Agricultural College). While the league was effectively dissolved by that point, Marquette's team was popular enough to stave off oblivion for the time being, but the Hilltoppers saw an old nemesis rear it head. The region experienced a warm winter, costing the team much-needed practice time. With a great many new faces in the lineup and a new head coach to boot, Marquette opened with a sleepy fist game before coach Hancock took the team on a northern trip. In their 3-game swing through Minnesota the team got the needed ice time and began working together. The Hilltoppers didn't have the same scoring punch they had with the loss of their two Canadian stars, but the Blue and Gold could play defense well.\nMarquette headed to Madison for their first intercollegiate game of the season and took on the Badgers. Wisconsin had just come off of back-to-back shutouts over Michigan and continued their stellar play by holding the Hilltoppers to a single goal. Marquette's defense was up to the challenge and allowed just one score themselves, leading the game into overtime. During the extra time, captain Bill Schultz made a save on a 15-foot shot but the referee ruled that he had been behind the goal line and counted a score for the Badgers. Marquette was unable to equal the score before time expired and found themselves behind the eight ball. Marquette returned home and played host to Michigan the next weekend. Unfortunately, the ice at the rink became slushy and the first game was marred by slow play. The Hilltoppers eked out a 4–2 victory in overtime but, due to the poor ice, Michigan called off the second game.\nA few days afterwards, Minnesota arrived in Milwaukee but the Gophers were still finding their feet with a new bench boss. After a close game that ended in a draw, Marquette dominated the second match and won 6–3. Just when it looked like the Hilltoppers had a chance at another Intercollegiate title, warm weather forced them to take a few weeks off with sparse practice time. When they arrived in Ann Arbor they were met by a Michigan team looking for revenge. The Wolverines swamped the Hilltoppers, winning both games in the series and leaping ahead of Marquette in the process. The Hilltoppers travelled to Minneapolis the next weekend and battled the Gophers in the second series of the year. Marquette's defense was much improved from the week before and the Hilltoppers limited Minnesota to a single goal in each game. After sweeping the series they returned home and managed to play one more game, evening the score with Wisconsin, before ending their season earlier than usual.\nThe two losses to Michigan cost Marquette an opportunity to win an Intercollegiate title but the team still performed well in spite of the troubles they faced.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "title": "Great Britain at the 2022 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Great Britain competed at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, from 4 to 20 February 2022. The Great Britain team consists of 50 athletes (27 men and 23 women). Eve Muirhead and Dave Ryding were the country's flagbearers during the opening ceremony. Meanwhile curler Bruce Mouat was the flagbearer during the closing ceremony.\nBritish athletes won a total of two medals (one gold, one silver). This result was described as a 'disappointment' by UK Sport. Despite the underwhelming games, Great Britain ranked 19th on the medal table, the same ranking as the previous three Winter Olympic Games.\nMedal and performance targets.\nIn July 2018, UK Sport announced a preliminary target of 5–12 medals for the Games, which would at least sustain the level of success experienced at the previous two Games, in both of which 5 medals were won. On 13 January 2022, UK Sport confirmed that they have a target of 3–7 medals for the Games.\nSummary.\nThe team won two medals (a tally below the 3-7 medal target set by UK Sport) during the course of the Games, both in curling. This is also three medals less than the team achieved at both the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics. The women's team, skipped by Eve Muirhead won gold, beating Japan 10-3 in the gold medal game, and the men's team, skipped by Bruce Mouat won silver, having lost the gold medal match to Sweden 5-4 after an extra end. The gold medal from women's curling team ensured Great Britain won at least one gold medal for a fourth consecutive Winter Olympics. However, there was no repeat of the successes of previous Olympic Games in the sliding sports, particularly in skeleton, where Great Britain failed to win a medal - the first time this had happened since skeleton was included as an event. 2018 bronze medallist Laura Deas finished 19th. The team had other high hopes with Charlotte Bankes being one of the favourites to win the Women's Snowboard Cross event, but she was beaten in the quarter-finals and finished ninth overall. Izzy Atkin who won a bronze in 2018 in the Women's Ski Slopestyle also dented the team's hopes of further medals, after she withdrew from the games due to injury.\nAdministration.\nOn 24 May 2020, Team GB announced that former modern pentathlete Georgina Harland would become the first woman to act as Chef de Mission for the British team at an Olympic Games. A bronze medal winner at the 2004 Games in Athens, she went on to serve as a deputy Chef de Mission at both the 2016 and 2020 Summer Games in Rio and Tokyo respectively.\nMedallists.\nThe following British competitors won medals at the games. In the by discipline sections below, medallists' names are bolded.\nCompetitors.\nThe team includes three sets of siblings: Izzy and Zoe Atkin (Freestyle skiing); Leonie and Makayla Gerken Schofield (Freestyle skiing); and Farrell and Niall Treacy (Short track speed skating). Gus Kenworthy (Freestyle skiing) competed for the United States at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Games winning a silver medal at the former. In 2019 he announced that he would seek to represent Great Britain at the 2022 Games. He is a dual national having been born in Chelmsford to a British mother and American father.\nFormer sprinter Montell Douglas (Bobsleigh) became the eighth British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Games. She was preceded by Ethel Muckelt (Figure skating at both Games) and Percy Legard (Modern pentathlon/Nordic combined) in the inter-war period. Like Douglas five other athletes have transferred from athletics to bobsleigh in more recent decades: Colin Campbell; John Herbert; Marcus Adam; Philip Harries; and Allyn Condon. She was the first British woman to compete in different sports at the Summer and Winter Games. Douglas was also one of two athletes together with Jaqueline Mourão of Brazil to have competed at both Beijing 2008 and 2022.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating at the Games per sport/discipline.\nAlpine skiing.\nFollowing the qualification period, Great Britain had achieved two quota places in both men's and women's alpine skiing, as a result of which, Great Britain also qualified for the team event. On 21 January 2022, Team GB announced the selection of the four athletes who will represent Great Britain in Beijing led by slalom skier Dave Ryding who will be competing at his fourth Games. On 10 February, Team GB announced that they would not be entering a team in the Mixed Team event.\nBobsleigh.\nFollowing the conclusion of the qualification period in Bobsleigh, Great Britain had qualified sleds in the four-man, two-man and two-woman disciplines. Qualification in the two-woman discipline also granted a place in the monobob event. On 20 January 2022, Team GB announced the selection of eight athletes including two reserves to compete in Beijing. The squad was led by drivers Brad Hall (men's two and four-man bobsleigh) and Mica McNeill (women's monobob and two-woman bobsleigh). In the two-man event, Hall and Nick Gleeson crashed during their third run and eventually finished the event in 11th position.\n \nBen Simons and Adele Nicoll were travelling reserves\nCross-country skiing.\nBy meeting the basic qualification standards, Great Britain has qualified at least one male cross-country skier. Following the end of the qualification process, Great Britain had accepted three quota places, all in the men's events. On 22 January 2022, Team GB announced the names of the three athletes who will compete in the cross country events in Beijing. Andrew Musgrave and Andrew Young will both be competing at their fourth Games.\nDistance\nSprint\nCurling.\nOutside of the Olympic Games, Great Britain competes under the flags of its constituent home nations, Scotland, England and Wales (Northern Irish players compete for a combined Ireland); Scotland results are treated as Great Britain for the purposes of Olympic qualification.\nSummary\nMen's tournament.\nGreat Britain has qualified their men's team (five athletes), by finishing in the top six teams in the 2021 World Men's Curling Championship. On 14 October 2021, the British Olympic Association announced that Team Bruce Mouat would be their men's team representatives.\nRound robin\nGreat Britain had a bye in draws 1, 5 and 9.\nDraw 2\n\"Thursday, 10 February, 14:05\"\nDraw 3\n\"Friday, 11 February, 9:05\"\nDraw 4\n\"Friday, 11 February, 20:05\"\nDraw 6\n\"Sunday, 13 February, 9:05\"\nDraw 7\n\"Sunday, 13 February, 20:05\"\nDraw 8\n\"Monday, 14 February, 14:05\"\nDraw 10\n\"Tuesday, 15 February, 20:05\"\nDraw 11\n\"Wednesday, 16 February, 14:05\"\nDraw 12\n\"Thursday, 17 February, 9:05\"\nSemifinal\n\"Thursday, 17 February, 20:05\"\nGold medal game\n\"Saturday, 19 February, 14:50\"\nWomen's tournament.\nGreat Britain has qualified their women's team (five athletes), by finishing first in the round robin in the 2021 Olympic Qualification Event.

        "text": "The UT Arlington Movin' Mavs men's wheelchair basketball team, previously known as the UTA Freewheelers, is the men's college wheelchair basketball team representing the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Established in 1976 as the UTA Freewheelers, the team played at the club level against other colleges and universities in Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. It has played under the auspices of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) since 1988, when the team was renamed the Movin' Mavs. Its inaugural coach, from 1976 until 2008, was Jim Hayes. The team was coached by Doug Garner from 2008 until 2022 when he retired. In fall of 2022, Aaron Gouge was hired as the new head coach for the team.\nThe Movin' Mavs have won ten National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT) national championships: 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 2002, 2006, 2017, 2021 and 2022. The program has produced over 25 Paralympians from 1992 to present.\nHistory.\nUTA Freewheelers.\nThe Freewheelers were founded in 1976 at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) by Jim Hayes. That year, Hayes also founded and began serving as the inaugural director of UTA's Office for Students with Disabilities. He formed the wheelchair basketball team to \"get disabled students out of their rut\". The first Freewheelers team had six players, including both UTA students and staff, with Hayes as a player-coach. In 1977, the Freewheelers won one of their first games against the Houston Cougars men's wheelchair basketball team. While the Freewheelers did not have enough players to achieve intercollegiate status, they played as a club team against other colleges and universities in Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. They also played intrasquad games, and by 1987 had enough players to form four separate teams.\nMovin' Mavs under Jim Hayes.\nIn 1988, the UTA Freewheelers joined the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) and changed their name to the Movin' Mavs. The name \"Movin' Mavs\" was suggested by former UTA men's basketball coach Snake LeGrand. In 1991, the team won its first intercollegiate division national championship, defeating the Wisconsin–Whitewater Warhawks, 58–48. Led by All-Americans Steve Welch, Jesus Alamillio, Willie Hernandez, Jason Van Beek, and Javier Gonzalez, the Movin' Mavs repeated as champions in 1992, 1993, and 1994, defeating the Illinois Fighting Illini in each of those three years. Following the 1993 championship, the Movin' Mavs became the first collegiate wheelchair basketball team to be official guests at the White House when President Bill Clinton invited them. The United States Congress also passed a resolution congratulating the team on winning their third straight national championship.\nFollowing their four straight championships, the Movin' Mavs lost in the championship game in 1995 and 1996, falling to Illinois, 55–53, and Wisconsin-Whitewater, 64–59, respectively. In 1997, UTA defeated Wisconsin–Whitewater, 59–46, en route to their fifth national title. The team fell to Illinois again in the 1998 championship, and then missed the title game for the first time since 1990 during the 1999 tournament. In 2000 and 2001, the Movin' Mavs returned to the national championship game, but lost both games to Illinois, both by eight points. From 2002 to 2006, the Movin' Mavs faced Wisconsin–Whitewater in the national championship game each year. They won in 2002 and 2006, 67–58 and 55–53, respectively, but lost in each of the three seasons between those two championships.\nUnder Hayes, 20 Movin' Mav players and alumni competed in the Paralympics. Seven UTA players were named most valuable player (MVP) of the NWBA's intercollegiate division: Steve Welch (1991, 1992), Rusty Belknap (1994, 1995), Jason Van Beek (1994), Donnie Keller (1996), Paul Schulte (1999, 2002), Mikey Paye (2006), and Aaron Gouge (2007). A total of 25 Movin' Mavs were named National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament (NIWBT) first-team All-Americans.\nHayes coached the Movin' Mavs until his death in May 2008 at the age of 58. He was posthumously inducted into the NWBA Hall of Fame in March 2012.\nMovin' Mavs under Doug Garner.\nIn October 2008, assistant coach Doug Garner was named the second-ever head coach of the Movin' Mavs. He had arrived at UTA in 2007 as an assistant coach on the staff of Jim Hayes. In his first season as head coach, 2008–09, Garner and the Movin' Mavs finished with a 18–6 record and finished in third place at the 2009 NIWBT tournament in Whitewater, Wisconsin. In the 2009–10 season, the Movin' Mavs finished with a 27–7 record and another third-place finish at the 2010 NIWBT tournament in Marshall, Minnesota, beating the Alabama Crimson Tide in the third-place game. In March 2011, UTA hosted the 2011 NIWBT tournament at Texas Hall. The Movin' Mavs finished their 2010–11 season with another third-place finish in the NIWBT tournament, losing to Illinois in the semifinals before again defeating Alabama in the third-place game. In October 2011, during the Jim Hayes Memorial Tournament, the Movin' Mavs played their last game at Texas Hall. In the 2011–12 season, the Movin' Mavs clinched the number one seed for the NIWBT tournament during the regular season, but were defeated by fourth-seeded Illinois the semifinals of the tournament in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, ultimately besting Alabama once again in the third-place game. Seven UTA alumni competed in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, including wheelchair basketball players David Eng (who won a gold medal with Canada), Brad Ness (silver medal with Australia), and Jason Nelms and Paul Schulte (bronze medals with the United States).\nIn January 2013, the Movin' Mavs made their debut at College Park Center, splitting two games of a doubleheader, losing to Alabama 64–56 and then defeating Illinois 59–54. The 2012–13 team entered the NIWBT tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, ranked first in the country, ultimately finishing as runner-up after losing to Alabama 71–52 in the national championship game. The 2013–14 team hosted the national tournament at College Park Center but lost to Wisconsin–Whitewater in the championship game, 55–54. In April 2014, the team played an exhibition game at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington as part of the 2014 NCAA Men's Final Four. From October 31 to November 2, 2014, the Movin' Mavs hosted the Jim Hayes Memorial Tournament in memory of long-time coach Jim Hayes. The 2014–15 team finished third in the national tournament in Columbia, Missouri, losing to Illinois in the semifinals, 58–57, but defeating the host Missouri Tigers in the third-place game, 84–53.\nThe 2015–16 Movin' Mavs finished in third place in the NIWBT tournament after defeating Illinois 63–59 in the consolation game. A total of ten UTA student-athletes and alumni competed in the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, including three Movin' Mavs alumni: Aaron Gouge and Michael Paye, both representing the United States, and David Eng, representing Canada. The 2016–17 team won UTA's first national championship in 11 years, defeating defending champion Wisconsin–Whitewater 76–52 in the title game. The 2017–18 team finished third place in the NIWBT tournament in Marshall, Minnesota, defeating Missouri 49–35 in the third-place game. The 2018–19 Movin' Mavs similarly finished the NIWBT tournament in third place, again besting Missouri, 65–46, in the tournament in Champaign, Illinois. In March 2020, the 2020 NWBA national collegiate tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020–21 Movin' Mavs won the ninth national championship in program history at the national tournament, defeating host Alabama 66–51 in the championship game.\nCoaches.\nJim Hayes, originally from Fort Worth, Texas, graduated from UTA in 1974 and spent his entire professional career at the university. He served as the director of UTA's program for disabled students. In 1976, Hayes founded the UTA Freewheelers. In 1988, he led the team as they joined the NWBA's Intercollegiate Division and changed their name to the Movin' Mavs. He coached the team until his death in May 2008. He was posthumously inducted into the NWBA Intercollegiate Division Hall of Fame in March 2012. Under Hayes, the team won seven national championships.\nDoug Garner, originally from Camden, Arkansas, joined the Movin' Mavs as an assistant coach for Jim Hayes in 2007. After Hayes' death, he was named interim head coach, and was promoted to head coach on October 15, 2008. Garner was inducted into the NWBA's Hall of Fame in March 2019.

The team's rink, that they had used for their first two seasons, had been converted into a garage and the team was forced to instead use an outdoor rink built over a field north of the university gym. To make matters worse, the winter was a bit warmer than usual and led to less ice available than previous years. The team was also contending with their third coach in three seasons, however, Harold \"Ed\" Garry had been the team's primary goaltender over the previous two seasons and he was familiar with the players and their situations.\nMany games were scheduled for the season, mixing old and new opponents, but a lack of ice limited the team to just three games. The Blue and Gold won their first game of the season against a nearby YMCA squad with captain Nic Carle scoring the lone goal. When the team travelled to Minnesota to take on the Gophers, the team was overcome by a combination of skill and manpower; Minnesota was the defending western champion and used three full lineups while the Blue and Gold had just one alternate, Harold Bruce. Minnesota scored early in the games and then used fresh legs to outskate Marquette, leading to a pair of shutouts. The Blue and gold would have to hope for better conditions the next year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

When the team opened the season against Wisconsin, the Badgers challenged Gordon Thomas's eligibility, saying that he had already used up his three years of eligibility. The captain was able to get in the second game, strengthening the team, but it didn't change the outcome and Marquette was swept in their opening weekend.\nThe team played their first home game in nearly two years when they took on defending western champion Minnesota. The Blue and Gold demonstrated a great deal of improvement with a 0–0 tie I the first game. The Gophers couldn't be contained, however, and ended up winning the next game 4–1 with captain Thomas scoring Marquette's first goal of the season. The Blue and Gold were finally able to get a decent number of goals in the game against Notre Dame but, as the rest of their season went, the team still couldn't win a game.\nAn additional difficulty the team had was the lack of a full-time coach. Art Schinner provided some guidance, but the team was mostly run by the players themselves.

The race is one leg of the American Triple Crown and is held annually at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The Preakness Stakes is traditionally held on the third Saturday in May, two weeks after the Kentucky Derby. The 2021 Preakness took place on May 15 with an actual start time of 6:54 p.m. EDT, with television coverage by NBC. The race was won by Rombauer.\nBackground.\nDue to effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition was run outside of its normal May schedule, contested as the final leg of the Triple Crown on October 3, without spectators. In late March 2021, organizers announced that attendance at the 2021 Preakness would be limited to 10,000. The 2021 Triple Crown races returned to their traditional sequence and schedule, with Medina Spirit winning the 2021 Kentucky Derby on May 1.\nField.\nSoon after the Derby, trainer Bob Baffert confirmed that Medina Spirit would be entered in the Preakness. However, it was later announced that Medina Spirit had tested positive for betamethasone, a corticosteroid, following the Derby, and stands to be disqualified if the split sample confirms the positive. Pimlico agreed to accept the entry of Medina Spirit on the condition that he undergo blood testing, monitoring, and a review of medical records prior to the Preakness; conditions that Medina Spirit met successfully.\nIn the first week of May, trainer Brad Cox stated that Mandaloun, who had finished second in the Derby and stood to be declared the winner upon a disqualification of Medina Spirit, would bypass the Preakness. Essential Quality, who had been the favorite in the Derby before finishing fourth, was also ruled out of the Preakness. In their absence, the main rival to Medina Spirit was expected to be his stablemate, Concert Tour, who had won two stakes races but finished third in his most recent start in the Arkansas Derby. Midnight Bourbon was expected to be the third betting choice based on his sixth place finish in the Derby, second place finish in the Louisiana Derby and win in the Lecomte Stakes.\nThe post-position draw was held on May 11. At the time the race was run, the top betting favorites were Medina Spirit, Midnight Bourbon, and Concert Tour in that order.\nAt post time, Midnight Bourbon and Medina Spirit went off as co-betting favorites each at 5-2.\nResult.\nSource:\nPayout.\nSource:\nTimes: mile – 0:23.77; mile – 0:46.93; mile – 1:10.97; mile – 1:34.78; final – 1:53.62.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:23.77) (:23.16) (:24.04) (:23.81) (:18.84 for final )"

Historically, the trials were held in April several months before the Olympics were held. This will be now changed to follow the American model where the trials are held six weeks before. The 2021 Australian Swimming Trials were then held at the South Australia Aquatic and Leisure Centre from 12 to 17 June and will be selection trials for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nWith the 2020 Australian Championships cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Swimming Australia released the 2021 swimming competition calendar in July 2020. In September 2020, it was announced that Gold Coast would be hosting the event. This meet followed the structure of the Olympic program with heats in the evenings and finals in the morning. This follows the prescient set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics where broadcaster NBC demanded this change so that the finals will be shown on primetime in the United States.\nThe event was held in a 10-lane pool with 10 lanes being used. This meant that two non-Australian swimmers could progress through the final. With the exception of the distance events, the heats were swum in reverse order with the fastest seeded heat first. Three finals for each event were held – men's 18–19 years, men's 21–21 years, women's 17–18 years, women's 19–20 years and men's and women's open.\nThere were no major withdrawals from the event with the exception of 2016 Olympian Georgia Bohl who pulled out due to a knee injury. During the Day 2 heats session, Mitch Larkin was disqualified in the heats of the 100 metre backstroke for a false start. Kyle Chalmers won the 50, 100 and 200 metre freestyle events, defending his titles from 2019. By taking out the 50 metre butterfly event, Holly Barratt at the age of 33 became the oldest female Australian champion eclipsing the silver medallist from the 1912 Olympics Mina Wylie. Singer, songwriter Cody Simpson made his return to competitive swimming, reaching the final of the 50 metre butterfly event.\nSchedule.\nM = Morning session, E = Evening session\nMedal winners.\nThe medallist for the open events are below.\nMixed events.\nLegend: \nRecords broken.\nDuring the 2021 Australian Swimming Championships the following records were set.\nClub points scores.\nThe final club point scores are below. Note: Only the top ten clubs are listed.\nBroadcast.\nFollowing the delay of the Olympic trials by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Seven Network agreed to terminate their broadcast partnership with Swimming Australia in October 2020. The deal was announced in September 2015 and had an option to extend to 2025. In February 2021, it was announced the Amazon Prime Video had secured an exclusive, two-year live broadcast streaming deal with Swimming Australia. Both the evening heat sessions and morning final sessions were streamed live on Prime Video and on Swimming Australia's digital platform SwimTV.

Murenzi replaced Aimable Bayingana, who resigned earlier that month due to allegations of corruption and sexual abuse, and will serve out the remaining two years of Bayingana's term before being able to seek reelection for a full four-year term.\nOrganization.\nThe FERWACY management committee consists of the president, two vice-presidents, a general secretary, a treasurer and three advisors, all of which are elected positions.\nEvents and Programs.\nProfessional.\nAs the national governing body of cycling in Rwanda, the Rwanda Cycling Federation is in charge of hosting and organizing many professional cycling events around the country, with the biggest annual event being the Tour du Rwanda, which is a road cycling stage race that usually takes place in late February and draws out large crowds. It was first held in 1988, but it only became a professional event in 2009 when it was added to the UCI Africa Tour calendar as a category 2.1 event.\nThe Rwanda Cycling Federation has also hosted and organized the African Continental Road Cycling Championships in 2010 and 2018, as well as the African Continental Mountain Bike Championships in 2015. \nIn July 2018, UCI president David Lappartient, keen to grow the popularity of the sport of cycling in Africa, invited all 50 national federations that form the African Cycling Confederation to make bids to host the 2025 UCI Road World Championships. In September 2019, Rwanda and FERWACY submitted their official bid to host the event in Kigali, the capital and largest city. This bid was inspected by the UCI in May 2021 to determine if all the necessary requirements are met. At the 2021 UCI Road World Championships in late September, Rwanda was announced as the winning bid over Morocco, the only other major bid; as a result, Rwanda will become the first African country to host the championships.\nThe Rwanda Cycling Federation also manages the Rwandan national cycling team, which has often been invited to participate in UCI Africa Tour events like the Tour du Rwanda and La Tropicale Amissa Bongo, through the Africa Rising Cycling Center, which breeds both local talent and helps develop talent in other African countries.\nAmateur and Local.\nTo help promote and encourage cycling in Rwanda, where cycling has experienced a notable growth in recent times, the Rwanda Cycling Federation also hosts and organizes many amateur races and events. One notable event is the Rwanda Cycling Cup, a series of races that also includes the Rwandan National Road Race and Time Trial Championships, which are both open to professionals and amateurs. \nThere has also been major investment into the cycling tourism industry. Ride Rwanda, the biggest of these touring events, is an annual multi-day bike touring event open to the public that is held at the same time as the Tour du Rwanda. It allows participants to ride on some of the same roads and climbs used in that year's Tour du Rwanda just hours before the professional race.\nAs part of the Kigali City Master Plan 2050 and revised District Development Strategies, the Rwanda Cycling Federation, in conjunction with the United Nations and other national government organizations, have launched several initiatives to promote cycling commuterism in order to reduce emissions, increase sustainability, and ensure a cleaner environment. These measures include the construction and improvement of pedestrian footpaths and bike paths, the launch of GuraRide, a public bike-sharing program, and the UN Environment Programme's \"Share the Road\" Initiative in partnership with the Global Green Growth Institute."

        "title": "Boning (baseball)",
        "text": "Boning is the practice in American baseball of treating a baseball bat with a bone (typically a cattle femur). The bone is run repeatedly up and down the barrel of the bat. The practice has the benefit of slightly hardening the bat by compressing the surface wood cells, and also (in superstition) of boosting hitting on the grounds that bone and hide go together, thus bone attracts hide, and as the baseball is covered in hide it will be attracted to the boned bat. \nThe bone may be bolted to a fixed surface, the bat being moved over the bone rather than the other way around. Sometimes another stationary hard surface is used, or a bottle, as these are just as good at hardening the bat, although not imparting the superstitious benefit. \nAccording to some sources, a harder bat surface, having less \"give\", experiences less deformation, thus forcing more deformation onto the baseball. The ball, being softer than wood, deforms more, so more kinetic energy is absorbed by the deformation, giving a lower coefficient of restitution to the entire event, and thus less speed of the ball coming off the bat, although the practical effect may be small; see bouncing ball physics. Other sources claim the opposite effect, and no conclusive testing proving the matter either way has been conducted. In any case, bat weight, swing speed, pitch speed, and contact angle are more important factors.\nBoning is also held to lengthen bat life by reducing splintering.\nUnlike corking, boning is entirely legal under baseball rules. \nThrough most of the 20th century, the great majority of major league bats were made of ash wood. In 1997, maple wood bats were permitted in major league games, and became widely used in the 21st century, following the example of home run champion Bobby Bonds. Maple being harder than ash, there is less need for boning. Also, in the early and mid 20th century bats had little factory processing beyond lathing, while modern bats undergo more factory processing, often including hardening and polishing. Consequently, boning is less efficacious and somewhat less common than in the early and mid 20th century.\nSometimes, boning bats would be the duty of the batboy."

Marquette was suffering through yet another warm winter, preventing the team from getting any practice time throughout the season. During the winter break, coach Garry took part of the team up to Big Cedar Lake and won two games against amateur clubs on the same day. After the break ended the full roster of players headed to the lake and got their first real playing time together. A week later the team dominated the Janesville city team but the Hilltoppers were unable to take advantage of their success due to a complete lack of ice.\nEventually the team headed north at the beginning of February and played games on four consecutive days. The teamwork was a bit lacking but the Hilltoppers managed a draw in the first game before splitting a pair of games against Michigan Tech. The second game highlighted what Marquette could have been that season with a hat-trick from Finkbeiner and 36 saves from Thompson. After finishing the northern swing with two wins, the team returned home to find that winter had finally come to Milwaukee. The team played their only home game of the season against long-time rival Wisconsin and were then forced back onto the road when the ice began to melt.\nThe Hilltoppers won against a hand-picked team from Green Bay and DePere but could get no playing time before their final games at Ann Arbor. Michigan was a strong team that season, having won four of their previous five games, and overwhelmed the hamstrung Blue and Gold. The team was out of sorts in both games and were soundly defeated, putting an end to any possible claim they had for a championship. \"Ozzie\" Wettlaufer ended the season leading the team with 13 goals and 23 points.\nAfter the season, there was hope that the team would be able to continue but, after an even warmer winter for 1933–34, the entire season was cancelled and the program was mothballed.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Walter Donaldson won the title, defeating Alec Brown 20–11 in the final.\nTournament details.\nThe tournament was promoted by, and held at, the Albany Club in Savile Row, London, in 1946. The invited players were the eleven who were eliminated before the final in the 1946 World Snooker Championship, with the draw for the even being made on 21 June 1946 in the presence of players and representatives from the press and BBC. There was a prize fund of £500.\nThere were three first round matches each contested over two days as the best-of-21 , starting on 8 July 1946 when Conrad Stanbury played Alec Brown. Brown took a 7–3 lead, and won 13–8. The following week, Fred Davis defeated Sydney Lee 14–7. Lee, taking penicillin during the first session due to painful boils on his arm, had taken a 3–2 lead before Davis finished the first day 6–4 ahead.\n Stanley Newman and Fred Lawrence were level at 5–5 after the first day, with Newman winning 11–8 when the pair did not play the final two scheduled frames.\nIn the quarter-finals, Kingsley Kennerley received a bye when John Barrie withdrew due to illness. Donaldson led Herbert Holt 4–1 and 8–2, and progressed 14–7. Brown eliminated Willie Leigh 13–8 after the first day had finished at 5–5. Davis defeated Lawrence 14–7, after their first day had ended with Davis leading 6–4.\nBrown converted a 6–4 overnight lead into a 14–7 win over Kennerley in the first semi-final. Donaldson also had a 6–4 overnight lead in his semi-final, against Fred Davis, and also won 14–7.\nOn the first day of the final, played as the best-of-31 frames, Donaldson took an 8–2 lead over Brown. By the end of the second day, Donaldson had won the 16 frames he needed for victory, whilst Brown had won 4 frames. Donaldson compiled an 80 break on the last day and led 18–7 before the match concluded at 20–11.\nA further tournament, where handicaps were applied, was held at the Albany Club in 1950.

        "text": "The 2022 Major League Baseball season (MLB) was originally scheduled to begin on March 31 and end on October 2. The 2021–22 lockout caused the season to be delayed by one week, starting on April 7. The regular season ended on October 5. The start of the season was delayed by a lockout of players, which commenced on December 2, 2021, following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA). On March 10, 2022, MLB and the MLBPA reached a deal on a five-year CBA, with Opening Day being held on April 7 (delayed from its originally planned March 31), and a full 162-game schedule played. Under the new CBA, universal designated hitter was adopted, the postseason was expanded to 12 teams, and the regular season tie-breaker game was eliminated. In November 2021, the Cleveland Indians announced their new team name, the Cleveland Guardians. The 2022 MLB All-Star Game was held on July 19 and hosted by the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.\nLockout.\nOn December 2, 2021, MLB owners voted unanimously to enact a lockout upon the expiration of the 2016 collective bargaining agreement between the league and the players' union. Issues raised between the league and union involved compensation for young players, as well as limitations on tanking to receive higher selections in the MLB draft.\nThe 2021–22 lockout was the first MLB work stoppage since the 1994–95 strike. It instituted a transaction freeze, including the postponement of the major league portion of the Rule 5 draft. It would be the first year since 1920 to not have a major league phase of the Rule 5 draft, though the minor league phase will still go ahead as scheduled.\nOn March 10, 2022, almost 100 days after the beginning of the lockout, MLB and the MLBPA reached a deal on a new, five-year CBA. Players began reporting to training camps on March 11, spring training began on March 17, and Opening Day on April 7. The league planned to play a full, 162-game season, and games displaced by the delayed start have been rescheduled.\nChanges in the new CBA include a pre-arbitration bonus pool for eligible young players, increased minimum salaries (increasing from $700,000 to $780,000 over the length of the deal), a draft lottery to determine the top six selections in the draft, the establishment of an international draft, and the establishment of a Joint Competition Committee that, in 2023, will oversee the adoption of future rule changes (including base sizes and pitch clocks among others). The National League began adopting the designated hitter on a permanent basis, after having previously used it on a temporary basis during the shortened 2020 season, while the postseason will be expanded to 12 teams.\nSchedule.\nMajor League Baseball released its 2022 regular season schedule on August 4, 2021. As has been the case since 2013, all teams play their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games, play six or seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 interleague games.

        "text": "The 1927–28 Marquette Blue and Gold men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nThere was again quite a bit of change from last years' varsity team, including the \"Three Macs\" being reduced to two with George McTeer transferring to McGill University. Fortunately, the other two Macs stayed and spearheaded a season for the ages. At the end of the previous season, at the invitation of Minnesota's head coach Emil Iverson (the brother of Kay Iverson), Marquette joined with several other regional schools to form the Northern Intercollegiate Hockey Association. The group of 16 schools, included some members of the MIAC and two junior colleges. The organization was designed to codify rules under which the midwestern teams would play and give support to members by attempting to schedule one another where applicable. The 'major' universities included Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech, Minnesota and Wisconsin, all of the schools who participated for the regional intercollegiate championship. The result of their association was that Marquette was able to play an expansive schedule against other colleges and use their revamped lineup to great effect.\nThe Blue and Gold began the season with two overpowering games against a local amateur club. McFadyen and MacKenzie demonstrated that they had lost none of their speed and talent in the two games and the rest of the team was coming along as well. After another pair of wins over a second local club, Marquette played their first intercollegiate game of the season and escaped with a narrow victory over Wisconsin. The team had a long layoff before returning to the ice in late January and attending their second Wausau tournament. This time the hilltoppers won both games and prepared for the start of their Michigan road trip. The team played three games in three days, beginning with a relatively easy victory over Michigan State and then began to look tired in the two matches against Michigan. The Wolverines were not a good team that season, winning just 2 of 13 games, but they seemed to find their game against the Blue and Gold. Fortunately, Marquette was able to skate to victory in both games and returned home for a showdown against the powerhouse, Minnesota.\nThe Gophers were coming off of a bad series at Wisconsin and seemed lost playing near the Illinois border. They were routed by the Blue and Gold, keeping Marquette's record pristine and placing the hilltoppers firmly at the top of the league standings. After a second victory over Wisconsin a week later, Marquette was just one game away from capturing their first championship and they headed to Minneapolis at the end of the month with that goal in mind. Because Minnesota had two losses in league play, the Gophers would have to win both games against Marquette to surpass the Blue and Gold. In the first game, Marquette fought a much more even duel with the Maroons and, in front of 5,000 spectators, the game was a defensive battle throughout regulation. The teams were tied at one apiece going into overtime and it took until the second extra session for another goal to be scored. Minnesota was finally able to pull ahead and then tried to hold onto their lead (sudden death rules were not in effect) but McFadyen managed to even the score before time had expired and the game was declared a draw. The tie meant that Minnesota, who was 8–2–2 in league play, couldn't finish ahead of Marquette (6–0–1) so the Blue and Gold were guaranteed the Western Intercollegiate title. The Gophers got a bit of revenge in the final game, preventing Marquette from finishing with an undefeated record, but Iverson's team were Collegiate Champions.\nJohn Boman served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The first order of business was hiring a coach and the administration was advised to hire George Grady. \"Buck\" was a Canadian who had played collegiately at the University of Saskatchewan before serving in the military during World War I. After the war he began coaching hockey and was player/coach of a team in Chicago when he accepted the position.\nA team was quickly assembled with most players coming from the college of dental surgery. The first game was played against nearby Wisconsin and, though a loss, the team acquitted themselves well. The next two games versus Minnesota were the first home games for the Blue and Gold. Though they lost both, they were able to keep the score close against the Western Intercollegiate Champions. Marquette took that experience into the two final games against Wisconsin and were able to earn back-to-back ties. In the first of those two matches, tragedy nearly struck when goaltender Harold Garry collapsed during intermission. While he eventually recovered, Montagne was forced to take his place in goal.

The Blue and Gold began playing in 1922 and rose to the top of their field, twice winning the Western Intercollegiate Championship. As was common with many schools of the era, Marquette's team suffered with the vagaries of weather and a series of warm winters in the early 30s put the program in jeopardy. Unfortunately, this was also a period where funding was lacking due to the great depression and Marquette suspended their program in 1933. Many other schools were forced to stop playing under similar circumstances, however, most eventually restarted their programs.\nMarquette did rekindle their team in 1969 after a new rink was finished. However, the school never promoted the team above club status and the Golden Eagles remain at that level (as of 2021).\nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, Pts = Points\""

Most players from the previous year returned and this time the squad was able to get an early start on practice. There were some lineup changes, with the previous year's captain \"Red\" Collopy moving to center, swapping positions with Nic Carle. The moved worked to perfection in the first game as the Blue and Gold earned the program's first win. The next week they took on Minnesota and, while both games were 1-goal contests, they ended in favor of the Gophers. The team was able to stop every Maroon player except for Frank Pond, who scored all three goals for the visitors.\nThe next weekend, Marquette travelled to Culver, Indiana to play the local military academy, however, many of the regular players missed the train and the team was forced to play with a makeshift lineup. The hastily cobbled-together team had a lead late but surrendered two goals in the final three minutes and came up short.

It was founded by Cricket West Indies in 2013 to replace the Caribbean Twenty20 as the premier Twenty20 competition in the Caribbean. It is currently sponsored by Hero MotoCorp and consequently officially named the Hero CPL. The inaugural tournament was won by the Jamaica Tallawahs, who defeated the Guyana Amazon Warriors in the final.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first five-wicket haul was taken by Shakib Al Hasan of the Barbados Tridents against the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Steel on 3 August 2013. Shakib captured 6 wickets for 6 runs, which was also the best bowling figures in an innings by a player in this competition. The most recent five-wicket haul was taken by Mohammad Nabi of the St Lucia Zouks against the St Kitts and Nevis Patriots on 27 August 2020. Sohail Tanvir's fifer for 3 runs was the most economical five-wicket haul, who picked up five wickets with an economy rate of 0.75 and bowling average of 0.60, against the Barbados Tridents, on 29 August 2017. David Wiese of the Guyana Amazon Warriors took the least economical five-wicket haul, bowling at an economic rate of 7.50. Among the West Indians, Fidel Edwards of the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Steel was the first bowler to pick up a five-wicket haul in this tournament.\nShakib Al Hasan is also the youngest player to claim a five-wicket haul in this competition, when he bagged a five-for the first time in the CPL, at the age of 26. On the other hand, on 26 September 2019, Hayden Walsh Jr. became the youngest native player to pick up a five-wicket haul in the Caribbean Premier League, when he claimed 5 wickets for 15 runs, at the age of 27.\nThe 2013 season and 2015 season saw the highest number of five-wicket hauls in a season. Two five-wicket hauls were taken in each of those seasons. No bowler could take a five-for in the 2014 and 2016 seasons. Dwayne Bravo is the only player to take a five-wicket haul while captaining his side. Bravo captained the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Red Steel, and picked up 5 wickets for 23 runs, on 24 July 2015 against the Jamaica Tallawahs."

        "title": "2020–21 UMass Minutemen ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2020–21 UMass Minutemen ice hockey season was the 89th season of play for the program, the 31st season competing at the Division I level, and the 27th season in the Hockey East conference. The Minutemen represented the University of Massachusetts Amherst and were coached by Greg Carvel, in his 5th season. UMass won the first national championship in program history.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Massachusetts' players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nRegular season.\nDespite high hopes, UMass got off to a rocky start. After winning their opening weekend, the Minutemen were swept by Boston College in a battle of top-10 teams. While the Maroon offense scored in both games, it was their goalies, who were normally stout in net, that let them down. The losses, however, weren't too damaging as BC was ranked #2 at the time and the team had plenty of time to recover. Unfortunately, the very next weekend the team could only manage a split with Merrimack. The Warriors were one of the league's worst teams (at least by reputation) and when the Minutemen could only manage a single shot on goal during the third period, they looked bad. The game was also marked by an odd occurrence; UMass typically rotated their starting goalies, having Matt Murray and Filip Lindberg alternate starts, which had happened in the first two weeks. However, Murray had started both games against Merrimack. When it happened again after a week off, Greg Carvel admitted that Lindberg had been injured and would be out for several weeks.\nIn the offseason, the coaches, in conjunction with both starting goalies, had agreed that it was time for one of the two to become the primary starter. The rotation at the start was supposed to be a way to determine which player would get the starring role but Lindberg's injury decided for the team. Murray got his shot in goal and won seven consecutive games in December and January. The run included three shutouts and the team was ranked near the top of the Hockey East standings. After the loss to Merrimack, the offense had also recovered; the team scored at least 4 goals in each game during Murray's winning streak. One of the biggest surprises was Carson Gicewicz, who scored 7 goals in that span, and nearly tied his career high in goals after just 12 games. Gicewicz had transferred from St. Lawrence, and was finally able to play for Carvel, who had recruited Gicewicz originally.\nMurray's and Massachusetts' winning streak came crashing to an end in mid January. Boston University, who had played just 2 games to that point due to COVID-19, swept the Minutemen in consecutive games, scoring 4 goals in each outing. To make matters worse, they did so while being outshot by at least 15 goals in both games. The two poor efforts gave Lindberg, who had recovered by that point, a chance to earn the starting role. Less than a week later Lindberg was in net and shut out Providence and allow just one goal in the second game. The team could only earn ties since the offense had gone dormant, but the sterling performance set Lindberg in goal and he continued to pay dividends.\nThe next week the team faced its long-time rival Massachusetts–Lowell and swept the weekend. The Minutemen were able to win at the Tsongas Center for the first time in over a decade while Lindberg was named as the Hockey East defensive player of the week. Lindberg's 0.50 goals against average since returning left little doubt that he was the team's starting goaltender and, with him acting as a wall in the crease, the offense was able to return to life. Unfortunately, everything was put on pause for several weeks due to the coronavirus. Due to a growing number of cases on the Amherst campus, UMass paused all athletic programs for several weeks. This prevented the Minutemen from being able to improve their conference ranking and, due to Hockey East using a power index rather than winning percentage, the four losses to BC and BU left the team unable to rise higher than third in the conference.\nAfter a three-week layoff, UMass returned with a vengeance. The Minutemen poured it on in a 8–1 drubbing of Providence and then earned a hard-fought win over Boston College. The victories put them solidly in the top-10 for national rankings even with a disappointing effort against Maine to end the regular season. Massachusetts was essentially guaranteed a spot in the NCAA tournament but the Minutemen were determined to make a statement.\nHockey East tournament.\nAs the #3 seed, they opened the postseason against Northeastern and got off to a great start, scoring twice in the first 9 minutes. The Huskies were able to cut the lead in half in the second period but Lindberg allowed nothing afterwards and UMass skated to a 4–1 victory. They met Providence in the semifinal and the Friars were looking for revenge after the previous game. The game started with a flurry of goals, 3 in the opening 9 minutes, but it was Providence who took an early 2–1 lead. Zac Jones tied the game before the period was over and, after a wild first 20-minutes, UMass put the clamps on Providence. Bobby Trivigno scored early in the second and then the defense shone, allowing just 3 shots against in the period. Providence was forced to open up the game in the third but all that served to do was give UMass the chance to extend its lead and eventually win the game 5–2.\nThe win sent Massachusetts to just its second Hockey East championship game (the first since 2004) and they were facing a surprising Lowell squad that had defeated both BC and BU. The Lowell defense played a tremendous game in the final, limiting UMass to just 22 shots in the contest. Henry Welsch allowed 1 goal in the first and then shut the door on the Minutemen but Lindberg was perfect in the game, stopping all 16 shots and leading UMass to its first Hockey East Championship. This was the first conference title for the program since 1972, before the NCAA even used numerical divisions. Trivigno was named Tournament Most Valuable Player, leading the Minutemen with 6 points.\nNCAA tournament.\nEven with the Hockey East title, UMass was only able to jump up to 5th in NCAA selection committee's rankings and had to settle for a #2 seed in the tournament. The Minutemen began the tournament against Lake Superior State, who were making their first appearance in 25 years, but UMass wasn't about to give them a welcome return. After a mostly even first period, Massachusetts blew the game open in the second, outshooting the Lakers 18–7 and took a commanding 3–1 lead. After Jake Gaudet scored his second of the game in the third there was little hope for LSSU and UMass coasted to a 5–1 win. In the regional final, UMass was in control of the game from the start but Bemidji seeped up to the challenge for a time. Enter Carson Gicewicz, who opened the scoring on a penalty kill after the 14-minute mark and then tallied again before the end of the first. Gicewicz completed his hat-trick in the second, the only one in his collegiate career, and put the game out of reach for the Beavers. BSU tried to get back into the game but the UMass defense was too good and Lindberg earned his fourth shutout of the season.\nFrozen Four.\nMassachusetts headed to its second Frozen Four (the other coming in 2019) and were looking forward to a rematch with Minnesota Duluth. Just days prior to the game, the Minutemen lost 4 players due to COVID protocols; While Duluth would be without their backup goalie, UMass lost the services of their leading goal scorer, Gicewicz, and their starting goalie, Lindberg, as well as Jerry Harding and Henry Graham. Missing two star players were bad enough but the loss of Graham meant that the team was down to just a single goaltender on the roster. Zac Steigmeyer, a senior and assistant equipment manager, had played goalie in high school and was dragooned into service as an emergency backup. When the team made it onto the ice, they faced a very experienced team with a defense nearly as impressive as their own. The Bulldogs took over the game in sports, especially in the middle frame, but they were never able to distance themselves from the Minutemen. Zac Jones opened the scoring near the end of the first on the power play and then the team had to weather an offensive storm from UMD. Matt Murray hadn't played a game for two and a half months but his performance didn't show any rust. He allowed two goals but turned aside 36 shots, including everything in the third, to allow UMass to tie the game and send the match into overtime. In the extra session the Minutemen took control and carried the play for nearly the entire time. Umass fired 13 shots on goal, compared with UMD's 2, and it only seemed like a matter of time before they would break through. When Trivigno flew around the back of the net and slid the puck across the front of the goal for a Garrett Wait tap-in, the small but enthusiastic crowd erupted.\nNational Championship.\nAfter overcoming their biggest challenge of the season, UMass received good news; both Gicewicz and Lindberg tested negative for COVID and drove overnight to Pittsburgh so they could play in the championship game. The Minutemen were making their second consecutive appearance in the title match and faced St. Cloud State in their first championship appearance. UMass got off to a good start, getting a goal from Aaron Bohlinger to open the scoring, and then the two teams played a mostly defensive battle for the remainder of the first. While killing off a penalty, a UMass defender grabbed the puck out of the air and threw it into center ice. A penalty for delay-of-game could have been called but nothing was forthcoming, much to the displeasure of the St. Cloud bench. Just minutes later, Massachusetts scored their second goal of the game. Upon review, however, it appeared that the play was offside and that the goal would be disallowed. Fortunately for the Minutemen, the play was allowed to stand and their two-goal lead held. The controversial calls didn't take the fight out of St. Cloud, who quadrupled their shot total in the second, but when Philip Lagunov scored an astounding goal on the penalty kill, the game looked to be slipping away from the Huskies. Matthew Kessel's power play marker later in the period all but sealed the game and the two teams played a fairly pedestrian third period, ending with UMass up 5–0 to win the program's first national championship.\nTrivigno was named Tournament Most Outstanding Player, making up for having been suspended for the Championship game two years earlier. Filip Lindberg set an NCAA record with a 0.33 GAA in the tournament, breaking the single-tournament record of 0.50 held by several goaltenders including Parker Milner (2012), Tim Regan (1972) and Ken Dryden (1967).\nHenry Graham sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Vikings represent Portland State University in the NCAA's Big Sky Conference.\nPortland State began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1946. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Portland State's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2020–21 season."

Almendares, Habana and San Francisco Park took the names of Orientals, Red Sox, and White Sox, respectively.\nThe three teams played their games at the Oriental Park Racetrack, which was altered to host baseball for the season. However, the position of the stands far from the field, and the scheduling of morning games due to afternoon horse races, prevented large crowds.\nThe Orientals won the league with an 8–6 record, edging out the Red Sox and White Sox by 1.5 games."

        "text": " \nThe 2021–22 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Gonzaga University, located in Spokane, Washington, in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team, also unofficially nicknamed the \"Zags\", is led by head coach Mark Few, in his 23rd season as head coach. This is the Bulldogs' 18th season at the on-campus McCarthey Athletic Center and 42nd season as a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC). They finished the season 28-4, 13-1 in WCC Play to finish as WCC regular season champions. They defeated San Francisco and Saint Mary’s to be champions of the WCC tournament. They received the WCC’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Georgia State and Memphis to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Arkansas.\nPrevious season.\nIn a season limited due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Bulldogs finished the 2020–21 season 31–1 and 15–0 in WCC play to win the regular season championship. They defeated Saint Mary's and BYU in the WCC tournament to win the tournament championship and receive the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. It was their 22nd straight trip to the NCAA Tournament. The Zags became the first Division I men's team since Kentucky in 2015 to enter the NCAA Tournament without a loss. They received the No. 1 seed in the West region where they beat Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton, and USC to advance to the Final Four. There they defeated UCLA to become the first undefeated team to advance to the national championship game since Indiana State in 1979. The Bulldogs lost their first game of the season to Baylor in the championship game, denying the Bulldogs a perfect season.\nOffseason.\nPlayer departures.\nDue to COVID-19, the NCAA ruled in October 2020 that the 2020–21 season would not count against the eligibility of any basketball player, thus giving all players the option to return in 2021–22. This in turn meant that seniors in the 2020–21 season had to declare themselves eligible for the 2021 NBA draft.\nPreseason.\nMark Few arrest and suspension.\nOn September 6, 2021, head coach Mark Few was pulled over by police and arrested for driving under the influence in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Few refused sobriety tests on the scene, but was shown to have a blood alcohol level of .119 and .120 from breath tests, well over the legal limit of .08. Few later apologized for the incident and pled guilty to misdemeanor DUI. The school suspended Few for three games for his actions. However, the suspension notably included two exhibition games and the first game of the regular season, meaning he was able to coach the November 13 game against No. 5 Texas.\nPreseason rankings.\nGonzaga was a near-unanimous selection as the No. 1 team in the country in the preseason AP and Coaches poll.\nRoster.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition \n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=| WCC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA tournament\nSource"

        "text": "The 2021 UK Championship (officially the 2021 Cazoo UK Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 23 November to 5 December 2021 at the York Barbican, in York, England. The event was the first Triple Crown and fifth ranking event of the 2021–22 snooker season. The tournament featured a prize fund of £1,009,000, with the winner receiving £200,000. It was sponsored by car retail company Cazoo and broadcast in the UK by the BBC and Eurosport.\nNeil Robertson was the defending champion, having defeated Judd Trump 10–9 in the 2020 final, but he lost 2–6 in the first round to amateur John Astley. Many other top seeds exited the tournament in the early rounds, with 11 of the world's top 13 ranked players eliminated before the last-16 stage. For the first time in the tournament's history, no top-16 player reached the final, which was contested between China's Zhao Xintong and Belgium's Luca Brecel, both of whom made their first appearances in a Triple Crown final. Zhao won the event with a 10–5 victory in the final to claim his first ranking title. The event featured 119 century breaks, with Gary Wilson making the highest, his fourth career maximum break, in his first-round match against Ian Burns.\nAged 24, Zhao became the youngest winner of the UK Championship since Trump in 2011. He became the fourth non-British winner in the tournament's history, after Ireland's Patsy Fagan, China's Ding Junhui, and Australia's Robertson. He also became the fourth player from mainland China to win a ranking title, after Ding, Liang Wenbo and Yan Bingtao. His win enabled him to enter the top 16 for the first time and secure a place in the second Triple Crown event of the season, the 2022 Masters.\nOverview.\nThe 2021 UK Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 23 November to 5 December 2021 at the York Barbican, in York, England. The UK Championship was first held in 1977 as the United Kingdom Professional Snooker Championship, open to British residents only. At the 1984 event, it became a ranking tournament open to players of any nationality, which it has remained ever since. The event was the first Triple Crown tournament, and the fifth ranking event of the 2021–22 snooker season. There were 128 participants, 119 players from the World Snooker Tour, and 9 invited amateur players.\nThe defending champion was Neil Robertson, who defeated Judd Trump 10–9 in the previous year's final. The tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport, and shown on Eurosport in Europe. Worldwide, the event was covered by China Central Television and Superstars Online in China, and by Sky Sport in New Zealand. It was simulcast in Hong Kong by Now TV; DAZN covered the event across Canada, Brazil and the United States. It was sponsored by vehicle rental company Cazoo.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nAll matches other than the final were held as the best-of-11 frames. In the first round, defending champion Neil Robertson lost 2–6 to amateur player John Astley, but later revealed that he had been diagnosed with pulsatile tinnitus and would have withdrawn from the tournament regardless. Shaun Murphy, the sixth seed, lost 5–6 to another amateur player Si Jiahui, and made comments afterward on BBC Radio 5 Live suggesting that amateur players should not be permitted to compete in professional events. Robertson, Mark Williams and Mark Selby agreed with Murphy's comments, although the World Snooker Tour stated that giving amateurs the opportunity to compete in professional tournaments was a vital aspect of their development, and its chairman Steve Dawson stated that the drama caused by amateur players beating elite professionals had been \"great for the sport\". Critics on social media noted the irony that Murphy himself had attempted to qualify for golf's 2019 Open Championship as an amateur competitor. Thepchaiya Un-Nooh compiled five century breaks while defeating Stephen Hendry 6–1 in the first round, becoming only the fourth player after Fergal O'Brien, Trump, and Matthew Selt to make that many in a best-of-11 match.\nReigning world champion Selby (seeded 2), Williams (9), Ding Junhui (10), and reigning Masters champion Yan Bingtao (12) all lost in the last 64. Selby trailed world number 63 Hossein Vafaei 0–5, but won the next two frames before Vafaei a in frame eight to win the match 6–2. Williams led world number 56 Anthony Hamilton 3–0, but lost the match 5–6, after which he apologised for falling asleep during the sixth frame, stating he had been feeling unwell following a case of COVID-19. Ding lost 3–6 to world number 55 Sam Craigie, guaranteeing that he would drop out of the top 16 after the tournament and be ineligible to compete in the Masters for the first time since 2006. After Craigie potted the final pink in frame eight, referee Maike Kesseler awarded him the frame for a 5–3 lead while the cue ball was still in motion. Craigie then placed his cue on the table and the cue ball collided with it. Speaking for the BBC studio, pundit Ken Doherty argued that the referee should have called a foul, respotted the pink, and given Ding the opportunity to come back to the table and attempt to level the match at 4–4; however, the frame had been awarded to Craigie prematurely. Speaking on Eurosport, pundit Alan McManus also criticised Kesseler for awarding the frame before the cue ball had come to rest. Yan lost 3–6 to world number 53 Ben Woollaston.\nFive more seeded players exited in the round of 32. Third seed Trump, the previous year's runner-up, suffered a shock 3–6 defeat to world number 35 Selt. John Higgins (7) and Mark Allen (11) fell victim to comebacks by their opponents, with Higgins losing 5–6 to Zhao Xintong after leading 5–3, and Allen losing 5–6 to David Gilbert after leading 5–2. Stephen Maguire (8) was whitewashed 0–6 by world number 40 Luca Brecel, while Stuart Bingham (13) lost 5–6 to world number 45 Noppon Saengkham, despite coming back from 0–5 behind to force a . Eleven of the world's top-13-ranked players were eliminated before the last-16 stage of the tournament. Overall, just five seeded players reached the last 16: Ronnie O'Sullivan (4), Kyren Wilson (5), Barry Hawkins (14), Jack Lisowski (15), and Anthony McGill (16). All five seeds progressed to the quarter-finals, along with Zhao, Brecel, and world number 102 Andy Hicks.\nIn the quarter-finals, Wilson defeated seven-time champion O'Sullivan. During their match, O'Sullivan repeatedly complained to referee Jan Verhaas about audience members distracting him as they entered and exited the auditorium, and interrupted his breaks to sit in his chair for several minutes at a time while the crowd settled down. He also requested that a photographer be removed from the arena floor. O'Sullivan came from 3–5 behind to level the match, but Wilson won the deciding frame for a 6–5 victory. The other quarter-finals were more one-sided as Brecel defeated McGill 6–2, Zhao won six consecutive frames to beat Lisowski 6–2, and Hawkins defeated Hicks 6–1. In the first semi-final, Brecel defeated Wilson 6–4, compiling four century breaks and three other breaks over 50, to become the first player from continental Europe to reach a Triple Crown final. In the second semi-final, Zhao defeated Hawkins 6–1, making a century break and an additional five breaks over 70, to reach his first ranking final.\nThe final was played on 5 December 2021 between Brecel and Zhao as the best-of-19 frames held over two . It was the first in the tournament’s history not to feature a player in the top 16 in the world rankings, and the second not to feature a player from the United Kingdom (Australian Robertson defeated Chinese player Liang Wenbo in the 2015 final). Zhao led 5–3 after the afternoon session, and then won five of the seven frames played in the evening session to defeat Brecel 10–5 and win the first ranking title of his career. Zhao became the tournament's fourth non-British winner, after Ireland’s Patsy Fagan, China's Ding, and Australia’s Robertson. He also became the fourth player from mainland China to win a ranking title, after Ding, Liang, and Yan. He moved up from 26th to ninth in the world rankings, which secured his place in the 2022 Masters in January. As runner-up, Brecel moved up the rankings from 40th to 18th.\nTournament draw.\nThe draw for the event is shown below. Players in bold denote match winners.\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 119 century breaks were made during the tournament. Gary Wilson made the highest, his fourth career maximum break, in his first-round match against Ian Burns."

The tournament, involving 64 teams, began on July 16 and concluded on August 3 with the championship game in Dayton, Ohio. The format of the tournament returned to that of the 2019 edition—64 teams, each playing in one of four regionals, with the top two teams from each regional progressing to the championship weekend. The tournament was won by Boeheim's Army, who captured the winner-take-all $1 million prize.\nFormat.\nFor its 2021 edition, The Basketball Tournament (TBT) returned to a 64-team format, with four regionals of 16 teams each (similar in format to the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament), and each regional being held at a single host site. The regional host sites and teams were revealed by TBT organizers on April 14, 2021. The tournament prize remained at $1 million. The teams and their regional placements were revealed in a selection special hosted by Seth Greenberg and Chris Vosters that aired on TBT's YouTube channel on June 21, 2021.\nAs with previous years, all tournament games operated with the \"Elam Ending\", a format of ending the game without use of a game clock. Under the Elam Ending, the clock is turned off at the first dead-ball whistle with under four minutes to play in the game. At that time, a target score, equal to the score of the leading team plus eight, is set, and the first team to reach this target score is declared the winner of the game. Thus, all games end on a made basket (field goal or free throw) and there is no overtime.\nThe first edition of a \"33-Point Contest\" was held between the two semifinal games—individual players competed to see who could make 11 three-point field goals the fastest. The contest, and prize of $33,333.33, was won by Omar Strong of team B1 Ballers.\nVenues.\nThe Basketball Tournament 2021 featured games in five locations: four regional sites plus one site for the championship weekend (four regional finals, two semifinal contests, and the championship game).\nTeams.\nKey: \nSource:\nTournament bracket.\nSource:\nSemifinals and championship.\nTelevision coverage via ESPN.\nAwards.\nSource: "

        "text": "The 2020–21 Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 77th season of play for the program and the 8th in the NCHC conference. The Bulldogs represented the University of Minnesota Duluth and were coached by Scott Sandelin, in his 21st season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Minnesota Duluth's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAlong with the rest of the NCHC, Minnesota Duluth began the year in Omaha, Nebraska. Duluth was forced to replace not only the best goaltender in the history of the program, Hunter Shepard, but three standout defensemen, including Hobey Baker Award-winning Scott Perunovich. Despite the talent drain, UMD started the season hot, going undefeated in their first 6 games. The team ran into a bit of trouble in the third week of December but still entered January ranked in the top-5. The Bulldogs began 2021 with 4 consecutive games against St. Cloud State and after winning the first match, dropped three straight to the Huskies. All of the games were close but the bad run allowed freshman Zach Stejskal to get a few turns in the starting role. Duluth recovered with three weeks against bad teams, winning 6 consecutive games, but was stymied by Western Michigan and limped to the end of the regular season. UMD ended up getting passed by St. Cloud in the final game and ended up 3rd in the conference.\nThe result of their finish was a meeting with Western Michigan in the conference tournament, and Minnesota Duluth had to overcome two separate leads by the Broncos to take the game in overtime. In the semifinal they faced St. Cloud State for the 7th time that season (1/4 of their games) and could never quite impose their will on the Huskies. UMD tied the game twice but the Bulldogs couldn't overcome St. Cloud's 3rd goal and fell in the semifinals. Fortunately, UMD was ranked in the top-10 and was essentially guaranteed a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\nMinnesota Duluth was ranked 9th by the selection committee and given a #3 seed. They were placed opposite Michigan but COVID-19 prevented their meeting. Due to Michigan's withdrawal, UMD's first tournament game would be against top-seeded North Dakota and the two ended up producing a game for the ages. UMD started Stejskal in goal and the plan looked to be the perfect choice early; Stejskal turned aside every UND shot in the first two periods and allowed the Bulldogs to take a 2-goal lead early in the third. North Dakota pulled their goalie with more than 2 minutes to play, trying to jump-start their offense and, miraculously, the tactic worked. The Fighting Hawks scored twice in the final 100 seconds and tied the game. The two teams continued to battle into overtime and UMD scored in the extra frame, only to see the goal waved-off due to offsides. More than 40 minutes later, UND almost ended the game when the puck hit Stejskal in the shoulder, deflected up and landed on top of the goal. In the 4th overtime, it looked like North Dakota had caught a break when Stejskal had to leave the game due to cramping but, fortunately for UMD, Ryan Fanti was more than capable of holding the fort. It took another period before the game finally saw the winning goal and freshman Luke Mylymok ended the match with just his second career goal. This was the longest game in the history of the NCAA tournament but was still more than 27 minutes shorter than the longest contest in NCAA history.\nThe win sent Minnesota Duluth into the Frozen Four for the 4th consecutive season (not counting the cancelled 2020 Tournament) and were joined by two other Minnesota teams. In the national semifinal, UMD faced Massachusetts in a rematch of the 2019 championship. Before the game began, UMD lost the serviced of Fanti due to COVID protocols but UMass would be without 4 players, including their starting goaltender and leading goal-scorer. Despite the disadvantage, the Minutemen hung in the game, keeping the score close while being outshout 36–15 in regulation. UMD was unable to get much past Matt Murray and had to settle for another overtime game with the score knotted at two apiece. In the extra session, Massachusetts came alive and skated rings around the Bulldogs. UMass fired 13 shots on goal, to UMD's 2 and were control most of the overtime. When Garrett Wait netted the winning goal it not only ended the Bulldogs' season but their 9-game winning streak in NCAA overtime games that stretched back to 1985.\nBrady Meyer and Ben Patt sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2021 Monaco Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2021) was a Formula One motor race held on 23 May 2021 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the Principality of Monaco. It was the fifth round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship, the 78th time that the Monaco Grand Prix was held, and the first time it had been held since after the round was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 78 lap race was won by Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing after polesitter Charles Leclerc of Ferrari failed to start the race with a driveshaft problem.\nBackground.\nThis race marked the 750th race start for the Williams team, and to celebrate the occasion, Williams placed the names of 100 Williams supporters on the halo of their car, the FW43B. McLaren also ran a special one-off Gulf Racing–inspired livery for the event, to celebrate their collaboration started in the 1960s.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4 and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium and soft respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nQualifying.\nCharles Leclerc qualified on pole despite crashing in the final minutes of Q3, whilst Max Verstappen joined him on the front row having qualified second, Valtteri Bottas shared the second row with Carlos Sainz having qualified third and fourth respectively. Lando Norris had his best qualifying result of the season and qualified fifth. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton had his worst qualifying since the 2018 German Grand Prix, and qualified outside the top two for the first time in 2021, qualifying seventh. Mick Schumacher was not able to participate in qualifying due to a heavy crash in the final practice session.\nRace.\nRace report.\nFerrari inspected Charles Leclerc's car overnight after his crash in qualifying. The primary concern was Leclerc's gearbox, but it was cleared, and it was expected that Leclerc would start on pole. On race day, Leclerc brought the car out from the pits on the reconnaissance lap out to the grid, and a failure in the left driveshaft was detected. There was not enough time to repair the problem before the race, and thus Leclerc did not start in the race. Ferrari later discovered the issue was caused by a cracked left-rear driveshaft hub.\nDue to Leclerc's failure to start the race, pole position on the grid was left empty, leaving Max Verstappen as the de facto polesitter, though he lined up in the second grid position. At the start of the race Valtteri Bottas got away slightly better than Verstappen, but the latter was able to cover off the former to take the lead into the first corner. Bottas later retired at his scheduled pitstop on lap 30, when his team was unable to remove his right front wheel due to a stripped wheel nut, promoting Carlos Sainz to second place and Lando Norris to third. \nVerstappen pitted for fresh tyres on lap 34. Sergio Pérez led most of lap 35 before being called into the pits at the end of the same lap, and this meant that Verstappen officially led all laps through the pit stops. Pérez used pit strategy to improve to fourth, which is where he finished the race. The podium was formed by the same drivers in those positions at the halfway point of the race: Verstappen in the lead, Sainz in second, and Norris in third. Pérez, in fourth, closed in on Norris but was unable to pass him before the race ended. Sebastian Vettel and Antonio Giovinazzi scored their first points of the season, finishing fifth for Aston Martin and 10th for Alfa Romeo, respectively. This was also Alfa Romeo's first point of the season. Lewis Hamilton, in seventh, used a late race tyre change to challenge for the race's fastest lap, earning one extra championship point.\nThree former Monaco Grand Prix winners, Kimi Räikkönen, Daniel Ricciardo, and Fernando Alonso, all finished one lap down on race winner Verstappen and out of the points in 11th, 12th and 13th places respectively. Verstappen's and Pérez's high points haul, along with Bottas' retirement and Hamilton's seventh-place finish, was sufficient to propel Red Bull into the lead in the Constructors' Championship, and Verstappen into the lead in the Drivers' Championship. This was the first time since the 2018 British Grand Prix that Mercedes had not led either championship. It was also the first time Verstappen was the points leader in his Formula One career. The FIA said it was open to suggesting layout changes for the future to the improve the on track excitement at the venue, after the race provided just one on-track overtake.\nPost-race.\nMercedes team boss, Toto Wolff admitted they had suffered a disastrous weekend. McLaren admitted it had not expected to be competitive enough for a podium result. In the aftermath of Leclerc's qualifying crash, FIA race director Michael Masi stated the FIA was looking into the possibility of introducing a rule where drivers who cause red flags in qualifying have their lap times deleted, to avoid the possibility of drivers crashing intentionally to prevent other drivers improving, though Masi said he was convinced Leclerc's qualifying crash was a genuine driver error. Télé Monte Carlo's broadcast direction was criticized after cutting away from Vettel's duel with Pierre Gasly on lap 32 to a replay of Lance Stroll hitting a kerb on the exit of the Piscine Pool. The video became an internet meme."

The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions are excluded from the rankings but their \"Interim\" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.\nIn addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, \"The Ring\" publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of \"The Ring\" is to crown a single champion for each division. Every single one of these lists are assembled by a committee but since the 90s, other parties have experimented with computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties. The most widely known computerized rankings are published by BoxRec and updated daily. The following is a list compiling the latest instalment of all the previously mentioned rankings."

        "text": "The 2020–21 Minnesota State Mavericks men's ice hockey season was the 52nd season of play for the program, the 25th at the Division I level and the 22nd in the WCHA conference. The Mavericks represented Minnesota State University, Mankato and were coached by Mike Hastings, in his 9th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Minnesota State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAfter missing out on a chance at postseason glory last year, Minnesota State didn't miss a beat and came into this year a house afire. The Mavericks won 9 of their first 11 games with Dryden McKay earning 6 shutouts. The second half of the regular season was nearly as outstanding as the first; MSU went 9–2 down the stretch and finished miles ahead of the second place team in the WCHA. With their record, the Mavericks were guaranteed a spot in the NCAA Tournament but could improve their ranking with a good performance in the conference tournament.\nAs the top seed, MSU played woeful Ferris State in the quarterfinals. The Mavericks' offense was quiet for much of the series but the defense was stout. Minnesota State surrendered one goal in two games and swept the Bulldogs. They faced an upstart Northern Michigan team in the semifinals and laid a complete egg. Northern Michigan scored the first five goals of the game, chasing McKay from the cage, and then played a defensive shell over the final 20 minutes to upset the Mavericks.\nLosing in the semifinal cost MSU the chance to earn a #1 seed and they dropped all the way to 6th in the rankings. The team had to face Quinnipiac in the opening game and got off to a bad start. The Bobcats scored twice in the first while MSU could only muster 6 shots. The Mavericks woke up in the second and cut the lead in half near the end of the period. The third saw the team having to kill off a lengthy 2-man advantage only to surrender a goal a couple of minutes later. MSU bore down and scored with more than 5 minutes to play but, as time ticked away, the team was forced to pull McKay for an extra attacker and Cade Borchardt tied the game with 62 seconds remaining. The game went into overtime and, just like they had been in the third, Minnesota State was the aggressor. The Mavericks continued to put pressure on the Quinnipiac net until Ryan Sandelin banged in a loose puck and won the game for the Mavericks.\nThe win was the first tournament victory for Minnesota State at the Division I level, snapping a 6-game losing streak. The last NCAA Tournament win for the program had come 30 years earlier when the school was still called 'Mankato State University'\nAfter the win, the team appeared to relax and played their next opponent, Minnesota, like the juggernaut they had been during the regular season. MSU held the Gophers, which had the #2 offense in the nation, to just 9 shots in the first two periods. The Mavericks scored twice in the opening frame and twice more in the third. McKay held the fort during Minnesota's attempted comeback in the final period but he surrendered nothing. The shutout was the 10th of the season for McKay, placing him just 2 behind Ryan Miller for the most in a career.\nMinnesota State advanced to its first Frozen Four as the highest remaining seed and faced former WCHA rival St. Cloud State in the semifinal. McKay wasn't sharp in the game, allowing 3 goals in the first 23 minutes, but MSU fought back and took a 4–3 lead early in the third. The Huskies tied the game for the fourth time mid-way through the period but neither team seemed able to finish the scoring in regulation. With less than a minute to play St. Cloud deflected a puck into the net and MSU was unable to earn a tying goal, ending their season.\nTanner Edwards and Evan Foss sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Polonnaruwa National Cricket Ground also known as either Polonnaruwa Cricket Ground or National Cricket Ground, Hingurakgoda is a cricket stadium in Hingurakgoda, Polonaruwa District, Sri Lanka. The ground was inaugurated on 6 April 2021 with incurring a cost of Rs. 130 million. The stadium is built as part of a large sports complex in the region.\nThe ground has been built on a 42/43 acre land which has boundary distance of 80 metres and set with 10 centre wickets. The ground was initiated as part of Sri Lanka Cricket's National Pathway Project which was commenced in 2016. The project was announced in the latter part of 2016. Then CEO of SLC Mohan de Silva revealed that SLC had allocated Rs. 100 million each for cricket stadiums to be built in Pollonaruwa and Jaffna. However, the construction of the stadium was delayed for several years due to the financial tussles and also due to the creative differences with the SLC interim committee. The tenders for establishing the ground was awarded in 2018. The construction of the ground finally took off in February 2019.\nIn May 2020, it was revealed that the opening ceremony of the ground had to be further delayed for months due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe initial estimated cost of the project was Rs. 130 million and the ground was partially completed in May 2020 with cost of Rs. 92 million.\nIn April 2021, COPE committee which summoned Sri Lanka Cricket for investigations also revealed that the SLC failed to seek approval from the Department of Archaeology in order to construct the sports complex and cricket stadium with spectators in Polonnaruwa."

        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is a baseball or softball fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. The position is mostly filled by defensive specialists, so shortstops are generally relatively poor batters who typically hit lower in the batting order. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\nAlthough there have been players with long careers at shortstop throughout major league history, they were more rare until the 1950s as expectations for their offensive contributions gradually increased. When batting expectations were lower, shortstops could be more easily replaced as their defensive ability declined by players with roughly equivalent hitting capability. 21 of the top 27 players in career games at shortstop made their major league debuts after 1950. Omar Vizquel is the all-time leader in games played as a shortstop, having played 2,709 games at the position in his career. 19 players in major league history have played over 2,000 career games at shortstop, the second most of all positions behind only first basemen."

        "text": "The Great Britain Women’s Rugby League tour of Australia in 1996 was the first such tour by a female British or English Rugby League team. Seven matches were played during the three-week tour, including three Test Matches. These were the first Rugby League internationals played by Great Britain or England women. For the host nation, Australia, this tour followed on from a visit by the New Zealand women’s rugby league team during the previous year, 1995.\nThe tour was successful for the team, with Great Britain winning six of the seven matches. The First Test Match was narrowly won by Australia, but Great Britain rallied to win the Second and Third Test Matches by small margins to claim a series victory.\nTeam Leadership.\nThe team was coached by Ian Harris with Jackie Sheldon as assistant coach. Nikki Carter was tour manager. Paula Clark served as the team’s physiotherapist.\nThe team was captained by Lisa McIntosh with vice-captain Brenda Dobek.\nSquad.\nA photo of the 1996 touring team is included with the Dobek interview on the Women in Rugby League website.\nResults.\n1st Test.\nDespite comprehensive victories to Great Britain in both tour games leading into the First Test Match, their inaugural meeting with Australia was tightly contested. \nGreat Britain scored the first try in the opening ten minutes, Sally Milburn touching down after a great pass from Allison Kitchin. The try was converted by Karen Burrows. The first half continued with the Great Britain dominating the attack, however, Alison Smith scored an unconverted try for Australia just prior to the break. \nAustralia’s attack was more effective in the second stanza. Fiona Huntington scored a try near the sideline within a few minutes of the resumption. Katrina Fanning then scored from a short run to the try-line, “hitting and spinning on the line to get the ball down.” With this try converted by Alison Smith, Australia lead 14–6. \nAllison Kitchen made a break for Great Britain, running down the left edge. Australian second-rower Danielle Meskell made an impressive covering tackle, however, the Lionesses spread the ball to the right wing for Jill Adams to score. \nThe “deceptively quick” British five-eighth, Brenda Dobek, instigated the next try, popping a pass to captain Lisa McIntosh, who found in support Chantelle Patrick, who scored in the corner. This unconverted try levelled the scores at 14–all with about five minutes to play. \nIn injury time, Australia was awarded a penalty for a swinging arm in the tackle. From about 25 metres out and to the right of the posts, Alison Smith kicked a penalty goal to win the match for Australia. \nThe \"Canberra Times\" recognised Alison Smith and Danielle Meskell as the best players for Australia, and for Great Britain, hooker Michelle Land and the halves-pairing of Mandy Green and Brenda Dobek. Great Britain's team award for their best player in the match went to Brenda Dobek. \n3rd Test.\nThe third and deciding Test was again a tussle between evenly matched teams. Great Britain had established a 12–4 lead at halftime, but Australia scored an early second half try. \nThe score was 20–18 in Great Britain’s favour towards the end of the match. The last three minutes saw Great Britain under pressure, defending their line against Australia’s attack. The defence held, to secure Great Britain a series victory. \nGreat Britain’s player of the match, Brenda Dobek, was also named player of the series. Sydney’s \"Daily Telegraph\" cited Danielle Meskell as Australia’s standout player. \nSources.\nStatistics for the Great Britain team drawn from a document supplied by the team’s coach. Point scorers for the First and Third Test verified by the contemporary match reports in the \"Canberra Times\" and \"Daily Telegraph\". \nCoverage of women’s rugby league in Australian newspapers in 1996 was limited, and the tour coincided with the 1996 Olympic Games. The \"Rugby League Week\", a magazine dedicated to the sport in Australia included an advanced mention of the Third Test’s location (Redfern Oval) and published only the result of the First Test. \nAccess to 1996 editions of Australian newspapers and the \"Rugby League Week\" is offline, through microfilm and actual copies held in the State Library of New South Wales."

There are 11 events: four bouldering, five lead, and two speed events. The season began on 16 April in Meiringen, Switzerland with the first bouldering competition in the season, and concluded on 4 September in Kranj, Slovenia. The International Federation of Sport Climbing had initially scheduled 18 events concluding on 31 October, but COVID-19 travel restrictions resulted in the cancellation of events in Xiamen and Wujiang in China, Jakarta in Indonesia and Seoul in South Korea.\nThis season was the first completed IFSC Climbing World Cup series since the 2019 edition, as the 2020 IFSC Climbing World Cup was limited to just one event, the Briançon Lead World Cup in August 2020, due to the pandemic. The opening event in Meiringen was the first Boulder World Cup since the 2019 season. The Boulder World Cup and the Boulder and Speed World Cup scheduled for 21–22 May and 28–30 May, respectively, in Salt Lake City, United States, were the first-ever consecutive IFSC World Cups held in the same city.\nThe top 3 in each competition receive medals, and the overall winners are awarded trophies. At the end of the season an overall ranking is determined based upon points, which athletes are awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.\nScheduling.\nIn December 2020, the IFSC moved the 21–22 May Boulder World Cup from Munich, Germany to Salt Lake City, United States, and rescheduled the already existing Boulder &amp; Speed World Cup in Salt Lake City from 11 to 13 June to 28–30 May, in order to minimize travel for athletes and staff. In March, the federation also moved the Seoul, South Korea and Wujiang, China World Cups from April and May to October because of ongoing COVID-19 related restrictions in the respective countries. In July, the Lead World Cup in Ljubljana, Slovenia was moved to Kranj, Slovenia, and rescheduled from 4–5 to 3–4 September.\nIn August, the federation cancelled the World Cups in China: the 15–17 October Lead &amp; Speed World Cup in Xiamen and the 22–24 October Boulder &amp; Speed World Cup in Wujiang. In September, the federation also cancelled the 30–31 October Speed World Cup in Jakarta, Indonesia, which had already been postponed from 23 to 24 October. The following week, the IFSC also cancelled the Boulder and Speed World Cup in Seoul, originally scheduled for May and pushed back to October, due to rising COVID-19 cases in South Korea. The cancellation of the Jakarta and Seoul World Cups mean the bouldering and speed seasons concluded in June in Innsbruck and Villars in July, respectively.\nCompetition highlights.\nBecause of the cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening World Cup event of 2021 Meiringen held 16–17 April 2021, was the first Boulder World Cup in 22 months, since Vail, Colorado in September 2019., and the first Climbing World Cup of any discipline since August 2020 in Briançon. Adam Ondra won the men's gold, his 20th career World Cup medal, with 3 tops in the final. On the women's side, Slovenia's Janja Garnbret continued her winning run from her unbeaten 2019 bouldering campaign, winning the competition by topping all boulders with just four falls while 16-year-old French climber Oriane Bertone made her senior competition debut with a second-place finish behind Garnbret.\nGarnbret did not participate in the first of two World Cups in Salt Lake City held 21–22 May, bringing her streak of seven Boulder World Cup wins to an end. In her absence, Grossman won the gold, followed by Bertone, who again finished second, while Ondra repeated as the men's Boulder winner. Grossman repeated as the winner in the second Salt Lake City event, held 28–30 May, this time becoming the first woman to defeat Garnbret, who finished second, since April 2018. In the men's speed competition, Kiromal Katibin of Indonesia set a world record time of 5.258 seconds in qualifying, a record that was broken the same day by fellow Indonesian, Veddriq Leonardo, who hit the buzzer at 5.20 in the final run against Katibin.\nGarnbret won all three Lead World Cups she entered in 2021, winning a record 31st World Cup gold medal in Kranj in September and taking the overall season title. On the men's side, Stefano Ghisolfi took the Lead season title, having won the event in Briançon in addition to two second places at the World Cups in Innsbruck and Chamonix, while Sean Bailey's two wins in Villars and Chamonix earned him second place in the overall Lead season ranking.\nBroadcast incident.\nAustrian broadcaster Osterreichischer Rundfunk (ORF) issued an apology during the Innsbruck World Cup, after showing slow-motion, close-up footage that zoomed on the chalk handprints on Johanna Färber's bottom on the event's live feed on YouTube. IFSC removed the video from its YouTube channel and replaced it a version without the footage. Färber later posted a message on her Instagram, calling the incident \"disrespectful and upsetting\"\nBouldering.\nThe overall ranking is determined based upon points, which athletes are awarded for finishing in the top 30 of each individual event.

The RedHawks represented Miami University and were coached by Chris Bergeron, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Miami's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nMiami, along with several other NCHC teams, began the season in Omaha, Nebraska and played a sizable number of games in December. In an effort to create a pseudo-bubble and protect the teams from COVID-19, the RedHawks played 10 games over a three-week period. Miami began with a goalie rotation, having Ben Kraws and Ludvid Persson alternating starts, but by the end of the month, the team had settled on Persson as their starting netminder. At the beginning of January the team sat near the bottom of the conference, winning just two of those ten games. When play returned to home campus sites, there was a brief glimmer of hope for the RedHawks as the team won back-to-back games at Western Michigan but then the bottom dropped out. Miami played just three teams the rest of the regular season and ended up losing 10 of their final 12 games. Miami finished last in the NCHC and were easily bounced from the conference tournament. The only saving grace for the program was Persson's performance which could help the team moving forward.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

In each of his three year with the program, Roth was the team's leading scorer, but it was during his junior season that he became a Crimson legend. In that season's Beanpot tournament, Roth scored the overtime goal in the championship game, winning the program's first title in six years. He continued to play well throughout the season and helped the Crimson finish second in both the regular season and the ECAC tournament. He was named ECAC Player of the Year and to the All-American team. Roth helped Harvard score 10 goals in the NCAA Tournament but the team still managed to lose both of their games.\nFor his senior season, Roth was named team captain and led Harvard to the top of the ECAC standings. Harvard lost just once in 20 conference games and ran through the first two round of the ECAC tournament but the team was stymied again in the title game. Harvard made a second consecutive trip to the NCAA Tournament and Roth helped the team record 9 goals in 2 games, but the defense was rather porous, allowing 16 scored and Harvard again finished in 4th place.\nAfter graduating, Roth played two seasons of senior hockey before ending his career. When he graduated, Roth was Harvard 4th all-time leading scorer and his exploits were remembered. He was inducted into the Harvard Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Beanpot Hall of Fame in 2000."

        "text": "Steven A. Smith (born 1962) is a Canadian ice hockey scout and former center who was an All-American for Colgate.\nCareer.\nSmith played junior hockey in his home town of Peterborough. Despite spending 5 games with the Peterborough Petes, he retained his college eligibility and began attending Colgate university in the fall of 1980. Smith arrived just as the Red Raiders were becoming a good team and helped the program post its first ever 20-win season. Smith was a major contributor that season, finishing 3rd in team scoring and would continue his high offensive production for his entire college career.\nAfter the auspicious debut, the team declined a bit and Smith would never reach a second NCAA Tournament but he was counted on to lead the team. He was named team captain as a junior and held the role for two seasons, managing to lift the team to a second 20-win season in 1984. That Year he was named as an All-American but the team was middle-of-the-pack in ECAC Hockey and lost to a very strong Rensselaer squad in the ECAC Tournament. Despite the lack of playoff success, Smith finished his career as the all time leader for assists and points for the program and was the first Raider to top 200 points for a career. He was eventually surpassed in points but still sits second (first in points per game) as of 2021.\nAfter graduating, Smith continued his playing career in Europe, first with HC Varese. A stellar season led to him signing with SaiPa but his results in SM-liiga weren't as impressive. He returned to the Italy, playing for new entry, SV Ritten. After helping the club stave off relegation once, he was unable to accomplish the feat a second time and retired after the team was demoted to Series B in 1988.\nAfter he was inducted into the Colgate Ring of Honor, Smith became an assistant coach for the Petes in 1997. After six years he left to take over as head coach for the Windsor Spitfires in 2003 (with Mike Kelly). Smith lasted just one season before resigning and then became a scout for the New Jersey Devils after the NHL returned from the lockout, a role he continues with as of 2021."

The Mavericks represented the University of Nebraska Omaha and were coached by Mike Gabinet, in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Omaha's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDue to ongoing COVID-19 concerns, The entire NCHC conference began the season playing in Omaha, Nebraska. Despite playing all of these game in their home building, the Mavericks didn't officially play a home game in December. All games were considered 'neutral site' matches but Omaha was still able to use the familiar surroundings to get off to a good start. It took the Mavs a few games to get used to the compressed schedule but, by the end of the third week of play, the team had shot up into the middle of the top-20 rankings. UNO would hover around that point for the remainder of the regular season and, despite losing 3 out of 4 to North Dakota at the end, Omaha was projected to make the NCAA Tournament under normal circumstances.\nWhen their conference tournament began, Omaha was hoping it could at least improve its standing and get a better matchup in late March. However, the team was outplayed by Denver for most of the contest and lost the quarterfinal 4–5. As a result, Omaha was ranked 14th by the selection committee and placed opposite to Minnesota in the regional semifinals. The Mavericks never really were in the game, surrendering the first three goals before ending the first down 1–3. The Gophers scored an additional trio in the second and then skated to a rather easy 7–2 win over Omaha.\nJacob Zab sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

They represented Western Michigan University in the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 8th season in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). The Broncos were coached by Andy Murray, in his 10th season, and played their home games at Lawson Arena.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Western Michigan's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nWestern Michigan began the season playing a series of games in Omaha, Nebraska, along with the rest of the NCHC. Before the team could even finish its first game, the Broncos were hamstrung by an injury to their starting netminder, Brandon Bussi. The team turned to senior Austin Cain and, after a very rough start, he settled into the starting role. Cain played well at times but the team's compact schedule of games gave WMU few favors and by Christmas the team sat near the bottom of the conference with a 2–6–2 record. After getting swept by Miami at the beginning of January, freshman Alex Aslanidis was put in net and the team began to show signs of life. After nearly returning the favor to Miami, the Broncos swept #4 St. Cloud State and turned their season around virtually overnight. Aslanidis' performance, paired with the stellar play of Ronnie Attard, allowed Western Michigan to sweep another #4 team a few weeks later (Minnesota Duluth). In their final weekend of the regular season Bussi returned from his injury and swept Miami to put the team within one game of a .500 record.\nDespite the teams vastly improved performance in the second half of the season, their record meant that the team had no real chance of making the NCAA Tournament without winning the NCHC Championship. The team had to get through Minnesota Duluth in the quarterfinals and the Broncos gave everything they had, taking a lead into the third period and then tying the game with less than a minute to play. WMU nearly matched UMD shot-for-shot but the final goal came from the Bulldogs and Western Michigan's season was over.\nJacob Bauer, Rhett Kingston and Jared Kucharek sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#6C4023; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#6C4023; \" | "

The Friars represented Providence College and were coached by Nate Leaman, in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Providence's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nProvidence got off to a bad start, surrendering 12 goals in their opening weekend to Boston College. Afterwards, sophomore transfer Jaxson Stauber, son of Hobey Baker-recipient Robb Stauber, took over in net and the team saw immediate improvement. The Friars were able to remain in the top-20 for the remainder of the season but the team was never able to put a consistent string of wins together to get them either into the top-10 or among the best teams in their own conference.\nBy the end of the regular season Providence was considered a 'bubble team' for the NCAA Tournament and would need a very good performance in the Hockey East Tournament to improve their standing if they couldn't get an automatic bid. The first impediment for the team was Hockey East using a power index to decide conference placement rather than win percentage. This meant that Providence finished below Connecticut despite possessing a better record and would have to play a road game in the quarterfinals. The team was easily able to overcome that difficulty and defeated the Huskies 6–1. Their next opponent, Massachusetts, was not as easily beaten. After a good start, Providence was shut out over the final 50 minutes of play and lost 2–5.\nGetting into the semifinal and losing to the eventual conference champion was a solid performance but Providence had a problem. Because there were little-to-no non-conference games for all of college hockey, the PairWise rankings would not be used. Instead, the NCAA selection committee decided to judge teams based upon how they performed against the best teams in their conference. Providence had lost both games to BC, gone 1–1 versus Boston University and 0–2–2 against Massachusetts (including the playoff match). This left the Friars with a 1–5–2 record against the 'good' Hockey East teams, which was not sufficient to earn them a trip to the national tournament.\nKyle Koopman and Jimmy Scannell sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The Lakers represented Lake Superior State University and were coached by Damon Whitten, in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Lake Superior State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nAfter a poor season the year before, Lake Superior saw a great deal of roster turnover. At the start of the season the altered lineup seemed to be performing well; the team lost just once in their first ten games, though the strength of their opposition (or lack thereof) did contribute to their record. Their schedule was part of the reason why the Lakers were ranked 19th when they began conference play and, due to casing the WCHA's top team, they swiftly found themselves outside the top-20. Lake Superior didn't go away, however; the team flirted with the ranking for the remainder of the regular season. The Lakers ended with a much-improved record of 15–6–3, mostly on the strength of senior netminder Mareks Mitens and receiving 170 fewer penalty minutes than the year before (which averaged to about 1 fewer power play against every other game). With both the team's offense and defense playing better than it had in years, the Lakers finished tied for second in the WCHA, the best result for LSSU since 1996.\nEven with their record and finish, the Lakers were still ranked outside the top 15 and needed a good performance in the WCHA tournament to get into the conversation. As the second seed, the Lakers began at home against Alabama–Huntsville and dispatched the Chargers fairly easily. In the semifinals, Lake Superior took on Bemidji State with their season on the line and the defense completely shut down the Beavers. Lake State scored the first four goals of the game and Mitens didn't surrender a single goal until 4 minutes remained, even then it only came on a BSU power play with their goalie pulled. The Lakers received a gift by facing 6th-seeded Northern Michigan for the championship. Lake Superior took full advantage by against scoring the first four goals and then coasted to a 6–3 win. it was the program's first conference title since 1995 and the automatic bid allowed the Lakers into the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1996.\nLake Superior received a 3-seed and were set opposite Massachusetts. Unfortunately, the Minutemen were the hottest team in the country, not having lost a game since mid-January, and it showed from the very start. UMass was the aggressor, scoring first, and despite a tying goal by Lake State at the end of the first the Lakers looked like they were following the play. UMass broke the game open in the second, outshooting LSSU 18–7 and scoring twice to take the lead. The Lakers picked up their game in the third but the oppressive defense by Massachusetts prevented Lake Superior from denting the twine and two more goals against put the game out of reach. Even with poor finish, this season can't be considered anything but a resounding success for the Lakers.\nNiko Esposito-Selivanov sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

It is located south of Tsui Ping Estate and is close to Kwun Tong and Lam Tin stations. Currently, it is managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong Government. Covering an area of about 23,038 m2, there are multiple outdoor indoor swimming pool facilities, which provide residents in the district with all-day indoor and outdoor swimming venues. It is also a popular choice for residents of East Kowloon to learn to swim.\nHistory.\nThe old Kwun Tong Swimming Pool, built and originally managed by the Urban Council, opened on 25 July 1971. The Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club donated HK$5,410,000 toward the construction of the swimming complex, which was located immediately north of the current pool. It was formally opened on 30 October 1971 by Princess Anne.\nIn 2000, the Urban Council was disbanded by the government, and management of the swimming pool became the responsibility of the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).\nThe government proposed in 2002 to build the Kwun Tong Town Hall and rebuild the Kwun Tong Swimming Pool on the original swimming pool site, but this plan was shelved in 2006.\nThe Leisure and Cultural Services Department applied for funding in 2009 to build a new Kwun Tong swimming pool on the old site of the Kwun Tong Recreation Ground Football Field, which was constructed by Gammon Construction and was opened on 1 April 2013. It was officially opened by the late Florence Hui on 26 October 2013."

Former Philippine Basketball Association chairman, Shell executive, and San Sebastian alumnus Rey Gamboa graced as the guest of honor. Basketball Association of the Philippines secretary-general Graham Lim served as the season's commissioner. The theme of the season is \"NCAA at 79: A Family Through Time.\" Games then are subsequently held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum and covered by ABS-CBN Sports via Studio 23.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nSemifinals.\nLetran and San Sebastian have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) Letran vs. (4) Mapua.\nTrailing by five points at the half, the Knights took a 7-0 run led by Ronjay Enrile at the start of third quarter. Boyet Bautista then drew a series of fouls and made four straight points from the charity stripe to give the Knights their biggest lead, 56-50. The Cardinals, thanks to Christian Guevarra's three-point play, tried to tie the game at 60-all with four minutes remaining in the game. But the Knights turn to Jonathan Aldave, who scored 10 of his 13 points in the final canto, sealing the win.\n(2) San Sebastian vs. (3) JRU.\nThe Stags used an explosive run in the third quarter to put the Heavy Bombers for good. San Sebastian's Redentor Vicente led the Stags with 19 points, including eight straight in a 10-0 run in the third quarter and gave San Sebastian its biggest lead, 62-53.\nFinals.\nThis is the continuation of the San Sebastian–Letran rivalry. The last time they met in the Finals was in 1998, where Letran swept San Sebastian, 2-0, en route to the championship. The two-time defending champions Stags are in their fourth-consecutive Finals appearance since 2000. The Stags are mentored by Arturo Valenzona, who authored the Stags' first four of the five straight championships in 1993 to 1997 and added two more from 2001 to 2002. The Knights, on the other hand, won its last championship in 1999 under Binky Favis, are again led by Louie Alas, who gave Letran its 13th title in 1998.\nLetran came out in the first game with a barrage from the start of Game 1, even posting a 22-point outing in the third quarter, 59-37. Ronjay Enrile finished with 21 points, helping Letran to lead the series 1-0.\nTied at 71-all in the last three minutes of Game 2, the Stags gunned the Knights down with a 11-2 decisive run, thanks to Christian Baluyot's bail out three-pointer. Redentor Vicente and season MVP Leo Najorda put up the finishing touches to gave San Sebastian the win and extended the series.\nLetran led San Sebastian by 11 points, 38-27, before halftime of Game 3, thanks to Aaron Aban's scoring during a 17-3 run. After Boyet Bautista tied the game, 58-all, in the last two minutes of the game, Jonathan Pinera and Aaron Aban made back-to-back clutch hits, as the Stags bungled all their chances to even the game and gave the Knights its 14th championship. Ronjay Enrile scored 19 points and was named Finals MVP.\nJuniors' tournament.\nStepladder semifinals.\nAll games were single-elimination.\nFinals.\nSince San Beda swept the elimination round, they have a twice-to-beat advantage over Mapúa. This is a de facto best of three series with San Beda automatically leading 1-0. Therefore, San Beda has to win once, while Mapúa needed twice, to win the championship.\nRed Cubs team captain Ogie Menor, who finished with a double-double, went scoreless in the final period. But teammate James Martinez erupted for a 3-of-5 treys in the fourth quarter, and hit a 14-footer to break a 70-all deadlock with 12 seconds left in the game. Jay-R Taganas got fouled by Juan Tabaquero, then nailed two charities to seal the championship."

After Pinturault won the seventh giant slalom of the season (his third giant slalom victory in 2020; no one else had two), prior discipline leader Žan Kranjec of Slovenia dropped into fourth place, and Kristofferson (who finished third) was clinging to a six-point lead for the discipline championship over Pinturault with two races to go. \nHowever, first the World Cup finals scheduled for Cortina d'Ampezzo were cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, and then the races scheduled in Kranjska Gora were also cancelled by the pandemic. The cancellations handed the season title in giant slalom (as well as the title in slalom) to Kristoffersen without the expected showdown.\nStandings.\nUpdated at 21 March 2020 after all events."

        "title": "Congaree Golf Club",
        "text": "Congaree is a private golf course in the eastern United States, located in South Carolina in Jasper County outside of Ridgeland in unincorporated Gillisonville.\nGeneral information.\nSituated on a historic 18th-century estate, and surrounded by over 2,000 acres of lakes and longleaf pine forests in South Carolina's Lowcountry, architect Tom Fazio designed the championship course to fit in with its natural surroundings.\nCongaree was named \"Golf Digest\" best new private course for 2018, as well as being named the best golf course built during the decade of 2010–19. The club was ranked 39th in \"Golf Digest\"'s America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses 2021–2022.\nWith the 2021 RBC Canadian Open's cancellation due to logistical challenges related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Congaree was selected to host that week's PGA Tour event. It was called the Palmetto Championship at Congaree and took place from June 10–13, 2021. The winner was Garrick Higgo and it marked his first career PGA Tour win.\nIt was announced on June 29, 2022, that the PGA TOUR’s CJ Cup will be hosted at Congaree the week of October 17-23, 2022, after the event was contested in Las Vegas at Shadow Creek Golf Course and The Summit Club the previous two years. The name of the tournament has been changed to THE CJ CUP in South Carolina.\nIn the fall of 2023 Congaree was selected to host the 2025 Arnold Palmer Cup. The tournament is scheduled to be played at the course June 5-7 of that year. The Ryder Cup-style amateur event features the top men’s and women’s collegiate golfers, matching a U.S. team against a team of international players (12 men &amp; 12 women per team).\nHistory.\nPrior to the development of Congaree into a golf course, it had long been an estate known by other names. Its earliest known date of existence is 1770, when John Hobard received a grant for 100 acres for services rendered to King George III. From 1811 to 1828 it went through three different owners with Richard James Davant purchasing the estate from his father in law and changing the name to Davant Plantation. The original Greek Revival home was burned by order of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in 1865 along with much of the rest of Gillisonville, SC. Only two auxiliary buildings survived. Davant dismantled a much simpler, circa 1820 house that was located on a nearby plantation, which he also owned, and transferred it piece-by-piece to the site of his former home.\nFrom 1938 to 1991 the property was transferred three more times, ultimately to Mr. and Mrs. B. H. Rutledge Moore. The Moores resided on the plantation year-round and operated it as a quail hunting preserve.\nIn 1995, the historic house was the primary filming location for the movie Something to Talk About starring Julia Roberts.\nIn 2014, a North Carolina developer under the name Davant Farming and Timber Company bought the property. The development became Congaree. From 2015 to 2017, the historic house was renovated and other facilities were added to fit in with the style of the existing buildings. This included a lodge, several cottages and a 12-bedroom inn.\nIn September 2019, Congaree made an unsuccessful pitch at hosting the 2025 Presidents Cup.\nFoundation.\nThe founders of Congaree - Dan Friedkin and the late Bob McNair - set out to create a new philanthropic model that unites ambassador-members with a shared purpose to positively impact the lives of young people, locally and around the globe, by providing educational and vocational opportunities through the game of golf. It currently supports programs with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Sergeant Jasper Golf Club in Ridgeland, SC, youth golf instruction at Ridgeland-Hardeeville High School, and the Lowcountry Food Bank.\nThe signature philanthropic program of the Congaree Foundation is the Congaree Global Golf Initiative, a college preparatory program for underserved high school students who aspire to play college golf. Each summer, participants come to Congaree for a week and receive golf instruction from teaching experts and work with academic and college counselors to help them overcome the barriers to playing college athletics."

It was the sixth time that Laval had hosted the tournament and the first time since hosting back-to-back tournaments in 2002 and 2003.\nThe top-seeded UBC Thunderbirds won their fourth consecutive national championship following their sweep of the host Laval Rouge et Or. With the victory, the Thunderbirds set a CIS record with the eighth championship win in program history, which broke a three-way tie with the Winnipeg Wesmen and Alberta Pandas who had won seven each."

Wright qualifies for Scotland through residency, having moved there in 2017.\nClub career.\nWhile attending the University of Otago, New Zealand, she played for the establishment's team from 2011 to 2013. During her time playing there, she transitioned from playing in position 12 to hooker. She then played for Otago Spirit in 2013, before moving to New Zealand's Canterbury Women in 2014.\nOn moving to the UK in 2017, Wright played for Watsonians as a Hooker / Prop since 2017. She played in the final of the 2018 Sarah Beaney Cup against Hillhead Jordan, which Wright's team lost, although Wright scored one of seven tries for her side during the match. In 2019, the Ladies XV won the Sarah Beaney Cup for the first time in the victory over Hillhead Jordanhill, with a final score of 21-17 and Wright was awarded player of the match in the final.\nWright signed for Sale Sharks Women in late 2021, making her debut against Loughborough Lightning.\nInternational career.\nWright was selected for the first time for Scotland Women in January 2020 to play against Spain; a match which the team won 36–12. During the match, she came off the bench to score 7 tries. She earned further caps in the disrupted 2020 Women's Six Nations Championship in matches against Ireland and England under the coaching of Philip Doyle.\nShe says of her appointment to the Scottish team, \"\"If you had asked me three or four years ago would I have seen myself in the position I am in now as an international player I’d probably have said ‘no’, but it has been an opportunity that I have been very lucky to have and I have to keep putting in the hard work.”\"\nIn the 2021 Women's Six Nations Championship, Wright was given a three-match ban after being handed a red card for a high tackle on English player Vickii Cornborough shortly after coming on in the team's opening match against England, which was lost 52–10. The ban was later halved at a disciplinary hearing but she missed the games against Italy and Wales as a result.\nPersonal life.\nWright first started playing rugby at the age of four in Reefton, New Zealand, playing for her local club there until the age of 14. Her first coach was her father. She continued to play when she moved to Canada at 16.\nWright moved to Scotland in January 2017 and spent a few months in Dumfries before moving to Edinburgh, where she began playing rugby to meet people.\nShe is also a qualified physiotherapist. During the COVID-19 epidemic she was deployed to helping rehabilitate patients in the NHS who were recovering from the disease."

In the 1966–67 season, the competition was replaced by the Turkish Basketball Super League (BSL).\nThe Basketball Super League (; BSL), also known as the ING Basketbol Süper Ligi for sponsorship reasons, is the top men's professional basketball division of the Turkish basketball league system.

Galatasaray and Modaspor were in the championship race until the last game and they had the same number of points. Therefore, the last game was very important for both Galatasaray and Modaspor since the champion would be determined by total point difference. In the game against Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe officials withdrew their team from the match with just 44 seconds left to the end of the match due to Fenerbahçe being behind by 13 points, with no chance of turning the game. Thus the match could not be concluded. Nevertheless, the Federation of Sports declared that such behavior of the Fenerbahçe officials would not be acceptable and there were two domestic champions, Galatasaray and Modaspor, in that year. The trophy was split into two pieces and both clubs could keep these in their museums.\nFinal ranking\n1967 Turkish Basketball Championship.\n1967 season was the last season of Turkish Basketball Championship in Turkey before Basketball Super League.

The championship was played between champion of 1966-67 Basketball Super League Altınordu and winner of 1966-67 Turkish Basketball Cup Fenerbahçe. Altınordu won the championship by winning two matches against Fenerbahçe."

The team attempted to hire George Schmael, as he would also be able to handle the lacrosse team as well, but George Orton remained in charge for the first part of the season. As the team was forming, two transfers stood out for the Quakers: Pinney, formerly of Minnesota, and Blank, from Army both showed talent in goal and gave the Quakers a bit of hope before their opening game against Yale.\nPenn won their for game of the season but, perhaps more importantly, they had defeated Yale for the first time in Program history. The team would have to wait until after Christmas to play their second game and there was hope that the team was on the ascent. Princeton dampened those hopes with a 4–0 victory. Despite playing well, the Quakers were unable to stop the Tiger's star center, Van Gerbig. To make matters worse, Penn lost their center, Wanamaker, to a deep cut on the leg that would heal, but not enough before their rematch with Yale. Even with Yale missing their own star player, the Bulldogs avenged their earlier loss with a 8–3 dissection of the Quakers.\nWanamaker remained sidelined in the team's next game but the match with Columbia saw Penn overcome an early deficit and match the Lions goal-for-goal until they triumphed with an overtime win. After a second loss to Princeton, the team paused for a few weeks for exams. When they returned, they did so with a new head coach. Frank Winters had been the coach of the Cleveland Athletic Club for four years and but wouldn't be able to take over until after the two game on the weekend of the 10th.\nThe team headed to upstate New York for their next two games, first facing Hamilton. The team performed well but fell to the strong Continentals squad. The next day they got a chance to redeem themselves against Cornell. Even with Wanamaker back in the lineup, Penn ended Orton's tenure as coach on a low note. Despite the slide, the arrival of Winters for the next game against Lafayette reignited the embers of hope and the team responded with a rousing triumph. Wanamaker scored five times in their 7–1 win and team got ready for a quick turnaround.\nUnfortunately, all of the team's remaining games were eventually cancelled. Two games in early March had been previous postponed due to scheduling conflicts and the game on the 25th against Army was called off at the last minute. After the season, Frank Winters decided that travelling from Cleveland to Philadelphia was an untenable proposition and would not return as head coach. He was behind the bench for just a single game in the end.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

A major change was made in the discipline this season due to the recent dominance of slalom specialists in the combined over speed racers (downhill/Super G). As was previously the case, the first run continued to be the speed discipline (with Super-G having the preference over downhill). The second run (the slalom) then started in reverse order of finish in the speed run, which allowed the slalom specialists (who tended to be significantly slower in the speed run) to tackle fresh snow as the first down the hill in the slalom run, while the speed specialists had to face the more challenging rutted snow at the end of the day, as the last skiers of the 30 who qualified for the second run. Instead, the second run was changed to start in the same order as the finish of the speed run, so that the leader after the speed run became the first to race on the fresh slalom course.\nIn the 2020 season, two of the three combined races were run as a Super-G followed by a slalom (traditionally called an Alpine combined); only the race at Wengen featured a downhill followed by a slalom (traditionally known as a super-combined). Two of the three events (both of the Alpine combineds) were won by Alexis Pinturault of France, the only skier this season who ranked in the top ten in both Super-G and slalom, who thus won the season championship. At this time, combined races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2020 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (but were not held due to the pandemic)."

        "text": "The men's parallel competition in the 2020 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup was contested as a World Cup discipline separate from slalom for the first time in 2020. Prior to the season, FIS decided to combine parallel skiing events (including all of parallel giant slalom, parallel slalom, and city events (parallel slaloms held on courses built within cities)) into a new discipline, joining the existing disciplines of downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and combined. The discipline winner would receive a small crystal globe, similar to the other disciplines. However, at the same time, FIS decided to drop the city events to reduce the amount of travel required during the World Cup season, planning to replace them with more parallel events at regular venues.\nThe parallel format was also changed to make the race more TV-friendly. Parallel races now began with one classic qualification run to determine the top 32, who advanced to the elimination phase of the main competition. The round of 32 used the existing run and re-run format, so that each competitor got to start from each side, but from the round of 16 forward, there was only one run per race and a direct knockout system—the loser of each race was gone. However, the new format immediately became controversial, as making two giant slalom courses equal in a single-run format proved close to impossible, and the first men's parallel giant slalom races suffered from \"the luck of the draw\" becoming determinative: all eight round-of-16 matches were won by the racer on the same randomly-selected course.\nUltimately, only two parallel events, both parallel giant slaloms, were scheduled and held in the 2019–20 season. Swiss skier Loïc Meillard won the second event and also won the first-ever discipline championship for men in parallel. At this time, individual parallel races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2020 for Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy but were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

And the battle eventually turned into a three-man battle between two Norwegians -- Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, a speed specialist, and Henrik Kristoffersen, a technical specialist -- and a Frenchman -- Alexis Pinturault, who competes in all disciplines.\nAfter only canceling one race all season (in Japan) thanks to aggressive rescheduling, the season was terminated with the final seven events all being canceled. The first was cancelled due to wind and fog; the following six were all canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The last event completed prior to the premature shutdown was a downhill at Kvitfjell, and in that race, Kilde (who finished second, worth 80 points) grabbed the overall lead by 54 points from Pinturault (who failed to finish in the top 30 and thus did not score).

        "text": "The basketball tournaments of National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) 77th season hosted by the Philippine Christian University began on July 7, 2001, at the Araneta Coliseum with Manila mayor Lito Atienza as the special guest and speaker, followed by the opening ceremonies and a quadruple-header. Games then are subsequently held at Rizal Memorial Coliseum. The opening rites and the games were aired live by the Media Conglomerates Inc. over PTV/NBN through the facilities of Silverstar Communications, Inc.\nMen's tournament.\nElimination round.\nScores.\nResults on top and to the right of the dashes are for first-round games; those to the bottom and to the left of it are second-round games.\nSemifinals.\nSan Sebastian and JRU have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\n(1) JRU vs. (4) Benilde.\nIn Game 1, the defending champions Blazers relied on its star, Sunday Salvacion, who capped 39 points in the game including six treys. The game was a nip-and-tuck affair until midway in the first half, when Salvacion broke a 14-all deadlock. The Bombers never recovered and faced a 15-point deficit entering the final two minutes.\nThe Heavy Bombers relied on its veterans to mount a huge lead, 58–32 in the third quarter and never looked back. Defending champion Blazers, however, conspired a comeback by making ten triples, but it wasn't enough to push themselves on the way to Finals. Graduating players Ernani Epondulan finished with 35 points and Ariel Capus made 17 of his own.\n(2) San Sebastian vs. (3) Mapúa.\nThe Cardinals, led by rookie point guard Jeffrey Martin, Steve Marucot, and Roberto Lagar found their rhythm in the final period of Game 1 to force the Stags to a rubber match. Lagar hit back-to-back treys midway in the final period to give his team the lead, 57–49. However, the Stags recovered and reduced the deficit, 59–58, thanks to Michael Gonzales' pair of charities in the last 21 seconds. The Stags went to fouls to stop the clock when Lagar missed his last free throw but Marucot's putback sealed the victory for the Cardinals.\nThe Stags, who are enjoying a twice-to-beat advantage, relied on endgame breaks in Game 2 to eliminate Mapúa and advance to the Finals.\nFinals.\nThe San Sebastian Stags are back again in the Finals after their disappointing defeat from CSB Blazers last season. They last held their five-straight championships from 1993 to 1997 and then the streak ended in 1998 at the hands of Letran Knights.\nMeanwhile, the JRU Heavy Bombers has not seen a title since 1972. They came close to winning the title in 1999, only to falter to the Letran Knights. The disappointment continued last year when they were beaten twice by the San Sebastian Stags in the semifinals.\nThe two teams clashed neck-to-neck all throughout Game 1 but the Stags are the better team in crunch time. The Heavy Bombers entered the final quarter with the lead when the Stags applied its pressure defense. Stags' Roy Falcasantos converted a layup in the last 48 seconds of the game to break a 74-all tieup then later converted a charity to give his team the win.\nJRU relied on the offense of season MVP Nani Epondulan, Joel Finuliar, Rendel Dela Rea, and Ariel Capus to register a 68–54 lead in the final quarter of Game 2 to keep the Stags at bay and then finally made a comeback to the series.\nShowing experience, the Stags never faltered from the start of Game 3, as they outclassed the Heavy Bombers by 33 points en route to their 10th NCAA championship. Nani Epondulan, the season MVP, tallied 13 points in the first half, but was made scoreless in the second half."

        "title": "2020–21 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2020–21 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 100th season of play for the program. They represented the University of Minnesota in the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. This season marked the 31st season in the Big Ten Conference. They were coached by Bob Motzko, in his third season, and played their home games at 3M Arena at Mariucci.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Minnesota's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDespite all of the uncertainty about the season, Minnesota began with a tremendous start. The team won its first 10 games, rocketing up the rankings and claiming the top spot for 5 consecutive weeks. After losing their first game of the season to Wisconsin, the Gophers were stunned by Notre Dame and were swept on home ice. After falling to #4, the team took its frustrations out on Arizona State, scoring 10 goals in back-to-back games. The astounding weekend provided the first double-digit-goal game for the program in 17 years and the first time they had done so in consecutive games since 1983. The Gophers hung near the top of the ranking for the remainder of the season, but a second home sweep, this time by Wisconsin, prevented Minnesota from not only receiving the top spot but also caused the Gophers to finish second in the Big Ten standings. By losing 3 out of 4 against the Badgers, Minnesota finished .002 behind Wisconsin due to the team cancelling a weekend series against Penn State.\nWhile the team missed out on a regular season title, the bigger hit came by missing out on the bye for the conference tournament. Minnesota faced Michigan State in the quarterfinals and, despite outshooting the Spartans, found themselves trailing late in the third period. Minnesota wasn't able to score a single goal on MSU until less than 5 minutes remained but they were saved by the second worst offense in the nation and ended regulation with a 1–1 tie. Minnesota completely dominated the extra session, shooting 13 shots on goal in just over 10 minutes, and won the game on a goal from the team's scoring leader, Sampo Ranta. After the narrow escape, the Golden Gophers found themselves in another nail-biter, having to get past Michigan in the semifinals. The Wolverines held Minnesota at bay and built a 2-goal lead after 40 minutes. The Gophers were matched shot-for-shot by Michigan in the third but the Maroon and Gold found the net twice and tied the score. This time it only took 6 extra minutes before team captain Sammy Walker netted the game-winner, sending Minnesota to the title game. Still smarting over losing out on the regular season title, Minnesota got out to a lead in the first and then used a huge second period to build a 4-goal lead. The Gophers needed every goal because Wisconsin came roaring back in the third, firing 21 shots in the final frame alone and scoring three times to cut the lead to 1. With time winding down and the Gophers clinging to their lead, Wisconsin was forced to pull their goaltender. Minnesota scored an empty-net goal to seal the game and win the team's first Big Ten Championship in six years.\nMinnesota received the 3rd overall seed and was given the top spot in the West Regional bracket. The team lived up to their billing in the opening game by overwhelming Omaha 7–2. In their second game, the Gophers faced #5 Minnesota State after the mavericks had won the program's first tournament game at the Division I level. MSU was riding high and played a nearly perfect game, holding the Gophers to just 9 shots on goal through the first two periods. Minnesota woke up in the third and started shooting the puck but the team couldn't get anything by Dryden McKay and the Golden Gophers ended their season with a 0–4 loss.\nColin Schmidt and Noah Weber sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | "

Eventually, Swiss skier Corinne Suter, who held a slim 19-point lead over Federica Brignone of Italy with just the finals remaining, won the discipline title for 2020 when the finals, scheduled for Thursday, 19 March in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy."

They were also joined on the ice by two other California programs (California and Loyola) for their first official seasons. UCLA, however did have to content with several problems throughout the season. The first issue was a lack of a head coach for the team. Former team captain Harvey Tafe was brought in to keep the team afloat. The Bruins also had to scramble to find a place to practice and were only able to schedule three games on the year. The team didn't even meet until February 25 but, by the time they did, the program had been rescued from the abyss. The reason the team was so late in starting was that the school's administration had decided to discontinue the program after the second season but a later meeting approved its renewal for the spring semester.\nAfter some wrangling, the team scheduled three games against USC with the first coming on March 12. Unsurprisingly, with the Trojans having been together for far longer than the Bruins, UCLA lost a lopsided affair to begin their season. Afterwards, UCLA played far better against Southern California. The return of Chester Englund between the pipes helped keep their final two games within one goal, though they lost both.\nJacobs served as team manager.\nNote: UCLA used the same colors as UC-Berkley until 1949.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He also became the fifth man in the Open Era to win the Channel Slam (French Open—Wimbledon double).\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev were in contention for the world No. 1 singles ranking; Djokovic retained the top ranking when Medvedev lost in the fourth round.\nThis event marked the final professional singles appearance of 20-time major champion and former world No. 1 Roger Federer; he lost in the quarterfinals to Hubert Hurkacz. Federer became the oldest man to reach the Wimbledon quarterfinals in the Open Era, and the oldest man to reach a major quarterfinal since Ken Rosewall in January 1977.

This marked only the second time that she lost in the first round of a major, and the first time since 2014 that the Wimbledon final did not feature one of the Williams sisters (as Venus Williams lost to Ons Jabeur in the second round), as well as the first time since 1997 that neither sister progressed beyond the second round.\nThis was the first edition of Wimbledon since 2009 that saw the top two seeds progress to the semifinals. Additionally, this was the first major in the Open Era where two wildcards, Liudmila Samsonova and Emma Raducanu (who made her first major appearance overall), reached the fourth round. Raducanu became the youngest British woman to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon in the Open Era. Jabeur became the first Tunisian player and the first Arabian woman in history to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on WTA rankings as of 21 June 2021. Rankings and points are as of 28 June 2021.\n†The player did not qualify for the tournament in 2019. Accordingly, points for her 16th best result are deducted instead.\nWithdrawn players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but withdrew before the tournament began.\nOther entry information.\nWild card entries.\nThe following players were awarded wild cards into the main draw."

        "text": "The 2022 Australian was a Grand Slam tennis tournament that took place at Melbourne Park, Australia from 17 to 30 January 2022. It was the 110th edition of the Australian Open, the 54th in the Open Era, and the first Grand Slam of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's main sponsor was Kia.\nThe men's singles title was won by Rafael Nadal, and was Nadal's 21st major title, and his second Australian Open. He defeated second seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, winning in five sets after being two sets down. In winning the title, Nadal broke the record for all-time men's major singles title - it was previously tied at 20 between himself, Novak Djokovic, and Roger Federer. The women's singles title was won by Ashleigh Barty, who won her first Australian Open title and third major title. She defeated 27th seed Danielle Collins in straight sets. Barty was the first Australian to win the title since Chris O'Neil won the title in 1978. The final would also prove to be Barty's last professional match, with Barty announcing her retirement in March 2022.\nThe event was overshadowed by Djokovic's battle with Australian immigration after disclosing he was not vaccinated against COVID-19. In the end, he was unable to participate after his visa was cancelled twice by Australian Immigration Minister Alex Hawke.\nTournament.\nThe 2022 Australian Open was the 110th edition of the tournament, held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The tournament returned to its traditional January slot after the 2021 tournament was held in February after a precaution over concerns with the strict COVID-19 protocols.\nThe tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2022 ATP Tour and the 2022 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as the mixed doubles events. There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments. The junior competitions returned after a year of absence. There are also singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place across a series of 25 courts, including the four main show courts of Rod Laver Arena, John Cain Arena, Margaret Court Arena and 1573 Arena. It was also the debut of Kia Arena, which made for five main tennis arenas.\nPoint distribution and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points offered for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Australian Open total prize money for 2022 increased by 3.5% to a tournament record A$74,000,000.\nDjokovic's vaccination and visa controversy.\nOn 4 January 2022, defending champion Novak Djokovic announced that he could compete in the Australian Open after he had been granted medical exemption from mandatory COVID-19 vaccination by Tennis Australia and the health department of the state of Victoria, after a blind review of his application. However, the Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Karen Andrews, stated that regardless of Tennis Australia and Victoria's decision, Australia's border requirements would be still enforced by the federal government, namely that unvaccinated individuals entering Australia \"must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons\".\nOn 5 January, Djokovic was detained by the Australian Border Force upon arriving in Australia and being determined to not meet the entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers. His lawyers requested an injunction against deportation in order to appeal the visa refusal; this allowed Djokovic to remain confined in a detention hotel pending the outcome of the appeal. On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court ruled against the government on procedural grounds, ordered his release from detention and directed the federal government to pay his legal expenses. The reason for the ruling was that when Djokovic was in immigration holding before his visa was cancelled, Australian officials reneged on an agreement to give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview; this led the Australian government to concede they treated Djokovic unreasonably.\nDjokovic's travel declaration on entry to Australia erroneously stated that he had not travelled anywhere else in the previous 14 days. There was additional controversy due to his meetings with a photographer and children after he claimed to have tested positive, and discrepancies discovered in his COVID test documents, which he had hoped to use to obtain an exemption.\nTwenty-five other players and staff had applied for a medical exemption and a handful of applications had been granted. Among those, two people with the same type of visa and exemption as Djokovic had reportedly been allowed into the country. Player Renata Voráčová was one of those granted an exemption and allowed into the country. She had participated in a warm-up tournament but was subsequently detained in the same hotel as Djokovic and deported on 8 January 2022. Filip Serdarusic, a tennis coach with the same exemption, was also allowed entry but left the country voluntarily.\nPublic opinion in Australia of an unvaccinated athlete being permitted to participate in an event that spectators could not attend unless fully vaccinated was overwhelmingly negative. Another concern was that Djokovic should not be given entry while many Australians remained stranded overseas due to the pandemic. A poll jointly published by newspapers \"The Herald Sun\" and \"The Age\" showed that 71% of respondents did not want Djokovic to be allowed to stay. The furore that unfolded in the media over the issue achieved worldwide attention.\nOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, the Australian Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the \"Migration Act 1958\" to cancel Djokovic's visa, citing \"health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so\". An application for review of the decision was made in the Federal Court, but was dismissed on 16 January, ruling out Djokovic's participation. Djokovic said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision but accepted the ruling, and flew out of Australia that night. Salvatore Caruso, ranked 150 in the world, took his place in the draw as the \"lucky loser\".\nExternal links.\n "

While the coach and captain returned, most of the team was different than the previous season and that did not help the Bruins against their two opponents. They faced California and USC in two series during the year and, unfortunately, didn't win a single game. In most games the team's defense was good enough to keep the score close but, as it had been last year, the offense was lacking. Only towards the end of the year did UCLA look like a unified squad. While it was too late to salvage the 1930 season, since most of the players were to return for the following year there was some hope of improvement from the Bruins.\nOn a positive note, the ice hockey team was the only minor sport at UCLA that was able to not only pay for itself, but turn a profit for the year.\nJacobs served as team manager.\nNote: UCLA used the same colors as UC-Berkley until 1949.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The Test series formed part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship, and the ODI series formed part of the inaugural 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. On 9 February 2022, Cricket South Africa confirmed the schedule and venues for the series.\nBangladesh won the first ODI by 38 runs, recording their first win against the hosts in an international cricket match in South Africa. South Africa won the second ODI by seven wickets, with Kagiso Rabada taking his second five-wicket haul in an ODI match. Bangladesh won the third ODI by nine wickets, with Taskin Ahmed also taking a five-wicket haul. As a result, Bangladesh won the series 2–1, giving them their first ODI series win in South Africa.\nSouth Africa won the first Test match by 220 runs. In the second innings Keshav Maharaj took seven wickets for 32 runs, with Bangladesh being bowled out for 53 runs, their second-lowest total in Test cricket. All of Bangladesh's wickets were taken by spin bowling, from Maharaj and Simon Harmer. It was the first time that just two bowlers had taken all ten wickets in an innings for South Africa in a Test match. It was also the first time in more than 100 years that zero deliveries were bowled by seam bowlers in a completed innings for South Africa.\nOn the morning of the fourth day of the second Test match, Sarel Erwee and Wiaan Mulder were replaced by Glenton Stuurman and Khaya Zondo as COVID-19 substitutes. It was the first time that COVID-19 substitutes had been used in Test cricket, with Khaya Zondo making his Test debut in the process. South Africa won the match by 332 runs, winning the series 2–0.\nSquads.\nPrior to the tour, Shakib Al Hasan had requested a break from international cricket, with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) initially agreeing to his request. However, after a meeting with the BCB's President, Nazmul Hassan, Shakib agreed to travel to South Africa. Shakib eventually missed the Test series, after several family members were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. During the first Test, the BCB confirmed that both Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam would return home to Bangladesh following the conclusion of the match due to injuries.\nIn March 2022, Cricket South Africa (CSA) agreed to allow their Test-playing cricketers to choose between the matches against Bangladesh or playing in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL), with a unanimous vote for them to play in the IPL. As a result, South Africa named a weakened squad for the Test matches, with Marco Jansen, Aiden Markram, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Kagiso Rabada and Rassie van der Dussen all playing in the IPL."

The Nittany Lions represented Pennsylvania State University and were coached by Guy Gadowsky, in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nFresh off of their first tournament appearance, Penn State entered the season looking to improve on their newfound success. Unfortunately, the team had some difficulty finding traction early in the season. The Nittany Lions split each of their first five weekends of the season, progressively declining in the rankings, until they were knocked out altogether by Notre Dame. Peyton Jones, who had played spectacularly as a freshman, was struggling early in his sophomore season and began losing his first grip on the starting role.\nIn mid-November Penn State began to find their form and began a nearly 2-month unbeaten streak. They jumped back into the top-20 after a 4–0 shoutout against Ohio State that saw Jones seize his primary job in the crease and by mid-January the team had nearly returned to their preseason ranking. Immediately following their run, however, the offense flagged and the team went 8 games without a win. Because that stretch was played almost entirely against ranked teams, PSU wasn't punished too harshly in the standings (ending up at 16), but their hopes at returning to the tournament were balanced on a razor's edge. The team was tied for 5th in the conference entering the final weekend and they were facing a top-10 team in Minnesota. Surprisingly, the Nittany Lions easily handled the Gophers and leapt ahead of Minnesota in the standings, ending up as the 4th seed by just 1 point.\nWhen the conference tournament began, PSU was again facing Minnesota. The team took advantage of their home games and swept the Golden Gophers with a nail-biter in the second match. The four consecutive wins essentially flipped Minnesota and Penn State in the rankings. When the team headed to South Bend the following week they were ranked 12th in the country and all but guaranteed a spot in the tournament regardless of the result. The team performed well against the Fighting Irish but fell 2–3.\nPenn State was ranked 12th by the NCAA selection committee and given a #3 seed in the tournament. They opened against Denver as the de facto home team since they were the host for the Midwest Regional. Unfortunately, the team was overwhelmed by the Pioneers; Denver scored the first four goals and outshout the Nittany Lions 42–27 en route to a 5–1 win.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nPlayers drafted into the NHL.\n2018 NHL Entry Draft.\n\"No Penn State players were selected in 2018.\""

        "text": "A three-point field goal (also known as a \"three-pointer\" or \"3-pointer\") is a field goal in a basketball game, made from beyond the three-point line, a designated arc radiating from the basket. A successful attempt is worth three points, in contrast to the two points awarded for shots made inside the three-point line. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) keeps records of the Division I 3-point field goal makes per game (3PG) average annual leaders. The statistic was first recognized in Division I women's basketball in the 1987–88 season, when the NCAA made the three-pointer a mandatory feature throughout women's basketball. From the 1987–88 season through the 2007–08 men's season, the three-point perimeter was marked at for both men's and women's college basketball. After the 2007–08 season, the NCAA moved the men's three-point line back to , while the women's line remained the same. The women's line would be moved back to match the men's line effective with the 2011–12 season. On June 5, 2019, the NCAA men's rules committee voted to extend the men's three-point line to the FIBA distance of , effective in 2019–20 in Division I and 2020–21 in lower NCAA divisions. The women's line remained at 20 ft 9 in until being moved to the FIBA arc in 2021–22.\nNCAA record books list single-season three-point record holders both on overall and per-game bases, but the official season leaders are based solely on per-game average. Caitlin Clark holds both records for single-season three-point scoring, making 201 threes and averaging 5.15 per game during her final season at Iowa in 2023–24. Both records had previously been held by Taylor Pierce of Idaho, with 154 threes and an average of 4.53 per game in 2018–19. Clark, who also led Division I in threes per game in 2022–23, is also the all-time leader in career threes, with 548 from 2020–21 to 2023–24. The player with the highest 3PG average over the span of her entire career (with a minimum of 150 made threes) is Alabama State's Lisa McMullen, who made 4.00 per game over two years."

        "text": "Ilkeston Rutland Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club based in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, England. The club has a history dating back to 1824.\nGround.\nIlkeston Rutland's main ground is the Rutland Sports Park, on Oakwell Drive in Ilkeston which includes a two lane, all-weather net facility. Their second ground is at The Stute on Hallam Field Road. The 1st and 2nd XI teams use the Rutland Sports Park pitch, rated by the DCCL as a Grade A+ ground, and the 3rd and 4th XI use the pitch on The Stute, rated as a Grade B ground. Their main ground (Rutland Sports Park) has a proud history of annually hosting 1st Class recreation matches between 1925 – 1994. In 1977, the ground hosted Derbyshire's Gillette Cup quarter-final tie against a Somerset side which included Ian Botham, Viv Richards and Joel Garner, when on an extremely hot day, 11,000 spectators packed into the ground.\nHistory.\nIlkeston Rutland Cricket Club was formed in 1829, and led a peripatetic existence for its first 100 years. The earliest known record of a cricket ground for Ilkeston was a field near to Lawn Cottage, Pimlico, donated by the Duke of Rutland. A few years later a ground to the south of St. Mary's churchyard was made available, known as the Old Cricket Ground. By 1876, the club relocated to a new ground on land also loaned by the Duke of Rutland on the understanding that the local authority would develop it into a recreation ground. However, the ground quality at this stage was so poor that turf had to be lifted and transported from the Old Cricket Ground. Ilkeston Rutland Cricket Club was one of the founder members of the Derbyshire League in 1890. The club then joined the Ilkeston &amp; District League, and won in 1909. In 1914 George V visited Ilkeston and the land was finally passed to the authority and the ground extended. The cricket ground was prepared to county match standards and officially opened as the Rutland Recreation Ground on Wednesday 6 May 1925.&lt;ref name=\"Ilkeston - Rutland Sports Park w/e 12 March 2006\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ilkeston Rutland Cricket Club tendered to use the ground and started to use it the following year. Derbyshire played the first match there later that summer, and continued to do so until 1994. After a break during the Second World War, the club was revived in 1947. By 1978 the club started off the club's junior section. In 1982, the club amalgamated with the Ilkeston Casuals, winning the O J Jackson Cup the same year, and in 2017, the club amalgamated with the Stanton Elks, originally called the Stanton &amp; Awsworth Elks Cricket Club.\nThe Club currently has 4 senior teams competing in the Derbyshire County Cricket League, a women's softball team in the East Midlands Women's Cricket League\n and a long established and very successful junior training section that play competitive cricket in the Erewash Young Cricketers League.\nClub performance.\nThe Derbyshire County Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2002."

        "text": "The Blue Rapids baseball team was a minor league baseball team based in Blue Rapids, Kansas. In 1910, the Blue Rapids team played briefly as members of the Class D level Eastern Kansas League with no team moniker, common in the era. The 1910 season was the only season of play for the league and the Blue Rapids-based team. Blue Rapids hosted minor league home games at Riverside Park.\nHistory.\nThe 1910 Blue Rapids team first brought minor league baseball to Blue Rapids, Kansas during the season. Blue Rapids played as charter members of the 1910 Class D level, six–team Eastern Kansas League. League members beginning the season were the Hiawatha Athletics, Holton, Horton, Marysville, Sabetha and Seneca. After the season began on June 8, 1910, Holton, with a 15–31 record, moved to Blue Rapids on August 25, 1910.\nAfter joining 1910 league play, the Holton/Blue Rapids team finished their 1910 season in last place. With an overall record of 26–54 and 11–23 while based in Blue Rapids, the team ended the season in sixth place in the Eastern Kansas League standings, playing the season under manager Ted McGrew in both locations. Blue Rapids finished 26.5 games behind first place Sabetha in the six–team league.\nThe final 1910 Eastern Kansas League standings were led by Sabetha, who ended the season with a 53–28 record, followed by Seneca (46–39), Hiawatha Indians (44–44), Marysville (38–39), Horton (35–38) and Holton / Blue Rapids (26–54). The Eastern Kansas League permanently folded after their only season of 1910.\nBlue Rapids, Kansas has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Blue Rapids team played 1910 minor league home games at Riverside Park. Riverside Park later hosted an exhibition game between the Chicago White Sox and New York Giants on October 24, 1913. The event occurred after $1,000 was raised to host the game, which occurred on a barnstorming tour by the two teams. Jim Thorpe, John McGraw Sam Crawford and Christy Mathewson were in uniform for the game, which drew 2,500 fans. Still in use today as a public park, Riverside Park is located at 305 West 5th Street in Blue Rapids, Kansas. There are historical markers at the park."

        "title": "2021 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 2021 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 2021 Kentucky Derby presented by Woodford Reserve) was the 147th running of the Kentucky Derby. It took place on May 1, 2021, in Louisville, Kentucky. The field was open to 20 horses, who qualified for the race by earning points on the 2021 Road to the Kentucky Derby. The Kentucky Derby is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of and has been run at Churchill Downs racetrack since its inception in 1875. The purse for 2021 was million.\nAfter the 2020 Derby had been postponed to September because of the COVID-19 pandemic and held behind closed doors, the 2021 edition returned to its traditional May schedule and allowed spectators, although in reduced numbers and with social distancing measures in place.\nMedina Spirit crossed the finish line first, which appeared to have given his trainer Bob Baffert a record seventh win in the race and jockey John Velazquez his fourth Derby win. However, the horse tested positive for betamethasone after the race. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission made the final decision to disqualify the horse on February 21, 2022. Because Medina Spirit was disqualified, Mandaloun was named the winner.\nThe race was broadcast by NBC, with coverage by NBCSN of undercard races beginning at 12:30 pm EDT and main network coverage of pre-race activities starting at 2:30 pm EDT. It was also livestreamed on NBCSports.com. The post time was 7:01 pm.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is only open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds, thus entrants in the 2021 race were foaled in 2018, as part of the North American foal crop of 21,181. The field is limited to twenty horses who qualify based on points earned in the 2021 Road to the Kentucky Derby, a series of designated races that was first introduced in 2013. This point system replaced the previous graded stakes race earnings system.\nMost positions in the Derby starting gate are earned on the main Road, consisting of 35 races in North America plus one in Dubai. The major preps for the Kentucky Derby are the Louisiana Derby, Jeff Ruby Steaks, UAE Derby, Florida Derby, Wood Memorial, Blue Grass Stakes, Santa Anita Derby, and Arkansas Derby. Each of these races provided the winner with 100 qualifying points, essentially guaranteeing that horse a berth in the Derby provided the owner paid the required nomination and entry fees. The first four of these major preps were run in late March 2021 and were won by Hot Rod Charlie, Like The King, Rebel's Romance, and Known Agenda respectively. The next three major preps were run on April 3, 2021, and were won by Bourbonic, Essential Quality, and Rock Your World. The last major prep was run on April 10 and was won by Super Stock.\nOne qualification position was also available via the European Road to the Kentucky Derby, and another via the Japan Road. Due in part to ongoing restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, none of these offers were accepted in 2021. These two positions reverted to qualifiers on the main Road.\nField.\nThe favorite for the 2021 Kentucky Derby was Essential Quality, who was undefeated in all five of his previous starts including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Blue Grass Stakes. Essential Quality trained at Churchill Downs and had previously won at the track, giving him a home field advantage. His main rivals were the Santa Anita Derby winner Rock Your World, Florida Derby winner Known Agenda, and Louisiana Derby winner Hot Rod Charlie. There were also several highly regarded horses who were runners-up in these events, including Highly Motivated who was second in the Blue Grass, Midnight Bourbon who was second in the Louisiana Derby, and Medina Spirit (the eventual winner), who was second in the Santa Anita Derby. The other major preps were less impressive to handicappers, and the winners of those were relative longshots in the Derby. For example, the 72–1 Wood Memorial winner Bourbonic went off at odds of 28–1.\nThe post position draw was held at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 27.\nRace description.\nAttendance and broadcasting.\nThe 2021 edition of the race returned to the Derby's traditional date on the first Saturday in May, when it had been held for 89 of the last 90 years. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 race was delayed to September and had no paid attendance. The Derby typically has one of the highest audiences of all North American sporting events, in the range of 150,000 in recent years, which includes a large infield crowd. The 2021 had a reduced attendance, with reserved seating limited to about 60% of capacity. About 15,000 general admission tickets to the infield were also sold – roughly 25% to 30% of capacity.\nRunning of the derby.\nIn his previous race at Santa Anita, Medina Spirit had rated behind the pace set by Rock Your World and had finished second. For the Derby, jockey John Velazquez decided to change tactics and instead sent Medina Spirit to the early lead with Soup and Sandwich in second. Several horses, including Essential Quality and Rock Your World, bumped at the start and lost position – Rock Your World never recovered while Essential Quality was carried wide around the first turn. Medina Spirit set solid fractions of :46.70 for the half-mile and 1:11.21, after which Soup and Sandwich fell back, eventually finishing last. Mandaloun and Hot Rod Charlie moved into contention as the field completed the mile in 1:35.98, with Mandaloun closing to within a head of Medina Spirit. Essential Quality looked threatening while making a wide move but lost momentum as they turned into the stretch. In a close finish, Medina Spirit held off his rivals to win by half a length over Mandaloun with Hot Rod Charlie just edging Essential Quality for third.\nIt was a record-breaking seventh Derby win for trainer Bob Baffert, who had earned his first such win in 1997 with Silver Charm. It was the fourth win for jockey Velazquez and the first for Zedan Racing Stables.\nMedina Spirit's share of the purse was $1,860,000.\nAftermath.\nOne week after the Kentucky Derby was run, Bob Baffert's assistant, Jimmy Barnes, was informed by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission (KHRC) that post-race testing on Medina Spirit showed 21 pg/mL of betamethasone. In Kentucky, betamethasone is classified as a Class C drug that is permitted for therapeutic use in horses, but requires a 14-day withdrawal time. Any amount of the drug detected in post-race testing is a violation and could result in a disqualification.\nIn a news conference on May 9, Baffert said that Medina Spirit was never administered betamethasone. In addition to a request for a split drug sample, Baffert requested an independent DNA and follicle test. He told reporters that he would fight the issue \"...tooth and nail because I owe it to the horse, I owe it to the owner, and I owe it to our industry.\" Shortly thereafter, Churchill Downs suspended Baffert from entering any horses at their racetrack pending the outcome of the commission's investigation.\nOn May 11, Baffert released a statement through his attorney saying that veterinarians treated Medina Spirit with Otomax, an antifungal ointment, from after the horse's second-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby until the day before the Kentucky Derby. Baffert claimed that Otomax was used to treat dermatitis on the horse's hind end, and that he did not realize the ointment had betamethasone until after the positive test was reported. Baffert said he never attempted to \"game the system or get an unfair advantage\", and quoted pharmacologists who told him that \"21 picograms of betamethasone would have no effect on the outcome of the race.\"\nOn June 2, Churchill Downs announced that the split sample had also tested positive. Churchill Downs announced that it had suspended Baffert for two years as a result of this and earlier positive tests at other racetracks. Bill Carstanjen stated for Churchill Downs that \"given these repeated failures over the last year, including the increasingly extraordinary explanations, we firmly believe that asserting our rights to impose these measures is our duty and responsibility.\"\nOn December 6, Medina Spirit died following a workout. At the time of his death, Medina Spirit was still an active racehorse, even recently winning the October 2021 Awesome Again Stakes and then afterwards finishing second in the November 2021 Breeder's Cup Classic. Three days before the horse's death, Baffert's attorney Craig Robinson publicly acknowledged that the kind of betamethasone which Medina Spirit was injected with was banned by Kentucky state rules, while also alleging it was used to improve his skin condition rather than enhance performance.\nThe Kentucky Horse Racing Commission made its final decision to disqualify the horse on February 21, 2022, with an official statement. Because Medina Spirit is disqualified, Mandaloun has been named the winner. Baffert had the right to appeal the ruling per the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission rules, which he did along with Amr F. Zedan, the owner of Medina Spirit. His appeal was later dismissed on April 18, 2022.\nMedina Spirit's disqualification for betamethasone is the first drug-related disqualification of a Kentucky Derby winner since Dancer's Image was disqualified for phenylbutazone, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), following the 1968 edition. It would be the second disqualification in three years (Maximum Security was disqualified in 2019 due to interference), and the third disqualification in the 147-year history of the race.\nResults.\nTrack condition: fast\nTimes: mile – 23.09; mile – 46.70; mile – 1:11.21; mile – 1:35.98; final – 2:01.02.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.09) (23.61) (24.51) (24.77) (25.04)\nSource: Equibase chart\nPayouts.\nThe table below shows the payout schedule for the 2021 Kentucky Derby.\n\"NOTE: In accordance to Ruling 22-0009 by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission on February 21, 2022 that changed the results of the Kentucky Derby, \"Pari-mutuel wagering is not affected by this ruling.\" All bets are based on the official results at the end of the race, not on post-race drug testing.\""

San Sebastian's Redentor Vicente was fouled on a drive, but split his charities to tie the game at 85-all with 22 seconds remaining in the final period. JRU's Wynsjohn Te had a chance to win the game but missed a difficult lay-up, sending the game into overtime.

        "text": "The Horton baseball team was a 1910 minor league baseball team based in Horton, Kansas. Horton played as members of the Class D level Eastern Kansas League. The 1910 season was the only season of play for both the league and the Horton, Kansas team. Local newspapers referred to the team as the \"Hammers.\"\nHistory.\nThe 1910 Horton team first brought minor league baseball to Horton, Kansas. Horton played as charter members of the 1910 Class D level, six–team Eastern Kansas League. The Hiawatha Athletics, Holton, Marysville, Seneca and Sabetha teams joined Horton as Eastern Kansas League charter members.\nHorton was referred to as the \"Hammers\" in newspaper articles. In a game on June 21, 1910, Horton had a starting lineup of Steele C, Eppling SS, Hall 1B, Page 3B, Hill CF, McFee RF, Chapple 2B, Barsley P, Buckles LF in their 2–1 loss to Holton. The newspaper added in the game article that \"if Horton people want a ball team they will have to 'come across.' League baseball is just as much a business proposition as any store industry in town.\"\nOn August 7, 1910, in the second game of a double header at Marysville, Horton pitcher Brownley threw a no-hitter against Marysville in a 2–1 Horton victory, with Masters playing catcher.\nDuring the season, the Horton and Marysville franchised both disbanded from the league on September 1, 1910.\nAfter folding during 1910 league play, Horton finished the season with an overall record of 35–38. The team ended the season in fifth place in the Eastern Kansas League standings, playing under manager Papa Church. Horton finished 14.0 games behind the first place Sabetha team in the six–team league final standings. The final 1910 Eastern Kansas League standings were led by Sabetha, who ended the season with a 53–28 record, followed by Seneca (46–39), Hiawatha Indians (44–44), Marysville (38–39), Horton (35–38) and Holton / Blue Rapids (26–54). The Eastern Kansas League permanently folded after their only season of 1910.\nHorton, Kansas has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe exact name and location of the 1910 Horton home ballpark is not directly referenced. The site of the Horton Aquatic Park was in use during the era as a public park. Today, the site is still in use and has a ballpark with multiple fields that are adjacent to the swimming pool. The location is 540 East 12th Street in Horton, Kansas."

        "title": "Tuesday Night Baseball",
        "text": "Tuesday Night Baseball is the de facto branding used for nationally televised live broadcasts of Major League Baseball (MLB) games in the United States on Tuesday evenings during the regular season.\nThrough the 2021 season, Tuesday night games aired on FS1, ESPN, and MLB Network. Beginning with the 2022 season, games air on TBS, branded as MLB on TBS Tuesday Night. Because TBS airs only one game on most Tuesday nights, MLB Network will often air a second game before or after the TBS game.\nHistory.\nESPN (1990–1993).\nOn January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (\"Sunday Night Baseball\", \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" and doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day.\nSince the end of that contract ESPN has not officially aired a full slate of Tuesday night games but has consistently aired several games per year since 1997. With Turner Sports gaining the exclusive rights to MLB games on Tuesday nights, Tuesday night ESPN games were discontinued.\nFox Sports.\nFX (1997–1998).\nIn 1997, FX obtained the partial pay-TV rights to MLB games; while most game telecasts aired on Monday nights or Saturday nights, 11 games in 1997 and 1 game in 1998 aired on Tuesdays.\nFS1 (2014–2021).\nFS1 occasionally aired baseball on Tuesday nights between 2014 and 2021 as part of their irregularly scheduled non-exclusive broadcast package. With the TBS television package having moved to Tuesday nights in 2021, FS1's schedule no longer includes Tuesday night games.\n\"MLB on TBS Tuesdays\" (2022–present).\nPrior to 2022, during the regular season, TBS broadcast a weekly game nationally on Sunday afternoons, under the title \"Sunday MLB on TBS\". These games were not exclusive to TBS and were blacked out in local markets, to protect the stations that hold the local broadcast rights to the games. In the affected areas, simulcasts of programming from sister network HLN aired in place of the games.\nOn September 24, 2020, it was announced that Turner Sports had renewed its baseball rights through 2028 (aligned with the conclusion of Fox's most recent extension). However instead of a package of Sunday afternoon games the contract includes primetime games on Tuesday nights throughout the regular season.\nThe program includes a 30-minute studio show before and after each game."

The Beavers represented Bemidji State University and were coached by Tom Serratore, in his 20th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Bemidji State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nBemidji State's start to the season was a bit rocky but the team started playing better by the beginning of January and took 3 out of four games from a highly ranked Bowling Green squad. After flirting with a ranking of their own for a few weeks, the Beavers put a string of wins together towards the end of the regular season that placed them firmly in the top-20. The team's performance against the top teams in the WCHA made it possible that BSU would make the NCAA Tournament without a conference title, but sweeping Michigan Tech in the quarterfinals all but guaranteed them a spot.\nThe Beavers were ranked 13th by the NCAA selection committee and were placed opposite Wisconsin for the first tournament game. The Beavers played well from the start, recording 16 shots and taking an early lead after the first period. After the Badgers cut their lead in half the game tightened up but BSU continued to fire the puck on goal and regained their two-goal lead late in the second. A gaffe by Wisconsin's netminder allowed Owen Sillinger to score the team's 4th goal and the Beavers added another early in the third. Wisconsin fought back to score twice in the final frame but the Beaver's lead was too great and an empty net goal with less than 2 seconds remaining sent Bemidji State to the regional final. The Beaver's performance in their second game was nightmarish for the team. BSU ended up recording just 18 shots all game and were unable to score on any of their six power play opportunities, which included a 5-minute major. To make matters worse, Massachusetts opened the scoring with a short-handed goal and never let the Beavers onto the game, winning the match 4–0.\nAustin Jouppi and Nick Leitner sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

It was the 14th season since it was renamed from the ULEB Cup to the EuroCup, and the sixth season under the title sponsorship name of 7DAYS.\nVirtus Bologna defeated Bursaspor Basketbol in the final, which was played at the Segafredo Arena in Bologna, to win their first EuroCup title. As winners, Virtus automatically qualified for the 2022–23 EuroLeague.\nThe defending champions were AS Monaco, who were unable to defend their title as they played in the 2021–22 EuroLeague.\nTeam allocation.\nA total of 20 teams from 10 leagues participated in the 2021–22 EuroCup Basketball.\nTeams.\nLeague positions after playoffs of the previous season shown in parentheses.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 9 July 2021 in Barcelona, Spain.\nThe 20 teams were drawn into two groups of 10, with the restriction that teams from the same league could not be drawn against each other, except when there were more than two teams from the same league participating in the regular season. For the draw, the teams were seeded into 10 pots, in accordance with the Club Ranking, based on their performance in European competitions during a three-year period and the lowest possible position that any club from that league can occupy in the draw is calculated by adding the results of the worst performing team from each league.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence:\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling do not use the seeding pots, e.g., Team 1 is not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same round (to avoid them playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control).\nRegular season.\nThe 20 teams were divided into two groups of 10 teams each. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format for a total of 18 games played by each team. The top eight teams from each group advanced to the playoffs, while the last two teams from each group were eliminated. The regular season started on 19 October 2021 and ended on 6 April 2022."

The fixtures of the tour were confirmed by Cricket Ireland on 22 April 2021, with all the three unofficial ODI matches being played at Oak Hill on 10, 12 and 13 May. \nThe bilateral series was originally used for both teams as the preparation for the World Cup Super League matches between the two sides which was held in June 2021.\nOn 4 May 2021, the Royal Dutch Cricket Association announced a 14-man squad for the series, with Scott Edwards as the captain. While the next day, Cricket Ireland also confirmed the squads for Ireland Wolves, with Harry Tector named as the captain.\nSeries summary.\nIreland Wolves started their home series with a 94 runs win as Shane Getkate's 74 runs off just 40 balls guided the Wolves to secure 276 runs in 50 overs. In response, Netherlands A could not sustain a partnership as they started to regularly lose wickets in the early overs, with Craig Young the best bowler by the Wolves, who bagged 2 wickets conceding 37 runs.\nWhile in the following match, Netherlands A fought back to level the series, as the low aggregate match ended with Dutch A side's victory by 5 wickets while chasing 95. Vivian Kingma's economic three wicket haul for just 5 runs and the consistent figures of other Dutch bowlers never allowed the Irish batters to settle in the innings.\nIn the final match, Ireland Wolves won by 5 wickets to claim the series 2–1. This time, Netherlands A had a disappointing first innings as Graeme McCarter claimed 6 for 32 to star in the Wolves' victory."

        "text": "A climbing gym is a gym dedicated to indoor climbing. Climbing gyms have climbing walls that can be used for leading, top roping, and bouldering. They sometimes offer training equipment to improve technique, strength, and endurance.\nContents of a climbing gym.\nDifferent kinds of climbing gyms focus on various types of climbing, and their layout and equipment vary accordingly.\nClimbing walls.\nA climbing wall is an artificial wall designed for climbing. Gyms dedicated to bouldering tend to have short routes without bolts, usually no more than 6 metres tall. Other gyms including or focused on sport climbing will include taller walls with bolts and quickdraws. Some climbing gyms may also include auto belays, which are motors designed to allow someone to climb without the assistance of a belayer. Some gyms may have a wall dedicated to speed climbing, in which case an auto belay will be used. A climbing gym will often have walls of several different styles, including slab walls, overhangs, and vertical walls. Some climbing gyms include programmable climbing walls such as a moon board which allow users to set climbs using a fixed set of holds and upload them for other users to try. When a climber selects a climb to try, the relevant holds are lit up by LEDs.\nProblems and climbs.\nMost climbs in a climbing gym (known as \"problems\" in bouldering) will have an approximate climbing grade and a way of identifying the holds to be used. In some gyms, holds are identified by coloured tape placed next to each hold, but it is becoming more common for the holds of a given climb to all be the same or similar colour for easy identification. Climbs will usually have some method of identifying the \"starting holds\" (the holds you use to start the climb) such as tags or tape next to each starting hold. Although the practice is not universal, many gyms use a circuit system wherein climbs of a similar grade in a gym will be the same colour, will be reset at the same time, and sometimes will be set in a particular style.\nTraining section.\nMany climbing gyms will contain an area dedicated to training. This can include general physical fitness equipment, such as a bench, weights, or a Pullup bar, but can often include climbing-specific training equipment such as a campus board or hangboards. Climbing gyms often have equipment related to calisthenics and bodyweight training, including Resistance bands, dip belts, and rings.\nClimbing equipment.\nClimbing gyms have a lot of equipment dedicated to climbing. Most gyms, regardless of the type of climbing they are designed for, will offer climbing shoes for rent. Climbing gyms that offer sport climbing will also offer harnesses, ropes, and belay devices. Some climbers may bring other equipment, such as chalk bags or liquid chalk. Most climbing gyms offer rent of necessary equipment, and some have shops which allow the purchase of equipment. Other equipment which may be on offer includes finger tape or helmets.\nSafety.\nClimbing is a dangerous sport which can cause many injuries. To mitigate this, climbing gyms have equipment and precautions in place to ensure safety.\nPolicies.\nSafety policies are the practices and rules enforced by a climbing gym to ensure the safety of its climbers. This may include supervision, ensuring that unsupervised climbers have enough experience to keep themselves safe, or rules to dissuade dangerous behavior, such as walking under climbers or jumping from high bouldering walls. Climbing gyms often have lessons for people to learn climbing safety and technique.\nEquipment.\nClimbing gyms have equipment designed to keep people safe. This includes harnesses to avoid dangerous falls, padded floors around bouldering walls to soften landings, and extra holds designed to help people to climb down from the top of difficult climbs.\nHistory.\nThe first climbing holds and walls were designed for climbers to keep training during the winter. Early walls and holds evolved in the late 1970s and early 1980s from wood strips screwed to garage walls, glued rocks, and other improvisations. The first 'modern' molded plastic holds with a bolt in the middle were created by French climber François Savigny in 1983, sparking a nascent industry.\nThe first facility that would be recognized as a climbing gym today was established in Seattle, Washington by climbers Rich Johnston and Dan Cauthorn in January 1987. The gym, called Vertical Club, was created with a $14,000 budget with the aid of the local community, by gluing rocks onto the walls.\nClimbing with a Disability.\nParaclimbing.\nParaclimbing is a form of adaptive climbing that allows individuals with physical disabilities to enjoy the sport of rock climbing. It involves using a variety of techniques and equipment modifications to accommodate different abilities, such as prosthetics, harnesses, and ropes. Paraclimbing is a rapidly growing sport that is gaining recognition on a global scale and is now included in major climbing competitions, including the Paralympic Games.\nParaclimbing is a sport that not only challenges physical limitations but also promotes mental strength and resilience. Climbers are required to use their problem-solving skills to navigate various climbing routes, which can be mentally and physically demanding. The sport has different categories based on the nature of the disability, including visual impairment, upper limb amputations, lower limb amputations, neurological impairment, autism, and intellectual impairment.\nParaclimbing Categories.\nParaclimbing categories are based on the nature of the disability. Here are the different categories of Paraclimbing:\nVisually impaired: The visually impaired category is for climbers who have a visual impairment, including total blindness or partial vision loss. Climbers in this category usually have a sighted partner who helps them navigate the climbing route. The sighted partner communicates with the climber and provides information on the route's features, such as the location of hand and foot holds. This category requires good communication and teamwork between the climber and their sighted partner.\nUpper limb amputee: This category is for climbers who have lost one or both arms or hands. Climbers in this category use specialized prosthetics or adaptive equipment to climb. The sighted partner communicates with the climber and provides information on the route's features, such as the location of hand and foot holds. The sighted partner also helps ensure the climber's safety by guiding them towards the top of the route.\nLower limb amputee: This category is for climbers who have lost one or both legs or feet. Climbers in this category use specialized prosthetics or adaptive equipment to climb. These prosthetics or adaptive equipment help the climber maintain their balance and stability while climbing. Climbers in this category also use a technique known as \"heel hooking,\" which involves using the heel of their prosthetic foot to hook onto a hold and maintain their balance.\nNeurological impairment: This category is for climbers with neurological conditions, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injuries. Depending on their specific condition, climbers may utilize adaptive equipment or rely on their upper body strength to climb\nAutism: The autism category is for climbers with autism spectrum disorder. Climbers in this category may have difficulty with sensory processing and may require additional support and accommodation. Climbers in this category require patience, understanding, and support to navigate the climbing route effectively.\nIntellectual impairment: This category is specifically designed for climbers who have intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disabilities can encompass a wide range of cognitive impairments, which may affect an individual's ability to learn, reason, problem-solve, or adapt to new situations. As a result, climbers in this category may face unique challenges while participating in paraclimbing. To ensure a supportive and inclusive environment for climbers with intellectual disabilities, additional support and accommodations may be necessary to successfully navigate the climbing route. This may include individualized coaching, tailored instructions, or the use of visual aids to help the climber understand and follow the route."

The Northern Utah League's charter franchises based in Brigham City, Utah (Brigham City \"Peaches\"), Lewiston, Idaho (Lewiston Broncs), Logan, Utah (Logan Collegians), Ogden, Utah (Ogden) and Smithfield, Utah (Smithfield) joined Tremonton, in the newly formed league.\nReports and a team photograph refer to the 1921 Tremonton team nickname as the \"Bears.\"\nThe \"Bears\" moniker would likely be a reference to Tremonton's location within the Bear River Valley. Tremonton was founded in 1888 and is the largest city within the Bear River Valley.\nTremonton began Northern Utah League began play on May 4, 1921, as the league played a split season schedule. The second half began on July 4, 1921. The six–team league overall standings consisted of Brigham City (7–9), the Lewiston Broncs (4–11), Logan Collegians (8–9), Ogden (11–5), Smithfield (6–10) and Tremonton (12–4). With their 12–4 record, Tremonton had the best record in the league. It was reported that Tremonton finished 15–5 in the second half standings to again finish in first place in the standings.\nRecords conflict, but reports in the \"1921 Northern Utah League Summary\" by Ray Olson, the league secretary, have the Brigham City \"Peaches\" winning the overall championship after winning the first half with a 12–4 records. Reportedly, Tremonton won the second half, beating Ogden in a three–game playoff series after the two clubs finished the season tied for first place with 15–5 records. Tremonton pitcher Franklin Coray reportedly defeated Ogden in the first game, throwing a no–hitter in a 2–0 victory. In a five–game series for the league title, the Brigham Peaches reportedly defeated the Tremonton \"Bears\" 3 games to 2.\nIn a game on July 3, 1921, Ogden pitcher Dave Davenport pitched a perfect game in a 4–0 Ogden victory over Tremonton. Davenport was later released for being too dominant in the Northern Utah League, with a 7–0 record.\nReports show Tremonton player Spencer Adams leading the Northern Utah League in batting average, hitting .431.\nThe Northern Utah League permanently folded as a minor league following the 1921 season. Tremonton, Utah has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe name of the 1921 Tremonton home minor league ballpark is not directly referenced. Schuman Park was in use in the era, having been founded in 1906 as the first city park in the city. It was named after John Schuman, a founder of Tremonton. Schuman sold his property to the city at a price of $50.00 to establish the park. Schuman Park is still in use today as a public park with amenities. It is located at 220 North Tremont Street."

The team has played in three McCaw Cup finals and in two U Sports national tournaments, in 2022 and 2023. The team is led by head coach Darren Turcotte, a former NHL forward and North Bay Sports Hall of Fame member.\nHistory.\nPrior to their entry to U Sports (formerly Canadian Interuniversity Sport), the Lakers had fielded a women's ice hockey team that played in the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association. On June 26, 2012, it was announced that the women's ice hockey team would compete in Ontario University Athletics beginning with the 2013-14 season. After conducting a search for a head coach for the team's first foray into the OUA, it was announced on August 16, 2012, that Darren Turcotte had been hired for the position for the 2013-14 season.

The Huskies represented the University of Connecticut and were coached by Mike Cavanaugh, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Connecticut's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nUConn began the season going through a gauntlet or ranked teams. The stiff competition handed the Huskies a 1–4–1 record and left the team with wallowing near the bottom of the conference standings. Despite the bad start, Connecticut turned its season around with a solid performance in January. While facing a slightly easier schedule, the Huskies ended the month a game over .500 and, after defeating Northeastern at the start of February, the team found itself in the top-20. The ranking didn't last long, however, and Connecticut's 4-game losing streak nearly ended any hope for the team. Winning the last two games of the regular season put the Huskies at .500 and, because Hockey East used a power index for ranking for the 2021 season, UConn finished 4th in the conference, the best result to date.\nIn spite of their mediocre record, Connecticut had a small chance to receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament but it would need a good performance to make itself stand out from the other 'bubble teams'. They got a good chance in the conference quarterfinals, facing Providence at home. The Huskies started slow and were badly outshot in the first period. When they did finally score the Friars had already built a 3-oal lead and their opponents cruised to a 6–1 victory.\nDarion Hanson, Ryan Keane, Matt Pasquale, and Bradley Stone sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher who currently plays for the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball.\nEarly baseball career.\nMasashi started as a little league pitcher for the Yokoshiba Phoenix baseball team in his hometown in Chiba. He continued to pitch for Yokoshibahikari Junior High, and helped his team win the prefectural championship in his 3rd year.\nHe entered Yokohama High School in the neighboring prefecture of Kanagawa, where he became the baseball team's ace pitcher in his 2nd year. He helped his school make it all the way to the 2013 Summer Koshien tournaments, where he pitched a complete game (14 KOs, 1 earned run) to defeat Marugame High in the 2nd round. But due to overexertion in this game, he strained his shoulders and they lost the next round to Toko Gakuen. They also made it to the 2014 Spring Koshien, but got defeated in the first round when he gave away 7 runs.\nAfter high school, he returned to Chiba to enroll in International Budo University, where he joined the baseball team as a reliever. He eventually became the team's ace in his 2nd year and participated in the Sendai Big-Six league tournaments. In addition to notching 6 wins including 3 shutouts in league games, he was selected to play for the national team during the 2019 Japan-USA Collegiate Baseball Championship series. In his 3rd year, he was again selected to play for Samurai Japan in the Baseball at the 2017 Summer Universiade where Japan finished first. In the league games, he won 4 titles including league MVP and most pitching wins, and contributed to his team finishing 2nd overall. But due to an injury in his pitching arm at the start of his senior year, he got very little play time and his prospects of getting drafted after graduation became very slim. He finished college with a record of 24–5, 92 KOs and a 1.92 ERA in 50 league appearances. \nWhen he went undrafted, he joined JR East to play in the industrial leagues. In his first year, despite pitching 3 scoreless innings in relief during the 2019 Intercity Baseball Tournament, their team lost due to run deficit. After this, he began weight training to improve his overall strength. On October 5, 2020 during the Tokyo-wide eliminations, he almost pitched a no-hitter against NTT East Japan right until the bottom of the 9th. He earned a complete shutout win and finished the game after surrendering only a single hit. After he got drafted by the Tigers in November, he also pitched another complete win (2 earned runs) against soon-to-be Tigers teammate Takumu Nakano of Mitsubishi Motors Okazaki during the intercity tournament, but his team lost in the succeeding round.\nHanshin Tigers.\nHe was the Tiger's 2nd round pick during the November 2020 Nippon Professional Baseball draft. He signed a 70 million yen contract with Hanshin, for an estimated annual salary of 13 million yen. He was assigned jersey number 27.\nPitching Style.\nA 5'10 southpaw pitcher with three quarters delivery, he throws a four-seam fastball as his main pitch (maxed at ), coupled with a cutter, a two-seamer, slider and an occasional forkball and changeup. He has been shown to have good control in throwing low trajectory pitches."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career games played as a third baseman leaders",
        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, before a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. Third base is the third of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner in order to score a run for that player's team. A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest third base and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.\nBecause third basemen routinely have to make the longest throws across the infield, and because of increasing expectations of their offensive contributions, they tend to be physically larger than middle infielders; however, they are generally expected to be quicker than first basemen, and the physical demands of playing third base have historically hindered players from having long careers at the position. When Eddie Yost became the first player to play 2,000 major league games at third base in 1962, it was nearly forty years after most other non-pitching positions had seen a player reach that milestone; the only position that took longer was catcher. Only 13 players have played 2,000 major league games at third base, tied for the fewest among infield positions; only three of the top 25 career leaders were in the major leagues before 1944, none of them before 1920. Brooks Robinson is the all-time leader in career games as a third baseman, playing 2,870 games at the position; it is the most games played at a single position by any player in major league history, and exceeded the previous record at the position by nearly 700 games. Adrián Beltré (2,759), Graig Nettles (2,412), Gary Gaetti (2,282), Wade Boggs (2,215), Mike Schmidt (2,212), Buddy Bell (2,183), Eddie Mathews (2,181), Ron Santo (2,130), Aramis Ramírez (2,112), Tim Wallach (2,054), Scott Rolen (2,023), and Eddie Yost (2,008) are the only other players to appear in over 2,000 career games at third base."

The Terriers represented Boston University and were coached by Albie O'Connell, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Boston University's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDue to COVID-19, the start to BU's season was delayed until even later than most schools. The Terriers weren't able to play their first game until January 8, but once they did make it onto the ice, Boston University performed very well. The Terriers won 9 out of 11 games and shot up the Hockey East standings despite playing much fewer games than their colleagues. As the team progressed BU was also hit by the injury bug. Ty Amonte, who missed the entire previous season due to an injury, was lost after just 2 games. During the season two of the team's top players, Drew Commesso and David Farrance, both were lost for several games but BU continued to find a way to win.\nFurther cancellations and delays limited the team to just 14 games in the regular season. In spite of their limited schedule, BU finished the season second place in Hockey East and was ranked in the middle of the top-20. The program was all but guaranteed a berth into the NCAA Tournament with their 10–3–1 record, which proved fortunate as the team lost its opening game in the conference quarterfinals. The Terriers were rather lackluster in the playoff match, recording just 17 shots on goal for the game and losing 1–2.\nAs predicted, Boston University was selected for the tournament. They were given the 3-seed in the Northeast region and set to face St. Cloud State in the opening round. BU managed to kill off a 5-minute major in the first period to keep the game scoreless and then opened the second with a goal after just 8 seconds. The Huskies responded with two goals in rapid succession but Boston University tied the game less than two minutes later. St. Cloud got a second lead before the period was out and the two entered the final frame with both still very much in contention. Despite a push by the Terriers, the team was unable to get any of their 16 shots into the net while St. Cloud State scored three more times and ended with a 6–2 victory over BU.\nJohn Copeland sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | "

        "text": "The Atlantic team was a minor league baseball team based in Atlantic, Iowa. In 1903, the Atlantic team played as members of the Class D level Southwest Iowa League, winning the league championship in their only season of play. Atlantic was without a known nickname, hosting minor league home games at the Atlantic City Park.\nHistory.\nAtlantic, Iowa first hosted minor league baseball when the \"Atlantic\" team became members of the Southwest Iowa League, which began play on May 29, 1903. Atlantic would win the championship of the short–lived league. The Southwest Iowa League was established at a January 26, 1903, meeting held in Shenandoah, Iowa where a board of directors was established. Original plans called for an eight–team league, with clubs to be formed among several interested Iowa towns and two Nebraska cities: Nebraska City and Plattsmouth. At the January 26 meeting, it was established that interested cities needed to apply for membership and provide a $100 application fee. \nOn March 25, 1903, the new league was formalized at a meeting held at the Hotel Johnson in Red Oak, Iowa. The new league was officially named the \"Southwest Iowa League\" and E.H. Whiteside, of Atlantic, Iowa was elected president. At the conclusion of the meeting, Four Iowa teams in Atlantic, Clarinda, Iowa, Shenandoah and Red Oak were ultimately chosen as the charter member franchises. Council Bluffs, Iowa and Nebraska City were originally selected for membership, but backed out when it was decided to disallow playing games on Sunday. Glenwood, Iowa and Malvern, Iowa could not raise the application fees. Creston, Iowa was concerned about the league's $400 monthly salary limit and declined to field a team.\nThe Atlantic team played under managers Fred Jarrott and W.E. Fulmer. The Southwest Iowa League was a Class D level league and teams were structured to play a 42–game season schedule, with two home games at home and two road games each week. Ten percent of gate receipts were to go to the league. The remaining revenue was to be divided 60/40 between the home team and visitors. Home teams were to provide local umpires. The early 1903 season was greatly affected by rainy weather. After resuming play, Creston fielded team that played competitively against Shenandoah in two exhibition games outside of league play.\nAfter beginning the 1903 season as a four–team league, the Southwest Iowa League expanded to a six–team league during the season. At a June 25, 1903 meeting, umpiring selection was taken over by the league, while the Creston Cyclones and a team from Osceola, Iowa were selected to join the league as expansion teams. However, as the league continued play, the Shenandoah, Iowa franchise folded on July 18, 1903, weeks after winning the Southwest Iowa League first half championship with a 13–5 record. Shenandoah had a 22–14 overall record at the time they folded. During the season, Atlantic protested an August 15 game against Creston due to umpiring. The newly formed Creston Cyclones franchise permanently folded on August 29, 1903, with a 24–19 overall record. Atlantic won the second half title and had the 1903 Southwest Iowa League's best overall record, placing first with a 34–26 record, finishing 3.5 games ahead of the second place Clarinda team and 9.5 games ahead of the third place Red Oak Blue Indians.\nThe Southwest Iowa League permanently folded after the 1903 regular season and had no playoffs. On August 28, 1903, Red Oak had failed to appear to play a game at Atlantic and announced their intention to fold. Umpiring concerns, game protest disputes and financial struggles plagued the league and it permanently folded on August 29, 1903.\nAtlantic, Iowa has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Atlantic team played 1903 minor league home games at the Atlantic City Park. City Park is still in use today as a public park. The location is 10 West 7th Street in Atlantic, Iowa."

He was the Boroughmuir club's second Scotland international player (after Ken Ross in 1961).\nAdministrative career.\nWatson was a Director and then Chief Executive at the Scottish Rugby Union from 2000 to 2003. He was sacked as Chief Executive in 2003 as part of management shake-up. It came after under-performance from the national team and the professional clubs. Earlier that year Glasgow Warriors lost Jason White to Sale Sharks with Watson admitting that the Warriors could not compete with the English club in the cash stakes.\nHe was a Director at Boroughmuir from 2012 to 2019. He handed over the role of director of finance to Alice Shek in 2018, becoming vice president of the club.\nIt was while Watson was a director of the club that Boroughmuir instigated the Bill Watson Youth Rugby Bursary Programme. It was backed by the Microtech Group in a four year deal. It was to cover all the costs of playing rugby for the youngsters, including touring. Watson stated:\nI’m delighted that we can actively support the next generation of talented young people to get as much enjoyment out of rugby as I have, without any financial worries. The support from Microtech Group will go a long way in helping our young talent to fulfill their potential, whether that’s playing rugby for pleasure or going on to play the game professionally.\nFamily.\nWatson's brother George Watson played as Lock. He also played at Boroughmuir and was capped by Edinburgh District. Unlucky not to receive a full senior cap for Scotland, he was named in Alan Lorimer's selection for Scotland's best uncapped team."

In January 2022, Cricket Australia updated the tour schedule, to reduce the risks of COVID-19 by minimising travel across the country.\nAustralia won the opening match by 20 runs, after a rain delay reduced Sri Lanka's innings to 19 overs. In January 2022, the International Cricket Council made changes to the T20I playing conditions, including an in-match penalty for a slow over rate. If the team who is fielding does not start to bowl their final over in the allocated time, they will only be allowed to have four fielders outside the inner circle, and not five. In the second T20I match of the series, Sri Lanka became the first team to incur the new penalty, after not bowling their overs in time. The match ended in a tie, with Australia winning the Super Over. Australia won the third T20I by six wickets, winning the series with two matches to play. Australia also won the fourth match by six wickets, taking a 4–0 lead in the series. Sri Lanka won the final T20I match by five wickets with Australia winning the series 4–1.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Australia added Daniel Sams to their T20I squad, replacing Travis Head. Head played in the 2021–22 Sheffield Shield season, before he joined the team for the final T20Is in Melbourne.

The series was played at five venues across Australia from 8 December 2021 and was scheduled to finish on 18 January 2022. \nAustralia were the defending holders of the Ashes going into the series, having won in 2017–18 and drawn in 2019. The series was part of the 2021–2023 ICC World Test Championship.\nAustralia won the series 4–0, retaining The Ashes after winning the first three Test matches. While the fourth Test ended in a draw, Australia comfortably won the fifth Test.\nSquads.\nOn 25 October 2021, Ben Stokes was added to England's squad. On 7 December 2021, James Anderson was left out of the first Test as a precaution, despite being declared fit to play. On 7 January 2022, Sam Billings was added to the squad as injury cover. Jos Buttler was ruled out of England's squad for the fifth Test, after breaking a finger during the fourth Test.\nOn 17 November 2021, Cricket Australia named a 15-member squad for the first two Test matches. On 19 November 2021, Tim Paine resigned from the captaincy role and, on 26 November 2021, was replaced by Pat Cummins as captain with Steve Smith as Cummins' deputy. Paine then withdrew from the squad and announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from cricket. On 2 December 2021, Alex Carey was added to Australia's squad as Paine's replacement and a wicket-keeper, receiving his maiden Test call-up in the process. Ahead of the second Test, Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of Australia's squad due to a side strain picked up during the first Test of the series. Pat Cummins was ruled out of the second Test after being named as a close contact of a positive COVID-19 case; Steve Smith was made captain, and Michael Neser made his Test debut for Australia. During the fifth day of the second Test, Cricket Australia named an unchanged squad for the rest of the series. Ahead of the third Test, Australia also added Scott Boland to their squad as a cover for their fast bowlers. \nCOVID-19 impact.\nThe 2021–22 Ashes series took place against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which threatened to derail the series numerous times. As far back as June 2021, concerns had been raised that key England players could pull out of the tour if their families were not able to accompany them due to the Australian government's restrictions on international travel. \nOn the morning of the first day of the second Test, Australian captain Pat Cummins was ruled out of the match after he was deemed to be a close contact of someone with COVID-19. In mid-December, a number of people at the match at Adelaide Oval tested positive, including members of the media.\nOn 31 December 2021, Travis Head was ruled out of the fourth Test due to contracting COVID-19. Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis were added to the squad as additional cover. Several key staff and officials, including ICC match referee David Boon and England coach Chris Silverwood were also forced to miss the fourth Test; Boon had tested positive for COVID-19 while Silverwood was forced to isolate with his family following an outbreak of the virus in the England camp.\nVenues.\nIn May 2021, Cricket Australia (CA) announced that The Gabba, the Adelaide Oval, the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Perth Stadium would host the Test matches. However, in late November 2021, doubts were raised about the final Test taking place in Perth due to COVID-19 restrictions. Mark McGowan, the premier of Western Australia, insisted on a 14-day quarantine period for everyone travelling into the state. On 6 December 2021, CA confirmed the fifth Test would not be held in Perth, and that the relocated Test would be played as a day/night match. On 11 December 2021, CA confirmed that the venue for the fifth Test match would be the Bellerive Oval, in Hobart. This was the first ever Ashes Test match to be played in Hobart.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nDay one.\nRory Burns was bowled for a golden duck by Mitchell Starc off the first ball of the series. Dawid Malan was caught behind by Alex Carey from a delivery by Josh Hazlewood. Captain Joe Root followed with a duck after getting caught at first slip by David Warner from a delivery by Hazlewood. Ben Stokes was only able to score five runs before being caught out off a delivery by Pat Cummins. Ultimately, England was dismissed for 147 in their first innings. Although England was all out before tea, Australia were unable to begin their first innings due to weather.\nDay two.\nMarcus Harris was only able to score three runs before being dismissed by Ollie Robinson. Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Green were dismissed in quick succession, going four for 29. England were unable to capitalise on three close opportunities to dismiss David Warner on 17, 48, and 60. Warner was able to score 94 runs before being caught out off a delivery by Robinson. Green was bowled out by Robinson in one ball. Australia ended the day 7/343. Travis Head was not out, having scored 112 runs with twelve fours and two sixes.\nDay three.\nAustralia were all out before lunch, with Travis Head bowled out off a yorker from Mark Wood. Australia's run total for the innings was 425, with Head contributing 152. Haseeb Hameed and Rory Burns were the first two batsmen for England's second innings. Burns was called out lbw with zero runs, but the call was overturned by DRS. Burns was later dismissed for 13 and Hameed soon followed, being dismissed for 27. The next two batsmen, Dawid Malan and Joe Root, ended the day not out with 80 and 86 runs, respectively. As a result, England ended the day trailing Australia by 58 runs.\nDay four.\nDespite strong performances in day three, Malan and Root were only able to add two and three runs on day four before falling. Ollie Pope was the next to fall after being caught at the slip. The global broadcast from The Gabba was then cut off for approximately 30 minutes while the Test continued. After the broadcast was able to return, Stokes edged a ball from Pat Cummins and was caught out in the gully, leaving England 6/266. The next four batsmen, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Ollie Robinson, and Mark Wood, were dismissed in quick succession, ending the innings. In total, England scored 297 with eight wickets and only 77 runs in day four.\nWith a target of 20 runs, Australia opened their second innings with Alex Carey and Marcus Harris. Carey was dismissed, but Harris was able to reach the target score before Australia's third batsman faced a ball.\nSecond Test.\nDay one.\nDespite testing negative to COVID-19, Pat Cummins was forced to withdraw from the match and isolate in accordance with the South Australian government's public health regulations. Steve Smith was appointed Australian captain for the first time since his comeback from the Sandpapergate incident, while Michael Neser was named as Cummins' replacement and hastily awarded his baggy green. \nSmith won the toss and decided to bat first. Marcus Harris and David Warner opened the batting for the home team. However, Harris was out soon, caught by England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler off the bowling of Stuart Broad. Marnus Labuschagne and Warner stabilized the innings putting on a partnership of 172 runs for the second wicket before Warner was out for 95, falling five short of a century, caught by Broad off the bowling of Ben Stokes. Australia ended the day at 225 for two, with Labuschagne remaining not out at 95 (having been dropped twice by Buttler on 21 and 95) and Smith on 18 not out.\nDay two.\nEarly in the day, Labuschagne reached his sixth test hundred with a controlled edge past second slip to the boundary. Having come off 287 balls, it was the slowest Test century by an Australian since Jason Gillespie's effort against Bangladesh in 2006. He was dismissed LBW shortly afterward on 103 by Ollie Robinson, offering no shot to a delivery. Australia reviewed the decision, however, the decision by the on-field umpire stayed. Travis Head joined the captain Smith at the wicket and the duo put on fifty runs for the fourth wicket before Head was bowled off a full toss from the bowling of English captain Joe Root. Cameron Green came to the crease but was back to the pavilion adding only two runs. Australia were at 294 for five. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey joined Smith to put on 91 runs for the sixth wicket before Smith was out leg before to James Anderson for 93. Australia reviewed the decision but the on-field umpire's decision stayed as an 'umpire's call'. Carey brought up his fifty before being out for 51 caught at cover by Haseeb Hameed off the bowling of Anderson. Australia brought up their 450 before declaring for 473 at the loss of 9 wickets.\nEngland opened their innings with Hameed and Rory Burns, both of whom were out for single digit scores bringing England to a total of 12 runs for the loss of two wickets. Hameed was out for 6 runs caught at mid-on by Mitchell Starc off the bowling of Michael Neser, while Burns was out for 4 runs caught by Smith at second slip off the bowling of Starc. England ended the day at 17 for two with Dawid Malan remaining not out at one and Joe Root remaining not out at 5.\nDay three.\nMalan and Root resumed from their overnight positions and carried their bats through the first session with England getting to lunch at 140 runs for the loss of no additional wickets. Malan was unbeaten at 58 while Root was unbeaten at 40. Root was the first to be dismissed for 62 runs out caught by Smith at first slip off the bowling of Green. England were 150 for the loss of three wickets. Malan followed soon with the team adding 7 runs before Malan was out for 80 runs caught by Smith again at first slip off the bowling of Starc. England lost their next six wickets within 79 runs folding for a total of 236 runs. For the Australians Starc took four wickets conceding 37 runs, while spinner Nathan Lyon took three wickets conceding 58 runs.\nAustralia chose not to enforce the follow-on and ended the day 45 for one, with Warner run-out in a mixup with batsman Harris, with a combination of Broad and Buttler dislodging the stumps. Harris remained unbeaten at 21 while Neser was not out having scored two runs.\nDay four.\nEngland took the field without Root, who was being treated for a lower abdominal injury sustained in the warm up session. Stokes took over as captain during Root's brief absence. Despite this setback, England started the day well, dismissing Neser, Harris and then the captain Smith in quick succession to have Australia 55 for four. But then Robinson, who had taken two of the day's wickets, switched from seam bowling to off-spin, presumably to lift the over rate. Root returned soon afterwards to the field, but by that time Australia had steadied, Head having combined with Labuschagne and helping Australia end the first session 134 for four, leading by 371 runs.\nHead was first to depart when play resumed, caught by Stokes at deep square leg off Robinson; his 51 had come off only 54 deliveries. Labuschagne also reached a half-century to back up his mighty first-innings effort before departing, also for 51, caught by Stokes (this time fielding at deep mid wicket) off the part-time leg spin of Malan, his first test wicket. Although wickets continued to fall at regular intervals, the remaining batters continued to add runs and when Smith declared at 230 for nine after Richardson had been dismissed, England had been set a winning target of 468 in the remaining four sessions.\nEngland resumed their second innings chasing a target of 468 runs and were immediately down a wicket when Hameed was out for a duck caught by the wicketkeeper Carey off the bowling of Jhye Richardson. Malan joined Burns and the duo put on 44 runs before Malan was out for 20 runs leg before to Neser. Burns and Root followed soon after with England ending the day at 82 runs for the loss of four wickets.\nDay five.\nChasing a stiff target, England were at 142 runs for six wickets at dinner with Buttler at 16 and Chris Woakes at 28. The duo added 61 runs for the seventh wicket before Woakes was out for 44 runs out, bowled Richardson. Buttler, having faced 207 deliveries, trod on his stumps trying to work a cut behind square; his was the ninth wicket and England were all out for 192. Australia won the game by 275 runs, going 2-0 up in the five-match series. Labuschagne was named player of the match for his century in the first innings and half century in the second innings, while Richardson was the pick of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 42 runs.\nThird Test.\nDay one.\nEngland made four changes to its team, with Jonny Bairstow, Zak Crawley, Jack Leach and Mark Wood replacing Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Ollie Pope and Chris Woakes. Australia also made some changes, with Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser making way for Pat Cummins returning as captain, and debutant Scott Boland, a local boy who became only the fourth Indigenous Australian cricketer to play at Test level. After the start of play was delayed by rain, England's batting woes at the top of the order continued, with Cummins having dismissed openers Hameed and Crawley with only 13 runs on the board. It was yet again up to Root and Malan to rescue the innings, and the pair added 48 runs before Malan lost his wicket on the last ball before lunch, caught in the slips by Warner off Cummins for 14. England's score was 61 for three.\nEngland found themselves in trouble early in the Test after being bowled out with 185 runs.\nWarner and Harris gave Australia its best start of the series, combining for an opening stand of 57 in 14 overs before Warner fell for a brisk 38 (off 42 balls) when a thick edge off Anderson was caught by Crawley at gully. Lyon was sent in as nightwatchman for the remaining two overs as Australia ended the day's play at 61 for one.\nDay two.\nThe start of the second day was delayed by half an hour after it was revealed that four non-playing members of the England squad – two support staff and two family members – had tested positive to COVID-19. Australia increased their run total to 267 before being bowled out. Anderson claimed three more wickets to bring his total to 4/33 in the first innings.\nEngland once again found themselves in trouble early in the innings. Mitchell Starc dismissed Zak Crawley and Dawid Malan on consecutive deliveries in the fifth over. In the eleventh over, Scott Boland dismissed Haseeb Hameed and Jack Leach in three balls. Day two ended with England 4/31 and trailing Australia by 51 runs.\nDay three.\nIn the fifth over of the day, Starc bowled Ben Stokes out with England at 5/46. Boland dismissed the next four batsmen (Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Mark Wood, and Ollie Robinson) with ducks from Wood and Robinson. Cameron Green bowled James Anderson out to end the Test with Australia winning by an innings and 14 runs. England's score of 68 runs was their lowest innings score on Australian soil since 1904; their previous lowest had also come at the MCG.\nBoland earned the Mullagh Medal after taking six wickets for seven runs during England's second innings.\nFourth Test.\nDay one.\nEarlier, Travis Head was ruled out of the fourth Test due to contracting COVID-19. Thus, Usman Khawaja replaced Head in the Australian playing 11 and he was the only change in Australian side. England made one change with Stuart Broad replacing Ollie Robinson. Usman Khawaja was playing his first test match in more than 2 years. Only 46.5 overs of play was possible due to frequent rain interruption. Australian opening pair built a 50 run partnership before Broad dismissed Warner for 30. Anderson and Wood chipped in with a wicket each as well, and Australia ended the day with 3/126 with Khawaja (4*) and Smith (6*) on strike.\nDay two.\nKhawaja and Smith continued to pile up runs and built a century partnership with Smith scoring Half-century. Then, Broad provided the breakthrough for English with dismissing Smith for 67 and breaking the 115-run stand. Usman Khawaja then went on to score his 9th test century on his comeback test . Handy contributions from Pat Cummins, Starc and Lyon down the order ensured that Aussies total crossed 400. Cummins declared the innings on 8/416 for 134 overs in the final session of play and put England to bat for 5 overs in the day. Stuart Broad registered a five- wicket haul (5/101). England ended day 2 unscathed with scoring 0/13 in 5 overs, in which 9 runs came as extras.\nDay three.\nDay three of SCG test was observed as Jane McGrath day to create awareness about Breast cancer and to raise funds for McGrath foundation. Starc broke the opening partnership early on the day and then other pacers joined the party and made England reeling at 4/36 on Lunch with England losing 3 wickets for no run in a space of 6 overs. Then Stokes and Bairstow joined forces to perform the rescue act by stitching a 128 run partnership before Nathan Lyon trapped Stokes (66) LBW to break the partnership. Buttler departed soon without troubling the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Bairstow at other end stitched a quickfire 72 run partnership with Mark wood, before Wood departed on 39. Johnny Bairstow then went on to reach triple digit figures in just 138 balls and he became the first England player to score century in this series. England ended the day with 7/258 on board in 70 overs.\nDay four.\nAustralia took only 9 overs to wipe out the English tail to bundle out English at 294 with Boland and Lyon taking the last 3 wickets. Australia began their second innings and Ollie Pope kept the wickets for England instead of Bairstow. Aussies lost Warner early followed by Harris, Labuschagne and Smith who all were dismissed for 20 - odd runs. Australia found themselves in trouble after they were reduced to 4/86 Cameroon Green and Usman Khawaja rebuilt the innings by stitching a mammoth 179 run partnership with Green scoring 74 and Khawaja went on to score another century in his comeback match to extend Australia's lead by 387 before Cummins declared the innings at 5/268 and set England a target of 388. English openers Crawley and Hameed ensured that English didn't loss any wickets by batting out the 11 overs and England ended the day with 0/30 in 11 overs. All 4 results were still possible with England needing 358 to win and Aussies needing 10 wickets to win.\nDay five.\nBoland struck early in the day to break the 46 run opening partnership while Crawley would later go on the register his first half-century in the Ashes. Malan departed for 4 runs followed by Crawley who made 77 runs. Root and Stokes put on a 60 run partnership, but Root was soon bowled by Boland for 24 runs. England reached the tea break at 174/4 with Bairstow and Stokes at the crease, Stokes scoring a half-century. With 36 overs of play in the final session, a draw seemed the most likely result, but Nathan Lyon dismissed Stokes and opened the door for Australia. Cummins later took two wickets in the space of three balls, leaving only three wickets to win in the last 17 overs. Boland would soon dismiss Bairstow for 41 and Australia were just two wickets away. Meanwhile, poor light forced Australia to operate spinners Lyon and Smith from both ends. The 9th wicket partnership batted for almost nine overs before Smith dismissed Leach, his first test wicket since 2016. By that stage, two overs of play remained. Anderson and Broad batted out the last two overs to ensure that the match ended in a draw. Khawaja was named player of the match for his twin centuries in the match.\nStatistics.\nLeading runscorers.\nAbbreviations: \"H / S\" – Highest score in an innings; \"S / R\" – Strike rate: runs per 100 balls faced\nBroadcasting.\nThe series was broadcast on television in Australia by the Seven Network and Fox Sports.

        "text": "The England women's cricket team played against Australia women's cricket team in January and February 2022 to contest the Women's Ashes. The tour consisted of one Women's Test match, three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs), and three Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is). A points-based system was used across all three formats of the tour. Australia were the defending champions, after they won the previous series 12–4 in the points-based system. On 17 January 2022, it was announced that the Decision Review System (DRS) would be used for the first time in the Women's Ashes.\nAs well as the international matches, the respective A teams also played three 20-over and three limited overs matches against each other. On 21 July 2021, Cricket Australia confirmed the fixtures for the A team matches. It was the first time that the England A women's team toured Australia with the England women's team. On 6 January 2022, the tour schedule was brought forward by one week, due to the quarantine requirements in New Zealand for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup.\nAustralia won the opening WT20I match by nine wickets, with Tahlia McGrath making an unbeaten 91 runs and taking three wickets. The next two WT20I matches were both impacted by the weather, with only 4.1 overs being bowled in the second match, and no play at all taking place in the third. Therefore, Australia took a 4–2 lead in the points-based system going into the one-off Women's Test match.\nThe one-off Test match was drawn, after England were set a target of 257 from 48 overs to win on the final day. Described as one of the best Test matches in women's cricket, England required 45 runs to win from ten overs with seven wickets remaining. England finished the match with 245 runs for the loss of nine wickets, just twelve runs short of victory. England captain Heather Knight was named the player of the match for her century in the first innings and match aggregate of 216 runs, with Australia leading the points-based system 6–4 heading into the WODI matches.\nAustralia won the first WODI match by 27 runs, taking an unassailable lead in the points-based system and retaining the Women's Ashes. Australia won the final two WODI matches, to remain unbeaten during the series, and finished the tour 12–4 winners on points. Australia's Tahlia McGrath was named the Player of the Series, after scoring 225 runs and taking 11 wickets.\nSquads.\nAhead of the series, Australia's Beth Mooney suffered a fractured jaw in a training session. As a result, Grace Harris was added to the Australia's Ashes squad, and Courtney Webb was added to the Australia A squad. For the opening A team match, Ashes squad members Hannah Darlington represented Australia A, and Charlie Dean, Tash Farrant, Anya Shrubsole and Mady Villiers all represented England A. On 23 January 2022, Australia's Tayla Vlaeminck was ruled out of the rest of the series due to a stress fracture in her right foot. Two days later, as a result of Vlaeminck's injury, Stella Campbell was added to Australia's squad ahead of the one-off Test match. On the same day, Lauren Bell was added to England's squad for the Test match. Emma Lamb was added to England's WODI squad from the A Team for the final match of the tour."

The winner of the group advances to the final, and the second and third placed teams play in an elimination final. The competition runs alongside the 50-over Hallyburton Johnstone Shield.\nThe current champions are Wellington Blaze, who won the 2023-24 competition and are the most successful team in the history of the competition with eight title wins.\nHistory.\nThe tournament began in 2007–08, as the State League Twenty20. Teams played each other once, with the winner of the group being crowned champions: Canterbury Magicians were the inaugural winners. The following season had a final, in which Wellington Blaze beat defending champions Canterbury.\nThe following season kept the same format, but was known as the New Zealand Cricket Women's Twenty20, with the Central Hinds winning their first title. For the following two seasons, the tournament was known as the Action Cricket Twenty20, before becoming simply the New Zealand Women's Twenty20 Competition until the 2017–18 season. In this period, Wellington and Canterbury won three titles apiece, and one each for Auckland Hearts and Otago Sparks.\nIn 2018–19, the tournament was renamed the Burger King Women's Super Smash, in line with the men's competition. In 2019–20, Dream11 became the sponsors, and an elimination final, a match between the second and third placed teams to advance to the final, was introduced. Wellington Blaze won three titles in a row between 2017–18 and 2019–20, but Canterbury beat them in the final in 2020–21. Wellington regained their title in 2021–22, going unbeaten in the group stage before beating Otago in the final. Canterbury won their sixth title in 2022–23, beating Wellington in the final after finishing third in the group stage. Wellington Blaze claimed their eighth title after defeating Central Hinds in the 2023–24 final."

The Fighting Irish represented the University of Notre Dame and were coached by Jeff Jackson, in his 16th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Notre Dame's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nNotre Dame had an up and down season, routinely following up stellar performances with disappointing efforts. The team hovered around the bottom of the top-20 for most of the season and were never more than 2 games away from a .500 record. After alternating multi-game winning streaks through January and February, Notre Dame was ranked #19 and there was belief that the Irish could make the NCAA Tournament despite being just 14–12–2. A solid performance in their conference tournament would definitely improve the team's chances, and with the Fighting Irish hosting the entire tournament their odds were even better. Unfortunately, the team laid an egg in the opening game against Penn State and lost 3–6.\nNotre Dame could only watch and hope but when St. Lawrence won the ECAC Tournament it appeared that the door had shut on Notre Dame's season. In less than 24 hours everything changed; St. Lawrence's head coach tested positive for COVID-19 the following day and the team was forced to withdraw from the national tournament. The ECAC automatic bid was given to Quinnipiac (who were likely to make the tournament anyway), opening up one more spot in the bracket. The final open spot came down essentially to how schools performed against the best teams in their conference; Notre Dame splitting their season series against Michigan and Minnesota gave them the edge and the Fighting Irish received the final at-large bid.\nWhile the team's selection was not without controversy, the Fighting Irish lost the ability to prove they were the right choice when members of the team tested positive for COVID-19. Because their withdrawal happened two days before the game had been scheduled, there was no opportunity for another team to be installed as a replacement and the match was declared a 'no contest'.\nBrady Bjork, Ryan Carmichael and Christian DiCesare sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Kristoffersen, in fact, had gotten off to a huge lead over the field in the middle of the season. However, after failing to finish a slalom in Chamonix, Kristoffersen was clinging to just a two-point lead in this discipline over Clément Noël of France (who won the race), with three races still remaining on the schedule. But then a race in Japan was canceled due to high winds, followed by the season finale scheduled for Cortina d'Ampezzo being cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally, the race scheduled in Kranjska Gora was also cancelled by the pandemic.\nThe cancellations handed the season title in slalom (as well as the title in giant slalom) to Kristoffersen without the expected showdown.\nStandings.\nUpdated at 21 March 2020 after all events."

The Zimbabwe Cricket's Director of Cricket Hamilton Masakadza stated, \"The importance of the Zimbabwe A team cannot be overemphasised and, needless to say, we couldn’t be happier to have the boys finally back in action.\" He added, \"Playing regularly at this level will help our players bridge the gap between domestic cricket and the international game. We are grateful to Cricket South Africa for accepting our invitation and we are looking forward to an exciting, competitive series between the two sides.\"\nThe unofficial ODI series were used by South Africa as the preparation for their away series against the West Indies in June 2021. Cricket South Africa’s convenor of selectors Victor Mpitsang said, \"We are pleased to have our ‘A’ team playing again. This is vital for the growth of our next tier of players who have been starved of international experience of late.\" Mpitsang added, \"The one-day series in particular will act as match preparation for our Proteas who will be taking part in the white-ball leg of the tour to the West Indies.\"\nThe second unofficial Test match was suspended due to the COVID-19 restrictions set by the Zimbabwean government. Zimbabwe's Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) instructed an end to all sporting activities from 14 June 2021. In response, Zimbabwe Cricket agreed to put a stop to all cricket activities but would appeal the government for the fixture to be completed in a bio-secure environment and to permit the national men's team to continue preparations for the home series against Bangladesh and the tour of Ireland in August.\nSeries summary.\nSouth Africa A won the inaugural match of the bilateral List A series by 6 wickets while chasing the target of 320. An unbeaten century by Theunis de Bruyn helped South Africa A make a strong start to their tour of Zimbabwe as they comfortably beat their hosts by six wickets. Bruyn smashed 113 runs off just 64 balls which led the visitors to conquer the match despite being punished from Tadiwanashe Marumani's 82 off 73 and Dion Myers's 96 off 91 balls. While in the second match, despite another fighting innings from Dion Myers, who scored 70 in excellent style, Zimbabwe A went down to another heavy defeat, by 184 runs, at the hands of South Africa A at Harare Sports Club. Ryan Rickelton starred in South Africa's massive victory as he scored his career-best knock of 169 runs. Captain Zubayr Hamza, batting way down at eight, provided handy contributions in the tail end from South Africa when he struck an unbeaten 37 off 17 balls to lift them to a 366 target.\nIn the third rain-affected List A match, Chamu Chibhabha and Milton Shumba's magnificent unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 124 earned Zimbabwe A a fine victory over South Africa A by 22 runs according to the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method. This victory kept Zimbabwe A alive in the series despite losing early four wickets within 46 runs. Chamu Chibhabha's 85 runs off 103 balls, Milton Shumba's 50 runs off 98 balls, and consistent bowling figures of all Zimbabwean bowlers starred in this victory, as South Africa A were losing wickets regularly in the batting innings. In the final List A match, the batting unit of Zimbabwe A again suffered as the visitors seal the one-day series winning the match by 116 runs. Reeza Hendricks slammed 89 runs off 105 balls and Theunis de Bruyn handily contributed in the late overs, which led South Africa A to secure 281 runs in 50 overs. The economic bowling figures of all South African bowlers, with Senuran Muthusamy as the best bower, who bagged 4 wickets for 36 runs as Zimbabwe A were restricted to 165 runs, with more than 11 overs to spare."

They are a member of the American Collegiate Hockey Association at the Division II level. The university sponsored varsity ice hockey from 1926 to 1941.\nHistory.\nBefore the school was even called 'UCLA', the ice hockey program was formed, joining several other local teams including USC and Occidental. The team continued for several years despite the great depression being in full force. In the late 1930s a new arena was built for the Los Angeles programs but World War II forced all of the pacific coast teams to shutter their programs in the early '40s. When teams were reconstituted afterwards, UCLA was not among the programs to resurface and the new arena, the Tropical Ice Gardens, was demolished in 1949.\nUCLA eventually returned to the ice in 1961 but only as a club sport. Until recently, it played against many of its former varsity opponents in the Pac-8.\nCurrently, UCLA plays in the West Coast Hockey Conference in the Tier 1 division against rivals like Loyola Marymount, Long Beach State, Grand Canyon, Northern Arizona, Arizona State, and others. They've made back to back appearances at the ACHA Men's D2 Western Region playoffs. They are currently coached by former player Griffin McCarty, son of the Detroit Red Wings legend Darren McCarty and Sean Allen, a former Hamilton College men's hockey player. \nHistorically, UCLA and USC have faced off in an annual 5-game series dubbed \"The Crosstown Cup\". Up until the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the games took place at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.\nTeam.\nCurrent Roster.\nas of November 19, 2023."

        "text": "The 2020–21 UMass Lowell River Hawks Men's ice hockey season was the 54th season of play for the program, the 38th season competing at the Division I level, and the 37th season in the Hockey East conference. The River Hawks represented the University of Massachusetts Lowell and were coached by Norm Bazin, in his 10th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Massachusetts–Lowell's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nUMass-Lowell was heavily impacted by COVID-19 early in the season. After a delayed start, the team played just 4 games in the first two months of the campaign. Entering their game with UMass on 29 January, Lowell had played just 4 games while the Minutemen had competed in 17. The lack of playing time appeared to hurt the River Hawks since the team, which had been highly ranked entering the season, swiftly fell out of the top-20. UML appeared to regain its form by the end of the regular season, but by then their only path into the NCAA Tournament was with a conference championship. The River Hawks won their first postseason game without much difficulty and entered the quarterfinals having to beat Boston University to stay alive. Despite being on a 4-game unbeaten streak, Owen Savory was replaced as the starting goaltender by freshman Henry Welsch and the move paid off. While he only faced 17 shots in the game, Welsch turned aside all but one and helped Lowell advance to the semifinals. Here the team's run was expected to end as they faced the top ranked team in the nation, Boston College. The Eagles built a 3-goal lead after two periods and looked to be sailing into the championship, but the River Hawks' offense awoke in the third, scoring three times to tie the game. Less than two minutes later, however, BC was again in the lead with a power play goal. Welsch was pulled for an extra attacker and in less than a minute UML had again tied the score. It took another 34 minutes of game time for the winning goal to be scored and UML's Matt Brown netted the biggest goal for the River Hawks all season.\nLowell faced off against Massachusetts for the Hockey East championship. Welsch continued his strong play but the Minutemen defense was stifling, allowed the Hawks only 16 shots on goal, none of which found the back of the net. UMass Lowell has to settle for second place but the team had redeemed itself for an otherwise disappointing campaign.\nBen McEvoy sat out the season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

He was one of the first big recruits for the program after it moved up to Division I in 1974–75. In each of his four years with the Catamounts Cote was better than a point-per game player and helped the Catamounts transition into becoming a viable team at the top level of college hockey. Cote was named as an All-American for his junior and senior season despite missing 10 games in his final campaign. He left Vermont as the programs all-time leader in scoring by a defenseman and continued to hold that position as of 2021.\nAfter graduation, Cote continued his playing career. He appeared briefly for the Carolina Thunderbirds in 1980 before heading to Japan. He played three years for Sapporo and then signed on with Chamonix HC, playing hockey on his third continent. He left France for a season to play with the Dundee Rockets but quickly returned and eventually joined the French National Team. He played in three separate World Championships but was unable to help France earn a promotion to the top tier. Cote retired in 1991, shortly after being inducted into the Vermont Athletic Hall of Fame."

With the support of Scottish Rugby, she took a sabbatical to focus on rugby in the run-up to the Tokyo Olympic Games: “I was struggling to balance my work and rugby – it was becoming too much – and Scottish Rugby luckily were happy to help me out and get me off work because I was starting to struggle training at a high level.\"\nSmith began playing rugby at the age of 17 at Stirling County – the same club as her brother Matt, a former Glasgow Warriors and Scotland U20 player."

        "text": "The discography of the American rock and emo band American Football consists of three studio albums, two extended plays (EP), four singles and eight music videos. Because all three albums are eponymous, they are known as LP1, LP2, and LP3. The band was formed in 1997 in Urbana, Illinois, by Mike Kinsella, Steve Lamos, and Steve Holmes while they were students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A year later, they released a self-titled EP, followed by their debut studio album, \"American Football\" (LP1), in 1999. Shortly after, the band graduated from college, and not expecting the album to receive any attention, broke up.\nLP1's music and enigmatic cover art, which shows a green tinted picture of a white house in Urbana (which later became known as the American Football House), developed a word-of-mouth cult following, and today is considered a central influence on the 2010s emo revival. In 2014, Polyvinyl Records re-released LP1 as a deluxe edition, which reached number 68 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Its success led to the band reforming for a series of live shows that year, for which they recruited Nate Kinsella, Mike Kinsella's nephew. In 2016, they released their second album, \"American Football\" (LP2), which reached number 82 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and number 3 on the Independent Albums chart. They followed up with \"American Football\" (LP3), and an extended play of early demos, \"Year One Demos\", in 2019. LP3 and \"Year One Demos\" reached numbers 4 and 44 respectively on the Independent Albums chart; although neither record reached the \"Billboard\" 200."

The race, known as the \"test of the champion\", is the final leg in the American Triple Crown, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The race was won by Essential Quality.\nThe race took place on June 5, 2021, in Elmont, New York, with an actual start time of 6:50 p.m. EDT; television coverage was by NBC. It was a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million. Entering the race, it was known that there would be no Triple Crown winner, as the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes had already been won by different horses.\nBackground.\nDue to effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 edition was contested as the \"first\" leg of the Triple Crown, on June 20 without spectators. The 2021 Triple Crown races returned to their traditional sequence and schedule, with Medina Spirit winning the 2021 Kentucky Derby on May 1, and Rombauer winning the 2021 Preakness Stakes on May 15. A week after the Derby, it was announced that Medina Spirit had tested positive for betamethasone, a corticosteroid, and stands to be disqualified if the split sample confirms the positive; with that result still pending, Medina Spirit submitted to additional testing and was allowed to run in the Preakness.\nAttendance for the Belmont was set at a maximum of 11,000 spectators, with attendees required to provide proof of their COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.\nField.\nSeveral horses that ran in the Derby and then bypassed the Preakness were possible entrants in the Belmont: Mandaloun, Hot Rod Charlie, Essential Quality, and O Besos.\nOn May 17, the New York Racing Association (NYRA) banned trainer Bob Baffert from entering any horses in races in the state of New York. The ban had not been lifted by June 5 and so prevented Medina Spirit or Concert Tour from running in the Belmont. The same day, Preakness winner Rombauer and seventh-place finisher France Go de Ina arrived at Belmont Park. On May 18, owners of Kentucky Oaks winner Malathaat stated that the filly would not be entered in the Belmont.\nWith a maximum field size of 16 horses, the post-position draw was held on June 1.

        "text": "The British Army Rugby League team is the official rugby league team representing the British Army. The team was founded in 1994 when the Army first recognised rugby league as an official sport and lifted a ban on it. The new team was able to play in the Challenge Cup. The team play their home matches at Aldershot Military Stadium in Aldershot, Hampshire. An Army women's team was set up in 2008.\nHistory.\nHistorically, rugby league had been banned in the British Armed Forces due to the strength of rugby union and the Rugby Football Union's demands that anyone playing rugby league would be banned from playing rugby union. During the Second World War, the Northern Command Sports Board (NCSB) held sympathy towards Northern soldiers who wished to play rugby league. They set up a number of matches between unofficial army representative teams and Northern clubs. This arrangement only lasted until the end of the war when the Army ended a relaxation on the ban and because the NCSB did not wish to try to challenge the primacy of the Army Rugby Union.\nThe ban was lifted in 1994 following an announcement by the Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley. The new team was founded by Martin Coyd of the Royal Engineers. Due to the wide array of British Army deployments worldwide, the British Army do not play in a league in the English rugby league system. Occasionally they have players from the Army Rugby Union cross codes to play in their matches.\nAs a result of the ban being lifted, the men's team became eligible to enter the Challenge Cup. Initially in 1999, the Rugby Football League (RFL) were only going to allow the winners of the Inter-Services competition (which the Army won) to enter in the 2000 Challenge Cup but they were eventually persuaded that all three of the services teams were able to enter. The team's best result was to reach the fourth round of the 2020 Challenge Cup, the highest for a forces team since 2010 when the Royal Navy reached the third round. However none of the military teams took part in the 2021 Challenge Cup because the RFL decided that only professional Rugby League teams would be allowed to compete because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2022, the British Army were drawn against the Royal Navy in the Challenge Cup for the first time in the competition since their inaugural appearances.\nWomen's team.\nThe Army women's team was established in 2008. In 2014, they were named the Army Sports Team of the Year award at the Army Sports Awards. They first entered the Women's Challenge Cup in 2014 where they lost 30–16 in the quarter-finals (second round) to Thatto Heath. They reached the semi-final of the competition in 2016. In 2017, they were finalists in the Challenge Shield, losing 26–24 to York City Knights. In 2019, they faced York again in the final, but overcame them 40–4 to win the Challenge Shield. In 2021, the women's team were members of the inaugural Super League South and reached the Grand Final.\nWheelchair team.\nThe wheelchair rugby league team was established in 2019 and compete in inter-services competitions against the RAF and the Navy. In October 2022, the team played Australia in a warm-up game for the 2021 World Cup. In January 2024, the team played against the Wales national team as part of the preparations for Wales' US tour.\nResults.\nWomen's league seasons.\nSource:"

        "text": "The Royal Navy Rugby League team is a British rugby league team representing the Royal Navy. They play their home matches at the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth, Hampshire. They were founded in 1997 following an increase in support of rugby league by members of the Royal Navy.\nHistory.\nHistorically, rugby league had been banned in the British Armed forces since 1895 due to rugby union's Rugby Football Union's ban on anyone who played rugby league from playing rugby union. The ban was temporarily relaxed during the First World War to allow players from both codes to play together. Sailors deployed at HMNB Devonport founded a rugby league team in 1917 and they toured the country during the remainder of the war, making three tours of rugby league's northern heartlands. Most of the players involved never returned to rugby union once the ban was reinstated after the war.\nDespite the temporary wartime relaxation, rugby league remained banned in the Royal Navy until 1994. When the ban was lifted, the British Army and Royal Air Force set up their own teams the same year. But the Royal Navy did not set up their own until 1997, which was made in response to a request by members of the Royal Navy who were fans of rugby league. Accordingly, this meant they were able to enter the Challenge Cup, which they did for the first time in the 2000 Challenge Cup after the Rugby Football League decided to allow all of the forces teams to enter. In 2010, they reached the third round of the Cup, the highest round reached by any Forces side until the British Army equaled it in 2020. The Royal Navy did not take part in the 2021 Challenge Cup due to the RFL deciding that only the professional teams would be allowed to compete due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.\nThe Royal Navy also take part in the Inter Services Tournament, which had historically been dominated by the Army and the RAF. The Royal Navy won their first title in 2004 and then repeated that success in 2008. They have hosted touring Naval representative sides from the Royal Australian Navy for a Remembrance Day series in 2018, with the Royal Navy whitewashing them 3-0 in a three game series.\nIn 2017, to celebrate the Royal Navy Rugby League's 20th anniversary, they hosted an Origin match between their East and West Barracks at Leeds Rhinos' Headingley Stadium with the aim of raising money for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Charity."

        "text": "The Royal Air Force Rugby League is a British rugby league team representing the Royal Air Force. They were officially set up in 1994 following an unofficial team set up in 1992 to circumvent a British Armed Forces ban on rugby league. They play in the Challenge Cup and they play their home matches at RAF Cranwell in Cranwell, Lincolnshire.\nHistory.\nHistorically, rugby league had been banned in the British Armed Forces due to rugby union's Rugby Football Union's law stating that anyone who played rugby league would be banned from playing rugby union. Northern based Royal Air Force personnel argued for its lifting in the 1980s but it remained in place. Despite this, some RAF personnel set up an unofficial rugby league team called the \"Blue Bombers\" without RAF authorisation in 1992. When the ban on the sport within the services was lifted in 1994, the RAF Rugby League Association was founded by Squadron Leader Damian Clayton, who would captain the team from its foundation to 2006. The RAF rugby league team was established at the same time as the British Army's rugby league association. They eventually gained official RAF sanction on 1st Jan 1996. The President of the RAF Rugby League, Air commodore Dean Andrew later became the President of the Rugby Football League. In 2020, their kit was supplied by O'Neills which led to some controversy in Ireland due to the kitmaker's history of making Gaelic Athletic Association kits solely.\nThe RAF play inter-services matches against the British Army and Royal Navy. They won their first title in 2001, ending the British Army's seven season winning streak which had run since the establishment of the Inter-Services Championship. Their 2015 Inter-Services Championship match against the British Army was held at Salford Red Devils' AJ Bell Stadium as part of an awareness campaign. In 2012 and 2016, the RAF won the Inter-Services Rugby League Title. In 2019, an RAF player died during a match against the Army at Aldershot Military Stadium following a head injury.\nThe RAF set up a women's rugby league team and some of the servicewomen who play for the RAF have been selected for international representative matches."

        "title": "2021–22 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2021–22 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by fifth-year head coach Patrick Ewing, were members of the Big East Conference. The Hoyas played their home games at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.\nDespite having won the 2021 Big East men's basketball tournament and a highly ranked 2021–2022 recruiting class, the Hoyas had a historically bad season. Winning their last game on December 15 and posting a 6–25 record overall, they went winless in Big East competition, finishing in last place in the regular season with a record of 0–19, and lost in the first round of the 2022 Big East men's basketball tournament. Georgetown's second-worst season by winning percentage, it set a school record for losses overall and a school and conference record for conference losses in a season, and it began a school-record losing streak that remained active at the end of the season. It was the first winless conference season in Georgetown history and the first last-place conference finish for the school in the combined history of the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 and the new Big East Conference founded in 2013. It was the only Georgetown team to finish in last place in conference play other than the 1934–1935 team, which finished in last place in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference.\nPrevious season.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hoyas played a reduced non-conference schedule and had four conference games canceled during the 2020–2021 season. They posted a final record of 13–13, 7–9 in Big East play, and finished in eighth place in the conference. In the Big East tournament, they defeated Marquette, Villanova, and Seton Hall to advance to the tournament championship game. In the championship, they defeated Creighton for the school's first tournament championship since 2007. As a result, the Hoyas received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2015. As the No. 12 seed in the East region, they lost in the first round to Colorado.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nNOTE: Chudier Bile, Jahvon Blair, and Jamorko Pickett all declared for the 2021 NBA draft after a four-year college career, opting not take advantage of the special fifth year of eligibility the NCAA granted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIncoming transfers.\nNOTES: Tre King was dismissed from the university before the season began. Wayne Bristol transferred to Georgetown in midseason, and Georgetown announced his addition to the roster on January 27.\nRoster.\nNotes: Chuma Azinge was a recruited walk-on. Wayne Bristol transferred to Georgetown in midseason, and Georgetown announced his addition to the roster on January 27.\nSeason recap.\nSince Georgetown's run to the 2021 Big East tournament championship and appearance in the 2021 NCAA tournament, the team had lost seven players. Graduate transfer point guard Jalen Harris, who played only five games with the Hoyas in 2020–2021 before taking a leave of absence for \"family reasons\", never returned to Georgetown. Senior guard Jahvon Blair, the team's leading scorer, and four-year starting guard/forward Jamorko Pickett had both graduated and graduate student Chudier Bile, a forward who after a slow start had played a large role in Georgetown's late-season resurgence in 2020–2021, also had departed, all three foregoing their COVID-19 pandemic-related fifth year of collegiate eligibility to enter the 2020 NBA draft. On April 14, 2021, moreover, the NCAA had approved a new transfer rule allowing Division I players to transfer once during their college careers and begin play immediately for their new schools, repealing a rule instituted in the 1960s requiring a transferring player to sit out two semesters before resuming play, and this removed a major disincentive to transferring. Sophomore starting center Qudus Wahab, who Ewing had said could be Georgetown's next dominating \"big man\", had surprised sports pundits and fans by transferring to Maryland. Two freshman who had seen only limited action — forward Jamari Sibley, who had been Georgetown's only four-star recruit for 2020–2021, and guard T.J. Berger — had transferred in search of greater playing time, Sibley leaving for UTEP and Berger departing for San Diego. However, Georgetown's loss of three players to transfer was merely the average among Division I schools during the 2021 offseason, which had seen 1,068 men's basketball players change schools at the dawn of the new transfer era. Three-year recruited walk-on Jaden Robinson, who had not appeared in a game during the 2020–2021 season, also left the program, opting not to return for a fourth year with the team.\nOnly six scholarship players returned from the 2020–2021 team. They included senior guard Donald Carey, Georgetown's top three-point shooter in 2020–2021; sophomore starting point guard Dante Harris, the 2021 Big East tournament Most Outstanding Player; junior centers Timothy Ighoefe — the presumptive starter after Wahab's departure — and Malcolm Wilson; and sophomore forwards Kobe Clark and Collin Holloway. Two walk-ons, junior guard Chuma Azinge and sophomore forward Victor Muresan, the son of National Basketball Association great Gheorghe Muresan, also returned. Two transfers arrived at Georgetown, senior Tre King from Eastern Kentucky and graduate student Kaiden Rice from The Citadel; the program hoped that King, a projected starter, could fill a gap at power forward as well as pose a three-point shooting threat, while Rice also was a skilled three-point shooter with the potential to make the starting lineup. Also joining the team were five freshmen who made up what 247Sports.com ranked as the 16th-best recruiting class in the United States and third in the Big East. It included guard Aminu Mohammed (the first five-star recruit of Ewing's tenure as head coach), four-star center Ryan Mutombo (the son of Georgetown and NBA great Dikembe Mutombo), combo guard Tyler Beard (who a year earlier had opted to delay his enrollment at Georgetown to spend an additional year at Hargrave Military Academy), power forward Jalin Billingsley, and shooting guard Jordan Riley. Mohammed was voted the preseason Big East Freshman of the Year for 2021–2022, the first Georgetown player so honored in Ewing's tenure as head coach.\nConfusion over Georgetown's 2021–2022 schedule arose early in the offseason. On April 15, 2021, media reports indicated that Georgetown would play in the Orlando Invitational at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Kissimmee, Florida, on November 25, 26 and 28. On April 23, however, media reports indicated that the Hoyas would replace TCU in the 2021 Wooden Legacy in Anaheim, California, on November 25–26. The situation finally was clarified on May 20, when Georgetown confirmed it would play in the Wooden Legacy, explaining that reports of its participation in the Orlando Invitational had been unofficial and that the school had never confirmed its participation.\nWhen the matchups for the Gavitt Tipoff Games against Big Ten Conference opponents were announced on June 24, Georgetown was among the three Big East teams not selected to participate. It marked the first time since 2017 that the Hoyas did not play in the annual competition between the two conferences.\nTo increase attendance in the lower bowl of Capital One Arena — an oversized venue for most college basketball games — and overcome the television optics of many empty seats down close to the court, Georgetown introduced a new ticket strategy for 2021–2022. It made tickets for each of six lower-profile non-conference home games (against Dartmouth, American, Siena, Longwood, UMBC, and Howard) free for season-ticket holders, but required them to actively opt in to attending each of the games; if they did not opt in to a given game, Georgetown reallocated their tickets to others who wanted to attend. Georgetown also allowed season-ticket holders who did opt in to those games to request an additional four free tickets. In addition, the school redistributed seats to help fill the lower bowl for the games, allowing some season-ticket holders and their guests to sit closer to the court than they otherwise would have. Georgetown also made all tickets to the opening game against Dartmouth free to anyone who requested one, both to boost early-season attendance and celebrate the return of fans to home games after their absence during the 2020–2021 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeorgetown released its 2020–2021 roster later than usual, leading to speculation that roster turmoil might already have struck the team. When the roster was released on October 15, Tre King was missing from it. The school released a statement that day explaining that King \"did not meet the conduct expectations of the University. He is not enrolled in classes and will not be on the Men's Basketball team.\" King was dismissed from the university on October 16. He re-entered the transfer portal on October 22, and his transfer to Iowa State was announced on December 1.\nIn their annual preseason poll in October, the Big East's coaches picked the Hoyas to finish in 10th place in the 11-team conference, a slight improvement over their 11th-place selection a year earlier. The loss of Tre King was a blow, and the 2021–2022 squad was a young team, rebuilding from its offseason roster turnover and facing possible frontcourt weaknesses. Sports pundits did not have high hopes for Georgetown to return to the NCAA tournament in 2022 and expected the Hoyas to finish in the bottom half of the Big East. However, if the Hoyas made a successful non-conference showing and demonstrated an ability to stand up to powerhouse teams in the Big East, a National Invitation Tournament bid in 2022 seemed a reasonable possibility as the 2021–2022 season began.\nDuring the 2020-2021 season, the Big East Conference had postponed and attempted to reschedule any conference game that a team could not play due to COVID-19 pandemic issues. In the fall of 2021, the Big East Conference announced a new policy for the 2021–2022 season requiring any team which could not play a conference game on its originally scheduled date due to an insufficient number of available players, \"including\" as a result of COVID-19 exposure or infections, to forfeit the game, with a loss assigned to that team and a win assigned to its scheduled opponent, the win and loss also applying to the conference standings. The policy was intended to incentivize all Big East teams to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 so as to avoid forfeiting games.\nNon-conference season.\nWith all tickets free to anyone who requested one, the Hoyas drew 8,641 fans — including former Georgetown and NBA great Dikembe Mutombo, who saw his son Ryan make his collegiate debut — to their opener against Dartmouth on November 13, the first game of a three-game homestand at Capital One Arena. Kobe Clark, Collin Holloway, and Timothy Ighoefe all sat out the game with injuries — Ighoefe due to a possible concussion he had suffered in practice — and center Malcolm Wilson made the first start of his college career and only his 13th appearance in a college game. Dartmouth guard Brendan Barry had a connection to Georgetown — his grandfather Jim Barry had been a standout forward on the Hoya teams of 1962–1963, 1964–1965, and 1965–1966 — but it was only the third meeting of the teams, the first since December 1974, and the first in Washington. Dartmouth had not had a winning season since 1998–1999 or an NCAA Tournament bid since 1959, had not fielded a team during the 2020–2021 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was expected to finish near the bottom of the Ivy League in 2021–2022, and had lost its season opener by 16 points to a Boston College team expected to finish near the bottom of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and Georgetown was a -point favorite. However, Dartmouth found great success in penetrating the Hoya defense and then passing the ball out for open three-point shots, and made 16 of 38 three-pointers (42 percent) during the game. The Big Green went on an 18–2 run in the first half to take a 28–10 lead, and although the Hoyas scored seven straight points late in the first half, the Big Green led 37–21 at halftime. The Hoyas started the second half with a 14–0 run to close to 37–35, but Dartmouth then went on an 11-5 run of its own to pull out to a 48–40 lead. The Hoyas mounted another comeback, scoring the next 10 points, and took their only lead of the game at 50–48 with 10:56 left to play, but they held it for only 16 seconds as Dartmouth responded with a decisive 18–3 run and won 69–60 in a shocking upset. Georgetown's all-time record against Dartmouth fell to 1–2. Aminu Mohammed led the Hoyas with 17 points and Donald Carey scored 14.\nThree days later, Georgetown had a much better game against American — a team which had played only 10 games in 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic — and broke open a four-point game in the second half with a 24–2 run on the way to a 79–57 victory, the Hoyas' 11th straight win over the Eagles. Aminu Mohammed had a double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds, Dante Harris scored 13, Donald Carey added 12, and Timothy Ighoefe returned to action, scoring six points and grabbing 11 rebounds. The Hoyas improved their record to 2–1 on November 19 with an 18-point victory over winless Siena — a team which entering the game ranked 339th in Division I in scoring offense and tied for 320th in scoring defense — in which Kaiden Rice snapped out of his season-opening slump, shooting 7-for-10 from three-point range and scoring 23 points, while Carey added 20, Harris scored 14, and Mohammed finished with 11.\nGeorgetown had planned to play in the 2020 Wooden Legacy tournament the previous season, but it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the Hoyas played in the 2021 edition of the Wooden Legacy, going on the road for the first time in the 2021–2022 season to play in the tournament at Anaheim Arena in Anaheim, California. An eight-team tournament from 2013 through 2019, the Wooden Legacy debuted a new four-team format in 2021, and Georgetown faced San Diego State in the semifinals on Thanksgiving night. The Hoyas had met the Aztecs only once before, in December 1981. Entering the game, the Aztecs were ranked only 342nd in Division I in three-point shooting at 24.6 percent while Georgetown was ranked 21st, making 41.5 percent of its three-pointers. During the game, however, San Diego State shot 7-of-16 from beyond the arc (43.8 percent) while Georgetown made only four out of 20 (20 percent) three-point shots. The Aztecs dunked five times on the Hoyas and built a 54–39 lead before the Hoyas closed to four points behind at 57–53 with minutes left to play, but from there San Diego State outscored Georgetown 16–3 and won 73–56. Missing their last 10 shots, the Hoyas shot only 35.1 percent for the game and had only six assists. Aminu Mohammed and Dante Harris between them scored Georgetown's first 19 points and were the only Hoyas to finish in double figures, Mohammed with 20 points and Harris with 19. Donald Carey, Georgetown's leading scorer entering the game at 15.3 points per game, managed only four points, all on free throws, while Kaiden Rice shot 2-for-7 (28.5 percent) from three-point range and finished with eight points. It was the Aztecs' sixth straight win against the Big East, the longest active streak in the United States, and it evened the all-time record between the schools at 1–1.\nThe next day, San Diego State met USC in the tournament championship, while Georgetown was a -point favorite against Saint Joseph's, a 2–3 team, in the third-place game. Although the Hoyas and Hawks had played annually from the 1961–1962 through 1979–1980 seasons, it was the first meeting of the teams since then. Saint Joseph's led 15–14 with 11 minutes left in the first half, but after the Hoyas scored to take a 16–15 lead, the Hawks went on a 12-0 run and pulled ahead 27–16. Although Georgetown switched to an aggressive and effective full-court press and cut the lead to eight, the Hoyas shot only 30 percent from the field in the first half and at halftime Saint Joseph's led 36–26. After halftime, a 7–0 Hoya run helped Georgetown close the gap, and the Hoyas eventually took a 54–53 lead. Saint Joseph's responded with a 7–0 run of its own, and Georgetown again came back to close to 66–64. In the final seconds, Donald Carey lost the ball on a bad pass attempt with the Hawks leading 74–72, and Collin Holloway's last-second three-point attempt was blocked from behind, giving Saint Joseph's a 77–74 win. Saint Joseph's senior forward Taylor Funk had an outstanding performance, scoring a game-high 29 points on 9-for-11 (82 percent) shooting, including 8-for-10 from three-point range, and grabbing seven rebounds. Kaiden Rice led the Hoyas with 25 points, while Dante Harris scored 17, Donald Carey finished with 12, and Timothy Ighoefe grabbed 14 rebounds and added four points. The Hawks' victory tied the all-time series between the schools at 17–17 and dropped the Hoyas to 2–3 on the season. They returned to Washington ranked 230th in Division I in perimeter defense, allowing opponents to shoot 34.3 percent from three-point range.\nGeorgetown next met Longwood before a sparse crowd at Capital One Arena. Longwood had never beaten a major-conference team but scored the first nine points of the game on three three-pointers and shot 40 percent from beyond the arc during the first half. The Hoyas did not take their first lead until pulling ahead 28–27 with 3:56 left in the first half, then pulled away with a 12–4 run to end the half. Although Georgetown led for the rest of the game, the Lancers, who shot 37.5 percent from three-point range for the game, twice cut the deficit to one point. Georgetown still led by only three points with under three minutes to play, but then pulled ahead 81–75, and Longwood never got closer than four points the rest of the way. The Hoyas evened their record at 3–3 with a 91–83 victory. Sophomore Collin Holloway, who scored a total of 15 points during his freshman year, came off the bench to lead the Hoyas with a career-high 23 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the field, while Aminu Mohammed had a double-double (15 points and 11 rebounds), Kaiden Rice finished with 15 points on five three-pointers, Dante Harris added 14 points, seven rebounds, and five assists, and Donald Carey scored 12 points. Timothy Ighoefe left the game in the first half with what turned out to be a broken hand; he did not return to the game and had surgery on December 2, and on December 3 Ewing announced that he would be out of action for four to six weeks.\nGeorgetown went back on the road to meet South Carolina on December 5 in the first year of a two-year home-and-home series against the Gamecocks. Tracy McGrady, who had played and coached with Ewing in the NBA, South Carolina and NBA great Alex English, and Dikembe Mutombo all attended the game. Both teams shot poorly from the field at first — the Hoyas missed their first nine shots and 20 of their first 23, while South Carolina went 6-for-22 to start the game — but the Gamecocks mounted a balanced offense and the Hoyas trailed for the entire game, shooting only 9-for-41 (22 percent) from the field in the first half, and falling behind 21–9. Georgetown used a 14–4 run to close to 25–23, but South Carolina finished the half with an 11–4 spurt of its own, and Georgetown went into the locker room at halftime behind 36–27. The Hoyas spent most of the second half trailing by about eight points, fell as many as 15 points behind, and never got closer than six points, and South Carolina used a late 13–4 run to clinch an 80–67 victory. Donald Carey — who connected on four of eight three-point attempts, the only Hoya to make more than one three-pointer — scored 20 points, Aminu Mohammed 17, and Dante Harris 13, but Kaiden Rice missed all ten shots he took during the game, eight of them from three-point range. Georgetown dropped below .500 for the season again and headed back to Washington to close out non-conference play with a four-game homestand at Capital One Arena.\nThe homestand began with a blowout win over UMBC in which Georgetown scored 100 points for the first time since December 2018 — and fourth time in Ewing's tenure as head coach — and improved its all-time record against the Retrievers to 5–0. Kaiden Rice bounced back from his ineffective outing against South Carolina three days earlier with an historic game, leading the Hoyas with a career-high 34 points — the first Hoya to score 30 or more points in a game since Mac McClung in December 2018 — on 11-for-14 shooting from the field, and his 10 three-pointers (on 12 attempts) — including four in less than five minutes in the second half — broke the previous school record of seven in a single game, set by Mark Tillmon in 1990 and matched several times since. With his father Dikembe again looking on, Ryan Mutombo had his first collegiate double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds, both career highs, while Aminu Mohammed finished with the third double-double (13 points and 10 rebounds) of his collegiate career. Dante Harris added 13 points.\nIn front of its largest crowd of the season by far — including former Georgetown and NBA greats Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo Mourning and former Syracuse standout and NBA player Rony Seikaly — Georgetown next faced Syracuse on December 11, the 97th meeting of the schools in a series that dated to 1930. It was the annual renewal of the archrivalry between the schools during their membership in the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013, when John Thompson coached Georgetown and Jim Boeheim coached Syracuse. Thompson had died in 2020, and before the first game of the 2020–21 season, Georgetown had named its home court \"John Thompson Jr. Court\" in his honor in a ceremony at McDonough Gymnasium, where Georgetown played all of its home games that season with no fans in the stands because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The school planned to dedicate the home court's name at Capital One Arena in front of fans when public health restrictions allowed a resumption of games there and with fans in attendance. Play resumed at Capital One Arena and fans returned to games at the beginning of the 2021-2022 season, but — although the name \"John Thompson Jr. Court\" appeared on the court at Capital One Arena from the first game of the season — Georgetown waited until a ceremony before the Syracuse game to dedicate the court, with Boeheim — in his 46th season as Syracuse's head coach — looking on with a smile.\nGeorgetown took the lead five minutes into the game on three straight Kaiden Rice three-pointers, but Syracuse responded with a 9–0 run and the Orange retook the lead in the middle of the first half. Georgetown had trouble scoring against Syracuse's strong zone defense in the first half, shooting only 37 percent from the field to Syracuse's 56 percent, and at halftime trailed 44–34. Ewing went with a smaller, quicker lineup during the second half to overcome the Orange's zone defense, using a rotation of guards and forwards rather than relying on a post player handling the ball in the middle of the zone, resulting in the Hoyas shooting 56 percent from the field after halftime. Georgetown opened the second half with a 21–9 run, giving the Hoyas their first lead since the middle of the first half at 55–53 with minutes remaining in the game. All five Syracuse starters averaged in double figures on the season and scored in double figures during the game, but Georgetown's defense clamped down in the second half. Although the Orange's third-leading scorer and top three-point shooter, junior guard Joseph Girard III, went 4-for-6 from the field in the first half, he did not score again until 10 seconds remained in the game thanks to Dante Harris's defense — and to that of Tyler Beard, who filled in for Harris when Harris departed the game for four minutes in the second half after hurting his ankle in a hard fall. During the second half, Syracuse shot only 36.1 percent from the field and 3-for-14 (21.4 percent) from three-point range. The Hoyas made their last six free throws, and Georgetown took the lead for good at 75–73 with 1:11 left to play on a Kaiden Rice three-pointer — his first three-pointer after seven straight misses. Georgetown committed 11 turnovers, seven of them in the second half, and Syracuse outscored the Hoyas 42–26 in the paint, but Georgetown attempted 10 more free throws than the Orange and outrebounded Syracuse 38–31, and Georgetown won 79–75. Aminu Mohammed shot 7-for-14 from the field and sank eight out of nine free throws, scored 20 points in the second half, and finished with a double-double (a game-high and career-high 23 points and a game-high and career-high 13 rebounds) along with two blocked shots, two steals, and a personal-best five assists; his two free throws with nine seconds left clinched the win. Donald Carey added 18 points on 4-for-7 shooting from beyond the arc and 6-for-6 from the free-throw line, while Kaiden Rice made five of his 15 three-point attempts to finish with 15 points. Off the bench, Collin Holloway scored 10 points, eight of them in the second half.\nWith Timothy Ighoefe still out of action, Jordan Riley out indefinitely with a shoulder injury suffered during the UMBC game that required surgery, and Jalin Billingsley and second-leading scorer Kaiden Rice (at 14.5 points per game on 43.3 percent three-point shooting) sidelined by a non-COVID-19-related illness, the Hoyas — with only seven scholarship players available — were shorthanded four days later when they hosted a Howard team that was much improved from its previous two seasons. Bison fifth-year senior guard Kyle Foster scored a career-high 26 points during the game and Howard led 31–22 in the first half before the Hoyas took the lead for good with a 24–6 run before halftime. Both Aminu Mohammed and Collin Holloway fouled out in the game's final minutes, leaving Georgetown with only five scholarship players available, so walk-on Chuma Azinge stepped in and logged a career-high nine minutes. Howard got as close as 56–52 in the second half, but an 18–4 Hoya run followed that sealed the victory for Georgetown. Georgetown's defense forced a season-high 21 turnovers. It was the Hoyas' sixth straight home victory, and it improved Georgetown's all-time record against the Bison to 11–0 in a series that dated back to 1999. Tyler Beard, who had scored a total of 14 points in the previous nine games of his collegiate career, came off the bench for a career-high 23 points. Holloway scored 15 in his first collegiate start and Malcolm Wilson finished with a 13 points and eight rebounds — both career highs — and blocked four shots. Two other Hoyas also scored in double figures, with Donald Carey adding 14 points and Dante Harris 10. The victory gave Georgetown a 49—0 record all-time against the eight programs that made up the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference at the time and it extended the Hoyas' winning streak to three, the longest regular-season winning streak for Georgetown since December 2019. However, it also was Georgetown′s last victory of the season.\nWhat turned out to be a school-record losing streak began when Georgetown finished its non-conference schedule by hosting TCU on December 18 in the final game of the annual Big East–Big 12 Battle. It was the first meeting of the schools, and the first game TCU ever played in Washington, D.C. Jalin Billingsley and Kaiden Rice returned to action, but Dante Harris was sidelined, having sprained his ankle in the Syracuse game and aggravated the injury during practice on December 17, leaving Tyler Beard to fill in for him at point guard. TCU jumped out to an early 10–4 lead, but Georgetown closed the gap and took the lead at 13–12 with 11 minutes left in the first half. TCU later jumped out to a 30–23 lead — the largest lead either team had in the first half — before the Hoyas scored nine straight points to pull ahead 32–30, and from there the two teams were unable to achieve much separation from one another; although TCU led for 26 minutes overall during the game — never by double digits — and Georgetown trailed 39–36 at halftime, there were 13 ties and 16 lead changes during the game. The second half was back-and-forth and Georgetown led 61–59 midway through the half, but then TCU went on a decisive 14–3 run that ended with 4:14 left to play put the Horned Frogs ahead 73–64, their largest lead of the game; although the Hoyas closed to 76–73, TCU scored the final four points to win 80–73, the Horned Frogs′ sixth straight victory. Aminu Mohammed had a double-double (game highs of 21 points and 11 rebounds), Kaiden Rice went 4-for-11 in three-pointers and scored 14 points, and Donald Carey added 12. Georgetown's persistent weakness over several years in three-point defense — the Hoyas were ranked 10th in the 11-team Big East in defending against three-pointers — was on display, allowing the Horned Frogs to sink a season-high 11 three-pointers; shooting 27.9 percent from beyond the arc entering the game, TCU sank 42 percent of its three-point shots against the Hoyas. Georgetown wrapped up the non-conference portion of its schedule with a record of 6–5.\nConference season.\nCOVID-19 pause.\nThe previous season, with Connecticut joining the Big East, plans had called for Georgetown to play its first-ever 20-game Big East Conference schedule, with a home-and-home series against each of the other ten Big East teams, but cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic had reduced the Hoyas' conference schedule to 16 games. Plans again called for a 20-game conference schedule in 2021–2022, but COVID-19 again interfered. Under the new Big East Conference policy for the season, any team unable to field enough players for a game, including for COVID-19 reasons, was required to forfeit the game, and when COVID-19 problems arose on the Georgetown team after the conclusion of the non-conference schedule, the Hoyas were forced to forfeit their December 22 conference season opener at No. 22 Providence. The forfeit temporarily dropped Georgetown's overall record to 6–6 and conference record to 0–1.\nOn December 23, however, after four Big East games had been cancelled due to COVID-19 and with cases of the disease spiking across the United States, the Big East rescinded the policy requiring forfeits. It announced a new policy, under which a team would be required to play a scheduled game if it could field seven scholarship players and one \"countable\" coaching staff member for the game, but that no team would be required to forfeit a game it could not play for COVID-19 reasons. Instead, any such game would be rescheduled if possible or declared a \"no contest\" if rescheduling proved impossible. The new policy erased Georgetown's forfeit to Providence and returned the team's record to 6–5 overall and 0–0 in the Big East. It also came just in time for the Hoyas to avoid forfeiting a second game, because on December 24 Georgetown announced that its game against Creighton scheduled for December 28 also was cancelled because of COVID-19 issues on the team. With continuing covid-19 problems on both the Georgetown and St. John's teams, the Big East announced on December 27 that Georgetown's first two conference home games, against St. John's on January 1 and No. 22 Xavier on January 4, also were cancelled. On January 1, Georgetown announced that its game at Providence had been rescheduled for January 20, and that the postponed game at Creighton would be played on February 14. On January 4, the Big East announced that the game against St. John's had been moved from Capital One Arena to McDonough Gymnasium and rescheduled for February 21, then on January 5 announced that the rescheduled game had been moved to February 3. The Xavier game never was rescheduled, limiting the Hoyas to a 19-game conference season. Meanwhile, the Hoyas paused basketball activities until January 4, when they resumed practices.\nJanuary.\nThe Hoyas finally opened their conference season — the last Big East team to do so — by hosting Marquette at Capital One Arena on January 7. Donald Carey sat out the game with an undisclosed illness, so Collin Holloway started in his place, Holloway′s second collegiate start Kobe Clark returned to action for the first time since a hamstring injury sidelined him on November 25, but Ryan Mutombo did not play. Georgetown's defense was unable to stop the Golden Eagles either in the paint or from the perimeter, and Marquette shot 60 percent from the field. Marquette took advantage of Georgetown′s 15 turnovers to score 29 points in transition, outshot the Hoyas 56–28 in the paint, and shot 34.6 percent from three-point range. The Hoyas trailed by only a point in the first half when the Golden Eagles began a surge of just under five minutes in which they pulled ahead by 18 points, and although Georgetown clawed back to a three-point deficit in the second half, another huge Marquette run put the Golden Eagles ahead by 32 points. Collin Holloway led the team with 17 points, Dante Harris added 15, and Aminu Mohammed finished with 12, but the Hoyas shot only 4-of-18 from three-point range and only 30 percent from the field overall, and Marquette won 92–64, a season-high score for a Georgetown opponent. A furious Patrick Ewing abruptly left a postgame press conference after telling reporters that he was disappointed in the team's performance, saying \"We did not compete\", adding that \"Big John [former Georgetown head coach John Thompson, Jr.] is rolling over in his grave for the performance that we showed tonight\" and concluding with \"everybody is on notice. If they want to play, they're going to have to frigging play.\"\nDuring a six-day layoff before the Hoyas hosted Butler, Georgetown announced on January 12 that Ewing would sit out the game against the Bulldogs at Capital One Arena on January 13 in accordance with District of Columbia public health guidelines, and that assistant coach Louis Orr would guide the team that night. Timothy Ighoefe returned to action for the Butler game, playing for the first time since breaking his hand against Longwood on November 30, but Donald Cary, Dante Harris, and Kobe Clark all missed the game due to illness, and Georgetown's only remaining point guard, Tyler Beard, started in place of Harris. Missing an average 17 points per game from their sidelined players, the shorthanded Hoyas fell behind 14–10 to start the game, then used a 10–3 run to take a 20–17 lead halfway through the first half. An 11–2 Butler run to close the first half allowed the Bulldogs to tie the game at 27–27 with 2:55 left in the half and take a 32–27 halftime lead, and Butler scored the first eight points of the second half, capping off a 13–0 run to pull ahead 40–27. Butler later increased its lead to 53–33, and although Georgetown closed to a 10-point deficit with 1:43 remaining, the Hoyas got no closer, and the Bulldogs cruised to a 72–58 victory. Beard led the team with 15 points, Collin Holloway finished with 11, and Ighoefe scored four points and grabbed nine rebounds in 16 minutes of play, but the Hoyas shot only 38.5 percent from the field in the first half and 30.3 percent after halftime and showed weaknesses in turnovers, in scoring on layups, and especially on defense. Aminu Mohammed finished with only seven points on 2–for 16 shooting, while Kaiden Rice hit only one three-pointer on eight attempts and scored only five points. Georgetown dropped to 0–2 in conference play and at 6–7 became the only Big East Team with an overall losing record. Three days later, with Dante Harris returning to action and scoring 13 points but Donald Carey, Kobe Clark, and Ewing still sidelined and Orr again coaching the team, the Hoyas' losing streak grew to four games in a loss to St. John's at Madison Square Garden. Aminu Mohammed had a double-double (13 points and 12 rebounds) despite attempting only seven field goals, and Kaiden Rice scored 19 points, but the Hoyas committed 21 turnovers, off which the Red Storm scored 29 points. Georgetown's defense remained porous, allowing St. John's to break open a 15–15 tie with an 11-0 run in the first half. The Hoyas closed to a six-point deficit, but trailed by 11 at halftime and fell behind by 20 points in the second half. Although the Hoyas used a 15–3 run to close the gap to eight points, they never got closer than seven points after halftime. Georgetown opened its conference season with three straight losses for the first time since the 2016–17 season with two straight games against ranked teams looming next on their schedule.\nThe Hoyas next visited No. 21 Providence — their first Top-25 opponent of the season — in a game rescheduled from December 22. It was Providence′s first game in 12 days due to COVID-19-related cancellations. The Hoyas started slow, missing their first 11 shots and committing five turnovers in the first seven minutes, and the Friars opened a 13–0 lead before Georgetown scored. Georgetown used an 18–2 run to close the gap and trailed by only three points, 37–34, at halftime. Providence opened the second half with an 11–2 run to take a 12-point lead, and Georgetown fell behind by 16 points halfway through the second half before closing to a 64–60 deficit with five minutes remaining. The Hoyas got no closer, and the Friars held on to win 83–75, giving Georgetown its first 0–4 conference start since 2016–2017. Returning from a week-and-a-half of inactivity due to COVID-19 protocols, Donald Carey scored 21 points and Kaiden Rice added 19 off the bench while Aminu Mohammed finished with 12. Entering the game with a Big East-worst 26.7 percent team three-point shooting average, the Hoyas went 13-for-23 (56.5 percent) from beyond the arc. However, their defense — worst in the conference, giving up 79.1 points per game entering the game — had another bad showing: The Friars had little trouble against Georgetown′s man-to-man defense, and Providence scored 30 points in the paint, shooting 51.7 percent overall from the field and 50 percent (5 for 10) from three-point range.\nGeorgetown returned home to meet another ranked opponent, No. 11 Villanova. The Wildcats pulled out to a nine-point lead before Georgetown used a full-court press to force several Villanova turnovers. Team captain Donald Carey scored the 1,000th point of his collegiate career with 2:47 remaining in the first half, and the Hoyas led 40–37 at halftime and extended their lead to 47–39 with 16:47 left to play in the game, but the Wildcats then scored nine straight points to take the lead. Georgetown led for the last time at 56–55 with 10:43 remaining. Villanova pulled away after that and won 85–74. The Wildcats shot 53.6 percent from the field and went 16-for-16 from the free-throw line, and Villanova guard Collin Gillespie scored a game-high 28 points, only two points short of his career high, set against Georgetown on February 3, 2019. It was Villanova's fifth win over Georgetown in six meetings and 17th in the last 20 games between the schools. The result evened the all-time series between the schools at 48–48, the first all-time series tie since it was 7–7 in 1981 and a marked turnaround since Georgetown held a 42–28 series edge — the greatest series lead by either school — in 2012. Villanova head coach Jay Wright improved his all-time record against Georgetown to 23-13, while Ewing's coaching record against Villanova fell to 2–8 and all-time record as Georgetown′s head coach to 68–69. Collin Holloway led the Hoyas with a career-high 25 points, Dante Harris added 17, and Aminu Mohammed finished with 13 and Carey with 11. Georgetown opened its Big East season with five straight losses for the first time in school history, with four of the conference losses by double-digit margins. In \"The Washington Post\" that evening, columnist Candace Bucker wrote that the 2022–2023 Hoyas had made \"the worst kind of program history,\" that the program's circumstances had \"never been this dire,\" and that for the first time in many observers' memory, the Washington, D.C., area was witnessing \"an irrelevant Georgetown hoops program.\" creating \"a hole in the region's fabric of basketball.\"\nThree days later, with ESPN questioning whether Ewing's head-coaching tenure could survive the 0–5 conference start, the Hoyas were on the road to play their third straight ranked opponent, visiting No. 20 Connecticut. UConn never trailed in the game, even though Georgetown hit seven of its first 10 three-pointers and went 8-first-12 from beyond the arc in the first half, closing to 36–31. However, the Huskies shot 56 from the field during the half, held a 52–40 lead at halftime, and then opened the second half with a 5–0 run to lead 57–40. Connecticut′s lead reached 20 points at 72–52, and the Huskies extended their lead from there, winning in a rout, 96–73. It was UConn's second-largest margin of victory against the Hoyas, exceeded only by a 94–70 win over Georgetown in January 2004. The Huskies outscored the Hoyas on fast breaks 27–6 and outrebounded Georgetown 40–28. Aminu Mohammed led the Hoyas with 15 points, Collin Holloway had 11, and Donald Carey finished with 10. Jalin Billingsley left the game late in the first half with a knee injury and did not return. A loss in a rematch with Butler in Indianapolis four days later closed out Georgetown′s first winless January since 1910. In a losing effort against the Bulldogs, Aminu Mohammed scored a game-high 16 points and Donald Carey added 12. After the game, KenPom ranked Georgetown's defense the worst in Big East history since KenPom's ratings began in 2002.\nOn January 27, Georgetown announced that junior guard/wing Wayne Bristol, Jr., had transferred from Howard to Georgetown amid hopes that he was eligible to begin play with Georgetown without delay, although \"administrative issues\" with the NCAA about his eligibility cropped up almost immediately. Although his eligibility for the spring semester eventually was resolved, e did not appear in a game during the 2021–2022 season.\nFebruary–March.\nGeorgetown opened February with a three-game homestand, which began with losses to Seton Hall and St. John's, the latter game rescheduled from January 1. To kick off Black History Month, Georgetown wore the colors of the Washington Bears and Seton Hall the colors of the Owl Field Club of Newark, New Jersey, a tribute to pre-National Basketball Association professional African American basketball teams. With Capital One Arena booked for a Kacey Musgraves concert, the St. John's game took place at McDonough Gymnasium with a crowd limited to 1,100 Georgetown student season-ticket holders due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restructions, Georgetown's first Big East game at McDonough with fans in attendance since 1984. Donald Carey led the Hoyas in both games, with 15 points against Seton Hall and a career-high 23 against St. John′s, while Aminu Mohammed had 14 points against the Pirates, Kaiden Rice came off the bench in both games and finished with 12 against Seton Hall and 20 in the St. John's game, and Dante Harris scored 12 against Seton Hall and just missed a double-double against St. John's with 10 points and nine rebounds.\nThe Hoyas finished the homestand by hosting Providence, which had risen to No. 15 in the AP poll and entered the game on a six-game winning streak. It was the 1,500th broadcast — well over half the 2,803 Georgetown games ever played — for longtime Georgetown radio voice Rich Chvotkin, who had broadcast every Georgetown game since the 1974–1975 season except for missing most of the 1990–1991 season while on United States Army Reserve duty during the Gulf War. The Hoyas forced Providence — which entered the game averaging 11.8 turnovers per game — into 10 turnovers in the first half and led at halftime 30–27 despite committing nine turnovers of their own. It was only the second halftime lead of the season against a Big East opponent for Georgetown, but the tide turned after halftime. Georgetown scored only two field goals in the first 12:26 of the second half, allowing Providence to take the lead and pull away. Friars junior guard Jared Bynum scored only five points in the first half, but in the second half had a personal 13–0 run and outscored the entire Georgetown team 27–22 to finish with a career-high 32 points. Aminu Mohammed led the Hoyas with 18 points, and Donald Carey scored 11, but the Friars won 71–52 in Providence's 12th victory in 15 games against Georgetown since 2015, completing the Friars′ sixth regular-season sweep of the Hoyas in eight seasons. The loss also extended the Hoyas′ losing streak to a school-record 11 games, exceeding the 10-game skid that extended across the last nine games of the 2003–2004 season and the opening game of the 2004–2005 season. At 6–15, the Hoyas also fell to nine games below .500 for the first time since the 1971–1972 season, when they had posted a 3–23 record.\nThe losing streak reached 12 games in a visit to DePaul in which Blue Demons sophomore forward David Jones had the first triple double in DePaul history (22 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists). The Hoyas led 31–30 at halftime, but the Blue Demons broke a second-half tie to put the game away with a 26–0 run as part of stretch in which they outscored the Hoyas 33–2. A scheduling anomaly followed in which Georgetown played back-to-back games against Creighton, caused by the rescheduling of the December 28 game at Creighton to February 14. In the first game, at Capital One Arena on February 12, two Bluejays — Ryan Hawkins with a season-high 30 points and 12 rebounds and Ryan Kalkenbrenner with a career-high 22 points and 15 rebounds — had double-doubles and Creighton had a season-high 26 assists on the way to defeating the Hoyas, and in the rematch two days later in Omaha, the Hoyas gave up a career-high 27 points to Bluejays guard Alex O'Connell and another double-double to Hawkins (14 points and 10 rebounds). Kaiden Rice led the Hoyas with 24 points against DePaul and scored 16 points in the first Creighton game. Aminu Mohammed had a double-double (16 points and 10 rebounds) against DePaul, 11 points in the first Creighton game, and another double-double in the second Creighton game with a season-high 27 points and 10 rebounds. Donald Carey had 12 points against the Blue Demons, 16 in the first game against the Bluejays, and 12 against Creighton in the second game, while Dante Harris finished with 10 points in the first game against the Bluejays and had a career-high 23 points in the second Creighton game. The back-to-back losses to Creighton extended the Hoyas' school-record losing streak to 14 games, and it lengthened further when Georgetown lost at Marquette on February 16, with Collin Holloway leading the team with 15 points, Donald Carey and Dante Harris each adding 14, and Aminu Mohammed finishing with another double-double (13 points and 17 rebounds). The Marquette loss gave Georgetown a school-record 14 conference losses in a single season.\nGeorgetown next visited No. 10 Villanova, the winner of four in a row, in the 91st meeting of the teams. Georgetown fell behind 16–5 in the first minutes, but the Hoyas took advantage of poor Villanova outside shooting to close to 19–18 with 4:14 left in the first half. Villanova then finished the half with a 13–4 run. The Hoyas held Villanova's two top scorers — guards Collin Gillespie and Justin Moore — to 13-of-15 (13.3 percent) shooting from the field in the opening half, but themselves shot only 8-for-29 (27.6 percent) from the field and 3-of-14 (21.4 percent) in three-pointers, and Georgetown trailed 32–22 at halftime. Georgetown scored on two three-pointers to open the second half, cutting the Wildcats' lead to four. As the half continued, the Hoyas twice closed to a three-point deficit, including an 11–3 run that made the score 56–53 with 8:22 left to play, but Villanova then had a 10–4 run to pull ahead 66–57 with 4:19 remaining. The Wildcats went on to win 74–66, giving them a 46–45 edge in the series all-time, Villanova's first series lead since 7–6 in 1976. Donald Carey scored 24 points and Dante Harris added 16. The loss dropped Patrick Ewing's record as head coach against Big East opponents to 26–59.\nAfter five days off, Georgetown opened its final homestand of the year by hosting DePaul, which snapped a four-game losing streak and handed the Hoyas their 17th straight defeat by scoring on a layup and two free throws in the final 59 seconds for a 68–65 victory. Aminu Mohammed just missed a double-double with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Donald Carey scored 15 points and Jalin Billingsley 10 against the Blue Demons. Georgetown then closed out its home season on February 27 with its final Top-25 opponent of the year, No. 21 Connecticut, which had a four-game winning streak entering the game. The Huskies made 11 of 20 three-pointers against the Hoya defense, with seven different UConn players sinking at least one three-point shot. UConn led 41–26 at halftime, 66–46 with 11:27 remaining, and 81–59 with 2:53 left play. Georgetown made a late run, but Connecticut won 86–77. Dante Harris paced the Hoyas on offense with 23 points, while Aminu Mohammed had 16 and Donald Carey added 13. The loss concluded a winless February for the Hoyas, clinched a last-place conference finish for Georgetown for the first time in the combined history of the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 and the new Big East Conference, and dropped Patrick Ewing's career head-coaching record to 68–81.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the loss to Connecticut, the press asked Ewing about whether his job as head coach was secure, given the team's lack of success during the season, and he replied \"Of course I want to be back here...But in this position and this job, whatever happens will happen. I’m hoping that I’ll be back and doing something that I love at a place that I love and getting us back to being the king of the hill.\" On March 2, Georgetown University athletic director Lee Reed issued a public statement in support o Ewing, acknowledging the \"disappointment of a difficult season,\" but continuing: \"In this ever[-]evolving landscape of college athletics we are committed to Coach Ewing, and we are working with him to evaluate every aspect of the men’s basketball program and to make the necessary changes for him to put us back on the path to success for next year.\"\nGeorgetown closed out the regular season with two road games. In the first, held the evening of March 2 not long after Reed's statement that day, the Hoyas lost to Seton Hall, with Kaiden Rice leading the team with 17 points, Collin Holloway adding 16, Dante Harris finishing with 12, and Donald Carey scoring 11. Combining results in both the original Big East Conference of 1979–2013 and those of the Big East Conference formed in 2013, the loss tied the Big East record for losses in a season, matched only by 0–18 records posted by Miami in the 1993–1994 season and DePaul in the 2008–2009 season, during both of which Big East teams played 18-game conference schedules. In the season finale at Xavier three days later, the Musketeers broke a five-game losing streak to hand Georgetown its 20th loss overall and 19th conference loss in a row, setting a record for conference losses in a season by a Big East team. Dante Harris had 19 points, Collin Holloway added 17 points, and Aminu Mohammed finished with a double-double (15 points and 16 rebounds).\nGeorgetown became the first Big East team ever to post an 0-19 record in regular-season conference play and only the third to have a winless conference season. The loss to Xavier completed the first winless conference season in school history. It also was the first time Georgetown has finished in last place in Big East history, and Georgetown's only last-place finish in a conference other than in the 1934–1935 season, when the Hoyas finished last in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference.\nBig East tournament.\nSeeded 11th in the 2022 Big East tournament, Georgetown met the sixth seed, Seton Hall, in the first round at Madison Square Garden in New York City on March 9. After the Pirates scored the first four points of the game, the Hoyas took the lead with a 13–0 run to hold a 13–4 lead with 14:19 to play in the first half, Although Seton Hall clawed back, a 6–0 Hoya run gave Georgetown a 24–15 with 5:46 left in the half. The Hoyas led by as many as 10 points before Seton Hall whittled down the lead, and the Hoyas led 27–24 at halftime. In the second half, Georgetown led 37–33 with 15:04 left to play, 46–42 with 7:03 left, and 53–52 with 1:05 remaining in the game. The Hoyas did not score again, however, while Seton Hall scored five points in the final minute to win 57–53, bringing Georgetown's season to an end. Playing in their last game as Hoyas, Aminu Mohammed had a double-double with 12 points and 10 rebounds, Donald Carey and Collin Holloway each scored 11 points, and Timothy Ighoefe grabbed 13 rebounds and had a career-high four blocks. Georgetown finished the season with an overall record of 6–25. It was the greatest number of losses ever suffered by Georgetown in a single season, and the team's .194 winning percentage was the second-worst in school history, with only the .115 winning percentage of the 1971–1972 team ranking lower.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big East regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"|Big East tournament\nAwards and honors.\nBig East Conference honors.\nBig East All-Freshman Team.\nSources"

        "text": "The 2021–22 Munster Rugby season was Munster's twenty-first season competing in the United Rugby Championship, alongside which they also competed in the European Rugby Champions Cup. It was Johann van Graan's fifth and final season as head coach.\nEvents.\nThe big news in terms of player movements ahead of the 2021–22 season was the retirement of three club stalwarts: Billy Holland, CJ Stander and Tommy O'Donnell, and the return to the province of the club's record try scorer Simon Zebo after three seasons with French club Racing 92.\nFly-half JJ Hanrahan left the province to join French club Clermont, whilst winger Alex Wootton departed to join Connacht on a permanent basis, having spent the previous season on loan at the western province. Scrum-half Nick McCarthy left to re-join his native province Leinster, whilst prop James Cronin joined French club Biarritz, who had recently been promoted to the Top 14, and hooker Rhys Marshall was released by the province and returned to New Zealand, where he joined North Harbour. Centre Alex McHenry joined English club Wasps on loan in October 2021, and new signing Declan Moore joined Ulster as short-term injury cover in late December 2021 and on loan in February 2022.\nNine academy players were promoted to the senior squad: Thomas Ahern, Jack Crowley, Jack Daly, Jake Flannery, James French, Seán French, Ben Healy, John Hodnett and Josh Wycherley. South African lock Jason Jenkins joined the senior squad from Japanese club Toyota Verblitz, scrum-half Rowan Osborne joined from Leinster, and hooker Declan Moore, who was on the books with Australian Super Rugby side Melbourne Rebels, joined for the season. Shannon scrum-half Aran Hehir joined the senior squad in late February 2022 to provide cover whilst Craig Casey, Ethan Coughlan and Conor Murray were away on international duty and Rowan Osborne was injured.\nIn coaching news, former Munster assistant coach Ian Costello returned to the province to become their academy manager, having spent the previous five seasons working in England as head coach of RFU Championship club Nottingham and, since 2018, defence coach at Premiership club Wasps. Sports psychologist Caroline Currid, renowned in Ireland for her work with the Limerick hurlers who won back-to-back All-Ireland's in 2020 and 2021, joined the province's backroom team in a part-time role.\nThree players joined year one of the academy: prop Mark Donnelly, back-row Daniel Okeke and scrum-half Ethan Coughlan, whilst Leinster academy scrum-half Paddy Patterson, who spent part of the previous season on a short-term contract with Munster, joined year three of the academy. Three additional players joined the academy in November 2021: lock Edwin Edogbo, fly-half Tony Butler and back-three Patrick Campbell.\nWith the four South African Super Rugby teams - the , the , the and the - joining the league ahead of the 2021–22 season, the Pro14 was rebranded and restructured as the United Rugby Championship. The teams were divided into regional pools, with Munster joining their provincial rivals Connacht, Leinster and Ulster in the Irish pool. The regular season took place over 18 rounds; Munster played their pool opponents home and away, and played home or away fixtures against the other 12 teams in the league. All sixteen teams were ranked in one league table after the 18 rounds, with the top 8 teams qualifying for the quarter-finals, followed by semi-finals and a grand final.\nEight teams qualified from the United Rugby Championship for the Champions Cup. The highest ranked team from each pool qualified for the Champions Cup, with the remaining four qualification spots going to the next four highest-ranked teams in the single league table who have not already qualified from their pool. Subject to approvals, the South African teams will be eligible for the Champions &amp; Challenge Cup.\nThe province was drawn in pool B for the 2021–22 European Rugby Champions Cup pool stage, and faced French club Castres, whom Munster have met in nine previous Champions Cup seasons in a record 16 fixtures, and English club Wasps, who defeated Munster in a classic semi-final in the old Lansdowne Road in 2004, and whom the province last met during the 2007–08 tournament, which Munster went on to win.\nMunster opened their 2021–22 United Rugby Championship campaign with a bonus-point 42–17 win against the Sharks, one of the four new South African teams, on 25 September 2021. Simon Zebo, making his return for the province, scored two tries, extending his club record to 62, with Gavin Coombes continuing his try-scoring exploits from the previous season with two tries of his own. Chris Cloete and player of the match Craig Casey also crossed the try line. Fly-half Joey Carbery scored seven points off the kicking tee, with his replacement Ben Healy contributing five points off the tee in the second-half. RG Snyman made his eagerly-awaited return from long-term injury as a second-half replacement, and scrum-half Rowan Osborne made his competitive debut for the province, in a match that saw fans return to Thomond Park for the first time since February 2020.\nMunster were in South Africa for rounds 6 and 7 of the United Rugby Championship, in which they were due to play the and the , however, the emergence of the \"omicron\" variant of COVID-19 led to travel restrictions being implemented by UK and EU authorities, meaning the fixtures had to be postponed. 34 players and staff arrived back in Ireland on 1 December 2021 and immediately entered 10 days of mandatory self-isolation. 14 players and staff who had tested positive for COVID-19 had to remain in South Africa.\nIn the wake of this disruption for Munster and other clubs, and with Munster's opening Champions Cup fixture away to Wasps falling on 12 December, the EPCR extended the deadline for registering players for the tournament to 8 December, meaning Munster could look to supplement their squad with short-term signings, and 22 players were subsequently registered with the province's Champions Cup squad.\nA depleted Munster squad made up of internationals who'd been away with Ireland during the Autumn tests, academy players and members of the national and provincial talent squads travelled over to England to face Wasps on their opening Champions Cup fixture on 12 December 2021. The team, which featured 12 debutantes, pulled off one of the great Munster away victories, defeating their opponents 35–14 in a thrilling contest in front of a large contingent of Munster fans who had made the journey to Coventry.\nMunster made it back-to-back wins in the Champions Cup with a gritty 19–13 win at home against French club Castres on 18 December 2021, with a 58th minute try from number 8 Jack O'Donoghue and 14 points off the tee from fly-half Ben Healy being enough for the province to see off their opposition.\nFollowing the 10–8 defeat away to Connacht on 1 January 2022, the province received criticism for its style of play, or lack thereof, aimed in particular at head coach Johann van Graan, who had recently confirmed his departure from the province at the end of the season. Critics also pointed to the poor performance in defeat against the Ospreys back in October 2021, prior to the COVID-19 issues the province faced in South Africa and the first two rounds of the Champions Cup, and also to the dour win against Castres in round two of the Champions Cup. Former captain Donal Lenihan, writing in the \"Irish Examiner\", said: \"If Munster continue in the vein of the last two limp attacking efforts against Castres and Connacht, then you can forget about any prospect of breaking the trophy drought for another season,\", whilst club legend Alan Quinlan described the performance against Connacht as \"dreadful\", before adding; \"Look, you have to acknowledge there has been a lot of good in the last few years, I do want to say that.\".\nEddie O'Sullivan, former Ireland coach and Munster player, added: \"If you want a cameo to show people how Munster have not developed in attack, show them the last five minutes of that first half against Connacht.\". Keith Wood, another former Munster player and an Ireland legend, was similarly critical of the province, describing the display against Connacht as \"turgid nonsense\", adding \"There's no point in talking about Munster's attack, that doesn’t exist at the present moment in time. I think we're beginning to ruin some of the players. I'm finding it incredibly hard to watch.\" Munster forwards coach Graham Rowntree, speaking to the media ahead of the province's fixture against Ulster the following week, described the performance as \"more than disappointing\" and \"very frustrating\", but added that a series of clear-the-air meetings had been held, saying \"It can only be good to get it all out on the table and clear the air and people air some things.\".\nIn the reverse fixture against Castres in round 3 of the Champions Cup on 14 January 2022, Munster earned a 16–13 away win thanks to a 77th minute try from Gavin Coombes, converted by rookie fly-half Jack Crowley, who was faultless off the kicking tee in his first European start for the province. The win secured a place in the knockout stage of the tournament for Munster. Nine days later, Munster followed up their away win against Castres with a 45–7 home win against Wasps, with the tries coming from Jeremy Loughman, Conor Murray, Jack O'Donoghue, who was player of the match on the occasion of his 150th cap for Munster, Rory Scannell and Simon Zebo, who scored a brace to become Munster's all-time leading try-scorer in the Champions Cup and the leading Irish try-scorer in the competition overall. Fly-half Ben Healy and his replacement on the day, Jack Crowley, were both 100% from the kicking tee, with Healy scoring four conversions and a penalty, and Crowley adding two late conversions. The win secured home advantage for Munster in the second leg of the round of 16.\nMunster faced English club Exeter Chiefs in the round of 16, and lost the first leg of the tie 13–8 away to the Premiership club on 9 April 2022. Exeter took a 10–0 lead in to half-time after tries from Stuart Hogg and Jacques Vermeulen, before Munster fly-half Ben Healy hit back with a penalty to reduce the home sides lead. Hogg responded for Exeter with a drop-goal, but a 66th minute try from Shane Daly brought Munster back within touching distance on the scoreboard, and Exeter had to withstand some intense offensive play from Munster going into the final ten minutes, with replacement scrum-half Craig Casey almost drawing the scores level, before the hosts themselves assaulted the Munster try-line in the last minutes of the match in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to extend their lead.\nNeeding to overturn a five point deficit to advance in the competition, Munster welcomed Exeter to Thomond Park for the second leg of their last 16 tie one week later. Fly-half Joey Carbery, returning from injury, opened the scoring for the hosts with a penalty, but the visitors responded with their first try of the game to take an early 5–3 lead, before Carbery struck back for Munster with a try of his own, to which he added a second penalty to give Munster a 13–5 half-time lead. Exeter struck first in the second-half with a try in the 47th minute, but Carbery kept Munster in front with two further penalties, before centre Damian de Allende scored a 74th minute try to secure a 26–10 home win for Munster and a 34–23 victory on aggregate, ensuring Munster progressed to a record 19th Champions Cup quarter-final.\nFacing defending champions Toulouse, who knocked the province out of the previous season's tournament, in the quarter-final, Munster began strongly with an 11th minute Alex Kendellen try, converted by Joey Carbery to lead 7–0, but Romain Ntamack hit back for Toulouse two minutes later with a try of his own, converted by Thomas Ramos, to level the scores. The visitors were dominating the scrum and scored their second try in the 25th minute when Matthis Lebel touched down, with Ramos again converting to give Toulouse a 14–7 lead. However, Munster struck back with a Keith Earls try just before half-time which Carbery converted to leave the scores level heading into the break. The home side came out firing in the second-half, with Mike Haley scoring a 43rd minute try, again converted by Carbery, to give Munster a 21–14 lead, which Carbery extended with a penalty in the 56th minute, but Toulouse responded with Lebel's second try in the 66th minute which, when converted by Ramos, reduced the margin to just three points heading into the final ten minutes. A 75th minute penalty from Ramos levelled the scores at 24–24, and that remained the score at full-time after Ben Healy missed with a 56 metre penalty attempt in the final minute of normal time.\nWith the scores level at full-time and as both teams scored three tries, extra time ensued, played over two ten-minute halves, but even after that the two teams could not be separated after three missed drop goals between the two, and the game went to a penalty shootout. Munster went first and Conor Murray scored his penalty. Antoine Dupont responded successfully for Toulouse, but Ben Healy missed his first attempt, and when Thomas Ramos scored his penalty, it was advantage Toulouse. Carbery scored his penalty, but Romain Ntamack scored his own to restore Toulouse's lead. Murray missed with his second attempt, whilst Dupont was successful with his own to give Toulouse a 4–2 lead, meaning Healy had to score with his second attempt to give Munster any hope, but he was unable to do so, and Toulouse advanced to the semi-finals, knocking Munster out of the competition for the second season in a row.\nA 35–25 defeat away to Leinster in round 18 of the 2021–22 United Rugby Championship meant that Munster finished sixth in the league overall, and third in the Irish Shield, and the province headed north to face Ulster in the quarter-finals on 3 June 2022, but Munster lost 36–17 to bring the curtain down on their 2021–22 season, as well as Johann van Graan's tenure as head coach.\nPlayer movements.\nBelow are the players who joined and left the Munster senior and academy squads ahead of the 2021–22 season. \"Italics\" indicates players that transferred during the 2021–22 season.\nSenior squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nAcademy squad.\nPlayers in\nPlayers out\nCoaches and staff.\nSenior squad\nAcademy squad\nPlayers.\nAdditional players.\nThese 19 players were registered with Munster's Champions Cup squad in December 2021 following the disruption caused by the province's recent tour to South Africa, and are National Talent Squad or Provincial Talent Squad members.

        "title": "2020–21 Quinnipiac Bobcats men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2020–21 Quinnipiac Bobcats Men's ice hockey season was the 45th season of play for the program, the 23rd at the Division I level and the 16th season in the ECAC Hockey conference. The Bobcats represented the Quinnipiac University and played their home games at the Frank Perrotti, Jr. Arena in the People's United Center, and were coached by Rand Pecknold, in his 27th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Quinnipiac's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nQuinnipiac was one of the few teams to play a decent amount of non-conference games during the 20–21 season. The Bobcats played their first 8 games against teams not in ECAC Hockey and performed well, going 6–2. The team continued that level of play throughout the season, consistently being ranked near the middle of the top-20. The stars of the season were team captain Odeen Tufto and starting goaltender Keith Petruzzelli, both seniors. Tufto led the team in scoring by a wide margin, finishing the year with 47 points and was second in the nation. Petruzzelli backstopped the team to a league title and was named as the best goaltender in the conference, allowing less than 2 goals per game on the year.\nWith their stellar record, the Bobcats were all but guaranteed a spot in the NCAA Tournament but the team still wanted to earn capture the ECAC championship. Due to 8 of the 12 ECAC teams cancelling their seasons, Quinnipiac would only have to win two games to win the crown. However, due to Clarkson cancelling its season after COVID protocol violations, Quinnipiac received a bye into the title game, becoming the first team at the Division I level to play a one-off game for an automatic bid since 1960. In the title game the Bobcats started slow, recording just 4 shots in the first period, but took over in the middle frame. After taking a 2–1 lead into the third, Quinnipiac tried to win a 1-goal game but St. Lawrence fought back and tied the score with less than 5 minutes to play. The game went into overtime and, after less than 4 minutes, Quinnipiac found themselves on the wrong side of the winning goal, losing the title to the Larries.\nA day after the conference tournament, St. Lawrence's head coach tested positive for COVID and the team was forced to withdraw from the NCAA tournament. As a result, Quinnipiac was given the ECAC automatic bid instead, though it was likely that the team would have been selected as an at-large bid anyway. In their opening game of the tournament, Quinnipiac showed none of the hesitancy that they had the game before and roared out to a 2-goal lead after 20 minutes. Once they had their advantage, however, the team slowed in the middle and allowed Minnesota State to cut their lead in half. A more even third period saw the Bobcats restore their 2-goal edge but the Mavericks wouldn't go away and, over the course of the final 11 minutes, Quinnipiac's lead was eroded and MSU tied the game with just over a minute to play. With the team having once again blown a lead, the Bobcats were overwhelmed in the extra session and were outshot 7–2 before Minnesota State ended their season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Red Cloud played as members of the Central Nebraska League (1903) and Nebraska State League (1910). The Red Cloud moniker was cited locally as the \"Indians\".\nHistory.\nRed Cloud first fielded a minor league team as members of the short–lived 1903 Central Nebraska League, an Independent level league. The 1903 league standings through July 24, as reported in local newspapers, had the Red Cloud Indians in with fourth place with an 8–16 record, 10.0 games behind the first place Holdrege Silver Ashes on that date.\nThe five members of the 1903 Central Nebraska League were the teams based in Giltner, Holdrege, McCook, Minden joining Red Cloud, Nebraska.The other league teams were without known monikers, common in the era.\nWhile the 1903 league records and statistics are unknown, player rosters are known. The Central Nebraska League permanently folded after the 1903 season.\nIn 1910, minor league baseball returned to Red Cloud. The Red Cloud \"Indians\" team became charter members of the reformed Class D level Nebraska State League. Joining Red Cloud in the eight–team league were the Columbus Discoverers, Grand Island Collegians, Fremont Pathfinders, Hastings Brickmakers, Kearney Kapitalists, Seward Statesmen and Superior Brickmakers teams. The 1910 Nebraska State League set a salary limit of $900.00 and a roster limit of 12 players.\nThe Red Cloud franchise was referred to as the \"Indians\" in both the Fremont and Kearney newspapers.\nOn the opening day in Red Cloud, mayor Dahlman of Omaha, Nebraska threw out the first pitch. An automobile parade and the Red Cloud High School band provided the pregame festivities. Clarence Mitchell pitched Red Cloud to a 5–0 victory in the opener.\nIn the 1910 season, their final season of play, Red Cloud finished the season in seventh place. With an overall record of 47–62, Red Cloud played under manager Ben F. Grant. The Fremont Pathfinders finished first in the standings with a 63–42 record, finishing 4.5 games ahead of the second place Columbus Discoverers and 17.5 games ahead of Red Cloud. Red Cloud drew 10,126 total fans for the season. Fred Jarrott of Red Cloud led the Nebraska State League in batting average and hits, hitting .326 with 126 total hits.\nSunday laws affected the league teams. In July, 1910, Justice Gladwish had the Red Cloud and Seward teams arrested for playing a game on Sunday. The two teams had played the game in Staplehurst, Nebraska a town which did not enforce the Sunday baseball laws. However, the Judge decided to prosecute the case on his own.\nThe taverns of Red Cloud pledged close to $500.00 to support the 1910 team as part of a campaign to keep the city of Red Cloud \"wet\". The City of Red Cloud scheduled a vote on the alcohol issue on the ballot in the spring of 1910. Red Cloud voters passed the issue and the town became dry in the spring of 1910. The taverns closed as a result of the election and the Red Cloud franchise struggled financially during the season.\nIn the 1911 Nebraska State League, the Red Cloud franchise did nit return to the league. The Red Cloud franchise was replaced by the York Prohibitionists in league play. Red Cloud has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Red Cloud teams hosted home minor league home games at the City Park in Red Cloud. Founded in 1871, Red Cloud City Park is still in use as a public park, located at Cedar Street &amp; 2nd Avenue in Red Cloud, Nebraska.\nExternal links.\nRed Cloud - Baseball Reference"

At one point they threatened to run away with the title when after 9 rounds they had a 4-point lead over their nearest challengers. However a loss to Ponsonby United in round 10, a draw with Manukau in round 12, and a loss to Marist Old Boys in round 13 meant that the title was not decided until the final round. They however beat the wooden spooners Newton Rangers 30–9 to secure the title.\nAfter a disappointing 1936 season Marist Old Boys finished 3rd in the Fox Memorial, one point behind Richmond and then went on to win the Roope Rooster knockout competition with wins over Newton Rangers, City Rovers, and Ponsonby United 25–10 in the final. They then defeated Richmond Rovers in the Stormont Shield champion of champions match 12–5. They were helped significantly by the record breaking point scoring of John Anderson. He scored 154 points through all matches for Marist during the season which was comfortably the most in Auckland Rugby League club history with only Bill Davidson (116) in 1922, and Frank Delgrosso (108) in 1929 even passing the 100 point mark.\nNorth Shore Albions won the Phelan Shield after being knocked out of the Roope Rooster competition in the first round. They beat Richmond, Manukau and then Mount Albert in the final 22–18. Richmond won the reserve grade title (Norton Cup). Marist won the reserve grade knockout competition (Stallard Cup) by defeating Ponsonby 22–5 in the final.\nThe 9 team Senior B grade was won once again by Papakura who finished with a 14 win, 1 loss record to lead the trailing Point Chevalier who finished with 11 wins and 3 losses. Papakura also won the knockout competition when they defeated Green Lane 19–7 in the final.\nThe representative season saw Auckland beat Auckland Māori 24–14, followed by wins on the same day over South Auckland (Waikato) 26–12, and Taranaki (27-10), though 2 separate teams were obviously used. At the end of the season an injury depleted Auckland side lost to a very strong New Zealand Māori team 43–21. The New Zealand Māori side had earlier defeated the touring Australian side and included George Nēpia.

Lee speaking at length as president about the importance of sport for the health of men and women. He went on to say “you know I consider that all the defeats, or rather, disabilities, this code has had, and had overcome, have welded it strongly... we like the other game, and good fellows we know are playing it, but we think and know our game is better. In other words, we like the other game, Rugby Union, but we like our own game best. It may be an offshoot. I suppose it is a case of the juvenile being better than the parent (Applause).

It was decided that the season would begin on April 17 when a preliminary round of two Saturdays will be started and a night match may be arranged with the championship officially opening on May 1. Senior team nominations would be dealt with on April 14.\nCoronation dance.\nOn May 11 the Auckland Rugby League held a Coronation dance at the Peter Pan venue. Over 800 people attended with music being supplied by Theo Walter's Band.\nAuckland representative team.\nAt the control board meeting on April 14 it was decided to appoint Hec Brisbane as the sole Auckland selector for the season. Brisbane was a former New Zealand international (50 matches including 10 tests), Auckland representative (14 matches from 1923 to 1933), and who had played for and captained Marist Old Boys from 1923 to 1934 in 156 matches.\nAustralian visit and St George request.\nIn August the Australian side played two tests against New Zealand and another midweek match against New Zealand Māori. All three matches were played at Carlaw Park. New Zealand lost the first test 12–8, before winning the second test 16-15 while New Zealand Māori defeated Australia 16–5. Following the matches Ernie Asher, on behalf of the Māori Control Board presented the ARL committee with a framed photograph of the team. Chairman Mr. G. Grey Campbell “pointed out that the victory was a historic event in league history”. St. George cabled the ARL on September 2 requesting the opportunity to tour for three matches at some point on or after September 18 however the ARL regrettedly declined as it had been a long season and the national side had already played matches in Auckland. They had also offered to have Frank Burge the former international forward coach the Auckland team for two weeks whilst here.\nFirst grade competition.\nThe same teams as 1936 all nominated sides to compete in the Fox Memorial championship once again. The ARL decided to play 2 preliminary rounds in mid and late April before commencing the season proper on May 1. Prior to the opening round of preliminary games the Auckland Star wrote: Manukau, with a pack averaging over 14st per man, will include “Logan, the Central Hawke's Bay representative five eighths. Their challenge will be met confidently by Richmond, who recently teamed brilliantly in the trial at Morningside, where the new forwards, Jack McLeod, the Taranaki representative, and Mitchell, of Wairarapa, were conspicuous. Ponsonby, now coached by R. McIntyre, the ex-Ponsonby and Auckland representatives, are in the best of trim for their battle with Mount Albert, and the teams may provide a surprise or two. Newton will miss Ted Brimble, who is at present in hospital, but the back division will include their promising centre, Sissons, with Dempsey as custodian. The team is being coached by George Morman, who captained the Rangers when they won the championship in 1927... Marists will present a powerful vanguard against City. The Rovers will have the services of moody, a big Bay of Plenty forward from Taneatua, and Potier, the South Auckland representative halfback, among several other alterations. Three Navy players, Fitzgerald, at centre, and Donaldson and Boyle, forwards, will appear for the green and golds”. The New Zealand Herald reported that “Richmond will be considerably strengthened by A. E. Cooke, the international, who retired last season, but has decided to play again. Manukau will field practically the same side as that last year, Hemi, Pickrang, and Brodrick all being available. It is doubtful whether Trevarthan, who is at present in the south, will turn out”.\nAfter the first weekend of preliminary games the New Zealand Herald wrote a lengthy article on the personnel in each side. Manukau fielded “the same team as that last year. Its forwards included Jack Brodrick, Len Kawe, Jack Whye, Angus Gault, and new players Phillips and Meredith, a hooker... Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene will again lead the team... however, he may play in the forwards”. Jack Hemi appeared to have recovered from his leg injury of late last season, while Shalfoon, a newcomer to the team, showed a fine burst of speed on the wing. Hollis is a rugged type of five-eighths, and should get plenty of opportunities from Peter Mahima, who will be the other halfback”. Other backs include Jack (Joe) Broughton, an ex-Wairarapa representative three quarter. Richmond would field Jack Satherley at hooker, with Bill Telford, Harold Tetley, and Alf Broadhead in the side with Metcalfe showing good form with Leo Davis being another promising forward. Noel Bickerton and Roy Powell would be in the halves once again.\nMarist had promoted a promising junior, Donovan who was clever on attack. Crocker was new at half back with Glover again at fullback. Haslam was again in the side, with Fitzgerald, Murdoch, and Bakalich in the backs. Their forwards would be made up of John Anderson, Bill Breed, Kenneth Finlayson, and McGreal, along with Bogle and Donaldson who had been with the navy ship H.M.S. Philomel. Mount Albert had appeared to be the fittest looking team after the preliminary matches and would have a strong forward pack. Peterson, a Hawke's Bay forward who was with Mount Albert had transferred to Ponsonby with his place being filled by E. Satherley of Richmond. Hanson had been promoted from the 3rd grade side and Des Herring, Richard Shadbolt, Noel Bickerton, and Allen were all available. The backs would like be made up of Halsey, Wilf Hassan, and the three Schultz brothers.\nThe City Rovers side had lost Lou Brown but had gained Joseph Hapi. Hutchinson had been promoted from 3rd grade while Lynch joined the side from Matamata. Other backs included McLaughlin, Jack Tawhai, and Jackie Rata with Cyril Wiberg at fullback. The forwards would include Spiro, Johnson, McCarthy, and moody (a rugby recruit). Raymond from Poverty Bay was in the forwards, while J. Webner from the Addington club in Christchurch had also joined the side. For North Shore Albions, Vanich and Sterling had joined the side and looked promising. Jack Smith was a promoted junior who was fast and clever. Len Scott and Verdun Scott would be on the wings with Cowan at halfback. The forwards would be light, but very experienced consisted of Simpson, Horace Hunt, Reg Hollows, E (Ted) Scott, Rogers, and Barnett.\nNewton were said to be the weakest looking of all the sides and had not trained well. Claude Dempsey, Sissons, Young, and Ted Brimble were all still in the side. The forwards would include Ellis, Cairns, Proctor, Surtees, Beatty, and Joseph Ginders. Ponsonby would be fielding a young side. They were rumoured to be losing Brian Riley but he did ultimately play for them again. Miles was available at full back with Black at half back. Stockley, Arthur Kay, Frank Halloran, and Jones were all said to be playing again. New forwards included Dan Keane, Blackman, and Eade.\nHawea Mataira and George Nēpia switch to rugby league.\nOn June 8 it was reported in the New Zealand Herald that All Black and Hawke's Bay rugby representative Hawea Mataira was joining the City Rovers. He was a forward and had represented the All Blacks on their Australian tour in 1934. He also toured Australia with the Māori All Blacks in 1935 under the captaincy of George Nēpia.\nClub visits to other centres.\nOn June 19 six of the Auckland senior sides travelled throughout the North Island to play various local sides. Carlaw Park was unavailable that weekend as the ARL had made it available for the second soccer test match. Ponsonby travelled to Wellington, North Shore to Huntly, Mount Albert to New Plymouth, Marist to Whangarei, Manukau to Taneatua in the Bay of Plenty, and City to Tokaanu to play Taupo. The match between Taupo and City at Tokaanu was the first ever match of either oval ball code in the area.\nSenior B and second grades.\nAt the annual meeting for the Papakura club Mr. A. Wilkie (chairman of the ARL Junior Board) said he “deplored the lack of good competition in the senior B grade last season...[and that] this had been the matter of serious consideration during the recess and the Junior Board had recommended to the Auckland league that the second grade be abolished. This would bring about ten teams into the senior B grade and tend to make the competition far more interesting in the coming season”. It was ultimately decided that the Senior B and 2nd Grades would be “amalgamated in order to increase competition between the open-weight grades”.\nCarlaw trophy.\nMr. Harold Walmsley donated a trophy in memory of James Carlaw which consisted of “inlaid New Zealand woods on three tiers with the pioneer administrator's photograph inset in the top square it is surmounted by goal posts and a silver football. The trophy was to be dedicated to the annual representative Pakeha – Māori match.\nCarlaw Park.\nAt the control board meeting on March 17 it was reported that further improvements of the terraces at Carlaw Park were being carried out “for the convenience of patrons”. The terraces were “bitumised during the summer months”. At the time of the opening round it was reported that the league proposed to pad the entire length of the picket fence along the side line which ran on the city side of the field to prevent injury. Following the round 3 matches the grounds committee reported that the No. 2 ground was in “bad condition, and it was desirable to give the area some relief if possible”. The control board decided to defer the allocation of the City v Newton, and Marist v Richmond round 4 matches. In mid October it was announced that Carlaw park was to see the installation of floodlighting with a tender having been accepted. Chairman Campbell said “the board has been considering the question of night football for some time past... and we desire to make the ground a more attractive centre where athletic sports, boxing, wrestling, band contests and other attractions may be staged to the best advantage”. The introduction of the lighting would mean that four steel towers would need to be erected to “carry the clusters of fittings for the lights”. The work would take about two months to complete but would not interfere with the use of the park for public gatherings.\nAt an October meeting of the control board Mr. Culpan reported that a special South African grass which had been recommended by Mr. P. W. Day, manager of the Springboks, “had already been tried with success at Carlaw Park. The new grass was proving efficacious on bad parts of the playing areas.\nDevonport United becomes North Shore Albion once again.\nAt their annual club meeting on March 17 there was discussion of the name of the Devonport United club. “Owing to the district restriction implied by the name “Devonport”, and the fact that the team was always called “Shore”, Mr. H. Mann was supported in a proposal for a reversion to the club's old name, North Shore Albion Rugby League Club”. The name of Devonport United had been adopted when North Shore Albions merged with the Sunnyside club many years earlier and the Sunnyside members refused to accept the name of North Shore. The motion to change the name back to North Shore Albions was adopted.\nOtahuhu ground issues.\nIn 1936 the Otahuhu Borough Council had controversially granted exclusive use of Sturges Park to the Otahuhu Rugby Club despite strong protests from Auckland Rugby League via multiple delegations to speak to the council. Then in 1937 when the issue was being revisited the Auckland Rugby League submitted a tender where they would pay £30 per annum, plus give 33.33% of gross takings on match days minus costs and guaranteed a minimum payment of £55 a season. They would play at least four senior A matches and 12 senior B matches there with other first class junior matches. The Otahuhu Rugby Club tender was the same as the previous year which was a 20 percent share of the gate with a guarantee to play 12 senior games. The council had anticipated this would net £75 the previous year but it had not and the poor weather was said to be to blame. The council who included Mayor Charles Robert Petrie and was in fact the Otahuhu RL clubs patron, heard the tenders and then spent 15 minutes in special committee before deciding that they “had no option but to renew the lease with the rugby union according to last year's agreement” with legal advice confirming this opinion. Sturges Park was then leased to the Rugby Union for a period of 5 years.\nState of Grey Lynn Park.\nIn late July Northcote and Birkenhead complained in a letter to the ARL about the state of Grey Lynn Park after arriving to play Richmond. The letter said that they had feared they had arrived at the wrong place and instead had arrived in an area “reputed for bovine aromas and mudflats”. It was said to be “a sea of mud, eight or nine inches deep in some places, and the smell had to be experienced to be appreciated”. The letter went on to say that they “hoped that no further games be allotted to Grey Lynn Park until the city fathers install a drainage system”. The league decided not to arrange for any more matches at the park until it was in a proper condition for play.\nSenior grade competitions.\nFollowing round 9 the ARL decided to rework the draw because Richmond was comfortably first (by 4 points with 5 matches to play) and they may be able to conclude the competition early.\nAt the ARL meeting on October 6 Wally Tittleton of the Richmond club was announced as being awarded a special trophy for the outstanding senior grade player. The award was made by the donor Mr. J.F.W. Dickson and was for consistently good play throughout the season. Tittleton had also won selection for Auckland and New Zealand during the year.\nPresident of New Zealand Rugby League, Cyril Snedden donated a special trophy to John Anderson who registered a total of 148 points (or 154 according to the other report) and E. Bennett of Takapuna gave Jack Smith a trophy for scoring 132 points. It was said in an article later that he had scored 162 points. Though this would likely also include Auckland matches.\nSenior A grade fixtures.\nPreliminary round 1.\nIt was rumoured that Bert Cooke was going to come out of retirement to play again for Richmond however he did not appear in their first practice match.\nPreliminary round 2.\nBill Schultz of Mount Albert fractured his leg in their match with City. Charles Dunn also of Mount Albert broke his jaw and both players were taken to Auckland Hospital. Wilf Hassan injured his shoulder badly and was set to miss several weeks. Donald Fraser was concussed while playing for Newton.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 1.\nBert Cooke played and was said to be “superlative” however he was late tackled and was limping at the end of the game. This was to be his last ever rugby league appearance. He began coaching the North Shore rugby senior side for the remainder of the year.\nRound 2.\nFrank Thompson refereed his 50th 1st grade match when he had control of the Mt Albert - City match. He became the 7th referee to achieve this feat.\nRound 3.\nA week after Frank Thompson achieved the feat, Wilfred Simpson became the 8th Auckland Rugby League referee to referee 50 matches between first grade sides when Richmond played City.\nRound 4.\nIn Marists heavy defeat at the hands of Richmond they lost Glover and Gordon Midgley to injury and played most of the second half with 11 players. The City v Newton match was originally supposed to be played at Carlaw Park but after the number 2 field was declared in a poor state the match was moved to Glen Eden.\nRound 5.\nThe match between Richmond and Newton was played at Fowld's Park to raise money for the King George V. Memorial Fund. The game was ceremonially kicked off by the Mayor of Mount Albert, Mr. Henry Albert Anderson.\nRound 7.\nA 1934 New Zealand rugby union player, Hawea Mataira switched codes and made his debut appearance for Manukau. Tom Chase and Rangi Chase both had also switched codes and debuted for Manukau also. Tom had been a representative player for Whanganui and a Māori All Black, while his younger brother Rangi had also played 3 matches for Whanganui in 1936. All three would go on to represent New Zealand at rugby league. Rangi scored 3 tries and kicked a drop goal in his first appearance for Manukau.\nRound 8.\nRound 8 was initially scheduled to be played on June 26 but all rugby league in Auckland, along with several other outdoor sports was cancelled due to poor weather. Frank Pickrang transferred from Manukau to Ponsonby and made his debut for his new side. He had been trying to move for some time but chose to stand down due to transfer difficulties. Joining him at Ponsonby at the same time was fellow Kiwi, Joe Cootes who was transferring from Wellington.\nPhelan Shield.\nSemi finals.\nIn the semi-final between City and Mt Albert, Stuart Billman became the 9th referee to officiate in 50 matches between first grade sides in Auckland Rugby League history.\nStormont Shield.\nJohn Anderson capped a truly remarkable point scoring season by scoring all 12 of Marist's points, made up of 2 tries, a conversion, a penalty, and a drop goal. It was Marist's 4th Stormont Shield win with the previous being in 1928, 1929, and 1932. The win denied Richmond what would have been their 4th straight Stormont Shield victory. At the conclusion of the match John Stormont, the father of Bill Stormont who the trophy was named in honour of after his death mid season in 1925 presented the Marist players with medals.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe point scoring lists are compiled from matches played in the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield and Stormont Shield matches which all first grade sides were eligible for competing in (provided they avoided elimination from the knock out competitions). The top point scorer was once again John Anderson. He scored 143 points in the aforementioned competitive matches and also scored in preliminary matches and in a Marist tour match which were not included in his statistics. Jack Smith finished second with 87 points. Both players would go on to represent New Zealand in 1938. The top try scorer was William McCallum for Mount Albert who was in his first season for them.\n \nSenior reserve competitions.\nThere were several rounds of the senior reserve grade competition that had no results reported. These were rounds 7 where only 1 result was reported, and rounds 11, 13, and 14 where no results were reported at all. It is possible that Richmond Rovers had won the competition by the latter stages and so the fixtures became optional and possibly not played or of no championship significance and so therefore not reported by club officials. The Auckland Rugby League would often conclude competitions prematurely if a champion had already been found.\nSenior B grade competitions.\nSharman Cup fixtures.\nThe competition was won by Papakura who finished with a 14 win, 1 loss record. Fixtures were listed each week in \"The New Zealand Herald\" and Auckland Star however results were often not published. Following round 14 the Auckland Star published the points table to that point which indicated who the victors in several of the unreported matches were.\nFollowing their round 2 match Manukau were advised that their team was out of order. They then defaulted their round 3 match after being given one more week to get their team in order before resuming in round 4. Glenora withdrew from the competition after defaulting in round 3. The round 6 loss by Papakura was their first loss for 3 seasons. In about round 15 both Manukau and Mount Albert withdrew from the competition as they were no longer listed in any fixtures form this point. At the September 7 meeting Papakura were congratulated on winning the Senior B competition. They had scored 304 points during the competition and only conceded 72.\nWalmsley Shield knockout competition.\nManukau and Mount Albert did not enter teams. Newton was initially drawn to play Papakura in round 1 but withdrew and instead Papakura travelled to Huntly to play the local side instead. Glenora entered a team but were knocked out in the first round by Point Chevalier. R.V. and Northcote &amp; Birkenhead received bye's in round 1. Richmond drew with Green Lane in round 1 which forced the teams into a replay the following weekend which Green Lane won. Papakura had a bye in this round. Papakura defeated Point Chevalier in the 3rd weekend of the competition and so joined Green Lane in the final with Papakura running out 19–7 winners.\nSenior club matches.\nPonsonby XIII v Huntly.\nOn Sunday, August 29 a Ponsonby XIII played Huntly at Swanson in West Auckland. A shield was presented to the winners (Ponsonby) after the match by Mr. L. Adams to the Ponsonby captain for the day, Stan Prentice, the former New Zealand international and Richmond club player. The shield had been donated by Mr. I. Culpan.\nRichmond reserves v Kamo.\nThe Richmond reserve side travelled to Whangarei to play the Northland senior club champions on August 28. The Richmond side won by 27 points to 17.\nLower Grades.\nThere were 5 lower grades in 1937 (Third Grade to Seventh Grade). This was a reduction of 1 on the previous season as the Second Grade was forced into the Senior B grade. There were an additional 3 schoolboy grades (Junior, Intermediate, and Senior).\nRichmond Rovers once again won the Davis Points Shield for winning the most points through all club teams. City Rovers finished runners up. Papakura won the Tracy Inglis points trophy for junior clubs with Otahuhu runners up.\n3rd Grade (Walker Cup).\nOtahuhu won section 1 while Richmond won section 2. The two teams met in the championship final on August 21 with Otahuhu winning 13 to 6. Ellerslie won the third grade knockout competition when they defeated Otahuhu 18 to 6 on September 11 after they had beaten Papakura 11–2 in one semi final and Otahuhu had beaten Marist 20–12 in the other. Otahuhu's record for the entire season was 14 wins, 1 loss, for 234 and against 59, gleaned from their team photo which hangs in their clubroom. Several sides played matches against teams from out of Auckland near the conclusion of the season including Papakura B against Hikurangi (12-8), RV against One Tree Hill Point, Otahuhu against Taneatua (28-8), Mount Albert against Portland (Whangarei) (8-5), and Glenora against Ngaruawahia (5-5).\nSection 2.\nNewton withdrew after round 6 following three consecutive default losses while North Shore fielded a team for a match against Newton and then withdrew.\n4th Grade (Hospital Cup).\nRichmond won the championship when they defeated Ellerslie 10 to 5 in the final on July 24. Richmond also won the knockout competition with a 20–9 win over North Shore on September 4 after they beat Glenora 13–2 in one semi final with North Shore beating Ponsinby in the other. Point Chevalier defaulted their first match and then withdrew. Richmond played a friendly match with Huntly High School Old Boys on August 7, and Ellerslie played Ngaruawahia on September 11.\n5th Grade (Endean Shield).\nOtahuhu beat Richmond 17–5 in the championship final on August 28, with City winning the knockout competition when they defeated Otahuhu 16–0 in the final on September 11. City had beaten Avondale in the semi final while Otahuhu's win in the championship final had doubled as their semi final knockout match. On September 11 the Richmond side played Kamo in a friendly match.\n6th Grade (Rhodes Shield).\nCity won the sixth grade championship ahead of Green Lane. City was declared the winner of the sixth grade knockout competition by the junior management committee at their October 5 meeting. It appears that they had played 5 extra full rounds following the championship but not in a knockout style and City had the best record over that time.\n7th Grade (Myers Cup).\nNorth Shore Albions won the championship with Richmond runner up. Very few of North Shore's results were reported though they had obviously won more than Richmond's 10 wins. The for and against record of North Shore is made up of only 4 reported scores and is missing 10 other scores. Richmond won the knockout competition on October 2 when they beat North Shore 12 to 2. Point Chevalier defaulted their first match of the season to Otahuhu and then withdrew from the competition.\nSchoolboy competitions.\nThe majority of teams were affiliated with a club side and were made up of schoolboys from that areas schools rather than one school in particular.\nSenior (Rout Challenge).\nRichmond won the senior schoolboys championship with Marist runner up. The Avondale Convent team was made up of players from the school on the site of the present day St Mary's school in Avondale. They withdrew after 8 rounds, while the Northcote side withdrew after 8 rounds also. The Auckland representative team made up of the competitions best players beat Northland 12–5 on August 28, and South Auckland (Waikato) 17–5 on September 18.\nIntermediate championship.\nPonsonby won the championship when they beat Avondale in the final 3–0 on August 21. On September 11 Richmond defeated Newton 9–5 to win the knockout competition. Then a week later on September 18 a 'champion of champions' match was played between the championship winner (Ponsonby), and the knockout winner (Richmond), with Ponsonby winning by a single point, 9 to 8 to claim the title.\nJunior championship.\nNewton A, who won section A, won the crossover final by 6 points to 3 over the winners of section B, Northcote, on August 28. The George Courts team won the knockout competition on October 2 against Newton A by 3 points to 0.\nAuckland representative team.\nHec Brisbane was named the Auckland selector for the season.\nAuckland (Auckland Pākehā) v Auckland Māori (Tamaki).\nThe opening representative match of the season was played on Coronation Day. For all intents and purposes the Auckland team was the Auckland Pākehā team. Although they were named \"Auckland\" they have been renamed Auckland Pākehā as that is what they came to be known as from 1938 onwards in matches against Auckland Māori.\nAuckland v South Auckland (Waikato).\nAuckland played two matches on the same day against South Auckland (Waikato), and Taranaki. They won both matches. Neither was listed as an A or B team and both sides contained a large number of past, current, or future New Zealand international players. Former Ponsonby player, Kenneth Peckham who was now playing in the Waikato dislocated his right shoulder while playing for South Auckland and was taken to Auckland Hospital.\nAuckland v New Zealand Māori (Max Jaffe Cup).\nThe New Zealand Māori team was very similar to the one which had defeated Australia earlier in the season. The match was played as part of a Gala Day to raise money for injured players. George Nēpia traveled up from Gisborne to play in the match. Auckland was well below strength with several players out injured.\nAuckland Māori (Tamaki) representative season.\nIn addition to their loss to Auckland, the Auckland Māori side played in two other matches against Waikato Māori and North Auckland Māori.\nSenior grade registrations and transfers.\nAt North Shore Albions annual meeting on March 17 they stated that a number of new players were enrolled, including Ivor Stirling of Northland.\nAt the board of control meeting on April 14 the following senior registrations were approved, Transfers: Cliff Satherley from Richmond to Mount Albert; R.H.

        "title": "Pau Golf Club",
        "text": "The Pau Golf Club is one of the oldest golf clubs in the world. It is a private members-only club based in Pau, France.\nFounded by a group of Lord Hamilton, the colonels William Neilson Hutchinson and Lloyd-Anstruther, the major Pontifex, the archdeacon John Sapte and John Stewart. while the course was designed by Willie Dunn (golfer) and opened for play in 1856. The Pau Golf Club is the oldest club in continental Europe. It is also the third Golf Club built in the world outside of Great Britain, after those of Charleston (United States, 1786) Kolkata (India, 1829) and Mumbai (India, 1842).\nLocated in the heart of the city of Pau, the Pau Golf Club, with its 18-hole flat and technical course, is considered one of the most beautiful golf courses in France.\nHistory.\nIn the 17th century, during the reign of King Henry IV of France, bearnese people are known to have practiced the Jeu de mail on this site. The Billère plain at the gates of Pau, on the banks of the Gave de Pau, with the Pyrenees in the background, offered an idyllic setting.\nMoreover, this old bed of the Gave, with its very permeable rocky subsoil, allowed to avoid the affliction of mud, even in winter. An agreement was quickly negotiated with the local bearnese people to make the site available.\nTwenty years later, the same Scotsmen, wishing to rediscover their youthful memories, returned as tourists accompanied by a few friends, and always with their equipment.\nLittle by little, a whole English colony came to settle in Pau, profoundly impacting life in Pau during the Belle Époque, importing its customs, and its traditional sports, including horse riding (construction of the Pont-Long racecourse in 1842), hunting, Pyreneism, and of course golf.\nAfter the publication of Dr. Alexander Taylor's book \"On the curative influence of the climate of Pau and the mineral waters of the Pyrenees on diseases\", the region of Pau became a popular destination for the British aristocracy. Among them, members of Scottish and English golf clubs staying in Bearn. In 1856, Lord Hamilton, Colonels Hutchinson and Lloyd-Anstruther, Major Pontifex, Archdeacon Sapte and John Stewart rented farmland on the banks of the Gave de Pau and founded the Pau Golf Club.\nThe Pau Golf Club hired the first professional golfer in France, Joe Lloyd, in 1883.\nThe PGC remained the only golf club in France for more than 30 years, until the opening of the Biarritz Golf Club (Golf du Phare) in 1888. The Argelès-Gazost golf course was founded in 1890, but no longer exists today.\nThe Pau Golf Club was organized within the framework of Freemasonry, the founding members, winterers from Scotland and England during the Belle Epoque, were often Freemasons.\nThe club was initially run by a committee of nine to twelve members, the number of which varied from year to year, and the first two of which were renewable annually. Elected for a period of one year and eligible for re-election only after one year, the head of the committee was called the \"Captain\". It is only from 1909 onwards that the president will be able to (re)present himself every year.\nFounded by citizens of Her Majesty staying in Pau, the Pau Golf Club was then a club resolutely turned towards the British colony. Thus, the \"Captains\" elected since 1878 are traditionally British and the club remains fundamentally British until the Second World War. However, between 1907 and 1908, for a brief period, the Captain was French, in the person of Baron de Longueil.\nInitially, the British forbade the course to the local French people and to women.\nAt the end of World War I, many British tourists stopped visiting the city, and the golf course was saved by enthusiasts.\nThe end of the World War II marked the departure of the British colony. The number of members hardly exceeds 120 at the end of the occupation period.\nUnder the presidency of Maurice Liets, the 80's marked the discovery of golf by the French, and Pau did not escape this phenomenon.\nThe Pau Golf Club had more than five hundred members at the end of the 80s.\nThe club celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2005 in the presence of Jean Van de Velde, José María Olazábal, Severiano Ballesteros, while Colin Montgomerie ultimately could not join.\nFacilities and grounds.\nThe Club-house serves as a museum dedicated to the rich history of this club and the sport in Bearn.\nThe first course, designed by Willie Dunn, a professional player from Royal Blackheath, consisted of 9 holes, extended to 12 holes in 1860, then to 18 holes in 1875. In 1877, a 9-hole course was added for Ladies who did not have access to the men's course.\nThe course is today a par 69 installed along the gave de Pau. The course is flat with small greens.\nMembership.\nThe Pau Golf Club is a private club, open to its 650 members, their guests and visiting players."

        "text": "The 1938–39 Duquesne Dukes men's ice hockey season was the 2nd season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nHot on the heels of a successful first season, Duquesne's second campaign began with good news as several non-conference programs expressed interest in coming to Pittsburgh and playing the Dukes. At the beginning of the season the two divisions codified a single set of rules where the three regulation periods would run for 12 minutes. Last season, games at Duquesne Gardens had 15-minute sessions while the ones at the Cleveland Arena went for 10 minutes. The practical reason for this was because all league teams shared two homes rinks. Since multiple games needed to be played on the same day, Penn-Ohio League games had to be shorter than those played by the rest of the college hockey world.\nDuquesne began well, winning their first two-game before meeting Pittsburgh in early December. The Panthers were fast becoming Duquesne's biggest rival and the Blue and Gold handed the Dukes their first loss of the season. Duquesne rebounded in the next game with a stellar effort against Carnegie Tech, outshooting the Skibos 30–5 in 36 minutes, but were only able to get one goal past the Tartan netminder. An even bigger win followed when the Dukes handed John Carroll only its second loss since the start of last season. To this point Duquesne was the only team that was able halt the juggernaut Blue Streak team. After the Dukes shutout JCU for a second time, they set up a showdown with Pitt that could very well decide the league championship. Duquesne won the rematch 2–0 to place them above the Panthers in the standings and then followed that up with several weeks off.\nAfter examinations, the team resumed their schedule with a new addition to the team. Dick Scully, a small but talented player, had passed his exams and was now eligible to play on the varsity team. He spent a few games getting used to his new teammates and then starred by scoring all three goals in the team's victory over Pitt on February 14. The win all but handed the east division to the Dukes and the team followed that up by taking the next three games all by a wide margin. The Dukes ended their regular season against Pitt and the two teams fought a bitter battle for about 20 minutes. In the later half of the second period, Bill Vance tied the game at 2–2 on a goal that Pittsburgh vehemently protested against. When the goal was allowed to stand, Pitt coach Jack McSorley took his team off the ice and abandoned the game. As a result, the Panthers were charged with a forfeit and Duquesne was handed their 15th win of the season. The Dukes finished out as the regular season league champion after two more wins and entered the playoffs with a change to avenge last seasons' defeat.\nThe playoff format had been changed from a total-goal series to one where two wins were required. Duquesne won their first game against Pitt 3–2 and then followed that up with a 1–1 tie. The tie stood due to the rink schedule and didn't help either squad get closer to a victory. By the third game, Pitt began to take over and tied the series, sending the two to a fourth match where Duquesne was knocked out of the tournament. The Dukes would never get the chance to repay Pitt for the loss before the Panthers ended their program before the start of the following season.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Penn-Ohio League Playoffs"

A total of 41 players from 36 nations actually competed at the tournament.\nViktor Axelsen of Denmark won his first Olympic gold, defeating defending Olympic champion Chen Long from China. He became the first non-Asian — specifically Danish — to win Olympic badminton men's singles since Poul-Erik Høyer Larsen in 1996. Anthony Sinisuka Ginting of Indonesia won bronze by defeating four-time Olympian Kevin Cordón of Guatemala. He became the first Youth Olympic badminton medalist to win a medal at the Olympics, having also won bronze in 2014.\nBackground.\nThis was the 8th appearance of the event as a full medal event. Badminton was introduced as a demonstration sport in 1972, held again as an exhibition sport in 1988, and added to the full programme in 1992; the men's singles tournament had been held since.\nThe reigning champion was Chen Long of China, who also won bronze in 2012. 2016 bronze medalist Viktor Axelsen of Denmark also qualified. The top-ranked qualifier was Kento Momota of Japan who was also the reigning world champion.\nQualification.\nThe badminton qualification system was designed to ensure that 86 men and 86 women receive quota spots; the size of the men's singles field adjusts to hit that target quota. Following revisions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the qualifying periods were set on 29 April 2019 to 15 March 2020 and 4 January to 13 June 2021, with the ranking list of 15 June 2021 deciding qualification.\nThere were 38 initial quota places for the men's singles: 34 from the ranking list, 3 from Tripartite Commission invitations, and 1 host nation place. Nations with multiple players in the top 16 of the ranking list could earn 2 quota places; all others were limited to 1. Players were taken from the ranking list in order, respecting the national limits, until the places were filled. Each continent was guaranteed one spot, either through the invitational spots or by replacing the lowest-ranked player if necessary. The host nation spot was unused since Japan qualified two players through the ranking list and was reallocated to the ranking list.\nAdditional places beyond 38 were added where players qualified in both the men's singles and one of the doubles events. This resulted in 3 additional places added to the ranking list. One place was also given to a member of the Refugee Team, Aram Mahmoud. The total of qualified players was thus 42.\nCompetition format.\nThe tournament started with a group phase round-robin followed by a knockout stage. For the group stage, the players were divided into between 12 and 16 groups of between 3 and 4 players each. Each group played a round-robin. The top player in each group advanced to the knockout rounds. The knockout stage was a four-round single elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. If there were fewer than 16 groups in the group stage, some players received a bye in the round of 16.\nMatches were played best-of-three games. Each game was played to 21, except that a player must win by 2 unless the score reaches 30–29.\nSchedule.\nThe tournament was held over a 10-day period, with 9 competition days and 1 open day.\nSeeds.\nA total of 14 players were given seeds.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage was played from 24 to 28 July. The winner of each group advanced to the knockout rounds.\nFinals.\nThe knockout stage was played from 29 July to 2 August. One round was held per day, with a day off on 30 July.

The body was accorded observer status with the RLEF in March 2017, and affiliate status in March 2018. Due to the Hellenic Federation holding government recognition via its integration with the Hellenic Federation of Modern Pentathlon, any matches held under the GRLA were \"de facto\" illegal under Greek law. \nIn August 2022 the GRLA was finally recognised as the official body for the sport from the Greek state and received the national federation status. This recognition brought to an end the situation where the national team played 'home' fixtures abroad or in secret. The first international home game of the national team (women) took place in October 2022 at Gorytsa Park field, Aspropyrgos."

        "title": "1940–41 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1940–41 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season was the 4th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, there was optimism both inside and out for the program as coach Heyliger's first recruiting class was ready to join the varsity club. The team's schedule was expanded to more than 20 games and included some of the best college teams in North America. New members for the Illini had brought a tremendous amount of speed, including out-of-state students like Amo Bessone (Massachusetts) and Norbert Sterle (Minnesota).\nThe team got an early start on the season, with their first game coming on the 9th against Western Ontario. The game began with just two returning players in the starting lineup (Gillan and team captain Ziemba) while a trio of sophomores from the Boston-area were arrayed at forward. Despite experience being heavily favored towards Western, Illinois skated rings around their opponents and won the season opener 9–4. 1,800 fans showed up to see the new-look Illini and they weren't disappointed; both offensive lines were impressive and the defense looked much improved from the previous three seasons.\nThe team got some practice time in before they headed on a barnstorming tour of the pacific coast during the Christmas break. Over a 15-day period the team had 7 games scheduled and would participate in the first tournament in program history. The team opened their trip against Santa Rosa Junior College (a team made entire of Canadian players) with their two Minnesotans, Palazzari and Sterle, combining for 4 goals and 6 assists. After downing California in the second game they took on the powerhouse USC team and fell 0–1, finishing as tournament runners-up. A couple days later the two met for a rematch and Illinois was handed its second loss on the season, again by a 1-goal margin, but the team finished out its California stay with a win over UCLA. After watching the Rose Parade, the team made their way back to Champaign with a stop over in Colorado Springs. There the Illini took two games in convincing fashion from Colorado College and finished out their holiday excursion with a 5–2 record.\nIllinois opened their Big Ten schedule against defending-champion Minnesota but lineup changes for both teams resulted in a more even playing field. Illinois' defense was up to the task despite allowing a goal early in the game. Jack Gillen stopped 28 shots and allowed the Illini to produce a 2–1 lead in the third period. Just when it looked like the team would be able to defeat the Gophers, the Maroons tied the score with less than two minutes left and escaped with a tie. Over 2,000 spectators were hoping for a goal in overtime but none were forthcoming. The game demonstrated that Illinois had caught up to the class of the Midwest and proved it the following night with a 4–1 win, the first in eleven games between the two.\nAfter returning from the semester break, Heyliger's team found themselves shorthanded. The team lost the services of Chuck Mettler due to graduation and Wayne McKibbin due to withdrawal. Joe Gannon and Amo Bessone were suffering from colds and, if that weren't enough, Starr Owen and Aldo Palazzari had been ruled ineligible. A bit of a silver lining came in the series against Michigan Tech since eligibility rules were not in effect until the next semester began. With Owen and Palazzari in the lineup, but Gannon missing from the flu, Illinois headed up to Houghton for the first two games and dominated the Huskies. Despite having just 10 players on hand, the Illini overpowered MTU 7–1 in the first game. Tech didn't take that lying down and recovered for a tremendous effort in the next game. Illinois had to twice overcome deficits and eventually won the match 6–4. A return series was held a week later with the team looking much more itself. Owen managed to pass a special exam and was once again eligible to play. He proved his worth with a 5-point night but it was Norbert Sterle who was the star of the game; in the team's 10–2 win, Sterle scored 4 times and assisted on 4 others to set a new program record.\nThe next week the Illini travelled to Minnesota for a showdown between the Midwest's two best teams. With Illinois holding the advantage, the Gophers would have to win the series to pull ahead in the rankings. The first game was a hard-fought affair with 10 penalties being called on the Illini (5 to Bessone) but the teams remained within one goal of each other all through regulation. Sterle assisted on all three of Illinois' goals but Minnesota came up with the same amount and the two headed into their second overtime game of the year. Sterle assisted on two more Illini goals in the extra session and, while the Gophers scored in the second half of overtime, they couldn't even the score and fell to Illinois 5–4. The win guaranteed Illinois a winning record against Minnesota and, even after dropping the second game, the Illini had a championship in their sights.\nAfter an easy contest against Brantford Athletic Club, the team took a week off before taking on Michigan to end the year. The Wolverines were in the middle of a horrible season, possessing a 2–10–1 record to that point and the Illini took full advantage of their weakened opponent. Heyliger made changes to his lineup, including a familiar face in Howie Kopel. Even without the normal roster, IU dominated Michigan 7–1 and allowed just 13 shots on goal. With Gillan back in goal for the second game, the team easily defeated the Maize and Blue. Sterle set yet another program record with a 5-goal game (and added 2 assists), breaking the Big Ten scoring record with 19 points in conference games.\nWith the Championship nearly in their grasp, Illinois lost two players for the first game of the return series against Michigan; captain Ziemba was out with a sprained ankle and Bessone had to return home to Springfield, Massachusetts due to an illness in the family. With Owen and Gil Priestly filling in on defense, the team wasn't quite as good as they had been the week before but the team managed to earn no less than a share of the Championship with a 4–2 win while Sterle padded his total with 2 more points. A day off between matches allowed both defenders to return for the final game and Illinois captured the title outright with a 4–1 victory.\nIllinois had become Western Intercollegiate Champions in just 4 seasons, made even more amazing because, until this season, the Illini had just one win against another varsity team in three seasons of play. With most of their principle players still just sophomores, the team was expected to compete for the championship in each of the next two seasons at least but circumstances would change drastically at the beginning of the next year.\nNorbert Sterle, who finished the year with 65 points in 21 games (3.10 points per game) set a modern intercollegiate record for points in a season (since broken). His efforts throughout the year were so spectacular that, rather than continue with the Illini, he turned professional with the Kansas City Americans and spent a month with the Chicago Blackhawks (but didn't appear in any games). Sterle didn't play professional hockey for very long, however. After the United States entered World War II, Sterle enlisted and was commissioned as a Lieutenant. He was killed in action on November 19, 1943.\nBill Kerwin served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | California Invitational Tournament"

It is historically one of the most successful clubs in the country.\nHistory.\nThe field hockey section was established as a section of the club on July 26, 1923, and was founded by some of the former players of the disintegrating \"Argon\" Middle School Club. Already in the year of its establishment, the section played several games, and in 1924 the Warta team played in Sopot with the local Zoppoter Tennis Club and in Gdańsk with the Danziger Hockey Club, losing and drawing. In 1925, Warta played two matches in Warsaw with Warszawskie Towarzystwo Łyżwiarskie (Warsaw Skating Society), recording 6-0 and 11-2 victories. It is difficult to say what happened back then, but in 1926, work in the section ceases activity, and in 1927, the management decided to dissolve it.\nIn Poznań at the time there were excellent conditions for practicing this discipline, which resulted in the establishment of the Polish Field Hockey Association in 1926.\nIn 1929, on the initiative of E. Poszwa and L. Kędzis, the field hockey section was reactivated, but it is one of the winter sports divisions. On January 1, 1930, the section is seriously strengthened thanks to the merger with the Poznań Skating Club (it had the oldest field hockey section in Poznań). In the same year, Warta wins the award of the Municipal Committee for Physical Education and Military Training, defeating the then Polish champion - Lechia Poznań and the vice-champion - Czarni Poznań. \nIn 2015 the club was surprisingly relegated from the top division."

        "text": "WKS Grunwald Poznań is a Polish field hockey club, a section of the wider multi-sports club, from Poznań. It is historically one of the most successful clubs in the country and regularly competes in European competitions.\nHistory.\nThe section traces its roots to inter-war military club WKS Poznań, champions of Poland in 1935, 1936 and 1938. However the courts have decided that these titles are not formally recognised as belonging to WKS Grunwald.\nThe section was created in January 1952. At the turn of 1951/1952, the Board of the Union Sports Club Włókniarz Poznań (third place in the Polish Championships in 1950) made a proposal to the Board of the Garrison Military Sports Club (GWKS) Poznań to take over the field and ice hockey sections, which it itself was unable to maintain. The management of GWKS agreed and the section was officially taken over.\nThe team is one of the most successful teams of all time. Since the early 90s they were regulars in European competitions. Domestically they dominated the 2010s adding several titles to their already large tally. They also dominated the indoor championships in equal measure. \nThe following decade also started with domination winning in 2020 and 2021.\nStadium.\nThe club plays its home games at the field hockey only Henryk Zielazka Stadium () in the Grunwald neighbourhood of Poznań next to the Polish Army base in the city. The stadium was renovated in 2016 and has stands which can hold up to 3000 people. It was named in 2017 after a local prominent field hockey activist."

        "title": "1942–43 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1942–43 Illinois Fighting Illini men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nThere were high hopes for the team entering the season, but the Illini had several hurdles to yet overcome. The primary concern was the lack of players available for the squad; both academic ineligibility and the draft board had cut Illinois' roster down and the team only had a few alternates left. There was hope that, due to the war, the Big Ten would alter its rules and permit freshman to play varsity sports. Illinois would be well placed to take advantage as the freshman team looked as good, if not better, than the initial varsity lineup. A positive sign for the team was Minnesota agreeing to play Illinois once more and they were included on the program's 15-game schedule. Unfortunately, the Big ten punted on ruling for or against freshman, which left the team with few players.\nIllinois began its season against the Chicago Hornets, an amateur club, with just 7 players on the team. Lou Ferronti was missing due to his draft status but the team had received a boon with team captain Amo Bessone obtaining a deferment and being able to finish out his college career. Despite firing more than 50 shots on goal, Illinois lost the first game of the season but the team did demonstrate that they had enough conditioning to last for an entire contest. Entering the series against Minnesota, the team got another player as Bill Prentiss returned from a broken collarbone. So anticipated was the meeting that all 2,700 seats for both games were sold out in advance. Disaster stuck the team after the Gophers had arrived; Rolle was out with a mild concussion, Austin had come down with the flu and Prentiss' injury, which hadn't completely healed, was acting up. The two games were cancelled and the following series with Michigan Tech was in jeopardy.\nAfter a meeting between coach Vic Heyliger and AD Doug Mills, it was decided to cancel all games for the remainder of the semester but to resume after examinations. The plan came into place with the knowledge that several players could become eligible for the team in the spring session. Heyliger sent word of his program's decision to Minnesota's coach Larry Armstrong, offering to forfeit the two matches.\nWhen the team finally got to play their next game, they received good news as Bessone and Henry Coupe passed special examinations to remain eligible. The squad, which were tabbed 'Friday's Children' (in the nursery rhyme Monday's Child, the descriptors for Wednesday and Friday had been swapped), had already gone through a tumultuous season and had played just one game so far. The team sent 9 men to Minneapolis, having added Coupe and Wes Tregoning in the interim while losing Prentiss to academic ineligibility. In their first game in two months, Illinois played well, limiting the Gophers to two goals, but the Illini were limited offensively and lost the game 1–2. Worse, Bessone was injured in the game and there was a chance he wouldn't be ready for the rematch the next night. Bessone ended up starting and the team shot out of the gate, scoring 2 goals in the first. Bessone, however, was ejected for fighting just 7 minutes into the game and the team, which was already short-handed, had to play without any reserves for the remainder of the match. Several players, particularly Tom Twitchell and George Balestri, turned in outstanding performances and held off the Gophers to earn a 2–1 win. Bessone's injury was later confirmed to be a broken jaw.\nThe following weekend the team took on Michigan Tech. Bessone had had surgery to repair the three fractures and was set on playing while Twitchell had received his orders and would be playing his final games. Bessone and Karakas starred in the two games as MTU was defeated twice and Illinois looked to be succeeding despite all of their difficulties.\nBefore their series with Michigan, Illinois received word that Minnesota would not count the January games as forfeits. Because of this, the Illini still had a chance to win the Big Ten championship. Good news finally happened with Prentiss as he was able to pass a special exam and was in the lineup for the first time all season. The first game against the Wolverines was Henry Coupe's coming out party. He had been switched to center and responded with a 5-point night. Their huge win emboldened the Illini for the second game and the team fired 66 shots on goal. Michigan did well to allow only 4 goals against but it was more than enough to grant UI a second shutout.\nA week later the team headed to Ann Arbor, needing to win both games to capture the Big Ten title. While there had been a good deal of animosity between Illinois and Minnesota over the past few seasons, the Illini credited the Gophers and Armstrong with not taking advantage of their misfortune earlier in the year. Bessone led the charge with a 4-assist game to put the team within 1 win of a title and then Coupe responded with a 4-point game to sweep the Wolverines and earn Illinois its third consecutive championship. Tommy Karakas set a modern-day record with his 4th consecutive shutout.\nIllinois wrapped up their season with a two-game homestand against Tech. The two teams were more evenly matched and the Illini had to fight hard to win in both contests. Captain Bessone scored the final goal in his last home game, breaking a 4-4 tie with less than 5 minutes to play. The final game of the year was a rematch with the Chicago Hornets. Illinois avenged their early-season loss with the 10th win on the year, capping off an outstanding campaign.\nAfter the season, Illinois followed most other varsity programs and suspended operations. Despite the team's huge success, the program was never restarted after the war and remains a club team (as of 2021).\nSam Wylie served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1929–30 Marquette Hilltoppers men's ice hockey season was the 8th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nAfter coming up short the previous year, Marquette did not shy away from a challenge and put together the toughest schedule the team had yet undertaken. The Hilltoppers began with a tour of northern Michigan and Minnesota, playing two junior colleges during that time (they were members of the NIHA so the games counted in league standings). The team got a hard fight in the second half of their road trip but managed to hand Virginia Junior College its first loss of the season, having been 5–0 coming into the game. When the team returned home they took on Janesville A.C. and coach Iverson gave increased playing time to some of the newer player. Furlong and Moore responded with good performances, meaning that the team may be able to stay in the upper echelon of their division after the Two Macs graduated. In the drubbing of Janesville, despite not starting the match, MacKenzie and McFadyen each scored four goals.\nWith the team having steeled back in Milwaukee, they welcomed in Minnesota for a tough series. The team pulled out a narrow win in the first game but the second was delayed for a day due to soft ice. After a cold night the teams finished off the series with Marquette laying into the Gophers with a 5–1 victory. The win not only had the Hilltoppers atop the league standings, but gave Minnesota their fourth consecutive loss and fifth overall, meaning it would be impossible for the Gophers to challenge for the Intercollegiate title this season. Marquette finished up their home schedule with a pair of wins while Moore and Furlong both continued to show improvement.\nThe Hilltoppers hit the road for the remainder of the season. First the team stopped off in Ann Arbor at the end of January but could only manage a split against the Wolverines. This was the first win for Michigan over Marquette but with the Hilltoppers' lead in the standings they could absorb the loss. A few days later the team met Harvard, playing an eastern team for the first time in program history, and produced a surprising result. The Blue and Gold played a nearly perfect game, coming away with a victory over the perennial power (who were in contention for the eastern crown themselves) \"Porky\" Furlong had his best game to date, scoring twice to push Marquette over the top and leaving little doubt that the western clubs deserved to be on equal footing with the traditional powers of the east. After downing Army, Marquette took on the best team in the nation and produced one of the most memorable games in the history of the program. Yale entered the game 12–0 and Marquette set about trying to dent the Bulldogs for the first time on the year. Owing to the skill of the Elis, Marquette used three defensive players at a time rather than the standard two, this was caused as much by Yale's offense as the fact that no one on the team could keep up with McFadyen and MacKenzie when the Macs were skating at full tilt. The plan did not seem to work at the start as Yale came away with a 2–0 lead after the first period. Marquette began to climb back in the second; the Macs alternated goals with Yale and cut the lead to one at the start of the third. The two teams fought hard but Marquette's long road trip began to wear on the team and Yale scored its fifth goal with less than four minutes to play. The Hilltoppers knew they were swamped; the Elis surged in the final few minutes, scoring three more times before the clock read '0' and turning a very tight game into a rout.\nEven with the loss to Yale, Marquette had acquitted themselves well against the east and took a few weeks off before their final series with Minnesota. When the two met at the beginning of March, Marquette was so far ahead in the standings that they had already sewn up the western championship but the two were not going to let that stop them, the teams still had a great deal of pride. The Hilltoppers split the series with the Gophers, ensuring that they had a winning record against all major competition and earned their second league championship in three seasons. The games would be the last two coached between the brothers Iverson as Emil, the Minnesota coach, had announced his resignation in February. After the season, Kay following his brother's example and resigned as the Hilltoppers' bench boss. The loss compounded the difficulties that were sure to result from losing MacKenzie and McFadyen to graduation but, unfortunately, worse was to come for the Blue and Gold as circumstances beyond their control would soon threaten the existence of the program.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

A very mild winter left the Hilltoppers with essentially no ice prior to their first slate of games during the Christmas holiday. The team was led by Harold McFadyen and showed great improvement during their trek through Northern Michigan and Minnesota. After the team culminated their 4-game trip with a 14–2 win, they returned home, ready to continue their 22-game schedule. Unfortunately, the warm weather had not abated and Marquette was forced to remain idle for the entire month of January.\nIt wasn't until February that the Hilltoppers were able to play another game. The day before they were set to play, however, it was revealed that \"Yank\" McFadyen had earned too many credit hours and was no longer eligible to play. His role as captain was assumed by \"Porky\" Furlong. With their ice just barely serviceable, they welcomed Michigan Tech for a pair of games and won the series despite the layoff. Those games turned out to be the only home matches for the entire season and Marquette had to piece together the rest of their schedule on the fly. The Hilltoppers, who had built a reputation after winning two Intercollegiate titles in three years, played a game against the Poland National Team, who were gearing up for the 1932 Winter Olympics (they would place 4th of 4 teams) and performed well, losing the match 2–4. The next game for the team came on Big Cedar Lake against a local athletic club and the Hilltoppers showed that all it took was a few games to get them into shape.\nThe team ended its season with a pair of games against Michigan and, while the teams were essentially even in their play, the score of both games went to the Wolverines by a single goal. After the season Marquette lost its head coach, who was a football coach by trade, to Colorado Normal School. The Hilltoppers would have to contend with another new coach but the bigger concern was the lack of ice.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": " Mr Bowling Buys a Newspaper is a psychological thriller by Donald Henderson; it was the first novel Henderson published under his own name, and was first published in 1943.\nPlot summary.\nMr Bowling is a serial killer, and often buys newspapers after a murder in order to see if the death has been reported. He kills, however, not for mere pleasure, but because he hates living, wishes to be caught, and to be hanged. Nevertheless, after his last killing, he meets Alice, the love of his life whom he has always wanted to meet, who saves him with a false alibi. Alice, who is the daughter of a vicar and is religiously devout herself, rescues Bowling with forgiveness.\nPublication and reception.\nFrom early youth Henderson had written novels and plays under various pseudonyms but it was with \"Mr Bowling Buys a Newspaper\" that he first published under his own name. The novel received considerable critical attention in wartime Britain, but received mixed reactions. Raymond Chandler described it as his favourite novel. By contrast, one member of the public wrote to Henderson's publishers, Constable &amp; Co, and described it as 'the last word in filth'.\nAlthough adapted a number of times, after Henderson's early death in 1947, it eventually became forgotten, as did his other works. Although the film rights were sold, no film was ever made. For many years out of print, \"Mr Bowling Buys a Newspaper\" was republished by Collins Crime Club in 2019, with an introduction by Martin Edwards."

        "text": "The 2022 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2022 Betfred World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 16 April to 2 May 2022 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England, the 46th consecutive year the World Snooker Championship was held at the venue. The 16th and final ranking event of the 2021–22 snooker season, the tournament was organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by sports betting company Betfred. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom by the BBC, in Europe (including the UK) by Eurosport, and elsewhere in the world by Matchroom Sport and other broadcasters. The total prize fund was £2,395,000, of which the winner received £500,000.\nQualifying rounds for the tournament took place from 4 to 13April 2022 at the English Institute of Sport, featuring 128 professional and invited amateur players. The main stage of the tournament featured 32 players: the top 16 players from the snooker world rankings and another 16 players from the qualifying rounds. Ashley Hugill, Jackson Page, and Hossein Vafaei were debutants at the Crucible, Vafaei being the first Iranian player to reach the main stage. Mark Selby was the defending champion, having won the 2021 final against Shaun Murphy. He lost to Yan Bingtao in a second-round match that produced the longest ever played at the Crucible, lasting 85 minutes.\nRonnie O'Sullivan equalled Steve Davis's record of 30 Crucible appearances. He reached a record 20th quarter-final and a record 13th semi-final before defeating Judd Trump in the final to equal Stephen Hendry's record of seven world titles. It was O'Sullivan's 39th ranking title and 21st Triple Crown title. Aged 46 years and 148 days, he became the oldest world champion in the sport's history, surpassing Ray Reardon, who was aged 45 years and 203 days when he won his last world title in 1978. O'Sullivan also broke Hendry's record of 70 wins at the Crucible, setting a new record of 74.\nNeil Robertson made a maximum break in his second-round match against Jack Lisowski, the fifth of his career and the 12th time a 147 had been achieved at the Crucible. Graeme Dott also made a maximum break in his third-round qualifying match against Pang Junxu, the second of his career and the fifth time that a maximum had been made in the World Championship qualifiers. The main stage produced a record 109 century breaks, surpassing the 108 centuries made the preceding year. Mark Williams made 16 centuries during the event, equalling the record set by Hendry in 2002.\nBackground.\nThe first World Snooker Championship final took place in 1927 at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977 the tournament has been held annually at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The 2022 event marked the 46th consecutive year that the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 54th successive year that the World Championship was contested through the modern knockout format. Scottish player Stephen Hendry had been the most successful participant at the World Championship in the modern era, having won the title seven times. English player Mark Selby won his fourth world title at the 2021 championship, defeating compatriot Shaun Murphy 18–15 in the final, for which he received a £500,000 top prize from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. Organised by the World Snooker Tour, the 2022 tournament was sponsored by sports betting company Betfred, which sponsored the event from 2009 to 2012 and continuously since 2015.\nFormat.\nThe 2022 World Snooker Championship took place from 16April to 2May 2022, as the last of 16 ranking events in the 2021–22 season. The event featured a 32-player main draw, preceded by a 128-player qualifying tournament that was held at the English Institute of Sport between 4 and 13April 2022, finishing three days before the start of the main event. The qualifiers were played over four rounds, higher-ranked players being seeded and given byes to the later rounds. The first three qualifying rounds were played as the best of 11 , and the final round was played as the best of 19 frames.\nThe top 16 players in the latest snooker world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Defending champion Selby was automatically seeded first overall. The remaining 15 seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings, released after the 2022 Tour Championship. The 1991 champion John Parrott made the first-round draw for the Crucible on 14April at Betfred Studios in Salford, drawing the qualifiers at random against the seeded players. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as the best of 19 frames, second-round matches and quarter-finals played as the best of 25 frames, and the semi-finals as the best of 33 frames. The final was played over two days as a best-of-35-frames match.\nReaching the first round of the tournament's main stage were 12 players from England, six from Wales, four from Scotland, four from China, two from Thailand, and one each from Northern Ireland, Australia, Belgium, and Iran. It was the first time in the tournament's history that Iran was represented at the main stage. It was also the first time, since the tournament first featured 16 seeded players in 1980, that no seeded player from the United Kingdom was aged under 30. This occasioned debate about the increasing age profile of the UK's top players.\nThe tournament was broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC and Eurosport, and in Europe by Eurosport. Other international broadcasts were provided by Kuaishou, Migu, Huya Live, Youku, and CCTV in China; by NowTV in Hong Kong; and by DAZN in Canada, the United States, and Brazil. In territories where there was no other coverage, the event was broadcast by Matchroom Sport.\nPrize fund.\nThe winner of the event received £500,000 from a total prize fund of £2,395,000. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nA bonus of £40,000 was offered for a maximum break made at the Crucible, and £10,000 for a maximum made in the qualifying rounds. These bonuses were in addition to the £15,000 highest prize.\nSummary.\nQualifying.\nSeven-time champion Hendry, who had rejoined the professional tour in 2021 after nine years in retirement, chose not to enter the qualifiers for the 2022 tournament, stating that he had not been practising enough to be competitive. Liang Wenbo, seeded 32nd, would have entered the qualifiers in the third round but the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) suspended him from professional competition on 2April after he was convicted on a domestic assault charge.\nFirst qualification round.\nThe first qualifying round featured players seeded from 81 to 112 against unseeded players. Aged 15 years and 277 days, Welsh amateur Liam Davies set a new record as the youngest winner of a World Championship match by defeating Aaron Hill 6–4. Jimmy White, runner-up on six occasions, lost 2–6 to Andrew Pagett, although Pagett was criticised after footage showed him not declaring a . Marco Fu, a semi-finalist in 2006 and 2016, had not competed professionally since the 2020 Welsh Open due to a combination of vision problems and travel restrictions. While preparing for his return, he made a rare break exceeding 147 in a practice match against Noppon Saengkham, compiling a 149. He lost 5–6 to Ian Burns, who made a 141 break in the match. Four female playersReanne Evans, Rebecca Kenna, Ng On-yee, and Nutcharut Wongharuthaicompeted in the qualifiers, but all four lost in the first round. Ukrainian teenager Iulian Boiko, who had become the youngest player ever to compete in qualifying as a 14-year-old in 2020, defeated Michael Georgiou 6–4 to win his first World Championship match.\nSecond qualification round.\nThe second qualifying round featured players seeded from 49 to 80 against the first-round winners. Veteran player Dominic Dale defeated compatriot Duane Jones 6–3, a key win for Dale in his effort to stay on the professional tour. Allan Taylor defeated Michael Judge 6–5 on the final , a victory that helped Taylor remain on the tour through the one-year rankings. Nigel Bond, the 1995 runner-up, lost his place on the tour after a 1–6 defeat to Lukas Kleckers. Bond, the last player who turned professional in the 1980s to remain on the tour without an invitational tour card, subsequently announced his retirement after 33 seasons, commenting: \"At 56, my time as a main tour professional is at an end\". Bond stated that he would not attempt to regain his professional status through playing in Q School events, but would still compete in the World Seniors Championship, continue coaching, and serve the remainder of his term as a WPBSA Players Board director.\nSunny Akani, Andrew Higginson, Fergal O'Brien and Martin O'Donnell all lost their tour cards after defeats. Thepchaiya Un-Nooh, also in danger of relegation from the tour, beat Pagett 6–4 in a match that saw Pagett make three centuries and Un-Nooh make a 137 break. Matthew Stevens, runner-up in 2000 and 2005, boosted his chances of remaining on the tour by beating Gerard Greene 6–1. The 1997 champion Ken Doherty lost 4–6 to Rory McLeod.\nThird qualification round.\nThe third round of qualifying featured players seeded from 17 to 48 against the second-round winners. Five amateur players reached this stage: James Cahill, Liam Davies, David Lilley, Daniel Wells, and Michael White. Michael White defeated Mark King 6–1. Lilley, the reigning World Seniors Champion, defeated Kurt Maflin by the same score, which meant Maflin lost his place on the tour. The other amateurs did not progress. Dale received a walkover due to Liang's suspension, while Taylor achieved a surprise 6–4 win over 2013 semi-finalist and number 17 seed Ricky Walden, who had narrowly missed qualifying automatically for the Crucible after a semi-final loss in the Gibraltar Open. Scott Donaldson reached the last qualifying round by defeating Li Hang 6–5 on the final black ball, and Ashley Hugill came from 2–5 behind to defeat Martin Gould 6–5, despite suffering from food poisoning during the match.\nStephen Maguire, a semi-finalist in 2007 and 2012, played in the qualifiers for the first time since 2018 after falling to number 40 in the world rankings. He defeated Zhang Anda 6–3. Ding Junhui, the 2016 runner-up, played in the qualifiers after falling to 29th in the world rankings. He defeated his compatriot Tian Pengfei 6–4. David Gilbert, a 2019 semi-finalist, defeated McLeod 6–1, and Chris Wakelin defeated the European Masters champion Fan Zhengyi in a deciding frame. Kleckers lost his place on the tour after Matthew Selt beat him in a deciding frame; Michael Holt also lost his tour card following a 3–6 defeat to Tom Ford. Un-Nooh ensured that he would stay on the tour by defeating Jak Jones in a decider.\nThe 2006 champion Graeme Dott made a maximum break in the sixth frame of his 6–1 victory over Pang Junxu. His second maximum in professional competition, it came 23 years after his first at the 1999 British Open. It was the fifth time a maximum had been made in World Championship qualifying. Hossein Vafaei whitewashed Simon Lichtenberg 6–0 to reach the final qualifying round for the third time, and Jamie Clarke also secured a whitewash victory over 2019 semi-finalist Gary Wilson. The 2008 and 2012 runner-up Ali Carter defeated Gao Yang 6–4, and Stevens defeated Sam Craigie 6–1. The Welsh Open champion Joe Perry lost 3–6 to Jackson Page, who had regained his tour card through Q School after losing it the previous season.\nFourth qualification round.\nThe fourth and final round of qualifying, billed as \"Judgement Day\", was played on 12 and 13April and broadcast live on the World Snooker Tour's YouTube and Facebook channels. It comprised the 32 third-round winners facing each other in best-of-19-frame matches, all played over two sessions, with the 16 victors advancing to the main draw at the Crucible. Ding trailed Lilley 4–7 but won six frames in a row to reach the Crucible for a 16th consecutive year. Maguire reached the Crucible for a 19th consecutive time, defeating Zhou Yuelong 10–7 in a match he described as \"a dog fight from start to finish\". Hugill secured his Crucible debut by defeating Joe O'Connor 10–7, winning the final frame of the match by the deciding black the length of the table. Michael White, who had previously reached the Crucible three times as a professional, came from 6–7 behind to defeat Jordan Brown 10–8. He became only the second amateur to qualify for the Crucible, after Cahill in 2019.\nUn-Nooh trailed Selt 4–6, but won six of the last seven frames to secure a 10–7 victory, making back-to-back clearances of 138 and 145. Jamie Jones won the first seven frames against Ford and went on to clinch the match 10–5. Donaldson defeated Taylor 10–1, and Lyu Haotian defeated Dale 10–4 to reach the main draw for the third time. Vafaei took a 4–1 lead against Lei Peifan, but Lei levelled the scores at 5–5 and the match went to a deciding frame. Vafaei made a from 61 points behind to win on the final black and become the first Iranian player to reach the final stages of a World Championship.

Liam Highfield defeated Yuan Sijun 10–7 to reach the Crucible for a third time. Stevens lost the first four frames against Carter, but recovered to win 10–6 and reach the Crucible for an 18th time.\nClarke established an 8–4 lead over Dott, but the 2006 champion recovered to tie the scores at 8–8. In the 18th frame, Clarke got a on the final black to clinch a 10–8 victory. Wakelin took four of the last five frames against Jimmy Robertson to secure a 10–7 win, and Saengkham won the last three frames against Gibraltar Open winner Robert Milkins for a 10–8 victory. Six Welsh playersqualifiers Clarke, Jones, Page, Stevens, and Michael White, along with top-16 seed Mark Williamsreached the Crucible, the most since 1990.\nMain stage.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 16 and 21April as the best of 19 frames. Selby, who had withdrawn from the Turkish Masters and Gibraltar Open as he struggled with mental health issues, considered not defending his world title due to depression. He had not played competitively since his first-round loss at the Welsh Open, and practised relatively little before the tournament. He took an 8–3 lead over Jones but saw his lead reduced to two frames at 9–7. Selby clinched a 10–7 victory when Jones went in frame 17. Ronnie O'Sullivan, the world number one, equalled Steve Davis's record 30 Crucible appearances, having competed in the final stages of the tournament every year since the age of 17. He lost the first three frames against Gilbert, but then won six in a row to lead 6–3 after the first session. O'Sullivan won four consecutive frames in the second session to clinch the match 10–5 and equal Hendry's record of 70 Crucible victories. He was referred to the WPBSA's disciplinary committee after appearing to make a lewd gesture when he missed a black off the spot in the 13th frame. O'Sullivan subsequently denied the charges at a disciplinary hearing, but was fined £2,000 and ordered to pay a further £2,000 in costs relating to gestures made during televised matchplay at the tournament and at the 2021 UK Championship.\nZhao Xintong, who had won the first two ranking titles of his career earlier in the season, made his second Crucible appearance. Facing Clarke, he took a 7–2 lead in the first session and won all three frames played in the second session as he wrapped up his first Crucible win 10–2. He made two centuries and five more breaks over 70 in the match. Afterwards, Clarke called Zhao \"just phenomenal, a sensation in our sport\" and predicted that he would win the title within five years. Page led former runner-up Barry Hawkins 6–2, but Hawkins narrowed his deficit to one frame at 7–8 before Page made back-to-back total clearances of 128 and 135 to win 10–7. \"I couldn't have asked for a much better debut\", commented Page. The first seeded player to exit the tournament, Hawkins failed to reach the second round for the first time since 2010.\nMurphy and Maguire faced each other at the Crucible for the first time, Maguire establishing a 6–3 lead after the first session. Murphy began the second session with a 130 break, his 100th World Championship century, and reduced Maguire's lead to 7–6 at the mid-session interval. Commentating for the BBC, Doherty described the 14th frame as \"one of the craziest\" he had ever witnessed. Lasting 71 minutes, it included Maguire jokingly throwing his cue on the ground after losing position and Murphy discussing for four minutes the referee's decision to award him a , before refusing to accept it out of sportsmanship. Murphy eventually won the frame on the black to tie the scores, and made a half-century in the 15th to lead for the first time at 8–7, but Maguire won the last three frames to clinch a 10–8 victory. Anthony McGill, a semi-finalist in 2020, led Highfield 6–3 after the first session. Highfield reduced his deficit to one frame at 6–7, but McGill took three of the last four to win 10–7, helped by a fluke in the final frame. McGill stated that he had struggled in the match, acknowledging \"a lot of mistakes and missed pots\", but credited his victory to his strong safety play.\nThree-time champion Williams won the first seven frames against his compatriot Michael White, and wrapped up a 10–3 win in the second session, making four centuries in the match. \"I started off like a train, put Michael under pressure and didn't really ease up\", commented Williams. Mark Allen defeated Donaldson 10–6, but voiced his dissatisfaction with how the table had played. Neil Robertson trailed Hugill 1–3 but won eight consecutive frames on his way to a 10–5 victory, compiling four centuries in the match. Stuart Bingham, a semi-finalist the previous year, defeated Lyu 10–5 and made a 140 break in the match, the highest of the first round. Yan Bingtao, making his fourth Crucible appearance, compiled a century and seven half-centuries in his first session against Wakelin. He won five of the six frames played in the second session to clinch the match 10–6 and reach the second round for a third consecutive year. John Higgins made his 28th consecutive Crucible appearance. He trailed Un-Nooh 4–5 after the first session, but took six of the last eight frames to win 10–7 and reach the second round for an eighth consecutive time.\nJack Lisowski led Stevens 6–2, but Stevens recovered to tie the scores at 6–6. Lisowski won the next three frames to go 9–6 ahead and eventually won the match 10–8. Lisowski stated afterwards that he had been playing fearfully at the end because he was \"guarding the lead, which is the worst thing you can do\". The 2020 runner-up Kyren Wilson faced the 2016 runner-up Ding. Ding led 3–0 and 7–5, but Wilson went ahead at 8–7. Ding tied the scores at 8–8 but missed a pivotal pot on the final pink in the 17th frame as he attempted a clearance from 65 points behind. Wilson went on to win 10–8 and called the performance \"one of my best victories\". The match featured five centuries and 12 more breaks over 50. Before his match with Vafaei, 2019 champion Judd Trump stated that he had not been enjoying his snooker and did not have high expectations for the World Championship. The scores were tied at 3–3, but Trump won seven of the next eight frames for a 10–4 victory. Vafaei, who made a 121 break in the second session, called his Crucible debut \"a very big achievement for me and my country\". Luca Brecel faced Saengkham, whose wife had given birth to the couple's first child the day before the match began, three weeks earlier than expected. After winning six of the first seven frames, Saengkham went on to clinch a 10–5 victory and reach the second round for a second time. He revealed that he and his wife had named their newborn daughter Believe, stating that the name was inspired by Selby, who said \"believe, believe, believe\" while 4–10 down to Higgins in the 2017 final, before coming back to win the title.\nSecond round.\nThe second round of the event was played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, between 21 and 25April. Thirteen of the top sixteen seeds reached the second round, along with three qualifiers, Page, Maguire, and Saengkham. Williams faced his practice partner Page, a player he described as \"not just a friend, more like my fourth son\". The players had met once previously in professional competition at the 2020 Scottish Open, Williams winning 4–1 on that occasion. Williams won the first seven frames, and went on to complete a 13–3 victory, winning the match with a and reaching the quarter-finals for an 11th time. He compiled six centuries in the match, equalling the record for the most centuries in a best-of-25-frame match set by Selby in the 2011 event.\nMaguire faced Zhao, who played the first best-of-25-frame match of his professional career. Maguire took a 5–3 lead in the first session and extended it to 11–5 in the second session, which was briefly interrupted when a pigeon entered the arena and landed on the adjoining table where Yan was playing Selby. Maguire secured a 13–9 victory to reach the quarter-finals for a seventh time. Calling his form against Murphy \"rubbish\", he said that he had driven to Glasgow after his first-round match, borrowed a friend's cue, and practised with it to play Zhao. O'Sullivan faced Allen, who predicted that he would \"get under the skin\" of the world number one. O'Sullivan attempted a maximum break in the first frame but ran out of position after the tenth red and potted a pink, finishing on 87. O'Sullivan won five consecutive frames in the first session to lead 6–2. O'Sullivan attempted a maximum again in the second session, this time potting 11 reds and 11 blacks before losing position and missing a double on a red. He led 12–4 after the second session. The third session lasted just one frame as O'Sullivan wrapped up a 13–4 victory, setting records both for reaching a 20th quarter-final and for winning 71 matches at the Crucible.\nTied 4–4 with Selby after the first session, Yan took a 9–7 lead after the second session. In the third session, the 46-minute 18th frame hinged on a safety battle over the brown. Uncertain as to whether the cue ball would pass the blue to pot the brown, Yan studied the shot for several minutes before asking the referee to clean the cue ball, which referee Rob Spencer refused to do under the circumstances. Some commentators, including Jimmy White and Alan McManus, initially called Yan's request \"out of order\", but Yan later explained that it was a joke. Yan successfully made the shot to pot the brown and went on to win the frame for an 11–7 lead. Selby won the next three frames, reducing Yan's lead to one at 11–10. The penultimate frame of the match lasted 85 minutes, setting a new record for the longest frame ever played at the Crucible; the previous record had been 79 minutes in a 2019 first-round match between Brecel and Gary Wilson. Yan won the frame on the final black, and went on to win the match 13–10. Playing Bingham, Wilson attempted a maximum break in the second session, potting 12 reds and 12 blacks before missing the 13th red. Bingham made his own maximum break attempt in the third session, but ran out of position after the 13th red. Bingham, who won the match 13–9 to reach his fourth quarter-final, said it was on his \"bucket list\" to make a 147 at the Crucible.\nSaengkham and Higgins were tied at 4–4 after the first session, but Higgins won seven consecutive frames in the second session to lead 11–5. In the third session, with Higgins one frame from victory at 12–6, Saengkham attempted a maximum break but missed the last red, ending on 112. \"I'd have loved him to get it. You could see how fired up he was and I really thought he was going to do it\", stated Higgins. Higgins won the match 13–7 to reach his 16th quarter-final, putting him ahead of Steve Davis and Jimmy White, who had both reached 15 quarter-finals, and behind only Hendry and O'Sullivan, who had reached 19 and 20 respectively. Trump led McGill 10–6 after the second session. McGill won four of the next five frames, narrowing Trump's lead to one at 11–10. Trump won the next to move one frame from victory, but McGill closed the scores to 12–11, and was 30 points ahead in frame 24 when he missed a shot on a red with the rest. Trump won 13–11 to reach his ninth quarter-final; he called the final session of the match \"one of the best sessions I have been involved in\".\nLisowski led Robertson 9–7 after the first two sessions. In the 19th frame, Robertson made a maximum break, the fifth of his career and the 12th maximum in Crucible history. He became the eighth player, after Cliff Thorburn, Jimmy White, Hendry, O'Sullivan, Williams, Carter, and John Higgins, to make a maximum in the final stages of a World Championship. Robertson went 12–11 ahead and looked to be on the verge of victory when he made a 55 break in frame 24, but Lisowski produced a frame-winning clearance of 72 to force a decider. Both players had opportunities to win before Lisowski clinched the frame for a 13–12 victory. Lisowski said afterwards: \"I have never experienced anything like that in my life. The cheer when I potted the red that got me over the line in the decider… I am completely drained, I gave that literally everything I had and it has to be the best win of my career.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals of the event were played as the best of 25 frames, held over three sessions, on 26 and 27April. Maguire was the only qualifier to reach this stage; Yan and Lisowski both competed in the quarter-finals for the first time. O'Sullivan, Higgins, and Williams, collectively known as the Class of '92 having all turned professional in 1992, all reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2011. \"I think it's incredible that it's been 30 years and the three of us are better players than we've ever been\", Higgins stated.\nFacing Maguire, O'Sullivan won six consecutive frames in the first session to lead 6–2. He won another five consecutive frames in the second session, ending it with an 11–5 lead. O'Sullivan wrapped up a 13–5 victory within 20 minutes of the final session to reach a record 13th semi-final, breaking Hendry's previous record of 12. In his first session against Yan, Williams won four frames in a row after the mid-session interval to finish 6–2 ahead. Yan won six of the eight frames played in the second session, levelling the scores at 8–8. In the final session, Yan took a 10–8 lead, but Williams tied the scores at 10–10. Yan took advantage of several flukes to go 11–10 ahead, but Williams won the last three frames to clinch the match 13–11 and reach his seventh semi-final, becoming the oldest player to reach the final four since Ray Reardon in 1985. He stated afterwards: \"I am just so happy to get to the semi-finals. I am here 30 years on after turning pro and still trying my best... I am scoring as well as I have ever scored.\"\nHiggins led Lisowski 5–3 after the first session and 8–7 after the second. Higgins moved into an 11–9 lead in the final session, but Lisowski won three frames in a row to lead 12–11 before Higgins made a century break to force a deciding frame. Lisowski had the first chance in the decider but missed a red while on a break of 18. Higgins clinched victory with a 72 break, winning 13–12. Afterwards, Higgins said he was delighted to reach the semi-finals but did not think he deserved the win. Trump led Bingham 5–3 after the first session. Bingham won five consecutive frames in the second session to lead 8–5, before Trump recovered to tie the scores at 8–8. Trump took all five frames played in the final session to clinch a 13–8 victory. Trump noted the 14th frame as a turning point in the match: \"All of sudden, out of nowhere, Stuart missed a black off its spot and it gave me some confidence. I was completely gone at 8–5. I just tried to enjoy it and give my all.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals of the event were played as the best of 33 frames, held over four sessions, between 28 and 30April. For the first time at the Crucible, all four semi-finalists were former champions, O'Sullivan having won six previous titles, Higgins four, Williams three, and Trump one. All three members of the Class of '92 reached the semi-final stage for the first time since the 1999 event.\nTrump and Williams played each other for the first time in a Triple Crown tournament. Williams made errors throughout the first session and struggled with his long potting, as Trump won seven of the eight frames played to lead 7–1. Both players complained about the condition of the table, which was repaired during the interval. Steve Davis noted the contrast with Williams's strong performances in earlier rounds, saying: \"It is a shock that Mark Williams has gone off the boil. We expected him to continue his form.\" Afterwards, Williams apologised on Twitter for his poor play in the session. In the second session, Trump made back-to-back centuries to take a seven-frame lead at 9–2, but Williams responded with a 119 break to make his 13th century of the tournament, a new personal best in any tournament of his career. Both players won four frames in the session to leave Trump leading 11–5. Williams won six of the eight frames in the third session, reducing Trump's lead to 13–11 and receiving a standing ovation as he left the arena. Doherty commented: \"What a performance. The match between Judd Trump and Mark Williams is back on.\"\nIn the final session, Williams levelled the scores at 13–13 and 15–15. His 138 break in the 30th frame was his 16th century of the tournament, equalling Hendry's 2002 record for the highest number of centuries in a single year at the Crucible. Williams went ahead for the first time at 16–15, but Trump took the match to a deciding frame, before which the players received a standing ovation. Both players had chances to win, but Trump potted two of the last three reds with cross doubles and then took the final red with a black to win the frame and match. Trump commented that the win was \"once in a lifetime\", and that playing Williams was akin to playing a video game on \"hard mode\". The media praised the drama and quality of the match, calling it a \"thrilling Crucible clash\" and \"one of the great matches in Crucible history\". At the end of the year, the World Snooker Tour ranked the semi-final between Trump and Williams in second place on its \"Top Ten Matches of 2022\" list.\nO'Sullivan and Higgins met at the Crucible for a sixth time. Before the semi-final, O'Sullivan led their head-to-head 36–33, but Higgins had won five of their last six encounters. They had last met at the Crucible in the quarter-finals of the 2011 event, when Higgins won 13–10 en route to his fourth title. Both players struggled to find fluency at the outset, with O'Sullivan's average shot time exceeding 29 seconds in the first two frames. Higgins won the first three frames, but O'Sullivan levelled the scores at 4–4 after the first session. The scores were level again at 6–6 in the second session, but O'Sullivan then moved 9–6 ahead. In the final frame of the session, O'Sullivan was 51 points behind with 51 remaining on the table. After potting a red and black, he made a 43 clearance to force a re-spotted black, which he potted to take a 10–6 lead.\nO'Sullivan won five of the eight frames played in the third session, ending with a total clearance of 134, to extend his lead to 15–9. Higgins, whose 103 in the 21st frame was his only break over 70 in the match, slammed the butt of his cue on the floor in frustration after missing a red in the 23rd frame. The final session lasted four frames as O'Sullivan wrapped up a 17–11 win. Higgins stated afterwards that he was disappointed with how he had played, but praised his opponent: \"Ronnie was far too good for me. He was lethal. I don't think he missed one ball when he was in among them, he might have run out of position a few times, but other than that he was unbelievable.\"\nFinal.\nThe final of the event was played on 1 and 2 May 2022 as a best-of-35-frames match, held over four sessions, between O'Sullivan and Trump. Belgian referee Olivier Marteel took charge of his second World Championship final, having previously refereed the 2015 final between Bingham and Murphy. O'Sullivan was contesting his eighth World Championship final, having won six and lost one previously, and Trump was competing in his third final, having won one and lost one previously. The finalists had met once before at the Crucible, in the semi-finals of the 2013 event, when O'Sullivan defeated Trump 17–11. Trump stated before the match: \"It's always been a dream of mine to play Ronnie in the final.\"\nAfter Trump won the opening frame, O'Sullivan won the second with a 120 break, his 13th century of the tournament, equalling his previous personal best at the Crucible. In the fourth frame, O'Sullivan engaged in a three-minute discussion with the referee about the correct replacement of the cue ball after a miss had been called. O'Sullivan came from behind in the frame to force a re-spotted black, which he potted with a double off three cushions to lead 3–1. O'Sullivan went on to lead 5–1, making another century in the sixth frame. Trump won the last two frames of the session, reducing O'Sullivan's lead to 5–3. O'Sullivan and referee Marteel had several heated exchanges during the session and did not shake hands afterwards. Marteel issued a formal warning over a gesture O'Sullivan made near the end of the eighth frame after failing to escape from a snooker, but O'Sullivan denied any wrongdoing, later accusing the referee of \"looking for trouble\". Trump won the first frame of the second session, but O'Sullivan took seven of the next eight, capitalising on safety errors and missed pots by Trump to end 12–5 ahead, his largest overnight lead in any of the world finals he had played. O'Sullivan's 118 break in the 11th frame was his 15th century of the tournament, a new personal best in a single year at the Crucible. Speaking critically for the BBC, Murphy stated that Trump had \"made far too many mistakes\" and had \"a horrific night in front of him\" after the first day's play.\nTrump began the third session with his first century of the match, and went on to win six of the eight frames played, reducing O'Sullivan's lead to three at 14–11. It was the only session O'Sullivan lost in the tournament. In the final session, O'Sullivan won three of the first four frames with breaks of 82, 88, and 75 to go 17–12 ahead at the mid-session interval. Trump made a century to win the 30th frame, bringing the total number of Crucible centuries to 109, breaking the record of 108 achieved the previous year. However, O'Sullivan made an 85 in the 31st to win the match 18–13 and equal Hendry's record of seven world titles. Calling it \"probably the best result I've ever had\", O'Sullivan said the final had been \"a titanic battle against a strong competitor who is young and hungry\". Trump said he had \"made a fight of it against the best player of all time\" and called O'Sullivan's seventh world title \"an amazing achievement for him and for snooker\". The victory gave O'Sullivan his 39th ranking title and 21st Triple Crown title. Aged 46 years and 148 days, he became the oldest world champion in snooker history, surpassing Reardon, who was 45 years and 203 days old when he won his final title in 1978. O'Sullivan also set a new record for the most matches won at the Crucible, with 74, and ended the season as world number one. Writing for \"Snooker Scene\", editor Clive Everton praised these achievements by O'Sullivan, calling him \"snooker's answer to Tiger Woods in golf or Roger Federer in tennis\".\nThe last session of the final attracted a peak audience of 4.5million viewers on BBC Two, the highest figure since 2014 and a 17 per cent increase over the previous year. Overall, the event attracted a 30 per cent greater share of the BBC's viewing audience than the previous year. The event was Eurosport's best tournament on record in the UK, in terms of both average audience and market share. Eurosport also achieved record viewership figures in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Spain for the event.\nMain draw.\nThe numbers given in brackets after the players' names show their 2022 World Championship seedings.

The annual tournament determined the conference champion of the Division I Atlantic Coast Conference for college baseball. Duke will receive the league's automatic bid to the 2021 NCAA Division I baseball tournament after defeating NC State in the Championship game.\nThe tournament has been held every year but two since 1973, with Clemson winning ten championships, the most all-time. Georgia Tech has won nine championships, and Florida State has won eight titles since their entry into the league in 1992. Charter league member Duke, along with recent entrants Virginia Tech, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Louisville have never won the event.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe winner of each seven-team division and the top ten other teams based on conference winning percentage, regardless of division, from the conference's regular season were seeded one through twelve. Seeds one and two were awarded to the two division winners. Teams were then divided into four pools of three teams each, with the winners advancing to single elimination bracket for the championship.\nIf a 1–1 tie were to occur among all three teams in a pool, the highest seeded team will advance to the semifinals. Because of this, seeds 5–12 must win both pool play games to advance to the single-elimination bracket, and seeds 1–4 must only win the game against the first game winner. For example, if the 7 seed beats the 11 seed in the first game, then the winner of the 7 seed versus 2 seed advances to the semi-finals and the result of the 11 vs. 2 game would not determine further play.\nPool play is the official model of how the ACC tournament is played, but it can also be modeled as a single-elimination tournament. The tie-breaker described above is equivalent to a first round bye for the top four seeds. Seeds 5 through 12 play a first round game each, then the second round games between the first round winners and the top seeds determine who advances to the semi-finals. Games between the top seeds and the first round losers are also played but those are equivalent to consolation games that do not lead to further play.\nThe seeds were announced on May 22, after the conclusion of the regular season.\nSchedule and Results.\nSchedule.\nSource:\nAll–Tournament Team.\nSource:"

        "title": "Stan Webb (rugby league)",
        "text": "Stanley George Webb was a New Zealand international rugby league player who represented them 15 times in 1925 and 1926. Webb was the 177th player to represent New Zealand. He also played 10 matches for Auckland from 1922 to 1927. Webb played club rugby league for Devonport United for 7 seasons, 1 season for Ellerslie and 1 season for a combined Ellerslie-Otahuhu senior side.\nEarly life and family.\nStanley Webb was born on 28 November 1899. His mother was Agnes Webb (née McDonald) and his father was George Webb. His parents had married on 10 April 1893. He had 7 siblings; Norina Gladys Haydon (née Webb) (b.1893-1966), Clarence Christopher (b.1897-1968), Doris Thelma Eugene (b.1901-1979), Hilda Alexandra Jaggs (née Webb) (b.1903), Marjorie Jean (b.1905-1984), Donald (b.1910-1979), and Molly Isabel Lorraine (b.1914-1916). The family was living at 19 Stanley Street (Stanley Point Road) in Devonport when Stan's brother Clarence enlisted in World War I in 1918.\nPlaying career.\nNorth Shore Albions and Auckland debuts.\nIn 1918 Webb was playing in the fifth grade for the North Shore Albions club on the North Shore of Auckland. By the 1922 season Webb had progressed to the First Juniors team at the club, which was now known as Devonport United after a merger with the Sunnyside club in 1920. His brother Clarence was playing for the senior side and early in the season Stanley was promoted to join him in the top side. He debut was likely in a 18–7 win over the Fire Brigade side. During the season he played 13 matches for Devonport, scoring an impressive 11 tries which made him the 4th highest try scorer in senior competition matches. He combined with his brother for several of his tries but Clarence was dropped to a lower grade team mid season and broke his leg in a match at Māngere and was hospitalised.\nIn late July he was selected in the reserves for the Auckland side to play Cambridge. However he did take the field and kicked a conversion in a 73-29 thrashing of Cambridge at Carlaw Park. Later in the season on 2 September, Webb again played for Auckland, this time against South Auckland at Carlaw Park. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup and the visitors upset Auckland 21–20 to claim the trophy. Webb had begun the match in the three quarters but was replaced by George Yardley at halftime.\nIn 1923 Stan played 14 matches for Devonport and scored 5 tries and kicked 5 conversions. They finished mid table in the first grade championship and were knocked out in the semi-finals of the Roope Rooster competition by City Rovers. A week later on 15 September he played his only representative match of the season for Auckland against South Auckland. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup and the match was drawn 20–20 at Steele Park in Hamilton with Webb scoring 1 try.\nThe 1924 season saw Webb “out of town” to begin the year. He had returned to Auckland weeks later and made his first appearance in a 2–2 draw against City Rovers in a round 3 match on 10 May. he ultimately played 13 matches for Devonport and scored 4 tries and kicked 1 conversion. After 17 rounds of the first grade championship Marist Old Boys trailed Devonport by 2 competition points. Marist had played one less match and so the Auckland Rugby League scheduled a final between the two sides to decide the championship. An enormous crowd of 17,000, believed to be a club record at the time was on hand at Carlaw Park to see Marist win 20–17. Marist won with a try in the last minute to Malloy with Jack Kirwan debuting for them. Earlier in the game Webb put Bert Laing away from a scrum and a try for Harper eventuated to give Devonport a 7–5 lead. In the second half Webb was involved in a break with Douglas and Laing with Laing scoring putting Devonport out to a 17–12 lead. Devonport had a revenge of sorts when they knocked Marist out of the Roope Rooster competition a week later with a 5-3 round 2 win however they then lost their semi final match with Ponsonby United 14–10 to end their season.\nNew Zealand selection for tour of Australia.\nWebb began the year playing for Devonport once more and he played 8 matches, scoring 4 tries and kicking 1 conversion. Then following a trial match for Auckland A against Auckland B which was lost 5-0 Webb was picked as one of the halfbacks for the New Zealand tour of Australia. The Auckland Star was somewhat unflattering with their comments on his selection. They said he “may not be the big success many believe. He will work hard and shirk nothing, but, as remarked elsewhere, Auckland has no really brilliant half-backs, and Webb has found a place in a weak year”. Prior to their departure the Devonport club held a “social and dance” in Webb, Bert Laing, and Horace Dixon’s honour (the other selected members from the club). Webb’s debut for New Zealand actually came prior to the team’s departure for Australia. A match was arranged at Carlaw Park between Auckland and the New Zealand side. Webb scored a try in a 16-9 win for New Zealand. His try came from a scrum near the Auckland line where he dived over in the corner which had given New Zealand a 8-3 lead.\nNew Zealand departed for Sydney on 3 July on board the Moeraki. Webb made 6 appearances on the tour with 5 at halfback and 1 against New South Wales late in the tour at centre. He played in the opening match of the tour against New South Wales on 11 July at the Sydney Cricket Ground. New Zealand lost before a crowd of 24,000 by 7 points to 4. Webb was playing alongside his Devonport clubmate Bert Laing who was captaining the side in the standoff position. New Zealand were said to be the better side but wasted several scoring chances through poor handling. It was said surprisingly that Laing and Webb “had no understanding” with each other with Laing's handling being slow and bad. Webb “still has the old mode of putting the ball in the scrum, throwing downward. The recognised style here now… is for the ball to be slung in almost horizontally or delivered at least lower than the knee”. Webb then played against the Australian Universities side at the Sydney Sports Ground before 2,500 spectators. New Zealand lost 15–13 with Webb scoring New Zealand's last try which failed to be converted by Craddock Dufty thus costing New Zealand a chance of a draw. Earlier he had sent a smart pass to Maurice Wetherill who scored New Zealand's first try which was converted by Neil Mouat to give New Zealand a 5–0 lead. Webb was replaced at halfback for the 3rd tour match against Newcastle by Wilson Hall with The New Zealand Herald reporting “Webb played a fine game at halfback against New South Wales, and it is hard to understand why Wilson-Hall is selected instead of him”. Webb missed selection for 2 further matches against New South Wales before returning to the side for their 6th tour match against Far North Coast on 29 July. The match was played in Lismore before 5,000 spectators. New Zealand won 21–20. He was said to be “smart at clearing the ball from the scrums”. On 5 August he played against Ipswich on North Ipswich Reserve with New Zealand losing 22–21. He helped set up a try for Frank Henry when he passed the ball to him ten yards out and he crossed for a try which Craddock Dufty converted to narrow the score to 14–13 to Ipswich. The Brisbane Courier reported that Webb “is a new player, who is very tricky and speedy” and that he was “the finest of the inside backs. He was always dangerous, and took slices out of the defence by pace and trickiness when he was given the slightest chance”. Webb was not selected for the next 2 matches but was chosen to play centre against New South Wales on 15 August. New Zealand won the match 19–18 at the Sydney Cricket Ground before 16,000 spectators. In the first half Wetherill was playing behind the scrum but in the second Webb moved into the half back position. He scored New Zealand's final try after Mouatt passed to him during “loose play” and Webb “scored easily”. The try was converted by Mouatt giving New Zealand a 19–13 lead which they hung on to. In the final match of the tour Webb moved back into the half back position for New Zealand's 26–25 loss to the Southern Division at Fisher Park in Cootamundra. New Zealand had travelled 253 miles over night by train to reach the venue. New Zealand was on the wrong end of a 28-3 penalty count with several of the Southern Division's points coming from penalty shots at goal. Webb crossed for a try in the second half after gathering the ball and “dummied several opponents, and scored near the posts”. After the conversion New Zealand led 25 to 12.\nFollowing the teams return to New Zealand Webb played in the Auckland sides 18–18 draw with the touring Queensland side. Webb scored a try after “whipping up the ball [and] struggled over the line” to make the score 8–5 to Queensland. During the second half Webb moved to the centre position with Frank Delgrosso shifting to half back. Webb then played for New Zealand against Queensland on 12 September before 14,000 at Carlaw Park. New Zealand was soundly beaten 35-14 though Webb was said to have played well and was involved in several attacking incidents.\n1926-27 New Zealand tour of England and Wales.\nWebb began the 1926 season playing for Devonport once more however in his very first game of the season against Ponsonby United he badly injured his ankle and couldn't play for 3 weeks. He returned to the field on 5 June in a match against City Rovers. Near the end of the month he was selected for an Auckland trial match between A and B teams which was a curtain-raiser to the North Island – South Island match. His Auckland B team won 25–16. 4 days later he played for Auckland against the Rest of New Zealand. The Rest of New Zealand won 28–21 with Webb scoring a try for Auckland. After this match the New Zealand selectors named him in the touring side for England and Wales in the five-eighths position along with Jack Kirwan, Hec Brisbane, and Hector Cole. It was said after the trial matches that he and Kirwan had “played themselves into the team by consistent good work of a solo nature”. Webb played one more match for Devonport against Marist on 24 July before being chosen in the New Zealand side to play Auckland on 31 July prior to their departure. The game was very loose with New Zealand not taking it very seriously and they lost 52–32.\nOn 3 August the New Zealand team departed on board the Aorangi with 3,000 there to send them off. They travelled to Suva, Fiji where an exhibition match was played before moving on to Hawaii and then Vancouver where they crossed North America by train before travelling by sea to England. Upon arriving in England the team played Dewsbury however Webb was not picked for this match. In fact he didn't make his debut appearance on the tour until their 8th game against York on 5 October. New Zealand won the match 19-11 before a crowd of 3,100 with Webb playing at five eighth to begin with, with Wilson Hall at half back. It was said that Gregory, Webb, Avery and Henry “were the best of the visitors”. He was reported to have moved to second five eighth “and his side stepping and straight, penetrating runs had the York backs thinking furiously”. Then a short time later he threw a pass to Jim Parkes who would have been in for a try but the pass was ruled forward. Late in the first half Kirwan moved to second five eighth and Webb moved to five eighth due to an injury elsewhere in the side. In the second half Webb secured the ball from a scrum and passed to Parkes who sent the ball on to Kirwan who scored a “brilliant” try which after the conversion gave New Zealand a 12–6 lead. With the lead 17-11 Kirwan moved to the wing due to an injury to him and Sanders moved to five eighth and Webb was pushed out into the centres. New Zealand added a penalty before the match ended. He then played in the following match against Warrington on 9 October. New Zealand lost the match 17–5 with Webb moving into the half back position and Ben Davidson playing at five eighth. The match was played in heavy rain and gale-force winds and Davidson was injured early in the match, leaving the field and not returning until near halftime. He “was virtually a passenger for the remainder of the game”. J O’Shaunessey who was travelling with the team said of Webb that he “is new to the position of half, and has not played there before on the tour, was not impressive. But it must be said he did not see much of the ball”. The Daily News in London gave a fairly brutal assessment when it said that the New Zealand team was “distinctly third rate”, and that “Cole and Webb are negligible in defence and ineffective in attack. In the middle stages of the tour a large ruction occurred in the squad between 7 forwards and the coach Ernest Mair. The players went on strike until it was decided by the English Rugby League that Mair should stand down for a month. The striking players then began taking the field again. Webb played halfback against Wigan Highfield when six of these seven players were in the starting side. The match took place on 17 November and New Zealand won 14–2. Webb had moved into the half back position due to Wilson Hall breaking his arm in the match with Huddersfield on 6 November. Frank Delgrosso had gone on tour as an understudy but it was thought he was more suited to the three quarters position. Webb played half back again in the next tour match against Batley. New Zealand lost 19–17 in atrocious conditions with heavy rain and a wet ground. Webb was said to have been dangerous when in possession along with Ben Davidson, and Lou Brown.\nWebb didn't play again until the 9 December match with St Helen's which New Zealand lost 22–12 in drizzly rain. New Zealand was said to have played well with both sides scoring 4 tries however goal kicking was the difference. Webb played at first five eighth outside Hec Brisbane. George Gardiner who had been playing outside Webb was sensationally sent off after he disputed a line umpire's call for Alf Ellaby's try. The line umpire racially abused Gardiner who then struck the line umpire leading to his dismissal. Webb played in the next match which was a heavy 36–15 defeat to Wigan however Charles Gregory and Jack Kirwan both left the field injured with an injured knee and head injuries respectively leaving New Zealand with just 11 players before Webb was also injured and became something of a spectator. The match see-sawed early with teams exchanging tries before Webb “took a good pass from Davidson, beat the Wigan defence, and again crossed the line” tying the scores at 12 each. This was to be Webb's only points of the tour. Webb was said to have been “tackled hard when going for a try, and although he struggled on and played the game through, he was of little use to his side. He had to be carried to the station with a knee injury, and is likely to be laid up for some time”. Webb took no further part in the tour and returned to New Zealand after their final game which was on 15 January.\nReturn to Devonport and Auckland sides.\nAt the Devonport United annual meeting on 16 March Stan Webb was elected to the committee. When looking at Devonport's prospects for the season in a 6 April New Zealand Herald article it was stated that when in England Webb “received a leg injury which still causes trouble, but it is stated that he intends to play at full-back”. On 30 April he played for a New Zealand XIII consisting of the returning Auckland members of the New Zealand team which had toured England and Wales. They played against Auckland at Carlaw Park and were defeated 24-21 before 14,000 spectators. Webb then played 11 matches for Devonport scoring 3 tries. After three rounds it was said that he had been “showing excellent form, and is also an improved player as a result of going on the tour”. Two weeks later he moved back into the half back position.\nIn early September Webb was selected for Auckland's four game ‘Southern Tour’ of Canterbury the West Coast, Otago, and Wellington. Webb played in three of the matches and scored a try in each. The first match was against Canterbury and Auckland won 24–13 at Monica Park in Christchurch. His try came after he was involved in a passing move with Lou Hutt and Horace Dixon that gave Auckland an 11–10 lead. He didn't play against the West Coast on 14 September which Auckland won 42-15 but was included in the side to play Otago on 17 September. The match was played on the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin and saw Auckland win 20-13 before a crowd of 2,000. Webb scored Auckland's last try after a kick bounced away from Oliver of Otago and Webb grounded it with Craddock Dufty converting. The team then travelled to Wellington. They played Wellington at Newtown Park and won 41 to 23.\nAuckland then returned home. Webb played for them again against Buller at Carlaw Park on 8 October. There were 7,000 spectators on hand to see Auckland thrash them 60–33 with Webb again scoring a try. He then played halfback once more in Auckland's final match of the season against South Auckland. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup and saw Auckland upset 29-12 by the visitors.\nIn 1928 Webb was out of Auckland to begin the season but was intending to play. He didn't in fact make his first appearance until Devonport's round 6 match with Ponsonby United which they won 21–19. He played in 9 matches and scored 2 tries. Devonport won first grade championship for just the third time in their history to this point and their first time in 14 seasons when they last won in 1914. Webb scored a try in their final round win over Ellerslie which secured the title. He then played in Devonport's Roope Rooster semi final loss to Marist Old Boys and a Stormont Shield final loss to the same opponent. These two matches would ultimately turn out to be his last ever appearances for Devonport as he ‘retired’ at the end of the season.\nRetirement, and return to Auckland for Ellerslie United.\nDevonport reported that Webb would “view the game from the bank in future”. On 9 May the Otago Daily Times reported that Webb was moving to Dunedin and would probably represent the City club there however he did not play any rugby league in 1929. Then in 1930 prior to the start of the season it was reported that he would be turning out for Ellerslie United. He played in their opening match with City Rovers and the match was drawn 12-12. He joined Craddock Dufty and Wally Somers in the Ellerslie side. There was a good deal of controversy surrounding the match as Dufty was sent off after disputing a try to Ben Davidson at the end of the match which leveled the scores. City came in for some criticism after the match as they protested the playing of Webb who they believed didn't have a clearance to play for Ellerslie. \nIt was considered ironic as City didn't have clearance to play Davidson but fielded him in the hope that his clearance would be granted belatedly. Davidson had returned from England where he had been playing for Wigan. \nWebb ultimately played 14 matches for Ellerslie and scored 2 tries and kicked a conversion. They struggled during the season but managed 4 wins and a draw to come 7th out of 8 teams in first grade.\nThe 1931 season saw Ellerslie, Otahuhu and Māngere United combine to form a senior team. During the season Māngere fought to remove themselves from the combined side essentially meaning it was a combined Ellerslie-Otahuhu side. Webb played 13 matches for the side and scored 4 tries and kicked 4 penalties. Ellerslie-Otahuhu struggled in the first grade competition winning just 1 game and drawing another to finish last. They were then knocked out in the first round by Richmond Rovers 15–11. The 4 penalties Webb kicked all came in his final ever game of rugby league against Richmond.\nWebb then retired from playing at the end of the 1931 season.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1933 Webb married Kathleen Eagon Hendry, however they were divorced 11 years later in 1944. She had left him some time earlier and Stan petitioned the court for her return but the court ruled in Kathleens favour on June 6 and they divorced after that point. They had no children.\nOn 26 August 1939 a Stanley George Webb was reported in the Auckland Star as seeing a woman's body floating in the Waitematā Harbour near Queen's Wharf by the Auckland Ferry Terminal. The woman (Rose Hannah Nennis) was taken from the water to Auckland Hospital but died the next day. He was reported as being a crane driver employed by the Auckland Harbour Board. His nephew Desmond John Haydon (son of his sister Norina) was killed in action during World War II on 28 June 1942. \nHe died on 6 September 1971 and was buried at the Birkenhead-Glenfield Cemetery."

        "title": "Dublin Hospitals Rugby Cup",
        "text": "The Dublin Hospitals Rugby Cup is a rugby union competition contested by the teaching hospitals in Dublin since 1881. The competition has a claim to the oldest rugby union competition in the world. The United Hospitals Cup in London was started 6 years earlier, but 12 years were not played during the periods of World War I and World War II.\nHistory.\nThe competition was inaugurated in 1881 by a group of Dublin surgeons and physicians. Dr Frank Cassidy served as the first president. The trophy was created by Paul Storr in 1812 as a hunting trophy. It was purchased in 1881 for £50. It remains the oldest sporting trophy in Ireland for which there is an annual competition. \nThe participants of the inaugural tournament included Richmond, Jervis Street, Sir Patrick Dun's, Royal City of Dublin Hospital, Adelaide, Mercer's Hospital, Dr Steevens' Hospital, and Meath. The inaugural title was won by the Meath Hospital who beat Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital at Lansdowne Road.\nPredating the cup, Dublin United Hospitals representative sides played an annual charity match against other Dublin rugby clubs playing as 'County Dublin' in order to raise money for the Hospital Sunday Fund from 1878 until the 1950s.\nThe Dublin Hospitals representative sides have also played annual games against the London United Hospitals.\nLondon beat the Dublin hospitals at Lansdowne Road in 1894 inaugural game.\nThe Dublin Hospitals won the matchup in 1910, 1912,\n1924, 1928, and 1947.\nEligibility to play for hospitals was initially restricted to medical students and interns, this was later expanded to up to 6 graduates per team in 1990.\nCurrent competition.\nThe final, previously played in February at Lansdowne Road, has been played in December at Anglesea Road since the 1960s. In recent years, following the closure and amalgamation of hospitals, five teams compete for the cup: Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's University Hospital, the Federated Hospitals, and the Veterinary Hospital which joined in 2011. \nThe Dental Hospital, which had many memorable victories in the late 1950s and the 1970s, eventually could no longer field a team and joined forces with its Trinity neighbours. The Trinity Federated Hospitals team or Feds represent Dublin Dental University Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital, and St. James's Hospital. Richmond and Jervis amalgamated in 1973 to form an RCSI rugby club, which would win 8 championships during their 14 years in the competition. The side was succeeded by Beaumont in 1987 following the closure of both hospitals.\nInternational Rugby.\nMany medical students and newly qualified doctors who have played in the Hospitals Cup have gone on to represent Ireland or other countries at test level. This occurred more frequently during the early years of international rugby. Of the first 200 players capped for Ireland, 44 had trained in Dublin hospitals. Over 90 players have also been capped for Ireland. This list below includes some of those players:"

        "title": "Roma Capannelle Cricket Club",
        "text": "Roma Capannelle Cricket Club is a Serie A cricket team founded in 1978 in Rome. It is one of the most successful teams in Italy, as well as being one of the oldest (with continuous activity) and with the most years of militancy in Serie A Cricket. With four Serie A titles, ten Italian Cups, five Italian Trophies, and one Championship Six a side for the first team are joined by two women's Serie A titles and the youth Champions of Italy titles: five times Under 13, four Under 13, two Under 17 and one Under 19.\nHistory.\nIn the 1960s in Rome, numerous cricket teams made up of officials from FAO, from the embassies of the United Kingdom, Australia and India, and from pupils and teachers from English schools and colleges gave life to a tournament called Rome Ashes. The matches took place in the Villa Doria Pamphilj, made available by Princess Orietta who had married an English nobleman. Subsequently, following the expropriation of the villa by the Municipality of Rome, cricket began to disappear. At this point, in 1978, the Doria Pamphili Cricket Club, today's Roma Capannelle Cricket Club, was founded by Francis Alphonsus Jayarajah together with Massimo Brian Da Costa, Desmon O'Grady and Sam Kahale in Rome.\nAt the end of the same year the Italian Cricket Association (today the Italian Cricket Federation) was founded in Rome and the first regional championship took place, won by the Doria Pamphili Cricket Club. In March 1997 the Italian national team played the World Cup II group in Malaysia and among those called up there were five Capannelle athletes (Amati, Da Costa, Maggio, Rajapakse, while FA Jayarajah was also present as AIC delegate for international contacts).\nRoma Capannelle C.C. since 1983, thanks to the availability of the Hippodrome, it has the best pitch in Italy. Many of his players have played in the Italian national team confirming the policy implemented for years by Roma Capannelle C.C. which brings young Italians who are discovering this game closer to foreigners residing in Rome. Its captain Francis Alphonsus Jayarajah spread, together with Simone Gambino, former president of the Italian Cricket Federation, this sport in Italy and was the first captain of the Italian national team.\nIn 1988 the R.C.C.C. has seen all four competitions organized by the Italian Cricket Federation, and eight of its players have been selected to play for the national team. He has participated in international tournaments in Spain (in the Costa del Sol), in Paris, in London, in two editions of the European Club Cricket Festival in Durham in which teams from Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, France, Denmark, Switzerland took part. and Germany finishing second. In England, he faced off against the Ascot racecourse team, resulting in a derby between famous racecourses. She also participated, as winner of the 1991 Scudetto, in the Champions Cup in Paris, where, albeit with a reduced line-up due to five holders absent for university exams, she came second.\nIn October 1996 she was invited to participate in the tournament for the 20th anniversary of the FEAX C.C. in Corfu (Greece) with good results. The club's overseas tours are still organized during the summer months, especially visiting England and the city of London against which, after more than three decades, real rivalries have been created against historic London clubs that come to Rome to challenge the Roman club again.\nThe Roma Capannelle Cricket Club in the following years won the Italian Championship five times (1988-90-91-2000-2013) and finished second nine times. Eight times, however, he won the Italian Cup. He was also the winner of numerous tournaments reserved for Italian and young players such as the Italy Trophy (5 out of 7) and the six-a-side Italian Championship to which are added the twelve titles of Italian Champions for Under 13, U15, U17 and U19. In recent years, thanks to the numerous projects to develop and promote Cricket in schools, the club has brought forward the women's section, which won its first two national titles in 2010 and 2011 and has produced dozens of cricket athletes born in Italy.\nOn July 28, 2013, beating the Kingsgrove Milano, the Roma Capannelle Cricket Club becomes champion of Italy for the 5th time in its history.\nIn recent years, Roma Capannelle, the only team in the capital to serve in Serie A, is applying a \"rejuvenation\" that sees in the starting line-up the use of some of the most interesting players in Italian cricket, including Leandro Jayarajah, Michele Morettini, Kevin Kekulawala, Emi Ghulam and Giorgio Scalco together with the younger Maruf Anowar, Ion Racila and Zaryan Ijaz. \nAt the same time the club, in addition to the various youth sections, and the women's team has increased the senior activity, with the addition of the 2nd XI, that is the second team, which includes players with less experience, young and old and marginal players. of the Serie A team. In addition, for the first time in Italy, a formation of Veterans was founded, namely the XL XI, the Over 40 team, mainly in challenges against foreign clubs visiting Rome.\nThe recent tricolor successes of Roma Capannelle CC in the youth sector with two consecutive Under 13 titles and one in the Under 15 confirm that the youth and cricket promotion projects in schools and in the territory that continue to be organized by the Club give own fruits so much that in 2019 the Club opened a new youth sector for the very young: Little Cricket Under 7 - introduction to sport through Cricket."

The Giro began in Torino with an individual time trial on 8 May, and Stage 11 occurred on 19 May with a stage to Montalcino. The race finished in Milan on 30 May.\nStage 1.\nFor the fourth year in succession, the Giro started with a short individual time trial. This year, the Giro started with an test against the clock in Torino. The course was flat all the way through, which meant that the power riders were widely considered as the favourites for the stage victory.\nThe early benchmark time was set by 's David Dekker, the second rider to start, who completed the course in a time of 9' 19\". His time would be beaten by the next rider, Victor Campenaerts of , who took the lead by a few hundredths of a second. Shortly thereafter, Jonathan Castroviejo () beat his time by 5 seconds to move into the hot seat, until Matthias Brändle () set a time of 9' 10\". Later in the day, Dekker's teammate, Tobias Foss, set the new standard with a time of 9' 00\", becoming the first rider to average more than . However, his teammate Edoardo Affini broke the 9-minute barrier and blitzed the course in a time of 8' 57\". He stayed at the hot seat for a long time before the time trial world champion, Filippo Ganna, rode the course as one of the last riders to go down the start ramp. He dominated the course, averaging more than and finishing in 8' 47\", 10 seconds quicker than Affini. It was enough to get him the stage victory and the first \"maglia rosa\" for the second year in succession; in doing so, Ganna would also be the first leader of the points and young rider classifications.\nIn terms of the GC, last year's revelation, João Almeida (), was the best of the favorites, finishing 4th with a time of 9' 04\". His teammate, Remco Evenepoel, who was riding his first race since his crash at last year's Il Lombardia, finished 7th with a time of 9' 06\". Another GC contender who set a fast time was Aleksandr Vlasov (), who finished 11th with a time of 9' 11\", while many of the other main GC contenders were clustered around 35 to 40 seconds back of Ganna.\nAfter Krists Neilands () completed his time trial, he crashed while riding back to the team hotel and fractured his collarbone. As a result, the Latvian was forced to withdraw from the race, being the first rider to do so.\nStage 2.\nThe first road stage of the Giro featured a flat stage from Stupinigi to Novara.\nThis stage was also notable for being held on the 10th anniversary of the death of Belgian rider Wouter Weylandt, who died following a crash on Stage 3 of the 2011 edition. A moment of silence was held in Weylandt's memory prior to the start of the day's race.\nA three-man breakaway broke clear as soon as the flag dropped. The break, composed of Vincenzo Albanese (), Umberto Marengo (), and Filippo Tagliani () were allowed to build up a gap of 4' 20\" before the peloton began to bring them back. On the only categorized climb of the day up to Montechiaro d'Asti, it was Albanese who took the points to become the first wearer of the blue mountains jersey before his time on the front ended due to a mechanical. With to go, Tagliani and Marengo dueled for the first intermediate sprint in Tricerro, which the former won to take maximum points, before Fernando Gaviria took third a few minutes later from the peloton. The remaining duo out front was swept up by the peloton before the second intermediate sprint in Vercelli with to go, which featured bonus seconds for the general classification. Race leader Filippo Ganna took the maximum of three bonus seconds to extend his lead, while Remco Evenepoel took two bonus seconds to move ahead of his teammate João Almeida into 4th place in GC.\nIn the final kilometers, the sprinters and their respective lead-out trains crowded the front of the peloton in preparation for the sprint while the GC teams fought for position at the front to keep their leaders safe. In the final kilometer, there was no clear lead-out train and it was Tim Merlier of Giro debutant team who started his sprint with 200 meters to go. He would not be overtaken as he took the stage and the points jersey in the process. Giacomo Nizzolo finished second with Elia Viviani taking third. Dylan Groenewegen, who was riding his first race following a nine-month suspension, finished fourth. Ganna finished safely in the peloton to keep the \"maglia rosa\".\nStage 3.\nThe third stage featured a hilly course from Biella to Canale. While the first were mostly flat, the final part of the stage featured one third-category climb and two fourth-category climbs. In addition, there was an uncategorized steep climb up to Guarene, which topped with left and offered bonus seconds instead of mountains classification points, before a mostly flat run-in to the finish. \nThe stage began with heavy rain, which gradually let up by the midpoint of the stage. Initially, a seven-man group, including mountains classification leader Vincenzo Albanese () and frequent breakaway participant Simon Pellaud (), went off the front before Pellaud's 18-year-old teammate Andrii Ponomar joined the break following a 10-kilometer chase. The breakaway was allowed a gap of around six minutes before began to close the gap for their sprinter, Peter Sagan. At the first intermediate sprint in Canelli, won by Pellaud, before the day's climbs, the gap was reduced to under four minutes. On the first and second climbs, Vincenzo Albanese took first place to extend his lead in the mountains competition, while also managing to snap a single point by placing third on the third climb. Back in the peloton, continued their fast pace and began to shed most of the sprinters on the second climb in an attempt to eliminate Sagan's rivals for stage victory. The pace of the peloton meant that the breakaway's lead was reduced to just a minute and a half following the last categorized climb.\nAs the break took on the final uncategorized climb, Pellaud attacked his breakaway companions, with only Taco van der Hoorn () and Samuele Zoccarato () able to follow his acceleration. Near the top, Zoccarato was dropped as the duo's lead hovered around 30 seconds. From behind, Giulio Ciccone () and Tony Gallopin () attacked in an attempt to bridge up to the break, but they were unable to close the gap before being reined back in. With to go and the lead hovering around 40 seconds, van der Hoorn dropped Pellaud. He was able to quickly extend his lead to a minute, prompting and to contribute to the chase for their respective sprinters. Heading into the final kilometer, van der Hoorn still had a lead of fifteen seconds, which would prove to be enough for him to take the stage victory, which was both his first in a Grand Tour and the first for , making their Giro debut. Davide Cimolai () led the peloton home four seconds later just ahead of Sagan in third, while race leader Filippo Ganna finished with the peloton to hold on to the \"maglia rosa\".\nStage 4.\nThe fourth stage took on a hilly route from Piacenza to Sestola. The first were mostly flat, followed by a series of hills, before the peloton began to tackle to first of the day's climbs, a third-category hill up to . After that climb, riders descended into the valley before tackling the second third-category climb to and then another uncategorized climb. The finale featured an intermediate sprint for bonus seconds in Fanano at the foot of the second-category climb of Colle Passerino, which averaged almost 10 percent across and included pitches of up to 16 percent. The climb topped with to go before a flat run-in to the line.\nMuch like the previous day, the peloton encountered heavy rain which persisted for much of the day. The first attacks were made by the Belgian duo of Quinten Hermans () and Victor Campenaerts (). Several riders continued to attack from the peloton until 25 riders comprised the day's breakaway. The peloton immediately let the break increase their advantage to around 5 minutes before race leader Filippo Ganna took to the front of the peloton. As the break neared the top of the first third-category climb at Castello di Carpineti, Francesco Gavazzi () attacked, taking the maximum points to defend teammate Vincenzo Albanese's lead in the mountains classification, while a Christopher Juul-Jensen () and the duo of Hermans and Rein Taaramäe pressed on after the climb in pursuit of the stage win. The trio extended their lead to almost two minutes over the rest of the break, putting Taaramäe in a position to possibly take the \"maglia rosa\" at the end of the day. Taaramäe attacked near the top of the second climb, with Juul-Jensen following his move. The duo stayed away for much of the day until Alessandro De Marchi () and Joe Dombrowski () caught up to and passed them on the final climb. Dombrowski launched his move with to go, eventually soloing across the line. De Marchi crossed the line 13 seconds down but finished fast enough to take over the \"maglia rosa\" and the race lead.\nFrom behind, the peloton containing the GC contenders remained calm, with Ganna setting the tempo until he was dropped on the second climb. On the final climb of Colle Passerino, 's co-leader João Almeida was dropped; he eventually lost more than four minutes to the other contenders. Near the top, Mikel Landa () and Giulio Ciccone () attacked before being followed by Egan Bernal (), Aleksandr Vlasov (), and Hugh Carthy () shortly thereafter. The quintet eventually stayed away to finish 11 seconds ahead a seven-man chase group which included Remco Evenepoel (), Simon Yates (), Romain Bardet () and Dan Martin (). Meanwhile, a group containing last year's runner up, Jai Hindley (), Vincenzo Nibali (), and Emanuel Buchmann () lost 34 seconds while George Bennett () lost almost a minute and a half.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage featured a pan-flat route from Modena to Cattolica. There were two intermediate sprints after in Imola and after in Savignano sul Rubicone. After rain persisted for much of the previous two days, sunny skies greeted the riders for the day.\nAfter the flag dropped, Filippo Tagliani () and Umberto Marengo () attacked out of the peloton. The duo was allowed a lead of five minutes before the peloton began to chase. At the first intermediate sprint, Tagliani and Marengo took maximum points but they were reeled in with to go. The peloton remained calm for the next before Simon Pellaud () and Davide Gabburo () attacked with to go. The duo was allowed to build a gap of almost a minute and a half before the peloton began to close them down. With to go, Alexis Gougeard () attacked from the peloton and eventually bridged across to the lead duo, but the peloton was already closing in on the break. The trio would eventually be caught with around to go. led the peloton into the final kilometre. Stage 2 winner and points classification leader Tim Merlier () tried to sprint but he dropped his chain, dropping him out of contention for the win. European and Italian road champion Giacomo Nizzolo () started his sprint first but Caleb Ewan () came from behind to outsprint Nizzolo for the win. With the second place, Nizzolo accrued enough points to gain the lead in the points classification and take the \"maglia ciclamino\".\nSeveral crashes marred the finale of the day's stage, which featured five sharp 90 degree turns in the final . However, most of these crashes occurred before then, meaning that none of the crash victims could benefit from the safety of the three-kilometer rule. Shortly after Gougeard's attack, Tejay van Garderen (), near the back of the peloton, got squeezed against the barriers as the peloton navigated a tight turn and had to stop and remount. With to go, Pavel Sivakov () went down after getting squeezed and colliding with a tree. Though he appeared to be in serious pain, he eventually resumed riding, but by finishing last on the stage and losing over 13 minutes, his GC hopes were all but over. After the stage, medical scans revealed a possible fractured collarbone, forcing Sivakov to abandon the race. Another crash featured Kobe Goossens () and Filippo Fiorelli () with around to go, though both riders were not too seriously injured. The most serious accident took place with to go. As the peloton rode past a traffic island, the previous day's winner and mountains classification leader Joe Dombrowski () collided with the marshal signalling the island, bringing both people down. In the chain reaction, François Bidard () and GC favorite Mikel Landa () also crashed heavily. All three riders remained on the ground in noticeable pain for an extended period of time, and while Bidard and Dombrowski were able to get up and ride to the finish, Landa remained on the ground, surrounded by several of his teammates who had stayed behind to help. Eventually, Landa had to abandon the race and was taken in a stretcher off to a local hospital, where he was diagnosed with a broken collarbone and broken ribs.\nStage 6.\nThe riders tackled the first summit finish of the race on stage six, with the course finishing in atop the climb of San Giacomo. The first gradually went uphill, with an intermediate sprint in Pieve Torina along the way to the base of the first categorized climb, that being the second-category Forca di Gualdo. The third-category climb of the followed in quick succession before riders faced a long descent to the foot of San Giacomo, where there was an intermediate sprint offering bonus seconds in Ascoli Piceno. The final climb of San Giacomo was long with an average gradient of six percent. The first of the climb averaged between five and six percent but the final averaged 7.5 percent. Following their crashes towards the end of the previous day's stage, François Bidard (), who broke his collarbone, and Joe Dombrowski (), who was diagnosed with a concussion, abandoned the race before the start of the stage.\nSeveral riders went clear during the first kilometres but were able to control the initial breakaway. Eventually, six riders went clear after around , while the duo of Geoffrey Bouchard () and Bauke Mollema () eventually managed to bridge the gap to the break after a long chase. The eight-rider break were allowed to build an advantage of around five and a half minutes. At this point, the rain began to fall down heavily. Towards the top of the Forca di Gualdo, former race leader Filippo Ganna began to drive the pace for , eventually dropping the \"maglia rosa\" Alessandro De Marchi in the process. Around into the stage, Manuel Belletti () crashed; the accumulation of this crash, a crash on stage 3, and a crash in the Presidential Tour of Turkey almost a month prior finally took their toll on him and forced his abandonment. On the long descent towards the final climb, a trio of Romain Bardet (), Alberto Bettiol (), and Giulio Ciccone () broke away from the peloton but their escape was short-lived, as the peloton eventually recollected them before they reached Ascoli Piceno at the foot of the San Giacomo climb.\nOn the final climb, Ganna continued to press on the pace, dropping George Bennett () in the process before cracking himself. The continued to decrease the break's lead before Daniel Martínez () attacked with to go. At around the same time, Gino Mäder () attacked from the break. From behind, leader Egan Bernal lit up the race with a series of accelerations to whittle down the GC group, with only Ciccone, Remco Evenepoel (), and Dan Martin () able to follow his move. Despite the GC favorites closing in on Mäder, he managed to hold on and win the stage, taking his first WorldTour and Grand Tour win in the process after coming up just short exactly two months ago on Stage 7 of Paris–Nice. With the points he accumulated on all three of the days' climbs, Mäder also took the lead in the king of the mountains classification. Just twelve seconds later, Bernal, Evenepoel, and Martin would duke it out for the remaining bonus seconds, with Bernal and Martin taking the six and four bonus seconds, respectively, and Ciccone lagging two seconds behind them. Attila Valter (), who started the day in fourth place, finished a further 17 seconds behind the Bernal group to take the \"maglia rosa\" and the race lead, with Evenepoel and Bernal less than 20 seconds in arrears. In doing so, Valter became the first Hungarian to wear the \"maglia rosa\" in the history of the Giro.\nA controversial incident occurred with around to go. As a team car tried to pull up alongside an official race car to collect rain jackets left behind from their riders, the car ran into the back of rider Pieter Serry, who had just been dropped from the group ahead. Serry managed to escape without injuries before going on to finish the stage. For their roles in the incident, \"directeur sportif\" Gene Bates, who was driving the team car, was expelled from the race by the commissaires, while the team's lead \"directeur sportif\" Matt White, who was the passenger in the team car, was fined 2,000 CHF. Following the stage, Bates spoke directly to Serry to apologize for the incident.\nStage 7.\nThe seventh stage of the race featured another chance for the sprinters, with a course from Notaresco to Termoli. There were several uncategorized hills within the first half of the stage alongside the stage's lone fourth-category climb up to Chieti. Following the first intermediate sprint in Crecchio with to go, the course continued down the Adriatic coast and was mostly flat until the finish, with a second intermediate sprint for bonus seconds in Fossacesia with to go. A 200-meter section, averaging about 12 percent, with to go set up the finale of the stage, which was on a slight incline. After losing 20 minutes due to several crashes on the previous stage, 's GC contender Domenico Pozzovivo withdrew before the stage due to an elbow injury.\nAs the flag dropped, a trio of breakaway riders immediately jumped from the peloton. Frequent breakaway members Simon Pellaud () and Umberto Marengo () were joined by Mark Christian (), and they were allowed to establish a maximum lead of around five minutes before the sprinters' teams began to chase. After the trio took the maximum points at the first intermediate sprint, Daniel Oss () successfully led out his teammate, Peter Sagan, to take five points for the \"maglia ciclamino\" competition. Afterwards, the peloton, paced by Thomas De Gendt (), continued to eat into the break's advantage. With to go, the break was eventually swallowed up. On the 200-metre steep section, led the peloton to keep their sprinter, Caleb Ewan, in a good position. As the peloton reached the final kilometer, Francesco Gavazzi () attacked from the peloton and was immediately tailed by Oss. The duo built up a small gap before they were caught shortly thereafter, at which point Fernando Gaviria () made a surprise attack from far out. Ewan calmly closed down the gap to Gaviria before kicking again out of Gaviria's slipstream to win the stage ahead of Davide Cimolai () and Tim Merlier (). Sagan was well-positioned for the sprint but he clipped the barriers, dropping his chain before eventually finishing 14th on the stage. With his second victory of the race, Ewan gained 50 points, enough to take over the lead in the points classification and to don the \"maglia ciclamino\" on the next stage.\nInside the final , one of the main GC favourites, Hugh Carthy (), encountered a problem with his saddle, and after he remounted, TV cameras caught him discussing the incident with race commissaires. Carthy initially finished two minutes behind the main peloton, but given that it was a mechanical problem within the last , he was given the same time as Ewan and the lead group that he was riding in before the problem. As a result, Carthy kept his sixth place in the GC, 38 seconds behind Attila Valter (), who finished safely in the peloton to keep the \"maglia rosa\" ahead of a weekend of mountain stages with uphill finishes.\nStage 8.\nStage 8 was the southernmost of this year's Giro, and it took the riders from Foggia to a first-time stage finish in Guardia Sanframondi for the second summit finish of the race. There was an uncategorized climb after and an intermediate sprint in Campobasso after . Afterwards, the riders tackled the second-category climb of , which was long with an average gradient of 4.5 percent. Following a long descent, the riders passed through the second intermediate sprint, with bonus seconds on offer, in Castelvenere before tackling the final climb to Guardia Sanframondi, which was long at an average of 6.5 percent, with the first averageing at 7.6 percent before easing off towards the top.\nCrosswinds delivered some action at the start of the stage. At one point, 's leader Egan Bernal found himself in a front group with a slight gap on the other favourites, but the move was eventually closed down. As the peloton eased up, a group of eight attacked from the peloton after to finally form the day's breakaway; among the riders was Fernando Gaviria (), who was looking for points in the points competition. Current hour record holder Victor Campenaerts () eventually bridged up to the break after a long chase to make it nine out front. As there was no threat to the \"maglia rosa\" of Attila Valter (), the peloton was content to let the break go, allowing them to build a maximum advantage of around seven and a half minutes. At the first intermediate sprint, Gaviria took maximum points. On the climb of Bocca della Selva, Gaviria attacked, looking to get a head start before the descent. However, he crashed while negotiating a turn on the descent, suffering cuts and bruises in the process, although he was eventually able to bridge back up to the break. On the final climb to Guardia Sanframondi, the break attempted several attacks before an attack from Campenaerts and Giovanni Carboni () managed to stick, and they were able to quickly build a gap of around 10 seconds. Alexis Gougeard () attempted to bridge to them but he would be brought back by the other remnants of the break. On the climb proper, Campenaerts was dropped by Carboni, while behind, Victor Lafay () attacked from the chasing group. He quickly passed Campenaerts and Carboni before soloing to the stage win, his first as a professional. This was also his team's first stage win at the Giro since Stage 17 of the 2010 edition, on which Damien Monier won in a similar fashion from a breakaway atop a summit finish. Second place on the stage went to Francesco Gavazzi (), who made a late attack to try and bridge up to Lafay and finished 36 seconds back, while Carboni and Campenaerts faded to fifth and seventh, respectively.\nFrom behind, was able to take complete control of the peloton. Despite the uphill finish, no contenders attempted to make a move in anticipation of the much tougher stage the next day. Most of favourites finished together almost five minutes behind Lafay, led in by João Almeida (). However, in the final kilometre, a crash involving Pello Bilbao () and Matteo Fabbro () caused a minor split in the group. Because the three-kilometer rule is usually applied flat stages only, this incident was not covered by such an insurance policy. As a result, riders such as Jai Hindley () and Louis Vervaeke (), who was 5th on GC, that were caught behind the crash lost 11 and 25 seconds, respectively, to the other favourites. Bilbao finished a further five seconds behind Vervaeke to limit his losses, while Fabbro lost an additional three minutes.\nCaleb Ewan (), who wore the \"maglia ciclamino\" as the leader of the points classification, abandoned early on during the stage due to knee pain and in order to prepare for the Tour de France, citing that continuing further would hamper his goal of winning a stage in each of the three Grand Tours in a calendar year. Because of this, Tim Merlier (), who was second in the classification behind Ewan, inherited the \"maglia ciclamino\" after the stage.\nStage 9.\nOn Stage 9, the Giro began turning back north as the riders faced the first proper mountain stage of this year's race. The up-and-down route featured very little flat sections and covered just over of elevation with four categorized climbs on the menu along with three other uncategorized climbs. Almost right from the start, riders took on the uncategorized Colle della Croce before the second-category , a climb averaging 4.1 percent. Following this, riders continued north over the uncategorized long Fonte Ciarlotto and the third-category long , both of which had an average gradient of 4.5 percent. In Celano, riders turned almost immediately from the descent of the latter onto the second-category climb up to Ovindoli, which had an intermediate sprint on the lower slopes of the five percent, long climb. The last uncategorized climb to Rocca di Cambio summitted at to go with an intermediate sprint for bonus seconds. The final climb of Campo Felice had an average gradient of 5.8 percent over , with the final of the climb averaging 8.8 percent on gravel roads.\nBefore the stage, Tomasz Marczyński () abandoned due to lingering long COVID symptoms. On the first uncategorized climb, multiple riders, including stage 6 winner Gino Mäder () and stage 8 winner Victor Lafay () looked to ignite a breakaway, but to no avail. On the Passo Godi, a group was able to get a gap of around 30 seconds but , having missed the break, rode hard to chase the group. Over the top of the climb, Mäder took maximum points to extend his lead in the mountains classification, while behind, Daniel Martínez () and Damiano Caruso () attacked from the peloton and eventually bridged across to the front group. On the descent of Passo Godi, a horrific crash in the break happened when Caruso's teammate Matej Mohorič hit a crack in the road and lost his balance, somersaulting over his handlebars and landing on his head; the impact of the crash was great enough that Mohorič's front wheel and fork snapped off the rest of his bike. Though he never lost consciousness and was able to stand up, he abandoned the race upon the advice of race and team doctors; Mohorič would later confirm via Twitter that he escaped with only a minor concussion and no broken bones. The remnants of the initial breakaway were caught just before the next climb. With into the stage, a 17-man group soon broke away on the Fonte Ciarlotto, constituting the final breakaway of the day. The group led by as much as three and a half minutes before took over from at the front of the peloton to set the pace on the penultimate climb of the day up to Ovindoli. As light rain began to fall, Simon Carr () attacked from the break and was joined shortly after by Geoffrey Bouchard (). The latter took maximum points at the summit, which was to propel him into the virtual lead of the mountains classification. \nOn the final climb of the day, with left, Bouchard dropped Carr, who drifted back to a chasing trio composed of Koen Bouwman (), Bauke Mollema (), and Michael Storer (). The -led peloton continued to eat into the gap, which fell below a minute with to go. Bouwman attacked his companions in the chasing group and caught Bouchard on the final gravel section just outside of the final kilometer, but their lead had been further reduced to just 22 seconds by Gianni Moscon, who continued to set a fast pace on the front of the GC group for his team leader Egan Bernal (). At the back end of the group, however, race leader Attila Valter () was finally unable to keep up and was dropped. With around to go, Aleksandr Vlasov () put in an acceleration that prompted Bernal and the other GC favourites to chase him down. Bernal then immediately went around Vlasov and countered with an acceleration of his own, with only Giulio Ciccone () being able to follow. However, as Bernal and Ciccone passed both Bouchard and Bouwman with to go, Bernal put in a second dig to distance Ciccone before soloing to the stage win, seven seconds ahead of Ciccone and Vlasov. Remco Evenepoel (), who wore the white jersey on behalf of Valter, was caught out of position when Bernal attacked but managed to come back and finish fourth, 10 seconds behind Bernal, while Valter finished 49 seconds down. As a result, Bernal took both the \"maglia rosa\" and the \"maglia bianca\", with Evenepoel in second at 15 seconds in arrears and Vlasov in third at 21 seconds behind. The 40 mountains classification points gained by Bernal at the finish vaulted him up the standings with 48 points total, but it was not enough to overtake the 51 points of Bouchard, who donned the \"maglia azzurra\" as the mountains classification leader.\nDuring the stage, the race saw two more abandonments. was further reduced to five riders with the abandonment of Jasper De Buyst, while lost their second rider, Clément Champoussin, who fell ill and could not continue.\nStage 10.\nThe last stage before the first rest day saw the race continue northward from L'Aquila to Foligno, for what was expected to be another opportunity for the sprinters. Once riders rode out of the start town, they would tackle the uncategorized , which averaged 4.2 percent in gradient over , before descending down into the valley below, with the first intermediate sprint in at into the stage. A pair of short uncategorized climbs, the Forca di Arrone and the climb up to Cantoniera, preceded the fourth-category , the only categorized climb of the day, which averaged five percent in gradient over . From its summit with to go, it was downhill to the second intermediate sprint with bonus seconds on offer at Campello sul Clitunno with left, before a flat run-in to the finish.\nRight from the start, the day's breakaway was formed. Simon Pellaud () and Umberto Marengo () were once again part of the break, as was Samuele Rivi () and stage 3 winner Taco van der Hoorn (). missed the initial break attempt, but Kobe Goossens attacked across shortly after to make it a quintet out front. While Goossens and van der Hoorn were content to roll over the intermediate sprint, Marengo, Pellaud, and Rivi had a cagey contest for the points on offer, and Rivi got the better of Marengo while Pellaud settled for third. The break eventually joined back together, but shortly thereafter, they were forced to stop at a closed level crossing to let a train pass. However, because it was a rather quick stoppage, race commissaires deemed it a 'race incident' and the peloton behind were not forced to stop as well in order to maintain the breakaway's advantage, which had already been quite slim but was slashed in half from just under three minutes to around one and a half minutes. On the slopes of the third and last uncategorized climb, Marengo was dropped from the break after an acceleration from Pellaud. Meanwhile, in the peloton behind, took to the front and ramped up the pace, adopting a similar strategy to what they did on stage 3 in order to drop as many of Peter Sagan's sprint rivals as possible. The main damage was done on the Valico della Somma: as Marengo dropped back to the peloton, several sprinters, including Dylan Groenewegen (), \"maglia ciclamino\" Tim Merlier (), and Giacomo Nizzolo (), were among those that could not cope with 's furious pace and were dropped. Giovanni Aleotti, in his debut Giro and Grand Tour, led the train and the peloton over the summit of the Valico della Somma to take the maximum mountains classification points on offer unchallenged, with teammates Daniel Oss and Emanuel Buchmann sweeping up the rest of the points. Victor Campenaerts () had dropped back to try and pace his teammate Nizzolo back up to the peloton, but the duo never managed to chip into their deficit and they eventually resigned themselves to being out of contention for the final sprint. came to front to help , while lined up ahead of the second intermediate sprint for team leader Remco Evenepoel to try and take some bonus seconds. Seeing this, also presented themselves at the front of the peloton, with former race leader Filippo Ganna leading out current race leader Egan Bernal to maintain the latter's 15-second gap over second-placed Evenepoel. Neither GC contender seemed to give the sprint too much effort, but when Bernal's teammate Jhonatan Narváez saw that Bernal would not be able to come around Evenepoel, he let off his own sprint to take the maximum of three bonus seconds, with Evenepoel getting two seconds to Bernal's one to reduce the deficit to 14 seconds.\nInto the final kilometers, took over at the front for their sprinter Max Kanter, but his crash in a turn with to go derailed their plans for a stage win. The crash created a split in the group, leaving only a handful of sprinters left to contest the stage. Juan Sebastián Molano () tried to lead it out for his sprinter Fernando Gaviria, but the latter lost the wheel. Sagan, however, took advantage of the mistake, closing down Molano before starting his sprint from a long way out. Despite that, he was able to hold off Gaviria and Davide Cimolai () to take his second Giro stage win in as many participations; coincidentally, his first Giro stage win happened to be Stage 10 of last year's Giro. The win garnered Sagan 50 points, which was enough for him to take over the lead in the points classification from Merlier and don the \"maglia ciclamino.\" The splits caused by Kanter's crash also saw Aleksandr Vlasov () and Marc Soler () among those to finish seven seconds behind Sagan and 21 seconds ahead of Bernal, but the three-kilometer rule gave everyone caught behind the crash the same finishing time as Sagan, thereby maintaining the GC standings from the day before.\nStage 11.\nThe stage after the first rest day featured four sectors of gravel roads, amounting to a total of and all compacted in the final of the stage. The first of the stage featured a few uncategorized hills before the riders reached the first sector of gravel roads, which was long and mostly descending. The second sector was the first climb of the Passo del Lume Spento, the only categorized climb of the stage, which also featured the first intermediate sprint at Castiglione del Bosco early on into the sector. This was the longest sector of the four, at long. Following the descent, the riders crossed through the second, bonus seconds-offering intermediate sprint in Castelnuovo dell'Abate before immediately tackling the third sector, which was long on an uncategorized climb. Following the descent, the riders tackled the last sector on the Passo del Lume Spento, this time being climbed from a different side. The last sector was long before the riders continued on normal roads the rest of the way up the climb. The stage finished with a long steep ramp after a descent of into Montalcino.\nThe day's breakaway formed as soon as the flag dropped, with 11 riders going off the front. The break was allowed to reach a maximum of 14 minutes, making it more likely that someone from the break was going to take the stage. The break was fully intact on the first sector, but as they approached the second sector, Roger Kluge () and Bert-Jan Lindeman () were immediately dropped. Shortly thereafter, Taco van der Hoorn () followed suit just before the first intermediate sprint. On the descent leading up to the third sector, all three would eventually make it catch back on, although Lindeman was dropped from the break for good through this sector. On the last sector, with the rest of the break still intact, Dries De Bondt () kicked off the hostilities, with Mauro Schmid () and Alessandro Covi () joining him shortly afterwards. As the trio went back to the tarmac and onto the final climb of the Passo del Lume Spento, De Bondt was dropped from the front while Covi and Schmid worked together to build their gap over their breakaway companions. The duo would contest the sprint for the stage win, with Schmid outsprinting Covi to take his first professional win.\nMeanwhile, in the \"maglia rosa\" group, Filippo Ganna () increased the pace on the first sector, causing splits in the group. Remco Evenepoel (), Aleksandr Vlasov (), Simon Yates (), Hugh Carthy (), and Emanuel Buchmann () soon found themselves around 30 seconds behind the Ineos-led front group but they would eventually latch on back just ahead of the second sector. Amidst the chaos in the favourites' group, two riders who started the day in the top ten of the GC, Dan Martin () and Davide Formolo () were definitively distanced on the first sector, with both riders dropping out of contention by the day's end. On the second sector, the group would remain relatively intact before the duo of George Bennett and Tobias Foss attacked near the top of the steep section of the climb. The duo had a gap of around 30 seconds before the () brought them back as they approached the third sector.\nOn the third sector, the () continued to lead the \"maglia rosa\" group, but at the back of the group, Evenepoel was beginning to lose contact. Sensing the opportunity to distance his closest rival at this point, Egan Bernal pressed on the pace. It took a while for João Almeida to drop back and assist his teammate, but by this time, Evenepoel was almost a minute down on the Bernal group. Evenepoel was visibly uncomfortable on the gravel and he would eventually lose two minutes on the day. As the main group of favourites reached the tarmac at the end of the last sector, Giulio Ciccone () made the first acceleration, but he was immediately caught and dropped. Buchmann was the next to attack from the \"maglia rosa\" group, putting on a sustained acceleration to maintain his gap. As the \"maglia rosa\" group began to splinter, Carthy briefly accelerated before Vlasov made a bigger acceleration. However, Bernal immediately stuck to the latter's wheel before producing a counter-attack to drop the rest of the group. Bernal worked together with Buchmann to increase their advantage before the former dropped the latter on the final 200-metre ramp to the line. All of the other favourites crossed the line in drips and drabs from behind.\nIn terms of the battle for the \"maglia rosa\", Bernal increased his advantage to 45 seconds over Vlasov, who rose to second overall, with no other rider within a minute of Bernal's lead. Damiano Caruso () rose to third overall at 1' 12\" behind Bernal. As a result of his efforts, Buchmann rose to sixth overall, while Foss and Daniel Martinez () climbed into the top ten. As for those who lost time on the stage, Evenepoel dropped to seventh overall at almost two and a half minutes behind Bernal, while Ciccone dropped to eighth, having lost almost two minutes on the day. However, the biggest of these losers were Martin and Formolo, who both finished more than six minutes behind Bernal."

        "text": "The 2021 Giro d'Italia will be the 104th edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Giro began in Torino with an individual time trial on 8 May, and Stage 12 occurred on 20 May with a stage from Siena. The race finished in Milano on 30 May.\nStage 12.\nFollowing the previous day's fireworks to Montalcino, the riders tackled another hilly course from Siena to Bagno di Romagna. At , the distance tied the second longest stage of this year's race. There were a few hills during the first part of the stage before the riders passed through the first intermediate sprint after . Immediately afterwards, the riders climbed the third-category climb of Monte Morello. There were also two consecutive second-category climbs before the riders climbed the third-category Passo del Carnaio. The finish featured a descent of before a flat run-in to the finish line.\nAt the start of the stage, there was a crash at the back of the peloton. One of the riders involved was Marc Soler (), lying in 11th overall in GC. He tried to chase back but he eventually had to abandon the race due to back pain. A few kilometres later, there was a serious crash involving former race leader, Alessandro De Marchi (), forcing his abandonment from the race. Following the stage, he was diagnosed with a broken right collarbone, six broken ribs, and broken first and second thoracic vertebra. At the front of the race, several riders tried to attack from the peloton but for the first , no attack would stick. Eventually, a 16-rider break broke clear of the peloton. Nicolas Edet () and Giovanni Visconti () soon bridged over to the break to make it 18 riders out front. Mountains classification leader, Geoffrey Bouchard () was among the riders in the break, while the best-placed rider was George Bennett (), at around 21 minutes down. As such, the break was allowed to stay away, with the peloton allowing them to get a maximum advantage of around 13 minutes.\nAs the break reached the first intermediate sprint, Belgian national champion Dries De Bondt () took maximum points while Bouchard took maximum points at each of the stage's first three climbs. As a result, Bouchard increased his total in the mountains classification to 96 points, double the total of the second-placed Egan Bernal (). The break continued to work together until the final climb of the day, the Passo del Carnaio. Gianluca Brambilla () kicked off the attacks at the front but it was Andrea Vendrame (AG2R Citroën Team) who was able to get a gap on the steepest section of the climb. Eventually, Bennett, Brambilla, and Chris Hamilton () joined Vendrame at the front. The four riders were together over the top of the climb until the descent. With to go, Hamilton attacked his companions, with Vendrame joining him at the front. Bennett and Brambilla were distanced by the attack as they argued and refused to work together. During the sprint for the line, Vendrame proved to be the faster sprinter as he took the stage win.\nIn the \"maglia rosa\" group, Ineos-Grenadiers continued to control the peloton. They rode at a steady pace until the Trek-Segafredo duo of Giulio Ciccone and Vincenzo Nibali attacked on the final climb. Although they would be caught, Nibali continued his attack on the descent. While trying to chase him, Gianni Moscon (Ineos-Grenadiers) slid on a corner but he would get back on the bike and finish the stage. Nibali eventually took 7 seconds on the finish, while most of the contenders finished more than 10 minutes behind Vendrame.\nStage 13.\nThe thirteenth stage featured a pan-flat course from Ravenna to Verona. There was an intermediate sprint after , while the sprint for bonus seconds occurred after . There were no hills or climbs on the route, with the stage representing one of the final chances for the pure sprinters in this year's race.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, two riders, Samuele Rivi () and Umberto Marengo (), immediately attacked from the peloton. Shortly afterwards, Simon Pellaud () joined the duo at the front, representing the final breakaway of the day. The trio was allowed to gain a maximum advantage of around seven and a half minutes before the sprinters' teams kept the break in check. Soon after the first intermediate sprint, tensions arose with the three out front and soon afterwards, the three riders attacked each other. This caused their advantage over the peloton to quickly decrease. While the peloton remained relatively quiet for the majority of the stage, Rémi Cavagna () sensed the possibility of crosswinds with around to go. He was quickly chased down and the peloton eased up once again. The peloton continued to eat into the breakaway's advantage but avoided catching the trio immediately. Eventually, with around to go, the catch was made and the sprinters' teams started to bring their sprinters to the front. Going into the final kilometre, led the peloton to set up their sprinter, Peter Sagan. However, with around 500 metres to go, Edoardo Affini () made a late attack and immediately gaining a few seconds of an advantage. Fernando Gaviria () started his sprint first, despite having lost his saddle on the approach to the line. Giacomo Nizzolo () went to his slipstream, passing Gaviria and Affini to take the stage win. This marked Nizzolo's first Grand Tour stage win, having previously finished second on a stage for a total of 11 times. Affini held on for second while Sagan finished third to keep his lead in the points classification. All of the contenders finished safely in the peloton, ahead of the crucial mountain stage to Monte Zoncolan.\nStage 14.\nThe race went into the high mountains on the fourteenth stage, with the rider tackling the climb of Monte Zoncolan. The first of the stage are mostly flat, with the exception of the fourth-category climb of Castello di Caneva after . Afterwards, the riders climbed the second-category Forcella Monte Rest. The climb is long with an average of 5.9 per cent. Following the descent, the riders went through a valley before making their way towards the base of the climb of Monte Zoncolan. This marked the seventh time that the Giro tackled the climb. Unlike the previous five passages, the riders took on the climb from the Sutrio side for the first time since the climb made its Giro debut in 2003. From Sutrio, the climb is long with an average gradient of 8.5 per cent. The first averaged 8.3 per cent before easing for the next kilometre or so. The last of the climb averaged 13 per cent, including pitches of 27 per cent towards the top. In addition, the riders had to deal with fog and small visibility towards the summit of the climb.\nFor the first part of the stage, several riders tried to attack from the peloton until an 11-man group broke clear. The break was allowed to gain a maximum advantage of around eight and a half minutes before the peloton started chasing. However, Edoardo Affini () and Jacopo Mosca () mainly shared the workload in support of fellow breakaway companions, George Bennett and Bauke Mollema, respectively. As a result, the break maintained their advantage and reached the base of the final climb with a lead of six minutes over the peloton. At the bottom of the climb, Jan Tratnik () got a gap over his breakaway companions. No one immediately reacted to his move until Lorenzo Fortunato () attacked the rest of the chasers. Fortunato eventually bridged over to Tratnik and the pair worked together to increase their advantage. From the chasing group, Alessandro Covi () attacked in an attempt to bridge over to the duo out front but he would not get closer than 40 seconds. With to go, Fortunato dropped Tratnik on the steep portion of the climb. Although he was within Tratnik's sight for the rest of the stage, Fortunato maintained his gap to take his first professional victory. Tratnik finished 26 seconds behind while Covi finished almost a minute down.\nFrom the \"maglia rosa\" group, paced the group for the majority of the stage in support of their leader, Aleksandr Vlasov. On the descent of Forcella Monte Rest, the peloton split into three groups, with Vlasov and Egan Bernal () making it in the first group. and chased in the second group while Remco Evenepoel and chased from the third group. Eventually, the catch was made in the valley before the final climb. Astana continued to pace the peloton on the bottom of the Zoncolan before Ineos-Grenadiers took over with around to go. The first contender to lose touch with the group was Vincenzo Nibali (Trek-Segafredo), who was dropped with around to go. Evenepoel also struggled to follow the pace and was dropped with around to go. Ineos continued to whittle down the group until Simon Yates delivered his first attack with to go. The only rider to go with him was the race leader, Bernal, while the group continued to splinter behind. The pair caught the remnants of the breakaway until Bernal attacked Yates inside the final kilometre. Bernal finished fourth on the stage, with Yates losing 11 seconds. A trio consisting of Daniel Martinez (Ineos-Grenadiers), Damiano Caruso (Team Bahrain Victorious), and Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo) finished 39 seconds behind Bernal. Emanuel Buchmann () and Hugh Carthy (EF Education–Nippo) lost 46 and 54 seconds, respectively. Despite the work of his team, Vlasov struggled inside the final 3 kilometres and lost more than a minute while Evenepoel shipped more than a minute and a half.\nIn terms of the GC, Bernal increased his advantage to more than a minute and a half over the second place, now occupied by Yates. Caruso maintained his third place, but he was now 1' 51\" behind while Vlasov dropped to fourth at 1' 57\" behind. Carthy and Buchmann were now over two minutes down with Ciccone more than three minutes down. Evenepoel dropped to eighth at almost four minutes behind Bernal.\nStage 15.\nThe fifteenth stage took the riders on a hilly course from Grado to Gorizia. The first were mostly flat with an uncategorized climb after and an intermediate sprint after . Afterwards, the riders entered Slovenia before tackling three laps of a circuit, with the circuit consisting of the fourth-category climb of Gornje Cerovo. Following the third passage of the climb, the riders deviated from the circuit before reaching the second intermediate sprint at Nova Gorica with to go. Immediately afterwards, there was a short steep ramp before reaching the finish at Gorizia.\nAs soon as the flag dropped, several riders went on the attack. However, there was a big crash in the peloton involving a bunch of riders. The crash led the commissaires to neutralize and stop the race so that the affected riders could receive assistance. The riders who were severely involved included Natnael Berhane (), Jos van Emden (), and Emanuel Buchmann (), who was lying in sixth overall in the GC. All riders would eventually abandon the race, while another rider, Ruben Guerreiro (), also abandoned later in the stage. As soon as the riders restarted, a group of 15 riders broke clear. The peloton immediately eased up and let the break go. A chasing group of four also tried to join the break but they were eventually caught by the peloton. At the first intermediate sprint, Dries De Bondt () attacked to take maximum points while also taking maximum points at the first two ascents of Gornje Cerovo. With to go, Oscar Riesebeek (Alpecin-Fenix) attacked, with Victor Campenaerts () immediately marking him. The duo would eventually be caught by the rest of the break. The break continued to attack each other until Campenaerts attacked with to go. Riesebeek and Albert Torres () joined his move as torrential rain started to fall on the stage. Despite some discussions with regards to workload, the trio reached the bottom of the final climb with a lead of 30 seconds over the rest of the break. Towards the top of the climb, Torres struggled to follow the pace and he would eventually drop back to the group of chasers. On the run-in to the finish, the duo attacked each other several times, resulting in their lead decreasing to less than 20 seconds. However, the duo would maintain their advantage heading into the final kilometre. The two riders played cat and mouse until Riesebeek first started his sprint. However, Campenaerts was able to outsprint him to take his first Grand Tour stage win. The peloton remained relatively calm for the whole stage and they eventually finished more than 17 minutes behind Campenaerts. As a result, the GC remained unchanged ahead of the race's queen stage to Cortina d'Ampezzo.\nStage 16.\nThe sixteenth stage from Sacile to Cortina d'Ampezzo was considered as the queen stage of this year's race, with four first-category climbs on the stage's original route. From the get-go, the riders tackled the climb of La Crosetta, an climb with an average gradient of 7.1 per cent. Following the descent and a valley, next on the route was the Passo Fedaia. The climb is long with an average gradient of 7.5 per cent. Immediately following the descent is the climb of Passo Pordoi, an climb with an average gradient of 6.6 per cent. At a height of 2,231 metres, the climb was the \"Cima Coppi\" as the highest point reached in this year's race. The last climb of the day was the climb of Passo Giau. The climb was long with an average gradient of 9.3 per cent. The finish of the stage ended at Cortina d'Ampezzo following a descent of .\nHowever, on the day the stage was run, there was heavy rain on the route as well as snow on the last three climbs of the day. Before the stage was supposed to start, there were discussions as to whether the route was going to be modified or whether the original route was still going to be ridden. At one point, there was also a discussion to neutralize the first part of the stage and to take the GC times at the top of the Giau. Despite the riders wanting to race the original route, the original route was eventually changed and shortened due to the weather, bypassing the climbs of the Fedaia and the Pordoi and leaving only the Crosetta and the Giau in the race. The cancellation of the Pordoi meant that the \"Cima Coppi\" was now awarded to the first rider over the summit of the Giau. The weather also caused the live TV coverage to encounter problems throughout the day. The coverage was stopped near the top of the Giau and on the descent to the finish, while still showing the final few hundred metres of the stage. \nFollowing the start of the stage, a 24-man breakaway formed. Some of the notable names in the break included mountains classification leader, Geoffrey Bouchard (), and some contenders who already lost time such as Dan Martin (), João Almeida (), Davide Formolo (), and Vincenzo Nibali (). After Bouchard took maximum points at the top of La Crosetta, the break split on the descent. Six riders broke away from the original break, including Nibali, Almeida, and Formolo, and they continued to increase their advantage over the rest of the break. The sextet also had a maximum advantage of around five minutes over the -led peloton. Soon after, the peloton caught the rest of the original break with to go. With around to go, started to pace the peloton and they started to decrease the break's advantage. As the road gradually went uphill towards the base of Giau, the break's advantage was down to less than two minutes. At this point, Remco Evenepoel (Deceuninck–Quick-Step) lost contact with the \"maglia rosa\" group. He eventually lost more than 24 minutes at the end of the day. As the break neared the base of Giau, Antonio Pedrero () accelerated to take a slim gap over the rest of the break. It was also at this point that Aleksandr Vlasov () suffered an untimely mechanical, putting him at a disadvantage as the \"maglia rosa\" group approached the Passo Giau.\nOn the final climb, Pedrero was soon caught by Nibali and Formolo. Almeida was dangling a bit further back before Formolo accelerated at the front. From behind, Simon Carr (EF Education–Nippo) started to increase the pace as riders began to drop from the group. This made it hard for Vlasov to get back to the group following his mechanical. The first favorite to lose contact was Simon Yates () while up front, Pedrero caught Formolo before accelerating once again. Almeida soon overtook Nibali and Formolo as he chased Pedrero. With their deficit to the break at just around a minute, Egan Bernal (Ineos-Grenadiers) accelerated from the group of favorites. Hugh Carthy (EF Education–Nippo) tried to follow his move but he would soon drop back. Bernal soon caught the rest of the break before going solo off the front. His closest pursuers were Damiano Caruso () and Romain Bardet () but Bernal continued to increase his advantage all the way to the top of the climb. Bernal took the \"Cima Coppi\" with Caruso crossing the summit 45 seconds later. Bardet was 1' 15\" behind while a trio composed of Carthy, Almeida, and Giulio Ciccone (Trek–Segafredo) was a minute and a half behind. Vlasov soon crossed the summit after dropping Yates, who continued to struggle and continued to lose time.\nOn the descent from the Giau, Bernal rode somewhat conservatively while Bardet caught Caruso. The pair was able to decrease their deficit to around half a minute. However, Bernal continued to maintain his advantage. He took his second stage win of the race while Bardet and Caruso crossed the line at a deficit of 27 seconds to Bernal. The trio of Ciccone, Carthy, and Almeida soon crossed the line almost a minute and a half behind. Vlasov lost more than two minutes on the day while Yates lost more than two and a half minutes. In the GC, Bernal increased his advantage to almost two and a half minutes over Caruso, who now occupies second place. Carthy rose to third overall but he was now more than three and a half minutes behind Bernal. Vlasov, Yates, and Ciccone occupied the next three spots in the GC but they were now around four and a half minutes behind. As a result of his gains on the stage. Bardet rose to seventh overall at five minutes behind. Almeida also climbed back into contention as he climbed inside the top ten, more than ten minutes behind Bernal.\nStage 17.\nFollowing the second rest day, the riders faced another summit finish with the climb of Sega di Ala at the end of the stage. The first of the stage were on a slight downhill before the riders tackled a third-category climb after . Afterwards, the riders faced a long descent before passing through the first intermediate sprint after . 30 kilometres later, the riders passed through the second intermediate sprint. With to go, the riders tackled the first-category climb of Passo San Valentino. The climb is long with an average gradient of 7.8 per cent. Following the descent and a short flat portion, the riders faced the final climb of Sega di Ala, which is being used for the first time in the Giro. The climb goes on for with an average gradient of 9.5 per cent. The climb is steep for the most part before easing up in the last , with the climb averaging 4.8 per cent at that point.\nAt the start of the stage, several rider attempted to attack from the peloton but none would stick for a while. prevented any break from sticking for the first before letting go of a group on the third-category climb. 19 riders went off the front, including Dan Martin who was the best-placed GC rider at over 15 minutes down. Geoffrey Bouchard () also made it into the break in an attempt to extend his lead in the mountains classification. The break was allowed to gain a maximum advantage of around 5 minutes before took over on the front of the peloton. The break soon reached the bottom of the first-category Passo San Valentino with a lead of around 3 minutes. Towards the middle of the climb, Martin accelerated from the rest of the break and only Bouchard, Gianni Moscon (Ineos Grenadiers), and Antonio Pedrero () could stay with him. Bouchard took maximum points at the top of the climb to extend his lead, while the peloton crossed the summit with a deficit of just under 3 minutes. On the descent, Giulio Ciccone () suffered a mechanical but he was able to get back to the \"maglia rosa\" group. However, with to go, a crash took down several riders in the peloton, including Remco Evenepoel () as well as two domestiques for Simon Yates (Team BikeExchange), Nick Schultz and Mikel Nieve. While Evenepoel and Schultz would continue and finish, they would eventually abandon after the stage. Ciccone was also caught up in the crash after having just made it back from his mechanical. At the front of the race, Giovanni Carboni () and Simone Ravanelli () rejoined the break just before the final climb of Sega di Ala.\nAt the bottom of the final climb, Martin accelerated to drop the rest of the break, while the peloton was only around a minute and a half behind. Shortly after, Ineos Grenadiers took over the front of the \"maglia rosa\" group, with Jonathan Castroviejo setting a steady pace. With around to go, Aleksandr Vlasov began to lose contact to the group of favorites while Ciccone began to pay for his earlier efforts to come back and he was soon dropped. With around to go, Romain Bardet (), Hugh Carthy (), and Tobias Foss () were also dropped. While Foss was able to briefly get back, Bardet and Carthy were definitively distanced and would lose a big chunk of time on the day. With to go, João Almeida (Deceuninck–Quick-Step) attacked, with no rider immediately reacting to his move. Shortly afterwards, Yates attacked and only the Ineos Grenadiers duo of race leader, Egan Bernal, and Daniel Martínez could follow him. The trio would immediately get back to Almeida, while Martin still led the stage with a lead of around a minute. With to go, Bernal suffered his first crisis when he was dropped by Yates and Almeida. At one point, he was unable to follow the pace of Martínez while Damiano Caruso and Pello Bilbao (), as well as Diego Ulissi (), was able to get back to the group of Bernal. With around a kilometre to go, Almeida attacked and dropped Yates in pursuit of the stage win. However, Martin was able to hold on to take his first Giro stage win. With the victory, Martin completed the hat-trick by taking stage victories at all three Grand Tours. Almeida crossed the line 13 seconds after Martin while Yates finished 30 seconds behind. Caruso and Ulissi crossed the line at 1' 20\" behind, with Bernal and Martinez crossing a further 3 seconds in arrears. Foss finished 2' 21\" behind while Bardet finished almost three minutes back. Vlasov was able to limit his losses, finishing more than three minutes behind while Carthy lost almost four minutes. Ciccone suffered the biggest loss on the day as he finished almost eight minutes back.\nIn the GC, Bernal lost three seconds to second-placed Caruso but he still maintained a lead of almost two and a half minutes. Yates gained 57 seconds on Bernal while also moving up to third at almost three and a half minutes down. Vlasov, Carthy, and Bardet were now over six minutes down as a result of their time losses, while Martínez is now seventh at more than seven minutes down. Almeida jumped up to eighth at around eight and a half minutes behind, with Foss at more than nine minutes behind. As a result of his time loss, Ciccone dropped to tenth at more than 11 minutes down.\nStage 18.\nThe eighteenth stage was the longest of this year's Giro, with a distance of . The first of the stage was mostly flat before the riders tackled a series of four short climbs in the final part, with a single fourth-category climb with to go. There were two intermediate sprints after and after . With two mountain stages and a time trial stage left after this stage, this marked the final chance for Peter Sagan's () rivals to overtake him in the points classification.\nBefore the stage began, Giulio Ciccone (), lying in tenth overall in the GC, abandoned the race due to the injuries he sustained in the previous day's crash. After the flag dropped, it would take a while before a 23-man break was let go by the peloton. would take station at the front of the peloton to set a steady pace and they would eventually roll over the line 23 and a half minutes down. The break would stay together for the majority of the stage until a six-rider group detached themselves from the break on the first climb of the day. Following a regrouping, Rémi Cavagna () attacked on the lone categorized climb of the day. Alberto Bettiol () and Nicolas Roche () emerged as his closest pursuers while the break began to splinter behind. Cavagna would build a lead of around half a minute before he crossed the top of the climb while Bettiol and Roche would be caught by a chase group. Cavagna started the penultimate climb with a lead of 30 seconds before Bettiol took off alone from the chase group to track down Cavagna. At the top of the penultimate climb, Bettiol managed to decrease Cavagna's advantage to only 12 seconds while Roche would latch back on to Bettiol on the descent. Cavagna extended his advantage a bit just before the final climb but Bettiol, after dropping Roche, was able to catch him with to go. With to go, Cavagna cracked as Bettiol went off in pursuit of the stage win. Bettiol would eventually hold on to the stage win, 17 seconds ahead of the chasing group. With the win, Bettiol took his first Grand Tour stage victory. Apart from Ciccone's withdrawal, the GC remained unchanged ahead of the final three crucial stages of this year's Giro.\nStage 19.\nThe nineteenth stage kicked off a trio of stages that will be crucial to determining the final placings in the GC. The riders tackled three categorized climbs on the day. Originally, the first climb is the first-category climb of Mottarone but following the cable car crash on 23 May, the Mottarone climb was replaced by the fourth-category climb of Alpe Agogna. After a short descent, the riders passed through the first intermediate sprint with to go. Afterwards, the riders gradually climbed towards the bottom of the third-category Passo della Colma. The climb is long with an average gradient of 6.4 per cent. Following the descent, the riders again gradually climbed towards the second intermediate sprint and the bottom of the final climb of the day, the Alpe di Mera. The climb is long with an average gradient of 9 per cent. The climb gradually goes steeper towards the end, with the final averaging 10.4 per cent along with pitches of up to 14 per cent.\n after the flag dropped, six riders went off the front of the peloton. The sextet gained a maximum advantage of around three minutes before took station at the front of the peloton. After the first climb of Alpe Agogna, started to contribute to the pace as they searched for their first stage win in the race. With to go, Deceuninck–Quick-Step set such a furious pace that the peloton split up. Daniel Martínez (), lying in 7th overall in the GC, was among the riders that were caught up in the second peloton. With the help of Filippo Ganna, who dropped back from the \"maglia rosa\" group, Martínez was eventually able to get back to the peloton. Soon afterwards, a crash in the peloton caused Gianluca Brambilla () to abandon the race. The peloton gradually decreased the break's advantage, with Deceuninck–Quick-Step leading the peloton onto the final climb of Alpe di Mera. At this point, only Mark Christian () remained at the front of the race. From behind, race leader Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) still had two domestiques in Martínez and Jonathan Castroviejo.\nWith to go, João Almeida (Deceuninck–Quick-Step) attacked in pursuit of the stage win. Castroviejo quickly took station at the front of the \"maglia rosa\" group before Simon Yates (Team BikeExchange) attacked shortly thereafter. Three other riders, Damiano Caruso (), Aleksandr Vlasov (), and George Bennett () also joined Yates and Almeida on the attack to make it a five-man group at the front of the race. Bernal remained in his group, preferring to utilize his teammates to prevent the gap from increasing. The group up front led by as much as 20 seconds before Yates accelerated off the front with to go. Bennett was eventually dropped from the chasing group while Hugh Carthy () attacked from the \"maglia rosa\" group, eventually making it to the chase group. Sensing the \"maglia rosa\" group slowly catching the chase group, Vlasov counterattacked but he would eventually be swallowed as well. Martínez continued to drop riders from the \"maglia rosa\" group while the gap to Yates was still at around 20 seconds. With to go, Martínez finished pacing at the front and Bernal was able to get a small gap. The only rider who was able to stay with Bernal was Almeida while Yates continued to lead at the front. Inside the final kilometre, Almeida dropped Bernal but Yates held on to the stage win, 11 seconds ahead of Almeida. Bernal crossed the line 28 seconds down while Caruso and Vlasov finished a further 4 seconds in arrears. In the GC, Bernal increased his advantage over Caruso to 2' 29\". As a result of his win, Yates moved to within 20 seconds off of Caruso's second place while there were no other riders within six minutes of Bernal's lead. Aside from the increase in time gaps, there were no movements inside the top ten.\nStage 20.\nThe penultimate stage of the race took the riders over three first-category climbs in the final half of the stage, finishing with a summit finish at the climb of Alpe Motta. The first were mostly flat, along with an intermediate sprint after . After the race entered Switzerland, the riders tackled the climb of Passo San Bernardino. The climb is the longest of this year's Giro with a length of and an average gradient of 6.2 per cent. Following a short descent, the riders tackled the climb of Passo Dello Spluga, which has a length of and an average gradient of 7.3 per cent. The summit represented the Swiss/Italian border as the riders went back to Italy on the descent. The final climb of the Giro is the Alpe Motta. The climb goes on for with an average gradient of 7.6 per cent. Towards the middle of the climb, there is a kilometre which averaged 0.8 per cent, with this section including the intermediate sprint for bonus seconds.\nIn the first part of the stage, no break went away as the riders reached the intermediate sprint. In the sprint, points classification leader Peter Sagan () elected to simply control the sprint. While his main rivals, Davide Cimolai () and Fernando Gaviria (), were able to take some points, Sagan's lead was still large enough that he only had to make it through to Milan to take the \"maglia ciclamino\". After the sprint, it would take a while until a group of nine riders broke away from the peloton after . The break would be allowed to build a maximum advantage of around five minutes before , , and started chasing. By the foot of the first climb of the day, the break's lead was decreased to three and a half minutes. On the climb of Passo San Bernardino, Louis Vervaeke () instigated the attacks up front. Four other riders would eventually join him but their advantage rapidly decreased all the way to the top of the climb after increased the pace in the peloton. At the summit of the climb, the break's lead was down to less than a minute. From the peloton, a trio of Team DSM riders, including Romain Bardet, attacked on the descent. The duo of Damiano Caruso and Pello Bilbao also joined the move, prompting to take up the chase as Caruso was the closest threat to Egan Bernal's \"maglia rosa\". The quintet joined the break up front and they started the climb of Passo Dello Spluga with a lead of around 20 seconds over the peloton.\nOn the climb, Bilbao and Michael Storer (Team DSM) set a furious pace up front, dropping all of the breakaway riders as only four riders, including Caruso and Bardet, remained at the front. The pace allowed the quartet to build a lead of around 50 seconds over the Ineos-led peloton. They eventually crossed the summit with a lead of 43 seconds. On the descent, Aleksandr Vlasov () tried to cause some splits in the peloton but there would be a regrouping as the riders continued to descend. Up front, the quartet's advantage stabilized to around 40 seconds as Jonathan Castroviejo (Ineos Grenadiers) kept them in check. Near the foot of the final climb, Storer was the first to be dropped as Bilbao continued to work for Caruso. With to go, Bilbao was eventually distanced while Caruso picked up the pace. From behind, Daniel Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers) set a fast pace that decreased the leading duo's advantage to less than 30 seconds. His pace also dropped every rider in the group of favorites with the exception of his leader, Bernal. With to the top, Caruso dropped Bardet as he set off in pursuit of the win. Caruso would eventually solo to the stage win, his first Grand Tour victory. He crossed the line 24 seconds ahead of Bernal and 35 seconds ahead of Martínez and Bardet. The other favorites crossed the line in drips and drabs from behind. In terms of the GC, Bernal solidified his lead as he went into the final stage time trial with a lead of almost two minutes over Caruso. Yates lost more than half a minute to Bernal but he had more than three minutes on hand over Vlasov in fourth, almost ensuring him of the third step on the podium. Additionally, the fifth to eighth spots in the top ten were only separated by around a minute heading into the time trial. As the ascent of Alpe Motta was the final climb of the race, Geoffrey Bouchard () also sealed his lead in the mountains classification and he only has to finish the time trial to officially win the \"maglia azzurra\".\nStage 21.\nFor the third successive year, the Giro finished with an individual time trial. In this occasion, the course was twice as long as the final time trials in the previous two years, with the riders tackling a course from Senago to Milan. Time splits were taken after and after . The course is flat all the way through which meant that the course suited the pure time trialists.\nThe first rider to set a good time was Maciej Bodnar (), setting a time of 34' 42\". However, the time would soon be beaten by Filippo Ganna (), the time trial world champion, as he set a time of 33' 48\". His ride did not go as smoothly as planned as he suffered from a flat tire with around to go. His time would stand as the best time for the rest of the day, taking his fifth consecutive victory in time trials at the Giro. Edoardo Affini (), who started shortly after Ganna started, came close to beating Ganna's time but he eventually fell short by 13 seconds. Another rider who threatened Ganna's time was French time trial champion, Rémi Cavagna (). He was 13 and 18 seconds down after the first and second intermediate time checks, respectively. However, he crashed into the barriers inside the final kilometre, ending his chances of beating Ganna's time. He got back on his bike quickly but he eventually finished second, 12 seconds behind Ganna's time. Along the way, Peter Sagan (Bora–Hansgrohe) and Geoffrey Bouchard () safely negotiated the course to confirm their victories in the points and mountains classification, respectively.\nSoon, the GC contenders started the course. While the top four riders had enough gap from each other to retain their positions, the fifth to eighth riders were only separated by 1' 02\". The first of those riders to go down the start ramp was João Almeida (Deceuninck–Quick-Step). He set a time of 34' 15\", 27 seconds behind Ganna and good for fifth on the stage. His ride was enough to leapfrog both Romain Bardet () and Hugh Carthy (), who set times of 35' 58\" and 36' 15\", respectively. Almeida also came close to passing Daniel Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers) for fifth in the GC but he fell short by fractions of a second as Martínez set a time of 35' 09\", 14th on the stage. Aleksandr Vlasov set a time of 35' 14\", good for 19th on the stage to confirm his position as fourth in the GC. Simon Yates () set a time of 36' 33\" to retain the last step on the podium while Damiano Caruso () finished with a time of 35' 11\" to finish on the podium for the first time in his career. Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers), the race leader, was the last rider off the start ramp. He safely negotiated the course, finishing with a time of 35' 41\" and celebrating his first Giro victory as he crossed the line. This also marked his second Grand Tour victory overall, after his Tour victory in 2019. He also took home the victory in the young riders classification. The traditional prize-giving commenced shortly afterwards."

        "text": "The 1928–29 Marquette Hilltoppers men's ice hockey season was the 7th season of play for the program.\nSeason.\nMarquette entered the year looking to repeat as league champions and, with most of their players returning, the newly renamed Hilltoppers would have a good chance. The \"Two Macs\", MacKenzie and McFadyen led the way at the start, opening the year with four huge wins over NIHL opponents. In the second game against Michigan, the play turned rough and several Hilltoppers ended up with serious injuries; McFadyen broke a rib MacKenzie was cut over the eye, Buck had four teeth knocked out and Horrigan sprained his ankle. This put the team in a difficult position 4 days later when they took on Chicago A.C.; rough play continued to the point when Marquette officials considered pulling their team off of the ice but they allowed the match to conclude with the Blue and Gold losing their first game of the season. When Marquette took on Wisconsin on the 18th, approximately 2,000 people showed up to see the Hilltoppers trounce the Badgers 9–0. The ice hockey team had become a big draw at Marquette and with the program continuing to play well under Kay Iverson, there was no reason to think that would change any time soon.\nAfter a few weeks off, Marquette returned to the ice against Janesville at a nearby winter carnival. An easy victory set them up for a rematch against Chicago A.C. and the team got their revenge against the amateur club with a 4–1 victory. The following weekend was the first of two showdowns against Minnesota and the two best teams in the west. The Hilltoppers looked like a shoo-in to repeat their championship when they took the first game 5–2 but the Gophers rallied for a victory in the second game, handing the Blue and Gold their first conference loss of the season. Both games were seen by about 2,500 fans despite the bitter cold. After Marquette's final home game of the year, another victory, the team hit the road but were stunned by Wisconsin and handed a 0–1 loss. The result came as a surprise, especially considering the Blue and Gold's earlier 9–0 win. The loss was matched, however, with one by Minnesota a week earlier making the two teams essentially tied for the Intercollegiate lead. Marquette didn't play another game for three weeks and a final series was scheduled in Minnesota against the Gophers. The Hilltoppers didn't look rusty at all to start the game and they scored twice in the first to take a 2–1 lead. Unfortunately, Minnesota shut them down the rest of the game and scored three times to win 4–2. Marquette had to win the game to have any hope of holding on to their crown and both teams played a tough game. McFadyen scored in the second for the Hilltoppers but Minnesota's defense proved too good and skated to a 2–1 victory, consigning Marquette to runner-up status.\nOliver Seahawer served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

The team represented Harvard University and was coached by Joseph Stubbs in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nThe defending intercollegiate co-champions began their season with 75 men trying out for the team. After coach Stubbs whittled the team down to size, the Crimson debuted against MIT and won comfortably, 7–2. After the game the team took a few weeks off before reprising their annual meeting with Toronto at Madison Square Garden. This time the Crimson came away victorious and then embarked on a road trip to Canada. They trounced Michigan 7–0 and then won a close victory over McGill to keep their record unblemished. On their way home, Harvard stopped in Syracuse for another victory.\nThe Crimson had a busy week, playing at home for a match before hitting the road and then returning for the final before breaking for examinations. In the three games the Crimson didn't allow a single goal and scored 25 times to push their record to a perfect 8–0. They played their first game at Army's new rink and faced Middlebury for the first time in program history.\nAfter a month off, Harvard returned to the ice against Dartmouth. The time off looked to have dulled the Crimson but the team still managed to win 4–2. After a close shave in the rematch in Hanover, the team headed to Canada a second time to visit McGill. team captain Harwood Ellis led Harvard to its fifth shutout of the season and returned home with a sterling 11–0 record. The Crimson were set to face Yale to end the year, with neither team having lost a single intercollegiate game, and the winner would be crowned the Eastern Intercollegiate Champion. The vaunted Harvard offense that existed before the extended break never materialized. The Crimson scored once in each of the two games against Yale and the team had to resign itself to second-best in 1931.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "A bronze equestrian statue of King Charles II on horseback sits in the Upper Ward of Windsor Castle beneath the castle's Round Tower. It was inspired by Hubert Le Sueur's statue of Charles I in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The statue was commissioned by Tobias Rustat, Charles's valet. Rustat was a significant philanthropist of the 1670s. Rustat's fortune was partially derived from the transatlantic slave trade, having been an investor in the Royal African Company.\nThe rear left hoof of the horse is inscribed 'Josias Ibach Stada Bramesis 1679 FUDIT'. Gibbons had been appointed the 'Surveyor and Repairer of Carved Work at Windsor' in 1682. The Royal Collection Trust listing for the statue describes the design as \"very innovative\" in its depiction of Charles as a Roman emperor with its absence of traditional symbols of the British monarchy such as the Order of the Garter. Charles is depicted wearing a suit of armour in a classically Roman style, without spurs and stirrups for his horse. He is crowned with a laurel wreath. The statue started a subsequent trend for British monarchs to be portrayed in a Roman style.\nThe statue may have been inspired by the \"Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius\" that was originally situated on the Capitoline Hill in Rome with its similar placing of the horse and design of the plinth."

In the context of NCAA Division I women's basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently ranked in the top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of No. 1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll.\nBold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nIn addition to the above listed upsets in which an unranked team defeated a ranked team, there have been five non-Division I teams to defeat a Division I team so far this season. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences will end its regular season with a single-elimination tournament.

Unless otherwise noted, the winners of these tournaments will receive automatic invitations to the 2022 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nStatistical leaders.\nIncludes postseason games. Division I record in bold.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, an \"upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 5 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball."

The site is by the river which forms the frontier with China. There was formerly a village there but this was destroyed by flooding in 1991. The course was designed by a professional golfer from Myitkyina, Nay Min. Six holes were constructed, starting in 2006, and there are plans to add three holes.\nThis golf course is open to the public for use even during war time. The course consists of 6 holes.\nThe golfers are mostly army officers or officials of the Kachin Independence Organisation but the course is open to the public and a round costs Ks.1,000/- – about 1 US$. The Laiza golf club is argued to be the cheapest golf club in the world. \nHoles and features.\nThe longest hole is 645-yard par 5. Hole 1 is a 358-yard par 4 and hole 4 is a 392-yard par 4. Hole 5 has a memorial to the 1991 flood victims. \nThe course has 15 sand traps and other hazards including the adjacent banana plantation and river. \nThere are 8 staff and a clubhouse with refreshments. The caddying is typically performed by girls displaced by incursions of the Burmese army.\nEvents.\nThere are four tournaments each year which are typically held on holidays. Other tournaments have been held monthly but these may be disrupted by the level of military conflict."

        "text": "The 2022 Masters (officially the 2022 Cazoo Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 9 to 16 January 2022 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. It was the 48th staging of the Masters tournament, which was first held in 1975, and the second of three Triple Crown events in the 2021–22 snooker season, following the 2021 UK Championship and preceding the 2022 World Snooker Championship. Broadcast by the BBC and Eurosport in Europe, it was sponsored for the first time by car retailer Cazoo.\nThe participants were invited to the tournament based on the world rankings as they stood after the UK Championship. Some players took issue with the cut-off date, noting that the in-form Luca Brecel, who had entered the top 16 by winning the 2021 Scottish Open in December, did not qualify as the event took place after the UK Championship. Ding Junhui, who had made 15 consecutive Masters appearances between 2007 and 2021, fell out of the top 16 after the UK Championship and failed to qualify. Zhao Xintong, who entered the top 16 for the first time by winning the UK Championship, was the only Masters debutant. John Higgins set a new record of 28 Masters appearances, surpassing Jimmy White and Steve Davis, both of whom had competed 27 times.\nYan Bingtao was the defending champion, having defeated Higgins 10–8 in the previous year's final. However, Yan lost 4–6 to Mark Williams in the first round. Neil Robertson defeated Barry Hawkins 10–4 in the final to win his second Masters title and his sixth Triple Crown title. He became the tenth player to win the Masters more than once. There were 26 century breaks, with the highest being a 139 made by Stuart Bingham in his first-round loss to Kyren Wilson.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is an invitational snooker tournament first held in 1975. Organised by the World Snooker Tour, the 2022 Masters was the 48th staging of the tournament. It was the second Triple Crown event of the 2021–22 snooker season, following the 2021 UK Championship and preceding the 2022 World Snooker Championship. Held between 9 and 16 January 2022, the event returned to the Alexandra Palace in London, after the 2021 event was held at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes to facilitate compliance with COVID-19 regulations. Matches were played as the best-of-11 until the final, which was the best-of-19 frames played over two . The event was sponsored for the first time by car retailer Cazoo, which replaced previous sponsor Betfred. The event's referees wore suits tailored by McCann Bespoke, as part of the London tailor's new partnership with the World Snooker Tour that is intended to restyle the appearance of referees and players.\nThe tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport, as well as by Eurosport in Europe. Worldwide, the event was covered by China Central Television and Superstars Online in China and Sky Sport in New Zealand. It was simulcast in Hong Kong by Now TV with additional commentary; DAZN covered the event across Canada, Brazil and the United States. In all other territories, the event was streamed by Matchroom Sport.\nParticipants.\nThe event featured the 16 players who were placed highest in the world rankings after the UK Championship in December 2021. The defending champion was Yan Bingtao, who won the 2021 Masters with a 10–8 victory over John Higgins in the final. Yan was seeded first for the event as defending champion. The next seven players in the world rankings were seeded and allocated fixed positions in the draw, with the remaining eight participants drawn randomly against them.\nBoth Higgins and Ronnie O'Sullivan took issue with the cutoff date for Masters eligibility, noting that the in-form Luca Brecel did not qualify even though he had entered the top 16 one week after the UK Championship by winning the 2021 Scottish Open. Zhao Xintong, who entered the top 16 for the first time after winning the UK Championship, made his Masters debut, the only player to do so at the 2022 event. The 2011 champion Ding Junhui, who made 15 consecutive Masters appearances between 2007 and 2021, fell out of the top 16 after the UK Championship and failed to qualify for the first time since he was 18 years old in 2006. Higgins made a record 28th appearance at the event, surpassing both Jimmy White and Steve Davis, who had both played at the Masters 27 times.\nPrize money.\nThe winner of the event won £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played between 9 and 12 January 2022 as the best-of-11 frames. In the opening afternoon's match, defending champion Yan faced two-time winner Mark Williams, who had lost in the first round in five of his six previous Masters appearances. Yan led 3–1 at the midsession interval, but Williams then won four consecutive frames to lead 5–3. Although Yan made a of 122 to win the ninth frame, Williams clinched the match 6–4 with an 85 break in the tenth. During the evening session, the 2012 champion Neil Robertson, who had lost in the first round on his last two Masters appearances, played Anthony McGill. The match began with a 12-minute before the first was made. McGill played strongly at the outset, winning the first frame with a break of 78 and making a in the third frame, but Robertson capitalised on his opponent's errors to win the second and fourth and then made a break of 95 in the fifth frame to lead 3–2. Although McGill tied the scores at 3–3 with a break of 75, Robertson won the next three frames to secure a 6–3 victory.\nThe following afternoon, two-time champion Higgins faced debutant Zhao. After Higgins had made a century break in the first frame, Zhao responded with a 128 in the second. Higgins then won three consecutive frames to lead 4–1, aided by another century break in the fifth frame. He closed out the match with a break of 78 to win 6–2. During the match, referee Jan Verhaas mistakenly the on the . This was rectified after a member of the audience let Verhaas know. In the evening, 2015 champion Shaun Murphy faced Barry Hawkins. Murphy took a 2–1 lead but Hawkins then rallied to win five consecutive frames for a 6–2 victory. Hawkins's win meant that he had defeated Murphy in all three of their Masters encounters, even though their overall head-to-head record was 10–4 in favour of Murphy. Commentators noted that Murphy appeared to be suffering from neck, shoulder and back problems during the match, which Murphy had stated were limiting his ability to practice and compete in tournaments.\nThe next afternoon, seven-time champion O'Sullivan played Jack Lisowski, with O'Sullivan's friend Ronnie Wood watching from the VIP seats. After O'Sullivan won the first frame, Lisowski responded with a century break to win the second. In the third frame, Lisowski missed a thin cut on the green to a corner pocket, allowing O'Sullivan to make a frame-winning break of 86. Lisowski later identified his missed green as a turning point in the match. O'Sullivan made another break of 63 to lead 3–1 at the midsession interval, after which he made a 127 clearance and further breaks of 64 and 125 to win the match 6–1. Lisowski's defeat meant that he had won just four frames in his three Masters appearances. In the evening, reigning world champion and three-time winner Mark Selby played Stephen Maguire. Selby won the 45-minute opening frame, and the players traded frames until the midsession interval, tying the scores at 2–2. The momentum shifted after the interval, with Selby winning four of the last five frames for a 6–3 victory.\nThe last two first-round matches both went to a . The 2019 champion Judd Trump, who had missed the previous year's event after testing positive for COVID-19, played the 2018 champion Mark Allen. Both players scored heavily in the opening frames, with Trump making two 101 breaks and Allen a 92. The match was tied at 2–2 at the midsession interval. After play resumed, Trump took the lead with a break of 88, but Allen won the next two frames to go 4–3 in front and looked like extending his lead in frame eight, as Trump with one red remaining. However, Allen failed to escape from a snooker and went , allowing Trump to clear the table and level at 4–4. A 135 break in the ninth frame gave Trump the lead once more, but Allen won a error-filled tenth frame to force the decider.

Wilson eventually potted the yellow and won the match 6–5.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals took place on 13 and 14 January as the best-of-11 frames. The quarter-finalists comprised six former champions — O'Sullivan, Williams, Higgins, Robertson, Trump and Selby — and two former runners-up — Hawkins, who lost to O'Sullivan in 2016, and Wilson, who lost to Allen in 2018. In the first quarter-final, Robertson began with 202 unanswered points against O'Sullivan, including a break of 119, to go 2–0 ahead. O'Sullivan then won the third and fourth frames to level at 2–2. Robertson won the fifth frame, before a 102 break by O'Sullivan, his 80th century break at the Masters. Robertson responded with a 130 break to win the seventh frame. A 68 break from O'Sullivan in the eighth frame tied the scores at 4–4 but Robertson then won two consecutive frames with breaks of 43, 49, and 54 to complete a 6–4 victory. Robertson noted the difficulty of competing at the Masters against O'Sullivan, commenting \"[O'Sullivan] gets the crowd behind him and you get 2,000 people absolutely screaming,\" but stated that his Masters debut against Jimmy White had taught him how to respond in such a situation.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Williams\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHiggins started his match against Williams with a 126 break in the first frame, and also won the second. Williams responded with three consecutive frames, including a 116 break in the third, to lead 3–2. Higgins leveled the match at 4–4 with a 127 break.

Higgins won the tenth frame, but Williams secured a 6–5 victory with a break of 91 to reach his first Masters semi-final since the 2010 event. Williams described the break he made in the deciding frame as \"one of the best of my career\".\nTrump won the first two frames against Wilson with breaks of 68 and 74.

Trump came from 45 points behind in the fifth frame to make a 76 and go 4–1 ahead. He won the sixth frame with a break of 67, and then closed out a 6–1 victory in the seventh frame. It was Trump's fifth consecutive victory over Wilson. Trump commented that he was \"devastated to miss this last year so I was determined to enjoy it this time\", whilst Wilson admitted that the \"better player on the day won\".\nThe final match of the quarter-finals saw Hawkins play Selby. Hawkins opened the match with a break of 58, and went to the midsession interval 3–1 ahead. Hawkins made a break of 65 in the next to lead by three frames. Hawkins also won frame six after Selby fouled and left a free ball, and won the match 6–1. Hawkins later commented that the scoreline \"flattered him\". Selby's highest break during the match was 49, and he described his performance as \"pathetic\". After the match, Selby commented that he had been struggling with mental health issues throughout the tournament. Fellow professional Gary Wilson praised Selby for speaking up about depression within the sport.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 15 January as the best-of-11 frames. Robertson met Williams in the first semi-final. Robertson made a century break to win the opening frame, but he trailed 1–3 at the interval. Robertson, however, made breaks of 83, 95 and 119 to win four of the next six to force a deciding frame. Helped by a , Williams led by 67 points to 26 in the decider with one red remaining on the table, meaning that Robertson required two . After the black ball covered the pocket, with the last red close to the black, Robertson was able to obtain the first of the snookers he required. When playing the yellow ball, Williams misjudged a , hitting the green ball and giving away another four foul points. Robertson then the table to win the match 6–5. After the match, Robertson called the comeback \"the greatest\" of his career. The World Snooker Tour ranked the match as number one on its \"Top Ten Matches of 2022\" list.\nHawkins played Trump in the second semi-final. Hawkins won the opening frame after a prolonged safety battle, but Trump levelled the scores with a break of 86. Trump also won frame three with a 63 break before Hawkins won the next two frames to lead 3–2. After the fifth frame, the match was halted as one of the had fallen apart. Hawkins made a 124 break in the sixth frame, his second century of the tournament, before Trump won the next two frames to tie the scores at 4–4. Trump made a break of 54 to lead for the first time in the match, but Hawkins won the tenth frame to force a decider, which he won with a break of 58. This was the twelfth meeting between the two players, with each having won six.\nFinal.\nThe final was played as the best-of-19 frames, held over two sessions on 16 January between Robertson and Hawkins. The match was officiated by Desislava Bozhilova, who took charge of her first Triple Crown final. Hawkins won the opening frame but Robertson responded with breaks of 50 and 105 to win the next two. Hawkins took the fourth, tying the scores at 2–2 at the midsession interval. A turning point came in the fifth frame when Hawkins, on a break of 60, missed the last red, which would have left Robertson requiring a snooker. Hawkins then fouled the green with his sleeve during a safety battle over the red, leaving a free ball that allowed Robertson to clear the table and win the frame. Robertson also won the sixth frame with two 54 breaks to go two frames ahead for the first time at 4–2. Hawkins won the seventh, but Robertson made a break of 73 in the eighth and final frame of the session to maintain his two-frame advantage at 5–3.\nThe first two frames of the evening session were shared, as Robertson won the ninth with a break of 50 and Hawkins responded with a 69 in the tenth, his highest break of the match. Robertson then won four consecutive frames to clinch a 10–4 victory and his second Masters title. He became the tenth player to win the tournament more than once, following Alex Higgins, Cliff Thorburn, Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, Paul Hunter, Williams, O'Sullivan, John Higgins, and Selby. It was Robertson's sixth Triple Crown title, following his world title in 2010, his previous Masters victory in 2012, and his three UK Championship wins in 2013, 2015, and 2020. Robertson compiled two centuries and six other breaks of 50 or more in the final, while Hawkins made just two breaks over 50. Hawkins acknowledged that his performance in the final had been substandard, saying: \"I made too many mistakes today and you can't do that against someone like Neil because he's a wonderful player.\" Hawkins's defeat meant that he had lost all three Triple Crown finals he had reached, having previously been runner-up to O'Sullivan in the 2013 World Snooker Championship and the 2016 Masters.\nTournament draw.\nNumbers given on the left show the players' seedings in the tournament draw.

The Pioneers represented the University of Denver and were coached by David Carle, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Denver's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDenver came into the season with high expectations. From the start, however, nothing seemed to go right for the Pioneers. After the season's start was delayed, Denver joined the rest of the NCHC in Omaha, Nebraska for a condensed slate of games in December. The team started slow but looked like they were rounding into form in mid-December. Unfortunately, a theme for the entire season proved to be inconsistency. For most of the year the Pioneers couldn't string together a series of wins, or even strong performances, and they watched as their ranking fell every week until they left the top-20 altogether. By the end of the season Denver sat in the middle of the standings but was 3 games below .500.\nWhile there were some who still included the Pioneers as possible bubble teams, their losing record was a sizable impediment to the team playing in the NCAA Tournament. Denver's only probably road to the tournament was to win the NCHC Championship and the team responded well in the quarterfinals, overcoming a 2-goal deficit to upset tournament-bound Omaha. In the semis they faced #2 North Dakota and took a lead into the third period. The Hawks outplayed Denver in the frame but, as time went along, it appeared that Magnus Chrona might be able to shut out UND. It took North Dakota pulling their goaltender to give them enough firepower to break through and tie the game. In the overtime session, Denver never found their footing and were outshot 9–1 in less than nine minutes. The final goal came from a UND stick and ended the game as well as any chance Denver had to extend their season. This was Denver's first losing season in 21 years.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

The Tigers represented Colorado College and were coached by Mike Haviland, in his 7th season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Colorado College's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nColorado College began the season playing a series of games in Omaha, Nebraska. The team started poorly but improved when freshman goaltender Dominic Basse was moved into the starting role. After the initial glut of games in December, CC's record stood at 2–4–2 with the team looking like it could improve with their bevy of new players. After splitting a weekend with then-ranked Denver at the start of January, the offense fell apart. Over the final two months of the shortened season, the Tigers never scored more than 2 goals in a game and they won once in 14 games. The team still managed to finish above last place in the conference and almost levered their position into a shocking upset of St. Cloud State in the conference quarterfinals but the team's paltry offense could not keep them in the game and they weren't able to hold onto their lead.\nAfter the season, head coach Mike Haviland resigned from his position. The move wasn't surprising considering both the overall lack of success under his tenure and the virtually non-existent offense of this season.\nJake Begley, Jackson Ross and Casey Staum sat out the season\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Games played (most often abbreviated as G or GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested. In baseball, the statistic applies also to players who, before a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as \"ex ante\" substitutes, whether or not they play; however, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic does not extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even if he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. An outfielder (OF) is a person playing in one of the three defensive positions in baseball farthest from the batter, who are identified as the left fielder (LF), the center fielder (CF), and the right fielder (RF). An outfielder's duty is to try to catch long fly balls before they hit the ground or to quickly catch or retrieve and return to the infield any other balls entering the outfield. Outfielders normally play behind the six other members of the defense who play in or near the infield; unlike catchers and most infielders (excepting first basemen), who are virtually exclusively right-handed, outfielders can be either right- or left-handed. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the outfielders are assigned the numbers 7 (left field), 8 (center field), and 9 (right field).\nThe outfield positions are routinely regarded as being among the less physically demanding positions in baseball, largely due to the rarity of contact with opposing players and the longer reaction time possible after a ball is hit; long careers in the outfield have been common throughout major league history. Because game accounts and box scores often did not distinguish between the outfield positions, there has been some difficulty in determining precise defensive statistics before 1901; because of this, and because of the similarity in their roles, defensive statistics for the three positions are frequently combined. Ty Cobb is the all-time leader in major league games played as an outfielder with 2,934. Barry Bonds (2,874), Willie Mays (2,842), Rickey Henderson (2,826), Hank Aaron (2,760), Tris Speaker (2,698), and Lou Brock (2,507) are the only other outfielders to play in over 2,500 games in their careers; 55 players have appeared in more than 2,000 career games as outfielders.\nAs of November 2023, no active players are in the top 100 of career games played as an outfielder. The active leader is Andrew McCutchen in 106th with 1,768."

        "title": "Skeleton Knight in Another World",
        "text": " is a Japanese light novel series written by Ennki Hakari and illustrated by KeG. It began serialization online in October 2014 on the novel self-publishing website Shōsetsuka ni Narō. It was later acquired by Overlap, who have published ten volumes since June 2015 under their Overlap Novels imprint. A manga adaptation with art by Akira Sawano has been serialized online via Overlap's \"Comic Gardo\" website since February 2017 and has been collected in twelve \"tankōbon\" volumes. Both the light novel and manga are licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. An anime television series adaptation by Studio Kai and Hornets aired from April to June 2022.\nPlot.\nUpon awakening, an unnamed gamer finds himself in the avatar body and armor that he was using in his online game. Seeing his reflection in a river, he is shocked to discover that his appearance is that of a skeleton due to the special avatar skin『Skeleton』he used. In unfamiliar territory, the gamer decides that it would be best to hide his appearance by never removing his helmet and to search for inhabitants. Spying a band of bandits attacking a group at a distance and seeing they're about to rape two women, he springs into action and kills the brigands. The women introduce themselves as Lauren du Luvierte, a noblewoman, and Rita Farren, her maid. Using his game name, the knight introduces himself as Arc and agrees to escort the two ladies to the town of Luvierte. While he refuses a reward (to avoid meeting Lauren's father Viscount Buckle du Luvierte, as it would cause complications should the noble ask to see his face), he accepts a copper passport from Rita which will allow him easier passage through any city in the territory.\nNear the town of Diento, he dispatches a group of bandits who had attacked him. While exploring their cave hideout, he discovers a wounded green-furred cottontailed fox (\"ventu vulpis\") imprisoned in a cage. Freeing the creature, he heals its wound with magic and befriends it. The fox indicates that it wants to travel with him, and he names it \"Ponta\".\nLater, Arc encounters a male elf outside Diento and learns about the human trade in capturing and enslaving elves. The elf is surprised that Ponta (which he refers to as a \"spirit creature\") is so attached to Arc and that Arc doesn't seem to share the fear and prejudice against elves that most humans in this world seem to have.\nSome time afterwards, Arc stumbles across two elf soldiers, one male and one female, battling a band of human slavers; when their leader uses the captured elf children as hostages, the female elf seems ready to surrender when Arc intervenes and helps the elves wipe out the slavers. After Ponta's presence convinces the elves that Arc is a friend and the captured elves are freed and healed of their wounds by Arc's magic, the female elf, Ariane Glenys Maple, hires Arc to help her free other enslaved elves being held in Diento itself. Meeting up with Danka, another elf soldier who has been scouting inside Diento for information (and the one whom Arc had encountered earlier), the three invade the slave warehouse. During their initial search, Arc encounters a catgirl ninja, who gives him information about humans involved in the slave trade and about other captured elves being held in the local lord's castle. After freeing the captured elves, Arc uses Teleportation magic to get them all away from Diento, then he and Ariane head for the castle while Danka escorts the freed elves home. After they free the two female elves (who then \"punish\" their captor/tormentor in a particularly gruesome fashion) and escape, Ariane asks Arc to accompany her back to their lands. Arc is reluctant and shows why by removing his helmet, revealing his skeletal form. While initially shocked, Ariane realizes that, despite his appearance, Arc is not evil but under a curse, and promises that the elves will keep his secret.\nAt the elvish settlement of Lalatoya, Arc meets and is welcomed by Elder Dillan and his wife Glenys, who are also Ariane's parents. At a meeting of Elders in the elvish capital city of Maple, at which the information about human Nobles being involved in the slave trade and the clear violation of the Elf-Human peace treaty is discussed, it is decided that while no direct retaliation against the humans will be made, the secret operations to free elf slaves will continue. Dillan offers to hire Arc to continue helping Ariane, and as payment provides him with information about a magic pool in Dragon Lord country that may lift his skeleton curse. Arc agrees, and he and Ariane, with Ponta, begin their quest to free the captured/enslaved elves and totally end the slave trade. They are joined in their mission by Chiyome, the ninja Arc had previously encountered and a member of the Jinshin Clan of beast people, who is engaged on a similar mission to free her fellow beast people who have likewise been captured and enslaved by humans. \nMeanwhile in Olav, the capital city of the Rhoden Kingdom, King Karlon, who, thanks to the events in Diento, has learned of the possible involvement of nobility in the slave trade in elves, dispatches his daughter Yuriarna on a diplomatic mission to the Grand Duchy of Limbult (which trades with the elves and where his older daughter Seriarna is the ruler's wife) to arrange a meeting with the elves. However, her older brothers Sekt and Dakares both have ambitions to inherit the throne and are vying with other for power. Yuriarna suspects Dakares of being involved in the slave trade and Sekt of knowing about it but trying to use it for his own advantage...and that both will stop at nothing to achieve their goals, even if it means eliminating anyone in their way (a fact proven when Sekt has Dakares assassinated and then frames him for the attempted murder of Yuriarna).\nAs Arc, Ariane and Chiyome's quest progresses and they gain friends and allies while traveling to different kingdoms across the world, they learn that the slave trade is merely the tip of the iceberg and that the Holy East Revlon Kingdom, ruled by the ruthless Emperor Domitianus, and this world's main religion, the Holy Hilk Kingdom, may be behind all the evil they're fighting to overcome.\nMedia.\nLight novel.\nThe light novel series is written by Ennki Hakari with illustrations by KeG, and has been published by Overlap under Overlap Novels imprint since June 25, 2015. As of May 2021, the series is still ongoing with 10 volumes released. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed the series on September 20, 2018, and released the first volume on June 11, 2019.\nManga.\nIn February 2017, the first chapter of the manga adaptation by Akira Sawano was published in Overlap's \"Comic Gardo\"; though Akira is the author of the manga series, character designs are credited to KeG. Overlap collected the individual chapters into \"tankōbon\" volumes; the first volume was released in August 2017. In September 2018, Seven Seas Entertainment announced its licensing of the manga series for localization in North America under the title \"Skeleton Knight in Another World\".\nAnime.\nAn anime television series adaptation was announced on April 17, 2021. The series will be animated by Studio Kai and Hornets and directed by Katsumi Ono, with Takeshi Kikuchi supervising the series' scripts, Tōru Imanishi designing the characters, and eba and Tsubasa Ito composing the series' music. It aired from April 7 to June 23, 2022, on AT-X, Tokyo MX, SUN, and BS11. The opening theme song is \"Aa, Waga Roman no Michi Yo\" (嗚呼、我が浪漫の道よ, \"Ah, My Romantic Road\") by PelleK, while the ending theme song is \"Bokura ga Oroka da Nante Dare ga Itta\" (僕らが愚かだなんて誰が言った, \"Who Called Us Fools?\") by DIALOGUE+. Crunchyroll has licensed the series outside of Asia. Muse Communication announced the license for South and Southeast Asia the day after the anime announcement.\nOn April 11, 2022, Crunchyroll announced that the series would receive an English dub, which premiered on April 28."

        "text": "The 2020–21 St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey season was the 86th season of play for the program, the 24th at the Division I level and the 8th in the NCHC conference. The Huskies represented St. Cloud State University and were coached by Brett Larson, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of St. Cloud State's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nRegular season.\nDue to ongoing COVID-19 concerns, St. Cloud joined the rest of the NCHC in Omaha, Nebraska for the first three weeks of the season. The Huskies started well, winning their first three matches and used some of the games to give their backup netminders a turn in goal. From the beginning, however, Dávid Hrenák was the team's go-to goalie. He helped the team swiftly climb into the top-20 and provided the team with the needed support to overcome then-number-one North Dakota. The win put St. Cloud on the map and by the end of the NCHC's Omaha bubble, the Huskies were in the top-10.\nSt. Cloud got a chance to prove they were worthy of their ranking with four consecutive games against #4 Minnesota Duluth. The Huskies lost the first match but then won three in a row and jumped into the top-5. Aside from the honor of being ranked so highly after beginning the season unranked, the Huskies were guaranteed a spot in the NCAA tournament if they could maintain their position. Unfortunately, the very next weekend they were swept by Western Michigan. The losses didn't cost STC too much, since the NCHC is typically regarded as the best conference in college hockey (St. Cloud only fell two spots).\nSt. Cloud went through a bit of a rough patch in February, splitting series against two teams with losing records, and found themselves in a race for second place with UMD. The two ended the regular season with a home-and-home series over two weekends and when the Bulldogs took the first game they were just one point behind St. Cloud in the standings. The Huskies jumped out to a huge lead in their final regular season game, leading 3–0 after 20 minutes, but Duluth fought back in the final two periods to tie the game. Not wanting to let Duluth have a chance, Easton Brodzinski scored the winning goal just 17 seconds into overtime, giving the Huskies the second seed.\nNCHC Tournament.\nWith the entire conference tournament being played at the Ralph Engelstad Arena, there was no home advantage for the Huskies, but the team was able to avoid playing Western Michigan in the quarterfinals (WMU had won the season series 2–4). Instead, St. Cloud was nearly overcome by a tremendous performance by Colorado College's Matt Vernon. STC outshout CC 44–7 in the game but still found themselves down as the second period wound down. Vernon only allowed two goals while his team was completely outplayed and St. Cloud never took the pressure off. The Tigers couldn't even get a shot on goal in the third and the Huskies' oppressive defense carried them to the victory. In the semifinal, St. Cloud met Minnesota Duluth for the seventh time that season. The two teams fought a mostly even first period but STC carried a 2–1 lead. The Huskies dominated the middle frame, outshooting the Bulldogs 18–6, but the teams exchanged goals to leave St. Cloud with a 1-goal lead after 40 minutes. St. Cloud put up a defensive wall in the third and were able to hold UMD off of the scoresheet to win the game and head to the title match.\nThe Huskies were once again able to play well in the first two periods, leading 2–1 after one and then pushing the pace in the second. Unfortunately for St. Cloud, North Dakota possessed a far better offense than Duluth and when the Fighting Hawks got some power play opportunities in the third they took full advantage. UND scored three times in just over two minutes to take the lead and then added an empty-net goal to down the Huskies 5–3.\nNCAA tournament.\nThe second-place finish resulted in St. Cloud State being ranked 7th by the NCAA selection committee and the team received was set to face Boston University in the regional semifinals. The first period was marked by BU killing off a 5-minute major penalty and, when the Terriers opened the scoring 8 seconds into the second, it appeared that it may be their night. St. Cloud continued to pile shots on goal and were finally able to break through after the half-way point of the game. Once the Huskies broke through a wave of goals followed; four goals were scored in less than four minutes, three from St. Cloud State, and the Huskies found themselves up 3–2 entering the third. Chase Brand took a major penalty for elbowing Jay O'Brien in the head and gave BU a chance to get back into the game. Instead, Jami Krannila wound up scoring on a penalty shot less than a minute later and the goal from St. Cloud seemed to take the steam out of the Terriers. The penalty ended without another goal and Hrenák held BU scoreless in the third while the Huskies scored twice more to run away with a 6–2 win.\nIn their second game the Huskies met Boston College, who had been advanced due to the forced withdrawal of Notre Dame. despite coming in cold, BC scored first and led after one but, for the fifth consecutive game, St. Cloud was an absolute terror in the second period. The Huskies outshot Boston College 20–7 and reeled off three goals to take a commanding lead. The defense proved stout once again and held the Eagles scoreless over the final 45 minutes of the game to send St. Cloud State to their second Frozen Four since joining Division I in 1987. Unfortunately for St. Cloud, not everything had turned up roses. the team's leading goal scorer, Easton Brodzinski, broke his femur in the game and would miss the team's Frozen Four run.\nFrozen Four.\nTwo weeks later the Huskies opened the Frozen Four as one of three Minnesota teams and faced the highest-remaining seed, Minnesota State. After exchanging power play markers, St. Cloud took a 2–1 lead into the second period. The Huskies increased their lead to two less than three minutes into the middle frame, but this game saw the Huskies' script change. MSU came charging back in the second, more than doubling St. Cloud's shot total, and scored twice in the second half of the period to tie the game. The Mavericks then scored early in the third to take the lead and looked to have all the momentum, but St. Cloud was able to fight back. After tying the score with under 10 minutes to play, St. Cloud fought a mostly even duel with Minnesota State for the rest of the game but, with less than a minute to play, Nolan Walker deflected a point shot over the shoulder of Dryden McKay and put the Huskies ahead. They were able to hold off the Mavericks in the final few second and reached the program's first ever championship game.\nIn the title game, St. Cloud got off to a slow start against Massachusetts, recording only 3 shots in the first period. While the Huskies found themselves down by just a goal as the first neared its end, there was a bit of controversy when a UMass player grabbed the puck and threw it out of his defensive zone. On replay it appeared to be worth of a delay-of-game penalty but nothing was called. Shortly thereafter, the Minutemen scored their second goal of the game on what was likely an offside play. Despite the referees reviewing the goal, it was allowed to stand and the St. Cloud team was livid. The Huskies were able to calm down during intermission and came out firing in the third. After getting their second power play opportunity, the team had a chance to climb back into the game. Instead, the Huskies were caught after a bad turnover and Philip Lagunov put UMass ahead by 3 after a highlight-reel goal. The short-handed marker left many of St. Cloud's players with slumped shoulders. Before the period was out the Minutemen scored again on their own power play and essentially put the game out of reach. While it can't be known what difference the missed calls in the first or the absence of Brodzinski made, Massachusetts was the better team throughout the game and St. Could would have to wait for another year.\nTrevor Zins sat out the season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | "

        "text": "The 2020–21 Bowling Green Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 52nd season of play for the program and the 8th in the WCHA conference. The Falcons represented Bowling Green State University and were coached by Ty Eigner, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAs a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic the entire college ice hockey season was delayed. Because the NCAA had previously announced that all winter sports athletes would retain whatever eligibility they possessed through at least the following year, none of Bowling Green's players would lose a season of play. However, the NCAA also approved a change in its transfer regulations that would allow players to transfer and play immediately rather than having to sit out a season, as the rules previously required.\nDespite COVID concerns, Bowling Green was able to play several non-WCHA teams early in the year and propelled themselves into the top-10 with a fantastic start. The Falcons won 12 of their first 13 games, including an impressive series sweep of Quinnipiac, and rose to the #5 ranking by mid-January. Unfortunately, when Bowling Green began facing stiff competition, the offense dropped off dramatically. Over a 4-week stretch, the Falcons went 2–6, losing the six games against teams that finished the season ranked. In those games the team scored just 6 goals. While the defense wasn't particularly bad, it wasn't good either. Bowling Green recovered with a 3–0–1 run to end the season but the damage had been done.\nEven with a 19–8–1 record, the Falcons had fallen to 13th in the rankings and were considered a 'bubble team', since they possessed a 1–7 record against the other top teams in the WCHA. To get themselves an NCAA Tournament bid, the team would need a good performance in their conference tournament. BG got off to a bad start, losing the opening game 3–4 to Northern Michigan, but rebounded with resounding 5–0 win. The turnaround didn't last long, however, and the Falcons dropped the deciding game 1–5. The team was ranked 16th the following poll and were passed over in favor of Notre Dame, who were just 1 game over .500.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Former hockey player Shaun Reagan has served as head coach since the 2011-12 season.\nThe Warriors have won the McCaw Cup once, in 2024. They have made one appearance at the U Sports National Championship in 2024, finishing in fourth place. The Warriors are also set to host and appear at the 2025 National Championship at the Woolwich Memorial Centre in Elmira, Ontario.\nHistory.\nBill Antler era.\nJoining the OUA conference in the 2002-03 season, having formerly been as a club team at the university, the Warriors were led by head coach Bill Antler. His coaching staff for the inaugural season included assistant coaches Roger McKenzie and Mike Cinelli. Serving as the first captain in Warriors history, Lindsay Wood played for the program until 2005, part of a foundation of competitive players including Sarah McNaught and Lindsay Wood. Finishing fourth in the OUA Western Division for their inaugural season, the club finished ahead of the Western Mustangs, who would become one of their biggest rivals. \nMike Kadar era.\nDuring the 2005-2006 season, the Warriors clinched their first playoff berth under interim head coach Mike Kadar. Having also served as the Strength and Conditioning Coach for the NHL’s Los Angeles Kings, Kadar joined the Warriors due to the NHL Player Lockout. Facing the Brock Badgers in their first-ever playoff series, the Warriors were unable to qualify for the next round. \nGeraldine Heaney era.\nWith Kadar returning to the Kings the next autumn, the 2005-2006 season featured a new head coach. Winter Games gold medalist Geraldine Heaney, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, took the reins, with a coaching staff that included Mike Stankowitsch, Jerry Harrigan and Bradi Cochrane. Heaney stepped down from the role in May 2011.\nShaun Reagan era.\nFollowing the 2011 season, the Warriors hired former OHL player and schoolteacher Shaun Reagan, a lifelong resident of Waterloo who had been the inaugural coach of the Kitchener-Waterloo Rangers of the OWHA since 2008.\nFollowing several years of consistent regular season success and OUA playoff appearances following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Warriors' most successful season came in 2023-24 when they defeated the Laurier Golden Hawks and York Lions in the quarter and semi-finals of the OUA playoffs, advancing to the McCaw Cup final and granting them a spot in the U Sports National Championship for the first time. In the OUA final, the Warriors faced defending provincial champions Toronto at Varsity Arena, defeating them on the road 2-1 in overtime to win their first provincial championship in program history.\nExternal links.\n "
