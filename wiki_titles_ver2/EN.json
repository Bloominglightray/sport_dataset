From 1996–2002 the selections were made by Student Sports and from 2003–2009 by EA Sports. From 2010–2012 the award was determined by \"ESPN HS\" until the award was taken over and executed by Flores in 2013 after his tenure with ESPN ended.\nAccording to information posted online by \"Ballislife\", \"Selections are based on high school accomplishment, not future college/pro potential, and are reflective of those that lead their teams to state championships. \"Ballislife\" does not knowingly select fifth-year players, and those ineligible due to age or academics, Mr. Basketball USA or to its various All-American teams.\" Furthermore, selection uses \"on-the-floor performance\" without regard to academics, volunteer work or most other off-the-court criteria.\nCurrent selections are made through a season-long polling process of a 10-member expert panel with a final year-end ballot to determine the winner. The panel includes five McDonald's All-American selection committee members. The panel is polled weekly for a list of the top seven national player of the year candidates regardless of graduating class. The votes are then translated into a 10-point scoring system, with 10 points for a first-place vote, nine points for second-place vote, and down to four points for a seventh-place vote.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "Gravesend Cricket Club",
        "text": "Gravesend Cricket Club is a cricket club which currently plays in Division 1 of the Kent Cricket League. The club was formed in 1881 when the Harkaway and Clarence Cricket Clubs were amalgamated to form the Gravesend Cricket Club. The club continues to play at the Bat and Ball Ground which has itself been around for over 150 years (since 1848). First Class Cricket was played at \"The Bat\" (as it is affectionately known) by Kent County Cricket Club and its Second XI. The highest ever score on the ground came from W.G.Grace with 257 for Gloucestershire in 1895, and the most wickets in a match coming from Tich Freeman for Kent in 1931. The club currently has four running league teams, as well as a 5th XI which play friendly matches. Also, the club operates an exciting youth section with teams ranging from U10 to U19. In Autumn 2011, the club was awarded the ECB \"Clubmark\" status which acknowledges the colts section of the club.\nCricket Grounds used by Gravesend Cricket Club.\nThere are two different grounds that are used every week during the season by the four operating league sides and two grounds that are used occasionally by the Sunday sides. The Fifth XI play all of their games away, apart from one game which is annually played at The Bat &amp; Ball against Detling CC. These grounds are:\n2010 season.\nIn the 2010 season, the First XI was pushing for promotion from Division 3 of the Kent Cricket League and after a brilliant season, were promoted as champions. No doubt, the club were very grateful from the help of Jamaica national cricket team player Yannick Elliott who got 37 wickets and 588 runs during the campaign as the club's overseas player. The rest of the 1st XI were also brilliant during the season altogether (including Yannick Elliott) accumulating 137 wickets and 2873 runs.\n2011 season.\nThe 2011 season was going to show to be a tough season in Division 2 for the First XI. However, the club managed 4 wins in the first 6 games of the season and were comfortably out of the relegation zone, sitting in the top half of the table. Despite this they went on to lose their next 6 games whilst two were abandoned. They avoided relegation by managing to win two out of the last four games and as a result, they finished 7th in the league with 167 points, 13 points above the relegation zone.\nDecember 2011 was to prove to be a great month for the club - despite it being during the off season. This was due to the club being granted £43,214 by the Sport England's Olympic Legacy Fund. This money was spent on new outdoor nets, a roller, a bowling machine and a new cover for the club to use at the Bat &amp; Ball. All of these things will contribute massively, no doubt, to the growth of the club as a whole and will pave a better path for the club's up-and-coming youth players. Also, it was great news for the club when they found out that newly appointed Assistant Coach of Essex County Cricket Club, Matthew Walker, would be coaching the winter nets sessions for the club. Matt is an ex-player for the club having played there for 13 years as a youth and adult.\n2012 season.\nThe 2012 season ended up being a good season for the club especially for the 2nd XI who managed to gain promotion to the Kent 2nd XI Division 2. They did it in the last game of the season and were promoted by a single point. Elsewhere in the club, the 1st XI remained in Division 2 of the Kent League, the 3rd XI remained in Division 1A Central of the Kent Regional League, and the 4th XI were relegated from Division 2B West of the Kent Regional League. However, the 4th XI did win in their final game of the season against the Hartley Country CC 5th XI. Ironically, the win relegated Hartley as well.\n2018 season.\nLeague Positions\n Batting \n Bowling \n Fielding \n Colts Cricket \n2019 season.\nLeague Positions\nBatting\nBowling\nFielding\n Colts Cricket "

In 1996, the club withdrew from Odense Boldklub and founded the independent tennis club, operating under its current name since 2007.\nTennis Club Odense is a member of Funen Tennis Association (FTU) and the Danish Tennis Association (DTF), the governing bodies of Funen and Danish lawn tennis, respectively. It has 13 outdoor courts (12 of which are clay courts), but despite being the largest tennis club in Denmark's third largest city, it has had no permanent indoor courts since 2004. Since 2007, however, members of Tennis Club Odense have played indoor tennis in the club's temporary facilities in a local warehouse. Nonetheless, the local authorities have promised building six indoor courts before 2014.\nInternationally, the club has hosted the annual ITF Junior Outdoor Cup Odense since 2010, and throughout the 1990s, the club also hosted Funen Open, a major tournament on the ITF Men's Circuit. In 2008, Tennis Club Odense played a major role in organizing of the 2008 Nordea Danish Open – the forerunner for the annual Danish WTA tournament in Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDespite being born in Odense, the former world no. 1 on the WTA Tour, Caroline Wozniacki, has never played for or in Tennis Club Odense. Nevertheless, the most successful Danish male tennis player of the 2000s, Kristian Pless, started his career in the club. On a national level, Tennis Club Odense is one of the most successful Danish tennis clubs, winning the bronze medal at the Danish Team Championship in 2009.\nHistory.\nTennis Club Odense is the oldest tennis club on Funen. In 1894, the first permanent clay courts were placed near Munke Mose, a local swamp in Odense. In 1933, the construction of indoor facilities was finished, but ten years later, the facilities burned down. There was not found a replacement until 1964. Although the new indoor facilities were quickly considered obsolete, the two indoor courts surrounded by a primitive plastic cloth were in operation until 2004, when they were completely worn down.\nIn 1996, the tennis department decided to withdraw from Odense Boldklub (OB), one of the most successful Danish football clubs of all time. The departure was seen as a reaction to the primitive indoor facilities and the fact that the club had little ability in attracting its own sponsors. From 1996 to 2006, the tennis club was known as OB Tennis.\nTennis Team Fyn, an extensive talent development project, was launched in 2004 by Tennis Club Odense and other local partners in order to generate more talented young tennis players on Funen.\nIn 2007, the tennis club changed its name to Tennis Club Odense."

Eszter Pécsi, Hungary's first female architect and structural engineer, designing the articulated reinforced concrete arches. The outdoor swimming pool and the diving facility were completed in 1937, since then they have expanded and improved several times.\nRecently the facility was renovated before the 2006 European Championship, with an additional outdoor 50-meter pool and diving pool, named after Tamás Széchy. This brought the total number of indoor and outdoor pools up to 8 including an international standard diving platform for professional and amateur athletes.\nThe Hajós Alfréd National Sports Club has hosted many world competitions and regularly hosts international water polo tournaments.\nThe venue was the home of the European Aquatics Championships in 2006 and 2010 and the 2014 Men's European Water Polo Championship and 2014 Women's European Water Polo Championship competitions."

        "text": "Yan Kit Swimming Complex, located along Yan Kit Road, was the second public swimming pool in Singapore, opening in 1952 and closing in April 2001. The complex cost a total of $513,000 (as of 1952) and pool users had to pay fifteen cents per entry. The complex closed due to a daily attendance of only 120 users by 2001.\nHistory.\nOriginally constructed as a filter tank for the Water Department, it was closed down during the Japanese occupation and had its plant removed. It was then refitted and rebuilt in December 1949 as Yan Kit Swimming Complex. Built by the City Council for $513,000, it was officially opened by then Governor of Singapore, John Nicoll and City Council president, T.P.F. McNeice on 29 December 1952. It was named after a Canton-born dentist Look Yan Kit who came to Singapore in 1877 and was involved in the founding of the Kwong Wai Shiu Free Hospital in 1910. The pools first supervisor was Lee Hong Ming, who was a founding member of the Singapore Life Guard Corps and had served as pool supervisor at the Mount Emily Swimming Complex.\nIn 1994, the National Trades Union Congress Club announced plans to lease the pool and redevelop it part of its new clubhouse at a cost of $6 million, but it never materialised.\nIn April 2001, Singapore Sports Council (SSC) decided to close the pool and return it to the state because attendance had dwindled to an average of 120 daily and it was becoming too expensive to maintain. The foundation of the pools had deteriorated, making spot repairs ineffective. SSC estimated that it would cost S$400,000 to maintain and operate the complex annually and S$4 million to upgrade the entire complex.\nIn a move to give new life to old sports facilities, the SSC announced in 2005 that the complex was opened for possible development by private developers. These plans, too, never materialised.\nEventually, in 2011, the site was levelled and grassed in preparation for handover to the Singapore Land Authority. The process will be complete by April 2012.\nDesign.\nThe complex, which occupies a 14,859-sq-m plot of land was built on an old railway site off Cantonment Road and contains three pools, a single-storey clubhouse and three other buildings which house toilets and showers. The pools were lined up in a row with diving platforms at one end and a lifeguard watchtower cum slide between two of the pools.\nSignificance.\nWhen it first opened, pool users had to pay 15 cents per entry. According to a former pool supervisor, the complex was so popular that there was only standing room and a two-hour limit was imposed on swimmers. On Tuesdays, the pool was opened only to women and girls who were too shy to appear in their bathing suits in front of men.\nBefore Yan Kit Swimming Complex, Singapore only had one other public swimming facility at the Mount Emily Swimming Complex that was built in the 1930s, which has also since been demolished.\nFurther reading.\nTroubled waters: Yan Kit &amp; River Valley Swimming Complexes.

The rugby union team currently plays in Primera División B, the second division of the URBA league system. Founded in 2009, Delta is the newest rugby club taking part in the union tournaments.\nHistory.\nAfter rugby union was introduced at the club San Fernando played at the highest level of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires championship until 2009, when after disputing the Top14 of Torneo de la URBA the club punished five players of the first division, banning them for periods from three months to two years. Due to that suspension the club could not play the seven tournament.\nThe banned players left San Fernando to establish a new club, so \"Delta Rugby Club\" was founded on 19 November 2009 and started to play at Grupo IV, the lowest division of the Unión de Rugby de Buenos Aires.\nWith a team dismantled because of the exodus of its most notable players one year before, San Fernando made a poor campaign in the 2010 championship and was relegated to Grupo II (the second division) where it currently plays.\nDelta RC played its home games in a field property of Club San Patricio until 2011, when the club opened its own facilities, which included a field. The installations are located in Rincón de Milberg, a division of Tigre Partido.\nIn 2013, Delta promoted to the first división when only four years had passed since its foundation. The team achieved its goal after defeating San Albano by 42–27."

        "text": "Kevin Young (born November 17, 1981) is an American basketball coach and former player who is head coach of the Brigham Young University (BYU) Cougars men’s basketball team. Prior to joining the Cougars, he was an associate head coach with the Phoenix Suns and an assistant coach with the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Young’s first head coaching job was in Ireland's Super League with the Shamrock Rovers Hoops. He later served as head coach for six seasons in the NBA Development League (now known as the NBA G League) with the Utah Flash, Iowa Energy, and Delaware 87ers. At the college level, Young was an assistant coach at Oxford College and Utah Valley State College (UVSC).\nPlaying career.\nYoung's own basketball career started in Marietta, Georgia, where he played high school basketball at Sprayberry High School under Coach Roger Kvam. After high school, Young attended Middle Georgia College, a NJCAA establishment. After 2 years, he transferred to Clayton State University, a Division II university, where he was considered a standout guard.\nCoaching career.\nAfter finishing his collegiate career, he made his professional head coaching debut at age 23 in Oxford, Georgia with Oxford College. He then headed to Orem, Utah as an assistant coach under Dick Hunsaker at UVSC during the 2005-06 season. He then traveled to Dublin, Ireland with the Shamrock Rovers Hoops in the country's Super League. Returning to the U.S. after one season, he joined the NBA D-League as an assistant coach for the Utah Flash for a season under coach Brad Jones.\nIn 2010, Young was promoted to head coach of the Utah Flash. In that season, he led the team to a record of 28–22, including a 9-game winning streak, before losing to the eventual champion Iowa Energy 2–1 in the first round of the playoffs. After Nick Nurse left the Energy, the team named Young their new head coach for 2011. He coached the Energy for the next two seasons, having an average record the first season and losing in the first round to the Los Angeles D-Fenders (now the South Bay Lakers), before having a worse record the second season and being subsequently fired after starting with a 6–17 record. Young was then named an assistant coach for the Delaware 87ers (now Delaware Blue Coats), the re-branded team name of the Utah Flash, for a season. He was later meant to be a player development coach for the 87ers before the promotion of head coach Rod Baker to scout for the Philadelphia 76ers led to Young being promoted back to head coach for the newly re-branded franchise. For the next three seasons, there were incremental improvements with the 87ers, going from 20 wins to 21 wins to 26 wins throughout his second coaching tenure with the franchise. However, he was also instrumental for not just helping Thanasis Antetokounmpo get drafted in the 2014 NBA draft, but also seeing four different players scoring season-highs of at least 45 points throughout his second season, with Christian Wood and Jordan McRae growing to be capable NBA players in their careers not long after.\nOn August 4, 2016, Young was promoted to the role of assistant coach for the Philadelphia 76ers. Outside of an injury plagued first season with the 76ers, in each season afterward, he helped get the 76ers into the playoffs for at least the first round, with highlight appearances in the second round in 2018 and 2019. After Brett Brown was fired in 2020, Young interviewed for the open head coach position before it was ultimately filled by Doc Rivers.\nOn October 9, 2020, Young was named assistant coach of the Phoenix Suns, reuniting with head coach Monty Williams after a season together as assistant coaches with the 76ers. In his first season with Phoenix, he not only helped the team reach the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2010, but also reach the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993. On August 7, 2021, Young was promoted to the role of associate head coach of the Suns. In his first year as associate head coach, Young became the Suns' acting head coach for a four game stretch in late December and early January, while Monty Williams was in health and safety protocols. Following Young's four game stint as acting head coach, Chris Paul said, \"\"He did a great job...KY will be a head coach very soon in this league.\" \nIn May 2022, Young was featured in ESPN's annual report on potential coaching candidates to watch. The article stated when talking about Young, \"If it's alignment you're looking for, Suns associate head coach Kevin Young is a natural fit. Both the Suns' basketball ops crew and head coach Monty Williams regard Young as an essential hub to share ideas across the organization. It's a logical role for a young coach who excels at both listening and communicating. Young served as a head coach in the G League for six seasons, which gave him a foundation as an organizer and big-picture thinker. He has earned the respect of players with his work ethic and candor. He was a finalist for the Washington job last spring, where his sharpness impressed.\" Young has since been interviewed for head coaching positions with the Houston Rockets, Toronto Raptors, and Milwaukee Bucks, as well as the Phoenix Suns following the report's release.\nOn June 3, 2023, Young was given a five-year contract extension worth $10 million with the Phoenix Suns, making him the highest-paid assistant coach in the NBA after finishing as the runner-up for the open head coach position for them. He remained in the associate head coach role with the team, with Frank Vogel being the Suns' newest head coach.\nOn April 16, 2024, Young was named the head coach at BYU, filling the vacancy left by the departure of Mark Pope. He will join BYU following the conclusion of the Suns' 2024 NBA playoff run.\nPersonal life.\nYoung is married to Melissa Bailey of Omaha, Nebraska; they have two sons and one daughter. He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."

        "text": "In Australia, archery is a sport in which men and women compete against each other on an equal playing field. Coed competitions have occurred since Australia's colonial era. An example of one such competition took played in Yandilla, Queensland, in 1878. Women's archery was established in Victoria by the 1870s, mostly in archery clubs. People viewed women's archery as a royal sport during this era and they encouraged women to participate because it did not require women to give up their womanhood in order to compete. Women were members of an archery club in Adelaide by 1870.\nArchery became part of the women's physical education curriculum during the 1880s. The largest area to adopt this sport in the curriculum was in Victoria at schools like MLC Kew, which borrowed heavily from a British sporting tradition.\nIn 1932, the Australian branch National Council of the YWCA sent questionnaires to individual branches asking the branches what sports they preferred to participate in. Archery was one of the sports women indicated interest in. The Adelaide branch cited archery and said participation in this and other sports taught girls loyalty, \"fair play, co-operation, friendliness, unselfishness, self-control and doggedness.\"\nAt the 1982 Commonwealth Games held in Brisbane, new women's sports were included on the programming including archery and lawn bowls.\nCassie McCall (Woods) won the bronze medal for women's individual compound at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Dehli.\nElisa Barnard competed at the London 2012 Olympic Games, one of two archers to representing Australia.\nAustralian women have been awarded scholarships for archery at the Australian Institute of Sport. They include Jade Beatty who held a scholarship from 2001 to 2002, Deonne Bridger who held a scholarship from 1997 to 2000 and Mary Chidlow who held a scholarship in 1998. Australian women on scholarship are based in Canberra."

Watkins was capped ten times for Wales and played club rugby for Ebbw Vale RFC and Cardiff RFC. He also played invitational rugby for the Barbarians.\nHistory.\nWatkins was educated at Glyncoed Comprehensive and Ebbw Vale Senior Comprehensive where he played at scrum-half and centre. He began his club career with RTB Ebbw Vale Youth RFC where he swapped his position to hooker. Whilst still playing youth rugby he moved to Ebbw Vale RFC senior team. He was first selected for the Wales international team during the 1988 Five Nations Championship, coming on as a replacement. His first starting international came two weeks later when he faced Scotland at the National Stadium in Cardiff, in which Watkins scored his only international points with a try.\nIn total Watkins played ten internationals all between 1988 and 1989. After playing in all four games of the 1988 Championship, in which Wales won the Triple Crown, he was part of the Wales team that undertook a disastrous tour of New Zealand in the summer of that year. Watkins played in the first Test at Auckland, which New Zealand won 54-9. In December 1989 he was selected to face Romania on their tour of Great Britain. Wales lost 15-9. His final international games were all four games of the 1989 Five Nations Championship, Wales losing the first three opening games against Scotland, Ireland and France, before defeating England in the last encounter of the tournament. Troubled by injuries, Watkins found it difficult to challenge for the Wales hooker position later in his career."

The top six finishers in the regular season of the conference's nine baseball teams advance to the double-elimination tournament, whose most recent edition was held in 2023 at The Ballpark at Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the off-campus baseball home of the College of Charleston. The winner of the tournament receives an automatic berth to the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship.\nFormat.\nThe first CAA Tournament in 1986 was a four team double-elimination tournament, with the bottom three finishers not participating. From 1987 through 1993, all six teams participated in a double-elimination tournament. After Old Dominion joined the league in 1992, the last place team did not participate in tournament. The CAA adopted a seven team format in 1994, with the top seed getting a bye and playing the winner of the opening round game between the four and five seeds. This format was used until VCU joined the conference in 1996 and the league adopted a traditional 8 team double-elimination tournament. After the conference shakeup prior to the 2002 season, the league split into divisions and brought six teams to the tournament. The two division champions were automatically in the field as the top two seeds, and the top four remaining finishers were seeded three through six. This format lasted only two years, as discontinued baseball and the league dropped to nine teams and eliminated divisions. The six team format survived through the 2009 season, and the league used a four team format for 2010 and 2011. The six team format was adopted again in 2012 and maintained through 2019. In the aftermath of the cancellation of the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CAA decided to include all 9 teams in the tournament in 2021, with the bottom two seeds participating in a play-in game before the traditional double-elimination tournament.\nChampions.\nBy year.\nThe following is a list of conference champions and sites listed by year.\nBy school.\nThe following is a list of conference champions listed by school."

        "title": "UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros baseball",
        "text": "The UT Rio Grande Valley Vaqueros baseball team, or the UTRGV Vaqueros, is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, an NCAA Division I institution with several campuses in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, United States. UTRGV was formally founded in 2013 with the announced merger of the University of Texas–Pan American (UTPA), with its main campus in Edinburg, and the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) in Brownsville, with the merged university beginning operation in the 2015–16 school year. The Vaqueros compete in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), play home games at UTRGV Baseball Stadium in Edinburg, and are coached by Derek Matlock.\nPrior to the merger, UTPA competed in Division I as the Texas–Pan American Broncs, while UTB, a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, had no baseball program. In 2014, the University of Texas System announced that UTRGV would directly inherit the UTPA athletic program, including UTPA's WAC membership.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1955–1968).\nThe Broncs began play in 1955, with Jim Brooks (who had been athletic director since 1952) serving as head coach for the inaugural season. He led the Broncs to a 5–10 record. John Donnelly was hired prior to the next season, and he coached the team for two seasons, going 19–16. Red Connor took over in 1959, also coaching for just two seasons, going 24–15. Sam Williams (the coach for the basketball team) served as coach for the 1961 season, going 7–16. Earl Gartman, previously a coach for football and baseball at Howard (now known as Samford) was hired in 1962 (the same year that Pan-American had membership in both NAIA and NCAA Division II), coaching them for two seasons before leaving to serve as head coach for the high school football team at Los Fresnos, going 20–16.\nIn 1964, Chuck Young was hired to coach the team. In his first year, he led them to a 19–8 record while the team was invited to the NAIA playoffs. In the District 8 playoffs, they beat the University of Dallas in three games to advance to the Texas Championships against Sam Houston. They were swept in two games. The following year, he led them to a 16–10 record, with the team advancing to the playoffs once again. They swept Austin College and Texas Southern in two games each to advance to the Championships again. They were swept again by the Bearkats. The program began shifting to NCAA Division I along with the rest of the sports teams starting in 1965. In 1966, Larry Ensminger was hired to coach the team. He led them to winning seasons in each of his three years, with the last being an 18–12 season that led to the Broncs being invited to the 1968 NCAA University Division baseball tournament. They played Texas at the District 6 Finals in Austin, Texas. They were beaten in three games by the Longhorns.\nAl Ogletree era (1969–1997).\nIn 1969, Al Ogletree was hired by Brooks to coach the team, going 24–11 in his first season. In 1970, he led them to the 1970 NCAA University Division baseball tournament, where they beat Arkansas State to get to the District 6 Finals, where the Longhorns beat them in two games. The following year was the best for the team in overall success. They went 44–9 while going to the 1971 NCAA University Division baseball tournament for the second straight year. They swept the two-game series against Texas, beating them 1–0 and 4–0 to advance to the College World Series for the first time in school history. Although they lost their first game to Southern Illinois, they managed to win the next two games in the Loser's Bracket over Seton Hall and Harvard to reach the Semifinals. They were beaten 8–6 by Southern Illinois. Notable players on the team include Wayne Tyrone and Jim Tyrone, with the latter hitting .349 in 52 games with 37 RBIs. Ogletree was named College Coach of the Year by both The Sporting News and the South Plains Professional Scouts Association. The appearance in the College World Series remains the only appearance for the team. The Broncs made the Tournament consecutively for the next five seasons from 1972 to 1976, with the 1975 team winning 63 games, although they were beaten by Texas in the South Central Regional Finals 9–2, with two losses in the Finals in other years also caused by Texas.\nTragedy struck the team on February 24, 1973, when Jody Ramsey was killed in an electrical accident while working on construction of the new baseball stadium being built for the team. The previous season, Ramsey (in his only season with the Broncs) had hit for .346 in 56 games, with 47 runs, 64 hits and 17 stolen bases while leading the team in numerous categories. Petitions from students to the Board of Regents led to the park being named after Ramsey, with 1974 being the first season that the Broncs began play in Jody Ramsey Memorial Stadium. His jersey number of 6 was taken out of circulation by Ogletree for the rest of his tenure as manager. The Broncs would play in the stadium from 1974 to 2000, with it being dismantled three years later to make way for an educational building.\nAfter a lull in 1977, they were invited back to the Tournament in 1978, coming back two more times, although they failed to reach the Finals. The Broncs returned to the Tournament in 1983 after going 64–19–1, a program record for wins. In the Central Regional, they lost to Texas in the Semifinals, who went on to win the College World Series that year. Olgetree led them back to the Tournament in 1986 with a 42–19 record. In the Central Regional, they were beaten by Pepperdine 11–0, which sent them to the Loser's Bracket. They beat San Diego State 10–6 to survive a bit longer, but a loss to Texas 9–5 eliminated them from the Regional. As of 2018, this remains their final appearances in the NCAA tournament. In 1988, the Broncs joined the American South Conference, where they played for four seasons. Olgetree led the team to a 126–99 record over those years, but they went 24–28 in conference play. The Broncs joined the Sun Belt Conference in 1992. Ogletree coached the team for six more seasons, having low moments such as an 11–39 record in 1994 and 17–37 in 1995 along with going 48–95 in Sun Belt play over six years along with going 135–184, but he managed to lead them to a 30–22 record in 1997, a winning season for the first time since 1992 along with a 14–12 conference record, their first winning season in conference play. Ogletree retired after the season, having won over 1,000 games for the team. In his first twenty seasons (1969 to 1989), he led them to a season of .500 or better in each of those seasons, with only five losing seasons in 29 seasons of coaching.\nReggie Tredaway era (1998–2002).\nReggie Tredaway, former third baseman for the Broncs and assistant coach for the team, was hired to coach the team in 1998. In his first season, he led them to an 18–32 record, the fifth losing season in nine seasons. This was their last season in the Sun Belt. Tredaway led the Broncs to improvement in his next two seasons, going 30–23 and 31–19–1, but neither season resulted in postseason play. The team faltered in his next two years, going 12–40 and 15–38. He announced his retirement after the 2002 season.\nWillie Gawlik era (2003–2008).\nIn 2003, Willie Gawlik was hired as head coach. Gawlik, a former Bronc player from the 1971 CWS team, had served as coach at Texas Wesleyan (1996–2001) and Central Arkansas (2002) prior to the hiring. In six seasons at the helm with the Broncs, he never led them to a winning season, reaching a high of 24 wins (with 29 losses) in 2006 while having two seasons of under 20 wins, with a 40–138 record in road games. After a 21–35 season and amidst complaints from players over his coaching along with conflicts between coaches and players, the university decided to not renew his contract, while firing two assistant coaches. Gawlik has the third lowest winning percentage as coach of the program and the lowest for any coach that had coached more than one season.\nManny Mantrana era (2009–2017).\nIn 2009, Manny Mantrana was hired as head coach. He had formerly served as head coach of St. Thomas University, coaching them from 1997 to 2008. In his first season, the Broncs went 14–41. Texas–Pan American moved to the Great West Conference after the season. The Broncs improved the following year, going 22–33 with a 9–18 conference record while finishing 6th in the eight team conference. In the 2010 Great West Conference baseball tournament, the Broncs lost to Northern Colorado 10–0 while beating their other two opponents (NYIT and NJIT), but the loss served as the tiebreaker, eliminating them from a bid in the Finals, which were held in the home stadium of the Broncs. The 2011 team faltered to a 21–32 record, the 11th straight losing season for the program.\nThe 2012 season proved to be a step up for the team, as they finished 30–22 with a 16–12 conference record, finishing 2nd in the conference behind Utah Valley (who won all 28 conference games). In the 2012 Great West Conference baseball tournament, they beat Chicago State 10–4 to get to the Second Round, but they were beaten by North Dakota 18–7 to fall to the Loser Bracket. A subsequent loss to Northern Colorado 14–13 eliminated the Broncs. They went 28–30 in the following year while going 17–10 in Great West play to finish 3rd. In the 2013 Great West Conference baseball tournament, they beat NYIT 7–6, but they lost 3–1 to Houston Baptist (the eventual champion), with a subsequent loss in the Loser Bracket to Chicago State knocking them out of the tournament. The conference soon dissolved, and the Broncs moved to the Western Athletic Conference for the 2014 season. Mantrana led them to a 27–30 record and a 17–10 conference record for a third-place finish. In the 2014 Western Athletic Conference baseball tournament, the Broncs lost 9–2 in the Second Round to Utah Valley, with a 7–4 loss in the Loser Bracket to New Mexico State knocking them out of the tournament. The team tumbled in 2015, going 21–30–1 and 6–20–1 in WAC play to finish 10th. The Broncs became the Vaqueros after the season ended. He led the team to a 21–28 record in 2016 and 26–28 in 2017, finishing 8th each time in the WAC. On May 24, 2017, Mantrana stepped down as coach, while staying at UTRGV to serve as the Special Assistant to the athletic director.\nDerek Matlock era (2018-present).\nIn June 2017, UTRGV announced the hiring of Derek Matlock as the new head coach of the team. Matlock had previously served as recruiting coordinator and pitching coach for West Virginia for the previous five seasons, along with serving at the same position for Texas State from 2007 to 2012. On May 18, 2019, the Vaqueros clinched a share of the WAC regular season title, finishing 1st along with California Baptist and New Mexico State. UTRGV finished the regular season 34–19 with a 18–9 conference record. It is the first conference title of any sort since 1955, with the wins being the most in one season since winning 37 in 1991.\nAll-time season results.\nResults accurate as of the beginning of the 2023 season.\nMajor League Baseball.\nUTPA had 35 Major League Baseball Draft selections from the start of the draft in 1965 until the 2015 merger that created UTRGV.\nJose Garcia became the first player who played under the UTRGV name to be drafted. He was taken by the White Sox in 2017.\nCoaches.\nUTRGV has had twelve head coaches in its tenure.\nPostseason.\nThe Vaqueros (then known as the Pan American Broncs) have made the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship thirteen times, with one appearance in the College World Series. They have a combined record of 15–26, with a 2–2 record in the College World Series as of .\nNAIA.\nDuring their time in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the Vaqueros appeared in the NAIA Tournament twice. They went a combined record of 6–6.\nRetired numbers.\nUTRGV has retired two jersey numbers, with the latter being retired across all sports."

        "text": "Tennis is not a very popular sport and Pakistanis compete in very few international events. The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) organises the game in the country.\nHistory.\nAhmad Hasan Khokhar was the first Pakistani to represent his country in a Grand Slam tournament, playing at Wimbledon in 1948. Haroon Rahim was a very successful player. Belonging to a family of prominent tennis players, he was the youngest ever singles national champion as well as the youngest to play for Pakistan in Davis Cup competition at 15 years of age. He has not only been the highest ranked singles player in Pakistan's tennis history (34th in October 1977) but was also the winner of a number of ATP Singles and Doubles titles. Lately, Aisam ul Haq Qureshi created history in Pakistani tennis, as he reached the finals of 2010 US Open – Men's Doubles and 2010 US Open – Mixed Doubles.\nThe Pakistan Davis Cup team have previously reached the world group play-offs. Tennis events are very rare in Pakistan and there is hardly an international tennis event, apart from ATP tournaments.\nDavis Cup.\nPakistan Played its first Davis Cup Europe Zone Match against Switzerland at Montreux in 1948. Its first Davis Cup tie of Eastern Zone win was against Sri Lanka, with a score of 4-0, played by Munir Pirzada, Qutubudin Ahmed, Iftikhar Ahmed and Zulfiqar Rahim. Pakistan qualified for the Final of the Eastern Zone in 1984 by beating some of the strongest teams of the Asian Group: Malaysia in January 1984, Indonesia in March 1984 and Thailand in May 1984. Pakistan lost the final against Japan.\nDue to the change in format of the Davis Cup Eastern Zone to Asia Oceania, Pakistan secured a place in Group-II in 1988. Pakistan again reached the Final but lost to Hong Kong.\nThe Pakistan Team distinguished themselves in international tennis competitions when they beat strong teams such as New Zealand in 2018 and Thailand in 2019 and qualified for the World Group Playoff for the first time in the history of Pakistani Tennis.\nIt was also one step away from qualifying for the World Group when losing the 1984 Eastern Zone Final against Japan.\nList of successful tennis players.\nPakistan has produced many successful tennis players, particularly in the Davis Cup (Asia region). They include:\nThree Pakistani players have enjoyed notable success: Haroon Rahim who played Davis Cup at the age of 15 years, second Hamid-ul-haq who played Davis Cup till the age of 35 years and third Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi who is notable for playing longest Rubber for 5 hrs 20 minutes against Mark Nielson from New Zealand in September 2004 at Islamabad and longest tie also against New Zealand which lasted 16 hrs 20 minutes. Gibran Khan played for the Pakistan Davis Cup Team and won the Pakistani Junior National Open as a teenager"

        "text": "Ryan Allen (born February 28, 1990) is an American former football punter who played in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Oregon State Beavers and the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. Allen won twice the Ray Guy Award in 2011 and 2012, and also was a unanimous All-American in 2012. He was signed by the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent after the 2013 NFL draft.\nHigh school career.\nAllen attended West Salem High School in Salem, Oregon, where he played on the football team for two years as a punter/kicker. In 2007, he was named to the all-state first team.\nCollege career.\nIn 2008, Allen walked on at Oregon State along with fellow punter Johnny Hekker. As a freshman, he was redshirted. He did not play in 2009 as he remained behind Hekker on the team's depth chart. He then went to Louisiana Tech, and in 2010, he played in 12 games, averaging 40.8 yards on 60 punts. He had 21 punts go inside the 20-yard line. Four of his punts went over 50 yards, including a season-long punt of 66 yards.\nIn 2011, Allen punted 83 times and set a school record with a 46.3 yard average per punt. He ranked first in the nation with 39 punts inside the 20 yard line, and he had a season-long punt of 72 yards against Mississippi State. In the Poinsettia Bowl, he averaged 43.2 yards on five punts. Allen was named to the All-WAC first team and won the Ray Guy Award as the best college football punter.\nAllen averaged 48.0 yards on 45 punts as a senior in 2012. He had 21 punts that were longer than 50 yards and 20 punts that were downed inside the 20 yard line. Allen had a career-long 85-yard punt against New Mexico State. He led the NCAA in punting yards per punt, was a unanimous All-American, and won the Ray Guy Award for the second time, the first punter to ever win back-to-back Ray Guy Awards.\nProfessional career.\nNew England Patriots.\nTwo punters—Jeff Locke and Sam Martin—were selected in the 2013 NFL Draft; Allen was not. He signed a standard three-year contract as an undrafted free agent with the New England Patriots on April 27, 2013. During training camp, Allen beat out veteran Zoltán Meskó, who was released at the final roster cutdown.\nAllen was named the Week 14 AFC Special Teams Player of the Week for his contributions to the Patriots win over San Diego Chargers. In Super Bowl XLIX, he punted four times for 196 yards and set a then Super Bowl record with a 64-yard punt, helping the Patriots to a 28–24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. On July 25, 2015, the Patriots signed Allen to a three-year contract extension; the NFL's Collective Bargaining Agreement allows undrafted rookies to sign extensions after two seasons. The new deal, which ran through the 2018 season, had $6.1 million in new money, including a $2 million signing bonus and $1 million in guaranteed salary in 2016.\nIn 2016, Allen was praised for his performance in the Patriots' Week 3 win, 27–0, over the Houston Texans. He punted seven times, averaging over 49 yards per punt; none of his punts were returned, and all of them left the Texans starting at or behind their own 20-yard line. His performance earned him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. On February 5, 2017, Allen was part of the Patriots team that won Super Bowl LI. In the game, Allen punted four times for 166 yards as the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons by a score of 34–28 in overtime. Allen made his third Super Bowl appearance the next season for the Patriots in Super Bowl LII; however, the Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 41–33, and Allen never punted during the game. The next year, his former college teammate Johnny Hekker broke his Super Bowl record for the Los Angeles Rams, though the Patriots would win that game and give Allen his third Super Bowl championship.\nOn March 22, 2019, Allen re-signed with the Patriots on a one-year deal. However, on August 19, 2019, he was released in favor of rookie Jake Bailey who was drafted by the Patriots in the fifth round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nOn November 4, 2019, Allen signed with the Atlanta Falcons, making him the team's fifth Punter of the season. He was released on November 29, 2019, when Matt Bosher was activated off injured reserve. He was re-signed again on December 7, 2019, following an injury to Bosher. Despite playing only half a season in 2019, and having a career low in yards per punt, Allen had arguably his most accurate season in the NFL, pinning exactly half of his punts (14 out of 28) inside the 20.\nOn February 18, 2020, Allen signed a one-year contract extension with the Falcons. On August 2, 2020, Allen was released by the Falcons.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn November 7, 2020, Allen was signed by the Tennessee Titans. He was waived on November 17, and signed to the team's practice squad two days later. He was released from the practice squad on November 24, 2020.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn December 3, 2020, Allen signed with the practice squad of the Indianapolis Colts. He was elevated to the active roster on December 5 and 12 for the team's weeks 13 and 14 games against the Houston Texans and Las Vegas Raiders, and reverted to the practice squad after each game. He was released on December 21.\nPersonal life.\nAllen was born in Salem, Oregon, on February 28, 1990. His parents are Mike and Sherry Allen, and he has one sister, Jessica. He was a business major at Louisiana Tech."

        "title": "1953 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1953 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the eleventh season of the circuit. The teams Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kalamazoo Lassies, Muskegon Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 110-game schedule, while the Shaugnessy playoffs featured the top four teams. This time, the postseason was reduced to a best-of-three series for both rounds.\nThe AAGPBL had six teams in 1953, the only change in its lineup being that the Battle Creek Belles had transferred and become the Muskegon Belles. The league was still using a 10 inches ball, but some changes were made to the game to make it more competitive and exciting. The base paths were lengthened from 72 feet to 75 feet and another foot was added to pitching distance, making it 56 feet. Nevertheless, the new changes had little impact on the game, as the high batting averages and low ERA's remained almost intact compared to the previous year. Joanne Weaver of Fort Wayne won her second batting title in a row with a .346 average, while Jean Faut of South Bend topped the pitching list with a 1.51 ERA. No pitcher won 20 games for the first time in league history. Faut and Grand Rapids' Eleanor Moore tied for first with 17 wins, while Fort Wayne's Betty Foss amassed 144 hits, that would eventually become a single-season record. Faut, who also led the league in strikeouts (143) and hurled her second career perfect game, was honored with the Player of the Year Award, her second in three years.\nIn the first round of the postseason, first place Fort Wayne faced third place Kalamazoo and second place Grand Rapids drew fourth place Rockford. After a 12-inning, 3–1 victory of Fort Wayne in the series opener, Kalamazoo pitchers Dorothy Naum and Kay Blumetta silenced the powerful Daisies batters in the next two games by scores of 2–1 and 5–3, respectively. In Game 2, Naum helped herself by batting a home run and Jean Lovell singled in the winning run in the top of the 10th inning. Lovell also drove in two runs in Game 3 to help the Lassies advance to the final round.\nIn the other series, Rockford connected 14 hits in Game 1 and pounded the Chicks, 9–2, while Rose Gacioch scattered eight hits and struck out four batters in a complete game victory. But Earlene Risinger pitched a six-hit, 2–0 shutout in the next game to tie the series. In Game 3, Dorothy Mueller held Rockford to eight hits in a 4–3 win to send Grand Rapids into the finals.\nThe Chicks swept the Lassies in the final series. In Game 1, Mary Lou Studnicka gave up seven hits and fanned seven in an eight-inning win, 5–2, while Eleanor Moore was credited with the save. Joyce Ricketts led the attack with two runs batted in. Risinger continued her winning ways in Game 2, giving up three runs on seven hits while striking out nine en route to a 4–3 victory. Once again, Ricketts drove in two runs and Risinger even contributed to her own cause with two RBI, to whip Kalamazoo for the championship in a cold-weather, shortened seven-inning game."

Tofino, British Columbia is the unofficial surf capital of Canada. Canada's west coast has surfable waves year-round, and Tofino was listed in the world's Top 50 surf destinations by CNN and Outdoor Magazine named Tofino the 'best surf town' in North America in 2010. In Tofino, ocean water temperatures are consistent year-round, averaging 8-12 degrees (C), and advancements in wetsuit technologies are attributed with making year-round surfing comfortable and safe. Bordered by an old growth rainforest, Tofino also has the most temperate climate in Canada. The Atlantic Ocean on Canada's east coast also has a growing surfing scene. Tofino has remained relatively undeveloped due to its proximity to Clayoquot Sound, a UNESCO-protected biosphere reserve.\nRiver surfing.\nOn 24 July 2013, the North American record for surfing a single river wave was set on the Petitcodiac River's tidal bore, in New Brunswick.\nThe Lachine Rapids in St. Lawrence River in Montreal is home to the Habitat 67 standing wave. The Ottawa River in Ottawa also has an active river surfing community. There are also growing river surfing scenes in traditionally inland prairie areas like Alberta, and Manitoba.\nLake surfing.\nThe Great Lakes in Ontario have an active surf scene. There are surf communities on Lake Huron, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and Lake Superior. The Wyldewood Surf Club, dedicated to lake surfing, was established in Port Colborne in 1965.\nCompetitions.\nCanada will try to participate in the 2020 Olympics surfing events, and the country's representatives were decided in May 2019, in Tofino, right after the Rip Curl Nationals."

        "text": "The 2012 Rafael Nadal tennis season officially began on 2 January with the start of the 2012 ATP World Tour.\nYear summary.\nAsian/Pacific hard court season and Australian Open.\nNadal began his World Tour season at the Qatar Open. He beat Philipp Kohlschreiber and qualifier Denis Gremelmayr in rounds one and two and then won against seventh-seeded Mikhail Youzhny. In the semifinal he played poorly and lost to Gaël Monfils in two routine sets.\nAustralian Open.\nIn the Australian Open Nadal began the tournament by breezing past qualifier Alex Kuznetsov of United States. The second round against Tommy Haas, who has never won a set against Rafael, was a little tighter but Nadal again advanced in three straight sets. He outwitted compatriot Feliciano López in fourth round and won in the quarterfinals in an epic four-set match against Tomáš Berdych, who was playing at a high-level. He then beat Roger Federer, who was riding a 24-match win streak heading into the match, in a four-set match in the semifinals. With his win, he reached the finals of all four Grand Slams consecutively. In the final, on 29 January, he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in five sets, the match being the longest ever match for a Grand Slam title. The epic final lasted 5 hours and 53 minutes. They set a new world record, breaking the latest longest major singles final between Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl, which lasted 4 hours and 54 minutes, at the US Open in 1988.\nUS hard court season.\nAt Indian Wells, Nadal made it to the semifinals, where he was beaten by Roger Federer, who went on to win the tournament. However, he won the Doubles event of the tournament for the second time in succession after beating John Isner and Sam Querrey in the final.\nHe also made the semifinals in Miami, but withdrew because of problems with his knee, the hard-court season taking its toll on his weak spot once again.\nEuropean clay court season and the French Open.\nAs the clay court season started, Nadal was seeded 2nd at the 2012 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters in April. He was troubled in his opening round by seed number 47, Nieminen of Finland, but prevailed in two sets. He then went on to clinch his 8th Monte Carlo trophy in 9 tries by beating Qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin, easing through Stanislas Wawrinka, and defeating Gilles Simon in the Semifinal, before topping World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final. This ended a streak of 7 straight final losses to Djokovic, which began at the 2011 Indian Wells Masters Final. Novak admitted that Nadal was just a better player, when asked whether the death of his grandfather early at the beginning of the tournament was affecting his whole play.\nA day after the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters Final, Nadal traveled to Barcelona where he received a 'bye' in the first round. His tremendous record on clay continued as he beat compatriot David Ferrer to clinch his seventh title in eight years at the Barcelona Open.\nThe Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open did not go very well for Nadal since he lost early in the 3R to Fernando Verdasco. Nadal stated that he was very unhappy with the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed. Several other players such as Novak Djokovic agreed with Nadal in his criticism.\nIn the last tournament before the French Open Nadal went to Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. He won every single match in two sets finishing with his second victory over Novak Djokovic and his third title in 2012.\nFrench Open.\nAt the French Open, Nadal managed to win all six matches before facing Novak Djokovic in the Final, in which Nadal won in four sets. During the entire tournament, Nadal only lost a single set (against Djokovic in the final). With his seventh championship victory at Roland Garros, Nadal became the most successful tennis player at the French Open.\nThroughout the entire Clay court season, Nadal did not drop a single set on the red clay across 3 tournaments and 23 matches, which started in Monte Carlo, Barcelona, BNL d'Italia and was ended by Novak Djokovic in the Final of the French Open. He collected 5 bagels along the way (a bagel is a score of 6–0 in a set of a tennis match).\nEuropean grass court season, Wimbledon Championships and the Summer Olympics.\nFor the first time since his debut in 2005, Nadal revisited the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany. There he enrolled in both the Doubles and Singles events. He partnered up with Marcel Granollers as his Doubles teammate as well as \"hitting company.\" After disappointing Quarter Finals losses at both the Singles and Doubles events of the Gerry Weber, Rafael Nadal took a week off from the tour and took a visit to his hometown, Manacor.\nWimbledon Championships.\nWimbledon Championships did not go well for Nadal and was a disaster for him. He lost early in the second round to Lukáš Rosol in 5 sets in one of the greatest shocks in Grand Slam history. Rosol then succumbed to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the following round. After his loss, Nadal was off into yet another rest, this time in Sardinia.\nLondon Olympics.\nNadal's second appearance at the Summer Olympics, saw him chosen by the Spanish Sports Federation as the flag-bearer of Spain. He gained automatic entry to the Men's Singles Event, was the defending champion, and was the pre-tournament favourite to retain the Gold Medal, despite his early exit from Wimbledon in June.\nBut on 19 July, Nadal stated that he will be withdrawing from the Olympics citing a knee injury as his issue.\nSummer US hard court season.\nAfter he withdrew from the London Olympics due to knee tendinitis, Nadal missed the rest of the US Open Series, leading up to the US Open, stating that he will not return to court before the recovery.\nU.S. Open.\nOn 15 August, Nadal announced via Twitter that he was withdrawing from the 2012 US Open (tennis). He had already withdrawn from the 2012 Rogers Cup and the 2012 Western &amp; Southern Open.\nAutumn season.\nOn 3 September, Nadal announced on his homepage that he would not play for the next two months in order to rest and allow his knee to recover. He ultimately missed the remainder of the 2012 season, having received qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals in London after his second round exit from Wimbledon, before pulling out due to injury. Despite missing the final four months of the season, Nadal managed to finish ranked No. 4 in the world, his lowest year-end ranking in eight years.\nNadal stated in his announcement: \"I have missed the Olympics and the US Open in the last few weeks, two of the most important tournaments of the year and that I really wanted to play. I really want to be back competing and enjoying the tennis tour, but I have many years in front of me and my knee needs some rest. I will be back when I have no pain and able to compete with guarantee[...].\"\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nNadal's 2012 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\n1 The symbol (i) = \"indoors\" means that the respective tournament will be held indoors. \n2 Difference between new points and previous points.

        "title": "Stockport Lacrosse Club",
        "text": "Stockport Lacrosse Club is a lacrosse club based in Davenport, Greater Manchester, a suburb of Stockport. The club was established in 1876 and is the oldest lacrosse club in England. Stockport currently field both men's and women's lacrosse teams as well as running respective junior programmes. The club have been based at Cale Green Pavilion in Davenport since 1883.\nHistory.\nThe Beginning.\nStockport Lacrosse Club was founded in 1876 as a result of an exhibition tour organised by the \"founding father of the modern game', William George Beers. Stockport Lacrosse Club is widely regarded as one of (if not the) oldest existing lacrosse club in the world. Montreal Lacrosse Club and Mohawk Lacrosse Club were founded earlier but have folded and re-formed in that period.\nThe Great years.\nThe Senior Flags victory of 1896 was the start of the first of two conquering periods. For eight consecutive seasons from 1896 to 1903, Stockport swept aside all opposition to win the Flags, a record that has not been equalled since. In the same period the Iroquois Cup and First division Championship were both won six times. The club has to thank in particular two families, the Masons and Johnsons whose family members made up between them nine out of the total of twenty who played on the team during that period. The Mason family alone accounting for six of the players. A major trophy of the period remains in the possession of the club. This is the Flags Final Challenge Flag, which was won outright in 1898. The flag is a large, finely detailed embroidered Trophy depicting two lacrosse players dressed in the kit of the period stood on each side of a shield, with the winning clubs of the previous seasons scrolled on each side. The Challenge Flag is permanently on display at the club's Headquarters.\nCale Green Pavilion.\nIn 1883, the Mayor of Stockport, Henry Bell JP, donated the Cale Green ground to the town with financial support from the club. This ground was the home to Stockport Lacrosse Club but also to Stockport Cricket Club and Cheshire County Cricket Club. The layout of the ground has changed very little over the years, with the cricket pitch in front of the pavilion, two bowling greens and a separate pitch on a lower level which is the club's main pitch. The original pavilion is shown on the right, shows the original entrance in the middle at the front, and two windows above the door. The enclosure in front of the pavilion was for club members only, and a tiered grass banking led down to the pitch.\nIt was some fifty years before the next major change, which saw an extension being added to the western end of the building which in due course became the function room. There is a clear line along the roof tiles which shows the size of the extension. The extension also added a new area below ground and the changing rooms were moved below ground with the exit being next to the front door. The picture to the right shows the extension, and also the effects of some maintenance which has led to the removal of the two windows above the door and the central chimney from the roof.\nL. R. Grainger.\nThroughout the decades, in particular since 1945 there has been a number of stalwarts of Junior Schemes who gave themselves the task of developing their own particular club's juniors and given the natural ageing process, the senior strength also.\nWithout the existence of this dedicated care during the 1950s and 60s many of the clubs which were able to continue after the War years could have faded through the lack of new players.\nOne such stalwart for the Stockport Club in 1950 was Les Grainger. Another such enthusiasts of that period was Ted Donnet for South Manchester and Wythenshawe. Les took on Stockport's juniors at the Annual General Meeting on Monday 12 September 1949 when he was appointed unanimously as Honorary Junior Secretary for the then forthcoming season 1949/50. The first junior games arranged by Les in his new role as Junior Secretary were... \n22 October, Manchester Grammar School, \n24 November, Ashton, \n7 January, Cheadle.\nThere is no record of the results entered into the minute's books, however Leslie's memory provides a favourable record if not an actual result.\nThe position of Junior Scheme Secretary was retained by Les without a break through the '50s, '60s '70s and '80s until 1989, a total of forty continuous years. A remarkable record of achievement. Retirement was not on the agenda however, the all-encompassing position of recruitment, beginners and U12s team manager was undertaken until the early 2000s when he retired due to health reasons.\nA quite remarkable fact is that virtually all the current Stockport players from the juniors upwards, through all the senior teams, including the veterans, have been trained within the L.R.G. Junior training scheme and bear all the skills and loyalty alike.\nAnother major achievement by Leslie was the creation of the Stockport Metros, an umbrella organisation for combinations of Clubs to be able take juniors on tours with specifically the US in mind, and has succeeded in doing so on 13 occasions since 1976, the last twelve of these being part of an annual exchange with Anne Arundel County Youth Lacrosse, Maryland, USA, which still continues.\nMr. Grainger died in 2011.\nSenior Lacrosse.\nMen's Lacrosse.\nStockport currently field three senior men's teams. Stockport's first team are one of the most successful and decorated lacrosse teams in the country.\nIn the 2009/10 season they went undefeated and won a total of eight trophies including: \nStockport has produced a great number of England internationals who have represented their nation in both World &amp; European Championships and even in the Olympics, when Lacrosse was an exhibition sport at the 1908, 1928 and 1948. Stockport have won the North of England Men's Lacrosse Association Senior Flags 25 times.\nWomen's Lacrosse.\nStockport currently field a single senior women's team. The women's section was established in the early '90s and has grown into one of the biggest women's clubs in the north. They have players with junior and senior international honours for Wales, Scotland and England.\nJunior Lacrosse.\nThe boys junior section currently run teams at U12's, U14's, U16's and U19's level. The girls junior section currently run teams at U11's, U13's, U15's, U18's level.\nInternational honours.\nThe following Stockport players have senior representational honours in the following championships. * = Were not yet members of Stockport Lacrosse Club"

In his first two seasons with the club he alternated between starting at five eighth and coming from the bench, he first played at centre in 1993.

He started at wing, centre, five eighth and halfback during the year, playing in nineteen of the club's matches.

        "title": "1954 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1954 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the twelfth and last season of the circuit. The AAGPBL was left with five teams after the Muskegon Belles franchise folded at the end of the past season. As a result, it was the lowest number of teams since its opening season in 1943. The Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kalamazoo Lassies, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 96-game schedule, while the Shaugnessy playoffs featured the top four teams in a best-of-three first round series, with the two winning teams facing in a best-of-five series to decide the championship.\nRegular season.\nSeveral changes were made to the rules for this season, making the game much like Major League Baseball. The ball size was reduced from 10 inches to 9 inches, while the pitching distance increased from 56 to 60 feet. In addition, the base paths were lengthened from 75 to 85 feet, five feet short of the major leagues. But the most significant change was the shortening of the outfield fences, which dramatically increased the number of home runs hit in the past. The five teams combined to hit 408 home runs, which tripled the number of homers hit during a regular season.\nJoanne Weaver of Fort Wayne won her third consecutive batting title in a row, this time clearing the .400 batting average barrier with a .429 mark. Not since Ted Williams in the majors in 1941 (.406) and minor leaguer Artie Wilson in 1948 (.402) had someone broken the .400 barrier, and nobody has done it since. Weaver also set single season records for the most home runs (29), total bases (254), on-base percentage (.479) and slugging average (.763). No pitcher won 20 games for the second year in a row, while South Bend's Janet Rumsey topped the league in earned run average (2.18) and complete games (21), ending second in wins (15), shutouts (5) and innings pitched (169). Gloria Cordes of Kalamazoo turned the best pitching performance of the year, when she hurled three consecutive shutouts in 34 scoreless innings of work. Weaver was honored with the Player of the Year Award at the end of the season.\nThe only team not to make it to the postseason was last-place Rockford Peaches, the most successful squad in league history after winning four titles in the previous 12 seasons, including three in a row at one point.\nPostseason.\nFirst round.\nIn the first round of the postseason, first place Fort Wayne faced third place Grand Rapids and second place South Bend played fourth place Kalamazoo. Fort Wayne defeated Grand Rapids, 8–7, in Game 1. After that, Grand Rapids team members voted not to play against Fort Wayne the next two contests, because the league had allowed Rockford catcher Ruth Richard to play on the Fort Wayne team as a last-minute replacement for Rita Briggs, who was sidelined with a broken wrist. During a debate over the eligibility of Richard, Fort Wayne manager Bill Allington and Grand Rapids manager Woody English came into a fistfight at home plate before Game 2. Grand Rapids forfeited both games to give the Daisies the first round. In the other series, Kalamazoo lost the first game to South Bend, 6–3, but pitchers Nancy Warren and Elaine Roth held the Blue Sox in the next two games by scores of 6–3 and 10–7, respectively.\nChampionship series.\nIn Game 1 of the final series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17–9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitting 2-for-4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben, Fern Shollenberger and Chris Ballingall, who hit a grand slam, also slugged one each. Katherine Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, and her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one. Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18–7 record with 3.23 earned run average during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss.\nFort Wayne evened the series against Kalamazoo winning Game 2, 11–4, after hitting a series-record five home runs off two pitchers. Horstman started the feat with a two-run home run to open the score in the first inning. In the rest of the game, Betty Foss added two homers with five runs batted in, while Joanne Weaver and Jean Geissinger added solo shots. Nancy Mudge and Dorothy Schroeder homered for Kalamazoo, and Peppas, who played at first base, hit a solo homer in three at-bats. Marilyn Jones limited the Lassies to four runs on nine hits. Phyllis Baker was the winning pitcher and Gloria Cordes was the loser.\nIn Game 3, the Daisies beat the Lassies, 8–7, fueled again by a heavy hitting from Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs. Peppas went 1-for-4 to spark a seventh-inning three-run rally, but Fort Wayne came back in the bottom of the inning with two runs that marked the difference. Phyllis Baker won the game and Nancy Warren was the losing pitcher.\nIn other close score, Kalamazoo evened the series in Game 4 with a 6–5 victory against Fort Wayne, behind a strong pitching effort by Cordes, who hurled a complete game. Ballingall led the offensive with three hits, one run and one RBI before being ejected in the 9th inning. Peppas also contributed with a single, a double and one RBI in four at-bats. Kline lost her second decision in the series.\nIn decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3-for-5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8–5 margin to give the Lassies the championship title. She received support from Mary Taylor (5-for-5), Balingall (3-for-4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run off pitcher Jones in the bottom of the eight. Peppas finished with an average of .400 (6-for-15) and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in league history."

Founded in 1927, it is one of the oldest and most prestigious cricket clubs in Kenya. It takes part in the Nairobi-based NPCA (Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association) Leagues and in the national cricket tournaments such as the East African tournaments, run by Cricket Kenya.\nKongonis is T20 franchise cricket team in the East Africa Premier League and East Africa Cup, tournaments started by Cricket Kenya. The team is based in Nairobi, Kenya and is operated by the Kenya Kongonis Cricket Club which is a member of the Nairobi Province Cricket Association.\nEast African Tournaments Record.\nThe Twenty20 competition of East Africa Premier League and the 50-over competition of the East Africa Cup was initiated by Cricket Kenya to raise the profile of the game and develop a grassroots structure that would consistently provide young talent to perform for the national team in international events. In the inaugural tournament, the 20-over competition were mostly dominated by the Ugandan teams invited to compete in the tournaments, but they dominated the 50-over competition, finishing top of the table, winning 6 games out of 10 matches, and is due to play the final against the against Nile Knights, one of two Ugandan teams along with Rwenzori Warriors to compete in the tournaments.\nHistory.\nThe franchise was first formed when the East African competitions were formed in the wake of the 2011 World Cup disaster. Kongonis were one among the four Kenyan teams among those tournaments.\nAlthough they did not make much of an impression in the inaugural East African Premier League, dominated by the two Ugandan sides, they did dominate in the opening rounds. It was a different story in the 50-over counterpart, the East African Cup, though. They totally dominated the tournament, and except the occasional Ugandan good performance, nearly every franchise appeared minnows in front of them. They topped the group with 28 points from 10 games (6 wins and only two losses), and then won comprehensively in the twice-postponed final against Ugandan side Nile Knights (the other being Rwenzori Warriors) by 84 runs. After they posted a massive 280/5 (Rakep Patel 92, Duncan Allan 65), Pakistani-born Kenyan cricketer Abdul Rehman took 4-32 as their opponents could only manage 196/9.\n2012 EAPL Squad.\nThe squad list is updated as of the 2012-13 East African Premier League.\nNotable players.\nHere is a list of Kongonis cricketers who have gone on to achieve something extraordinary or some other famous achievement.\nStatistics.\nUK Averages.\nThe Kongonis Cricket Club has toured the UK for many years.

        "title": "List of UEFA European Championship finals",
        "text": "The UEFA European Championship is an association football competition established in 1960. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), the sport's European governing body, and takes place every four years.\nThe European Championship final is the last match of the competition, and the result determines which country's team is declared European champion. It is a one-off match decided in regulation time. In the event of a draw, extra time is played. If scores are then still level, a penalty shoot-out determines the winner, as per the rules since 1976; prior to that, finals still tied after extra time would be replayed, as was the case with the 1968 final. During extra time, the golden goal rule (by which the first team to score won the match) applied in 1996 and 2000, and the silver goal rule (by which a team could win the match by winning the first half of extra time) would have applied in 2004 but was not put in practice. The winners are awarded a replica of the trophy (the original remains with UEFA), while the losing finalists (and semi-finalists) are presented with a plaque. Gold and silver medals are awarded to the players of the winning and losing finalists respectively.\nGermany and Spain are the most successful teams in the history of the tournament, winning three times each. France and Italy have each won the competition twice, while six other teams, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, and Portugal, have triumphed once. Yugoslavia, Belgium and England have qualified for the final without success.\nThe winners of the first ever final, held in Paris in 1960, were the Soviet Union, who defeated Yugoslavia 2–1 after extra time, while in the latest one, hosted in London in 2021, Italy won over England on penalties following a 1–1 draw after extra time.\nHistory.\nThe first final of the UEFA European Football Championship (then referred to as the European Nations' Cup Final) was contested in July 1960 in Paris between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Milan Galić scored for Yugoslavia just before half-time but Slava Metreveli equalised soon after the break, and the scores remained level, sending the game into extra time. With seven minutes left, Viktor Ponedelnik won the match for the Soviet Union, scoring the winner with a header. The 1960 champions qualified for the final of the 1964 tournament, where they faced hosts Spain. Chus Pereda scored early for the home side, but the match was levelled two minutes later when Galimzyan Khusainov equalised. Nearly 80,000 spectators at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid had to wait for the winner which came six minutes from time, courtesy of a header from Spaniard Marcelino.\nThe hosts, Italy, faced Yugoslavia in the final of the 1968 tournament, now rebranded as the European Football Championship. Italy had qualified for the final by virtue of winning a coin toss following their goalless semi-final against the Soviet Union. The final ended 1–1, forcing a replay to be conducted two days later. This time Italy triumphed, winning 2–0 with first-half goals from Gigi Riva and Pietro Anastasi. Four years later, the final, held in Brussels, produced a record winning margin that would last for 44 years. The Soviet Union, finalists for the third time in four tournaments, were defeated 3–0 by West Germany with Gerd Müller and Herbert Wimmer scoring the winning goals. The incumbent champions qualified for the final of the 1976 tournament, where they faced Czechoslovakia. A late equaliser from German Bernd Hölzenbein to make it 2–2 saw the game go into extra time and eventually to a penalty shoot-out. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot, described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.\nFour years later, the final returned to the Stadio Olimpico where West Germany, in their third consecutive final, faced Belgium. Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed West Germany into the lead from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner, securing his country's second victory in the championship. The 1984 final, in Paris, featured hosts France against 1964 champions Spain. Two second-half goals, one each from Michel Platini and Bruno Bellone, secured a home victory; Platini ended the tournament with nine goals, the most scored in the championship finals by any player to date. The Netherlands qualified for their first final in the 1988 tournament in West Germany, where they faced the Soviet Union who were playing in their fourth final. Ruud Gullit scored in the first half and Marco van Basten doubled the lead in the second for the Netherlands with a volley which has since been described variously as \"stunning\", \"spectacular\", and the \"best goal scored in the competition's history\". With a 2–0 victory, the Netherlands secured their first \"major\" title.\nFollowing Yugoslavia's expulsion from the competition in 1992, Denmark were invited to take their place and qualified for the final where they faced a team from the newly reunified Germany. Goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort secured a 2–0 victory for the Danes in their first and only European final. Wembley Stadium hosted the final of the 1996 tournament, where the Czech Republic and Germany were forced into extra time after an Oliver Bierhoff goal equalised Patrik Berger's penalty for the Czech Republic. Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff scored his and Germany's second, and the first golden goal in the history of the tournament, securing Germany's third European title 2–1. The 2000 tournament was also decided by a golden goal. France, who had won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, met Italy in the Feijnoord Stadion in the Netherlands, both nations making their second appearance in the final. A second-half goal from Marco Delvecchio saw Italy take a 1–0 lead into injury time, when Sylvain Wiltord scored a \"last-gasp\" equaliser to send the match into extra time. David Trezeguet's volley 13 minutes into extra time ensured that France were both European and World champions.\nThe 2004 competition saw, according to UEFA, \"one of the biggest shocks in tournament history\" as Greece defeated hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final. Despite never having won a match in a \"major tournament\", a second-half goal from striker Angelos Charisteas caused \"one of the biggest upsets in soccer history\". Germany qualified for their sixth final in 2008, and faced Spain in a tournament co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland. A first-half strike from Fernando Torres was the only goal of the game, and helped Spain win their first European trophy in 44 years. The 2012 tournament final saw reigning European and World champions Spain face Italy in Kyiv. Two first-half goals, one each from David Silva and Jordi Alba put the defending champions 2–0 ahead at half-time. Fifteen minutes into the second half, and four minutes after being brought on as a substitute, Thiago Motta was stretchered off as Italy were reduced to ten men for the remainder of the second half. Fernando Torres scored a third, becoming the first player to score in two European Championship finals, and then provided an assist for Juan Mata who scored with a minute to go, the final ending 4–0. Spain's third victory in the final equalled Germany as the most successful team in the tournament's history, and they became the first team to defend the European Football Championship title. Portugal became the 10th different team to win the European Championships in 2016, when they beat France 1–0 in the final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis; the match went goalless after 90 minutes, before Eder scored the winning goal four minutes into the second period.\nIn UEFA Euro 2020, which was actually held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, Italy won their second title after beating first-time finalists England on penalties.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "Synchronized Swimming (Bob's Burgers)",
        "text": "\"Synchronized Swimming\" is the third episode of the second season of the animated comedy series \"Bob's Burgers\" and the overall 16th episode, and is written by Holly Schlesinger and directed by Anthony Chun. It aired on Fox in the United States on March 25, 2012.\nPlot.\nLinda is performing prenatal yoga, despite the fact that she has not been pregnant for nine years. The kids call her over from the television to help them with their homework, and Bob chastises Linda for coddling them. Later, Bob shows off his new soft serve ice cream machine to Teddy, dreaming of selling ice cream during the summer months. At school, the children complain about how much they hate gym class, and convince Mr. Frond to allow them to instead have an independent study of synchronized swimming, which they have no intention of actually doing.\nThe next morning, Bob shows the kids how to use the soft serve machine and Linda continues doing things for the kids, including making a Navajo mask for Gene's school project. Bob again chastises Linda for coddling. At school, the kids ditch gym class for their \"independent study\" and have fun around town. At Reflections, Linda runs into Mr. Frond, who mentions the kids' synchronized swimming study supposedly coached by Linda. Back at the restaurant, Linda announces to the children that she will be coaching them in synchronized swimming instead of letting them run around alone.\nLater, Linda takes the kids to the community pool to begin their lessons, and Louise finds numerous ways of staying out of the water. At the restaurant, Bob finds himself swamped attempting to fill in for Linda and dealing with the new soft serve machine. The next day, several more children join the independent study, and Linda quits as coach when they continue to goof off and after Andy and Ollie naïvely blurt out the independent study being made up. The kids think they have gotten out of work, and Mr. Frond finds them to let them know that the school board wishes to watch a performance that afternoon or face summer school. They beg for Linda's help, who refuses, and Bob decides to coach them because he needs them to work there over the summer. At the pool, Louise finds several ways of attempting to get out of the performance, but ultimately fails. Linda arrives at the last minute to help them with a synchronized performance of her prenatal yoga. They receive a D and don't need to go to summer school.\nReception.\nThe episode received a 2.0 rating and was watched by a total of 3.97 million people. This made it the fourth most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating \"The Cleveland Show\", but losing to \"American Dad!\", and repeats of \"The Simpsons\" and \"Family Guy\" with 4.57 million. Rowan Kaiser of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B+, saying \"Tonight’s episode had far more than the normal amount of these fanciful extended cutaways. And they were all, by and large, good. Bob’s visions of floating off into happyland based on his new soft-serve machine were good stuff, as were the kids’ remembrances of gym class (especially Tina getting hit in the head with a ball). There were just significantly more than usual. As a one-time thing, this could work. As a strategy for the show moving forward? I’m not so sure.\""

        "text": "Bowling was featured in the Summer Olympic Games demonstration programme in 1988 in at the Seoul's Royal Bowling Center on 18 September 1988. A total of 20 nations competed in the men's and women's tournament. No bowling professionals competed in the demonstration events.\nPost-1988 lobby.\nThe first multi-sport event in which bowling was contested as an official sport was the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok, Thailand. Bowling has been an official sport at every quadrennial World Games from the first edition in 1981 in the United States, including the 2017 World Games in Wroclaw, Poland. The sport was removed from the Asian Games program for the 1982 Games in Delhi, India, but returned four years later in the 1986 Games in Seoul, South Korea. The public interest in this edition of the Asian Games was resounding. As a result the bowling industry lobbied long and hard for bowling to be recognized as a potential Olympic sport and a demonstration sport for future Games, but the outcome was not successful. A negative factor is that bowling lacks inexpensive or easy access for youth in the underdeveloped world to acquire skill and proficiency. However, after its first demonstration appearance at the Americas-exclusive 1983 Pan American Games, bowling appeared as an official sport with full medal status at the 1991 Pan American Games on August 2, 1991, in Havana, Cuba. The medal-level competition has been held at every Pan American Games since then, including the 2019 Games held in Lima, Peru.\nSport for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nOn 22 June 2015, it was announced that bowling made the cut from the 28 sports to the last eight to become a new sport for the 2020 Summer Olympics. The shortlist of these sports for consideration was based on applications from 26 international sport federations, many of which have applied for inclusion in previous Olympic tournaments. However, in September 2015, it was announced that bowling, together with wushu and squash, were left out for 2020. The 2020 Olympic Committee wanted sports that appealed to youth and that did not require building new facilities to reduce cost."

It is the premier championship of the formula and the winner is granted the honour of racing with a gold roof and wing until the next World Final, and if desired they can race under number 1.\nQualification.\nThe World Final is usually held in September. The host tracks, all of which are based in the UK, are decided by the BriSCA promoters.\nThe grid for the World Final is mostly composed of drivers from the UK who are chosen through a series of qualifying rounds and two World Championship Semi-Finals. Drivers who fail to progress from the World Semi-Finals may race again in a Consolation Semi-Final to choose two more entrants, and the reigning World Champion is entitled to start at the rear of the grid if they have not already qualified. The UK drivers are joined by stock car drivers from the Netherlands, and by invited drivers in the nearest equivalent motorsport formulas from other countries often including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA.\nThe most successful driver in World Final races is John Lund, who has won eight. Other notable multiple winners include Stuart Smith (six), Andy Smith (five), Peter Falding and Tom Harris (four), Johnny Brise, Dave Chisholm and Frankie Wainman Junior (three).\nList of winners.\nThere were two races promoted as the World Championship in 1955, at Harringay and Belle Vue.\nAll drivers are British, except where marked."

        "text": "Jacob William Ryan (born February 27, 1992) is a former American football linebacker. He played college football at Michigan. He was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 2015 NFL draft.\nEarly years.\nIn high school, Ryan was rated as the 30th best high school football inside linebacker in the country by Rivals.com. He was rated as the 60th and 81st best outside linebacker in the national class of 2010 by ESPN.com and Scout.com, respectively. He was regarded as the 34th best player in the state of Ohio by Rivals. Ryan was a participant in the Ohio North–South All-Star game. He recovered the onside kick to secure the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) championship as a junior. Ryan had offers from Ball State, Toledo and a number of other Mid-American Conference, but he grew and prior to his senior year. Since Saint Ignatius High School has many Michigan Wolverine alumni, Ryan suspects that sudden late interest from Michigan was prompted by one of them.\nCollege career.\nRyan redshirted his freshman year for the 2010 Michigan Wolverines football team. As a redshirt freshman, he started in the September 3 opener for the 2011 team against Western Michigan as a result of a back injury to Cam Gordon. In the game, Ryan deflected a pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. He went on to start 11 games and play in all 13. On September 24, 2011, against new head coach Brady Hoke's former team, San Diego State, Ryan had two fumble recoveries. His first career quarterback sack came on October 1 in the Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. It was his only sack that year until the final game of the season. In the January 3, 2012 Sugar Bowl 23–20 overtime victory against Virginia Tech, Ryan had 4 tackles for a loss, including one sack and one 22-yard loss by David Wilson. During the game, he had his season-high 7 tackles (6 solo). For the season, he earned 2011 Big Ten Conference All-Freshman team recognition from both ESPN.com and BTN.com as well as 2011 Rivals.com 2nd team All-Freshman and College Football News All-Freshman honorable mention honors. Ryan finished among the conference leaders in tackles for a loss/game (.85, t-15th).\nPrior to the second game of the 2012 season against Air Force, Ryan's number was changed from 90 to 47 following a ceremony for Bennie Oosterbaan in which his retired number was placed back into circulation as a Michigan Football Legend jersey.

Ryan was named an All-Big Ten second-team selection by the media and an honorable mention selection by the coaches.\nDuring Spring practice in 2013, Ryan tore his anterior cruciate ligament. When Ryan was initially injured in the spring, there was no official diagnosis of his expected return to football, but ACL injuries typically require a year to fully heal. By August Ryan was expected to return to the field in mid October. On August 25, 2013, he was named one of four team co-captains along with Taylor Lewan, Courtney Avery, and Cam Gordon.

He was an honorable mention selection to the 2014 College Football All-America Team by \"Sports Illustrated\". He won The Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's top linebacker in 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn December 13, 2014, it was announced that Ryan had accepted his invitation to play in the 2015 East–West Shrine Game.

        "title": "Australian Rugby League Commission",
        "text": "The Australian Rugby League Commission (ARL), formerly the Australian Rugby Football League known as the Australian Rugby League is an Australian rugby league football competition operator. It was founded in 1986 as the Australian Rugby Football League Limited and succeeded the Australian Rugby Football League Board of Control which had been formed in 1924. Since its inception, the ARL has administered the Australian national team and represented Australia in international rugby league matters. Prior to 1998, the code in Australia had been principally administered by individual state leagues on a domestic basis, and the ARL on a national and international basis.\nCompetitions.\nThe ARL controls the National Rugby League and National Youth Competition as well as annual representative competitions such as the State of Origin series, the Indigenous All Stars Match, City vs Country Origin and the Affiliated States Championship.\nHistory.\nRugby league started in Australia in the period 1907–08.\nThe Australian Rugby Football League Board of Control was formed by the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) and Queensland Rugby League (QRL) in December 1924 to administer the running of the national team. George Ball was the first secretary of the Board and John La Maro the first chairman. Prior to this time, the international rugby league was organised jointly by the NSWRL and the QRL. It was only after this time that the Australian team began to wear the now-familiar sporting colours of Green and Gold. Since 1924, rugby league bodies in all other states and territories became affiliated to the Board of Control and ARL.\nUntil 1984 the ARFL Board of Control was effectively run by the NSWRL board, and many Queensland players and administrators throughout this period believed that the NSWRL used this power to the detriment of Queenslanders, especially with respect to national team selection. In 1986 the ARL was incorporated under the name Australian Rugby Football League Limited as a separate entity and Ken Arthurson was the first executive chairman of the new body.\nWith national expansion of the competition implemented for the 1995 season the NSWRL passed control of the Winfield Cup competition to the ARL.\nFollowing Kerry Packer's announcement that his Optus Vision company owned both free-to-air and pay television broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia, News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, undertook a bold bid to create a rival competition, Super League (Australia). Super League successfully attracted eight of the ARL clubs.\nIn the 1995 State of Origin series, the ARL forbade the players of those eight clubs from participating in the interstate competition. However, those clubs were allowed to participate in the premiership seasons of 1995 and 1996, while the ARL fought in the courtroom to stop the Super League competition from eventuating. However, Super League conducted a rival competition in 1997.\nBoth the ARL and Super League competitions ran parallel to each other that year. At the close of the season, despite having the financial backing of Optus, the ARL decided that it could not survive if two competitions were run and undertook moves to approach News Corporation and join the national competition that had been created by Super League. As a consequence of the negotiations that followed, the National Rugby League was formed before the 1998 season from the ARL and Super League competitions.\nFrom 1998 to 2012, the National Rugby League Partnership, a power-sharing arrangement between News Corporation and the Australian Rugby League (ARL), ran the National Rugby League competition as a consequence of the Super League war. Between the 1998 season and the first few months of the 2012 season the ARL had six out of twelve seats on the NRL Partnership board. In 2012 News Limited exited the partnership on condition that the ARL was restructured with an independent board.\nThe ARL was renamed as the Australian Rugby League Commission and restructured on 10 February 2012 and took control of the National Rugby League competition.\nARL Premiership, 1995-97.\nFrom 1995 to 1997, the ARL directly administered the national club premiership competition. Although they only won one ARL premiership in 1996, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles dominated the competition in its three years under the ARL name, winning each minor premiership (1995-1997), and appearing in all three Grand Finals.\nARL Development.\nARL Development is a non-profit company that was formed by the ARL to develop the sport from an introductory level to the age of 18 years. In achieving this, ARL Development has developed new modified codes that gradually introduce children to rugby league. This is done by restricting the rules and then gradually releasing these restrictions.\nThe two introductory modified codes currently in use are \"mini footy\" and \"mod league\". On completion of mod league, players make a move to full international rugby league laws.\nOrganisation structure.\nThe ARL Commission is the peak governing body of rugby league football in Australia. It is headquartered in Sydney at Rugby League Central, Moore Park, New South Wales.\nAll 17 National Rugby League clubs and the New South Wales Rugby League and the Queensland Rugby League are members of the commission. This means that the commission has 19 shareholder members in total.\nPrimary Objects.\nThe primary objects of the ARL are to:\nCommissioners.\nThe appointment of the original nine commissioners was intensely followed by the media. Placement firm Spencer Stuart shortlisted a list of potential members and the NRL Partnership whittled it down to the current members. Commissioners were required to not have had any link to any rugby league football governing body or organisation for the previous 2 years to ensure their independence.\nThe inaugural ARL Commissioners were agreed by representatives of the NRL Partnership, the Leagues and the NRL clubs. Future Commissioners are appointed by the Commission itself.\nElection of Commissioners.\nThe Commissioners are appointed into different groups and, initially, for differing terms. Each Commissioner must, at a nominated time, resign and seek re-election at an Annual General Meeting.\nCommissioners in Group A must stand down before the 2013 Annual General Meeting, where they may re-apply for their position. Group B members must stand down before the 2014 AGM and Group C members must stand down before the 2015 meeting.\nTen members may, with the additional support of both the NSW and Queensland Rugby Leagues, vote to remove a Commissioner.\nFourteen members are required to remove a Commissioner without the support of both the NSW and Queensland Rugby Leagues. Should either of these events occur, the remaining Commissioners would appoint a replacement.\nA Commissioner who has been removed from office may not seek re-appointment for a period of three years.\nPeter Beattie Commissioner A\nFormer commissioners.\nDavid Gallop was the initial chief executive officer of the restructured ARL Commission. He was previously the CEO of the NRL and his contract extension to become inaugural ARL CEO was a condition placed by News Limited with the ARL. On 5 June 2012 the ARL announced Gallop's departure from the CEO position and he will take a position at the FFA in 2013. David Smith was announced as the new ARL CEO in November 2012, taking charge on 1 February 2013.\nGary Pemberton, a former chairman of Qantas, Billabong and Racing NSW, and one of the seven commissioners appointed to the newly restructured ARL in February 2012, announced in July 2013 that he would retire from his role on 31 October."

        "title": "Copa América Centenario",
        "text": "The Copa América Centenario (, , ; literally \"Centennial America Cup\") was an international men's soccer tournament that was hosted by the United States in 2016. The competition was a celebration of the centenary of CONMEBOL and the Copa América, and was the first Copa América hosted outside South America.\nThe tournament was a commemorative version of Copa América (not the 45th edition). It was held as part of an agreement between CONMEBOL and CONCACAF as a special edition between the usual four-year cycle, and featured an expanded field of sixteen teams (an increase from the usual twelve), with all ten teams from CONMEBOL and six teams from CONCACAF. Despite the tournament being an official iteration of the Copa América, the winner would not receive an invitation to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup due to the commemorative nature of the tournament, although eventual winners Chile had already qualified through their 2015 victory.\nChile became the fourth nation to win at least two consecutive titles in CONMEBOL tournaments, after Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. Argentina, meanwhile, lost their third consecutive final in a major tournament, following losses to Germany at the 2014 World Cup and Chile at the 2015 Copa América.\nPlanning.\nIn February 2012, Alfredo Hawit, then Acting President of CONCACAF, announced that the competition would be expected to take place in 2016, as a celebration of CONMEBOL's centenary.\nCONMEBOL President Nicolás Leoz said \"Hopefully we can organize a big event, because we're 100 years old and we want to celebrate big.\"\nThe tournament was announced by CONMEBOL on October 24, 2012 and confirmed by CONCACAF on May 1, 2014.\nOn September 26, 2014, FIFA announced that the tournament had been added to the FIFA International Match Calendar, meaning that clubs had to release players called up to the competition.\nThe tournament occurred in June 2016, along with UEFA Euro 2016.\nSports executive corruption.\nThe tournament was placed in doubt after several high-profile sports executive arrests were made including people involved with media rights holder Datisa (using the trading name of \"Wematch\"), a partnership between three media rights companies; Full Play, Torneos and Traffic Sports Marketing. In December 2014, Brazilian José Hawilla, the owner and founder of Traffic Sports pled guilty to \"corruption charges including racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering\". In an indictment, the FBI stated that officials were to receive bribes totalling US$20million for the 2016 event. Datisa held agreements for the commercial rights with CONMEBOL and CONCACAF and had their bank account frozen placing the tournament in jeopardy. On October 21, 2015, CONCACAF announced that they had terminated their agreement with Datisa.\nOn October 23, 2015, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL and the hosting association U.S. Soccer Federation all confirmed that the tournament was going ahead as originally intended.\nTrophy.\nA new trophy was supposed to be created for the tournament and was to be unveiled on July 4, 2015, at the 2015 Copa América final. No trophy was unveiled amidst the FIFA corruption scandal.\nHowever, CONMEBOL announced that, on April 28, 2016, a presentation for the trophy would take place in Bogotá, Colombia.\nOn April 28, 2016, it was explained on the Copa América website that the \"new\" trophy was in fact commemorative, and would only be given to the winning country to keep, while the original silver trophy would continue to be awarded to each winner of the tournament (including the 2016 winner). The Centenario trophy retains the silhouette of the original trophy's Grecian urn, but is plated in matte gold. The front of the trophy is adorned with a raised (and in the case of some parts of the logo, engraved) image of the Copa América Centenario wordmark and logo. On each side are raised and polished images of a connected North and South America, commemorating the first Copa América held outside South America. Instead of the traditional wooden base holding the names of all past winners, the base of the Centenario commemorative trophy includes 16 zones, in which the names of all 16 nations are engraved. Other details include: The logos of both CONMEBOL and CONCACAF (the two confederations with representatives in the tournament), the years \"1916–2016\" (commemorating the 100 years of CONMEBOL and Copa América), and the phrases \"La Copa del Siglo\" (\"The Cup of the Century\") and \"Uniting the Americas\".\nHost selection.\nLuis Chiriboga, the President of the Ecuadorian Football Federation stated the United States and Mexico were potential hosts of at least one stage of the competition.\nHawit preferred the competition to be hosted in the United States for financial reasons, stating that \"the market is in the United States, the stadiums are in the United States, the people are in the United States. The study that we have made [shows] that everything’s in the United States.\" In July 2012, CONCACAF President Jeffrey Webb stated there was much organizing to be done.\nOn May 1, 2014, it was announced that the tournament would be held in the United States from June 3–26, 2016.\nThe decision to select the U.S. as a host was the object of criticism by Uruguay Football Association president Wilmar Valdez on June 7, 2016, who complained that the U.S. is \"a country where they don't feel football\", which \"brings about problems.\" The complaint was voiced after Uruguay's defeat against Mexico, in favor of whom, he said, the event was biased. Just prior to the game itself, the Chilean anthem was mistakenly played instead of the Uruguayan anthem.\nVenues.\nOn January 8, 2015, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL announced the 24 U.S. metropolitan areas which had indicated interest in hosting matches.\nThe stadiums were chosen following a bidding process, with the minimum capacity to be 50,000. The final list of venues, anticipated to number between 8 and 13, was to be announced in May 2015. However, the list was not released and speculation regarding whether the tournament will be able to move forward arose because Interpol red notices were issued for the former presidents of the CONMEBOL and CONCACAF confederations in relation to the 2015 FIFA corruption case, including allegations that they accepted significant bribes in relation to the $112.5 million broadcasting deal for the event. However, officials from CONMEBOL expressed a desire to move forward with the event despite the scandal.\nOn November 19, 2015, the ten venues selected for the tournament were announced by CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, and U.S. Soccer Federation.\nParticipating teams.\nAt the official announcement of the tournament, CONMEBOL and CONCACAF confirmed that all ten CONMEBOL members would be joined by six CONCACAF teams in the tournament. Among CONCACAF teams, the United States and Mexico automatically qualified. The other four spots were given to Costa Rica, the champions of the Central American Football Union by winning the 2014 Copa Centroamericana, Jamaica, the champions of the Caribbean Football Union by winning the 2014 Caribbean Cup, and Haiti and Panama, the two play-off winners among the four highest finishers in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup not already qualified.\nDraw.\nThe group seeds and match schedule were announced on December 17, 2015. The United States (Group A) were seeded as host, while Argentina (Group D) were seeded as the highest FIFA-ranked team in the CONMEBOL region during December 2015. According to Soccer United Marketing, Brazil (Group B) and Mexico (Group C) were seeded as they were \"the most decorated nations in the last 100 years in international competitions from their respective confederations\". However, there was criticism for not including Uruguay, which won two World Cups and was the Copa América all-time leader with 15 championships, or Chile, which were the defending Copa América champions going into the tournament.\nThe draw took place on February 21, 2016, at 7:30 pm EST, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Teams were seeded using the FIFA Ranking from December 2015.\nThe four group pots contained four positions each, one from each group, as follows:\nSquads.\nEach country had a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) which had to be submitted before the deadline of May 20, 2016.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of Copa América Centenario took place at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara 9:00 pm EDT () on June 3, 2016, ahead of the opening match and featured musical performances by Colombian singer J Balvin, American singer Jason Derulo and the Canadian band Magic!\nGroup stage.\nAll times are EDT (). The top two teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of each team in each group was determined as follows:\nKnockout stage.\nIn the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and third place match of the knockout stage, a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner if tied after 90 minutes. In the final, extra time and a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner if necessary. Should the final enter extra time, a fourth substitute would be allowed as part of FIFA's approval of rule changes based on IFAB's new regulations, however neither teams in the final ended up taking advantage of this rule.\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\nChile's Eduardo Vargas received the Golden Boot award for scoring six goals. In total, 91 goals were scored by 62 different players, with three of them credited as own goals.\nAwards.\nIndividual awards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.\nTeam of the Tournament.\nThe Technical Study Group announced the tournament's Best XI squad.\nMarketing.\nMatch ball.\nThe Nike Ordem Ciento was announced as the official Copa América Centenario match ball on February 21, 2016. The mainly white ball has red brush stroke decoration. It shows the official Copa América Centenario logo.\nThe Nike Ordem Campeón was used for the final match, in which golden brushes replaced the red ones.\nControversies.\nNational anthems, country names, and flags.\nOn June 5, during the pre-match ceremony between Mexico and Uruguay, the national anthem of Chile was played for Uruguay. Many Uruguayan players seemed confused. The correct anthem was never played. Copa América organizers released the following statement via Twitter:This evening during the pre-match ceremony, due to human error, we inadvertently played the incorrect National Anthem [sic]. We sincerely apologize to the Uruguayan Federation, the Uruguay National Team, the people of Uruguay and to the fans for this mistake. We will work with all parties involved to ensure such an error this does not occur again.\nUruguayan midfielder Diego Fagúndez said the incident showed \"much disrespect\".\nOn June 6, Colombian nationals heavily criticized Adidas for misspelling the country name in an advertisement, substituting \"Columbia\" for \"Colombia\". The company said in a statement: \"We value our partnership with the Colombian Football Federation and apologize for our mistake. We removed the graphics and are quickly installing new versions.\"\nAlso on June 6, before the game between Panama and Bolivia, the video screens of the Citrus Bowl in Orlando displayed the flags of both countries, but Bolivia's was inverted.\nMatch officiating.\nOn June 4, during the game between Ecuador and Brazil, the assistant referee called the ball out prior to a cross that led to the ball going into the net for Ecuador. Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson dropped the ball, and it went over the line into his own goal. The replays seemed to show the ball was not completely out of bounds before being crossed, but the goal did not stand. The match ended in a 0–0 draw.\nOn June 10, during the game between Chile and Bolivia, a penalty kick was awarded to Chile after Luis Alberto Gutiérrez was whistled for a handball. The assistant referee made the call, but it appeared that Gutiérrez had tucked his arm behind his back, and the ball hit off his shoulder. Arturo Vidal converted the ensuing penalty at the 90'+10' mark (eight minutes of stoppage time were added to the second half due to an injury to Ronald Eguino) to secure the three points for Chile.\nOn June 12, during the game between Peru and Brazil, Raúl Ruidíaz scored by guiding the ball into the net with his arm. After a lengthy discussion between the referee and his assistant, the goal was allowed to stand, and Brazil went on to lose 1–0, resulting in their elimination from the tournament. However, Raúl Ruidíaz claimed the ball hit his thigh rather than his hand and said the goal was 'thanks to God' rather than another hand of God.\nTicket pricing.\nThe tournament's organizers have been criticized for setting high ticket prices that have resulted in under-capacity crowds in Seattle and Chicago for United States matches. The average price for a sold ticket during the group stage was $144; some matches saw average prices as high as $236 and as low as $37."

        "text": "The year 1931 in tennis was a complex mixture of mainly amateur tournaments composed of international, invitational, national, exhibition, team (city leagues, country leagues, international knock-out tournaments) events and joined by an up-and-coming Pro Tour both on competitive and exhibitional levels.\nAt the end of the pro season the champion title was awarded. Bill Tilden held the title at the end of the year. He also ran his own pro organization called the \"Tilden Tennis Tours\" and toured the world with a series of pro exhibition-like matches. The European professionals of Germany, France, Britain, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland founded the International Federation of Professionists and Professionals headed by Roman Najuch to represent their interest against the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF). There were a few occasional professionals against amateur challenges as well held in team competition format. The amateur events were almost all co-educated thus the majority included a mixed title contest. Irishman George Lyttleton-Rogers dominated the European scene winning eight singles titles, all of which were confined to French and Italian championships. Ellsworth Vines was the dominant male player on the North American tour. The women's most successful players were Miss Elizabeth Ryan in North America and Cilly Aussem in Europe and in South America. Australian tennis life was figureheaded by Jack Crawford.\nThe most prestigious team cups were the Wightman Cup for ladies and the Davis Cup (called the International Lawn Tennis Challenge) for men. The 1931 Wightman Cup was its 9th edition and was organized by the United States Tennis Association between the teams of Great Britain and the United States. The 1931 International Lawn Tennis Challenge was its 26th edition and was organized by the ILTF. The Americas Zone was split into the North/Central American Zone and the South American Zone. The winner of each sub-zone would play to determine who moved to the Inter-Zonal round. 22 teams entered the Europe Zone, while 7 participated in the Americas Zone. The United States defeated Argentina in the American Zone, but would then lose to Great Britain in the Inter-Zonal play-off. France defeated Great Britain in the Challenge Round, giving France their fifth straight title. The final was played at Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, on 24–26 July.\nLegend.\n\"This list includes men and women international tournaments (where at least several different nations were represented), main (annual) national championships, professional tour events and the Davis Cup\"\nRankings.\nThese are the rankings compiled published in the Swiss newspaper \"Züricher Sport\" in October 1931, a second list based upon the ranks of Pierre Gillou, President of the Fédération Française de Tennis, and a third by A Wallis Myers, founder of the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain."

Legs 1 and 2 are done by the women, legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are 6 km and men's legs are 7.5 km., Every athlete leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race.), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots at the lane in the position they arrived (Arrive at the range in 5th place, you shoot at lane five.)."

He was used as a pinch runner, and did not get an at bat.\nBiography.\nTaylor made his sole major league appearance with the Chicago White Sox. On May 3, 1923, the White Sox were hosting the St. Louis Browns. In the bottom of the eighth inning, with the Browns holding a 5–2 lead, Chicago starting pitcher Ted Blankenship was removed from the batting order and replaced by back-up catcher Roy Graham. Graham reached base on a hit by pitch from Browns pitcher Dave Danforth. Graham was then replaced by Taylor, who entered the game as a pinch runner. Danforth then proceeded to retire Harry Hooper, Hervey McClellan and Eddie Collins, leaving Taylor stranded at first base. For the top of the ninth inning, Taylor was replaced by Mike Cvengros, who entered the game to pitch. Chicago went on to lose the game, 6–3.\nBaseball records for Taylor only list him as playing for one minor league team, the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League in 1926, when he appeared in 56 games (49 as a shortstop) with a .253 batting average. The Seals team that season featured former White Sox pitcher Dickie Kerr and future major league stars Dolph Camilli and Earl Averill. Newspaper reports from when Taylor joined the Seals, and several years later, mention him playing in the Pacific Northwest, apparently in semi-professional leagues.\nTaylor died in Seattle at the age of 81 and was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery."

The program also staved off elimination as a varsity program in 2011 by raising approximately 10 million dollars in a little more than a month. The funds raised were able to keep the California baseball program running and set up the Cal Baseball Foundation to try to keep the program running into perpetuity. The university also had planned to eliminate Rugby, Men's and Women's Gymnastics, and Women's Lacrosse, but enough funds were raised to save those programs as well.\nSchedule.\nThe season for California will begin on Friday, February 17 with a home game against Pacific with a three-game series, two of which will be in Berkeley. Their longest home stand will be from March 13–22, and May 11–20 (8 home games), and their longest road trip was from March 20-April 7 (12 road games). Their final game of the regular season will be on Saturday, May 27 in Palo Alto against arch-rival Stanford.

        "title": "California Golden Bears women's volleyball",
        "text": "The California Golden Bears volleyball team is the intercollegiate women's volleyball team of the University of California, Berkeley. The team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was built on top of the old Harmon Gymnasium using money donated in part by the owners of Levi-Strauss. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through massive renovations, which displaced the team for two seasons. The California volleyball program has seen great success in recent years, reaching the final four in 2007, winning the Pac-10 championship in 2010, and finishing as the runner-up in the NCAA tournament in 2010. The current head coach is Sam Crosson, who began his tenure in 2019.\nHistory.\nGolden Age (2007–2010).\nIn 2007, Cal reached the final four for the first time in school history before falling to eventual national champion Penn State in the semifinals. Not only did they reach the final four, in their run they were able to defeat defending champion and #2 seed Nebraska, who were the favorites to repeat as champions, in the regional final round, in a sweep (3–0).\nIn that same year, Senior outside hitter Angie Pressey, the daughter of NBA player Paul Pressey, garnered AVCA First Team All-American honors and was the only Cal player in history to be named to the Pac-10 All-Conference team all four years. Hana Cutura was named the 2007 regional MVP for her helping Cal reach the final four.\nIn 2008 and 2009, the Bears got back to the NCAA tournament, but failed to reach their 2007 success due to 3–0 losses to Penn State in the Elite Eight.\nCal completed its most successful season in 2010, as they won the Pac-10 title for the first time in school history and advanced to the 2010 NCAA Championship final, where they fell to Penn State. Senior setter Carli Lloyd was named the 2010 AVCA National Player of the Year and then head coach Rich Feller was named the National Coach of the Year.\nStruggles, rebuild, and coaching change (2011–2017).\nThe Bears failed to replicate their 2010 success the following year despite going 27–7 during the regular season. They made the NCAA tournament, but lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the first round, ending their season.\n2012 was a similar season for the Bears, as their season ended with yet another first round loss in the tournament to North Carolina. They finally were able to make it past the first round of the tournament vs the Heels the following season, but were swept by the Wisconsin Badgers.\nFrom 2014 to 2016, the Bears struggled, finishing last in the Pac-12 two of those years despite having strong players like Janelle Jordan and Lara Vukasovic. Despite the additions of star freshmen Maddie Haynes, Kat Knop, and Bailee Huizenga for the 2016 season, the struggles continued. After a disappointing 2016 season, which saw the Bears going 9–21 on the year, Feller announced his retirement, and his assistant Matt McShane took over as head coach.\nMcShane's first season as head coach did not go well, even with the addition of star recruits in outside hitter Mima Mirkovic, middle blockers Preslie Anderson and Lauren Forte, and transfer libero Emma Smith. While the former two and star senior outside hitter Christine Alftin did well, the team struggled with injuries to many of their star players, including Alftin and Smith, which left them out of the NCAA tournament for a third straight year. McShane was terminated towards the end of the season, forcing associate head coach Jennifer Dorr to take the helm, which she did through the 2018 season.\nImprovements and second coaching change (2018).\nDorr had a goal to return to the NCAA tournament and gain the Bears' reputation as a good team back. Mirkovic had an outstanding season, with 15 double-doubles on the year and 3.46 kills/set, the most on the team, along with 405 kills. Coach Dorr implored a 6–2 offense, with sophomore Isabel Potter and freshman Jade Blevins at setter, while making Smith their primary libero. Despite the success of Mirkovic and their new freshmen, notably Blevins, libero Gabby Bellizzi, and middle blocker Bella Bergmark, the Bears missed the tournament for a fourth straight year despite finishing only one game below .500.\nAfter signing two recruits: Turkish outside hitter Deniz Milli and Villa Park High School opposite Sydney Lilomaiava that November, Dorr was left searching for a job as the Bears went on looking for a permanent coach. Dorr was not considered to take over the job, as Cal athletic director Jim Knowlton had other plans for their situation in order to help them return to national prominence.\nBeginning of Sam Crosson Era (2019).\nOn December 20, 2018, Knowlton announced that Cal had hired Sam Crosson as the new head coach of the program. Crosson already had connections to the program, as he was an assistant under Feller for the 2010 and '11 seasons before spending 7 years as the head coach of Cal Poly. He kept Dorr on as his associate, and the Bears improved drastically. They went 10–0 in non conference play before losing to Stanford in Haas, then went on to win the next 7 games to improve to 17–1, with their biggest win coming against then-18th ranked Utah Utes. Mirkovic put down 18 kills and scored the game winning kill in that game. In the game against Colorado two days later, she had a career-high 19 kills, including another game-winner. It led to her receiving Cal's second PAC 12 offensive player of the Week honor. She was awarded the AVCA National Player of the Week honor that same week, the first player to earn the award since Carli Lloyd in 2010 and the fourth player overall, joining Lloyd ('08 and '10), Mia Jerkov ('02), and Cutura ('09), cementing herself as one of Cal's legends. After losses to UCLA and USC in LA and Oregon at home, the Bears won three more games, reaching their first 20-win season since 2013, which made it very likely that they would come back to the NCAA tournament.\nUnfortunately, during the first set of the team's penultimate home game against UCLA, Mirkovic took a shot to the head off a kill from UCLA's outside hitter Jenny Mosser, but remained in the game. Towards the end of the first set, while going up for a kill, she went down with an ankle injury, which led her to miss four games. The Bears lost both the UCLA game 3–0 and their Senior Day game against USC 3–1 despite Haynes' 20 kills in the latter game, and couldn't get the season sweep of Colorado and Utah on the road in 3–1 losses.\nDespite Mirkovic's return against Washington, the Bears lost both that game and the game against Stanford, ending their season 20–10 overall, 10–10 in conference. Because only the top six Pac-12 teams make NCAA's, the Bears missed it for a fifth straight year, just one spot shy of sixth place. Despite the disappointing end to the season, it was the first time that Cal was ever in the top 25 since 2013, with their highest ranking being 14th in the country during the middle of the season. Mirkovic finished with 13 double-doubles, the eighth most in the Pac-12, along with 325 kills (.242 hitting and 3.28 kills/set), 20 aces, and 289 digs, putting her six kills shy of 1000, and was named to the AVCA Pacific North All-Region team. Along with Anderson and Forte, she was also named to the All-Pac 12 team, while Haynes received an honorable mention.\nThe loss of Haynes, Huizenga, Smith, and Rennie were tough for Cal, but they signed six freshmen and Arizona transfer Katie Smoot to the roster during the off-season that was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott announced the postponement of all fall sports due to the pandemic, both Anderson and Forte announced via social media that they were a semester away from graduating and were transferring to Baylor and Florida, respectively for next season. The announcements came as a big blow for Cal, as they were left with only two middles whom were inexperienced, putting pressure on Mirkovic and Potter to stay with the team.\nCOVID season (2020).\nIn November 2020, Scott announced that the 2020 PAC-12 volleyball season would be played in spring 2021, on a 22-game conference only schedule. Though Cal appeared to be the team that would improve from last season and make the NCAA tournament, Crosson announced that Potter was staying, but also stated that Mirkovic and Smoot, who play both indoor and beach volleyball, were opting out to play beach. In turn, it forced newly signed freshman Kat Pantovic and the other newcomers to fill the holes left by their departure and the departure of Anderson and Forte at the end of last season. During the first series vs UCLA, Pantovic, Lilomaiava, and middle blocker Lydia Grote gave their all for the team, but it was all for naught as Cal lost the first game of the series 3–1 and were swept in the second, which was very reminiscent of last season. The series against Utah wasn't much better, as the middles were shut down in both games despite Grote's 9 kills in the first game, and Pantovic's absence from the second game due to a pulled muscle did not help their cause. \nIn the series against Colorado, Cal came knocking on the door and forced the game to 5 sets, but ended up losing despite stellar performances from Pantovic and Lilomaiava. It didn't help that libero Tara Desa had gone on COVID protocol and that starting libero Lexi Gruszczynski and backup setter Blevins were injured. The team could not replicate their efforts in the second game, losing 3–0, as errors and poor hitting efficiency doomed the Bears, who were unable to stop the Buffs' Elissa Alcantara and Sterling Parker. Aside from Lilomaiava's 7 kills, everyone else did not do that well, a sign that losing Mirkovic was going to make it hard for them to replicate their 2019 success. On February 12, 2021, Cal managed to beat a depleted Stanford team in Haas in 5 sets behind Pantovic's first double-double (16 kills, 11 digs) and Bergmark's .348 hitting percentage for their first win of the season and their first win vs Stanford since 2011. They could not complete the sweep two days later, losing in straight sets to split the series with the Cardinal due to poor defense and Stanford's blocking prowess. The USC series, despite being a hard-fought one, resulted in 3–1 losses both times for the Bears, dropping them further down the standings. In the series against Washington State, the Bears were swept both times, dropping to 1–11 on the season despite having an overall winning record against the Cougars. Though they fought hard both times, the WSU block stifled Cal despite Grote's 11 kills in the second game, proving that Cal's NCAA hopes seemed all but impossible. To make matters worse, Potter injured her left hand in the second game of the series while going up for a block, leaving her unable to set, and Bellizzi was also injured in the first game of the series as well, forcing fellow libero Jessica Houghton to take over at the position. Potter's absence forced freshman Kendall Jensen to take the reins at setter and the Bears suffered uncharacteristic losses (3–2 in game 1 and 3–0 in game 2) to the OSU Beavers, a team they have a winning record against, despite strong performances by Grote in both games. Pantovic recorded her second double-double in the first game, but had only 6 kills and 7 digs in the second to go with her first solo block, and Lilomaiava's poor performance in game 2 of the series didn't help their cause. The series vs the ASU Sun Devils wasn't much better despite Grote's 13 kills in the second game, resulting in 3–0 sweep losses both times. Pantovic did uncharacteristically poor in both games, and Lilomaiava struggled to find consistency offensively, which did not help despite her improved blocking numbers.\nBecause the Bears were able to win at home before, it was thought that they would be able to take down Arizona at Haas, but they were again swept 3–0 both times despite Grote's double-digit kill performances in both games. Cal's offense struggled, as Bergmark, Pantovic and Lilomaiava could not find consistency at the net and were unable to stop the Wildcats' offensive firepower outsides Sofia Maldonado Diaz and Paige Whipple. It was clear that Potter's injury was the nail in the coffin in an already disappointing season for the Bears, and Jensen's inexperience was making it even harder for them as a team to produce the way they could before Potter went down. Despite stellar performances from Pantovic and Grote, the Blue and Gold could not get past a red-hot Oregon lineup, losing the series in 3–0 sweeps. They couldn't regain a winning momentum against UW in their last games of the season, losing both games 3–0 despite strong performances from Meyer and Grote. This left them with a season-worst 1–21 record, one that would have probably not existed given better circumstances. In spite of that, Grote was named to the Pac 12 All-freshman team, making her the only Bear to receive honors in the spring 2021 (2020) season.\nPandemic season (2021–).\nThe loss of Potter and Houghton were tough for Cal, and Meyer ended up graduating early to pursue a master's degree at Georgetown, which did not help from a veteran standpoint. However, Mirkovic announced that she would be returning for the fall 2021 season. The team also signed Utah transfer Leah Schmidt to go with their 4 incoming freshmen that would fill the void left by the losses of Potter and Houghton, as well as the earlier losses of Forte and Anderson in fall 2020. Smoot's name was still listed when the fall 2021 roster came out, which proved that she, too would be back for the Bears in fall 2021. During the games vs Alabama A &amp;M and northwestern state, the bears won two times but lost to Tulane. They beat the pacific tourney teams and Nevada three times, but a loss to ndsu hurt them. Losing to Butler and UC Davis were bad even though they beat St Mary's college 3–1. They ended up losing to Stanford 3–1 despite fighting hard at a raucous Maples pavilion and Mirkovic and Smoot doing well for the team overall, leaving them 0–1 to start conference play and 7–5 overall. An injury to Grote and a concussion protocol injury for Pantovic certainly didn't help them at all, even though both were ok to play. A loss to USC left them 0–2 to start conference matches, as the USC block was too much to handle. They could not regain a win after the home game vs Arizona nor ASU as the Cats were unstoppable the whole night, especially in the front row, and poor defense vs ASU didn't help their cause. Nevertheless, the sets were much closer than vs USC overall. Losses to the Oregon schools did not help their cause, predicting changes by the off-season by an 0–6 conference start. A set of sweep losses to Colorado and Utah did not help them either despite Grote's career and match high 21 kills in the latter game, putting them 0–8 in conference play. In addition, Mirkovic was wearing tape on her left knee vs Utah, a sign she was injured, and was limited to only playing libero or sitting out entirely, so was forced to only be the libero for the match.\nThe series vs the Washington schools was different both times, but the Bears lost to UW 3–1 in a sisterly matchup (Grote and her sister Marin) and 3–0 to a tough-blocking Cougar team, falling to 0–10 on the conference season. An injury to Mirkovic dropped them down to 0–12 after sweep losses to the Arizona schools, and Mirkovic's absence certainly didn't help down the stretch. They still could not get a win vs the Oregon schools, making it likely changes would be in order, and losses to WSU and made things worse.\nSeason-by-season results.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: 2011 Golden Bears Record Book, 2013 Golden Bears Record Book\nRoster.\nCurrent Roster\n⛑-injured\nPostseason.\nThe California Golden Bears have an NCAA Division I Tournament record of 26–17 through seventeen appearances."

        "title": "2013 South Asian Games",
        "text": "The 2013 South Asian Games, officially the XII South Asian Games, was a scheduled multi-sport event to take place in Guwahati and Shillong, India. With this edition of the Games, India became the second country to host the Games three times (the previous editions being held in Kolkata in 1987 and Madras in 1995), after Bangladesh. It was also the first time that Delhi hosted the Games. The Games witnessed a change in the original host country, and faced delays which pushed back the conduct of the Games by several months.\nHost change.\nOriginally, as per tradition of bringing the Games to each and every country of South Asia, Bhutan was selected to host the 12th edition of the Games. However, at the 41st South Asian Olympic Council held at Dhaka in February 2010, Bhutan expressed its inability to host the Games. So, to replace Bhutan, Delhi stepped in as host of the Games. Indian Olympic Association President Suresh Kalmadi officially received the SAG flag in Dhaka after the 11th edition of the Games drew to a close on 9 February 2010. The Sports Ministry of India said, in an official press statement, that Delhi had been chosen as host so that the sport infrastructure built for the 2010 Commonwealth Games remains in use.\nDelay.\nInitially, the Games were expected to be held in October, 2012. However, during the General Body meeting of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) on 16 December 2011, it was decided to postpone the Games to February, 2013. The primary concern highlighted was that the original plan meant that the Games would be held only two months after the 2012 Summer Olympics, a fact which made athletes uncomfortable. In addition, the Delhi Government had stated that \"accommodation would be a problem during October–November\". In April 2012, the IOA sent letters to all the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of South Asia, announcing that the Games will be held for eight days beginning from 13 February 2013; further discussions would take place at an all-NOC meeting in Moscow. President of the Nepal Olympic Committee Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan also reported about the proposed additions of fencing, equestrian, gymnastics and the triathlon to the Games schedule. As of January 2013, host city and dates of the games were not yet confirmed.\nThe International Olympic Committee banned the Indian Committee in March for political interference (the national government played a role in Olympic officials' selection). This delayed the event further as the ban was only lifted in May and the possibility of a low-cost edition of the games was raised among ongoing hosting discussions and poor relations with neighboring Pakistan due to the 2013 India–Pakistan border incidents.\nTwo years later, on 11 February 2014, the International Olympic Committee decided to lift the ban. Up until now, the Indian side competed in Olympic events such as the Winter Olympic Games as independent participants.\nA year later, on 5 June 2015, the uncertainty over the venue to host the 12th South Asian Games ended with the Sports Ministry and Indian Olympic Association deciding to hold the regional multi-sporting event in Guwahati and Shillong in November–December 2015. However, this was postponed even further to a tentative date of February 2016."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London took place at Dorney Lake which, for the purposes of the Games venue, was officially termed Eton Dorney. It was held from 28 July to 3 August. There were 33 competitors from 33 nations. The event was won by Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand, the nation's first victory in the event since 2000. Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic earned his second consecutive silver in the event; Drysdale and Synek were the 13th and 14th men to win multiple medals in the single sculls; they would go on to be the 5th and 6th to earn three in the event in 2016 when Drysdale repeated as champion and Synek added a bronze. The 2012 bronze went to Alan Campbell, Great Britain's first medal in the event since 1928. \nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nNine of the 12 A/B semifinalists from the 2008 Games returned, including the top eight finishers: two-time gold medallist Olaf Tufte of Norway, silver medallist Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic, bronze medallist Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand, fourth-place finisher (and 2004 A finalist) Tim Maeyens of Belgium, fifth-place finisher Alan Campbell of Great Britain, sixth-place finisher Lassi Karonen of Sweden, two-time seventh-place finisher (and 2000 bronze medallist) Marcel Hacker of Germany, eighth-place finisher Mindaugas Griskonis of Lithuania, and eleventh-place finisher Ken Jurkowski of the United States. Drysdale was the favourite again and hoping for better than bronze this time; he had won five of the six World Championships since the 2004 Olympics. Synek was his biggest challenger, having won the 2010 World Championship. The two-time reigning champion, Tufte, was still a strong contender though not at his peak anymore. Campbell had medaled at the last three World Championships and won the 2003, 2007, and 2011 Diamond Challenge Sculls competitions (matching Drysdale's three wins in that event at that point, though Drysdale has won three more since). \nAzerbaijan, Croatia, El Salvador, Niger, and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the event. Great Britain and the United States each made their 21st appearance, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to one boat (one rower) each since 1912. The 33 qualifiers were:\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. The competition expanded to five rounds, keeping the preliminary heats round added in 2008 and restoring the repechage after the first round. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nDuring the first round six heats were held. The first three boats in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechage was a round which offered rowers a second chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. Placing in the repechage heats determined which quarterfinal the boat would race in. The top two boats in each repechage heat moved on to the quarterfinals, with the remaining boats going to the E/F semifinals.\nThe quarterfinals were the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nSix semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the top three of their heat (or top two of their repechage heat), top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to the quarterfinals, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualified for the quarterfinals; the remainder went to Semifinals E/F and were out of medal contention.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first three in each heat qualified for the A/B semifinals; the remainder went to the C/D semifinals and were out of medal contention.\nSemifinals.\nThe first three in each semifinal advanced to the better of the two finals available (E, C, A) while the remaining boats went to the other final (F, D, B)."

        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London took place at Dorney Lake which, for the purposes of the Games venue, was officially termed Eton Dorney. It was held from 28 July to 1 August. There were 8 boats (72 competitors) from 8 nations. The event was won by Germany, the nation's first victory as \"Germany\" (the United Team of Germany, East Germany, and West Germany had combined for 5 gold medals). The German team beat the defending champions Canada, who took silver. Great Britain also slipped one place from their 2008 silver, taking bronze this time.\nBackground.\nThis was the 26th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nGermany was favoured; after a disappointing performance at Beijing (finishing outside the main final), the Germans had taken three straight World Championships. Other contenders included the defending champions (Canada) and the hosts, Great Britain.\nFor the third consecutive Games, no nations made their debut in the event. Seven of the eight teams had competed in all three of those Games, at least; by contrast, Ukraine made its first appearance since 1996. The United States made its 23nd appearance, most among nations to that point.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to one boat each since 1920. The 8 qualifiers were:\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nThe competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals) as well as a repechage. \nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe winners of each heat qualified to the \"A\" final, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first four qualified for the \"A\" final."

        "text": "Colonel John William Russell (February 2, 1920 – September 30, 2020) was an American equestrian who won a bronze medal at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.\nAfter serving in the United States Army during World War II, he began competing in international equestrian tournaments and was eventually selected to join the United States team at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. After his success at the 1952 edition, he continued to participate in events around the world, but military duties and a broken bone in his horse caused him to miss the 1956 Summer Olympics. He retired from active competition that year and became the head of United States Modern Pentathlon Training Center, where he coached six United States Olympic modern pentathlon delegations, twenty-two World Championship teams, and helped organize two World Modern Pentathlon Championships. He retired and opened the Russell Equestrian Center and was inducted into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame in 2001.\nEarly life.\nRussell was born in Dauphin, Pennsylvania. In 1943 he joined the United States Army and served during World War II in Africa, Germany, and Italy. In the latter he was wounded while fighting in Cassino and received the Purple Heart. By the end of the conflict he had attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and acquired numerous decorations, including the Soldier's Medal and the Bronze Star Medal. He then began coaching and riding in Northern Italy in 1946, becoming the first American to capture the equestrian Prize of Nations in 1947.\nCompetitive career.\nIn 1948 Russell was posted to Fort Riley in Kansas to serve as a riding instructor and became a member of the United States national equestrian team. While rewriting the army's Manual of Horsemanship, he found time to compete in that year's Olympic trials, where he placed second, thereby becoming a member of the last American Olympic equestrian delegation to be chosen from the United States Army. At the 1948 Summer Olympics he finished 21st in a field of 44 competitors in the individual jumping event and also helped represent his country in the team tournament, riding his horse Air Mail in both competitions. Although his military squad disbanded as a competitive force following the games, Russell continued to win international championships over the next several years in the lead up to the 1952 Summer Olympics, which was the first United States Olympic equestrian delegation to accept civilians.\nEncouraged by John Wofford, the first president of the United States Equestrian Team and a participant in the 1932 Summer Olympics, Russell participated in the trials to make the 1952 Olympic squad and finished first riding a horse by the name of Democrat. It was with Democrat that Russell, alongside William Steinkraus and Arthur McCashin, captured the bronze medal in the team jumping tournament. He also finished 24th in a field of 51 competitors in the individual jumping event. From 1953 through 1955 he was stationed in Germany, from where he continued to compete internationally, most notably at the 1955 Show Jumping World Championships. He trained to compete at the 1956 Summer Olympics, but military duties and a broken hoof bone in his horse prevented him from attending. He retired from active competition soon thereafter.\nLater life.\nIn 1956 Russell returned to the United States where he was assigned to run the United States Modern Pentathlon Training Center at Fort Sam Houston. Over the next several decades, he coached six United States Olympic modern pentathlon delegations, twenty-two World Championship teams, and helped organize the 1959 and 1977 World Modern Pentathlon Championships. In retirement he has operated the Russell Equestrian Center and worked as a judge at national horse shows. In 2000 he was awarded the Pegasus Medal of Honor from the American Horse Shows Association (now part of the United States Equestrian Federation), which was followed up in 2001 by his induction into the United States Show Jumping Hall of Fame. He received the Gold Medal of Honor from the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne and, in February 2012, he was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame. He turned 100 in February 2020 and died in September."

        "title": "Cycling at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's sprint",
        "text": "The men's cycling sprint at the 2012 Olympic Games in London took place at the London Velopark from 4 to 6 August. There were 17 competitors from 17 nations, with nations once again limited to one cyclist each (the limit had fluctuated between one and two since 1928). The event was won by Jason Kenny of Great Britain, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's sprint. Kenny was the eighth man to win multiple medals in the event. Kenny beat Grégory Baugé of France in the final. Australia's Shane Perkins took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 25th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Two of the quarterfinalists from 2008 returned: silver medalist Jason Kenny of Great Britain and eighth-place finisher Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia. The favorite was Grégory Baugé of France, the four-time world champion (2009–2012). The British team, which had both of the finalists at the 2008 Beijing Games (Kenny and champion Chris Hoy), had to choose one because of the rule change that limited nations to one cyclist; Kenny, who had taken silver in the 2011 and 2012 world championships, was selected over Hoy, who had taken bronze in those years. (Baugé's 2011 title was later stripped due to missed doping tests, retroactively elevating Kenny and Hoy to world champion and runner-up). Kenny had never beaten Baugé head-to-head.\nNo nations made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 25th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nQualification.\nThere were 18 quota places available for the men's sprint, with a maximum of one cyclist per nation. The 10 nations qualified for the team sprint event could each enter one member of the team in the individual sprint. The other eight places went to the top eight remaining nations on the 2010–12 UCI rankings not yet qualified.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a single-elimination tournament, with repechages after the first two rounds, after seeding via time trial. The time trial involved an 875-metre distance, but with only the last 200 metres timed. All other races were 750 metres (three laps of the track) with side-by-side starts, with time kept for the last 200 metres. The first two main rounds featured single head-to-head races, with winners advancing and losers competing in repechages. Repechage races were contested by up to 3 cyclists. Beginning with the quarterfinals, each match pitted two cyclists against each other in best-of-three races.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nJason Kenny set a new Olympic record of 9.713 seconds in the qualifying round.\nNotes.\nThe first round was meant to have 9 heats, with a total of 18 riders. However, due to a rider from the Netherlands withdrawing from the competition the first round had 17 riders with Jason Kenny receiving a bye and therefore automatically qualifying for the next round. Because there was 17 competitors rather than 18, Christos Volikakis, who qualified in 17th place thought that he did not qualify and the competition was switched to a 16 rider format, resulting in him leaving the competition. This was not the case, and therefore Grégory Baugé also qualified automatically. Despite qualifying automatically, both riders had to ride half a lap of the track to qualify."

        "title": "1952 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1952 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the tenth season of the circuit. The teams Battle Creek Belles, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kalamazoo Lassies, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 110-game schedule, while the Shaugnessy playoffs featured the top four teams from each half of the regular season.\nIn 1952 the league was left with six teams, as Kenosha and Peoria folded at the end of the previous season. No changes were made to the game, but attendance continued to decline. Joanne Weaver of Fort Wayne won the batting crown with a .344 average, while her older sister and teammate Betty Foss was honored with the Player of the Year Award. Foss registered the second best average (.331) and led the league in total bases (209), runs scored (81), runs batted in (74), doubles (24) and triples (17). South Bend's Jean Faut won the pitching Triple Crown, after leading the league in earned run average (0.93) and strikeouts (114), while tying with Rockford's Rose Gacioch for the most victories (20). Faut also posted the best win–loss record (.909), that would eventually become the highest in league history. Furthermore, Marilyn Jones of Battle Creek hurled the only no-hitter of the season against Rockford on July 10.\nDuring the best-of-three series, first place Fort Wayne lost to third place Rockford, two games to one, while second place South Bend swept fourth place Grand Rapids. Fort Wayne won the first game, 5–4, in a heroic 10-inning effort by Maxine Kline. But Rockford won the next contest, 4–3, with strong pitching from Rose Gacioch, who limited the powerful Daisies to a run after struggling in the first inning. In Game 3, Migdalia Pérez scattered six hits in a 6–0 shutout against Fort Wayne, while receiving offensive support from Jean Buckley, who went 4-for-4 with four RBI. In the other series, South Bend disposed of Grand Rapids in two games. Jean Faut struck out nine Chicks in a three-hit, 2–1 victory while facing Alma Ziegler in Game 1. Then, Glenna Sue Kidd defeated Earlene Risinger and Grand Rapids in Game 2, 6–1, to face Grand Rapids in the finals. South Bend clinched the title over the Peaches, 3 to 2 games. Once more Faut was brilliant in the final series, winning two games and batting an average of .300 (6-for-20) with two triples and three RBI, while leading the Blue Sox to their second championship in a row.\nAttendance continued to decline, but no figures are available. For the second consecutive year Battle Creek failed to capture a sustainable fan base. The team would be relocated and renamed Muskegon Belles for the next season."

The New Zealand national rugby league team lost to Australia 1-2 in the three match test series.\nBackground.\nFollowing the pioneering 1907-08 All Golds tour, rugby league was developing in both New Zealand and Australia. A successful 1908 New Zealand Māori rugby league tour of Australia had taken place and helped the NSWRFL establish itself in Sydney. This tour, the second by a New Zealand national side, took place during the 1909 NSWRFL season.\nSquad.\nThe team was managed by Daniel Fraser while James Barber captained the side. Albert Asher was invited to tour with the side but declined, opting to remain in Auckland and organise the upcoming Māori tour of Australia. Charlie Pearce and Daniel Gilchrist were also named but withdrew.

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of ten fencing events on the fencing at the 1996 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-third appearance of the event. The competition was held on July 21, 1996. 43 fencers from 20 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Stanislav Pozdnyakov, prevailing over silver medalist Sergey Sharikov in an all-Russia final. The medals were the first for Russia as an independent nation, separate from the Soviet Union, in the men's sabre. Damien Touya of France won the bronze medal bout, extending France's podium streak to four Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Two of the quarterfinalists from 1992 returned: gold medalist Bence Szabó of Hungary and fifth-place finisher Antonio García of Spain. Grigory Kiriyenko of Russia had won two world championships (1989 and 1991) before the 1992 Games but suffered an early exit; he had won two more world championships (1993 and 1995) since then and hoped for better success in Atlanta. His teammates, Stanislav Pozdnyakov and Sergey Sharikov, also came into the tournament among the top five seeds. Germany's Felix Becker was also a world champion (1994).\nAlgeria, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the men's sabre; Russia competed separately from the other Soviet republics for the first time since 1912. Italy made its 21st appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament vastly simplified the competition format after a horrendously complex system used in the previous Games in Barcelona. Pool play was eliminated. Double elimination was eliminated. The tournament became a simple single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. Bouts were to 15 touches. Standard sabre rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used."

        "title": "California Golden Bears women's basketball",
        "text": "The California Golden Bears women's basketball team is the women's college basketball team of the University of California, Berkeley. The program has been to the NCAA tournament a total of nine times, and won three conference championships. The current head coach is Charmin Smith, who was hired on June 21, 2019.\nThe team plays its home games at Haas Pavilion, which was built on top of the old Harmon Gymnasium using money donated in part by the owners of Levi-Strauss. The arena was originally known as Men's Gymnasium and then later Harmon Gymnasium until the late 1990s when it went through massive renovations which displaced the team for two seasons.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first intercollegiate women's basketball game was contested between intramural teams from California and Stanford in 1896, and intramural competition at California continued in following decades. However, it was not until 1973–74, following the enaction of Title IX, that California began playing officially organized women's basketball. Deborah Gebhardt served as the Golden Bears' inaugural coach.\nAfter having four coaches in its first six seasons, the program entered a period of stability in 1979 with the arrival of Gooch Foster, who led the team to eight consecutive winning seasons to begin her tenure. Under Foster, California won consecutive conference titles in 1980–81 and 1981–82, and earned one AIAW and three NCAA tournament berths. Foster retired in the spring of 1996, after 17 seasons at the helm.\nCenter Colleen Galloway (1978–81) was the program's most notable player in its early days. She stood as the California women's all-time rebounding leader and the school's all-time scoring leader (men or women) until 2019. Galloway's number 13 was retired at the end of her collegiate career in 1981, the first Cal men's or women's player and to this day the only woman in program history to be so honored.\nJoanne Boyle era (2005–2011).\nFollowing 12 consecutive losing seasons from 1993–94 to 2004–05, California began a resurgence under former Richmond head coach Joanne Boyle. Boyle's first season ended in the Golden Bears' first NCAA Tournament appearance in fourteen years.\nIn 2006–07, California snapped Stanford's 50-game Pac-10 winning streak at Maples Pavilion en route to their first 20-win season since 1992 and a second consecutive NCAA tournament berth. The Golden Bears were ranked No. 25 in the final USA Today–ESPN women's basketball poll, and Joanne Boyle and Devannei Hampton received Pac-10 Coach and Player of the Year honors, respectively.\nIn 2007–08, California tied the 1983–84 Bears for the most wins in school history (24–4). The Bears were ranked as high as 8th in the national polls and set a then-Pac-10 women's basketball attendance record, with 10,525 witnessing Cal's 60–58 loss to Stanford at Haas Pavilion. The team won their first NCAA tournament game in a quarter-century before falling in the second round to George Washington.\nThe Golden Bears continued their uphill climb in 2008–09, with a team led by seniors Ashley Walker and Devanei Hampton. After beginning the season strongly and winning the Paradise Jam tournament in Saint Thomas, California carried their momentum into conference play. They reeled off 11 straight wins to open Pac-10 play—including their first home win over rival Stanford in 20 years—before slightly faltering down the stretch and finishing with a 15–3 conference record, tied for second. Despite a heartbreaking early exit from the Pac-10 Tournament at the hands of USC, the Bears went on a successful tournament run en route to their first ever Sweet 16 appearance. They led in the opening minutes against undefeated UConn Huskies but ultimately fell to the eventual national champions.\nIn 2009–10 the Bears brought in a top 10 recruiting class to make up for the losses of Walker and Hampton. The young Bears (the starting lineup during conference play featured four freshmen along with star senior Alexis Gray-Lawson) had an up and down year, going 6–5 in non-conference play including a home loss to nearby San Jose State. After an 0–3 conference start that left them two games under .500, the Bears started to find their form, going 12–5 the rest of the way including the Pac-10 tournament. However, the second half success was not enough for an NCAA tournament bid and Cal wound up settling for the WNIT. Although Alexis Gray-Lawson had to sit out the NIT opener because of an injury suffered in the Pac-10 tournament, the Bears edged UC Davis in overtime. Gray-Lawson returned for round 2, and the Bears romped through the remaining games against Utah, Oregon, BYU, Illinois State and finally Miami (FL) in the first ever championship game held at Haas Pavilion to win the tournament. Gray-Lawson ended her career as the all-time Cal leader in three points made and games played.\nBoyle's final season in charge in Berkeley was 2010–11, which ended with a second-round loss in the WNIT to Colorado.\nLindsay Gottlieb era (2011–2019).\nFollowing Boyle's departure for Virginia, California hired UC Santa Barbara's Lindsay Gottlieb to be the ninth coach in Golden Bears history. Keeping up where Boyle's teams left off, the 2011–12 Golden Bears returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in three years, losing in the second round to eventual runners-up Notre Dame.\nThe 2012–2013 season started with high expectations, with almost the entire team returning from the season before, including star guard Layshia Clarendon. The Golden Bears were ranked #13 in the AP pre-season poll, their highest ranking since 2009. The team lived up to the expectations, finishing the regular season 28–2 and being ranked as high as No. 5. California's 17–1 Pac-12 record earned them their first share of a regular-season conference title since 1982. Despite a semifinal exit in the Pac-12 Tournament, the Golden Bears earned a second seed in the NCAA tournament. Following an overtime win over Georgia in the Elite Eight, California advanced to their first ever Final Four, where they lost to Louisville. The following summer, Layshia Clarendon was drafted ninth overall in the 2013 WNBA draft by the Indiana Fever.\nGottlieb continued to coach the Golden Bears through the 2018–19 season, leading players including top-10 WNBA picks Clarendon, Brittany Boyd, and Kristine Anigwe to a total of seven NCAA tournament appearances, the most of any head coach in program history. Under Gottlieb, Kristine Anigwe supplanted Colleen Galloway as California's all-time rebounding and scoring leader.\nOn June 12, 2019, Gottlieb was hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as an assistant coach, becoming the first NCAA women's basketball coach to be hired by an NBA team. Gottlieb's 179 wins rank second all-time in team history.\nCharmin Smith era (2019–present).\nGottlieb was succeeded as head coach by Charmin Smith, who had been on staff at California since 2007 and had served as Gottlieb's associate head coach since 2012.\nSeason-by-season results.\n \n \n \nSource: 2011-12 Golden Bears Record Book and California Season Statistics\nPostseason results.\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Golden Bears made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 1–1.

A right-hander, Lambert stood tall and weighed . He was born in Summit, Illinois, and attended Illinois College.\nLambert entered pro baseball in the Cincinnati farm system as a 22-year-old in . In , hurling for the Ogden Reds of the Class C Pioneer League, he posted a 21–6 won–lost record, and led his circuit in earned run average (2.21) and winning percentage (.778). The following year, he was promoted to top-level Syracuse of the International League, and pitched well, winning seven of ten decisions and lowering his ERA to 1.91. Lambert then missed three seasons, 1943–1945, serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.\nReturning to baseball in its first postwar season, he spent 1946 on the Reds' National League roster, appearing in 23 games, 19 of them in relief. Pitching for a second-division club, his year was marked by two highlights, both starting assignments: complete game victories against the Chicago Cubs on August 31 and Philadelphia Phillies on September 19.\nLambert began 1947 on the Reds' early-season roster, but in his first appearance of the year on April 18 against the Pittsburgh Pirates in relief, he was treated harshly, surrendering six hits and seven earned runs in only one inning of work. The Reds lost the contest, 12–11. Lambert worked in two more games, the last on April 28, but when Cincinnati optioned him back to Syracuse at the May cutdown, Lambert retired from the game rather than report.\nHe returned to Ogden, Utah, site of his 1940 and 1941 seasons, where he appeared in ten games at age 31 before retiring from baseball. He settled in Ogden, where he died at 64 in April 1991."

        "title": "2011–12 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2011–12 Michigan Tech Huskies men's ice hockey team represents Michigan Technological University in the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team is coached by Mel Pearson, a 1981 Michigan Tech alumnus in his first season as a head coach after spending the past 23 seasons as an assistant/associate coach for the Michigan Wolverines. The Huskies play their home games at the MacInnes Student Ice Arena on the campus of Michigan Tech in Houghton, Michigan, and compete in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).\nMichigan Tech enters the 2011–12 season after winning 4 of their 38 games the previous season. The team's 4–30–4 record led to the resignation of head coach Jamie Russell shortly after the season's completion. Mel Pearson was hired as Russell's replacement in May.\nOffseason coaching change.\nJamie Russell, Michigan Tech's eighth-year head coach, resigned following the 2010–11 season, in which the Huskies won 4 games and endured a 26‑game winless streak. \"The best memories are of the players and the guys I've worked with, that's what I'll remember\", Russell said. \"Successes, obviously, there weren't enough of them.\" Russell accepted an assistant coaching position with Providence a few months later. Michigan Tech athletic director Suzanne Sanregret began searching for Russell's replacement immediately after his resignation, saying university president Glenn Mroz gave her the authority and many alumni gave her the resources to \"go after the best coach\". Among Sanregret's interviewees were Michigan Tech alumnus and Michigan associate coach Mel Pearson, Nebraska–Omaha associate coach Mike Hastings and Green Bay (USHL) head coach Eric Rud. Pearson's interview took place four days after his team lost the NCAA Division I national championship game to Minnesota–Duluth, and when Sanregret gave him 48 hours to decide whether to accept the position, he ultimately could not say yes. \"[W]ith everything going on, it was just a tough time to make ... a life-changing decision\", Pearson said. \"So I just think I went with the safe way and said no\".\nSanregret continued the search after Pearson turned down the job, but she met with Pearson again in early May at the American Hockey Coaches Association convention in Naples, Florida, and this time he was ready to accept. Pearson signed a five-year contract and was introduced at the Grant Hockey Educational Center on Michigan Tech's campus on May 10. At the press conference, Pearson posited that what separates him from the previous alumni who have returned to coach the Huskies is his 30 years of experience. \"As you're in the game longer you get a bigger network of people who can help you recruit, so I think that's the biggest difference right now\", Pearson said. Bill Muckalt, a veteran of five National Hockey League (NHL) seasons who was coached by Pearson at Michigan, was hired as an assistant coach in June; Damon Whitten was retained as the other assistant coach. \"Our coaching staff has done a lot of winning and we want to instill the attitude that we're going to win\", Whitten said. Pearson spoke of changing the team's style of play to emphasize skill, speed and offensive creativity, and said his staff's efforts would be focused on recruiting for the next few months. He brought in Steve Shields, another former NHL player who played under Pearson at Michigan, as a volunteer goaltending coach in September.\nRecruiting.\nMost of Michigan Tech's incoming freshmen for the 2011–12 season had been recruited and verbally committed during Jamie Russell's tenure. The first was forward Tanner Kero, whose hometown of Hancock, Michigan, is across Portage Lake from Michigan Tech. Kero committed in late 2009 while a member of the Marquette Rangers of the North American Hockey League (NAHL). He spent the 2010–11 season with the Fargo Force of the United States Hockey League (USHL) and was named to the USHL Western Conference All-Star Team while scoring 37 points in 55 games. Defenseman Nick Cecere committed to play at Nebraska–Omaha while a member of Northwood School's \"Junior Team\", but switched to Michigan Tech after a coaching change at Nebraska–Omaha. Explaining why he chose Michigan Tech, Cecere said, \"Since I've been in prep school, I'm used to a smaller, close-knit community, and that's what I like. ... I fell in love with [Michigan Tech], and my parents did as well\". Indiana Ice (USHL) forward David Johnstone, brother of Michigan Tech sophomore forward Jacob Johnstone, committed two months later. Justin Fillion, who was in his third season with the Prince George Spruce Kings of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), also committed in December. He credited his coach, former Michigan Tech player Ed Dempsey, with helping him earn the scholarship that Tech offered. Blake Pietila, a forward with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, originally committed to Northern Michigan, but switched when his older brother Chad decided to transfer from Northern Michigan to Michigan Tech. Blake was drafted by the New Jersey Devils with the 129th pick of the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, becoming Michigan Tech's first drafted player since Jordan Foote was selected in 2004.\nTwo recruits decommitted after Russell's resignation. Sam Labrecque, a defenseman with the Nanaimo Clippers (BCHL), had committed to Michigan Tech in October 2010, but switched to Clarkson. Andrew Kolb, a forward with the Michigan Warriors (NAHL), instead joined Division III Wisconsin–Stevens Point.\nThe new coaching staff spent much of the summer recruiting for 2011–12 and beyond. Pearson spotted defenseman Jimmy Davis at a June tryout camp for the Muskegon Lumberjacks, a USHL team for which Davis was trying to earn a roster spot after two all-state seasons with East Kentwood High School, and Davis accepted his scholarship offer. Michigan Tech's recruiting of defenseman Riley Sweeney, who played for the Surrey Eagles (BCHL), began during the Jamie Russell era, and he ultimately committed after speaking with Bill Muckalt at a hockey camp in July. The final addition of Sweeney meant eight players joined the team for the 2011–12 season. Six of those players were available at the start of the season; until the end of the fall semester, however, Chad Pietila was not eligible to play in any games and Fillion was not eligible to join the team.\nSeason events.\nPreseason.\nThe NCAA ice hockey season began on September 15, and head coach Mel Pearson held a practice that day with assistance from goaltending coach Steve Shields while the other assistant coaches were on recruiting trips. Practices continued four days a week, though the coaches were only allowed on the ice two hours a week through September. The results of a WCHA preseason poll were released in late September, and while Pearson finished second place in voting for coach of the year, the team was picked to finish in last place in the standings. Senior captain Brett Olson said, \"We're definitely not a last place team... With everything that's been set in place, attitude and everything, we're definitely going to be contending\". Heading into an October 1 exhibition game at home against the Lakehead Thunderwolves, Pearson planned to use at least two goaltenders and prepared his team to play the \"up-tempo, aggressive, puck control style that has been the focus of practices so far\". The intent was that aggressive backchecking and outnumbering opposition forwards would lead to more turnovers and therefore more offensive chances. The Huskies won the game against Lakehead 5–3 after coming back from 1–2 and 2–3 deficits. Sophomore forward Jacob Johnstone scored a hat trick, and senior goaltender Josh Robinson played the entire game after Shields recommended leaving him in to see how he responded to playing from behind. Pearson cut defenseman Ricky Doriott and forwards Alan L'Esperance and Evan Witt from the roster the following Monday.\nRegular season.\nOctober.\nThe regular season opened on October 7 with a two-game series against visiting American International. Pearson sought to improve the team's defensive zone coverage in practices before the series, but starting goaltender Kevin Genoe gave up three goals in the first period while his Yellow Jackets counterpart, Ben Meisner, stopped all eight Huskies shots. The Huskies' comeback began late in the second period when Blake Pietila's pass deflected off a defender's skate past Meisner. In the third period, goals from Pietila, Steven Seigo and Jordan Baker completed Michigan Tech's 5–3 comeback win. Genoe stopped all 14 shots he faced in the final two periods. In the following night's rematch, Robinson started at goaltender and the Huskies scored first after Riley Sweeney's pass sent Brett Olson on a shorthanded breakaway and Meisner failed to stop Olson's high shot. The Yellow Jackets, however, tied the game 31 seconds later while the Huskies were still shorthanded. Pearson had inserted Mikael Lickteig in the lineup for this game, hoping his speed would be beneficial, and it paid off when Lickteig created a scoring chance for himself that Meisner stopped, but Jacob Johnstone scored on the rebound. In the second period, Johnstone found a loose puck immediately in front of Meisner and made \"three quick stick-handling moves for a highlight-reel goal\", and the Huskies won 3–1. Robinson stopped 32 of 33 shots, and Pearson called him \"the difference in the game\". The series sweep was the Huskies' first since December 19–20, 2008, against Northern Michigan. Pietila was named Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) Rookie of the Week for his two-goal performance in the series' first game.\nMichigan Tech hosted Wisconsin for a two-game series the following weekend to open its WCHA conference schedule, but did so without junior defenseman Tommy Brown, who underwent an appendectomy that week. Pearson wanted his team to play with more discipline so as to limit the Badgers' power play chances, and the Huskies responded by taking one penalty through the first two periods of the Friday game. Michigan Tech freshman Tanner Kero opened the scoring in the second period with his first career goal by deflecting a shot from Riley Sweeney. In the third period, however, the Huskies incurred two consecutive penalties in the first seven minutes, and Wisconsin forward Tyler Barnes beat Josh Robinson for a power play goal. The Huskies outshot the Badgers 16–8 in the third period, but could not put the puck past Landon Peterson to win the game in regulation. Nearly three minutes into the overtime period, Michigan Tech started a dump-and-chase and Peterson stopped the puck behind his net, but he collided with teammate John Ramage while the Huskies forechecked, leaving Jordan Baker to score on an undefended goal and win the game. In the Saturday game, Wisconsin started Joel Rumpel at goaltender and Huskies forwards Kero and Blake Pietila each scored a power play goal on a deflection. Midway through the second period, Wisconsin scored off a rebound after Robinson stopped the initial shot. Michigan Tech killed off a five-minute major penalty to Alex MacLeod in the third period, but the Badgers tied the game with two minutes remaining. Twenty seconds into overtime, however, Huskies captain Brett Olson scored on a wrap-around shot that went through Rumpel's five-hole for the win. Pearson was pleased with his team's performance, saying, \"Our kids are working hard, there's a lot of good things going on in our locker room and we see it every day as coaches\". Robinson was named WCHA Defensive Player of the Week after stopping 44 of 47 shots in the series.\nThe Huskies traveled to Bemidji State for a pair of games on October 21–22 and anticipated employing \"better puck control and discipline, while maintaining a fast-paced, aggressive style that better capitalizes on offensive opportunities and limits opposing scoring chances\". Josh Robinson started on Friday and surrendered an early goal to Beavers captain Ben Kinne, but Michigan Tech responded with goals from Carl Nielsen, David Johnstone and Blake Pietila in a seven-minute span. After Bemidji State replaced starting goaltender Dan Bakala with Andrew Walsh, the Beavers scored three more goals to end the first period with a 4–3 lead. Bemidji State added two more goals by the midway point of the third period, but Alex MacLeod scored off a rebound and Steven Seigo scored on a shot \"through traffic\" to reduce the lead to one goal. Pearson substituted an extra skater for Robinson late in the game, but the Huskies were unable to score on either of the scoring opportunities they generated and lost the game 6–5. Kevin Genoe started at goaltender for Michigan Tech in the Saturday game. MacLeod opened the scoring in the first period on one of the Huskies' 12 shots. Michigan Tech took five penalties in the second period, and the Beavers converted on two of the power play opportunities. Drew Fisher scored Bemidji State's third goal of the game 12 minutes into the third period, and Walsh stopped the rest of Michigan Tech's shots to earn the victory. The Huskies outshot the Beavers 32–16.\nThe #2-ranked Denver Pioneers, a team Pearson said \"[has] more balance and ... experience than the three teams we've seen so far\", visited Michigan Tech the last weekend of October. The teams traded goals in the opening minutes of the Friday game, then Huskies forwards Milos Gordic, who played in his first two games of the year after recovering from shoulder surgery, and Ryan Furne scored 16 seconds apart midway through the first period. Furne collided with and injured Denver goaltender Adam Murray after scoring, forcing coach George Gwozdecky to substitute Juho Olkinuora. In the second period, Gordic scored a power play goal and Josh Robinson stopped all 21 Pioneers shots. Gwozdecky pulled Olkinuora with seven minutes left in the game, and Gordic completed his hat trick on an empty net a minute later. The Denver goal remained undefended for a few more minutes – \"to try to work on our six-on-five situations\", Gwozdecky said – and Brett Olson and Dennis Rix scored on the empty net. Denver added a late goal for a 7–2 final score. Robinson stopped 38 of 40 shots. The next evening, Gordic and Denver forward Jason Zucker traded goals in an \"open, fast-paced first period [that] gave way to a choppy, penalty-filled second period\". The Pioneers took the lead on a second-period power play, then Olson beat Olkinuora off a rebound in the third period. The game went to overtime, but Tanner Kero was unable to convert either of two scoring opportunities late in the five-minute period. Michigan Tech earned three of four possible points with the win and tie, and Gordic and Robinson were named WCHA Offensive and Defensive Player of the Week, respectively. Pearson said after the series, \"If we [continue to] play like that we're going to win a lot of hockey games.\"\nNovember.\nThe Huskies, with a 5–2–1 record to this point, entered their November 4–5 home series against Minnesota State ranked #16 in the USCHO.com poll. It was the first time the team had been nationally ranked in four years. The first game turned into a \"battle [between] two hot goaltenders\", and the only goal occurred on a Michigan Tech power play when Ryan Furne's 90‑foot shot toward Mavericks goaltender Austin Lee \"took a strange hop just outside the crease\" and crossed the goal line. Minnesota State failed to score on six power play opportunities and Josh Robinson stopped all 29 shots. In the second game, Huskies goals from Jacob Johnstone, Blake Pietila and Tanner Kero were matched by Minnesota State, and the game was tied 3–3 after two periods. The Mavericks took advantage of Michigan Tech's penalties and sloppy defensive play in the third period and scored two more goals against Josh Robinson, plus an empty-net goal, to win the game 6–3. \"It's tough to lose at home like that, but we're going into an off week, and we have a lot of time to fix things we need to get better at\", said Brett Olson.\nAfter an off-week, Michigan Tech traveled to Alaska–Anchorage for games on November 18 and 19. Junior defenseman Carl Nielsen stayed home to recover from a concussion sustained in the team's previous game, and with three freshmen defensemen in the lineup, Pearson stressed defensive zone coverage in practice sessions before the series. Kevin Genoe started at goaltender in the Friday game and gave up one goal in each period. Sophomore defenseman Bradley Stebner scored his first collegiate goal, and the Huskies' only goal of the game, on a 4-on-3 attack late in the second period. Five or six of the 19  shots generated by Michigan Tech were \"quality chances\" according to Alaska–Anchorage coach Dave Shyiak, and Seawolves defenseman Corbin Karl said it was \"the most complete game\" his team had played to that point in the season. In the Saturday game, Josh Robinson started at goaltender and earned his second shutout of the season while stopping 23 shots. On the offensive side, the Huskies capitalized on numerous defensive mistakes by the Seawolves. Blake Pietila scored after Michigan Tech forced a turnover inside the Alaska–Anchorage zone. Jordan Baker was left undefended and scored on a rebound. Ryan Furne was similarly left alone in front of the goal before he scored. Milos Gordic and Jacob Johnstone also scored for the Huskies in their 5–0 win.\nAwards and honors.\nWCHA Offensive Player of the Week\nWCHA Defensive Player of the Week\nWCHA Rookie of the Week"

The prize pool was £13,000 in 2011 and has become the largest Scrabble tournament in Europe.  Players from as far away as Australia, Nigeria, and the United States have participated.\nThe event consists of an 18-game warm-up event running over two days followed by a separate 30-game main event running over 3-days. The former awards a smaller pool of prize money than the latter. Players may enter one of both of these, but the official title of UK Open Champion is awarded to the winner of the main event.  The tournament has revolutionized Scrabble in the UK.\nFounder and organiser Len Moir said:\n \"There are people from around the globe. It’s one week, a great prize fund and 48 games –  Coventry was chosen because it’s the centre of England and it has great air links.

        "text": "The 2012 World Series of Poker was the 43rd annual World Series of Poker (WSOP). It was held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, between May 27 and July 16, 2012, with the final table of the Main Event delayed until late October.\nThere were 61 bracelet events, culminating in the $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event beginning on July 7. From 2008 through 2011, Main Event final tables were delayed until November. However, due to the 2012 U.S. presidential election, this year's final table was delayed until October 29, with heads-up play commencing the following day.\nNew tournament formats introduced in the 2012 WSOP included a re-entry tournament, an ante only tournament, a mixed max tournament (in which the number of players per table changes at set times during the tournament), and a four-handed tournament.\nEvent 55: The Big One for One Drop.\nThe 2012 WSOP also hosted an event with the largest buy-in in poker history, a $1 million tournament benefiting the One Drop Foundation. The WSOP waived its normal 10% rake of the entry fees, and 11.1% of each buy-in (precisely $111,111) went to the foundation. All 48 seats available for the event were filled, resulting in a first prize of $18.3 million, breaking the record of $12 million won by Jamie Gold at the 2006 WSOP. One Drop initially received US$5.44 million, including a 49th/personal $111,111 donation from Caesars Interactive Entertainment CEO Mitch Garber, who was ineligible to play because of his role with the company. Guy Laliberté, the founder of the One Drop Foundation, finished in fifth place; he donated his entire winnings of US$1,834,666 to the foundation, for a total donation of US$7.28 million from this single tournament game.\nMain Event.\nThe $10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event began on July 7. In a change from previous years, which featured four starting days, there were only three starting days at this year's event. The players from days 1A and 1B then played on days 2A and 2B, which were held the same day in separate rooms, while the players from Day 1C played on Day 2C. After reaching the final table of nine players on July 16, the remainder of the tournament was delayed until October 29.\nThe Main Event attracted 6,598 entrants, creating a prize pool of $62,021,200. The top 666 finishers placed in the money, with the top nine players guaranteed at least $754,798. The winner earned $8,531,853.\nTwo women almost made the final table. Norwegian Elisabeth Hille finished at 11th place while Gaelle Baumann finished in tenth place. Her finish marked the best performance by a woman at the Main Event since Barbara Enright finished fifth in 1995 (Annie Duke finished tenth in 2000, but the total number of tournament entrants was lower).\nOther notable high finishes.\n\"NB: This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry.\"\nCoverage.\nTelevised coverage of the 2012 World Series of Poker could be found on ESPN. On Tuesday nights from July 3 through October 30, episodes of the WSOP would air on ESPN, with two one-hour episodes airing each week. The prior year, the WSOP Main Event was aired with near-live coverage on a brief delay, but that near-live coverage was done away with for the 2012 WSOP. In addition to the 2012 WSOP Main Event coverage on ESPN, the $1 million buy-in Big One for One Drop aired on a 15-minute delay on ESPN and ESPN3 on July 3 during a five-hour time slot. On July 31, an edited two-hour show of the Big One for One Drop aired. On August 7, the WSOP National Championship was on offer, then coverage of the WSOP Main Event started on August 14. The 2012 WSOP bracelet event broadcasts are archived in the on-demand section of PokerGO.com.\nThe final table of the 2012 WSOP Main Event aired on a 15-minute delay on Monday, October 29, on ESPN2 and ESPN3 and on Tuesday, October 30, on ESPN and ESPN3. Lon McEachern, Norman Chad, Antonio Esfandiari, and Kara Scott were the on-air talent and the event was produced by Poker PROductions, headed by Mori Eskandani.

        "text": "The 2012 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the men's singles tournament at the 2012 Australian Open between Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, at the time ranked the number 1 and 2 players in the world, respectively. A defining match in the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry, the Serb defeated the Spaniard 5–7, 6–4, 6–2, 6–7(5–7), 7–5 to win the tournament. It was the longest major final match (by duration) in history, lasting 5 hours 53 minutes, overtaking the record previously set by the 1988 US Open final between Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl. It is considered to be one of the greatest tennis matches of all time. With both players operating at their highest levels, the match was regarded as a war of attrition with impeccable quality throughout the duration of play. Before this match, Djokovic played an epic semifinal match against Andy Murray, which also went to five sets, lasting 4 hours and 50 minutes. The match remains the only time that Nadal has lost a major final after winning the first set.\nBackground.\nHeading into the match, Djokovic and Nadal were the top two players in the world, with Djokovic coming off of his breakthrough 2011 season, considered one of the greatest seasons ever. Djokovic went 6–0 in matches against Nadal in the 2011 season, all in finals in Big Title events. Djokovic was a two-time titlist at the Australian Open, in 2008 and 2011, and therefore was the defending champion, while Nadal had previously won the Australian Open in 2009. Djokovic won his first three matches in straight sets, dropping only one set in the fourth round to Lleyton Hewitt. Later, Djokovic beat No. 5 David Ferrer in the quarterfinals in straight sets, No. 4 and Australian Open runner-up of the previous two years, Andy Murray, in a marathon match in the semifinals, which went to five sets and lasted almost five hours, and which was described as the match of the tournament at its end. Heading into the match, Nadal had won his first four matches in straight-sets, including over Feliciano López in the fourth round who was No. 19 in the world. In the quarterfinals, he beat a peaking Tomáš Berdych in four sets, who was No. 7 in the world, in a match lasting over four hours, and then defeated former four-time Australian Open titlist Roger Federer in the semifinals in four sets, who was No. 3 in the world and riding a 24-match winning streak coming into the match, in a match lasting just under four hours, with both matches being described as high-quality affairs.\nHeading into the final, Nadal was attempting to avoid becoming the first man to lose three consecutive major finals in the Open Era, while Djokovic was aiming to become the fifth man after Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Federer and Nadal to win three majors in a row.\nMatch.\nNadal won the first set 7–5, gaining a break of serve after a long attritional battle. The second set was equally close, with Djokovic breaking first, losing the advantage, and breaking back to win the set 6–4 and level the match at one set each. The third set was the shortest of the match, as Djokovic broke Nadal twice to take the set 6–2. Nevertheless it was a grueling set that ran 45 minutes, longer than an average set. In this set, Djokovic dropped only two points on serve and broke again in game eight with a crushing forehand to lead for the first time. \nNadal won the fourth set tiebreak, 7-5 after trailing within the set and also down during the closely contested tiebreak; Djokovic had led 5–3 before Nadal took the next four points. The final set saw a return of the intense play seen in the opening sets. Nadal broke in the sixth game to take a 4–2 lead; Djokovic then broke back to level at 4–4. Finally, Djokovic made a decisive break of serve to win what is, in terms of duration, both the longest Grand Slam final in the Open Era and also the longest match in the history of the Australian Open. The match finished at 1:37am the following morning. Due to exhaustion, both players were given chairs to sit during the trophy presentation speeches.\nLegacy.\nThis match is central to the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry. Nadal called it the toughest loss of his career, but the best match he ever played. Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played. Not only was this the longest Grand Slam final, but according to Tennis Channel and the Australian Open TV networks, this was one of the most-watched finals, despite ending late into the night locally. It was the first and only Grand Slam final that Nadal has lost after winning the first set. At the time, it was Nadal's second loss in a Grand Slam match after winning the first set, with his then record slipping to 133–2. Nadal became the first man to lose three consecutive Grand Slam finals in the Open Era, all to Djokovic. Djokovic became the fifth man to win three Grand Slams in a row. It also remains the longest match of both Nadal and Djokovic's careers.\nIn 2015, Nadal chose the final as his favorite memory at the Australian Open over his win in 2009. In 2022, Casper Ruud, a fan of Nadal, stated that if there was one match in the history of tennis he could change, it would be the final in favor of Nadal. In 2023, it was listed by \"Tennis.com\" as one of the key matches in the \"GOAT race\" for most Grand Slam titles between the Big Three.\nStatistics.\nSource\nDjokovic and Nadal about the match.\nAfter the match, Nadal said that \"His [Djokovic's] return probably is one of the best in history\" and \"[He makes it] almost every time\". \"This one was very special,\" Nadal said. \"But I really understand that was a really special match, and probably a match that's going to be in my mind not because I lost, no, because the way that we played.\" Nadal also stated that \"Physically it was the toughest match I ever played, if not tougher. I am tired\".\nDjokovic said, \"It was obvious on the court for everybody who has watched the match that both of us, physically, we took the last drop of energy that we had from our bodies, we made history tonight and unfortunately there couldn't be two winners\". In 2020, Djokovic reiterated that the match was the most grueling and physically exhausting match he ever played."

        "title": "1908 New Zealand Māori rugby league tour of Australia",
        "text": "The 1908 New Zealand Māori rugby league tour of Australia was a tour made by a group of New Zealand Māori rugby footballers who played rugby league matches in Queensland and New South Wales. The tour had a large role in helping the New South Wales Rugby League establish itself in Sydney. As a result, the tour is a significant part of rugby league history. Financial and legal issues disrupted the end of the tour and an exhibition match held under rugby union rules was held to help pay for the team's return voyage to New Zealand.\nBackground.\nRugby league was founded in 1895 when rugby union clubs in Northern England split from the governing body over the ability to pay their players and formed the Northern Union. Similar tensions developed in Australasia and they came to a head when the 1905 Original All Blacks toured Great Britain. This tour made the New Zealand Rugby Union a huge profit of £12,000, yet the players were only paid 3/- a day expenses while on tour.\nThis resulted in the 1907-08 New Zealand tour of Great Britain to play the Northern union clubs. At the same time in Sydney the New South Wales Rugby League was forming, resulting in the 1908 NSWRFL season.\nAlbert Asher, an All Black who was injured and could not tour with the 1907-08 New Zealand side, began organising with the NSWRL to host a tour of a New Zealand Māori side, perhaps inspired by the successful 1888–1889 New Zealand Native football team that toured Britain and Australia. Many Māori were reportedly unhappy by their treatment from the Wellington-based NZRU.\nSwitch of codes.\nNew Zealand newspapers at the time reported that the tour was traveling to Sydney to play the fifteen man code. These reports would have allayed concern from the New Zealand Rugby Union about another break-away tour being organised.\nStories published after the teams arrival in Sydney stated that they had been surprised to be met by members of the New South Wales Rugby League instead of the New South Wales Rugby Union yet, after a brief meeting, voted to change codes. This story was later retold by the party members, including by Ernie Asher in a 1960 Auckland Star interview.\nHowever, Albert Asher knew the distinction between the two codes and had been negotiating with the NSWRL for months. Sydney newspapers had also published itineraries and stories about the Māori side that was to play the professional clubs.\nThe tour.\nThe touring party arrived in Sydney in June and watched the final match of the 1907-08 All Golds on 6 June before the All Golds returned to New Zealand. The Māori side watched a round of the NSWRL Premiership and were advised by referee George Boss as they learned the rules.\nTwo days later, on Monday 8 June 1908, the first match of the tour took place against New South Wales and was held as a benefit match to raise funds for the family of Albert Baskiville. New South Wales led 7-3 at halftime and won the match 18-9. The first team for the Māori was Riki Papakura, Hone Tuki, Albert Asher (c), Hauauru Pakere, Te Keepa Pouwhiuwhiu, Niko Ratete, Hone Whiteriana, Hone Pihama, Punga Pakere, TJ Iharairawa, Haukore Ririnui, Henare Rota and Hokopa Hatana. The NSWRL reported that £1,058 was taken at the gate, followed by another £176 at a music concert held in the Town Hall that evening.\nNew South Wales also won the second fixture, 30-16 in front of 20,000 fans. Dally Messenger scored 18 of the points himself for New South Wales. The Māori then recorded their first win of the tour, defeating Sydney Metropolitan in a mid-week match. During the match the NSWRL secretary, James Giltinan, left the ground to argue with the referee - creating the first tension between Giltinan and Asher.\nThe team then traveled north to Newcastle but not before Giltinan and Asher could clash over the appointment of the touring referee. The team defeated Newcastle 15-2 before heading to Queensland. Due to the dispute over the referee Giltinan made the party pay for the referees expenses. Following the development of legal issues, ten of the touring party were left behind in Sydney when they headed to Queensland. However Giltinan overrode this decision and later sent them to Queensland, at the touring party's expense.\nIn Queensland, the Māori won the first match against Queensland 19-16 after leading 16-10 at halftime. They also won the midweek match 13-5. Queensland won the third match 6-5 after a late try to William Hardcastle, a former All Black who now resided in Queensland. The teams then headed to country towns for a series of exhibition matches.\nThe first exhibition match at the Toowoomba Agricultural Society Ground ended in controversy when the whole Māori team left the field following the sending off of Hauauru Pakere by referee Micky Dore, who had played for Queensland in Brisbane. The sending off resulted in a brawl that involved spectators and Albert Asher led his team off the field as he feared for his players safety. The second exhibition was played in Warwick and Queensland won 23-14.\nOn their return to Sydney they played a match against Newcastle, winning 30-16.\nOnce back in Sydney the Māori played a match against a full Australian side, losing 10-20. They then won a match against Sydney Metropolitan at Birchgrove Park. Sydney included Dally Messenger however Sydney lost 13-34.\nSimmering tensions between Giltian and Asher then exploded, resulting in the cancellation of the rest of the tour. Matches against Australia and New South Wales had been planned, as well as potentially a third match against Australia in Melbourne. Initial media reports said the second match against Australia was delayed due to rain, however Asher had accused Giltian of being untruthful about gatetakings for the matches and deducting ground hire fees, despite having a lease over the Sydney Agricultural Ground.\nWith the official tour ended and gate takings being held by the NSWRL due to a court order, the Māori needed to find a way to pay for their return voyage. A match under rugby union rules was held at the Sports Ground between the \"New Zealand Natives\" and a \"Metropolis\" side made up of players sympathetic to the touring parties plight. The match was a mis-match and the Natives won 32-17.\nThe team was on the dock to wish the Australian side well on their 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. As soon as the team departed, acting NSWRL secretary Horrie Miller paid for the fares home to New Zealand and the Māori side returned home.\nLegal troubles.\nRobert Jack, who was based in Sydney, claimed he had been arranging with Asher to bring a tour to Sydney since October 1907. Following a breakdown in negotiations Asher began negotiating directly with the NSWRL. After their first Sydney leg, Jack took the matter to court where he was successful in having the NSWRL gate takings frozen until the dispute could be resolved. This left the touring party deeply out of pocket and a reduced party was sent on the Queensland leg to save costs.\nThe matter was left unresolved and was again raised in the courts when the 1909 side visited Australia.\nAftermath.\nEight of the players on the tour went on to have notable rugby league careers, with four later representing New Zealand and two playing in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership.\nAnother Māori tour was organised and the team visited Australia during the 1909 season. These two tours are credited with helping financially establishing the New South Wales Rugby League, as at the time it was surviving “from hand to mouth”.\nMāori players played a big role in the City Rovers and Manukau clubs and a Rotorua sub-league was formed linked to the Auckland Rugby League during the 1909 season.\nSquad.\nFour chiefs accompanied the touring party."

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners, San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, Miami Marlins, Minnesota Twins and Atlanta Braves. Vincent was drafted by the Padres in the 18th round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft, and made his major league debut in 2012.\nHigh school and college.\nVincent was born in Poway, California, to Randy and Jill Vincent. He attended Ramona High School (Class of 2004) in Ramona, California, a town in the foothills northeast of San Diego. In 2004 he was 6-6 with a 2.73 ERA, and was named Valley League Pitcher of the Year.\nHe played college baseball at Palomar College, a junior college, and California State University, Long Beach, where he majored in criminal justice.

        "text": "Alan Phillips (born 17 June 1956) is a South African retired badminton and baseball player. He won the national badminton championship 27 times, more than any other player. Phillips also played for the South African national baseball team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. As of October 2012, Phillips serves as a baseball coach.\nCareer.\nPhillips won 27 national titles in badminton, competing in the South African Badminton Championships, the most of any player. He qualified for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona as the nation's second-ranked badminton player. However, the South African sports federation bypassed Phillips for the third-ranked player because they felt Phillips was too old. He represented South Africa in badminton in the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia.\nThough South Africa does not have a professional baseball league, Phillips played baseball for various local amateur teams as a relief pitcher, including the Clyde Pinelands and Bellville Tygers. He played for the South African national baseball team in the 1998 Baseball World Cup in Italy and in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. At 44, Phillips was the oldest baseball Olympian. Phillips coached the South African team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.\nLike many South African athletes, Phillips has a full-time job. He works as an electrical inspector.\nPersonal.\nPhillips' wife, Gussie, also plays badminton; the couple played mixed doubles in the 1994 Commonwealth Games. His sons, Anthony Phillips and Jonathan Phillips, who both played for South Africa in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, are both minor league baseball players."

He had a five-game trial in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and pinch hitter for the Cincinnati Redlegs. Coles was born in Fredericktown, Pennsylvania, and attended Waynesburg College. He threw and batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nHis career began in the Brooklyn Dodgers' organization and was interrupted by military service in 1953–1954. Coles reached double figures in home runs in nine different minor-league seasons, exceeding 24 homers for three straight years (1956–1958). At the tail end of the last of those seasons, Coles was called up by the Redlegs from the Double-A Nashville Vols after he had smashed 29 homers, scored 117 runs, driven in 107, and batted .307 playing in offense-friendly Sulphur Dell. He led the Southern Association in runs batted in and was selected the circuit's All-Star first baseman.\nIn his five September 1958 appearances, Coles started four contests: three as left fielder and one as center fielder; he pinch hit in a fifth. He collected two hits, including a double, in 11 at bats (.182) and two runs batted in.\nColes died in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, at 64 on January 25, 1996."

        "text": "The men's épée was one of ten fencing events on the fencing at the 1996 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-second appearance of the event. The competition was held on 20 July 1996. 45 fencers from 21 nations competed, a sharply reduced number from prior Games which generally had 60 to 80 fencers. Each nation remained limited to 3 fencers in the event. The event was won by Aleksandr Beketov of Russia, the nation's first victory and first medal in the event in its debut (though it was the third straight Games with a Russian on the podium, with Andrey Shuvalov taking bronze for the Soviet Union in 1988 and Pavel Kolobkov earning silver representing the Unified Team in 1992). Iván Trevejo's silver was Cuba's first medal in the event since Ramón Fonst won the first two gold medals in 1900 and 1904. The bronze went to Géza Imre of Hungary, that nation's first medal in the men's individual épée since 1980. France's four-Games podium streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nAll eight quarterfinalists from 1992 returned: gold medalist Éric Srecki of France, silver medalist Pavel Kolobkov of the Unified Team (now representing Russia), bronze medalist Jean-Michel Henry of France, fourth-place finisher Kaido Kaaberma of Estonia, and quarterfinalists Elmar Borrmann of Germany, Iván Kovács of Hungary, Angelo Mazzoni of Italy, and Mauricio Rivas of Colombia. Kolobkov had won the World Championship in 1993 and 1994; Srecki was the reigning World Champion having won in 1995.\nBelarus, the Czech Republic, and Russia each made their debut in the event. France, Sweden, and the United States each appeared for the 20th time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament eliminated pool play, a staple of Olympic fencing since 1896. The double-elimination rounds that had been used for the past few Games were also eliminated. For the first time, the format consisted entirely of a single-elimination bracket with a bronze medal match. The 15-touch bout was introduced for the first time, with all bouts being to 15 touches. The number of fencers was also reduced."

The competition was held on 22 July 1996. 45 fencers from 19 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Alessandro Puccini of Italy, the nation's eighth victory in the men's foil (matching France for most all-time). France took the other two medals, with Lionel Plumenail earning silver and Franck Boidin winning the bronze medal match.\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the eight quarterfinalists from 1992 returned: gold medalist Philippe Omnès of France, silver medalist Serhiy Holubytskiy of the Unified Team (now competing for Ukraine), bronze medalist Elvis Gregory of Cuba, and fifth-place finisher Joachim Wendt of Austria. The three world champions since the last Games were Alexander Koch of Germany, Rolando Tucker of Cuba, and Dmitriy Shevchenko of Russia; all were competing in Atlanta.\nKazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan each made their debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 20th appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament vastly simplified the competition format after a horrendously complex system used in the previous Games in Barcelona. Pool play was eliminated. Double elimination was eliminated. The tournament became a simple single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. Bouts were to 15 touches. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used."

        "title": "Phil Emery (American football)",
        "text": "Phillip Emery (born January 16, 1959) is a former American football executive. He served as the general manager of the Chicago Bears from 2012 to 2014. He also held scouting positions for the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Falcons.\nEarly life.\nEmery was born and grew up in Michigan and attended high school at Garden City East High School (which is now Garden City High School). He attended college and earned a Teaching Degree at Wayne State University in Detroit. Emery received his Master of Arts Degree in Secondary Education from Western New Mexico University in 1983.\nNFL scout.\nEmery was an area scout for the Bears from 1998 to 2004, working first under VP of Player Personnel Mark Hatley and then Jerry Angelo while serving head coaches Dave Wannstedt, Dick Jauron and Lovie Smith. He was hired by Rich McKay as the director of scouting for the Atlanta Falcons in May 2004 and served in that role through the 2008 draft. After the 2008 Draft and with the hiring of new Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff; Emery worked as the Eastern Regional Scout the fall of 2008 and through the 2009 Draft. Emery was named director of college scouting for the Kansas City Chiefs immediately following the 2009 Draft and remained in that role through the end of the month of January 2012. Prior to the Bears job, he was a graduate assistant football coach at Central Michigan University (1981), offensive line and strength and conditioning coach at Western New Mexico University (1982–1983), defensive line and strength coach at both Georgetown College (1984–1985) and then Saginaw Valley State University (1985-1987), before being named assistant strength and conditioning coach at the University of Tennessee (1987–1991). Emery was hired as the Head Strength and Conditioning Coach and Assistant Professor at the United States Naval Academy (1991–1998).\nEmery returned to the Falcons in 2016 as a scout. On May 12, 2023, Emery announced his retirement from the NFL.\nChicago Bears.\n2012.\nIn 2012, Bears general manager Jerry Angelo was fired. During the team's search, Emery was one of the four candidates, and was one of the two finalists for the job, along with Arizona Cardinals director of pro personnel Jason Licht. After being hired, Bears chairman George McCaskey told Emery that though head coach Lovie Smith's contract ran through 2013, and that Smith would be head coach in 2012, Emery would have the ability to make a change at the position after the end of the 2012 season. Smith was eventually fired on December 31, 2012, after the Bears missed the playoffs, despite having led the team to a 10–6 record.\nIn Emery's first draft, he selected Shea McClellin, Alshon Jeffery, Brandon Hardin, Evan Rodriguez, Isaiah Frey, and Greg McCoy. Overall, critics had mixed reviews on Emery's debut draft, with the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" experts giving the draft an average \"C\" grade.\nOn December 31, the Bears front office released long-time head coach Lovie Smith, and Emery began searching for a new head coach.\n2013.\nOn January 16, the Bears announced the hiring of Montreal Alouettes head coach Marc Trestman as head coach. Trestman was widely regarded as Emery's pick due to his cerebral approach to the game and ability to improve the performance of the quarterbacks he has worked with.\nIn Emery's second draft, he selected G Kyle Long in the first round (20th overall), LB Jon Bostic (50th overall), LB Khaseem Greene (117th overall), OL Jordan Mills (163rd overall), DE Cornelius Washington (188th overall), and WR Marquess Wilson (236 overall). Reaction was mixed with ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. giving the whole of the Bears draft a C+ overall grade, stating the late round picks lacked value. However Jason Chilton rated the individual picks more highly in the later rounds. The Bears ended the season with an 8–8 record and failed to make the playoffs.\n2014.\nIn Emery's third draft he selected CB Kyle Fuller in the first round (1st round, 14th overall), DT Ego Ferguson (2nd round, 51st overall), DT Will Sutton (3rd round, 82nd overall), RB Ka'deem Carey (4th round, 117th overall), S Brock Vereen (4th round, 131st overall), QB David Fales (6th round, 183rd overall), P Pat O'Donnell (6th round, 191st overall), and OT Charles Leno, Jr. (7th round, 246th overall). The Bears traded with the Denver Broncos, swapping the Bears fifth round picks in 2014 and 2015 for the Broncos 4th and 7th picks in 2014. This ended up giving the Bears no fifth round pick, but two additional picks in both the fourth and sixth rounds. Emery also brought in undrafted free agents Jordan Lynch and James Dunbar. Bucky Brooks of NFL.com gave the Bears draft a B, and called the 4th round pick of Carey the draft's biggest steal.\nAdditionally, Elliot Harrison of NFL.com ranked the Bears offseason moves as the second best in the league based on a strong draft and the additions of free agents DE's Jared Allen, Willie Young, Lamarr Houston, Israel Idonije, and QB Jimmy Clausen.\nOn December 29, 2014, Emery was fired from the Bears after the team merited a 5–11 record, their worst since their debut year with Lovie Smith, and, once again, missed the playoffs. A significant, contributing factor to Emery's demise was his directive to extend quarterback Jay Cutler's contract in January 2014 to a lucrative seven-year deal with $126.7 million, of which $54 million was guaranteed. This negotiation has been deemed to be the worst contract in the NFL.\nThe Bears hired Ryan Pace on January 8, 2015, to replace Emery as the GM."

        "text": "The Bryant Bulldogs baseball team is the NCAA division 1 varsity intercollegiate baseball team of Bryant University, located in Smithfield, Rhode Island. The program participates a member of the America East Conference. The Bulldogs previously participated as members of the Northeast Conference. It plays at Conaty Park on the northern edge of Bryant's campus. Ryan Klosterman has been the program's head coach since the 2020 season.\nIn Division I, Bryant has appeared in two NCAA tournaments; it has won the NEC tournament twice and the NEC regular season title four times. In Division II, it appeared in five NCAA tournaments, including the 2004 College World Series; it won the Northeast-10 Tournament once and the NE-10 regular season title six times.\nTwo former Bulldogs, Keith MacWhorter and James Karinchak have gone on to play in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nDivision II.\n1969 was Bryant's first season of varsity NCAA baseball. Under head coach Bill Stein, the team went 5–14. In 1970, it improved to 11–8. For those first two seasons, Bryant competed in the College Division's Southern New England Conference (SNEC). For its first three seasons, Bryant was located in Providence; Stein coached the team in all three seasons before moving to Georgetown to become an assistant men's basketball coach under John Thompson. The school moved to its present-day Smithfield location ahead of the 1971–72 academic year.\nThe school hired Steve Thornton to replace Stein. The school did not sponsor a team in 1974 or 1976, but in the three seasons Thornton did coach (1972, 1973, and 1975), Bryant went 26–28 overall. In the middle of this stretch, in August 1973, the NCAA reorganized its divisions. Prior to then, the NCAA had competed in two divisions, a large-school University Division and a small-school College Division. Following the reorganization, the University Division became Division I, while the College Division split into Division II and Division III. UC Riverside became a Division II Independent. Bryant, which had been playing in the College Division, joined Division II.\nIn 1976, Keith MacWhorter became the program's first MLB Draft selection when the Dodgers picked him in the 15th round. He later played for the Boston Red Sox.\nFormer Providence hockey player Bob Reall coached the team from 1977 to 1978. The team went a combined 11–41. Another Providence alumnus, Michael McGuinn, was the head coach from 1979 to 1983. The program had its worst season in McGuinn's first year, going 1–22. The team suffered two 18-run losses (22–4 to New Haven and 18–0 to Eastern Connecticut) but also lost five one-run games. Its lone win came against Barrington.\nNortheast-10 Conference.\nBryant was a founding member of the Northeast-7 Conference in the 1980–81 academic year. The conference became the Northeast-8 when Saint Anselm joined the following year and the Northeast-10 (NE-10) when Saint Michael's and Quinnipiac joined for the 1987–88 academic year.\nEarl Matthewson replaced McGuinn and coached the team from 1984 and 1986. He had an overall record of 58–32–1 won the Northeast-10 Coach of the Year award in all three seasons. The 1985 team went 21–11 and lost to Stonehill in the NE-10 title game. In 1986, Bryant 22–11–1, won the NE-10, and qualified for its first NCAA tournament. It went 0–2 at the Northeast Regional, losing games to New Haven and Adelphi.\nAfter Matthewson left, Dale O'Dell coached the team from 1987 to 1990. Two players won major conference awards under him, both in 1987. Tony Garganese was named NE-10 Player of the Year, Bob Heinzemann Freshman of the Year. Heinzemann was the fourth consecutive Bulldog to win the award (Garganese won it in 1985). Garganese was also named a Division II All-American by the ABCA.\nBryant alumnus and Rhode Island assistant Jon Sjogren became the program's head coach after O'Dell. He held the position for 15 seasons (1991–2005) and had an overall 360–305–1 record.\nThe Bulldogs went 13–17 in Sjogren's first season. Outfielder Glenn Tatro became Bryant's second draftee when the Orioles picked him in the 25th round. Bryant had its first winning season under Sjogren in 1992, when the team went 21–17 and lost to Springfield in the NE-10 title game.\nIn 1997, facility problems plagued the team, which had to play 42 of its 43 games on the road. It finished the season with a 21–22 record. The Bryant Baseball Complex opened a few years later during the 2000 season.\nIn 1998, Bryant reached its second NCAA tournament after winning the NE-10's regular season title. It went 1–2 at the Northeast Regional, notching its first tournament win with a 10-inning, 7–6 defeat of UMass Lowell in the opening game. The program's first 30-win season came in 2001, and it reached its third NCAA tournament in 2002, again going 1–2 at the Northeast Regional.\nFor the 2003 season, the Northeast-10 switched from metal to wooden baseball bats. Sjogren said of the decision, \"We did it for the sake of the game, to make it cleaner and return it to the way it was meant to be played. We certainly feel it has done that.\"\nBryant's 2004 team made the program's deepest postseason run, going 40–17 and reaching the College World Series. The team used wooden bats during the regular season in accordance with NE-10 rules, then switched to metal bats for the NCAA postseason. Bryant hosted the Northeast Regional, which it won with a 3–1 record, defeating Dowling in the championship game. At the Division II World Series in Montgomery, Bryant won its opener against Rollins, then lost games to Grand Valley State and Central Missouri and was eliminated. B.J. Gagnon, who had been named the regionals MVP, was named to the All-World Series Team. Sjogren was named the 2004 ABCA Northeast Region Coach of the Year.\nAfter the 2005 season, Sjogren left to become the head coach at Rollins, where he replaced Bob Rikeman, who had left to become the head coach at Newberry. Bryant hired Assumption head coach Jamie Pinzino to replace him. In five seasons as head coach, Pinzino had a 162–122 overall record.\nBryant went 18–33 in Pinzino's first season but made back-to-back NCAA tournaments in 2007 and 2008. Both times, it lost to Franklin Pierce in the Northeast Regional finals. Pitcher Eric Loh of the 2007 team received several major awards: ABCA Division II All-American, ABCA Northeast Region Pitcher of the Year, and NE-10 Pitcher of the Year. Pinzino was named the NE-10's Coach of the Year.\nDivision I.\nBryant joined the NCAA Division I in the 2009 season. Playing as an independent, the Bulldogs went 32–22. Shortstop Pat McKenna was drafted by the Tigers following the season. The school's programs joined the Northeast Conference (NEC) for the 2009–10 academic year; the baseball program was ineligible for the postseason from 2010 to 2012 while the school completed the transition to Division I.\nIn 2010, Bryant won the NEC regular season title with a 25–7 conference record. It won three of the NEC's four major awards: Pinzino was named Coach of the Year, Kevin Brown Rookie of the Year, and Brent Almeida Pitcher of the Year. Brown was also named a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American.\nFollowing the season, Pinzino was involved in an incident that led to his resignation. At a postseason athletic department barbecue in May, Pinzino became intoxicated, got in a fight with an assistant baseball coach on Bryant's baseball field, and was confrontational with police when they arrived at the scene. Pinzino was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors (simple assault, disorderly conduct, and resisting arrest). As a result, he resigned his position as Bryant's baseball coach.\nBryant hired Steve Owens to replace him. Owens came from Le Moyne, which had left Division I for Division II the same offseason. At Le Moyne, he won four MAAC regular season titles, was named conference Coach of the Year twice, and appeared in three NCAA tournaments.\nIn Owens's second season, 2012, Bryant won another NEC regular season title, going 33-21 (24-8 NEC). The Bulldogs again won three of the conference's four major awards: Owens was Coach of the Year, Kevin McAvoy Rookie of the Year, and Peter Kelich Pitcher of the Year.\nIn 2013, Bryant set a program wins record and reached its first Division I NCAA tournament. The Bulldogs had a 40–15–1 regular season that included a 19-game winning streak from March 22 to April 16. For the third time, the team won three NEC major awards, with Owens the Coach of the Year, AJ Zarozny the Rookie of the Year, and Brown the Player of the Year. The team lost its opener in the NEC tournament to Long Island, then won four games in a row to win the tournament and the NEC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the third seed in the Manhattan Regional, Bryant defeated Arkansas in the opener before losing consecutive games. They finished the season at 45–18–1. Owens was named the ABCA Northeast Region Coach of the Year. Brown was named a Third-Team All-American by the ABCA, and five players were named First-Team All-New England. Brown, Kelich, and Joseph Michaud were drafted after the season.\nIn 2014, Bryant reached a second consecutive NCAA tournament. After a 39–14 regular season. Owens won his second conference Coach of the Year award; Craig Schlitter won Pitcher of the Year and Matt Albanese Rookie of the Year. The Bulldogs swept through the NEC tournament, defeating Wagner, Central Connecticut, and Sacred Heart to win the title. As the third seed at the Baton Rouge Regional, Bryant went 0–2, losing two one-run games. Owens was named the ABCA Northeast Region Coach of the Year for the second year in a row. After the season, a program-record four players were picked in the MLB Draft; McAvoy became Bryant's highest selection when the Red Sox selected him in the fourth round.\nVenues.\nConaty Park.\nBryant has played at Conaty Park since it was built for the 2000 season. Prior to being dedicated to alumni donor Bill Conaty on April 28, 2012, it was known as the Bryant Baseball Complex. Its capacity of 500 people consists of 200 chairback seats and berm seating beyond the outfield fence.\nIn 2004, the facility hosted the Division II Northeast Regional, which included Bryant, Saint Anselm, Dowling, and Caldwell. Bryant went 3–1 to win the double-elimination regional.\nHead coaches.\nSince its first season in 1969, Bryant has had nine head coaches. Bill Stein, who held the position from 1969 to 1971, was the program's first head coach. Jon Sjogren, who coached the team from 1991 to 2005, is both the longest-tenured (15 seasons) and winningest (360) coach.\nYearly records.\nBelow is a table of Bryant's yearly records. After playing its first season in 1969, the team was not sponsored in 1974 or 1976. It joined Division I in 2009.\nNotable alumni.\nThe following is a list of notable former Bulldogs.\nMajor League Baseball Draft.\n2010.\nOne Bulldog was selected in the 2010 MLB Draft.

The team is a member of the Western Athletic Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. The team plays its home games at Clay Gould Ballpark in Arlington, Texas. The Mavericks are coached by Clay Van Hook.\nHistory.\nThe UTA Mavericks began intercollegiate baseball in 1969 as the Athletic Department moved from the College Division to the University level, which required schools to sponsor more sports than UTA did at that time. As the only founding member of the Southland Conference to not offer the sport, UTA immediately had a conference home.\nTom Beasley became UTA's first head coach. After two losing seasons, Fred Mathews Took the helm and guided the Mavericks to their first winning season and a second-place finish in the SLC. He coached for two more seasons before a legend would guide the Mavericks for the next 26 seasons.\nButch McBroom amassed 756 wins, which is by far the most for any Maverick coach and still second all-time in the Southland. His teams won two Conference Championships, were runners-up six times and participated in two NCAA tournaments. He occasionally landed in national rankings as well. His players earned four pitcher-of the-year awards, one player of-the-year, one hitter-of-the-year and three newcomer-of-the-year while he, himself, won four coach-of-the-year honors.\nIn 1994, the Mavericks finished four games under .500, breaking a streak of 14-straight winning seasons. It marked the first of six-consecutive sub-.500 years, until he retired after the 1999 season.\nClay Gould was hired as the fourth coach in Maverick history. He played for the Mavericks in the early 1990s during their two NCAA tournament runs and was named the 1993 Southland Conference Player-of-the-Year. His first year was a rebuilding year, but in 2001, UTA won their first Southland Conference tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament.\nAgainst the Houston Cougars, Craig Martin, who retired as UTA's all-time hits leader and is still currently UTA's all-time doubles leader, hit a late-inning home run to win UTA's first NCAA tournament game. UTA's two losses were to host Rice University, which advanced to the Super Regional.\nDuring the season, Coach Gould was battling colon cancer, and he died shortly after the season ended.\nJeff Curtis succeeded Coach Gould in 2002 and in 2006, UTA won their second Southland Conference tournament.\nFormer Head coach Darin Thomas, who was an assistant coach under Clay Gould and associate head coach with Jeff Curtis, officially took the reins in 2008. In 2012, his team won the Southland Conference Tournament to advance to an NCAA regional for the fifth time in program history. In 2013, as the team played their first and last season in the Western Athletic Conference, the team was co-champions with California State University-Bakersfield. In 2017, the team won a program record 20 conference games en route to a West Division championship in the Sun Belt.\nSince 2013, the baseball team annually plays one game against a Division I opponent in Globe Life Park."

The team is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. The team plays its home games at Lee–Hines Field in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\nBackground.\nThe Jaguars have more SWAC titles than any school. They also have more national and black national titles than any SWAC school. Though Southern was forced to discontinue its baseball program during the uncertain times of the Great Depression and World War II years (specifically from 1932 to 1947), its program was largely stable in the subsequent post-war decades; only four head coaches coached Southern between 1949 and 2017.\nIn 1959 Southern, led by future National Baseball Hall of Famer Lou Brock, became the first historically black college or university (HBCU) to win the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics national championship. In 1987 Southern became the first HBCU to win a game in an NCAA Division I regional tournament by defeating #2-ranked Cal State Fullerton. In 1996 Southern became the first HBCU to win a game in an NCAA Division I play-in series by defeating Austin Peay. In 2003 and 2005, Southern won \"blackcollegebaseball.com\" black national championships; in 2019 Southern won a third black national championship, this time designated by \"blackcollegenines.com\", for its Large School Division.\nHead coaches.\nRobert Henry (\"Bob\") Lee, a graduate of LeMoyne College, served as head coach between 1949 and 1962, before moving on to become coach of the football team. He compiled a 207–51 (.802) overall record as baseball coach. In addition to coaching Brock and the 1959 team to an NAIA national title, he also led the Jaguars to the 1960 NAIA World Series and 2 official and 4 unofficial SWAC titles (for the 1949, 1950, 1955, and 1956 seasons). The Jaguars' baseball stadium is named in part for him.\nEmory Wellington Hines, a Texas College alum who had coached the football teams of Grambling State—before the famed Eddie Robinson had assumed the reigns—as well as Samuel Huston College, served as Southern's baseball coach between 1963 and 1976. He led the Jaguars to 2 NAIA Area 5 titles—World Series appearances, 4 NAIA District titles, 9 NAIA District tournaments, 1 NCAA Division II tournament, and 8 SWAC titles. He finished his career at Southern with a 373–130–1 (.741) record. His most noteworthy player may have been Danny Goodwin, the only player to have ever been drafted first overall in two Major League Baseball drafts and the first documented Southern player to win a national college baseball player of the year award (from the Sporting News, in 1975). The Jaguars' baseball stadium was later named in part for Hines.\nWhen Southern's athletic director had to step away from his service due to surgery, Hines was promoted in his place, and Hines recommended that Southern alum and assistant coach Lee Flentroy replace him as acting coach.\nSouthern alum Leroy Boyd later served as acting coach once the 1977 season began and was then promoted to permanent coach after the season—a title that he held through 1984. He led the Jaguars to 6 SWAC West titles, 2 SWAC titles, 3 NAIA District tournaments, and a 255–157–4 record, for a .618 winning percentage. His most prominent player may have been Reggie Williams.\nThe Jaguars were most recently led by head coach and Southern alumnus Roger Cador. He completed his coaching career, which spanned from 1985 to 2017, with a 913 wins, 597 losses, and 3 ties (.604), 22 SWAC West titles, 14 SWAC titles, 8 NCAA Division I tournament appearances, 3 NCAA Division I tournament play-in appearances, and 2 \"blackcollegebaseball.com\" HBCU national titles. He also holds the distinction of having coached the first HBCU player to win a Baseball America College Player of the Year Award, Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year award, Dick Howser Trophy, Golden Spikes Award, or Rotary Smith Award (Rickie Weeks Jr., in 2003). Cador struggled with health concerns during his later seasons and, due to issues with his pacemaker, the final three weeks of the 2010 season had to be coached by acting head coach Fernando Puebla—although the results of those games are officially credited to Cador (Puebla himself later had issues acquiring full U.S. citizenship and had to step down from the coaching staff shortly before the start of the 2014 season, resulting in Cador assuming additional coaching duties as the season approached). Cador later suffered from a bout of pneumonia late in the 2017 season, and assistant coach Dan Canevari filled in for him as acting head coach while Cador recovered.\nDue to poor record-keeping by athletic department personnel between 2010 and 2015, 218 student athletes from 15 sports teams at Southern were linked to rules infractions by the NCAA; it is not immediately clear how many, if any, of Cador's 137 wins from that time period may have been vacated by the NCAA. However, with various unresolved Academic Progress Rate issues, the NCAA limited recruiting efforts, scholarship awards, practice time, and postseason participation for the incoming head coach.\nOn July 26, 2017 Southern announced the hiring of Kerrick Jackson as coach. He attended St. Louis Community College–Meramec and then Bethune–Cookman, but later transferred to Nebraska. He led Southern to a 9–33 (.214) record in his first season at the helm. His second team went 32–24 (.571), won the SWAC Western Division, the SWAC, the \"blackcollegenines.com\" Large School Division HBCU national championship, and qualified for the BCSG 360 HBCU World Series (which was later canceled due to inclement weather). Southern also made a return to the NCAA tournament. His third team was 6–10 when the NCAA canceled all spring sports competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Jackson resigned on November 30, 2020, and Chris Crenshaw was named the interim head coach.\nSince 1949 (when Lee became coach) and through the 2019 season, the team's overall record is 1,795–1,002–8 (.641) on the field—before any wins from 2010 to 2015 that may have been vacated by the NCAA are factored in.\nPlayers.\nIn 1985 Brock was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2011 Goodwin became the first former HBCU player inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 2012 Brock became the second.\nMajor League Baseball.\nSouthern has had 96 Major League Baseball Draft selections since the draft began in 1965."

The team is a member of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, which is part of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I. The team plays its home games at James J. McCann Baseball Field in Poughkeepsie, New York. Baseball was added to the Marist Athletic Department in the fall of 1990 and their inaugural season was 1991. The Red Foxes are coached by Lance Ratchford.\nPostseason history.\nThe program has appeared in six NCAA Division I Baseball Championships, as of the end of the 2013 season.\nThe first came in 1997, with a team led by All-American Mark Barron and two future Major League draftees, Jorge Santiago and Mike Speckhardt. The Red Foxes qualified for the tournament by winning the NEC tournament and appeared in the East Regional, hosted by Florida State University. The Foxes went 0–2 in the Regional, losing to No. 4 Florida State 4–2 in their first game.\nIn 2000, the Red Foxes swept through the MAAC tournament to win the conference championship. In the Lafayette Regional, the team won the program's first NCAA tournament game, 6–5 over McNeese State. It also lost 8–7 in 11 innings against top-seeded East Carolina. Senior catcher Anthony Ambrosini and sophomore Anthony Bocchino were both named to the All-Regional Team. The Red Foxes also had two All-America nominees in Bocchino (.404 batting average and 90 hits) and freshman pitcher Kevin Ool (6–4, 2.42 ERA).\nIn 2001, the Red Foxes earned their second consecutive MAAC title, extending their tournament unbeaten streak to five games. The 2001 team also had a successful tournament. In the Palo Alto Regional, the Red Foxes defeated Long Beach State, which had the second-highest number of draft picks in the country in that year's Major League Baseball Draft. The 2001 team had two All-Americans (Anthony Bocchino and Tim Bittner). Bittner was drafted in the 10th round by the Chicago White Sox. Rookie left-hander Chris Tracz was named to the Louisville Slugger/\"Baseball America\" All-Rookie Team, after posting a 10–1 record (with his only loss coming against nationally ranked Stanford).\nThe 2002 team won a program-record 41 games, also winning the program's first MAAC Regular season Title. The team won the MAAC Tournament and extended its tournament win streak to eight games, going undefeated in the tournament for the third consecutive season. The team was seeded third in the Lincoln Regional. In the opener, they upset Southwest Missouri State, 5–4, with an 11th-inning home run, to advance to the winner's bracket. The win marked the third straight season in which Marist won an NCAA Regional game. Bocchino was named MAAC Player of the Year and was drafted in the 11th round by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bocchino earned Second Team All-America honors for the second straight year, as well. Tracz won 10 games for the second straight season and was named the MAAC Pitcher of the Year.\nThe 2005 team rebounded from a 1–11 start to finish the season at 33–19 and win its second MAAC Regular season Championship. Marist again swept through the MAAC Tournament, defeating Niagara, 5–3, in the final to capture its fourth tournament championship in six years and to qualify for the program's fifth NCAA tournament. The Red Foxes traveled to the Baton Rouge Regional, which included LSU, Rice and Northwestern State. Marist led No. 18 LSU Tigers 4–0 early in the Regional opener, but went on to lose the game.\nRivalries.\nSince 2006, Marist has played Army in the Hudson Valley Baseball Classic at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, NY. Many Marist players refer to the annual showdown with Army as the \"Hudson Valley Death Match.\" The game is usually highlighted by Cadets parachuting onto the field and presenting the game ball and an impressive fireworks show."

This was the second and last edition with 24 teams before expanding to 32 teams for the 2023 tournament in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe United States entered the competition as defending champions after winning the 2015 edition in Canada and successfully defended their title with a 2–0 victory over the Netherlands in the final. In doing so, they secured their record fourth title and became the second nation, after Germany, to have successfully retained the title. Unlike Germany, however, this victory held a distinction as the United States won both 2015 and 2019 tournaments under one manager, Jill Ellis. It was the first time in 81 years since Vittorio Pozzo did so for the Italian men's team at the 1934 and 1938 FIFA World Cups.\nThe matches were broadcast globally and attracted a combined audience of 1.12 billion people.\nHost selection.\nOn 6 March 2014, FIFA announced that bidding had begun for the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Member associations interested in hosting the tournament had to submit a declaration of interest by 15 April 2014, and provide the complete set of bidding documents by 31 October 2014. As a principle, FIFA preferred the 2019 Women's World Cup and the 2018 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup to be hosted by the same member association, but reserved the right to award the hosting of the events separately.\nInitially, five countries indicated interest in hosting the events: France, England, South Korea, New Zealand and South Africa. Both England and New Zealand registered expressions of interest by the April 2014 deadline, but in June 2014 it was announced that each would no longer proceed. South Africa registered an expression of interest by the April 2014 deadline; but later decided to withdraw prior to the final October deadline. Both Japan and Sweden had also expressed interest in bidding for the 2019 tournament, but Japan chose to focus on the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics, whilst Sweden decided to focus on European U-17 competitions instead. France and South Korea made official bids for hosting the tournament by submitting their documents by 31 October 2014.\nOn 19 March 2015, France officially won the bid to host the Women's World Cup and the U-20 Women's World Cup. The decision came after a vote by the FIFA Executive Committee. Upon the selection, France became the third European nation to host the Women's World Cup (following Sweden and Germany), and the fourth country to host both the men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's tournament in 1938 and 1998. By the time France hosted the women's World Cup, the country had also earlier hosted the UEFA Euro 2016, which served as a precursor for France's preparation to host this competition.\nQualification.\nThe slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Council on 13–14 October 2016. The slots for each confederation are unchanged from those of the previous tournament except the slot for the hosts has been moved from CONCACAF (Canada) to UEFA (France).\nQualifying matches started on 3 April 2017 and ended on 1 December 2018.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams qualified for the final tournament. Each team's FIFA Rankings in March 2019 are shown in parentheses.\nChile, Jamaica, Scotland and South Africa made their Women's World Cup debuts, while Italy took part in the event for the first time since 1999 and Argentina took part for the first time since 2007. Brazil, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Norway, Sweden and the United States qualified for their eighth World Cup, continuing their streak of qualifying for every World Cup held so far.\nVenues.\nTwelve cities were candidates. The final 9 stadiums were chosen on 14 June 2017; Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes, Stade Marcel-Picot in Nancy, and Stade de l'Abbé-Deschamps in Auxerre were cut.\nThe semi-finals and final were played at Parc Olympique Lyonnais in the Lyon suburb of Décines-Charpieu, with 58,000 capacity, while the opening match was played at Parc des Princes in Paris. The 2019 tournament is the first under the 24-team format to be played without double-header fixtures.\nMatch officials.\nOn 3 December 2018, FIFA announced the list of 27 referees and 48 assistant referees for the tournament. On 4 June 2019, FIFA announced that Canadian referee Carol Anne Chenard and Chinese assistant referee Cui Yongmei had pulled out for \"health reasons.\"\nOn 15 March 2019, the FIFA Council approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time in a FIFA Women's World Cup tournament. The technology was previously deployed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The fifteen male VAR officials were announced by FIFA on 2 May 2019.\nFrench referee Stéphanie Frappart was in charge for the final between the United States and the Netherlands.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 8 December 2018, 18:00 CET (), at the La Seine Musicale on the island of Île Seguin, Boulogne-Billancourt. The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams.\nThe 24 teams were allocated to four pots based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings released on 7 December 2018, with hosts France automatically placed in Pot 1 and position A1 in the draw. Teams from Pot 1 were drawn first and assigned to Position 1. This was followed by Pot 2, Pot 3, and finally Pot 4, with each of these teams also drawn to one of the positions 2–4 within their group. No group could contain more than one team from each confederation apart from UEFA, which have nine teams, where three groups had to contain two UEFA teams.\nSquads.\nEach team had to provide to FIFA a preliminary squad of between 23 and 50 players by 26 April 2019, which was not to be published. From the preliminary squad, each team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 24 May 2019. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nThe match schedule for the tournament was released on 8 February 2018. Following the final draw, seven group stage kick-off times were adjusted by FIFA.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\nAll times are local, CEST ().\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best third-placed teams from the six groups advanced to the knockout stage along with the six group winners and six runners-up.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each), where each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution. If the score was still level after extra time, the winners were determined by a penalty shoot-out.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. The Golden Ball (best overall player), Golden Boot (top scorer) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper) awards were sponsored by Adidas, while the Goal of the Tournament was sponsored by Hyundai Motor Company. FIFA.com shortlisted ten goals for users to vote on as the tournaments' best, with the poll closing on 17 July 2019.\nPlayers who Dared to Shine.\nThe FIFA Technical Study Group announced a list of ten key players of the tournament who \"dared to shine\".\nPrize money.\nPrize money amounts were announced in October 2018.\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nBranding.\nThe emblem and slogan were launched on 19 September 2017 at the Musée de l'Homme in Paris. The emblem mimics the shape of the World Cup trophy and features a stylised football surrounded by eight decorative shards of light, symbolising the eighth edition of the Women's World Cup. It alludes to several French cultural icons:\nThe World Cup's official English-language slogan is \"Dare to Shine\"; its French slogan is \"Le moment de briller\".\nTicketing.\nFIFA and the local organising committee sold tickets for the Women's World Cup beginning with a pre-sale of individual tickets in December 2018, single-city ticket packages in late 2018, and single-ticket sales for the general public beginning on 7 March 2019. The online platform, hosted by AP2S, permitted fans to print their tickets beginning on 20 May 2019, which included seating assignments that had separated ticketholders who had purchased their tickets as a group or family. FIFA responded to online complaints by referring to a warning in the online system that had reminded purchasers that its tickets would not be guaranteed in the same areas, inciting further outrage, but allowed families with underage children to have adjacent seating.\nMarketing.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot, \"Ettie\" (stylised in lowercase as \"ettie) was unveiled on 12 May 2018 at the TF1 Group headquarters, and was broadcast on LCI. She made her first public appearance in Paris in front of the iconic Eiffel Tower. FIFA describe her as \"a young chicken with a passion for life and football\" and state that \"she comes from a long line of \"feathered mascots\" and is the daughter of Footix, the Official Mascot of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France\".\nBroadcasting.\nFIFA sold the broadcasting rights for the World Cup to broadcasters through several companies. A total of 1.12 billion people globally watched the matches, and the final match attracted 82.18 million viewers, setting a new FIFA Women's World Cup record, surpassing the 2015 final. The 2019 tournament set several new viewership records for various countries.\nQualified UEFA teams for the Summer Olympics.\nThe World Cup was used by UEFA to qualify three teams for the 2020 Summer Olympic women's football tournament in Japan, with the three European teams with the best results (considering only the round they reach) qualifying. If teams in contention for Olympic spots were eliminated in the same round, a maximum of four teams (determined by group stage results if necessary) would advance to play-offs in early 2020 to decide the remaining spot(s). However, this scenario did not happen for this tournament.\nFor the first time, as per the agreement between the four British football associations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales) for the women's team, Great Britain would attempt to qualify for the Olympics through England's performance in the World Cup (a procedure already successfully employed by Team GB in field hockey and rugby sevens), which they succeeded as England were among the three best European teams. Scotland also qualified for the World Cup but, under the agreement whereby the highest ranked home nation was nominated to compete for the purposes of Olympic qualification, their performance would not be taken into account. In effect, therefore, eight European teams competed for three qualification places during the World Cup.\nThe United States' win over France in the quarter-finals guaranteed that the three remaining semi-finalists, all from UEFA, qualified for the Olympics.\nControversies.\nThe final's scheduling on 7 July led to a degree of criticism among supporters of women's football, as two continental men's tournament finals were held on the same day—the Copa América in Rio de Janeiro and the CONCACAF Gold Cup in Chicago. CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani described the scheduling as \"a mistake\", but claimed the error could not be reversed for logistical reasons. The lack of outdoor advertising across Paris, except for the Parc des Princes stadium and the temporary World Cup museum at Châtelet, was also criticised.\nThe Women's World Cup was the first major competition to use the updated Laws of the Game approved by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), which came into effect on 1 June 2019. Among the changes, the more severe punishment of goalkeeper encroachment during penalty kicks—including retakes after a video assistant referee review—gained the most attention and caused several successful saves to be disallowed in the group stage. The use of the Women's World Cup as a \"guinea pig\" for the new changes to the rules was also criticised by some footballers and coaches for being potentially sexist, as several concurrent men's continental competitions had not implemented them. Pierluigi Collina, head of referees for FIFA, denied the claim, stating that it had long been customary for rule changes to be introduced in June, before major tournaments. Following widespread criticism and a request from FIFA, the IFAB issued a temporary dispensation to waive the requirement to show goalkeepers a yellow card for stepping off the line during a penalty shootout during the knockout stage of the Women's World Cup.\nThe round of 16 fixture between England and Cameroon was marred by misbehaviour of some Cameroonian players, who refused to kick off for several minutes after the second English goal, deliberately fouled several players, and argued with the referee while huddling around her. Cameroonian defender Augustine Ejangue was also seen on camera spitting at English winger Toni Duggan after conceding an indirect free kick in the penalty area, from which England later scored. After the match, England manager Phil Neville said it \"didn't feel like football\" and that he was \"completely and utterly ashamed of the opposition\". The Confederation of African Football (CAF) condemned some of the players' actions, while also criticising the refereeing. Cameroon felt three crucial decisions were unjust, two of which involved the video assistant referee (VAR). FIFA announced that it would investigate the match."

Eight teams of five gymnasts competed, from a total of twelve teams that had qualified for the Games.\nThe eight teams with the best combined scores in the qualification round moved on to the final. In the final, each team selected three gymnasts to compete on each apparatus. All scores were summed to give a final team score.\nChina won the gold medal with a total score of 275.997. In second place with 271.952 points was Japan, and Great Britain took bronze with 271.711.\nControversy.\nEntering the last rotation of the final, China held the lead, followed by Japan, Ukraine, and Great Britain. Great Britain earned high scores on the floor exercise, allowing them to surpass Ukraine in the standings despite a solid rings programme from the Ukrainians. Meanwhile, however, Japan was encountering problems on its final apparatus, the pommel horse. First, Kazuhito Tanaka fell, earning a low score of 13.433. Then Kōhei Uchimura had a bad dismount and received a score of 13.466: knocking Japan down to fourth place, and moving Great Britain into second and Ukraine into third.\nThe Japanese team filed an appeal, arguing that Uchimura's difficulty score (D-score) had been incorrectly downgraded for his dismount, which—while executed poorly—was landed without a fall. After an in-depth video review by the Men's Technical Committee, headed by Adrian Stoica of Romania, Uchimura's dismount was given full difficulty credit (0.7 points for the G-level skill). This increased his total score to 14.166, giving Japan the silver medal and Great Britain the bronze, and knocking Ukraine to fourth place."

Sixty-seven teams competed in NCAA Division III women's hockey across eight conferences in the 2023–24 season.\nConferences.\nConference affiliations and the conferences themselves experienced numerous changes in the later part of the 2010s. The most substantial alterations occurred with the founding of the Colonial Hockey Conference (CHC) in 2015 and the folding of ECAC West in 2017, which precipitated the creation of the Northeast Women's Hockey League (NEWHL) in the same year. The conferences and affiliations presented below are accurate through the 2019–20 season.\nA conference with seven or more affiliated programs automatically qualifies for the NCAA DIII Women's Ice Hockey Tournament. In practice, the Colonial Hockey Conference (CHC) and the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) are the only conferences that do not receive automatic bids for the tournament. \nThe Anna Maria Amcats women's ice hockey program of Anna Maria College in Paxton, Massachusetts has participated in the NCAA Division III as an independent team (ie. without conference affiliation) since the 2018–19 season. \nCoommonwealth Coast Conference.\nThe Commonwealth Coast Conference (CCC) is a college athletic conference which operates in New England. It added women's ice hockey by taking over the former Colonial Hockey Conference (CHC; previously ECAC North Atlantic) in 2020. As of the 2023–24 season, there are five member programs:\nMinnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.\nThe Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) is a college athletic conference located in Minnesota.

St. Thomas was replaced by St. Scholastica.\nNew England Hockey Conference.\nThe New England Hockey Conference (NEHC; previously ECAC East) is an ice hockey-only conference which operates in New England. As of the 2019–20 season, there are nine member programs in the women's division: \nNew England Small College Athletic Conference.\nThe New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) is a college athletic conference of liberal arts colleges and universities located in New England and New York.

It was founded in 2017 by the women's ice hockey teams of five schools in the State University of New York Athletic Conference (SUNYAC); its membership was increased to seven programs in 2019–20. The programs competing in the NEWHL are:\nNorthern Collegiate Hockey Association.\nThe Northern Collegiate Hockey Association (NCHA) is a hockey-only conference, which operates in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

It was devised with the aim of a simplified and more accessible version of golf.\nThe game is played along a distance of about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) on which the players, two per team, with as few strokes as possible, have to reach the final hole, hitting a soft polyurethane ball with a classic golf club.\nHistory.\nBeach golf was created in Pescara, Italy in 1999 by Mauro De Marco. \nIt was designed to be played on crowded beaches during the summer. Objects on the beach are incorporated into the game. Beach umbrellas, bathing people and other objects are turned into obstacles of the game. The rules allow the audience to interact with participants.\nThe game, developed by BGSA (Beach Golf Sport Association), has been recognized by the Centro Sportivo Educativo Nazionale (National Educational Sports Centre) and by the Italian National Olympic Committee.\nIn the summer of 2014, in Montesilvano, was organized the first edition of the European Beach Golf Contest, an international event which was attended by 90 athletes representing 18 European nations. The 7 days of competition have seen the triumph of the Irish Robert Cast, who took home the first continental title.\nNotable competitions have included the Jeckerson Cup 2005 held in the Piazza del Campo, Siena. The competition was held between 40 teams from different nations. Teams competed in the streets in a “We Golf” race (variant of Beach golf on the street) and were followed by a crowd of 80000 people.\nIn the following years tours were conducted during the summer on the beaches of the Italian coast.\nBeach golf has been discussed on an Italian national television network and on Radio Kiss Kiss.\nSpace was also given to Beach golf in the Rimini Wellness Fair, and Sports Day.\nRules.\nRegulations have been created for the Beach Golf Event, aiming to anticipate various kinds of situations. The main rule states that people and things constitute natural obstacles on the path.\nThe game takes place along a path of 2 km of sandy coastline on the beach, where 40 teams of two players each (a pro and a beginner), challenge each other to arrive at the final hole with the fewest possible strokes. The game-track is not bounded by any type of border and is punctuated by beach umbrellas and bathers that become natural obstacles throughout the competition.\nBecause of the crowded place where the event takes place, the ball used is made of soft polyurethane foam to prevent injury to anyone who is accidentally hit during the game. The route is accompanied throughout its track by music and entertainment that involve, in an original way, the audience that becomes active in the field of play.\nThe range of the golfer beach is bordered by a protection zone of about 5 meters, supported by three girls on the way to accompany throughout the game.\nTeam.\nEach team is composed of two players, a low-handicap player and a high-handicap one. The sum of the two handicaps split approximately to the next lower (e.g.: mean 17.5, the team is hcp 17) and that is the team's handicap that show how many improvements can benefit the team.\nThe game is played with only one beaten ball each turn. It is admitted that the one it replaces the other, in case you lose stroke and distance. Penalty: loss of stroke and distance.\nScorecard.\nThe scorecard is a table which shows the data about the team and the history of the game. It consists of nine items:\nGame.\nIt is a stroke-game competition held in two rounds. Two types of balls are used: a soft rubber, totally harmless ( 69 mm in diameter ) which is used along the track and a regular one on the green. There is no time limit. Players have the opportunity to stop to have a lunch break, however, teams must respect the assigned starting time.\nTrack.\nThis goes along the shore of any beach. When the Beach Golf is held in Pescara, we start from Paolucci Square and arrive at Stadium of the Sea, close to Cascella's Ship. The track has a length of 1600 meters and a width that take the whole beach.\nThe starting area.\nThe starting area is located where the first ball is hit. The area consists of a synthetic rug 1.50x1.50 m2. The ball is placed on the appropriate tee and both players choose a tee shot, placing the balls in the best possible way. The honor is given (noblesse oblige) to the lower handicap player. Any missed shot or barely touched balls are considered as a shot along the path. If the ball is dropped from the tee without being touched can be repositioned to make the shot.\nEach team starts three minutes after the previous one. The delay allowed is ten minutes after the departure of the next team. The laggard team start for last with a penalty of five shots.\nEquipment.\nThe equipment used consist in a classic golf club, expanded foam balls and a protection belt.\nClubs.\nPreferably sand or wedge type.\nBall.\nThe ball is made of polyurethane foam with a diameter of 7 cm and a weigh of 35g approximately. Its composition makes them harmless, allowing to play anywhere.\nProtection belt.\nThis is held by the Caddy Girls and has a very important function which is to guarantee the safety of bathers, the players and anyone who is on the game-track. This is what makes the Beach Golf the only sport in the world where viewers are on the pitch and involved as active part in the game.\nCaddy Girls.\nCaddy Girls act both as game-judges and hostesses during the event. Their role is to ensure that the game takes place in a proper and safe way. The Caddy Girls support a protection belt around the area of action, aiming to allow the golfer to play in peace among the bathers, beach chairs and umbrellas.\nThe BGSA has planned a special calendar, featuring the Beach golf Caddy Girls."

        "title": "1950 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1950 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the eight season of the circuit. The teams Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kenosha Comets, Muskegon Lassies, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 112-game schedule.\nIn 1950 the league used a livelier 10 inches ball. Finally, the batting was able to take advantage of the pitching, when five hitters reached the .300 average mark for the year. Fort Wayne's rookie Betty Foss led the circuit with a .346 average, to set a new season mark.\nNevertheless, three no-hitters were recorded in the season, two of them by Jean Cione of Kenosha during the month of August. Her first was a 12-inning gem against Grand Rapids, and the second came in a seven-inning shutout over Racine. Previously, Kenosha's Ruby Stephens had pitched a nine-inning no-no against the Lassies in July.\nGrand Rapids' Alma Ziegler posted a 19–7 record and a solid 1.38 earned run average in 35 games, leading all pitchers in winning percentage (.732). She also tossed 43 straight shutout inning, and finished second in ERA behind South Bend's Jean Faut (1.12). Ziegler was honored with the Player of the Year Award.\nThe league returned to the Shaugnessy format during the playoffs, featuring the top four teams of the season. In the best-of-five first round, first place Rockford won Kenosha and second place Fort Wayne defeated fourth place Grand Rapids. The final series took all seven games to decide the champion team. After winning the first two games, Rockford lost the next two games to Fort Wayne. Rockford took a 3–2 advantage in Game 5, but Fort Wayne won the next contest to send the series to a seventh game. Finally, Rockford never gave Fort Wayne a chance at another upset and won the series, four to three games. Helen Nicol was credited with three of the four victories of Rockford in the finals, including a shutout in decisive Game 7. Bill Allington guided the Peaches to their third title in a row, fourth overall, to set two all-time records for a manager.\nIn 1950 the AAGPBL declined in attendance for the second consecutive year. Poor financial management finally caught up to the league and it began to slide. At the end of the season, team directors voted to purchase the league from Arthur Meyerhoff and operate their teams independently. That season had been a nightmare for Muskegon, after registering the worst record in the circuit and a relocation during the midseason to Kalamazoo, Michigan, where the team was renamed the Kalamazoo Lassies. Besides this, the Racine franchise, a two-time champion and one of the four original teams, had to move to Battle Creek, Michigan. The team would be renamed the Battle Creek Belles for the next season."

He won 28 of 39 decisions in the lower and middle levels of minor league baseball during his first two seasons in pro ball, paving the way for his brief trial with the 1958 Pirates. His four-game stint included three well-pitched games, and one poor outing. The disappointing appearance came in his third MLB contest against the Los Angeles Dodgers, newly moved to Perez' native Southern California. On May 2, 1958, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Perez relieved starting pitcher Bennie Daniels in the fourth inning with the Pirates leading 5–2. Daniels departed with one out and two runners on base. Perez allowed the inherited runners to score, gave up three more runs of his own, and recorded only one out before he was relieved by Curt Raydon. Perez was tagged with the eventual 9–5 defeat.\nHowever, in Perez' other three games, encompassing eight full innings, he allowed only two earned runs against the Milwaukee Braves, Cincinnati Redlegs and San Francisco Giants.

Other modifications occurred during 1948. The ball was decreased in size from to , while the base paths were lengthened to 72 feet and the pitching distance increased to 50 feet.\nThe Chicago Colleens and the Springfield Sallies were added to the previous roster that included the Kenosha Comets, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Muskegon Lassies, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The Chicago, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Muskegon and South Bend teams were aligned in the East Division, while Kenosha, Peoria, Racine, Rockford and Springfield played in the Western Division. The number of games in the schedule increased from 112 to 126.\nFor the second consecutive year the AAGPBL spring training camp was held in Havana, Cuba. as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. Around two hundred girls made the trip. Among them, players represented 27 different states in the United States and many provinces of Canada, while several Cuban players entered the league as a result of holding spring training there the year before. A total of 21 players had been in the league since its foundation in 1943.\nThe fact of two divisions resulted in the Shaughnessy system adding another round of playoffs to decide the championship between eight teams. The first round faced the top teams of each division in a best-of-three series, with the first place team playing against the third place team and the second place team against the fourth place team. The winners competed in a best-of-five divisional first round, with the first place team facing the third place team and the second place team against the fourth place team. The sectional champions then advanced to the third round and faced in the best-of-seven Championship Series.\nPitchers continued to dominate the league in that season even though many of them could not adapt to the new pitching style. Grand Rapids' Alice Haylett led all pitchers with a 0.77 earned run average, while 20 averaged at least a 1.99 mark. In addition, Haylett and Racine's Eleanor Dapkus hurled 10 shutouts a piece. The only .300 hitter was Kenosha's Audrey Wagner (.312), who also led the circuit in hits (130) and total bases (186). At the end of the season Wagner was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award.\nThe Grand Rapids and Racine teams won their respective division. In the first round, Grand Rapids, Fort Wayne, Racine and Rockford swept South Bend, Muskegon, Peoria and Kenosha, respectively. In the divisional playoffs, Fort Wayne swept Grand Rapids and Rockford did the same with Racine. Then, Rockford jumped out to a three-game lead in the final series and defeated Fort Wayne four games to one. Helen Nicol was credited with four of the 10 playoff wins of Rockford, including two in the finals, while Lois Florreich and Margaret Holgerson took three a piece. In Game 1 of the first round, Florreich pitched the first no-hitter in series history, and Holgerson threw a second no-hitter in Game 3 to set an all-time record for the most playoff no-hitters. Another highlight came in the first round, when South Bend's Jean Faut outdueled Haylett of Grand Rapids, 3–2, in 20 innings, in what would be the longest game in AAGPBL playoff history.\nThe league drew almost a million fans for the second consecutive season, although the Chicago and Springfield franchises failed to reach the attendance required. Then, the Colleens and the Sallies were turned into player development teams that toured and played exhibition games to recruit and train new players. The tour started in Chicago and ended up in Canada, including stops in Yankee Stadium and Griffith Stadium."

        "title": "UC Riverside Highlanders baseball",
        "text": "The UC Riverside baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball team of the University of California, Riverside, located in Riverside, California, United States. The program has been a member of the NCAA Division I Big West Conference since the start of the 2002 season. The program's home venue is the Riverside Sports Complex, located on the university's campus. Justin Johnson serves as the team's interim head coach starting with the 2021 season. The program has won two Division II national championships. It has appeared in four Division II College World Series and 12 NCAA tournaments (two in Division I). It has won eight California Collegiate Athletic Association championships and one Big West Conference championship. As of the start of the 2013 Major League Baseball season, 16 former Highlanders have appeared in Major League Baseball.\nHistory.\nAlthough the school traces its history to the early 20th century, the University of California, Riverside opened for classes in February 1954. It adopted the Highlanders nickname in a student election held later that year. The varsity baseball program was founded shortly thereafter, beginning play in 1958.\nDivision II.\nLittle record exists of the program's early years, though it competed as an Independent in the NCAA College Division (made up of small-school athletic programs) through the end of the 1970 season. Don Edwards, who had assisted in the development of the program prior to its first season, became the program's second head coach prior to the 1960 season. From 1965 to 1968, future UC Irvine and UCLA head coach Gary Adams was an assistant coach under Edwards.\nOn September 2, 1970, John Lowenstein became the first program alumnus to appear in Major League Baseball, as he debuted for the Cleveland Indians. Lowenstein went on to have a 16-year major league career. While at UC Riverside, Lowenstein had become the first athlete in school history to be awarded an athletic scholarship.\nPrior to the start of the 1971 season, the program joined the College Division's California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). It finished well below .500 in its first three seasons in the league. In August 1973, the NCAA reorganized its divisions. Prior to then, the NCAA had competed in two divisions, a large-school University Division and a small-school College Division. Following the reorganization, the University Division became Division I, while the College Division split into Division II and Division III. UC Riverside became a Division II Independent.\nAlso following the 1973 season, Emporia State coach Jack Smitheran was hired as the program's third head coach. The team's play improved soon after his hiring. In 1975, the Highlanders appeared in their first Division II NCAA tournament. In the West Regional, the team defeated Chapman, 9–8, before being eliminated by Cal State Northridge, 8–1.\nIn 1977, the program returned to the NCAA tournament and won the Division II National Championship. After winning the CCAA with a 15–9 conference record, the team earned a berth in the West Regional. After advancing through the West Regional with wins over Cal State Northridge and Cal State Hayward, the program played in the Division II College World Series. There, it went 5–1, defeating Eckerd 4–1 in the championship game. Future major leaguers Steve Lubratich and Eric Show played on the championship team.\nThe Highlanders' home venue, the Riverside Sports Complex, hosted the Division II College World Series from 1980 to 1984. The team qualified for two World Series played on its home field. In 1981, the team won the West Regional, but was eliminated after losing consecutive World Series games to Florida Southern and Cal State Northridge. In 1982, the team again qualified for the NCAA tournament and won the West Regional. In the World Series, the Highlanders won their second Division II National Championship with victories over Longwood, New Haven, and Florida Southern twice. Future major leaguer Calvin Jones played on the 1982 team.\nFor the seven straight seasons from 1983 to 1989, the program failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament, despite finishing with an above-.500 CCAA record in six of the seven years. In the 1990s, however, the team qualified for seven NCAA tournaments (1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1999). On one occasion, in 1991, it advanced to the Division II College World Series, the program's fourth appearance. After losing to SIU Edwardsville in its first game, the team won consecutive games over Shippensburg, SIU Edwardsville, and Jacksonville State. In the championship game, however, the team lost to Jacksonville State 5–2. In 1995, the Highlanders entered the West Regional finals with a 43–15 record, but were upset by UC Davis, which had entered the game at 29–30.\nDivision I.\nIn February 2000, UC Riverside announced that it would move to Division I in the 2000–2001 academic year and join the Big West Conference in the 2001–2002 academic year. After spending the 2001 season as an Independent, the baseball program played its first Big West season in 2002.\nCompared to many of the school's other athletic programs, the baseball program transitioned successfully to Division I. Beginning in 2002, it had an above-.500 overall record in six consecutive Division I seasons. In 2003, the Highlanders finished third in the Big West and received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. As the #3 seed in the Palo Alto Regional, the team beat Richmond 10–8 in its opening game. It was then eliminated after losing consecutive games to regional host Stanford and Richmond.\nFollowing the 2004 season, Jack Smitheran retired as the program's head coach. In 31 seasons, Smitheran had a record of 974–729–3 and won two Division II National Championships. Following his retirement, Smitheran worked for the Seattle Mariners as a scouting advisor. He had been inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2002, the UC Riverside Hall of Fame in 2004, and had his number #2 retired by the program in 2006. He was replaced by Doug Smith, who had been an assistant coach with the program since the 1983 season.\nPrior to the 2007 season, an unused storage building near the Riverside Sports Complex was renovated and converted into the team's home clubhouse. Program alumnus Troy Percival both paid for the improvements and renovated the building himself.\nIn the 2007 season, the team went 38–21 and won the Big West title, thus receiving an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as a #2 seed in the Tempe Regional. As in 2003, the team won its opening game, 10–5, against Nebraska. It then lost consecutive games to Arizona State and Nebraska and was eliminated.\nSmith coached the team through the end of the 2014 season, when he retired. In that seven-year stretch, the program had three winning seasons and finished as high as third in the Big West; it did not qualify for the postseason.

        "text": "Street League Skateboarding (SLS) is an international skateboarding tournament series. The league features professional street skateboarders competing for the largest monetary prize in the history of skateboarding, and was founded by professional skateboarder and entrepreneur Rob Dyrdek.\nCalifornia Skateparks designs and builds the SLS courses.\nHistory.\nThe idea for SLS first arose when Rob Dyrdek was dissatisfied with the state of professional street skateboarding competitions. Seeking to address the flaws of the existing system, Dyrdek developed the SLS. During its launch in 2010, Dyrdek said: \"It has been a dream of mine to create a professional tour that bridges the gap between true street skateboarding and contest skating, which to date has been fragmented and misguided.\"\nThe inaugural year of SLS featured a four-stop arena tour that began at the Jobing.com Arena in Glendale, Arizona on August 28, 2010. The other venues for the inaugural tour were the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California on September 11, 2010, and the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada on September 25, 2010.\nThe 2011 Super Crown World Champion was Sean Malto, who upset Nyjah Huston for his first Street League win and the US$200,000 first place prize. Huston went on to win the competition in 2012, in addition to a championship watch and ring set from Nixon Watches, and a Chevy Sonic vehicle.\nIn May 2013, the GoPro camera company was announced as the official camera sponsor of the 2013 SLS international tour. GoPro, which sponsors SLS contestants Ryan Sheckler and Malto, was used to feature the broadcasts of the domestic American events, including course previews and real-time impact highlights. As of May 19, 2013, Huston had won more prize money than any other skateboarder in history.\nThe 2013 Super Crown World Champion, Chris Cole, also earned his first career SLS win earlier in 2013 at the Street League at X Games stop in Munich, Germany. Huston and Luan Oliveira placed second and third respectively. Paul Rodriguez won his second SLS stop in Portland, Oregon in July 2013.\nIn March 2014, SLS signed a broadcasting deal with Fox Sports 1.\nIn 2018, SLS announced a partnership with World Skate, under which it became the body's official world tour series and world championship through 2020. The SLS World Tour also became the main qualifying path for skateboarding at the 2020 Summer Olympics. The move was criticized by Tim McFerran, president of the World Skateboarding Grand Prix (who had been attempting to negotiate his own body, the World Skateboarding Federation, as the sanctioning body for Olympic skateboarding), citing the invitational nature of the events, and concerns that they would hold a near-monopoly over professional skateboarding and the athletes who compete at the Olympics. \nIn May 2019, it was announced that skateboarding would be dropped from the 2019 Pan American Games, with Panam Sports citing SLS and World Skate's decision to schedule a World Tour event in direct conflict with the Games schedule, and not have the Pan American Games be a qualifying event for the Olympics. Panam Sports argued that these decisions diminished the quality of the field, and showed a \"lack of respect\" on behalf of the entities.\nIn 2020, SLS merged with Nitro Circus and Superjacket Productions to form Thrill One Sports and Entertainment with The Raine Group. It was in turn acquired by Lorenzo Fertitta's Fiume Capital and Juggernaut Capital Partners, with co-investment from Dana White. In 2023, as a consequence of the acquisition, broadcasts of SLS events moved to alt-tech video platform Rumble in 2023.\nOverview.\nThe SLS contestants accumulate points at each pre-championship stop and only the top eight ranking contestants compete in the championship event. In the 2023 season, SLS adopted a new format featuring a single-elimination format during finals in order to help build rivalries.\nThe SLS prize purse is the largest in the history of competitive professional skateboarding, and was worth US$1.6 million in 2011.\nSLSF and SLSCSP.\nIn 2013, the Street League Skateboarding Foundation (SLSF) was established with the goal of increasing global participation in skateboarding. The Foundation assists municipalities and non-profits with the design, development, and construction of legal Skate Plazas, as well as assisting with the creation of community and educational programs that promote skateboarding.\nAn extension of SLS, \"Street League Skateboarding Certified Skate Parks\" (SLSCSP) built three plazas in 2013. The plazas will eventually become the locations for SLS amateur and televised qualifier contests. Locations include Erie, Colorado; the Kennesaw Skatepark in Kennesaw, Georgia; and Lake Havasu City, Arizona.\n2013 SLS World Tour.\nSLS at Kansas City, Missouri.\nHighest Scored Trick Presented by Monster Energy: Nyjah Huston\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140116101632/http://streetleague.com/archives/kc-monster-highest-scored-trick-nyjah-huston/\nSLS Super Crown at New Jersey.\n2013: Overall Winner, Super Crown World Champion - Chris Cole\nHighest Score Trick Award, presented by Monster Energy - (9.9) Shane O'Neill, Switch Double 360 Flip\nHighest Score Trick Clip http://streetleague.com/ondemand/?__mr_id=67930\n2013 Street League Awards: Street League Skateboarding Awards\n2012 SLS World Tour.\nSLS at Newark, New Jersey.\n2012: Overall Winner - Nyjah Huston\n2011 SLS World Tour.\nSLS at Kansas City, Missouri.\nThe second stop in Kansas City, Missouri, was won by Huston, who scored 72.6 points for his second win of the year.\nSLS at Glendale, Arizona.\nThe third stop, in Glendale, Arizona, was won by Huston, who scored 77.8 points; the victory was Huston's fourth.\nSLS at Newark, New Jersey.\nMalto, scoring an 81.2, became the 2011 Street League Champion by winning stop 4 of the year.\n2011: Overall Winner, Super Crown World Champion - Sean Malto\n2010 SLS World Tour.\nSLS at Glendale, Arizona.\nNyjah Huston placed first at the first ever Street League contest in Glendale, Arizona, scoring a 116.0\nSLS at Ontario, California.\nFirst place for the 2010 Ontario, California, stop was awarded to Sean Malto, who scored 120.4 points\nSLS at Las Vegas, Nevada.\nShane O'Neill, scoring 146.0 points, won the final 2010 stop in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n2010: Overall Winner, Super Crown World Champion - Nyjah Huston"

Four years later it was interrupted due to World War Two. The competition was resumed in 1944, with MAI becoming a second powerhouse. In 1949 Dynamo Kyiv became the first non-Russian team to win the championship.\nIn 1959 Dynamo Moscow represented the Soviet Union in the inaugural edition of the European Cup. That same year the championship was won by Latvian team Daugava Riga, which soon established itself as the championship's major powerhouse, winning every edition of the tournament in the 1960s. Daugava's hegemony loosened somewhat in the 1970s, losing the 1974 and 1978 championships to Spartak Leningrad and Spartak Moscow, but still the Latvians, led by Uljana Semjonova, won every other edition until 1984.\nIn the second half of the 1980s Russian teams took again the lead, with CSKA Moscow and Dynamo Novosibirsk entering the competition's palmares. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the championship was closed after the 1991 edition, which was won by Dynamo Kyiv. A CIS Championship was played in 1992 before each republic founded its own national league.\nIn addition to its hegemony in the championship Daugava Riga won a record 18 European Cups between 1960 and 1982, including 12 titles in a row. It was only in 1972 when other Soviet teams had the chance to triumph in Europe with the foundation of the Ronchetti Cup. Spartak Leningrad, Spartak Moscow, CSKA Moscow, Dynamo Novosibirsk, Daugava Riga and Dynamo Kyiv won 12 editions of the tournament."

The Golden Path Trophy is awarded to the winners.\nHistory.\nThe championship has been competed for in U Sports since 1998, when the sport was established in what was then known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union. Prior to that, only teams from Ontario would compete for a women's ice hockey championship.\nThe trophy was donated by Katherine Cartwright in 1998, which is when the championship was first contested. Cartwright was the first head coach of the Queen's Gaels women's hockey program in 1971 and led the movement to reinstate women's hockey at the collegiate level in 1960, following a nine-year hiatus.\nWith the completion of the 2022 championship, the Alberta Pandas have won the most national championships, with eight wins in 10 appearances, followed by the McGill Martlets, with four wins in nine appearances. The Concordia Stingers and Montreal Carabins are next with three and two titles, respectively, followed by six teams with one win each.\nThe 2020 championship tournament was cancelled after two semi-final games had been played due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Ontario, the Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Union (WIAU) existed from 1921–22 to 1970–71, then merged with the Ontario-Quebec University Athletic Association to forme the Ontario Women's Interuniversity Athletic Association (OWIAA), competing from 1971–72 to 1996–97.

        "text": "The 1946 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the fourth season of the circuit. The AAGPBL expansion brought two new franchises to the previous six-team format. At this point, the Muskegon Lassies and the Peoria Redwings joined the Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The eight teams competed through a 112-game schedule, while the final Shaugnessy playoffs faced season winner Racine against defending champion Rockford in a Best of Seven Series.\nOther modifications occurred in the league during 1946. The ball was decreased in size from 11½ inches to 11 inches. In addition, the base paths were lengthened to 70 feet and the sidearm pitching was introduced, as the league was moving toward baseball.\nSeveral pitching records were set during the season. Racine's Anna Mae Hutchison recorded two marks that would never be broken: most innings pitched in a single game (19 against Peoria) and most games pitched in a single season (51). For their part, Fort Wayne's Dorothy Wiltse set the mark for more strikeouts in a season (294), and Racine's Joanne Winter a record for the most consecutive scoreless innings (63). The untiring Wiltse also pitched and won both games of a doubleheader (August 25).\nOther highlights included Grand Rapids' Connie Wisniewski, who led all pitchers with a 0.96 earned run average. Besides this, Winter and Wisniewski combined for 33 wins a piece, the best ever in league history. In addition, Fort Wayne's Audrey Haine and South Bend's Doris Barr and Betty Luna hurled no-hitters. The only position player to top the .300 mark was Rockford's Dorothy Kamenshek (.316), proving that strong pitching is more important than having hot bats.\nFor the second consecutive season, one team won both the season title and the championship. Racine defeated South Bend in the first round, three games to one, and beat the defending champion Rockford in the best-of-seven series in six games. Racine was led by Winter, who won four games in the two playoffs, including a 15-inning, 1–0 victory in the final game of the Shaugnessy series. The Belles also received offensive support from Sophie Kurys, who batted an average of .372 (16-for-43) in 10 playoff games, while setting a postseason record with 16 stolen bases. Kurys also was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award, after hit a second-best .286 while leading with 201 stolen bases and 117 runs.\nIn the first three years after World War II, AAGPBL teams often attracted between two and three thousand fans to a single game. One league highlight occurred in 1946, when an estimated 10,000 people saw a Fourth of July doubleheader in South Bend, Indiana."

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2012 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2012 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists.

        "title": "World League for Sexual Reform",
        "text": "The World League for Sexual Reform was a League for coordinating policy reforms related to greater openness around sex. The initial groundwork for the organisation, including a congress in Berlin which was later counted as the organisation's first, was orchestrated by Magnus Hirschfeld in 1921. It officially came into being at a congress in Copenhagen in 1928.\nPlatform.\nThe organization advocated a ten-point platform which included:\nHistory.\nFrom September 15 to September 21, 1921, Magnus Hirschfeld organised the First International Congress for Sexual Reform on the Basis of Sexual Science in Berlin, which formed the original groundwork for the League. The World League for Sexual Reform officially came into existence on July 3, 1928, at its congress in Copenhagen. Representatives came from many countries: England, the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Russia, Austria, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, Egypt, Liberia, Argentina, Chile, the British Indies, and Malaysia.\nRalf Dose has written an overview of the League. Congresses were held in Copenhagen (1928), London (1929), Vienna (1930), and Brno (1932). Congress speakers included: Hirschfeld, Norman Haire, Vera Brittain, Dora Russell, Charles Vickery Drysdale (from the Malthusian League), Stella Browne, Ernst Gräfenberg, Marie Stopes, M. D. Eder (a pioneer psychiatrist), Laurence Housman, George Ives, Eden Paul, Alexandra Kollontai, Max Hodann, (who with Dr Ludwig Levy-Lenz performed the world's first sex-change operation in 1931 at Hirschfeld's \"Institut für Sexualwissenschaft\" in Berlin), Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, Ethel Mannin, Harry Benjamin, Peter Schmidt, William J. Robinson (an American contraception crusader) and Jack Flügel, a Freudian psychologist who assisted Norman Haire and Dora Russell organize the Congress and also led the Men's Dress Reform Party. Although not a speaker, Albert Einstein was in contact with the Congress.\nMagnus Hirschfeld, the British physician Havelock Ellis and Swiss psychiatrist Auguste Forel were elected the first presidents of the World League. From 1930, Norman Haire and Dane Jonathan Leunbach replaced the elderly and largely inactive Ellis and Forel, but they remained Honorary Presidents.\nIn 1928 Francis Turville-Petre, British archaeologist and friend of Christopher Isherwood, stayed at Hirschfeld's institute in Weimar Berlin. Whilst based in Berlin, Turville-Petre was an active member of the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, which campaigned for gay legal reform and tolerance, and attended the Second Congress in Copenhagen in 1928.\nIn 1929 Hirschfeld presided over the third international congress held at Wigmore Hall, London. Harley Street sexologist, Norman Haire as secretary and Dora Russell as treasurer, jointly organized the event. Hirschfeld's speech praised British scientists as \"distinguished pioneers in eugenics\". A number of British feminists attended the 1929 conference, including Naomi Mitchison (whose paper was \"Some Comment on the Use of Contraceptives by Intelligent Persons\"), Dora Russell (\"Marriage and Freedom\"), Janet Chance, a pioneer of abortion-law reform (\"A Marriage Education Centre in London\"), Vera Brittain, a writer and pacifist (\"The Failure of Monogamy\") and Stella Browne (\"The Right to Abortion\").\nBy 1930, the League claimed to have 182 individuals as members. It also claimed 190,000 members overall, many of them belonging to affiliated organisations. Groups which constituted portions of its worldwide membership included the German National League for Birth Control and Sexual Hygiene, Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, and the League for the Protection of Motherhood and Sex Reform.\nIn 1932, the fourth international conference of the WLSR was organized and hosted by Hugo Iltis in Brno. Plans for a fifth conference in Moscow were scrubbed because of the political stresses caused by the growing power of Hitler and Stalin.\nMany of the WLSR's books and records were destroyed by the Nazis during a raid in Berlin on the institute in May 1933. The League ceased to exist in 1935."

        "title": "Stabiliser (archery)",
        "text": "In archery, a stabiliser is a general term for various types of weights, usually on rods, mounted on the bow to increase stability i.e. lessen movement on release, thereby increasing precision. Stabilisers help reduce inconsistency in the archer's release by increasing the moment of inertia of the bow. If the shooting technique of the archer were perfect, no stabilisers would be required.\nPrecision comes from repeatability. The reduction of inadvertent movements enhances repeatability. The various types of stabilisers are each designed to minimise a particular direction of movement. These movements are those that may occur between the instant of true aim/string release, and the arrow flying free: not \"follow-through\" and similar activities, which merely indicate what went before. All weight added to the centre section will reduce trembling or shake during the aim, but energy to hold the bow against gravity will obviously increase. Also, the addition of weight will change the shooting characteristics and matching of the arrows to the bow. The successful addition of stabilisers can only be achieved by actual testing and precise groupings.\nAll bodies have inertia, and it is static inertia and non-static inertia that bow-weights \"use\", which means that they resist movement. Consequently, on the application of any force on the bow, e.g. (1) muscular force, whether voluntary or involuntary: (2) the reaction of the bow to the acceleration of the bow limbs, string and arrow: (3) the further reaction of the bow as the string becomes taut and the arrow flies free: the actual physical movement of the bow centre section will be less with the addition of weights than it would have been without. Clearly, the forces acting on the centre section are potentially the same on any shot, and by increasing the static inertia, movement will be reduced.\nPoker stabiliser.\nA long-rod stabiliser holds a weight in front of the bow. It is usually fitted into the centre section in line with the bow arm, or just below the hand position. The addition of this weight moves the centre of gravity of the bow forwards, with two results. \nFirst, \"torque\" effect (sideways twisting of the bow-hand) movement is reduced. At full draw, the string prevents the bow from twisting, but on release, the bow can turn sideways to some degree, directing the arrow to the left or right. But with the forward centre of gravity, the effect is reduced. Similarly, \"topping\" (upwards) or \"heeling\" (downwards) inconsistencies of the bow-hand are reduced. \nSecond, with actual movement of the bow-hand sideways, up, down, or any combination, because the centre of gravity is in front of the hand, the bow will turn in the opposite direction, to correct, to some degree, the archer's error.\nThere is also an effect that does not actually give enhanced accuracy or precision, but there are times when this can still be helpful except in the mind of the archer: the pleasing \"forward roll\" of the bow, as part of the follow-through, with a relaxed bow-hand and forward centre of gravity.\nTwin or limb stabilisers.\nFitted above and below the bow-hand, normally close to where the limbs meet the centre section, these have similar effects to the single long-rod, but also have a third effect. Because of their positioning, the twin weights also resist rotation instigated by a bow-hand error. If this error were not reduced, left or right shots would occur, because the aiming of the arrow takes gravity into account to gauge the trajectory. Consequently, with perfect aim, if the bow rotates on release, the effect will be the same as not holding the bow vertically, i.e. left or right. \nSimilarly to the long-rod, a \"forward roll\" will be induced on release and, in addition, because the twin stabilisers are positioned at the base of the limbs, depending on the rigidity of the mounts, some vibration may be damped, giving a smoother feel to the shot.\nReverse or counterbalance stabilisers.\nFitted usually below the bow-hand on the centre section, because they point back towards the archer, they bring the Center of Gravity backwards. Consequently, they are typically used in conjunction with a long-rod stabiliser, the long-rod having sufficient turning moment to exceed the negative effect of the reverse weights, and so keep the forward roll of the bow on release, this being generally accepted as a desirable feature. Hence, the forward centre of gravity effect will not be as great, but, because the reverse weight or weights are extended horizontally from the vertical centre section, their effect is to reduce vertical turning caused by bow-hand torque. This is, of course, in addition to any long-rod stabiliser anti-torque effect.\nUse and summary.\nConsider the bow as being potentially on a pivot at the pressure point of the bow-hand. If the archer applies inadvertent pressure off centre of the pressure point, then inadvertent movement of the bow will result, with loss of precision. By careful study of the bow's movement, the appropriate positioning and addition of weight(s) may be tried, to reduce errors, although prevention is better than cure.\nFurther, various types of the bow stabilizers have been used, to allow some degree of flexure between the bow and the stabiliser weight. Similarly, the weight may be on an extension rod that may flex in itself. The object of the exercise should be kept in mind, and that object is to reduce bow inadvertent movement. Any flexure will allow some movement of the bow, without similar movement of the weight, hence lessening the weight inertia. However, many archers have found an apparent improvement in their precision with the use of flex / mounts. The weight in hand remains unchanged, and so may contribute to steadiness of aim. Also, the flexing gives a \"rubbery\" feeling, as though the bow wants to remain steady on aim. Consequently, it may be that such effect helps the archer's feeling of confidence on the shot, thereby contributing to precision."

        "title": "1944 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1944 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the second season of the circuit. The AAGPBL expanded in its second year of existence by adding two franchises to the original four-team format. At this point, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes joined the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The number of games in the schedule also increased to 118, while the final Scholarship Series faced first-half winner Kenosha against Milwaukee, second-half champ, in a Best of Seven Series.\nIn that season the ball was decreased in size from 12 inches to 11½ inches. In addition, the base paths were lengthened to 68 feet. As a result, batting averages decreased to low .200 as pitching continued to dominate for second straight season. No batters surpassed the .300 mark, with South Bend's Betsy Jochum collecting the highest average at .296. Once again Kenosha's Helen Nicol led all pitchers in earned run average, turning in a minuscule 0.98 mark, while Minneapolis' Annabelle Lee hurled the first perfect game in league history against Kenosha. Among pitchers who threw no-hitters were Rockford's Carolyn Morris (two) and Mary Pratt, and Kenosha' Elise Harney and Nicol.\nThe final series was extended from three to seven games. The series went to the limit of seven games and Milwaukee clinched the championship, four to three. Despite losing Game 1, Connie Wisniewski earned the four wins to set a series record, pitching a four-hit shutout in decisive Game 7 to give the Chicks the title.\nAlthough the Chicks won the championship, they had no local financial backing and could not compete with the American Association Milwaukee Brewers. In fact, the Chicks were forced to play all seven games of the series at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium because the Brewers were using the Borchert Field in Milwaukee. In addition, the high ticket prices charged for AAGPBL games failed to encourage significant fan support. Due to lack of community support and skepticism of journalists, the Chicks moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan prior to the 1945 season.\nThe AAGPBL drew 260,000 fans during the 1944 season, which represented a 49 percent raise over the previous year."

        "text": "The Carleton Ravens are a collegiate women's ice hockey team based out of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Competing as the women's ice hockey team of Carleton University, the Ravens play in the Quebec Student Sports Federation (RSEQ), as part of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's ice hockey championship. The team plays its home games at the Carleton Ice House, typically on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.\nHistory.\nDuring the 2006-07 regular season, Valerie Charbonneau earned her second straight nod to the RSEQ All-Star Team. Recording 540 saves, she would break the previous single season record of 532, which she set one season earlier. On February 28, 2007, she would log an astounding 53 saves in a 5-4 double overtime victory versus the Ottawa Gee-Gees, resulting in the program's first-ever playoff victory.\nEarning the 2011 Carleton University Most Outstanding Graduating Female Athlete Award, Kristen Marson would play 91 games, setting a program record. In addition, she would graduate as the Ravens all-time leader in career assists with 21.\nIn a January 22, 2012 game against the No. 1-ranked McGill Martlets, the Ravens defeated McGill for the first time in program history via a 4-3 shootout victory. McGill had won 116 of its previous 117 games entering the upset.\nOn February 4, 2012, the Ravens honoured the memory of the late Daron Richardson, daughter of Ottawa Senators assistant coach, Luke Richardson. The club held a charity drive for the Daron Richardson Fund (known as Do It For Daron), a program focused on raising awareness about youth mental health. Bruce MacDonald, Daron's former coach and the father of Ravens player Kristen MacDonald participated in the ceremonial face off.\nOn January 20, 2013, a contest at the Carleton Ice House versus the cross-town rival Ottawa Gee-Gees resulted in a shootout. Ravens forward Jessica O'Grady would record three goals in the shootout, resulting in one of the most remarkable wins in program history.\nIn preparation for the 2013 IIHF Women's World Championship, the Carleton Ice House served as the training facility for the Germany women's national ice hockey team. Former Ravens team captain Sara Seiler served as a member of the German squad. Of note, the Ravens hosted Germany in an exhibition game, which saw the Germans prevail by a 3-0 tally, with goals from Julia Zorn, Franziska Busch, Andrea Lanzl.\nPierre Alain era.\nLongtime Hockey Canada deckhand Pierre Alain was named the new head coach of the program on May 2, 2014. The coach of multiple gold medal-winning national teams, Alain promised a full rebuild of the program from the ground up, starting with recruiting.\nAlain's first season in charge, 2014–15, proved to be a difficult one, as players tried to find chemistry with a strong batch of first-year recruits. Carleton sputtered to a 3-17 record, losing its final ten games in a row to slide out of playoff contention. However, an encouraging set of freshman including goaltender Katelyn Steele, defenceman Robyn Belland, and forward Sidney Weiss leave plenty of room for future optimism around the program.\nCoach Alain's program began the 2015-16 campaign with a roster composed of more than 60% freshman, along with the most first-year heavy opening night lineup in Canada. Freshman Nicole Miners would lead the team in scoring with 10 points. On the final day of the season, Miners would record three assists in a winning effort versus the Ottawa Gee-Gees. Finishing the season with 10 points, she would set a program record for most points in one season by a rookie.\nThe following season, Miners rookie scoring record would be broken. Delaney Ross, from Meadow Lake, Saskatchewan, amassed eight goals and 10 assists for an 18 point campaign. Not only did she set a new Ravens standard for rookie skaters, she would establish a single-season scoring record, also becoming the first player in program history to average one point per game.\nOver Ross' last four games, she recorded six points, on the strength of five assists. In addition, Ross' 18 points tied her with Concordia's Audrey Belzile for the second highest scoring total in U Sports play among rookies, trailing national leader Annie Berg of the Brock Badgers by five points. Earning a spot on the 2016-17 U Sports All-Rookie Team, she became only the second player in program history to receive national recognition. Coincidentally, the other Ravens player to receive national honours also landed on the All-Rookie Team, Kerri Palmer from 2007-08.\nDuring August 2020, former Ravens player and current assistant coach Tawnya Guindon was one of 18 former U Sports student-athletes announced among the inaugural participants of the U SPORTS Female Apprenticeship Coach Program. Funded through Sport Canada, the objective was to increase the number of females in coaching positions across Canadian universities, matching apprentice coaches who have recently graduated with a mentor coach.\nAs the 2020-21 season was shelved due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, the charitable efforts of first-year recruit Emma Weller made national news. Handing out wool hats and mittens, that she sewed herself, to homeless communities around the nation's capital, it caught the attention of The Sports Network, who dispatched a production team to produce a feature of her efforts ahead of Bell Let’s Talk Day.\nExhibition.\n!colspan=12 style=\" \"| Exhibition\nTeam captains.\n\"This is an incomplete list\"\nSara Seiler was the first European in the history of the program to have the captaincy bestowed upon her.\nAwards and honours.\nRSEQ.\nRSEQ All-Stars.\n\"First-Team\"\n\"Second-Team\"\nTeam Awards.\n\"This is an incomplete list\""

Club Banco Nación supported the creation of a team, so the recently created club took its name and colors as a tribute to the institution. Although women take part in many social activities at the club, they are not allowed to vote, so presidents can be elected only by male members."

        "text": "The World Series of Boxing or WSB was an international boxing tournament that allowed amateur boxers to compete professionally while maintaining amateur status and Olympic eligibility. It was organized by AIBA from 2010 to 2018. AIBA confirmed in 2019 that the league had ceased operations amid mounting financial losses.\nHistory.\nThe World Series of Boxing had a precursor in the International Boxing League, a short-lived U.S. venture established in November 1969 after the first U.S.—Soviet boxing dual meet in 1969. The league functioned until 1971 and hosted several exhibition tours of the Soviet boxing team across the United States to cities where IBL teams were located. Bill Daniels was the boss of the league. The league folded due to the unprofitable nature of amateur boxing in North America.\nFormat.\nUnlike in amateur boxing at the start of the World Series of Boxing's existence, competitors fought bare-chested and were not permitted to wear protective headgear. Each participating boxer was drafted by one of its international franchises, and could earn money by taking part in professional-style bouts. The competitors were allowed to maintain Olympic and AIBA world championship eligibility. \nLike professional boxing, each bout was decided by the scores of three judges, or by a knockout, a technical knockout or a walkover. A WSB meet between two international franchises consisted of bouts in ten (formerly five) weight categories. The fights consisted of five three-minute rounds in each bout and the team that won the most number of bouts won the meet.\nWeight classes.\nUntil season 4, the World Series of Boxing had five weight categories which were different from the 10 categories in amateur (Olympic) boxing or 17 categories in professional boxing. These were Heavyweight (91+ kg), Light heavyweight (80–85 kg), Middleweight (68–73 kg), Lightweight (57–61 kg) and Bantamweight (50–54 kg). In the fourth season (2013–14), the number of weight classes was increased to ten, mirroring amateur (Olympic) boxing."

He said that the competition would be important as a last check before the main event of the season – the Olympic Games in London. \"The group is difficult but I am satisfied. The most important thing is to see what are our options before the Olympic Games in London. Of course we all want to attack the first place, it is our debt to the previous generations of Serbian water polo, and those who come,\" said Udovičić at a press conference in Belgrade. Serbia's coach revealed that the \"dolphins\" first training would be on 17 December and that the whole squad would be present except Mikić who still had obligations with his team. From 8 January, they would go on a trip to Greece on a tournament where they would meet with Greece, Montenegro and Spain. Bronze team from the previous championship would travel to Eindhoven on 14 January. Udovičić announced that the team would consist of: Goalkeepers: Slobodan Soro, Gojko Pijetlović, Branislav Mitrović; players: Marko Avramović, Živko Gocić, Vanja Udovičić, Miloš Ćuk, Duško Pijetlović, Slobodan Nikić, Milan Aleksić, Nikola Rađen, Filip Filipović, Andrija Prlainović, Stefan Mitrović, Luka Šaponjić, Dušan Mandić, Nemanja Ubović and Aleks Šaponjić.\nIn Eindhoven on 29 December in a friendly match, Serbia beat Netherlands 15:6 (4:1, 5:1, 3:1, 3:3). Serbian team played very seriously and for a full three quarters absolutely dominated. Goalkeepers shared playing time, with Gojko Pijetlović defending the first two, and Branislav Mitrović other two quarters. Selector Dejan Udovičić decided to rest his most experienced players, goalkeeper Soro, captain Udovičić and Filipović, Gocić and young Ubović. The most efficient in their ranks were Nikola Rađen and Andrija Prlainović hitting the net three times, while Ćuk, Nikić and Aleksić scored two goals. Dušan Mandić and Aleksa Šaponjić debuted, Šaponjić scored a goal. Preparations for the European Championship continued on 2 January 2012.

The debutants were goalkeeper Branislav Mitrović and Aleksa Šaponjić, who played instead of Gojko Pijetlović and Marko Avramović. The squad members were: Slobodan Soro, Aleksa Šaponjić, Živko Gocić, Vanja Udovičić (C), Miloš Ćuk, Duško Pijetlović, Slobodan Nikić, Marko Aleksić, Nikola Rađen, Filip Filipović, Andrija Prlainović, Stefan Mitrović and Branislav Mitrović. Udovičić noted that he chose the best players but that all participants from the preparations were part of the team.\nPreliminary round.\nGroup B\nOn 16 January, Serbia water polo team beat Spain 8:5 (1:0, 2:3, 3:1, 2:1) in a game at the start of the European Championship. The match rivals who played in the finals at the World Championships in Rome, started with great defense and a few attacks on both sides, without much innovation. Hard game made the offense a little sharper, which awarded the \"Fury\" at the start with a five-meter penalty, which keeper Soro prevented from ending in his net. On the other side, the Spaniards were immediately punish for the failure by Duško Pijetović with a majestic goal from about six feet for the lead - 1:0. Spain scored for the first time in the 10th minute of the game managing to beat Soro. After that the Spaniards have caught up with Serbian sleeping defense and have taken the lead - 1:2. Before the end of the first half, at first Stefan Mitrović managed to tie the result, after what Iván Ernesto Pérez, a veteran and perhaps the most famous bower in the last two decades managed to checkmate Soro from minute and a half before the break but that wasn't it. Rađen made the tie with a stunt goal from a distance making it 3:3. In the second half Serbs came back with a two-goal lead. First the captain Udovičić, had three seconds to choose where to shoot and made it fatal for the Fury and in the next attack, Rađen shot a missile and brought a two-goal advantage for the \"dolphins\" - 5:3. Three minutes from the end of the third quarter, Perrone scored to reduce the result. Spain had a chance to tie in the next attack but with not using the player more they were punished by Udovičić who hit the left corner of the goal for 6:4. Slobodan Soro has crowned his excellent game in the last minute of the third quarter, when he defended a five-meter penalty after which captain Udovičić sank a counterattack and scored for 7:4, three and a half minutes remaining. Duško Pijetlović scored in the same way, in the next minute making even a greater advantage. With this victory Serbs sent a clear message: They have arrived for the new title, and even Marc Minguell's beautiful goal didn't brake that impression.\nOn 17 January, Serbian water polo players got the second triumph at the European Championships in Eindhoven. \"The Dolphins' selection won against Germany with a score 13:12 (2:3, 5:2, 4:4, 2:3). Dejan Udovičić's defense didn't stood out in the opening minutes because they allowed the Germans a 2:0 lead after two early ejections for Pijetlović. Serbia was quickly stabilized and equalized the game at 2:2, but the Germans took advantage of the extra player and scored for the final result in the first quarter - 3:2. However, the balance was soon restored to the proper measure. The \"dolphins\" were much more engaged in the attack, including defense, resulting in a two-goal advantage before the break - 7:5. Serbia failed to brake the match in the third quarter and allowed Germany to successfully follow the rhythm of their last seven minutes before the result was 11:9. Goal for goal series continued in the last quarter, which is why the match was uncertain in the final minutes. Pijetlović scored for 13:11, but Bukowski reduced to 13:12 at the last minute for the result. Centers of Serbia marked a good game in attack with Duško Pijetlović scoring four goals and Slobodan Nikić one.\nOn 19 January Serbs defeated the defending European champions Croatia with 12:15 (2:2, 4:6, 3:3, 3:4) in a third-round game and made a decisive step towards direct placement in the semifinals. At first it seemed all sports, Serbs responded after Croats scored three times in a row. Joković - Aleksić, Sukno - Nikić and Sukno - Udovičić were the scorers before the Serbian defense team came on the scene with masterful goalkeeper Soro and counterattacks. First Filipović scored a master lob, after which Prlainović made a precise, quick turnaround for 5:3. After Frano Karač dropped the result with a five-meter penalty, another counter was fatal for the Croats when Udovičić took his team to the lead of 6:4. 32-year-old Karač from Zagreb, reduced the advantage for the second time in a row, but then Stefan Mitrović in a situation with a player more, with a two-meter dribbling pushed the ball into the opponents net for 7:5. Then Udovičić appeared on the scene with a great spin-dribbling and hitting the net for the third time. Tumultuous first half ended with Joković realizing a situation with two players more and making the final score 8:5. In the third quarter, Duško Pijetlović and Miloš Ćuk took the advantage of a player more a rased the result to 10:6. Ivan Buljubašić interrupted a large series of \"dolphins\" with his first goal in a match, after which Sukno managed to score a goal and brake in to a half the \"-4\" backlog. However, Živko Gocić with his precise shot got the three-goal advantage back to his national team. After that, Miho Bošković precisely executed a five-meter penalty. The last quarter didn't go as \"dolphins\" had hoped. In Croats next attack, Mitrović was excluded and Sukno scored his fourth goal for 11:10. Mitrović made amends for his error and in the same minute took advantage of a two men more and knocked the ball into the net for 12:10. \"Dolphins\" new good defense allowed them a good offense, which gave them a new twist and a new goal - a great goal by D.Pijetlović, as well as Ćuk's masterful stroke in the next attack which increased the advantage to 14:10. When it became known who will rejoice, those who wouldn't, they began to rage. Dobud struck Filipović from behind who instantly got the bruising under his eye, but at the very next action he revenged with a hit. The final score was 15:12 for Serbia.\nOn 21 January, Serbia routinely came to the fourth victory at the European Championships in Eindhoven beating Romania 14:5 (3:0, 4:0, 3:1, 4:4). \"Dolphins\" kept one hundred percent due to a great defense, which prevented their eastern neighbors to score in the first two quarters. Filip Filipović and Vanja Udovičić were in the pool despite the many blows they received in the match with Croatia and they successfully led Serbia despite the absence of coach Dejan Udovičić who was suspended. Slobodan Soro was an insurmountable obstacle for Romania and went to half with a score of 7:0. Serbia goalkeeper was beaten for the first time in the 18th minute when Diaconu was alone in front of him but by the end of the third quarter result was 10:1. Serbia players relaxation in the fourth quarter allowed the Romanians to overcome Soro on a few more occasions, but at the end Serbia finished the match with a 14:5 score. The most effective person in the match was Duško Pijetlović with four goals, followed by Prlainović scoring a goal less.\nOn 23 January, in the last round of group A, Serbia lost to Montenegro with 11:7 (3:2, 3:1, 3:4, 2:0). After Slobodan Soro defended Janović's five meter penalty, Serbia goalkeeper raised the confidence at the beginning of the match between his teammates Vanja Udovičić and Živko Gocić who have scored two goals and took the lead with 2:0. However, Montenegro came to the advantage with three goals after the first quarter. Serbia was in a constant disadvantage during the second quarter. With Mlađan and Nikola Janović goals, rivals have increased the result to 5:2. It was clear after Filip Klikovac goal for 6:2, that it would be hard for Serbian's to win but Duško Pijetlović managed to reduce the result at the end of the quarter by scoring in a situation with a player more. In the third quarter, first Prlainović reduced the result to 6:4, but after Filipović failed with a lobe (he hit the crossbar), Ivović on the other side increased the result to 7:4. Then Udovičić hit the crossbar to after which Nikola Janović increased the lead by \"+4\". Aleksić, Gocić and D.Pijetlović found the \"sharks\" net at the end of the quarter, but Mlađan Janović held the advantage of 9:7 with a five-meter penalty. In the last quarter, Serbia had a player more on three occasions, but even then they failed to overcome Šćepanović. The result was 11:7 for Montenegro.\nFinal round.\nOn 27 January Serbia defeated the current world champion, Italy, with 8:12 (5:4, 1:4, 1:3, 1:1) and thus qualified for the finals. This game began with nine goals marking the first eight minutes. Since Slobodan Soro received five goals, coach Dejan Udovičić replaced him before the end of the first quarter with Branislav Mitrović. The goal of young debutant Šaponjić was enough to tie at 5:5. From the 6–6 tie, Serbia water polo players begun to hold a lesson in modern versions of the sport to a team that is the current world champion. It was not revenge for defeat in the final of 2011 Shanghai, it was a simple lesson, which consisted of three phases - solid defense, a wise selection of moves in the attack and forceful implementation. This is exactly what has brought five consecutive goals for Serbia national team, of which the famous rival did not recover.\nOn 29 January Serbia water polo team won its second European title since independence, and \"dolphins\" won the gold by beating Montenegro 9:8 (1:1,2:3,3:1,3:3), paying them back for defeat in the 2008 European Championship finals played in Málaga. Defence was in both teams fare better than the attacks were, offensive actions were often interrupted due to the errors of players who have rushed by the opposing goal, and the goalkeepers on both sides were pointed out. Therefore, it was full seven minutes until the first goal was scored, but whenever someone managed to take the lead, the draw would arrive in the next attack. At one point, \"dolphins\" were left without two teammates who were excluded, but not only they did not hesitated in that situation, but they managed to defend themselves from that difficult situation. About ten seconds later, Aleksić scored from counterattack to give Serbia a lead a hold it until the end. The result was 9:8 for Serbia."

In September 2013 Rhodes received a red card for a stamp on Blue Bulls captain Jono Ross. Coincidentally it was the second time that weekend a player had been expelled for stamping with Nick Wood also being sent off. Citing lack of intent in the action the disciplinary panel only suspended Rhodes for a match. Two years earlier Rhodes had faced harsher discipline after he put Siale Piutau in a headlock and the latter responded with multiple punches. Neither player was disciplined during the game but the panel suspended both for six weeks for their actions. Rhodes helped the provincial Western Province to their 2014 Currie Cup win, to win the trophy for the fourth time. After a stellar year, Rhodes was voted most promising forward at the annual Western Province Awards in 2014.\nRhodes played regularly for Stormers during the 2015 season, helping them finish top of the South African Conference.

Rhodes also started in the 2016–17 Premiership semi-final loss to Exeter Chiefs. Rhodes came off in the semi-final for what would be a long-term shoulder injury. Rhodes was awarded for his hard work and ruthlessness this season by being voted as the Saracens' Players' Player of the Year and being shortlisted for the Premiership Player of the Season.\nRhodes recovered from his shoulder injury in time to start the 2017–18 Premiership Rugby season. Rhodes was however plagued with injuries during this season, with recurring issues with his shoulder following surgery. He came off the bench in both the semi-final and final of the Premiership for Nick Isiekwe. His Saracens side went on to beat Exeter Chiefs for Rhodes to win his second Premiership trophy.\nDuring the 2018–19 Premiership season Rhodes reclaimed his place in the number 6 shirt and was as industrious as ever. On 13 March 2019, Rhodes received a three game ban for dangerous play on Miles Reid during Saracens' 18-9 loss to Bath Rugby. Rhodes returned to the side and was key to the Saracens path to the 2018–19 European Rugby Champions Cup final, including scoring a try in the semi-final win over Munster Rugby.

        "text": "James Roberts (born 3 March 1993) is an Indigenous Australian former professional rugby league footballer who last played as a for the Wests Tigers in the National Rugby League (NRL).\nRoberts had previously played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in two separate spells, as well as the Penrith Panthers, Gold Coast Titans and the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. He has also played at representative level for the Indigenous All Stars, City Origin and in the 2018 State of Origin series for New South Wales.\nBackground.\nRoberts was born in Kempsey, New South Wales, Australia and is of Indigenous Australian descent - from Bundjalung people. He is nicknamed \"Jimmy the Jet\".\nRoberts is the nephew of former player Amos Roberts, the cousin of Gold Coast Titans players Tyrone Roberts, Tyrone Roberts-Davis and Brisbane Broncos player Albert Kelly, Anthony Mundine and former South Sydney Rabbitohs player/captain Greg Inglis.\nEarly career.\nRoberts played junior rugby league for the Ballina Seagulls before signing with the South Sydney Rabbitohs.\nHe played in the Holden Cup from 2010 to 2013 with both South Sydney Rabbitohs and the Penrith Panthers, scoring 35 tries and kicking 17 goals in 32 games for 174 points in his U20s career.\nOn 3 October 2010, Roberts played on the wing in the 2010 NYC Grand Final for the South Sydney Rabbitohs against the New Zealand Warriors and scored a try in the 42-28 loss.\nPlaying career.\n2011.\nIn Round 7 of the 2011 NRL season, Roberts made his NRL debut for the South Sydney Rabbitohs against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs at fullback in the 36-24 loss at ANZ Stadium. In Round 8, his first NRL career try was in the Rabbitohs 31-12 win against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at ANZ Stadium. Roberts finished the season with 10 matches and 5 tries, and was named on the wing in the 2011 NYC Team of the Year.\n2012.\nRoberts did not make any NRL appearances during the 2012 season. However, he did play four games for Souths' feeder club side North Sydney Bears in the NSW Cup. On 25 July, Roberts was immediately released by the Rabbitohs after breaches of his playing contract. On 10 August, he signed a two-year contract with the Penrith Panthers commencing in 2013.\n2013.\nIn Round 11 of the 2013 NRL season, Roberts made his club debut for Penrith Panthers off the interchange bench in their 19-10 win against St. George Illawarra Dragons at Jubilee Oval. In Round 16 against the Dragons, he scored his first club try for Penrith in their 25-10 win at Penrith Stadium. In Round 17 against the Gold Coast Titans, Roberts scored a hat-trick of tries in a man of the match display in a 40-18 win at TIO Stadium in Darwin. On 6 October, Roberts also participated in the 2013 Holden Cup Grand Final against the New Zealand Warriors, contributing two tries to the 42-30 win. He subsequently won the Jack Gibson Medal, awarded to the Man of the Match. Roberts played six matches and scored six tries for Penrith in the 2013 NRL season.\n2014.\nOn 14 March, Roberts was released from the Panthers for off-field misbehaviour and later was \"thrown a lifeline\" when he was signed by the Gold Coast Titans for the 2014 NRL season on 31 March 2014. In Round 14, he made his club debut for the Titans against the Melbourne Storm at centre and scored a try in the 24-20 loss at Cbus Super Stadium.

On 5 June, it was announced that Roberts had re-signed with the Titans on a three-year contract, however it was later discovered that his manager had forged his signature onto the contract, making it null and void. This subsequently lead to Roberts requesting a release from the club. Roberts finished off the season as the Titans leading try-scorer with 16 tries in 24 matches. On 23 December, he signed a 2-year contract with the Brisbane Broncos starting from 2016.\n2016.\nRoberts was named in the emerging New South Wales Blues squad. On 13 February, he played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars, playing at centre in the 12-8 loss at Suncorp Stadium. In Round 1 of the season, Roberts (who was celebrating his 23rd birthday) made his club debut for the Brisbane Broncos against the Parramatta Eels, playing at centre in the 17-4 win at Parramatta Stadium. In Round 4 against the North Queensland Cowboys in the Grand Final rematch, Roberts scored his first club try for the Brisbane Broncos in the 21-20 golden point extra time win at Suncorp Stadium.\nOn 17 August, Roberts was again in trouble over another drunken incident after he allegedly abused a female bartender at the Normanby Hotel. When he was asked to leave by security, he was reportedly acting aggressive towards them and they were forced to put him in a \"sleep hold\" to restrain him until he was unconscious. An ambulance was called but Roberts regained consciousness and allegedly went to another pub to continue drinking for the rest of the night. Roberts received a $20,000 fine from the NRL but escaped suspension, instead being ordered to undergo a wellbeing plan which included community service on his days off for his public nuisance charge. In the Week 1 Elimination Finals match against the Gold Coast Titans, Roberts was placed on report for kicking Ryan Simpkins when he got up from a tackle. Roberts was later found guilty of the contrary conduct charge and was suspended for the do-or-die Week 2 Semi Finals match against the North Queensland Cowboys which the Broncos lost 26-20 in golden point extra time, ending their season. Roberts finished the year with 9 tries in 25 matches. On 30 September, it was reported that Roberts was visiting Thailand with a close family friend and had checked himself into a rehabilitation facility in order to help him overcome multifaceted personal issues, including a battle with alcohol. His manager and uncle stated 'I'm grateful for the support the Broncos have given James, and that everyone at the club cares about him as a person'.\n2017.\nIn January 2017, Roberts allegedly pulled a woman's hair at a Gold Coast Night club and was issued with a drunk diversion notice by police. However, the case was later dismissed. In February, Roberts was selected in the Broncos 2017 NRL Auckland Nines squad. In Round 7, Roberts scored a hat trick of tries for Brisbane in their 24 - 22 win against his former club, the Titans, at Suncorp Stadium. On 27 July 2017, Roberts extended his contract with the Broncos to the end of the 2021 season. In Round 26 against the North Queensland Cowboys, Roberts played his 100th NRL career match, scoring a try in the 20-10 victory at 1300SMILES Stadium. Roberts finished the 2017 NRL season as the Broncos highest tryscorer with 18 tries in 26 matches.\n2018.\nDuring the off-season, Roberts reportedly spent time in a Thailand rehabilitation facility to deal with alcohol and substance abuse. Apparently, he was at the same facility in 2016. After showing good form in the early rounds, Roberts was selected in the New South Wales team for the 2018 State of Origin series. On 6 June 2018, Roberts made his State of Origin debut in Game 1, in which NSW defeated Queensland 22-12 at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Roberts played in all three matches at centre in the Blues 2-1 shield winning series. Roberts finished the 2018 NRL season having played 22 matches and scoring 9 tries for the Broncos.\n2019.\nOn 15 February 2019, Roberts represented the Indigenous All Stars as a centre in their 34 - 14 win against the New Zealand Maori All Stars team at AAMI Park.\nOn 29 May 2019, the Brisbane Broncos announced that Roberts had been granted an immediate release on compassionate grounds. Roberts then signed a contract with the South Sydney Rabbitohs until the end of the 2021 season. This brought him back under the coaching instruction of Wayne Bennett. Bennett had been head coach of the Broncos throughout Roberts’ three full seasons at that club prior to switching to South Sydney in 2019.\nOn 7 June 2019, Roberts played for South Sydney against the Newcastle Knights in round 13 at ANZ Stadium. South Sydney lost 20-12, however Roberts scored a try in the 8th minute.\nIn round 23, Souths defeated Brisbane Broncos by 22 - 20. In the 13th minute, Roberts was put on report and sinbinned for elbowing the head of former teammate Corey Oates. He was suspended for two games, then returned to play in the qualifying final against arch rival the Sydney Roosters.\nOn 27 September 2019, Roberts missed out on playing in Souths' elimination final loss against Canberra Raiders due to a dislocated thumb suffered the weekend previous when Souths defeated Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.\n2020.\nIn round 10 of the 2020 NRL season, Roberts suffered a right pectoral injury in South Sydney's defeat against Newcastle. He was later ruled out for twelve weeks with the injury. On 19 November, Roberts signed a two year deal with the Wests Tigers.\n2021.\nIn round 1 of the 2021 NRL season, he made his debut for Wests Tigers in a 30-12 loss against Canberra.\nIn round 12, Roberts scored two tries in a 34-18 victory over St. George Illawarra.\nOn 28 July, Roberts was fined $7500 and banned for one match after failing to comply with a Queensland Public Health directive. Roberts breached the biosecurity restrictions in place for players in South-East Queensland by going onto the balcony of his hotel room on the Gold Coast.\nRoberts played a total of 11 games for the Wests Tigers in the 2021 NRL season as the club finished 13th and missed the finals.\n2022.\nIn March, a Newcastle fan reportedly spotted Roberts and a Wests Tigers team-mate playing poker machines in a Newcastle hotel at 10pm on the eve of an unsuccessful Tigers match against Newcastle. The drama was described as \"blown out of proportion\". No NRL or club disciplinary action was taken as no integrity rules were breached.\nPersonal life.\nOn 11 October 2023, Roberts was captured on video punching the door of a police van after being led away from a Sydney courthouse. Roberts attended Downing Centre Local Court where he was due to face a mention for an apprehended domestic violence order. It was alleged that Roberts had an outburst in court before he was led out of the building by police. Roberts then punched the door of the police van and screamed \"see what you do to me?\"."

The cups have been conducted by FILA (the UWW predecessor) every year since the 1973 tournament. The World Cup began as a dual-meet competition for the top teams on each continent, but now features the top teams in the rankings of the previous year's world championships.\nTwo individual competitions under the same name were held in 1956 and 1958 before establishing the current World Cup comeptition in 1973. Besides that, the UWW had another competition called the Individual World Cup as a replacement event for the 2020 World Cup Championships."

        "title": "3x3 basketball",
        "text": "3x3 basketball (pronounced \"three-ex-three\") is a variation of basketball played three-a-side, with one backboard and in a half-court setup. According to an ESSEC Business School study commissioned by the International Olympic Committee, 3x3 is the largest urban team sport in the world. This basketball game format is currently being promoted and structured by FIBA, the sport's governing body. Its primary competition is an annual FIBA 3X3 World Tour, comprising a series of Masters and one Final tournament, and awarding six-figure prize money in US dollars. The FIBA 3x3 World Cups for men and women are the highest tournaments for national 3x3 teams. The 3x3 format has been adopted for both the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nHistory.\n3x3 has been a basketball format long played in streets and gyms across the world, albeit in a less formal way. Starting in the late 2000s, 3x3 game rules started to become standardized throughout the United States, most notably through the Gus Macker and Hoop It Up tournament series, which held large events across the country that included teams and players from all skill levels. In 1992, Adidas launched its now-discontinued streetball competition. Since then, the number of 3x3 events and competitions has been steadily growing around the world.\nFIBA took the decision to first test 3x3 at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games in Macau. Further test events were held in April 2008 in the Dominican Republic and October 2008 in Indonesia. The international debut was at the 2009 Asian Youth Games: 19 teams competed in the boys' tournament and 16 teams competed in the girls' tournament. All games were held at Anglican High School in Tanah Merah, Singapore. 3x3 made its worldwide competitive debut at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore. The competition featured 20 teams in both boys' and girls' categories. The competition was held at the Youth Space. Since then, world championships in both open and U18 categories are held regularly.\nFIBA launched a full program to make 3x3 a standalone game with its own format and regular competitions. 3x3 debuted as an Olympic sport at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nThe 3x3 basketball variation has also been used in several tournaments like Spokane Hoopfest, and the Nike 3ON3 Tournament.\nRules.\nFIBA releases from time-to-time a supplement to its official basketball rules specifically for 3x3. The rules state that regular FIBA rules apply to all situations not specifically addressed in the FIBA 3x3 rules. The current set, both in an abbreviated version and longer format, was published in August 2019.\nThe current rules depart from regular full-court basketball in the following ways.\nTeams.\nEach team consists of three players and one substitute. Each team must have three players on the court when the game begins.\nBasketball court and ball.\nThe game is played on a half-court with one basket. The official court is wide (the same as FIBA's standard for the full-court game) by in length (compared to FIBA's standard half-court distance of ), however, the rules specifically state that half of a standard FIBA full court is an acceptable playing area for official competitions. The American NBA &amp; WNBA standard half-court distance is wide &amp; long. The ball is the size of a size 6 basketball () as used in the women's full-court game and its mass is that of the size 7 standard () used in the men's full-court game.\nPossession and overtime.\nA coin toss is held immediately before the game, and the winning team of the coin flip can choose to take possession of the ball at the start of the game, or take the first possession of a potential overtime period. In turn, this means that if the game goes into overtime, the first possession goes to the team that started the game on defense. Game play starts with the defensive team exchanging the ball with the offensive team behind the arc. The game is a single period of 10 minutes with sudden death at 21 points, the winner is the first team to score 21 or the team with the higher score at the end of the 10 minutes. A tie in regulation leads to an untimed overtime period, and in this period, whichever team scores two points wins the game, however, if a game is tied at 20 at the end of regulation, reaching 21 does not end the game. If the defense gains possession of the ball within the arc by a steal, a block, or a rebound, then the team must move the ball behind the arc before being allowed to take a shot.\nScoring.\nEvery successful shot inside the arc is awarded one point, while every successful shot behind the arc (\"downtown\") is awarded two points. The game is a single period of 10 minutes with sudden death at 21 points, the winner is the first team to score 21 or the team with the higher score at the end of the 10 minutes. A tie in regulation leads to an untimed overtime period, and in this period, whichever team scores two points wins the game, however, if a game is tied at 20 at the end of regulation, reaching 21 does not end the game. Game play starts with the defensive team exchanging the ball with the offensive team behind the arc. This exchange is also used to restart the game from any dead ball situation. If a foul is committed that results in the non-fouling team retaining possession — i.e. a technical or \"unsportsmanlike\" foul — the non-fouling team will receive the exchange. In any held-ball situation, the defensive team is granted possession. After a made goal or free throw (except for technical or unsportsmanlike fouls and team fouls 10 or more), play restarts with a player from the non-scoring team taking the ball directly under the basket and then dribbling or passing it to a point behind the arc. The defense is not allowed to play for the ball inside the block/charge semi-circle under the basket.\nFouls, timeouts, and substitutions.\nSubstitutions and timeouts.\nSubstitutions can occur only in a dead-ball situation; a substitute can only enter from behind the end line opposite the basket, and the substitution becomes official once the player leaving the game has made physical contact with the substitute. Each team is allowed one time-out.\nFouls.\nA player who commits two unsportsmanlike fouls is disqualified. Each technical foul counts as 1 team foul, while each unsportsmanlike or disqualifying foul counts as 2 team fouls. Fouls during the act of shooting inside the arc are awarded one free throw, while fouls during the act of shooting behind the arc are awarded two free throws. Team fouls 7, 8 and 9 are awarded two free throws, and all team fouls thereafter are awarded two free throws and possession of the ball. The \"bonus\" rule specifically supersedes the normal rule for fouls in the act of shooting. The un-timed overtime period is considered extension of regulation for purpose of team fouls. Technical fouls result in one free throw, with possession going to the team that was entitled to possession at that time. The first unsportsmanlike foul against a player results in two free throws. Any foul that results in disqualification (either a player's second unsportsmanlike foul or a disqualifying foul) results in two free throws and possession. Offensive fouls, if not technical, unsportsmanlike, or disqualifying, never result in free throws, regardless of the number of team fouls. In the case of a double foul, no free throws are awarded to either team, regardless of team foul count or whether the double fouls were unsportsmanlike. There is a Trent Tucker Rule in which with up to 0.2 seconds left in regulation or shot clock, a high lob or tip-in must be made.\nDevelopment.\nFIBA sees 3x3 as a major vehicle for promotion of the game of basketball throughout the world. FIBA Secretary General and IOC member Patrick Baumann explained: \"The 3x3 concept has all the elements and skills required for basketball, it has inspired and will continue to inspire many great players in the future. At the same time, it is the easiest and one of the most-effective ways to bring youngsters to basketball, keep them and promote our game. Finally FIBA 3x3 can and will promote key educational and social values to the next generations.\"\nFIBA is pursuing a unique click-and-brick strategy to implement 3x3. FIBA has developed a digital community that acts as a repository for all FIBA-endorsed 3x3 events worldwide and offers all players an individual world ranking based on the points earned by players at FIBA-endorsed 3x3 events.\nAny event around the world can become FIBA-endorsed by using FIBA's freeware, EventMaker, to organise the event. All FIBA-endorsed 3x3 events are classified within an established competition hierarchy, thus forming an official competition network. The pinnacle of this competition network is the FIBA 3x3 World Tour, which includes a series of World Tour Masters and one Final. A team can qualify for a World Tour Masters by playing in any of the designated World Tour qualifiers.\nThe North American National Basketball Association (NBA) has also embraced 3x3. Since 2016, the NBA has held a summer series of tournaments known as \"Dew NBA 3X\", where local amateur players from around the US compete in regional events for cash prizes and a finals berth. The men's and women's NBA 3X champions then advance to the USA Basketball national 3x3 championship to potentially represent their country internationally. These tournaments also include live music performances, 3-point shooting contests for fans, an \"NBA 2K\" eSports competition, and appearances from current NBA players. In 2017, entertainer Ice Cube and entertainment executive Jeff Kwatinetz founded BIG3, where former NBA and US college basketball stars compete in a traveling league using rules slightly different from the FIBA rulebook, and also using a ball that meets the specifications for the men's full-court game instead of the FIBA 3x3 ball.\nThe qualification system for the FIBA 3x3 World Cups for men and women differs radically from the system used for FIBA full-court competitions. According to \"The New York Times\", 3x3 has \"an unusual qualifying system designed to grow the sport all year long as much as find the best teams for the World Cup.\" National team entries are based strictly on a country's official 3x3 ranking. The ranking system for national teams also considers individual player rankings. Even a national ranking that would ostensibly qualify a team for the World Cup is not sufficient to gain entry because FIBA currently mandates that the 20 men's and women's teams that participate in a given year's World Cups come from 30 countries, making it more difficult for individual nations to enter both genders into the World Cup. For example, the US women's team qualified for the 2018 World Cup while the men's team did not, even though the men were ranked higher than the women on the cutoff date. Participating in a FIBA-sanctioned 3x3 event can earn ranking points; according to a FIBA executive, \"Andorra has heavy participation every weekend.\" The current concentration of ranking events in Europe makes it more difficult for non-European nations, especially the US, to qualify. The aforementioned FIBA executive, when asked about the prospect of the 2020 Olympic debut of 3x3 potentially lacking any participation from the US, admitted that \"a lot of teams want to beat the US. Beating the US teams is an achievement.\"\nWorld Cups.\nAfter the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, FIBA established a regular World Cup that always includes men and women competing simultaneously in open, U23 and U18 categories. World Cups are played every year, except in years when there are Youth Olympic Games or Olympic Games. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the cancellation of the 2020 event.\nClassification to the World Cup is based on the 3x3 Federation Ranking, which ranks all National Federations based on the 3x3 Individual World Ranking points of their top 100 nationals in the respective category (i.e. men, women, U23 men, U23 women, U18 men, and U18 women).\nInternational games.\n3x3 basketball became a regular European Games contest since its introduction at the 2015 European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nOn June 9, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee announced that 3x3 basketball would be added to the Olympic programme for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, for both men and women.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that 3x3 basketball would be held at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA banned Russian teams and officials from participating in FIBA 3x3 Basketball competitions."

He was selected in the first ever Queensland Maroons state representative side to play the new \"Northern Union\" style of rugby, taking on Albert Baskerville's New Zealand All Golds on their inaugural tour. Baird played as a reserve as the Queenslanders lost the historic match 34–12. He went on to make another appearance against New Zealand and two against New South Wales.\nWhen the New Zealand team came back on the return leg of their tour, they played three Test matches against the first Australian representative sides ever selected. The first Test was played in Sydney on 9 May 1908 with the Kiwis prevailing. On 30 May the 2nd Test was played in Brisbane. The side had four new players who had not played in the Sydney test, two of them Queenslanders in George Watson and Baird. Baird made his sole national representative appearance at full-back, becoming Kangaroo No. 15. Charlie Hedley was selected at fullback for the 1st and 3rd Tests of the series.\nBaird continued to play at fullback for Queensland against a touring New Zealand Māori rugby league team in 1908.\nWar service.\nHe enlisted with the AIF as a Private in the 47th Battalion (Australia) and embarked from Brisbane in May 1916 on \"HMAT A46 Clan Macgillivray\". He was killed on the first day of the First Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium on 12 October 1917. He was one of 3,199 Australian lives lost in the battle."

The team, which plays in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), was led by fourth-year head coach Mark Phelps and played their home games at the Knapp Center.\nPreseason and exhibition.\nRyan Wedel graduated, but returned as graduate assistant. The Bulldogs replaced two-thirds of their coaching staff. Frank Weisler left the team after suffering a career-ending pre-season injury. Brennen Newton is no longer with the team.\nThe Bulldogs were picked to finish 7th in the pre-season MVC poll.\nSeveral players suffered pre-season injuries. Seth VanDeest will redshirt the season along with Reece Uhlenhopp who only played one minute against Indiana State. In addition, Rice &amp; Alexander were suspended for the Bulldog's exhibition and first regular season games due to an off-the-court shoplifting incident. As a result of injuries and suspensions, the Bulldogs played their exhibition game versus Quincy with just five scholarship players.\nRegular season.\nAfter easily defeating Upper Iowa, Drake’s first real test resulted in an impressive win against in-state rival Iowa State. The win significantly raised expectations for the Paradise Jam where the Bulldogs would play Ole Miss, Winthrop, &amp; Virginia. The Bulldogs would lose 2 out those 3 games to finish 6th.\nUpon returning to the Knapp Center over Thanksgiving Weekend, the Bulldogs resumed a streak that began at the end of 2010–11: Win at home, lose on the road. The Bulldogs 12-game home winning streak would be snapped on Jan. 7 against in-state rival Northern Iowa. Following the loss, the Bulldogs went on a 4-game winning streak, the longest in 3 seasons which included two road wins.\nThe week of Jan. 22-Jan. 28 featured what many called the most challenging week of the season. After getting destroyed at Northern Iowa, Drake would put up a nice effort against #15 Creighton but would ultimately fall. The biggest win of the season to date would come Jan. 28 where the Bulldogs won a triple-overtime thriller against Wichita State in a game that lasted over 3 hours. Drake would drop their next contest at Indiana State as a result of poor shooting.\nOn Feb. 2, team Captain Ben Simons was diagnosed with mononucleosis. With Simons out indefinitely, the Bulldogs would score the lowest points in a home game since 1949 in a 57–39 loss against Missouri State on Feb. 4. A loss at Illinois State would be the third consecutive loss for the Bulldogs. The Bulldogs would capture their largest win since Phelps took over as head coach (2008–09 season) at home against Evansville.\nDrake would suffer only its second loss in the annual Bracketbuster contests with a loss against New Mexico State. After winning on senior night, the Bulldogs would fall at Wichita State to close regular season play.\nDrake finished the regular season as part of a 5 way tie for third place in the conference. Unfortuantly Drake's two losses against Missouri State would force Drake into playing a Thursday night game to open the 2012 MVC Tournament.\nPost-season.\nAfter easily defeating Bradley, Drake would face Creighton in the MVC Tournament Semi-Finals. Despite an early 12–3 lead, Creighton would lead at halftime and go on a 15–4 run in the second half. Although the Bulldogs would close the gap to 3 late in the game, Creighton had better free throw shooting at the end of the game to defeat Drake by 7.\nDrake accepted a bid to play in the 2012 CollegeInsiders.com Post-Season Tournament. The Bulldogs defeated North Dakota in the first postseason game at the Knapp Center ever for their first non-MVC Tournament postseason win in 37 years. Drake would fall in the second round to Rice, ending their season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9 | 2012 State Farm MVC Tournament\n!colspan=9| 2012 CIT\nGames listed as MVC-TV broadcast on Fox Sports Midwest, Fox Sports Indiana, Fox Sports Kansas City, Comcast Sportsnet Chicago, ESPN3, and AT&amp;T U-Verse among other local providers."

        "title": "Johnny Smith (rugby union)",
        "text": "John Burns Smith (26 September 1922 – 3 December 1974) was a New Zealand rugby union player, soldier, sportsman and baker. He was an All Black captain, and despite only playing nine matches (including four tests) is recognised as a great. His 26 appearances for the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force rugby team (known as the Kiwis), which toured the UK in 1946–47, earned him high praise. He also played for the New Zealand Māori, being of Ngāpuhi descent.\nAll Black career.\nSmith only played nine matches for the All Blacks, including four tests. His entire All Black career consists of series in or against Australia in 1946, 1947, and 1949. There were no All Black tests in 1948, and the only other opponent New Zealand faced during Smith's time in the All Blacks was South Africa, in a series from which Māori players were excluded.\n1946 Australia tour of New Zealand.\nSmith played the Australians twice during this tour—first as captain of a victorious North Auckland side (32–19), then as a member of the first All Black side since 1938. At Carisbrook in Dunedin, Smith scored a try in a 31–8 test victory. He did not play in the second test two weeks later.\n1947 New Zealand tour of Australia.\nThis nine-match tour was Smith's only trip away with the All Blacks. He made another single test appearance in a two-match test series.\n1949 Australia tour of New Zealand.\nThe All Blacks toured apartheid South Africa in 1949 but Māori players, including Smith, were excluded from the squad. The rugby unions of New Zealand and South Africa, and the South African government, have since apologised for this selection policy which was implemented at the South Africans' request by the NZRFU, \"claiming it did not want to subject them to possible reprisals\". Smith's official All Black profile now attributes his non-selection to \"the unforgivable weakness shown by New Zealand rugby in meeting South Africa's apartheid conditions\".\nWhile that team was away, Australia toured New Zealand, leading to the unusual situation of simultaneous All Black series in different countries. \"The New Zealand Rugby Union ... decided that the 1949 matches against Australia would have full test status, even though the country's top 30 [white] players were in South Africa. One of the reasons for the decision was to not deprive test caps to three of the All Blacks, Johnny Smith, Ben Couch and Vince Bevan who were not considered for the South African tour because they were Maori. All three would surely have otherwise gone to South Africa.\"\nSmith captained the All Black sides that faced Australia. Both tests were lost (including one on 3 September—the same day that the Springboks beat New Zealand in Durban). They were the last All Black matches that Smith played. He was selected to play Australia again in 1952, but withdrew through injury.\nNorth Auckland.\nSmith played 41 matches for North Auckland, his last in 1954. He captained the province regularly, including against Australia (1946) and the British Lions (1950). Against the Lions he nearly scored a try that would have won the game, but was controversially ruled to have knocked the ball on. He was captain later in 1950 when North Auckland won the Ranfurly Shield for the first time, defeating South Canterbury.\nIn 1956, Smith coached North Auckland, and also served as a selector.\nRecognition.\nIn 1949 Smith was the first recipient of the Tom French Cup, awarded to the Māori player of the year.\nThe official All Blacks profile published for Smith states that \"there is little argument that Smith rates among the greatest midfield players ever produced in New Zealand\".\nPosthumous recognition.\nIn 2014, rugby writer Wynne Gray included Smith in his '100 Greatest All Blacks'.\nSmith was recognised as Northland Legend of Sport at the Northland Sports Awards in 2005.\nOther sports.\nSmith's wide-ranging sporting ability led to a national junior tennis title in the 1938-39 doubles (with Allan Burns), appearances for the Northland cricket team, and success as an amateur golfer.\nPersonal and family life.\nHe was born in Kaikohe, New Zealand in 1922. He attended Kaikohe Primary and then Kaikohe District High School. He was one of three children. His father Leslie was a baker who had served in World War I and played rugby for both South Auckland and North Island Country. His mother, Niria Takiwira, belonged to the Te Uri-o-Hua hapū of Ngāpuhi. His brother Peter was also an All Black.\nIn 1946 he married Dorothy Robinson. They had four children, three of whom survived him (along with Dorothy) when he died in 1974. His son Glen won a national swimming title."

        "text": "The 2012 Super League Grand Final was the 15th official Grand Final and conclusive and championship-deciding match of the Super League XVII season. The match was held on Saturday 6 October 2012, at Old Trafford, Manchester, and was contested by English clubs Leeds Rhinos and Warrington Wolves. The 2012 Grand Final was a repeat of the 2012 Challenge Cup Final, in which Warrington beat Leeds 35-18 at Wembley Stadium, although it was Leeds who would win the Super League Grand Final, winning 26-18.\nThe progress of the two teams competing in the match were decided by results in the Super League XVII play-offs.\nBackground.\nRoute to the Final.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nAs in 2011, Leeds Rhinos finished the regular season in 5th place, meaning the team started their play-off campaign in the elimination play-off, where they met West Yorkshire rivals Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, playing in their first play-off campaign at Headingley Carnegie Stadium. Leeds won the game 42-20 with Ben Jones-Bishop scoring a hat-trick and Danny McGuire becoming the all-time leading try-scorer in the Super League history.\nIn the Preliminary Semi Final, Leeds would meet the lowest-placed loser from the Qualification play-off games, Catalans Dragons in the south of France, who they would beat 27-20, thanks to five goals from Kevin Sinfield and a drop goal from McGuire. That result booked Leeds' place in the Qualifying Semi-Final and the club call. Wigan Warriors were the team that were given the decision and chose Leeds. The match at the DW Stadium was won 13-12 by Leeds, despite Wigan scoring more tries (two to Leeds' one). Leeds reached the Grand Final, thanks to the boot of Kevin Sinfield, who kicked four goals, including the conversion to Kallum Watkins' try, and a first-half drop goal.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington's 2012 play-off campaign did not get off to a good start, as they lost 28-6 to St. Helens, despite having home advantage in the Qualifying play-off game following their 2nd place league finish. Tommy Makinson was Saints's most influential player in the game, scoring 16 points from two tries and kicking four goals.\nThe defeat meant Warrington would have to compete in the Preliminary Semi-Final round but would once again play at home at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, this time against Hull FC. Warrington would race into a 24-point lead before winning the 24-12 to reach the Preliminary Semi Final. Following Wigan's club call decision, Warrington were re-united against St Helens, this time at Langtree Park. The reverse of the fixture also meant a reverse of luck for Warrington, who would gain revenge for the defeat earlier in the play-offs by winning 36-18 to reach their ever Grand Final. It also sees coach Tony Smith become the first coach to reach the Super Grand Final with two different clubs, the other club being Warrington's opponent, Leeds Rhinos."

Hazleton competed in the New York–Pennsylvania League of 1923–1937; its successor, the Eastern League (1938); the Interstate League of 1939–1952; and the North Atlantic League of 1946–1950. The team played at Cranberry Ballpark.\nTeam history.\nThe 1929 team was formed June 16 when the Syracuse Stars moved to Hazleton on an emergency basis when their stadium, Star Park, fell down. The Hazleton franchise competed in the New York–Penn League through 1932, was inactive in 1933, then was revived the following season as a NY-PL farm system affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. It would be affiliated with the Phillies (1934–1936), Boston Red Sox (1937–1938), and Brooklyn Dodgers (1950).\nThe 1938 Hazleton Red Sox finished second during the regular season and made it to the finals of the Eastern League playoffs, but drew only 45,000 fans. Boston moved its affiliation to Scranton for 1939 and Hazleton's Eastern League club transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts. Hazleton then fielded teams in lower classification leagues from 1939 to June 12, 1940, and in 1949–1950.\nA professional basketball team took the Hazleton Mountaineers moniker and competed in early incarnations of the Continental Basketball Association between 1946 and 1952."

        "text": "James Thomas McCann (born June 13, 1990) is an American professional baseball catcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, and New York Mets.\nPrior to his professional career, McCann played college baseball at the University of Arkansas. McCann has also competed for the United States national baseball team. In 2019, as a member of the White Sox, he was named to the MLB All-Star Game. McCann has caught two no-hitters in the major leagues: one pitched by Lucas Giolito in 2020 with the White Sox, and one pitched by Tylor Megill, Drew Smith, Joely Rodríguez, Seth Lugo and Edwin Díaz in 2022 with the Mets.\nEarly life.\nMcCann was born on June 13, 1990, in Santa Barbara, California. His mother Carla suffered a torn amniotic sac while she was pregnant with McCann, and she spent the bulk of the pregnancy on bed rest. During that time, she watched local sports, particularly the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). After McCann was born, his mother served as his tee ball coach and drove him to and from Little League Baseball games and tournaments. As a child, McCann was teammates with future MLB All-Star Jeff McNeil.\nAmateur career.\nMcCann attended Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California. He played baseball in the Channel League and was named to the all-league first team in 2006 2007, and 2008. Out of high school, the White Sox drafted McCann in the 31st round of the 2008 MLB draft, but he did not sign, opting to attend college at Arkansas.\nAt Arkansas, McCann played college baseball for the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team in the Southeastern Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I. As a freshman in 2009, he teamed with future big leaguers Dallas Keuchel, Drew Smyly, Mike Bolsinger, Brett Eibner and Andy Wilkins to help the Razorbacks reach the 2009 College World Series. As a team captain in his sophomore season, McCann hit a walk-off home run to beat the #14 LSU Tigers, 4–3, in front of a Baum Stadium record crowd of 11,103. The home run was voted as the third-most memorable moment in Baum Stadium history by Razorbacks fans in 2014.\nIn 2010, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nIn his junior season, McCann had a .306 batting average, six home runs, 14 doubles, 11 stolen bases, 38 runs batted in (RBIs) and 35 runs scored in 61 games played and was named a semifinalist for the Johnny Bench Award, presented to the best catcher in NCAA's Division I.\nAfter the 2011 college baseball season, McCann played for the United States national baseball team in the 2011 Baseball World Cup and the 2011 Pan American Games, winning the silver medal in the latter.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league career (2011–2014).\nThe Tigers selected McCann in the second round, with the 76th overall selection, of the 2011 MLB draft. He was Detroit's first selection of the draft, and the first of four catchers the team selected. He signed with the Tigers and made his professional debut in 2011, playing five games with the Gulf Coast Tigers of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League before being promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps of the Class A Midwest League.\nThe Tigers invited McCann to spring training in 2012. He began the 2012 season with the Lakeland Flying Tigers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, and received a promotion to the Erie SeaWolves of the Class AA Eastern League on June 6, though be batted only .200 for Erie. After adjusting his offensive approach, McCann responded with a .283 average through July 14 of the 2013 season, and appeared in the All-Star Futures Game. He ended the season with a .277 average, eight home runs, 30 doubles, 54 RBIs, and an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of .731.\nMcCann began the 2014 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League. McCann finished the season with the Mud Hens batting .295 with seven home runs, 54 RBIs, and a .770 OPS.\nDetroit Tigers (2014–2018).\n2014–2015.\nOn September 1, 2014, McCann was called up by the Detroit Tigers. He made his MLB debut that day in the bottom of the ninth inning, replacing catcher Alex Avila. McCann got his first MLB start on September 19, 2014, catching for Justin Verlander against the Kansas City Royals. McCann had two hits (both to center field), a stolen base, and scored twice.\nIn spring training in 2015, McCann won the job as the team's backup catcher to Avila. He hit his first major league home run, an inside-the-park home run, on April 29, 2015.

He was invited to his first All-Star Game, where he hit a single in his only plate appearance. He finished the year hitting .273 with 18 home runs and 60 RBIs, all career highs.\nThe White Sox retained McCann for the 2020 season, tendering a $5.4 million one-year contract. On August 25, 2020, McCann was the catcher when Lucas Giolito threw the 19th no-hitter in White Sox history. Overall with the 2020 Chicago White Sox, McCann batted .289 with seven home runs and 15 RBIs in 31 games.\nNew York Mets (2021–2022).\nOn December 15, 2020, McCann signed a four-year, $40.6 million contract with the New York Mets.

He has had a pair of three-hit games with the Orioles, beginning with an 11–7 win over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium on May 2. The other was a 10–3 victory over the Mets at Camden Yards on August 4 when he also drove in a season-high five RBI in his first match against his previous team. He made his first-ever MLB pitching appearance in a scoreless eighth inning of a 10–3 loss to the San Diego Padres at Petco Park on August 15. He got three ground-ball outs around a pair of one-out hits.\nPersonal life.\nMcCann and his wife, Jessica, were married in November 2014. They reside in Nashville, Tennessee. The couple had their first children, a set of twins, in December 2017. He is an avid hunter, including an annual preseason duck hunt along the Mississippi flyway near Carlisle, Arkansas.

        "title": "Mark Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Mark M Davis (born May 18, 1955) is an American businessman and sports franchise owner. He is the controlling owner and managing general partner of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) and the owner of the Las Vegas Aces of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). His father, Al, was the principal owner of the Raiders from 1972 until his death in 2011. Upon his father's death, Davis and his mother, Carol, inherited ownership of the Raiders, with Davis taking over as operating head of the franchise. As of February 2023, his estimated net worth was $1.9 billion.\nEarly years.\nDavis was born on May 18, 1955, in Brooklyn, New York, to Al and Carol Davis. He is a graduate of California State University, Chico.\nPrior to inheriting co-ownership of the team, Davis was involved in the retail part of the Raiders' business where he helped develop their Raider Image stores. He also spent time in the Raiders equipment department where in 1986, he developed the muff-style hand warmer for football. In 1980, Davis represented Raiders player Cliff Branch in contract negotiations with the team which resulted in a deal that included an annuity (active until Branch's death in 2019) and got Mark kicked out of his father's house for being too close to the players. He later lived with Branch when the team moved to Los Angeles.\nProfessional sports.\nOakland / Las Vegas Raiders.\nDavis and his mother, Carol, inherited the team after the death of his father, Al Davis, in 2011. Mark and Carol own a 47 percent share of the Raiders through Al's company, A. D. Football, Inc.; the stake is contractually structured to give them controlling interest. Mark took over his father's old post of managing general partner and became operating head of the franchise. He controls the Raiders' day-to-day operations and represents the Raiders at owners' meetings.\nRelocation to Las Vegas.\nDavis gained control of the team towards the end of the Raiders lease with the Oakland Coliseum, a facility that dates back to 1965 and had multiple issues due to its age. It was also at the time the only facility that still housed both a Major League Baseball and NFL team, a major point of contention for both leagues. As such, Davis put himself in charge of an effort to construct a new stadium for the Raiders, an issue that his father Al was never able to solve in his tenure as owner. He initially stated a desire to keep the Raiders in Oakland (preferably on the Coliseum site) or the immediate area. Due to the lack of a stadium plan, Davis began to communicate with representatives in other cities such as Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Las Vegas.\nIn late February 2015, Davis announced that the Raiders would pursue a shared stadium in Carson, California, with Dean Spanos and the San Diego Chargers. Davis' and Spanos' proposal directly competed with and eventually lost to Rams' owner Stan Kroenke and his proposed stadium in Inglewood.\nUntil after the Carson vote Davis was also actively working towards a resolution in Oakland. In an interview, he said \"we are trying everything possible to get something done in Oakland right on the same exact site we're on right now\". However, after a dispute over rent in Oakland where the city raised the rent on the team after the Carson plan failed and due to lack of what Davis saw as a credible plan from Oakland, Davis began exclusive discussions with Las Vegas. He initially teamed up with Sheldon Adelson to get a stadium in Las Vegas though after funding was acquired for the stadium Adelson was cut out of the deal. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31–1 vote, ensuring them a new stadium in the process.\nLas Vegas Aces.\nOn January 14, 2021, Davis agreed to purchase the Las Vegas Aces of the Women's National Basketball Association from MGM Resorts International. The purchase was approved by the WNBA and NBA on February 12, 2021. Prior to owning the team, Davis had been an Aces' season ticket holder and a frequent attendee at home games. Davis said that discussions to purchase the Aces began shortly after he remarked to MGM Resorts CEO Bill Hornbuckle at a game that the players should get paid more. Prior to making a formal bid, he had a meeting with Aces forward A'ja Wilson to gauge her thoughts about him taking over the team. Shortly after the purchase of the team by Davis, ground was broken on a training facility for the Aces in Henderson next to the Raiders facility. The 50,000 square foot facility which was the first of its kind in the WNBA, opened in April 2023 and houses the Aces’ practice facility, offices, training room, weight room, hydrotherapy space, physical therapy area, locker rooms, a lecture hall, player and alumni lounges, and an on-site day care center. In May 2021, Davis hired former LSU Lady Tigers basketball head coach Nikki Fargas as team president. On December 31, 2021, Becky Hammon was hired as head coach in a deal that made her the highest paid coach in the WNBA. The Aces won the 2022 WNBA Finals in four games, bringing the franchise its first championship, Las Vegas its first professional sports championship, and Davis his first championship as a professional sports owner.\nPhilosophy and management style.\nIn his ownership of the Raiders, Davis has focused on business matters while leaving on-field matters to the football operations staff. This form of management is in stark contrast to his father, who was well known as one of the most hands-on owners in professional sports. Al Davis became general manager of the Raiders in 1966 after returning from a short stint as AFL commissioner, and remained head of football operations after becoming principal owner in 1972. He exercised near-complete control over both business and football matters until his death.\nIn 2013, Mark Davis fired the Raiders public relations director because of a \"Sports Illustrated\" article that was critical of Davis' father. Davis stated that the director's replacement needed to understand the importance of his father's legacy and actively protect it.\nIn his ownership of the Aces, Davis has focused on business matters while also dabbling in team operation matters when necessary.\nOn domestic violence in the NFL.\nDavis spoke out publicly on the issue of domestic violence in the NFL, following San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald's arrest on August 31, 2014. Davis disagreed with Jed York's decision to keep McDonald on the active roster, proposing that the league should suspend with pay any player arrested while \"the investigation moves forward.\" This was the first proposal of this kind following the Ray Rice assault video surfacing, that specifically called for an immediate suspension of players rather than leaving the decision to suspend up to the respective franchises themselves. In March 2015, Davis again went public on the issue of domestic violence, shutting down rumors that the Raiders' started negotiations with Greg Hardy, who was convicted on domestic abuse charges earlier that year. The Raiders' organization has traditionally been vocal about domestic violence issues, with direct involvement with the Tracey Biletnikoff Foundation, created by Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff to support community substance abuse treatment and domestic violence programs.\nOn social justice and player protests.\nDavis has spoken out publicly on the controversial National Anthem protests in the NFL, where players kneel during the playing of the pre-game National Anthem to protest social injustice and police brutality on African Americans. Davis originally preferred his players to stand, but after comments made by President Donald Trump calling protesting players \"Sons of Bitches\" and saying they should be fired for kneeling, Davis changed his stance. In a public statement the following weekend he stated, \"About a year ago before our Tennessee game I met with Derek Carr and Khalil Mack to ask their permission to have Tommie Smith light the torch for my father before the game in Mexico City,\" Davis told ESPN's Paul Gutierrez. \"I explained to them I was asking their permission because I had previously told them that I would prefer that they not protest while in Raiders uniform. And should they have something to say once their uniform was off, I might go up there with them. Over the last year, though,\" Davis continued, \"the streets have gotten hot and there has been a lot of static in the air and recently fuel has been added to the fire. I can no longer ask our team not to say something while they are in a Raider uniform. The only thing I can ask them to do is do it with class. Do it with pride. Not only do we have to tell people there is something wrong, we have to come up with answers. That's the challenge that's in front of us as Americans and as human beings.\"\nIn May 2018, Davis abstained from an NFL owner resolution on the anthem protests that called for players to stand or stay in the locker room until after the anthem is played or face a team fine for kneeling, locking arms, or raising their fist. Davis abstained along with San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York after speaking out on social justice issues to the other owners.\nIn April 2022, Davis stated that he would welcome Colin Kaepernick to the team with open arms if general manager Dave Ziegler and head coach Josh McDaniels wished to sign him stating that he believed in him and that \"he sacrificed a lot of the things that he could've been doing in his life to get a message across about police violence and equity and inclusion in America, and I stand by that.\"\nOn the Washington Commanders workplace conduct investigation.\nDavis has spoken out in favor of a written report of the Washington Commanders workplace conduct investigation, and the release of such a report, in stark contrast to the other NFL team owners who oppose releasing a report, and the NFL announcing a report would not be forthcoming. A year-long independent investigation into the Washington Commanders' workplace culture under owner Daniel Snyder, led by lawyer Beth Wilkinson, was concluded in July 2021 and found that incidents of sexual harassment, bullying, and intimidation were commonplace throughout the organization under his ownership. Davis said that the public and victims deserve a written report. Information leaked from the investigation in October 2021 showed that Raiders head coach Jon Gruden, then employed by ESPN, wrote emails over a 10-year period to then-Washington Commanders president Bruce Allen that included racist, homophobic, and misogynistic language. Gruden resigned as head coach of the Raiders shortly after the emails were leaked to and reported on by the New York Times. Davis has in addition criticised the NFL for not disclosing the Gruden emails to him and the Raider organization when the league discovered them in June 2021, as part of the investigation, so action could have been taken by him and the team before the start of the 2021 season.\nOn player pay and accommodations in the WNBA.\nDavis has spoken out in favor of increased pay and better accommodations for players in the WNBA. In response to criticisms of WNBA player salaries due to a low league salary cap and what is considered sub-standard league accommodations from Aces player Liz Cambage after Davis signed Aces head coach Becky Hammon to the most lucrative head coaching contract in WNBA history worth over $1 million Davis stated \"We have to be paying these women commensurate to what their abilities are and what they're doing. On the front office side and the coaching side, there is no salary cap. Becky Hammon didn't want to be a million-dollar coach. But I wanted her to be a million-dollar coach. Because I thought that she would be, in a sense, when the American Football League started, they had a television contract. And they had Joe Namath. And Joe Namath had the $400,000 contract and he sparked the imagination of everybody that 'This league is real.'\n\"I felt that giving Becky Hammon the million-dollar contract ... would then show everybody that there is value here. Liz Cambage kind of came out with a statement, and I agree 100 percent with what she says. That the players do deserve more money. That they don't need to be flying on commercial flights. ... I agree with all of those things and those are things that the Las Vegas Aces are going to be champions of, and that we're going to grow for the good of everybody in this league.\"\nPersonal life.\nDavis says he is a food connoisseur and has said that his favorite restaurants include Dan Tana's in Los Angeles, California, Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach, Florida, and P.F. Chang's. Davis is known for his signature bowl haircut and for driving a 1997 Dodge Caravan SE which is outfitted with a bubble-top Mark III conversion kit as well as a VCR mounted to the ceiling. \nDavis donated $10,000 to the Gridiron PAC between 2016 and 2017. In June 2022, Davis donated $1 million to the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District to help fortify the schools following the Robb Elementary School shooting after talking to former Raiders player Vann McElroy who lives in Uvalde."

        "text": "The Norwich Cadets women's ice hockey team represents Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont. The school's women's team competes in NCAA Division III women's ice hockey, as part of the New England Hockey Conference (NEHC). Norwich alumna Sophie Leclerc has served as head coach of the program since the 2019–20 season.\nHistory.\nThe 2007–08 season marked the inaugural season of the Norwich Cadets as a varsity team. Mark Bolding was named the program's first head coach and would go on to coach twelve seasons with the Cadets. Sophie Leclerc led the club with 13 goals and 27 points and ranked second for assists, with 14.\nDuring the 2008–09 campaign, the Cadets enjoyed their first-ever ECAC East Conference Tournament championship. In the Cadets final 16 contests, they went 13–2–1, leading up to a 4–0 win over Salve Regina in the conference championship game. Four Cadets players named to the ECAC East All-Tournament team. The Cadets made their first NCAA Tournament appearance before falling to eventual runner-up Elmira 3–2 in the quarterfinals.\nIn the 2010 NCAA Division III Quarterfinals, Sophie Leclerc scored the game-winning goal versus Plattsburgh State with 42 seconds left. She was part of a Cadets team that lost the 2010 NCAA Final to Amherst by a 7–2 tally.\nThe Cadets were led by team captain Sophie Leclerc as the Cadets won their first Division III title in 2011. This was accomplished in only the fourth year of the program. The Cadets set program records in wins (25) and conference victories (17). On January 28, 2011, Julie Fortier notched the 50th goal of her career with a hat trick versus New England College as the Cadets prevailed by a 3–2 tally. In a January 29 contest versus Castleton, she became the second player in program history to record 100 points in a career with a goal in the first period.\nIn the Division III title game, Leclerc contributed with two goals and an assist, as the Cadets defeated the RIT Tigers by a 5–2 mark. Her 54 points led the nation in scoring, while teammate Julie Fortier’s 45 points ranked second nationally (Fortier’s 23 goals tied a career high). Leclerc was featured in the April 4, 2011 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" as part of its Faces in the Crowd section.\nOn December 4, 2011, Julie Fortier became the Cadets all-time goal-scoring leader as the Cadets logged a 5–0 victory over Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Fortier contributed with two goals and a helper. With Norwich leading by a 1–0 tally, Fortier notched the 73rd goal of her career to surpass Sophie Leclerc.\nOn January 6, 2012, team captain Melissa Rundlett became just the third Norwich player in program history to reach 100 career points. She registered a goal and two assists to help the Cadets best Saint Michael's by a 9–0 mark. At the 5:36 mark of the first period, she assisted on Renee Lortie’s goal for the 99th career point. She would reach the milestone by scoring her seventh goal of the season at the 17:09 mark of the first period. Said goal gave Norwich a 5–0 advantage.\nAfter twelve successful seasons, in which he amassed a 266-68-22 record, head coach Mark Bolding stepped down to accept the head coaching position with the Yale Bulldogs women's ice hockey program. The following month, on May 17, 2019, Sophie Leclerc was announced as the second head coach in program history.\nSeason by season record.\nSource: USCHO; NCAA, NEHC"

        "title": "2013 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting",
        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2013 took place according to rules most recently revised in July 2010. As in the past, the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) voted by mail to select from a ballot of recently retired players, with results announced on January 9, 2013. The Pre-Integration Era Committee, the last of three new voting committees established during the July 2010 rules change to replace the more broadly defined Veterans Committee, convened early in December 2012 to select from a ballot of players and non-playing personnel who made their greatest contributions to the sport prior to 1947, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall of Fame.\nFor the first time since 1996, and just the third time since 1960, the BBWAA election resulted in no selections. As the ballot featured numerous strong candidates, the result was widely viewed as a reflection of the deep controversy over players who were primarily active during a period when the sport was riddled with rumored use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), and candidates appeared to have suffered in the voting regardless of whether they had been closely tied to any such rumors. The controversy's first major impact on the Hall of Fame ballot was seen in 2007, and the arrival in future years of additional candidates with either alleged or actual links to PED use suggested that the issue would be significant in Hall voting for at least several more years.\nFor the first time since 1965, there were no living inductees. The induction class of 2013 consisted of the three deceased individuals elected by the new Pre-Integration Era Committee: player Deacon White, umpire Hank O'Day, and executive Jacob Ruppert, all of whom died in the 1930s. As was the case following the 1965 election–which also resulted only in the induction of a member deceased for over 60 years, and led to the resumption of annual BBWAA elections–the voting results led to calls for revision of the voting rules.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 28, 2013, at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. On July 27, the Hall of Fame presented two annual awards for media excellence—its own Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters and the BBWAA's J. G. Taylor Spink Award for writers, and also honored sports medicine pioneer Dr. Frank Jobe and filmmaker Thomas Tull, producer of the 2013 film \"42\".\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA ballot was announced on November 28, 2012. The BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1993 or later, but not after 2007; the ballot included candidates from the 2012 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2007. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote, and had until December 31, 2012, to return their ballots to the Hall.\nThere were 37 candidates on the ballot, 13 who last played from 1993 to 2006 and received at least 5% support in the 2012 election plus 24 first-time candidates (). Voters were instructed to support as many as ten candidates; write-in votes were not permitted.\nResults of the 2013 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 9, live on the MLB Network and streamed on the Hall's website. A total of 569 ballots were cast, with 427 votes required for election. A total of 3,756 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.6 per ballot- the highest per-ballot average since 2003 (also 6.6), and the first average of over six per ballot since 2007 (6.58). The 24 first-time candidates () last played during the 2007 major league season. Eighteen received less than 5% support (*) and were thus eliminated from BBWAA consideration; six newcomers scored 5% support or more, the largest number since 1994.\nNo player received the 75% support needed for election, the first such shutout since 1996 and only the eighth in history.\nDale Murphy was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 29 All-Stars, seven of whom were not on the ballot, representing a total of 104 All-Star selections, a record, and over three times the number of 2012's class (33 All-Star selections among newly eligible candidates); until this year, only the class of 2007 had ever breached 100 selections (103). Among the candidates were 14-time All-Star, 7-time MVP and holder of both the single-season (73) and career (762) home run records Barry Bonds; 12-time All-Star Mike Piazza; 11-time All-Star and 7-time Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens; 7-time All-Stars Craig Biggio and Sammy Sosa; and 6-time All-Stars Sandy Alomar Jr., Kenny Lofton and Curt Schilling. The field included two Rookies of the Year, both catchers (Alomar and Piazza), three MVPs (in addition to Bonds' seven, Clemens and Sosa each won one apiece) and a Cy Young Award winner (Clemens). Bonds and Clemens, with seven apiece, hold the records for MVPs and Cy Young Awards won, respectively. The field included two candidates with at least five Gold Glove Awards: Bonds (seven in left field) and Steve Finley (five in center). It also included five candidates with at least five Silver Slugger Awards: Bonds (twelve in left field), Piazza (ten at catcher), Sosa (six in right field), Biggio (five total- four at second base and one at catcher) and Julio Franco (five total- four at second base and one at DH). Bonds holds the record for Silver Sluggers in the outfield, while Piazza holds the record at catcher.\nAs in recent years, the controversy over use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) dominated the elections. \"ESPN.com\" columnist Jim Caple noted in the days before the announcement of the 2012 results that the PED issue, combined with the BBWAA's limit of 10 votes per ballot, was likely to result in a major backlog in upcoming elections:\nAnother \"ESPN.com\" writer, Tim Kurkjian, added that the 2013 ballot would include several new candidates who either tested positive or were strongly linked to PEDs:\nSeveral other players returning from the 2012 ballot with otherwise strong Hall credentials have been linked to PEDs, among them Mark McGwire (who admitted to long-term steroid use in 2010), Jeff Bagwell (who never tested positive, but was the subject of PED rumors during his career), and Rafael Palmeiro (who tested positive for stanozolol shortly after publicly denying that he had ever used steroids).\nPlayers who were eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Antonio Alfonseca, Tony Batista, Mark Bellhorn, Hector Carrasco, Alberto Castillo, Rhéal Cormier, Juan Encarnación, Robert Fick, Steve Kline, Ricky Ledée, Mike Lieberthal, John Mabry, Tom Martin, Damian Miller, Doug Mirabelli, Mike Myers, Orlando Palmeiro, Neifi Pérez, Desi Relaford, Paul Shuey, Scott Spiezio, Kelly Stinnett, John Thomson, José Valentín, John Wasdin, Rick White, Bob Wickman, Preston Wilson, Jay Witasick, and Jaret Wright.\nPre-integration Committee.\nIn keeping with the new voting procedure by eras, the BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 BBWAA members, identified ten Pre-Integration candidates who were judged to have made their greatest contributions prior to 1947. Along with the era, these rules defined the consideration set:\nHowever, due to the passage of time, the only listed criteria that materially restricted the field from which the candidates were selected were years of service and presence on baseball's ineligible list.\nThe eleven BBWAA-appointed Historical Overview Committee members were Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Bill Madden (\"New York Daily News\"); Ken Nigro (formerly \"The Baltimore Sun\"); Jack O'Connell (BBWAA secretary/treasurer); Tracy Ringolsby (Root Sports Rocky Mountain/MLB.com); Glenn Schwarz (formerly \"San Francisco Chronicle\"); Claire Smith (ESPN); and Mark Whicker (\"Orange County Register\").\nThe Pre-Integration ballot for election by the Pre-integration Committee was released on November 1, 2012, and the Hall of Fame announced the results on December 3.\nThe Pre-Integration Committee's 16-member voting electorate, appointed by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, was announced at the same time as the ballot of 10 candidates:\nThe Pre-Integration Committee which elected three candidates to the Hall of Fame at the 2012 winter meetings in Nashville on December 2–3, with 75% or 12 of 16 votes required for election, convened at the July 28, 2013 induction. Ruppert, O'Day and White were elected. Dahlen received 10 of 16 votes, the highest total of anyone not elected; no one else received more than three votes.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. Through 2010, it was awarded during the main induction ceremony, but is now given the previous day at the Hall of Fame Awards Presentation. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum.\nThe three nominees for the 2013 award were selected by a BBWAA committee and announced on July 10, 2012, at the BBWAA's annual All-Star Game meeting. They were Paul Hagen of MLB.com; Jim Hawkins, formerly of the \"Detroit Free Press\"; and Russell Schneider, formerly of \"The Plain Dealer\" of Cleveland. It was the second consecutive nomination for both Hagen and Schneider.\nFollowing the announcement of the nominees, the entire BBWAA membership voted in fall 2012 to determine the recipient. Under BBWAA rules, the winner was to be announced either during the 2012 World Series or at the 2012 winter meetings; in keeping with the practice of recent years, the announcement was made at the winter meetings.\nOn December 4, Hagen was announced as the recipient, having received 269 of the 421 possible votes (including five blank ballots). Hawkins received 87 votes and Schneider 60. Hagen began his career in 1974 with the \"San Bernardino Sun\", covering the Los Angeles Dodgers. He moved in 1977 to Dallas–Fort Worth, covering the Texas Rangers first for the \"Dallas Times Herald\" and later the \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\". From there, he moved to Philadelphia in 1987, covering the Phillies for the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" before becoming that paper's national baseball columnist in 2002. After a 25-year career at the \"Daily News\", he joined \"MLB.com\" in 2012.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award, honoring excellence in baseball broadcasting, has been presented at the induction ceremonies since 1978. Through 2010, it had been presented at the main induction ceremony, but is now awarded at the Awards Presentation. Recipients are not members of the Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the museum. To be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two. The honor is based on four criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans. The recipient was announced on during the 2012 winter meetings, following a vote by the same committee that selected seven of the finalists (below).\nTen finalists were announced on October 9, 2012. In accord with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a committee composed of the living recipients along with broadcasting historians and columnists. Three were selected from a list of candidates by fan voting at the Hall's Facebook page from August 20 to September 7.\nSix candidates were living when the ballot was announced—the active Doucet, Nadel, Ortega, Shannon, and Staats; and the retired Gordon.\nOn December 5, Cheek, the lead radio play-by-play announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays from the team's establishment in 1977 until his retirement in 2004, was named the recipient. During this tenure he had a 27-year streak of 4,306 consecutive games plus 41 post-season games called, which lasted from the first ever Blue Jays game on April 7, 1977, to June 3, 2004, when he traveled to Salinas, California, for his father's funeral. Cheek was forced to retire shortly after the funeral when he discovered he had a brain tumor, and he died in 2005. The 2013 balloting marked the ninth consecutive year that Cheek had been named among the 10 finalists for the award.\nCheek became the second Frick Award recipient to have worked primarily for a Canadian team, after honoree Dave Van Horne; the award was his third for broadcasting excellence from a sports hall of fame. In 2001, while active with the Blue Jays, he received the Jack Graney Award, given irregularly for excellence in either writing or broadcasting, from the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. Just before his death in 2005, Canada's Sports Hall of Fame created the Tom Cheek Media Leadership Award, with Cheek as its first recipient."

        "text": "Al Rayyan Basketball Team () is a Qatari professional basketball team based in Omm Alafai in the city of Al-Rayyan, Qatar. Al Rayyan is one of the most successful basketball clubs in Qatar, with many domestic and international titles to its name. It is part of the Al Rayyan Sports Club.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1979–1998).\nAl Rayyan Basketball Team participated in the league after the establishment of the Qatar Basketball Federation (QBF) headed by Mr. Nasser Al-Mubarak Al-Ali in 1979. They had to play in outside courts paved with cement as Al-Rayyan Sports Club, or any club for that matter, did not have air-conditioned halls at that time, meaning that the surface area would be very dangerous to play on. At a time while basketball was first being introduced to Qatar, there were only four other clubs competing in the basketball league.\nA report published by QBF in 1982 stated the total number of basketball players in Al-Rayyan in 1970 was \"eight\", with that number gradually decreasing throughout the decade, until 1974, when it was \"three\". They were then coached by Sudanese Abdul Monem Salem. The game started to pick up in the early '80s after the formation of QBF. The playerbase increased, and South Korean coach Young-Suk was selected to bring the team glory. In the '80s, their team was one to be reckoned with, with the likes of Ahmed Mohammed Ali, the top scorer of the division in 1980–81, and Omar Mohammed, the top scorer of the youth division in the same year. Players were laid off in the mid-'80s, rendering the club ineligible to compete in the 1985–86 season. In 1988, the club had once again picked itself up again, with the juniors winning the 1988–89 and 1990–91 seasons. By 1992, the club had more than 95 players.\nGolden era (1994–present).\nThe club was able to achieve its first league trophy in 1994 under the guidance of Colombian Coach Julio Salazar, being Assistant Coach Ahmed Abdul Hadi, Basketball Manager Rashid Tahkrooni and outstanding players Yasin Mahmoud, Abdullah Diab, Ebrahim Basheer, Mohamed Orabi, Khaled Suleman and Abdulaziz Tahkrooni.

The franchise had little to limited success in the GBL and a new team was formed as a part of the new developmental Arizona Winter League in 2007 with the Scorpions joining the Canada Miners and Sonora Pilots assuming new identities and the Scorpions and San Diego Surf Dawgs assuming the former GBL identities. It proved fruitful as the team won three AWL Championships in 2007, 2009 and 2011. Perhaps the most accomplished alumnus of the Scorpions AWL team is Sergio Romo, who was directly acquired by the San Francisco Giants without even playing a GBL game.\nAs for the original franchise, they joined the NAL as a charter member following the merger of the GBL and United League Baseball in 2011 and they have since been purchased from the league by Godfather Media LLC and renamed the Yuma Panthers in February 2012.\nSeason-by-season records.\nArizona Winter League:"

        "text": "Al Rayyan Handball Team () is the handball team of Al Rayyan Sports Club, a multisport club based in Omm Alafai in the city of Al Rayyan, Qatar. It currently competes in the Qatar Handball League (QHL). The team was officially founded in 1978, eleven years after the sports club was founded.\nThe team has previously won the continental championship, the Asian Club League Handball Championship, on one occasion in 2012 and came runners-up in the next edition to Qatari club El Jaish.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nHandball has been played in Al Rayyan Sports Club since 1962, before Al Rayyan was officially founded. In 1978, the team was officially formed, and was then overseen by Tunisian Rachid Hammami on a temporary basis for about a month, before Hassan Abou El Fadl arrived as new head coach. He coached the team for 13 years and lived in the club. Originally, starting a handball team was very difficult in Qatar, as there were no facilities specially designed for it and it was hard to persuade children to join the youth teams as it was a period where football was blooming in popularity. As a result of the lack of experienced handball players in the region, the concept of officially establishing a handball team was originally discouraged by the administrators of the club.\nOver the years, Al Rayyan built a strong team, thanks to then administrator of the club, Ali bin Saeed, who also received assistance from Hassan Abou El Fadl and the team captain, Mousa Reza. Ali bin Saeed, a Kuwaiti, met a childhood friend, Matar Aman, in 1978. Matar, who was in the United Arab Emirates for 15 years, now played handball professionally and was recruited to the club along with his brothers Abdulla and Fahad.\n1978–2000.\nAl Rayyan played their first league game, losing to Al Sadd 15-48 in 1978. Later that year, Al Rayyan won their first domestic title, with Abdulla scoring the winning goal against Al Sadd with 4 seconds left till it went to penalties. They went on to win the league title and their youth team won a domestic cup.\nIn the 1982-83 season, Al Rayyan achieved the impossible by winning all domestic championships in all age groups, which was 9 titles in one season. By then, the first team composed of legends like Youssef Al-Tamimi, Nasser Al-Hamid, and Mohammed al-Maliki. No other team in Qatar has accomplished a domestic triple with all age groups.\nAl Rayyans squad was vastly improved in the mid-1980s. It included the likes of Fahad Aman (one of the Aman brothers), who was considered the best Qatari to ever play in the team, who could play in any position except goalkeeper and had received offers to play in German clubs. In addition, they had the Tunisian Nasser Abbasi, who was the top scorer in Africa and in Al Rayyan.\n2000–present.\nIn 2000, Al Rayyan had won its first international title by defeating Zamalek SC in the Arab Club Handball Championship, a competition where they had finished third-placed the prior year. They were also runners-up in the Asian Club League Handball Championship in 2006.\nThey were eligible to participate in the 2011 IHF Super Globe as the host team. However, they finished the tournament second-last on home soil. They won the 2012 Asian Handball Championship, as well as coming in runners up the very next year to rival Qatari team El Jaish."

        "title": "Golf in Wales",
        "text": "Golf is a popular sport in Wales. Although the sport of golf in Great Britain is most associated with Scotland, where it was established and developed, Wales can record its first courses back to the 1880s, and today has over 200 clubs. The first amateur golf competition was held in 1895, and the first professional championship was in 1904. Wales has produced several players of note, including one player, Ian Woosnam, who has won one of the Men's major golf championships and Wales has twice won the men's World Cup, in 1987 and 2005, respectively. Wales also hosted the Ryder Cup, when it was held at Newport's Celtic Manor Resort in 2010.\nHistory.\nThe sport of golf in Wales traces its origins to the 1880s. The earliest course was constructed in Pontnewydd in Monmouthshire in 1875, but this was a short course. By the mid-1880s nine-hole courses were built at several sites in Wales on coastal common land where the turf was acceptable. Several sites claim to be home to the oldest golf club in Wales, though it is generally accepted that Tenby, formed in 1888, was the first, with evidence that the game was played there from at least 1875. Another early course is found stretching between Borth and Ynyslas being in use from 1885. Other 19th-century courses, again all coastal, include Conwy (1890), Penarth (1890), Porthcawl (1891) and Aberdyfi (1892). The opening of the early railway lines and the growing tourism in Wales gave these new courses opportunities to attract visitors. Though, as the golf clubs of Wales were initially created and run by the middle class, the sport suffered from a view as being English and elitist.\nFrom its early days, Wales has embraced both male and female golfers. The Welsh Golfing Union was formed in 1895, the second oldest in the World behind its Irish counterpart, while the Welsh Ladies' Golf Union was founded in 1904. Wales Golf, which governs the sport in Wales, was founded in 2007 after the merger of the Welsh Ladies Golf Union and the Welsh Golfing Union.\nWelsh golfers.\nDai Rees was one of the first successful Welsh golfers, captaining a winning European Ryder Cup team in 1957. Wales has won the golfing World Cup on two occasions, with the pairing of David Llewellyn and Ian Woosnam lifting the trophy in Hawaii in 1987, and again in 2005, with Stephen Dodd and Bradley Dredge winning in Portugal.\nIan Woosnam is one of Wales' most notable players. Not only winning the 1987 World Cup, he is also the only Welshman to have won a major championship, when he took the 1991 Masters Tournament at Augusta. That year he also reached the number one spot on the Official World Golf Rankings, spending 50 weeks at the top of the rankings, only four golfers have held the title longer. Woosnam then followed countryman Rees' achievement when he led Europe to victory against the USA in the 2006 Ryder Cup.\nWales has supplied seven members of the British and European Ryder cup teams. The first was Bert Hodson, who played for Charles Whitcombe's 1931 team. Hodson played in only one round, losing to an in-form Denny Shute. Dai Rees played in three Ryder Cups, and his captaincy in 1957 was the only time the Americans were beaten between 1933 and 1985. Dave Thomas played in four Ryder Cups between 1959 and 1967, losing only one of his five singles matches. Brian Huggett played in six Ryder Cups and in 1977 was the sides non-player captain, the last time a British and Irish-only team contested the tournament. Woosnam played in eight consecutive teams, and in 2002 Phillip Price memorably beat Phil Mickelson in his singles match. \nJamie Donaldson played in the 2014 Ryder Cup, beating Keegan Bradley 5 &amp; 3 ensuring Europe won the Ryder Cup.\nMeanwhile, Becky Brewerton played at the 2007 and 2009 Solheim Cup. She also finished third at the 2009 Ladies European Tour.\nTournaments in Wales.\nThe first Welsh Amateur Championship in Wales was held in 1895 at Aberdovey Golf Club and then in 1901 the club became the first in Wales to host the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship. The first professional golf championship was in Radyr near Cardiff in 1904 while the first Welsh Ladies' Amateur Championship was played in 1905. A Welsh team first competed in the Women's Home Internationals in 1907. In recent years Wales has held several annual golfing events, notably the Wales Challenge (founded in 2003), Wales Ladies Championship of Europe (1996) and the Wales Seniors Open (2001). Despite the heightened profile of golf in Wales generated by the Ryder Cup in 2010 all three tournaments were scrapped in 2011. The Wales Seniors Open is planned for a return in 2012 at Conwy Golf Course, while it has been announced that the 2014 Senior British Open Championship will be held at Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, the first time the event will be held in Wales. Royal Porthcawl is one of the most notable of Welsh courses and in the past has hosted the 1995 Walker Cup, The Amateur Championship on six occasions and the Wales Ladies Championship.\nThe Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, South Wales was the venue for the 2010 Ryder Cup; the first time the event was held in Wales. Europe beat the US by 14½ points to 13½ in one of the most dramatic finishes to the tournament in recent years. The event also made history by becoming the first Ryder Cup to stretch over four days, following heavy rain throughout the weekend.\nCourses.\nWales is home to roughly 200 golf courses. The first appeared in the late 19th century, mainly links courses, most notably at Aberdyfi, Borth and Ynyslas, Conwy, Penarth, Porthcawl, St David's and Tenby. Cardiff's first club was at Radyr (1902), while other courses in Wales to appear that decade include those at Old Colwyn, Brecon and Porthmadog. Courses continued to appear in Wales throughout the early 20th century, including 14 designed by James Braid. In 1908, St David's Golf Club was granted Royal patronage by King Edward VII, becoming the first Welsh club to be granted the honour. Porthcawl became the second and last club in Wales to receive the title the following year."

        "text": "Russia competed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, from 7 to 23 February 2014 as the host nation. As host, Russia participated in all 15 sports, with a team consisting of 232 athletes. It is Russia's largest Winter Olympics team to date.\nIn preparation for the Games Russian Olympic Committee naturalized a South Korean-born short-track speed-skater Ahn Hyun-soo and an American-born snowboarder Vic Wild. They won a total of 5 golds and 1 bronze in Sochi.\nRussia's medal count in 2014, 33 (before doping disqualifications), was its highest ever in the Winter Olympics, improving on the 1994 Games, when the Russian team earned 23 medals overall, also beating the Soviet Union's best medal count ever at the Winter Olympics.\nBobsledder Aleksandr Zubkov was the flag bearer of the Russian team in the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony.\nFollowing the Games, it was discovered that Russia's performance has been aided by a wider state-sponsored doping program. On December 9, 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up.\nAt the end of 2017, IOC disqualified 43 Russian athletes and stripped Russia from 13 Sochi medals, but Court of Arbitration for Sport nullified 28 out of 43 disqualifications citing insufficient evidence and returned 9 out of 13 medals. In particular, on November 1, 2017, cross-country skiers Evgeniy Belov and gold and silver medalist Alexander Legkov became the first athletes to be disqualified for doping violations after an investigation was completed. Four more were disqualified on November 9, 2017, when Maksim Vylegzhanin, Evgenia Shapovalova, Alexei Petukhov, and Julia Ivanova were sanctioned. The total was brought to ten when gold medalist Aleksandr Tretyakov and bronze medalist Elena Nikitina were banned along with Maria Orlova and Olga Potylitsina who were all skeleton racers. On November 24, 2017, the IOC imposed life bans on bobsledder Alexandr Zubkov and speed skater Olga Fatkulina who won a combined of 3 medals (2 gold, 1 silver). All their results were disqualified, meaning that Russia lost its first place in the medal standings. On November 27, 2017, IOC disqualified Olga Vilukhina, Yana Romanova, Sergey Chudinov, Alexey Negodaylo, and Dmitry Trunenkov, and stripped Vilyukhina and Romanova of their medals in biathlon. Three athletes who didn't win medals (Alexander Kasjanov, Ilvir Huzin, Aleksei Pushkarev) were sanctioned on November 29, 2017. Biathlete Olga Zaitseva who won silver in a relay was disqualified on December 1, 2017. Two other athletes, Anastasia Dotsenko and Yuliya Chekalyova, were also banned. On December 12, 2017, six Russian ice hockey players were disqualified. On 18 December 2017 the IOC imposed a life ban on bobsledder Alexey Voyevoda. Eleven athletes were disqualified on December 22, 2017. Among them, silver medalists Albert Demchenko and Tatiana Ivanova who were stripped of their medals in luge.

Yulia Lipnitskaya, at 15, became the youngest Russian Winter Olympic medalist, while Adelina Sotnikova won the first ever Russian ladies figure skating gold medal.\nFreestyle skiing.\nRussia qualified a maximum of 26 athletes (14 women and 12 men). Among them, Maria Komissarova had qualified to compete, but was seriously injured at the start of the Games during training, in a fall that left her paralysed below the waist.\nIce hockey.\nAs hosts, Russia automatically qualified a women's team. The men's team qualified as being one of the 9 highest ranked teams in the IIHF World Ranking following the 2012 World Championships (and would have qualified automatically as hosts if it didn't qualify through rankings).\nWomen's tournament.\nOn December 12, 2017, six Russian players were disqualified for doping violations and all results of the team were annulled. Tatiana Burina and Anna Shukina were also disqualified ten days later.\nLuge.\nEarning automatic places as a host nation, Russia has qualified a maximum of 10 spots (7 men, 3 women, and a relay team).\nShort track speed skating.\nAs hosts, Russia have been given the maximum 5 men and 5 women to compete. On 10 February 2014, Viktor Ahn won the bronze medal in the 1500 m short track speedskating event. He won the first short track speedskating medal that Russia has earned while competing as Russia. On 15 February 2014, Ahn won the first Russian gold medal in short track at the 1000 m event, leading the first Russian 1-2 finish in short track, with Vladimir Grigorev winning silver. At 31 years and 191 days, Grigorev also became the oldest man to win a short track Olympic medal, with that silver. On 21 February 2014, he won the gold in the 5000 m relay, upping the oldest shorttrack male athlete record for both medals and gold medals.\nSkeleton.\nRussia qualified a maximum of 6 athletes (3 men and 3 women).\nSki jumping.\nRussia has qualified a total of six athletes (five men and one woman)\nSnowboarding.\nRussia qualified a total of 15 athletes (11 men and 4 women).

Alena Zavarzina won a bronze medal in giant parallel slalom.\nSpeed skating.\nBased on the results from the fall World Cups during the 2013–14 ISU Speed Skating World Cup season, Russia earned the following start quotas:\n Russia earned the max quotas (ten women and ten men) for speed skating, but only eight women competed. Viktoriya Filyushkina was a reserve for ladies' 3000 meter and Lada Zadonskaya was a reserve for ladies' 5000 meter. Both women qualified and were included in the Russian speed skating squad but did not get to compete by the decision of the Russian speed skating federation.\nDoping scandal after Olympics.\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, Russia's track and field team was provisionally suspended by the IAAF.\nIn May 2016, \"The New York Times\" published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping.\nIn December, 2016, following the release of the McLaren report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. Italian newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. The Russian team potentially could be stripped of up to 12 Olympic medals.\nThree ladies artistic skaters were named as being under investigation. They are Adelina Sotnikova, the singles gold medalist, as well as pairs skaters Tatiana Volosozhar and Ksenia Stolbova. Volosozhar and Stolbova won gold and silver medals, respectively, in pairs skating. Both also won gold medals in the team event, which also puts the other eight team medalists at risk of losing their golds.\nSix skiers were suspended from competition on the basis of the McLaren report: Evgeniy Belov, Alexander Legkov, Alexey Petukhov, Maxim Vylegzhanin, Yulia Ivanova, and Yevgeniya Shapovalova. Legkov won a gold medal, and Vylegzhanin won three silver medals.\nThe International Biathlon Union suspended two biathletes who were in the Sochi games: Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova, according to \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". Vilukhina won silver in sprint, and both women were on a relay team that won the silver medal.\nThe International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation suspended four skeleton sliders. They are among the six athletes on the skeleton team: Nikita Tregubov, Alexander Tretyakov, Elena Nikitina, Maria Orlova, and Olga Potylitsina. Tretyakov won a gold medal, and Nikitina won a bronze."

She signed a one-year contract with the Capitals to play for them during the 2011/2012 season.

This was the first real opportunity the team's coaches had to see her play with the team. In an October 2011 game for the Capitals, she scored 11 points against the Rangers. In a December 2011 game against the Bulleen Boomers, she fouled out.\nSEABL.\nLewis played for a Launceston Tornadoes team in the SEABL with Capitals teammate Nicole Hunt in 2011.

He made 15 appearances for the Queensland state team from 1930 being the period of the revival of the code in Queensland, following its dormancy since World War I.\nRugby career.\nClark was born in Mount Perry near Bundaberg, Queensland and attended St Joseph's College, Gregory Terrace.\nHe made his state representative debut for Queensland against a visiting British side in 1930. The following year he was picked in the national team to tour to New Zealand as vice-captain to Syd Malcolm. He played in seven of the tour's ten matches including two Tests. One of these Tests was against a New Zealand Māori rugby union team and Clark captained the side. It was a mid-week tour match at the time, but was decreed in 1986 as a Test match by the Australian Rugby Union. Accordingly, Clark posthumously earned the honour of being a Wallaby Test captain. His brother Phil Clark was also on that tour.\nIn 1932 he played in two domestic Test matches when New Zealand toured Australia. The following year he was selected for the first-ever Wallaby tour of South Africa. He played in one Test on tour and in eight other minor matches with injury restricting his game time on the tour."

        "text": "The individual show jumping event, part of the equestrian program at the 2000 Summer Olympics, was held from 25 September to 1 October 2000 at the Sydney International Equestrian Centre 45 miles outside of Sydney, Australia. Like all other equestrian events, the jumping competition was mixed gender, with both male and female athletes competing in the same division. There were 74 competitors from 28 nations. Each nation could have up to 4 riders. The event resulted in a three-way tie for first and a medal jump-off. Dutch riders Jeroen Dubbeldam and Albert Voorn finished first and second in that jump-off, earning the Netherlands' first gold medal and second silver medal in individual jumping. Khaled Al Eid earned Saudi Arabia's first medal in the event with his bronze, finishing third in the jump-off.\nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nSeven of the top 10 riders from the 1996 Games returned: silver medalist Wilhelm Melliger of Switzerland, bronze medalist Alexandra Ledermann of France, sixth-place finisher Geoff Billington of Great Britain, seventh-place finisher Jan Tops of the Netherlands (who had also finished in the top 10 in 1988 and 1992), eighth-place finisher Álvaro de Miranda Neto of Brazil, and ninth-place finishers Rodrigo de Paula Pessoa of Brazil and John Whitaker of Great Britain. 1992 Olympic gold medalist Ludger Beerbaum of Germany also returned. Pessoa was also the reigning World Champion and had finished in the top 10 at the 1992 Games; he was the favorite in Sydney.\nIran and Jordan each made their debut in the event. France competed for the 19th time, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition used the five-round format introduced in 1992, with three rounds in the qualifying round and two rounds in the final. The one significant change from the previous Games was that the number of pairs advancing to the final increased from 25 to 45 but a mid-final cut was reintroduced, with only 20 pairs competing in the second half of the final.\nFor the qualifying round, each pair competed in three rounds. The total score across all three rounds counted for advancement to the individual final; the second and third rounds counted towards the team score. The individual competition allowed 45 pairs to advance to the final, though only three pairs per nation were allowed.\nIn the final, there were two rounds. All of the finalists competed in the first, but only the top 20 pairs competed again in the second round. The combined score for the two rounds was the result for those pairs. A jump-off would be used if necessary to break ties for medal positions; other ties would not be broken.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nRound 1.\nHeld Monday, 25 September 2000. The two riders who were eliminated during the round automatically received a score 20 points higher than the highest other score and continued to compete in the second round.\nRound 2.\nThe second qualifying round was also the first team round. Held Thursday, 28 September 2000.\nRound 3.\nThe third individual qualifier was also the second team round. All athletes competed individually regardless of their team's qualification. 45 pairs advanced to the final round. Only three pairs from any single NOC could advance. This led to four pairs being eliminated. Held Thursday, 28 September 2000.\nFinal round.\nRound A.\nAll scores were reset to zero after the third qualifying round. Held Sunday, 1 October 2000. The top 20 riders and ties advanced to Round B of the finals.\nRound B.\nThe 12-way tie for 20th-place resulted in 31 pairs advancing to the second round of the final. A jump-off was required to break the ties for the medals."

        "text": "The All-Pac-12 men's basketball team is an annual Pac-12 Conference honor bestowed on the best players in the conference following every college basketball season. Pac-12 coaches select a 10-player first team and a five-player second team. There were two five-man teams from 1956 though 1979, followed by one 10-man first team from 1980 through 2008. For one year in 2008, there were three five-man teams selected.\nDuring the final week of the regular season, Pac-12 coaches nominate up to three players from their team to be placed on the ballot for consideration. Coaches submit their votes by the Sunday after the season ends and cannot vote for their own players. Previously, a player needed to be selected on 50 percent of the ballots to be on the team. In the 2006–07 season, only nine players received enough votes to be selected. Ties resulted in extra players being selected in some seasons. Each team member receives an award. Players who are not placed on the first or second teams, but received at least three votes, earn honorable mention. The Pac-12 staff has the right to add to the list of recipients selected by the coaches for recognition.\nThe Pac-12, as currently chartered, was formed in 1959. However, the league claims the history of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), founded in 1915, as its own. After the collapse of the PCC in 1959, five of its members immediately founded the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU). By 1964, all of the final PCC members except Idaho were reunited in the AAWU. The AAWU unofficially used the names Big Five, Big Six, and Pacific-8 before formally adopting the \"Pacific-8\" name in 1968. The name changed to Pacific-10 when Arizona and Arizona State joined in 1978, and to Pac-12 when Colorado and Utah joined in 2011.\nSelections per School.\nFirst Team.\nFrom 1943−1955 they selected teams for North/South Divisions.&lt;br&gt;Starting in the 1979–80 season,&lt;br&gt; 10 players for first team.\nSecond Team.\nThe Pac-10/12 started Second team All Conference in the 1955−56 season.\nThird Team.\nThe Pac-10/12 only had third team All Conference during 2007−08."

Kim and her partner Ha Jung-eun played against Indonesia's Meiliana Jauhari and Greysia Polii. It is suspected that the Koreans emulated China so to avoid playing against another Korean team in the semi-finals; the Korean head coach Sung Han-kook said \"Because they don't want to play the semi-final against each other, so we did the same.

        "title": "King Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse",
        "text": "The King Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse, formerly known as the Waikapu Valley Country Club, is a building in Waikapu, Maui, Hawaii. The structure is based on the unbuilt Arthur Miller house (1957) originally conceived by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959). Wright designed the house for Arthur Miller's wife, Marilyn Monroe (1926–1962), but Miller and Monroe divorced soon after and the project was abandoned. The Arthur Miller house design was a modification of two previous unbuilt projects—the Raúl Baillères house (1952) and before it, the Robert F. Windfohr house (1949), also known as the \"Crownfield\" house.\nWright's work remained in the Taliesin archives for more than two decades until 1988 when Pundy Yokouchi and Howard Hamamoto visited Taliesin Architects in Scottsdale, Arizona, and expressed interest in building a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed golf clubhouse. Architect John Rattenbury combined all three unfinished Wright designs, enlarged them to meet the spatial requirements of a commercial clubhouse, and designed it to fit into the natural landscape of Waikapu's hilly terrain. Construction of the clubhouse was completed in 1993.\nLocated at an elevation of 750 feet in the foothills of the West Maui Mountains, the clubhouse looks out across the sugarcane-filled valley of Central Maui's isthmus towards the Upcountry slopes of the Haleakalā volcano in the east, with panoramic coastal views of Ma'alaea Bay in the south and Ho‘okipa Bay in the north.\nHistory.\nIn February 1949, Robert F. Windfohr and his wife Anne Valliant Burnett Tandy asked architect Frank Lloyd Wright to design a luxury home for them on the prairie of Fort Worth, Texas. Calling it \"Crownfield\", Wright designed it in a short period of time, and the Windfohr's discussed modifications, but the project never went anywhere.The Crownfield design was altered in 1952 for Mexican government official Raúl Baillères who planned to build the home in Acapulco, Mexico. Nothing came of the project. Then, in 1957, Marilyn Monroe contacted Wright about building a home for her and her husband Arthur Miller in Roxbury, Connecticut. Wright expanded the original plans for Crownfield, complete with movie theater, pool, and nursery for the children Miller and Monroe planned to have. But the marriage did not last and Wright died shortly after, leaving the unfinished plans archived at Taliesin West.\nIn 1984, businessman Sandy Sims first contacted the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona, and proposed a Golf course development and subdivision using unbuilt designs from Wright's archives to construct Wright-designed residences on the course. Developers Pundy Yokouchi and Howard Hamamoto contacted Taliesin Architects and requested an original Frank Lloyd Wright design for a golf clubhouse in Waikapu, Maui, Hawaii. Architect John Rattenbury combined all three designs to produce a new structure that fit into the Waikapu landscape. Due to a period of drought on Maui, the second stage of the project involving a subdivision composed of 30 Wright-designed homes was put on hold and was never built. Lead developer Takeshi Sekiguchi and builder Hawaiian Dredging Construction Company constructed the clubhouse from concrete and steel, completing the project in 1993.\nFeatures.\nThe building is split into three levels with two-thirds of the structure underground, with a total area of 74,778 square feet. Copper fascia surrounds the domed roofs of the building which fits into the landscape of the West Maui Mountains behind it and the golf course bunkers in front.\nThe upper level has an area of 20,421 square feet. It includes the lobby, pro shop, meeting rooms, dining room, and kitchen. There are three banquet meeting rooms. The dining room features a 100-foot dome roof with a central 25 foot skylight. At 3,800 sq. feet, the pro shop is the largest in the state of Hawaii. The mid level of the building has an area of 26,741 square feet. The lower level has an area of 27,616 square feet and contains locker rooms for men and women, Japanese baths, golf cart parking and maintenance facilities.\nThe main stairwell sits beneath a stained glass sky panel based on Wright's original butterfly art glass design over the entrance of the Dana–Thomas House in Springfield, Illinois.\nEndemic nene (\"Branta sandvicensis\") geese live on the grounds. Native plants in the area include ʻilima (\"Sida fallax\") and 'akia (\"Wikstroemia foetida\"). Common tropical trees and plants on the grounds include plumeria, hibiscus, Cook pine (\"Araucaria columnaris\"), monkeypod (\"Albizia saman\"), and Bougainvillea.\nOwnership.\nThe clubhouse was originally owned by the Waikapu Valley Country Club, and later, the Grand Waikapu Golf Resort and Spa which changed ownership and closed in 1999. During this time, the clubhouse remained open and was used for special events. In 2004, Makoto Kaneko purchased the business for $12.5 million and invested $40 million in restoring the property. It re-opened in 2006 as the King Kamehameha Golf Course Clubhouse.\nArt collection.\nThe clubhouse contains an extensive collection of artwork honoring the culture of Hawaii, including a painting by Herb Kawainui Kāne, featherwork by Jo-Anne Kahanamoku-Sterling, kapa by Puanani Van Dorpe, bronze sculptures by Dale Zarella, and a portrait by Tonia Marks Baney.\nPopular culture.\nThe golf course served the location as the Finish Line for the 14th season of the 2009 American reality television program \"The Amazing Race\"."

It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932; the time trial had been re-introduced in 1996 alongside the road race\nSamuel Sánchez of Spain would have been the defending champion, but due to an injury incurred at the 2012 Tour de France he could not compete.\nThe race was won by Kazakhstan's Alexander Vinokourov. He sprinted clear of Colombia's Rigoberto Urán, who claimed the silver medal. Alexander Kristoff of Norway won the sprint from the following group to take bronze. Vinokourov was the first man (and, through the 2016 Games, only; multiple women have done so) to win multiple medals in the event; he had previously taken silver in 2000.\nQualification.\nThe top ten ranked countries in the final standings of the 2011 UCI World Tour qualified to have five riders to represent their respective country in the race. The nations with five-man squads were: Spain, Belgium, Italy, Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Netherlands, United States and Switzerland; although Luxembourg placed ninth in the rankings, their roster was reduced to two men. Of the other nations on the World Tour, France and Denmark had four riders, Norway and Ireland three, Kazakhstan two and Slovakia, Costa Rica and Latvia one rider each. The top six countries on the UCI Europe Tour – Slovenia, Russia, Portugal, Poland, Turkey and Belarus – in addition to Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, the UCI America Tour top three, UCI Asia Tour leaders Iran and UCI Africa Tour leaders Morocco, had three riders. The remaining nations in the race were represented by either two or one rider. Eritrea, Georgia, and Syria competed in the event for the first time. There were a total of 144 participants.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe Belfast Telegraph columnist \"The Punter\" considered the 2011 World Road Race champion, Mark Cavendish of Great Britain to be the favourite for the race, although his chances were likely dependent on whether the race ended in a sprint finish. Cavendish was expected to be greatly assisted by his four-man British team which he labelled his 'dream team' prior to the race and regarded by Bradley Wiggins as 'possibly the strongest fielded in an Olympic road race'. The race did not go as planned as Ian Stannard, David Millar, Chris Froome, and Wiggins all finished beyond 90th place and Cavendish came across in 29th.\nTom Boonen of Belgium, Australia's Matthew Goss, André Greipel of Germany were also tipped as potential winners. \nOther sprinters tipped for Medals included Tour de France points classification winner Peter Sagan of Slovakia and Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway – but both riders had perceived weaker teams than those of Great Britain, Belgium and Germany. If the race was to have ended in a sprint finish, Sagan and Boonen were tipped for victory, along with other classic specialists such as Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, the silver medalist in 2008, and Philippe Gilbert of Belgium.\nThe defending champion, Samuel Sánchez of Spain, did not enter the race due to an injury suffered at the 2012 Tour de France.\nCourse.\nThe race was long and began with a mass start. Crowds were bolstered by free entry for 150 km of the 250 km route, recent British success in the 2012 Tour de France and the possibility of the host nation winning its first gold medal of the 2012 Olympics through Mark Cavendish. Originally 3,500 paid tickets were made available for the grandstand area on Box Hill where the cyclists would undertake nine laps, but due to demand this was increased to 15,000 tickets.\nResults.\nThe entry list was published on 23 July.\nIn the table below, \"s.t.\" indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the cyclist before him, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time."

        "text": "Tyler Michael Moore (born January 30, 1987) is an American former professional baseball left fielder and first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals and Miami Marlins.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Nationals.\nMoore was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the 16th round of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft out of the Mississippi State University. Moore was drafted two times previously, both by the Nationals.\nHe was assigned to Low-A Vermont that season, where he had a .200 batting average in 71 games with the club. He struck out 66 times, compared to only 13 walks. He only hit 6 home runs, despite the high K/BB ratio. He still earned a promotion for the next season, 2009, playing with Single-A Hagerstown. He played in 111 games with a .297 batting average, his highest to date. He struck out an average of once a game, and had 87 RBI. His improved K/BB ratio earned him a promotion, this time to Double-A Harrisburg. 2010 was his breakout season, playing in 129 games with a .269 average. He didn't decrease his K/BB ratio, but he did hit 31 home runs as a response. He also had 111 RBI and an .873 OPS. This earned him the Nationals' 2010 Minor League Player of the Year. He played 2011 with Triple-A Syracuse, where he hit .270 in 137 games. He had 31 home runs again, but his RBI total decreased, and his K/BB ratio increased.\nMoore was added to the Nationals' 40 man roster on November 18, 2011. On April 29, 2012, Moore was recalled to Washington when Mark DeRosa was placed on the 15-day DL. Moore was hitting .286 with 7 HR and 20 RBI in 22 games with Triple-A Syracuse. On June 13, 2012, during a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Tyler Moore hit his first two home runs of his Major League career and 5 RBI. He finished his rookie campaign batting .263/.327/.513 with 10 home runs and 29 RBI in 75 appearances.\nIn 2013, Moore played in 63 games for the big league club, posting a slash of .222/.260/.347 with 4 home runs and 21 RBI. The following year, he played in 42 games for Washington, and matched his previous year's home run total while batting .231/.300/.385. He collected his most playing time for the Nationals in 2015, receiving 200 plate appearances in 97 games and batted .203/.250/.364 with 6 home runs and 27 RBI. Moore was outrighted from the Nationals' 40-man roster on March 25, 2016.\nAtlanta Braves.\nOn March 27, 2016, Moore was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Nate Freiman. He was assigned to the Triple-A Gwinnett Braves, where he hit .229/.276/.375 across 25 games. He elected free agency on October 11, 2016.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 13, 2016, Moore signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins. Moore was selected to Miami's 40-man roster on April 2, 2017, but was designated for assignment on April 17 after collecting 4 hits in 11 plate appearances. He was re-selected to the Marlins' roster on May 9 and finished the year with a .230 average with 6 HR and 30 RBI in 97 games for the club. He was outrighted off of the 40-man roster on October 7, 2017.

        "text": "Andrew Scott Hutchison (born August 22, 1990) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos of the Mexican League. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, Texas Rangers and the Detroit Tigers.\nCareer.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nMinor leagues.\nHutchison was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15th round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft from Lakeland High School in Lakeland, Florida. He made his minor league baseball debut with the Auburn Doubledays in 2010, and was later promoted to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts. In 68 innings that year, Hutchison pitched to a 2–3 record with a 2.49 ERA and 63 strikeouts. He began the 2011 season with Lansing, and later made starts with the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays and the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. In 2011 Hutchison posted a record of 14–5 with an ERA of 2.53 and 171 strikeouts over 149 innings.\nBefore the 2012 season, \"Baseball America\" ranked Hutchison as the Blue Jays' ninth best prospect. He made 3 starts with New Hampshire in 2012, and posted a 2–1 record with a 2.16 ERA.\n2012–2013.\nThe Blue Jays purchased Hutchison's contract from the Fisher Cats on April 19, 2012. He made his first MLB start on April 21, 2012 against the Kansas City Royals in Kansas City, pitching innings and yielding 5 earned runs, with 4 strikeouts and 3 walks in a 9–5 win. After making 11 starts, Hutchison was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a right ulnar collateral ligament sprain. Hutchison was later transferred to the 60-day disabled list, and on August 7 it was announced that he would require Tommy John surgery to repair his injured elbow. Hutchison posted a 5–3 record with a 4.60 ERA and 49 strikeouts over 11 starts (58 innings) in his first professional season.\nThe Blue Jays placed Hutchison on the 60-day disabled list on March 22, 2013 to make room for Todd Redmond on their 40-man roster. On May 7, 2013, it was reported that Hutchison was on track to return in early August, one year since undergoing surgery. The Blue Jays announced on August 8 that Hutchison would start for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on August 9 as part of his rehab assignment. He was activated from the disabled list on August 10, and optioned to Buffalo. Hutchison did not appear for the Blue Jays in 2013, and posted a 0–4 record and 4.84 ERA in 10 minor league appearances.\n2014–2016.\nFully healthy, Hutchison entered 2014 Spring Training and earned a spot in the starting rotation. He recorded his first 2 hits in an interleague game against the Philadelphia Phillies on May 6, 2014. In a game against the Texas Rangers on May 16, Hutchison pitched his first career complete game shutout, giving up just 3 hits and 1 walk with 6 strikeouts. He established a then career-high in strikeouts, with 10, in a 4–1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers on July 1, 2014. Hutchison experienced inconsistency in his performance from June 13 to early August, posting a 6.64 ERA over 8 starts in that time span. On August 6, he pitched 8 innings and took the win against the Baltimore Orioles 5–1, yielding only 1 hit (a solo home run by Chris Davis). In doing so, he joined Dave Stieb and Roy Halladay as the only Toronto pitchers to retire 26 of 27 batters faced in a start. Hutchison struck out a career-high 11 in a game on September 16 against the Baltimore Orioles. He would record the win in his final start of the season on September 26, finishing the 2014 campaign with an 11–13 record, 4.48 ERA, and a 1.26 WHIP over 184 innings pitched. Hutchison finished 8th in the American League in both strikeouts and K/9, with 184 and 8.97 respectively.\nOn March 31, 2015, Hutchison was named the Opening Day starter for the Blue Jays, and became the youngest Opening Day starter in franchise history. After taking the win on Opening Day, Hutchison struggled in his next two starts. On April 23, he took a perfect game into the 6th inning against the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the day with 8 innings pitched, and yielded 2 runs on 4 hits, while striking out 8, as the Blue Jays won 7–6. On May 25, Hutchison pitched his second career complete game shutout, defeating the Chicago White Sox 6–0. He needed only 96 pitches to complete the game, yielding 4 hits and striking out 8. He would struggle with his command from that point onward, posting an ERA above 5 into August. After earning his 12th win of the season on August 16, Hutchison was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo, as the Blue Jays did not need a fifth starter until August 29. Hutchison received the most run support in the American league leading him to record 12 wins in 28 starts despite posting an ERA of 5.57.\nOn January 16, 2016, Hutchison and the Blue Jays avoided salary arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $2.2 million contract. Hutchison entered spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Aaron Sanchez, Gavin Floyd, and Jesse Chavez. On March 28, it was announced that Sanchez would be the team's fifth starter, and Hutchison would be optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. Bisons manager Gary Allenson announced on April 5 that Hutchison would start on Opening Day against the Pawtucket Red Sox. While successful at Triple-A, Hutchison was described as \"a pitcher who’s too good for the minor leagues but doesn’t have a place on the big league club\", since he was placed sixth on the depth chart of the Jays' starting rotation. Hutchison was recalled by the Blue Jays on April 23 for a spot start against the Oakland Athletics the next day. He was optioned back to Buffalo after the game. On July 2, Hutchison was recalled from Triple-A. He would make two more appearances for Toronto; the latter one a start against the Detroit Tigers in place of Marco Estrada, who was unable to play due to lower back pain. He was returned to Buffalo the following day.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Blue Jays traded Hutchison to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Francisco Liriano, Reese McGuire, and Harold Ramírez. Hutchison was assigned to the Pirates' Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians. He was recalled on September 6. In six appearances for Pittsburgh in 2016, Hutchison posted a 5.56 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 11 innings.\nAfter struggling in 2017 spring training, Hutchison was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis on March 29. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to Indianapolis on September 15 to remove him from the 40-man roster. On October 2, 2017, Hutchison elected free agency.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn February 15, 2018, Hutchison signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies that included an invitation to spring training. The Phillies added him to their active roster on March 25. He was designated for assignment on May 31, 2018. After clearing waivers, Hutchison elected free agency on June 5.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn June 16, 2018, he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was 4–1 with a 2.14 ERA in nine games (seven starts) for the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers before he opted out of his minor league contract on July 31.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn August 4, 2018, Hutchison signed a major league contract with the Texas Rangers. He was added to the 25 man roster, and he started against the Baltimore Orioles on August 5.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn January 10, 2019, Hutchison signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees that included an invitation to spring training. He was released on June 17, 2019.\nMinnesota Twins.\nHutchison signed a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins on June 21, 2019 and was assigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nOn August 7, 2019, Hutchison was traded to the Los Angeles Angels in exchange for cash considerations. He became a free agent following the 2019 season.\nMilwaukee Milkmen.\nOn August 9, 2020, Hutchison signed with the Milwaukee Milkmen of the American Association. In 6 starts, he logged a 2-2 record and 4.09 ERA with 33 strikeouts in 22.0 innings pitched. Hutchison won the American Association championship with the Milkmen in 2020. He was released by the club on November 12.\nDetroit Tigers.\n2021.\nOn February 28, 2021, Hutchison signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers organization. The Tigers selected Hutchison's contract on August 15, 2021, and he made his debut with the team that afternoon in a start against the Cleveland Indians. Hutchison started 2 games for the Tigers, giving up 7 runs (2 earned) with 2 strikeouts through 6 innings pitched. On August 23, Hutchison was designated for assignment following the return of outfielder Akil Baddoo from the injured list. On August 26, Hutchison cleared waivers and was assigned outright to the Triple-A Toledo Mudhens. The Tigers again selected Hutchison's contract on September 7, 2021. He earned his first win as a Tiger on September 8 with two scoreless innings of relief against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He made 9 appearances (2 starts) for the Tigers in 2021, posting a 3–1 record and 2.11 ERA. On November 5, Hutchison was outrighted off of the 40-man roster and elected free agency.\n2022.\nOn March 14, 2022, Hutchison re-signed with the Tigers on a minor league deal, with an invitation to spring training. He made the Tigers opening day roster. Hutchison was designated for assignment on May 11 after appearing in 10 games. He cleared waivers and elected free agency on May 13. He re-signed a minor league deal with the Tigers on May 19. The Tigers once again selected Hutchison's contract on June 14 and added him to the active roster. Hutchison was again designated for assignment immediately after his start on June 19. Hutchison again cleared waivers and elected free agency on June 22. He once again re-signed a minor league deal with the Tigers on June 27. On July 5, 2022, the Tigers selected Hutchison's contract and added him to the active roster. This would be the fifth time in less than a year that his contract was selected. On July 10, Hutchison allowed two runs in six innings in a no-decision against the Chicago White Sox, earning his first quality start since 2015. On the season, he went 3–9 with a 4.53 ERA. He was designated for assignment again on October 11, and subsequently elected free agency.\nToronto Blue Jays (second stint).\nOn January 6, 2023, Hutchison signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays organization. In 9 starts for the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, he registered a 2-2 record and 5.66 ERA with 31 strikeouts in 35.0 innings pitched. On June 2, Hutchison was released by the Blue Jays.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (second stint).\nOn June 8, 2023, Hutchison signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.

        "text": "Clarence \"Pops\" Coleman (born April 4, 1884) was an American baseball catcher in the pre-Negro leagues. He played for the All Nations, Chicago Union Giants, and the Indianapolis ABCs and was about 36 years old and past his prime when the Negro National League was formed in 1920, so he did not make the cut against younger players.\nDuring the Pre-Negro leagues years of the 19-teens, Coleman caught for pitching greats such as John Donaldson, José Méndez, Hurley McNair, Jim Jeffries, and later in his career of the 1920s, even caught for Satchel Paige. Sources often show, because of his advanced age, Coleman was nicknamed \"Pops.\" Other sources say his nickname strayed into \"Captain Cola.\"\nIn 1931, newspapers still show Clarence Coleman was working as a catcher for the travelling Gilkerson's Union Giants. However, the newspaper claims his age at the time to be 54, and other records show he was 47 years old at the time.\nIn the 1940s, when Coleman was in his 50s, he continued to live in Chicago with his family, according to Census reports. During 1942, when Coleman registered for selective service and the World War II draft, he reported that he was working for the Works Progress Administration at the milk depot. His draft records and census records show he was married to Luvenia Coleman.\nIn some sources, his career is combined with that of Arthur Coleman. "

        "text": "The National Points Championship is a season-long competition for BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars. The winner is granted the honour of racing with a silver roof for the following season.\nHistory.\nThe first season-long championship started in 1956. Drivers' scores at every stock car meeting were recorded to create the championship table. During the late 1990s, when Frankie Wainman Junior dominated, there was criticism that the National Points Championship was predictable and favoured drivers who had the money to race at as many meetings as possible. The National Series was created in 2002. Rather than the points accumulated over the entire season counting towards the winner, the National Series was competed for over 35 designated meetings. The season-long National Points Championship survived, but its importance was downgraded, and the privilege of racing with a silver roof for the following season was transferred from it to the National Series.\nIn 2009, the National Series was amended. This time, the top ten points-scoring drivers over the first two-thirds of the season were entered in the National Series Shootout, beginning with no points except for a small number of meeting attendance points. The drivers raced over ten designated Shootout rounds, with the points scored in them deciding the winner of the National Series. In 2010, the number of competing drivers was increased to twelve. From 2012, the National Series Shootout was rebranded the National Points Championship Shootout.\nThe most successful driver in National Points Championships and National Series is Frankie Wainman Junior, who has won fourteen. Other notable multiple winners include Stuart Smith (thirteen), John Lund (six), Fred Mitchell (three), Andy Smith (three) and Frankie Wainman (three)."

        "title": "2012 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2012 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2011–12 season, and the conclusion of the season's playoffs, contested between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeated the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder. It was played from June 12 to 21, 2012.\nLed by the \"Big Three\" of season MVP LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, the Heat defeated the Thunder in five games. The Thunder, led by three future MVPs in Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden, had home-court advantage, and won Game 1 before the Heat won the next four games to clinch their second title in history. The win by the Heat earned James his first championship. James was also named the Finals MVP.\nBackground.\nMiami Heat.\nThis was the second consecutive appearance for the Heat, after losing to the Dallas Mavericks in . This was also their second Finals appearance in the \"Big Three\" era, being led by superstar LeBron James, shooting guard Dwyane Wade, and power forward Chris Bosh. Their other Finals appearance was in , when they defeated the Mavericks to win their first NBA title.\nIn the regular season, the Heat finished with 46 wins, earning the second seed in the Eastern Conference. In the first round, they defeated the New York Knicks 4–1, marking the first time since 1997 that the Heat beat their arch rivals in the postseason. In the next two rounds, the Heat overcame major series deficits that nearly eliminated them from the postseason, but survived thanks to a string of victories. In the Conference Semifinals, they defeated the Indiana Pacers 4–2 despite trailing 2–1 and losing Chris Bosh to injury. Then, the Heat survived a grueling Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, winning 4–3 despite trailing 3–2. The Heat’s comeback vs the Celtics was extremely notable thanks to LeBron James’ epic 45 point performance in Game 6, allowing the Heat to win game 7 at home and advance to the Finals. The Heat also became the first team since the 1994–95 Houston Rockets to overcome multiple series deficits en route to the finals.\nThe 2011–2012 Miami Heat included several new players that had not played for the team during its 2011 Finals run, including Shane Battier, Eddy Curry, Ronny Turiaf, and rookies Terrel Harris and Norris Cole.\nOklahoma City Thunder.\nThis was the Thunder's first NBA Finals appearance since the team relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City in 2008. Including their seasons as the Seattle SuperSonics, this was also the club's fourth Finals appearance, and first since , when they lost to the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. The team was seeking their first NBA championship since .\nThe Thunder finished with 47 wins, placing them as the second seed in the Western Conference. During the playoffs, they defeated the last three Western Conference Finalists in sequential order. First, they dethroned the defending champion Dallas Mavericks in a 4–0 first round sweep. Next, they dispatched the Los Angeles Lakers in the conference semifinals 4–1. Then, in the Western Conference Finals, they defeated the top seeded San Antonio Spurs 4–2, despite losing the first two games, snapping San Antonio’s 20 game winning streak in the process.\nThe Thunder entered the Finals as the second-youngest finalists in NBA history. In addition, Daequan Cook faced the team that traded him to the Thunder in 2010.\nRegular season series.\nThe season series was tied, 1–1, with both teams winning at their home floor.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Thunder defeated the Heat, 105–94, in Game 1. Miami held the lead for most of the first three quarters, including a 13-point lead at one point during the second quarter. The Heat made five three-pointers to jump to a 29–22 lead by the end of the first quarter, but Oklahoma City kept on pace with Miami to keep the score at 54–47 by halftime. The Thunder then took the lead for good with 16 seconds left in the third quarter after Russell Westbrook made a free throw to make it 74–73. Kevin Durant led Oklahoma City with 36 points, while Westbrook had 27. LeBron James led the Heat with 30 points, but was held to one basket during the first eight minutes of the fourth quarter.\nGame 2.\nThe Heat defeated the Thunder 100–96 in Game 2, tying the series at one game a piece and giving the Thunder their first home playoff loss of the season. Miami never trailed, building a 27–15 first quarter lead, and holding a 17-point advantage at one point. The Thunder attempted a comeback in the fourth quarter, and with 37 seconds left in the game, Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant made a three-pointer to cut the deficit, 98–96. Durant would miss a game-tying jumper in the closing seconds as Miami held off Oklahoma City for the Game 2 win. The play did not come without controversy however as many observers had felt that James had fouled Durant on the right hip during the shot, a potential sixth foul that would have taken the Heat superstar out of the game in the process. LeBron James led the Heat with 32 points, while Durant scored 32 of his own to lead the Thunder.\nGame 3.\nMiami won Game 3, 91–85, to go up two games to one in the series. Miami had a slim 47–46 halftime lead before Oklahoma City began the third quarter with a 10–4 run, eventually building a 10-point lead midway through the period. However, Miami scored the last seven points in the third quarter to regain the lead at 69–67. With 7:36 remaining in the game, the Thunder came back to retake the lead at 77–76, but the Heat then scored eight unanswered points to build an 84–77 advantage with 3:47 left. A 6–0 run by Oklahoma City pulled them within one point of Miami with 90 seconds left, but the Thunder could not score again for the rest of the game while the Heat made five insurance free throws. LeBron James led the Heat with 29 points and 14 rebounds, while Kevin Durant scored 25 points to lead the Thunder.\nGame 4.\nMiami won Game 4, 104–98, to go up three games to one in the series. The Thunder jumped to a 33–19 lead by the end the first quarter, but the Heat rallied to cut the score to 49–46 at halftime, thanks to two huge three-pointers by Heat rookie Norris Cole. The two teams remained neck-and-neck throughout most of the third quarter, with Miami holding a 4-point lead at the start of fourth period. However, for the final 16 minutes of the game, Russell Westbrook (who led the Thunder with 43 points) and Kevin Durant (who had 28 points) were the only two Oklahoma City players able to score. With the other Thunder players struggling to make their shots, Miami was able to pull away in the end, largely thanks to late-game heroics from LeBron James, Mario Chalmers and Dwyane Wade. LeBron James led the Heat with 26 points, including the go ahead three pointer, but had to sit out during the final two minutes of the game due to leg cramps. Mario Chalmers scored 25 points and made two key plays to seal Miami's win: a driving layup around a well-positioned Serge Ibaka and two free throws after a rare mistake by Westbrook (he fouled Chalmers after the point guard recovered Shane Battier's tip on a jump ball with less than 1 minute left, thinking that the shot clock would reset, while NBA rules do not reset at that point in a 4th quarter if the team that previously had the ball re-gains possession off the tip).\nGame 5.\nMiami won Game 5, 121–106, to win the series, four games to one. After keeping it a close game in the first half, the Thunder were outscored 36–22 in the third quarter, with Miami leading as much as 27 at one point. Miami was fueled by strong performances by their \"Big Three\" of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, as well as by Mike Miller, who was 7 for 8 for three-pointers, ending the night with 23 points. Miller only entered the game because Wade encountered foul trouble in the first half, with Coach Erik Spoelstra telling the variously-injured veteran the Heat just needed him to hold the fort until the 2nd quarter began; when Miller hit two three-pointers, Spoelstra asked him if he could keep playing and Miller said yes, leading to 23 minutes on the court that were critical in blowing the game open for Miami. The team tied an NBA Finals record for most 3-pointers in a game with 14. With three minutes remaining in the game, both teams took their starters out of the game, with the Heat still leading by more than 20 points. With their Game 5 win, the Heat won their second NBA championship in team history, and the first for several Heat players, including James, who was named the NBA Finals MVP after averaging 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists in the finals, capping it all off with his first triple double of the season in the final game. For the Thunder, Kevin Durant had 32 points, and 11 rebounds; Russell Westbrook had 19 points and 6 assists; and James Harden led the bench with 19 points, 5 assists, and 4 rebounds. This was James Harden’s final game with the Thunder. He was traded to the Rockets during the offseason. \nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC and Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy served as commentators. ESPN Radio aired it as well and had Jim Durham, Jack Ramsey and Hubie Brown as commentators."

        "text": "Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette () is an early work by Vincent van Gogh. The small and undated oil-on-canvas painting featuring a skeleton and cigarette is part of the permanent collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. It was most likely painted in the winter of 1885–86 as a satirical comment on conservative academic practices. Before it was common to use live humans as models, the academic routine included the study of skeletons to develop an understanding of human anatomy. Van Gogh was in Antwerp, Belgium at that time attending classes at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, which he later said were boring and taught him nothing.\nVan Gogh included skeletons in another work from his Antwerp period, a sketch of a \"Hanging skeleton and cat\". In 1887–88, van Gogh painted two more paintings with skulls, the only other works of his (besides a drawing from the same period) to use skulls as a motif.\nThe work measures . It is considered a vanitas or memento mori, at a time when van Gogh himself was in poor health. It may be influenced by works of Hercules Segers, a 17th-century Dutch artist, or of Félicien Rops, a Belgian contemporary of van Gogh. Although often interpreted as a criticism of smoking, Van Gogh was a keen smoker himself, and continued to smoke until his death in 1890.\nThe painting was held by Van Gogh's brother Theo Van Gogh at the time of his death in 1891. It was inherited by his widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger until her death in 1925, and then by their son Vincent Willem van Gogh until 1962, when it was acquired by the Van Gogh Foundation. It was on loan to the Stedelijk Museum from 1962 to 1973, and has been on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1973.\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "1951 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season",
        "text": "The 1951 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the ninth season of the circuit. The teams Battle Creek Belles, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kalamazoo Lassies, Kenosha Comets, Peoria Redwings, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 112-game schedule, while the Shaugnessy playoffs featured the top four teams from each half of the regular season.\nIn 1951, many things changed in relation to the previous season, when attendance began to decline dramatically. The Racine Belles franchise was moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, while the Chicago Colleens and Springfield Sallies traveling teams were disbanded. Betty Foss of Fort Wayne led all hitters for the second year in a row with a .368 batting average, breaking her own single-season record of .346 set in her rookie season. Foss also topped the league with 34 doubles, setting an all-time single-season record that would never be surpassed. Nine pitchers recorded an earned run average below 2.00, while Rose Gacioch of Rockford was the only one to gain 20 victories during the year. The Player of the Year Award was given to South Bend pitcher Jean Faut, who posted a 15–7 record with a 1.33 ERA and a league-leading 135 strikeouts, including a perfect game against Rockford on July 21 of that season.\nDuring the best-of-three series, first-place South Bend defeated third-place Fort Wayne, two games to one, while second-place Grand Rapids swept fourth-place Rockford in two games. South Bend pitching star Jean Faut drove in a run and held Fort Wayne to a run in Game 1, and later struck out nine batters and allowed one run in Game 3 to advance to the finals. In the other series, Rockford's Helen Nicol gave up six hits and shut out Grand Rapids in the first contest, while Marie Mansfield hurled a 7–6, 11-inning victory to defeat the Chicks.\nThe final series took all five games to decide the champion team. Rockford held a 2–0 advantage in the series and looked to take it all, but South Bend rebounded and won the last three games to clinch the title. In Game 3, Faut stopped the Peaches in their tracks, pitching a six-hit, 3–2 victory, and picked up the win in a seven-inning relief effort in Game 5 to continue her winning ways. South Bend batted a collective .275 average in the finals, with Jane Stoll leading the offense with a .333 average (6-for-18) and six RBI, while Senaida Wirth batted .412 (7-for-17) and scored four runs, and Betty Wagoner hit .389 (7-for-18) with five runs.\nIn 1951, the AAGPBL attendance declined for the third straight year. As revenues fell, individual teams' funds were limited to advertise nationally as a way of recruiting scattered baseball talent. With no centralized control of publicity, promotion, rookie training teams, and equalization of player talent, the League began to break down. The Kenosha and Peoria franchises withdrew at the end of the year, leaving the league with six teams for the next season."

Malik and his former NCAA partner, Rich Benson, made the semi-finals of the Kuala Lumpur Open in 1993. Also that year, Malik and Francisco Montana, upset top seeds Jacco Eltingh and Paul Haarhuis at the 1993 Schenectady Open. In 1994, Malik teamed up with Jeff Tarango in the ATP St. Pölten event and the pair finished runners-up. He remained with Tarango for the 1995 Australian Open, the only Grand Slam tournament that the Malaysian played during his career. The pair lost in the opening round to Jon Ireland and Libor Pimek, losing 7–9 in the deciding set.\nHe had his best singles performance at the Kuala Lumpur Open in 1994, when he reached the quarter-finals.\nBy the time he made his last Davis Cup appearance in 1995, Malik had taken part in 13 ties for Malaysia and played 32 rubbers, from which he won 17. He won 12 of his 20 singles matches and five of his 12 doubles fixtures.\nSince retiring, Malik has worked as a businessman in the United States, but has also spent some time coaching the Malaysian Davis Cup team."

        "text": "Justin James Wilson (born August 18, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers, Chicago Cubs and New York Mets. Prior to his professional career, Wilson played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs, where he was a member of the 2008 College World Series champions.\nHigh school and college career.\nWilson attended Buchanan High School in Clovis, California. Out of high school, the Los Angeles Dodgers drafted Wilson in the 37th round (1126th overall) of the 2005 Major League Baseball Draft, but he did not sign, opting to enroll at Fresno State University, where he played college baseball for the Fresno State Bulldogs baseball team. In his junior season, Wilson was named to the College World Series All-Tournament Team, as Fresno State won the 2008 College World Series.\nProfessional career.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nAfter his junior season at Fresno State, the Pirates drafted Wilson in the fifth round (144th overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft, and he signed with the Pirates.\nIn 2009, he played for the Lynchburg Hillcats. In 2010, he played for the Altoona Curve. In 2011, he played for the Indianapolis Indians. The Pirates added him to their 40-man roster after the 2011 season to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nOn April 29, 2012, pitching for the Indianapolis Indians against the Durham Bulls, Wilson pitched the first innings of a combined no-hitter, finished off by Jumbo Diaz and Doug Slaten. “It was pretty awesome,” Wilson said after the game. “Great for Jumbo to come in and not give up a hit. And Doug as well. Great defense all around. Outstanding play to end the game, it was an awesome play. And then José Morales behind the plate was just outstanding tonight.” On leaving the game with a no-hitter, Wilson said: “It was tough, but you’ve got to trust your manager.”“He was making the call on what he thought, which was totally okay with me. Totally understandable. I respect him, and understand what he was doing.” With two outs in the ninth inning, Reid Brignac sent a slow rolling check swing to second base, then Anderson Hernández ranged in, bare handed the ball, and made the flip to first base to complete the no-hitter. On August 9, 2012, pitching for the Indianapolis Indians, Wilson pitched his second no-hitter of the 2012 season, an eight inning, complete game no-hitter against the Charlotte Knights (rain ended the game in the eighth inning). Wilson was promoted to the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 20, 2012. Wilson made his major league debut the same day, pitching one scoreless inning, with three strikeouts.\nWilson had a 6–1 win–loss record with a 2.08 earned run average (ERA) for the Pirates in 2013.

        "title": "2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team",
        "text": "The 2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball team was the first season of the program's new head coach Darin Erstad and featured a new coaching staff and a roster that included 12 new players. The Huskers entered their first season of Big Ten baseball after 15 seasons in the Big 12 Conference that included three regular-season titles and four tournament crowns.\n2011.\nIn their last season in the Big 12 Conference, the Huskers went 30–25 overall and had a ninth-place 9–17 record in conference play, missing out in the Big 12 tournament for the third consecutive season. Cody Asche became a second-team all-American and a first-team all-conference player while Casey Hauptman won second-team all conference honors. They were both drafted in the 2011 Major League Baseball draft. At the conclusion of the season, Mike Anderson and the entire coaching staff were terminated on May 22, 2011, and the University of Nebraska hired former Husker and Major League All-Star Darin Erstad on June 2, 2011, as head coach after one season as a volunteer assistant coach. A few days later, Ted Silva was hired as well as former Cornhuskers Will Bolt and Jeff Christy.\nPreview.\nPreseason picks.\nThe Big Ten coaches picked Nebraska to finish fourth out of the league's 11 teams in 2012. Three Husker juniors were also named to the ‘Players to Watch List’, including right-handed pitcher Travis Huber, right-handed pitcher Tom Lemke and first baseman-designated hitter Kash Kalkowski.\nSchedule summary.\nThe Huskers played 31 home games at Hawks Field and had 13 contests against 2011 NCAA Tournament teams, including a four-game home stand against 2011 College World Series qualifier California. The 56-game schedule started with 10 games on the road before the Huskers hosted their home opener against former Big 12 foe Kansas State on Tuesday, March 6. The Huskers played eight Big Ten Conference series, with three conference schools not on the schedule, including Penn State and Michigan State, as well as Wisconsin, which doesn't have a baseball program.\nCoaching staff.\nA 14-year MLB veteran and World Series champion, Erstad took over at his alma mater, where he was one of the most successful players in program history. Prior to becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 1995 amateur draft, Erstad was a first-team All-American and the Big Eight Co-Player of the Year as a junior in 1995.\n\"It is a great honor to be the head coach of the Nebraska baseball program\", Erstad said. \"My family and I believe strongly in what the University stands for, and I am excited to have this opportunity to help influence kids’ lives in a positive way and help them turn into young men. I am committed to helping them grow as people.\"\nErstad is not the only former Husker on his coaching staff, as he brought on Will Bolt as his associate head coach and Jeff Christy as the team's volunteer assistant. A four-year starter and team captain on Nebraska's 2001 and 2002 College World Series teams, Bolt was a volunteer assistant on the Huskers’ 2005 squad that set a school record with 57 wins and produced the program's first win at the College World Series. Christy was a junior on the 2005 team and caught a school-record 64 games that season.\n\"It is an incredible opportunity to come back to a place where I had so many fond memories as a player and coach\", Bolt said. \"I am humbled and excited to work at my alma mater, and looking forward to making an impact in a coaching role and helping this program reach its goals. It is an honor to be included on a staff put together by a Husker legend and long-time big leaguer in Coach Erstad.\"\nFor his pitching coach, Erstad plucked Ted Silva away from California where he had coached at UC Irvine and Loyola Marymount over the previous four seasons. As a player, Silva was a first-team All-American at Cal State Fullerton and earned the win in the Titans’ 1995 national championship game against USC in the College World Series.\nSchedule.\n! style=\";\" | Postseason\nSeason summary.\nThe Nebraska baseball team met the Gonzaga Bulldogs for the first time on February 17 and dropped its opening game of the 2012 season by a score of 7–4. Playing the first game of a three-game series at the Peoria Sports Complex (the Spring training home of the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres in Peoria, Arizona), the Huskers took a 4–3 lead into the seventh inning. Nebraska was unable to hold on though, as a three-run eighth inning from the Zags doomed the Huskers. The first victory of the season fell through their hands on in game 2 as Gonzaga rallied for a 10–8 victory to take game two of the three-game series. The Huskers took an 8–5 lead into the top of the ninth, but the Bulldog bats came alive with five runs to steal the win after committing seven errors in the game. The ninth inning was again unkind to Nebraska in the finale as the Bulldogs erased a 4–2 deficit with three runs in the top of the ninth to steal victory for the second straight game.\nThe next weekend the Huskers traveled to Corpus Christi, Texas, to play in the Kleberg Bank College Classic at Whataburger Field. In game 1, Zach Hirsch picked up his first win as a husker and Head Coach Darin Erstad earned his first win as the Huskers' head coach in a 5–2 win over the Utah Utes. The next day, Nebraska beat Utah again and Texas A&amp;M Chorpus Christi with a combined score of 22–1. The Huskers finished the tournament with a perfect 4–0 record as they came from behind to beat UNLV in the first ever meeting between the 2 teams. The offense scored 35 runs on 54 hits over the three days and 8 Huskers joined the all tournament team – Cory Burleson, Josh Scheffert, Bryan Peters, Kurt Farmer, Chad Christensen (MVP), Rich Sanguinetti, Richard Stock, and Jon Keller.\nOn March 2, Nebraska went north to play in the Dairy Queen Classic, one of the longest running tournaments in the nation, in Minnesota played at the Metrodome. It was the fifth time they have competed in the event. The Huskers dropped their opening game of the Dairy Queen Classic by a score of 4–1. The Huskers totaled six hits on the day and worked seven walks off the WVU pitching staff, but were doomed by the 10 runners they left on base. New Mexico State was the next team to face as Nebraska entered the ninth down 4–2 when the bats came alive and Rich Sanguinetti ended the game with a two-run walk-off home run with 2 outs capping a dramatic ninth inning for the Huskers with for a 6–4 win over the Aggies. The Huskers won their last game defeating conference foe, Minnesota 10–3 in a non conference game. On offense, after scoring only seven runs through the first two games, the Husker offense exploded for seven runs in the first four frames against the Gophers. Three Huskers earned all-tournament honors, including Richard Stock at first base, Austin Darby in the outfield and Michael Pritchard at designated hitter. Pritchard also earned the tournament's Silver Stick Award as the weekend's most valuable hitter.\nAfter a 6–4 road stint, the huskers headed home for a 17-game homestand starting with Kansas state. A pair of four-run innings carried Nebraska to a 9–6 win over the Kansas State Wildcats at Hawks Field in front of 4,169 fans.

The next day, Kale Kiser hit a home run for the second straight day and junior Ryan Hander picked his first win of the year as the team moved to 8–4 with a 4–1 win over Division II Nebraska-Kearney.\nThat weekend, 2011 College World Series qualifier California Bears came to town for a four-game series. In game one, the Huskers found themselves in a hole, falling behind 0–7, but a pair of runs in both the eighth and ninth innings capped an 8–8 comeback, extending the game into extra innings, but the Huskers were unable to pull out a win after the Bears plated three runs in the top of the 11th inning to win 11–8. In game 2, Nebraska had an offensive show in front of 5,298 fans with a 12–5 win over the Bears blasting three home runs on the day, including a grand slam by Rich Sanguinetti. The Bears responded and Nebraska was unable to find a rhythm in game 3 in a 4–0 loss with only 3 hits on the game but rebounded in the series finale breaking through with eight runs in the bottom of the fifth inning evening the series with a 9–5 victory for a 2–2 series split.\nThe Huskers played for the 5th day in a row and 1st of 5 games in week 5 against South Dakota State by a score of 12–3 hammering out 15 hits before Louisiana tech came for a 4-game series. Nebraska won game 1 9–2 as Cory Burleson hit an inside-the-park home run, the first one by a Husker since Jake Mullinax hit one against West Virginia at the 2004 Dairy Queen Classic at the Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minn. The next day there was plenty of offense against the Bulldogs with 24 hits in a 22–3 win which is the most runs in over eight years, as they also scored 22 in a win over Kent State at the Ultimate Dugout Baseball Fiesta in Albuquerque, N.M, on Feb. 22, 2004. Behind a career-high five hits from Josh Scheffert, the Nebraska baseball team posted its fifth straight win with an 11–4 victory over the Louisiana.

Nebraska rebounded in game 2 with an 18–5 win over the Fighting Illini to tie the series. Trailing 3–0 going into the bottom of the second, NU plated 11 runs on seven hits, as the first nine batters of the inning reached base and scored. All but one of the Huskers' starters had at least one hit on the day. The rubber match went to the Huskers as they put together one of its best games of the season with a 13–3 win over the Illinois to win in the first ever Big Ten series. The Huskers outscored Illinois by a combined score of 31–8 in the final two games of the series to open conference play with a series win for the first time since 2008 when they swept Kansas State in Manhattan. Husker fans topped the 5,000 mark in all three games, with a combined 15,697 fans coming out to see the Huskers open conference play.\nThe team wrapped up its 17-game home stand with a 6–3 win over the Kansas State Wildcats in a mid week game. The Huskers started and ended the home stand with wins over the Wildcats. Now 18–9 on the season and 2–1 in Big Ten play, the Huskers went 12–5 on the home stand.\nNebraska headed to Northwestern for their first road conference series on March 30. They opened the series with a 7–4 win over the Wildcats but a season-high six errors from the Husker defense combined with 12 strikeouts from the NU offense resulted in an 8–4 loss in game 2 while none of the Wildcats' eight runs were earned off the Husker pitching staff. It is the Huskers' first loss this season when out-hitting their opponent as the Huskers out-hit the Wildcats, 7–6.

They picked up their 20th win of the season to sweep the Kansas State Wildcats with a 6–0 win as five pitchers combined for the four-hit shutout.\nThe Huskers returned home to host the 12–14 Iowa Hawkeyes in their 3rd conference series. A four-run fifth inning propelled the Iowa Hawkeyes to a 4–3 series-opening win over the Nebraska. The Huskers took a 2–0 lead into the fifth and cut Iowa's lead to one with a run in the bottom of the fifth, but were unable to plate a run over the final four innings to tie the game. The Huskers evened the series in game 2 with a strong outing from Brandon Pierce in his first career conference start to help the Huskers post a 9–4 win. A game-tying two-RBI triple from Pat Kelly followed by a walk-off single from Kale Kiser completed a dramatic ninth-inning comeback by the Huskers, as the Huskers rallied for a 9–8 win to take the series.\nThe Huskers hosted Creighton in the first of three meetings on April 10. A career-high 8 innings from sophomore Jon Keller carried Nebraska in a 5–3 victory over the Bluejays. Keller improved to 4–1 on the year, as he gave up just two runs (one earned) on three hits, while striking out six.\nNebraska traveled to Columbus, Ohio to play the 20–12 Ohio State who is tied with Nebraska at second place in the Big Ten.

They secured the No. 4 seed at the Big Ten Tournament with a 7–3 win over the Michigan ending the season with a 14–10 conference record.\nThe Huskers opened the post season against Michigan State.

        "text": "Queen's Gaels women's ice hockey is the representative women's ice hockey program of Queen's University at Kingston in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The team plays in the women's ice hockey section of Ontario University Athletics (OUA), one of the four regional governing bodies that comprise U Sports.\nThe first records of organized women's ice hockey in Canada date back to university level games played in the 1890s. Queen's University at Kingston and the University of Toronto were two of the first Canadian universities to field women's ice hockey teams.\nHistory.\nElizabeth Graham would play hockey for Queen's University and is credited as the first goaltender ever to wear a mask for protection. She used the mask in 1927, and her use of the mask was noted in the Montreal Daily Star. The mask she donned was actually a fencing mask and there was speculation that she opted to use the mask as a means of protecting recently-performed dental work.\nDuring the 1960s, a group of dedicated students led by Cookie Cartwright revived the women's ice hockey program at Queen's University. Cartwright and the Golden Gaels would go on to capture the first women's university championship. Known originally as the Golden Gals, the program captured the OWIAA title in the 1974–75 season.\nAfter 32 long years, the Queen's women's hockey team captured their first OUA Championship in 2010–11. The team won all five of their playoff games in overtime, knocking off nationally ranked opponents Windsor in the Quarter-final, Wilfrid Laurier in the Semifinal and Guelph in the Final. Game 1 of the OUA Championship series was historic in its own right for the Gaels as the team won the longest collegiate hockey game in history, a six-overtime marathon. The game finally game to an end after 107 minutes and 14 seconds of overtime when Morgan McHaffie banged home a rebound past Guelph goaltender Danielle Skoufranis. Queen's goaltender Melanie \"Mel\" Dodd-Moher made 66 saves for the win.\nThe team moved on to their first CIS Championship following the OUA playoffs where the Gaels defeated the defending champion Alberta Pandas and the host Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks to win the bronze medal.\nMorgan McHaffie was recognized as the 2012 OUA women's hockey Player of the Year. She led the OUA league scoring race with 38 points (16 goals and 22 assists). She ranked fourth overall in CIS scoring. She was the first Gael to earn Player of the Year honors since the 2003–04 campaign. She was also recognized as an OUA First-Team All-Star.\nFreshman Taryn Pilon was named to the 2012 OUA All-Rookie team. She appeared in every Queen's contest, while recording 21 points and taking only one penalty. Defender Katie Duncan was making her first appearances on an all-star team as she was named to the 2012 OUA Second Team All-Stars. Duncan finished the 2011–12 campaign tied for fourth among OUA defenders with 15 points. In addition, Duncan led all blueliners with six goals on the season."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2013)",
        "text": "The 2013 Royal Rumble was the 26th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on January 27, 2013, at the US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2013 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 29. It was the last Royal Rumble to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, which was unified with the WWE Championship in December; subsequently, this was the last Royal Rumble to include two eligible championships for the Royal Rumble winner until the 2017 event.\nFive matches were contested at the event, including one on the Pre-Show. In the main event, The Rock defeated CM Punk to win the WWE Championship, which was his first championship since 2002 that also ended Punk's reign at 434 days. On the undercard, John Cena won the 2013 Royal Rumble match, making him the fourth multiple Royal Rumble winner. In another prominent match, Antonio Cesaro defeated The Miz to retain his United States Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2013, the winner could choose to challenge for either the WWE Championship or World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 29. The 2013 event was the 26th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 27, 2013, at the US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches, including one on the Pre-Show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, with storylines produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nOn July 23, 2012, during \"Raw 1000\", The Rock announced that he would challenge for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble. Later that night, reigning champion CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, and John Cena each stated that they'd face The Rock as defending champion; later that night, Punk turned heel, attacking and laying out The Rock. Punk defended the championship for the rest of the year, while on December 23, 2012, The Rock tweeted to Punk that he was ready for the Royal Rumble. On the January 7 episode of \"Raw\", Punk retained the WWE Championship against Ryback in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match after The Shield interfered. They also did during Punk's defense against Ryback and John Cena back at Survivor Series; this win secured Punk as the one who would defend against The Rock. On the January 21 episode of \"Raw\" while speaking about beating Punk at the Royal Rumble, The Shield assaulted The Rock. After the assault, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that if The Shield interfered in the match, Punk will be stripped of his title.\nBig Show began a feud with Alberto Del Rio after humiliating Del Rio's personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, sarcastically picking him to fight Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship during \"Champion's Choice Night\" on the New Year's Eve 2013 episode of \"Raw\", leading to a disqualification win for Big Show after Del Rio interfered. On the January 11, 2013, episode of \"SmackDown\", Del Rio defeated Big Show in a Last Man Standing match for the championship. Three days later on \"Raw\", Big Show announced that he would invoke his rematch clause at the pay-per-view. The week after, he made the match a Last Man Standing Match.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThe Royal Rumble Pre-Show match featured reigning United States Champion Antonio Cesaro defending his title against The Miz. During the match, Miz attempted a diving attack and injured his leg. Shortly after, Cesaro won after landing the Neutralizer.\nPreliminary matches.\nAs the PPV portion of the show began, a backstage segment was shown with Bret Hart wishing Alberto Del Rio good luck in his match. He then gave Ricardo Rodriguez a pair of his signature sunglasses.\nThe opening match on the PPV telecast (and second on the card overall) featured reigning World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio defending his title against Big Show in a Last Man Standing match. After Del Rio managed to beat the count after being chokeslammed through a table from an elevated position on the entrance stage, he managed to win when he locked in the Cross Armbreaker while Rodriguez duct taped Show's legs to the bottom rope. Show was unable to free himself in time and was counted out.\nNext, reigning WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No (Daniel Bryan and Kane) defended their titles against Team Rhodes Scholars (Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow). The match ended when Bryan applied the \"No! Lock\" on Sandow, forcing him to submit.\nAfter that was the annual Royal Rumble match making it the first time in 7 years (since back in 2006) that the Royal Rumble Match would not be the main event of the namesake PPV. Dolph Ziggler (as per the \"Beat The Clock\" stipulations from \"Raw\") chose to enter first, followed by the surprise return of Chris Jericho at #2. Another surprise entry, Goldust returned at #8, and spent most of his time battling with his half brother Cody Rhodes (entrant #3), who eventually eliminated him. Sheamus entered at #11, trying to become the fourth man to win back-to-back Rumbles, joining Hulk Hogan ('90-'91), Shawn Michaels ('95-'96), and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin ('97-'98). Kofi Kingston (the #4 entrant) provided a highlight, for when he was about to be eliminated, he jumped onto the back of recently eliminated Tensai, who put him on the Spanish announce table. Kingston made it back onto the apron using John Bradshaw Layfield's chair like a pogo stick, but was quickly eliminated by Rhodes before reentering the ring. Following this, The Godfather made a surprise appearance at #17, only to be immediately eliminated by Ziggler. John Cena entered at #19, quickly eliminating Rhodes and #10 entrant Heath Slater. Daniel Bryan (#21) and Kane (#24) teamed up to eliminate #23 The Great Khali, but Bryan then eliminated Kane. When #22 Antonio Cesaro sent Bryan over the top rope, Kane caught him, only to drop him on the floor, eliminating him from the match. Later, NXT tournament winner (and #16 entrant) Bo Dallas managed to eliminate Intercontinental Champion Wade Barrett (#18), leading to Barrett eliminating him and perform the Bull Hammer on Dallas, despite having already been eliminated. Ryback entered at #30 and eliminated three wrestlers in quick fashion. Ziggler finally eliminated Jericho after nearly 48 minutes. The final four consisted of Ziggler, Sheamus, Cena and Ryback. Sheamus eliminated Ziggler (who lasted nearly 50 minutes) and tried to execute the Broque Kick on Ryback, but Ryback managed to eliminate him. After a few minutes of going back and forth, Cena then eliminated Ryback to win the Rumble, making him the fourth wrestler to win multiple Royal Rumble matches (as he won the match in 2008 as well).\nMain event match.\nThe main event and fifth match on the card featured reigning WWE Champion CM Punk defending his title against The Rock. During the match, Rock attempted to perform a Rock Bottom through the Spanish announce table on Punk, but the table collapsed beneath them. Rock performed a Rock Bottom outside the ring, but Punk kicked out of a pin attempt. When Rock attempted to perform a People's Elbow, the arena went dark and Rock was attacked by an unknown entity, believed by the commentators to be The Shield. When the lights came back, the assailant(s) were nowhere to be found, and Rock had been driven through the English announce table, allowing Punk to get the winning pin. As he celebrated with the title, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came out and reminded Punk that if the Shield interfered (which while McMahon said he could not see it, he knew enough to realize what had happened) he would strip him of the title. Before he could however, the Rock said he wanted to take the title from Punk and told McMahon to instead restart the match. McMahon did so, and Rock won the match with a Spinebuster followed by a second People's Elbow, winning the WWE Championship for the eighth time and ending Punk's historic reign at 434 days.\nReception.\nThe event garnered 512,000 pay-per-view buys, the highest in four years.\nAftermath.\nCM Punk, livid that his reign had ended, invoked his rematch clause at Elimination Chamber, but The Rock defeated him and retained the championship. Punk then challenged Cena for his contendership opportunity, which Cena accepted and defeated Punk. Punk later went to WrestleMania to try to end The Undertaker's undefeated streak. After Elimination Chamber, The Rock retired the spinner and bling belt (which was Cena's design for the championship and used by the company for the past eight years) and unveiled a new belt to represent the WWE Championship.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", John Cena announced that he would challenge the reigning WWE Champion with his winning the Royal Rumble match. With The Rock retaining the championship, this would set up a rematch between The Rock and Cena from last year's WrestleMania. Cena would go on to win the match and the championship, making him a record 11-time WWE Champion.\nThe 2013 Royal Rumble was the last to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, as well as the last time it was a choice for the winner of the titular match, as the title was unified with the WWE Championship at December's event, with the latter being renamed to WWE World Heavyweight Championship. It would in turn be the last Royal Rumble in which two world championships were eligible to be challenged for by the Royal Rumble winner until the 2017 event."

        "text": "The 1949 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the seventh season of the circuit. With the Chicago Colleens and Springfield Sallies turning into rookie development teams after the 1948 season, the AAGPBL was left with eight squads: the Kenosha Comets, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Muskegon Lassies, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The teams competed through a 112-game schedule.\nThis time the league adopted a smaller ball during the midseason, going from to , while the pitching distance increased 50 feet to 55 feet. The transition toward traditional baseball increased significantly. As a result, some talented pitchers jumped up to the rival Chicago National League when they could not adapt to the overhand delivery adopted the previous season. Pitching still outweighed hitting in the league, as no hitter could top the .300 average mark for the year. Rockford's Lois Florreich collected a 0.67 earned run average and South Bend's Jean Faut had a .909 winning percentage, both all-time single season records, while South Bend's Lillian Faralla hurled two no-hitters and Faut added another one for the team.\nThe greatest highlight of the season came from Muskegon's pitcher/outfielder Doris Sams, who won the batting crown with a .279 average and posted a 15–10 record with a 1.58 ERA, to become the first player in league history to win two Player of the Year Awards. She obtained her first distinction in the 1947 season.\nThe South Bend team finished tied in first place along with Rockford. In the first round of the Shaughnessy playoffs, third place Grand Rapids and sixth place Muskegon won their respective best-of-three series against fifth place Fort Wayne and fourth place Kenosha. In the second round, Rockford defeated South Bend in a best-of-seven series and Rockford won over Grand Rapids in a best-of-five series to determine the championship, which was won by Rockford in the final best-of-five series.\nThe AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1947 and 1948 seasons, when the teams attracted almost a million paid fans for consecutive year. But for the first time, the league failed to reach the attendance desired since its foundation in 1943."

Ten laps had to be completed, totalling up to 29.44 kilometre.\nSummary.\nIn the weeks before the race, four favourites emerged: Sven Nys, who has been considered a favourite on about every race since he became a professional, Kevin Pauwels, who had won the World Cup the week before, Zdeněk Štybar, the World Champion of the two previous years and Niels Albert, who had a lousy season, but is known to be great in the sand.\nAlbert started very quickly with Štybar right behind him. However halfway round the first lap Albert was already alone while Štybar got caught up by the pack. A lap later Pauwels had left the others and was gaining on Albert, but never actually got there. Meanwhile, in the background, the five other Belgian riders were together with Štybar hanging at the end of that group.\nBy lap four, Nys had joined Pauwels in the chase on Albert who had kept on widening the gap. Their combined efforts were not enough as the gap kept on growing while from behind the four other Belgians, with an impressive Rob Peeters, were slowly gaining ground. The riders from other countries were nowhere to be seen.\nAlbert kept on going solo till the end and took home his second World Championship title. The chasing group consisted completely of the six other Belgians. Tom Meeusen and Rob Peeters were looking the best, but Meeusen fell in the sand in the last lap. Peeters did keep his stability and got a silver medal, Pauwels completed the podium. Nys ended as the last Belgian, the chase on Albert had destroyed him."

        "text": "Baseball IQ is an American television game show airing on the cable channel MLB Network. The show debuted on January 24, 2012, and its first season ended on February 23, 2012, with the season championship. The show is hosted by MLB Network anchor Matt Vasgersian. The show's focus is baseball trivia.\nFormat.\nThe show features 32 contestants (each of whom works for one of the 30 Major League Baseball teams as well as one from MLB.com and one from the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum) in a bracket-style tournament for up to USD 45,000 for their teams' designated charities. Each episode's winner receives USD 5,000 for the charity and the season champion receives USD 25,000 for the charity. The season runner-up's charity receives USD 15,000.\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay starts with the \"Lead-off Home Run\" question. The player who buzzes in gets the chance to answer. If the player is correct, they score the first run and control of a board with 8 categories to be used in the first 8 rounds (\"innings\"8 or 9 \"innings\" per episode). If the player who buzzes in is incorrect, their opponent gets the first run and control of the board. For the first 8 innings, the player in control picks a category and the subject of a list-based question is given. Players alternate giving answers in the category until one either gives an incorrect answer, repeats a previously given answer, or runs out of time trying to come up with an answer. At that point, the other player wins the inning and is given the option to use their one \"Big Inning\" (each player in each episode gets one) and gives four more answers to earn 2 runs. However if the player uses their Big Inning and fails to get 4 correct answers, he loses the amount of runs he was awarded in the inning. The number of runs for winning the inning outright is determined by how deep the players went in the inning. After 8 innings, if one player is ahead of his opponent by more runs than can be scored in the ninth inning, the \"mercy rule\" goes into effect and no ninth inning is played.\nIn the ninth inning, the two players would bid on the number of correct answers they can give in the final category. If the player who wins the bidding gives the number of correct answers that they bid would score the runs and, if they bid enough, would win the game. If the ninth inning ends in a tie, one more buzz-in question is asked. If the player who buzzes in gets the answer correct, they get the run, win the game, and advance in the tournament. The other player scores and wins if the buzz-in player answers incorrectly.\nThe first tournament was won by Shane Demmitt, representing the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, who defeated Ben Baumer, representing the New York Mets, in the final round."

        "text": "The 1947 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the fifth season of the circuit. The teams Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kenosha Comets, Muskegon Lassies, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox competed through a 112-game schedule. The final Shaugnessy playoffs faced second place Grand Rapids against third place Racine in a Best of Seven Series.\nBy April 1947, all of the league's players were flown to Havana, Cuba for spring training. At the time, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. By then, city ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano than did the Dodgers.\nIn addition to the eight team practices, nearly 55,000 Cuban fans attended a round-robin tournament which took place at Estadio Latinoamericano at the end of the training. The Racine Belles won the tournament and received a commemorative trophy from Esther Williams, American competitive swimmer and MGM movie star.\nAll in all, the rules, strategy and general play were the same in 1947. The sidearm pitching was strictly used, as the league was moving toward full overhand delivery for the next season. The sidearm throwing allowed the hitters more of an advantage than previous seasons. Rockford's Dorothy Kamenshek repeated her batting crown with a .306 batting average in a close race with Audrey Wagner (.305) of Kenosha. Nevertheless, five no-hitters were recorded during the regular season by Racine's Doris Barr, Muskegon Erma Bergmann, Kenosha's Jean Cione, and Rockford's Margaret Holgerson and Betty Luna. The pitching highlight came from Muskegon's Doris Sams, who hurled the third perfect game in league history. In addition, P/OF Sams posted an 11–4 record and a 0.98 earned run average in 19 pitching appearances, while batting a combined average of .280 (97-for-346) in 107 total games. Following the season, Sams was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award.\nAt the end, Grand Rapids, Muskegon and Racine battled for the regular season title, until Muskegon got the victory with just two days remaining the schedule. Muskegon lost to Racine in the first round, three games to one, behind a strong pitching effort from Anna Mae Hutchison, who was credited with all three victories for Racine. By the other side, Grand Rapids defeated South Bend in five games guided by Connie Wisniewski, who pitched a win, stole home plate for another win, and collected an average of .318 (7-for-22).\nThe second round was a tight fight, when the first three contests all went to extra innings and Grand Rapids held a 3–1 advantage in the best of seven series. But the defending champion Racine won the next two games to force a decisive game seven. In a pitching duel, Mildred Earp defeated Hutchison and the Belles on a 1–0, five hit shutout, while driving in the winning run to give Grand Rapids the championship.\nIn 1947 average crowds at AAGPBL games were two to three thousand people, while attendance records were set in Muskegon, Peoria and Racine ballparks ."

        "text": "The 1945 All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season marked the third season of the circuit. The action began with six teams, like the previous season. But the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes franchises were renamed the Grand Rapids Chicks and Fort Wayne Daisies respectively. The measure took effect for poor attendances in the cities of these teams the year before. At this point, the new clubs joined the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, all founding members of the league. The six teams competed through a 110-game schedule, while the split season was dropped in favor of a longer playoff format with the Shaugnessy format: the one seed facing the three seed and the two seed against the four seed. In addition, the pitching distance increased from 40 to 42 feet during the midseason.\nNevertheless, the pitchers continued to dominate the league as an all-time record eight no-hitters were recorded in the season. Rockford's Carolyn Morris hurled a perfect game against Fort Wayne, while South Bend's Betty Luna threw four shutouts in a stretch, including her first career no-hitter. Grand Rapids' Connie Wisniewski led all pitchers with her 32 victories and a 0.81 earned run average, rivalizing with Fort Wayne's Dorothy Wiltse who recorded 29 wins and a 0.83 ERA. But the other side, Mary Nesbitt of Racine was the only hitter to top the .300 mark (.319) while Fort Wayne teammates Helen Callaghan and Faye Dancer tied for the home run title with three a piece. Wisniewski was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award.\nIn the playoffs, champion Rockford played third place Grand Rapids and second place Fort Wayne took Racine. Rockford and Fort Wayne ended up facing each other in the finals, with Rockford becoming the first team to win both the season title and the championship in league history. Morris, who went 28–12 with a 1.08 ERA in the season, defeated the Chicks three times in the first round and repeated her feat against the Daisies in the finals, proving that good pitching is most important that hitting during a short series.\nThe AAGPBL drew 450,000 fans during the 1945 season, which represented a 19 percent raise over the previous year."

It is the fourth oldest golf club in North America having been founded in 1879. The course is ranked 46 in 2010 Scoregolf Top 100 Courses in Canada.\nCourse history.\nThe first course consisted of four holes and was located at what was known as Vinegar Hill. Sometime after 1883 with the popularity of golf growing, the course was moved to Glenmount which is located north of Henry Street and east of West Street. The property is now occupied by Arrowdale Golf Club.\nIn 1906, the course moved to the current site which is located next to Glenhyrst Art Gallery and along the Grand River. The course consisted of 9-holes until 1919 when the membership decided to purchase an additional 69 acres to expand to 18-holes.\nThe 18 holes were principally designed by Nicol Thompson and George Cumming while Stanley Thompson oversaw the project. The course comprised three par-3 holes, three par-5 holes and the remaining holes being par-4. The course stretched 6,300 yards.\nA major redesign was approved in December 1960. C.E Robinson headed the redesign. The course was lengthened to about 6,800 yards, greens were replaced, fairway bunkers were added and the stream was re-routed and widened to create water hazards. The most recently renovations to the course have been completed by Graham Cooke."

He also made it into the semi-finals of the Manchester Open and along the way defeated second-seed Brad Gilbert, in a close three-set match which was decided in a tie break. However his most successful outing in 1992 came at Búzios, where he reached his only ATP Tour singles final.\nHerrera had his third and final Grand Slam win in the 1993 Wimbledon Championships when he came from two sets down to defeat 15th-seed Karel Nováček in the opening round.

        "title": "Bowling for Votes",
        "text": "\"Bowling for Votes\" is the thirteenth episode of the fourth season of the American comedy television series \"Parks and Recreation\", and the 59th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 26, 2012.\nIn the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) has her campaign host a bowling night just to win the vote of a man who does not like her, while the rest of her staff hits the phones to raise money.\nPlot.\nLeslie's (Amy Poehler) campaign holds a focus group about her, and one participant named Derek (Kevin Dorff) says he won't vote for Leslie because she doesn't look like someone he could go bowling with. An offended Leslie becomes determined to win Derek's vote by having her campaign hold a bowling night, although Ben (Adam Scott) tries to explain that there will be voters who simply won't like her. Meanwhile, Jerry (Jim O'Heir) organizes an all-night campaign fundraising event at Andy (Chris Pratt) and April's (Aubrey Plaza) house, with two movie tickets going to the person who raises the most money. Chris (Rob Lowe) wants to win so he can take his girlfriend (Jerry's daughter) Millicent (Sarah Wright) out, and April wants to win just to make the optimistic Chris sad.\nAt the bowling night, Tom (Aziz Ansari) embarrasses Ron (Nick Offerman) and Ann (Rashida Jones) with his childlike bowling technique, but it proves very effective and he scores higher than Ron; Tom later injures his finger when getting his ball and it is unclear if Ron let the accident happen out of jealousy. Leslie challenges Derek to a game of bowling and lets him win while giving him free food and beer. He still refuses to vote for Leslie, angering her and challenging him to a rematch that she wins. An angry Derek calls Leslie a \"bitch\", resulting in Ben punching him. A smitten Leslie kisses Ben over a bloody Derek, of which a newspaper photographer takes a picture.\nChris, who is well in the fundraising lead, announces that he is going to ask Millicent to move in with him, but Jerry privately reveals to everyone else that Millicent is planning to end the relationship; she later shows up and does so, causing Chris to leave. April wins the tickets, but feels guilty that her wish to see Chris sad came true. The next day, she buys a third ticket and offers a depressed Chris to join her and Andy at the movies, giving him a quick hug. Leslie refuses to accept Ben's resignation over the punch and holds a press conference to apologize to Derek, but she tells the reporters that she won't apologize because Derek was a jerk and Ben was right to defend her honor. At a focus group about the press conference, the participants give Leslie very favorable opinions.\nRon later returns to the bowling alley in disguise and tries out Tom's technique, bowling a perfect game.\nReception.\nCritical reaction towards the episode was mostly positive. Christopher Peck of Blast Magazine called the episode \"awesome,\" and drew connections between Leslie's arc in the episode and the show overall. Said Peck, \"No one can ever accuse the ensemble of 'Parks and Recreation' of being inauthentic.\" He ultimately gave the episode an A−. Matt Fowler of IGN liked the episode, especially Ben's punch and the group booing Jerry after Millicent broke up with Chris. But, he did note that Leslie's hyper-focus, just like in the episode \"Citizen Knope\", can be draining. He ultimately gave the episode an 8 out of 10, or a \"Great.\"\nThe episode was viewed by 3.49 million people. This marks not only a decrease from the previous episode, but makes it the lowest-viewed episode of the entire series."

In both 1992 and 1998 he lost in the opening round, to Marc Rosset and Hicham Arazi respectively. However, in the 1997 Wimbledon Championships he reached the third round, with wins over Spanish qualifier Sergi Duran in straight sets and then another Spaniard Juan Albert Viloca, in five sets. He was eliminated by countryman Greg Rusedski in the third round.\nHe was more successful as a doubles player, winning five tournaments on the ATP Challenger Tour. One of those, at Seoul in 1995, was with Tim Henman as his partner. The pair also reached the semi-finals of the 1996 Czech Indoor tournament, an ATP Tour event. Richardson would later be a best man at Henman's wedding.\nIn 1997, Richardson represented an understrength Great Britain Davis Cup team against Zimbabwe. He defeated Byron Black in a singles match, to level the tie at 1–1 but his second match, against Byron's brother Wayne, which Richardson lost, was a dead-rubber, with Zimbabwe having already secured the tie.\nHe is now a tennis coach and has worked with British players Ross Hutchins, Miles Kasiri, Alan Mackin and Emma Raducanu. Richardson worked with Raducanu during the 2021 US Open, in which she became the first qualifier to win a grand slam title, and the first British woman to do so since Virginia Wade's Wimbledon title in 1977."

        "text": "Matthew Allen Campbell (born November 29, 1979) is an American college football coach. He is the head football coach at Iowa State University, a position he has held since the 2016 season. Campbell was head football coach at the University of Toledo from 2011 to 2015. Prior to that, Campbell had been an assistant at Toledo, Bowling Green, and Mount Union. Campbell grew up in Ohio and briefly attended the University of Pittsburgh before transferring to Mount Union, where he played defensive line.\nPlaying career.\nCampbell was born in Massillon, Ohio. His father Rick coached football at Jackson High School. Matt played football at rival Perry, which won three conference championships while he was on the team. Campbell initially attended the University of Pittsburgh on an athletic scholarship in 1998, but transferred to the University of Mount Union after a year. At Mount Union, Campbell played on the defensive line between 1999 and 2002. At Mount Union, Campbell played for head coach Larry Kehres, whose teams won three Division III championships during Campbell's career. Campbell himself was twice named to the College Football All-America Team and named Ohio Athletic Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year.\nCoaching career.\nAfter college, Campbell stayed within Ohio and took a job as a graduate assistant at Bowling Green State University from 2003 to 2004. While at Bowling Green Scott Pioli, then the director of player personnel for the New England Patriots, offered Campbell an interview for a job at the team, but Campbell declined. Campbell returned to Mount Union for 2005–2006 as offensive coordinator; Mount Union won the Division III championship both years. Campbell then went back to Bowling Green for two years, first as offensive line coach (2007) and then as offensive line coach/run game coordinator (2008). The University of Toledo hired him as the run game coordinator for the 2009 season. This move reunited him with head coach Tim Beckman, defensive coordinator at Bowling Green during Campbell's first stint there.\nToledo.\nToledo promoted Campbell to offensive coordinator in 2010. Toledo made Campbell the permanent head coach at the end of 2011 when Beckman departed for the University of Illinois. He was 32 years old and the youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Two weeks into the job, Toledo defeated Air Force in the Military Bowl. Reportedly Campbell passed on a chance to serve on Urban Meyer's staff at Ohio State University. Campbell coached four full seasons at Toledo: 2012–2015, amassing a record of 35–15. The 2015 team peaked at 19 in the AP Poll, including a victory over Arkansas.\nIowa State.\nIowa State University named Campbell its head coach on November 29, 2015, his 36th birthday, replacing the fired Paul Rhoads. Campbell signed a six-year, $22.5 million extension with the school on November 27, 2017. Campbell was named the Big 12 Coach of the Year twice. In his second year, Campbell led Iowa State to an 8–5 season that included wins against #3 Oklahoma and #4 TCU. Iowa State won their bowl game that year against the Memphis Tigers in the Liberty Bowl. During his third year at Iowa State, he led the Cyclones to a second 8–5 season. This included a 6–3 record in Big 12 play, their most conference wins in history. In 2018, Campbell was reportedly requested for an interview for the New York Jets NFL team, however, he declined the interview.\nIn the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Campbell led the Cyclones to their best season in decades. The Cyclones finished in first place in the Big 12, their first regular-season first-place finish of any sort in 119 years. However, they lost the Big 12 title game to Oklahoma. They were selected for the 2021 Fiesta Bowl, the first major-bowl appearance in school history, and defeated Oregon 34–17. They finished ninth in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history.\nOn February 8, 2021, Iowa State announced a new contract extension for Campbell through the 2028 season. It was reported that Campbell was offered an eight-year, $68.5 million deal by the Detroit Lions for their head coaching position in 2021, but other reports said that the Lions never put an offer on the table.\nPersonal life.\nIn the summer of 2022, Campbell served as the head coach of the Gilbert 6th grade softball team. The team rallied from a 4–2 third inning deficit to defeat Roland-Story in the championship game. He has four children with his wife, Erica."

        "text": "The 2013 Rose Bowl, the 99th edition of the annual game, was a college football bowl game played on Tuesday, January 1, 2013, at the same-named stadium in Pasadena, California. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association is the organizer of the game. The game matched Big Ten Conference Champions Wisconsin Badgers against the Pac-12 Conference Champions Stanford Cardinal, a rematch of the same two teams in the 2000 Rose Bowl. The Cardinal defeated the Badgers 20–14 for the Rose Bowl Championship. This was Wisconsin's third consecutive Rose Bowl defeat.\nBecause of sponsorship by Vizio, the first game in the 2013 edition of the Bowl Championship Series was officially titled the Rose Bowl Game presented by Vizio. The contest was televised on ESPN with a radio broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which began at 1:30 PM (PST) with kickoff at 2:10 PM (PST).\nThe Rose Bowl Game, themed \"Oh, the Places You'll Go!\", was a contractual sell-out, with 64,500 tickets allocated to the participating teams and conferences. The remaining tickets went to the Tournament of Roses members, sponsors, City of Pasadena residents, and the general public.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 2013 Rose Queen Vanessa Manjarrez, the Royal Court (Madison Teodo, Sonia Shenoi, Kathryne Benuska, Nicole Nelam, Tracy Cresta, and Victoria McGregor), Tournament of Roses President Sally Bixby, and Grand Marshal Jane Goodall.\nAfter the teams' arrival in Southern California, the teams participated in the traditional Lawry's Beef Bowl in Beverly Hills and the Disney Media Day at Disneyland in nearby Anaheim. The Rose Bowl Hall of Fame ceremony luncheon was held prior to the game at the Pasadena Convention Center.\nThe bands and cheerleaders from both schools participated in the pre-game Rose Parade on Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena, California along with the floats.\nA USAF B-2 of the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base performed a fly-over at the end of the National Anthem before the game.\nTeams.\nTeams playing in the Rose Bowl game are typically the winners of the Pac-12 and Big Ten conferences (each of which currently determines this by means of a conference championship game), unless one team (or both teams) plays in the BCS National Championship game. The teams were officially selected by the football committee of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association on Selection Sunday on December 2, 2012. Also former ABC college football announcer Keith Jackson announced the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Class of 2012 inductees John Cooper, Brian Griese and Ron Yary. Both teams held their pre-game practices at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California. Prior to the game, the two teams had met five times with the Badgers leading the series 4–0–1.\nStanford.\nStanford, representing the North Division in the Pac-12 Football Championship Game, defeated UCLA, the South Division Champions 27–24 to earn a trip to Pasadena.\nThe Cardinal last played in the 2000 Rose Bowl, also against the Wisconsin Badgers, losing 17–9.\nThe Cardinal led the Pac-12 Conference in scoring defense (17.5 per game), rushing defense (87.7 yards per game), sacks (56), and kickoff coverage. Running back Stepfan Taylor rushed 302 times for 1442 yards with 12 touchdowns, averaging 110.9 yards per game.\nWisconsin.\nThe Wisconsin Badgers, representing the Leaders Division in the 2012 Big Ten Championship Game, defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers, the Legends Division Champions 70–31 to earn their third consecutive trip to the game. Wisconsin lost to the TCU Horned Frogs 21–19 in 2011 and to the Oregon Ducks 45–38 in 2012. Head coach Bret Bielema accepted the head coaching position at Arkansas prior to the game. Wisconsin was coached in the Rose Bowl by Bielema's predecessor and former athletic director Barry Alvarez, a member of both the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. He was the coach of the 1999 Wisconsin Badgers football team that defeated Stanford in the 2000 Rose Bowl and, prior to this game, had never lost a Rose Bowl (3–0).\nRunning back Montee Ball rushed for 1,730 yards and 21 touchdowns on the season. He had nine 100-yard rushing games including two 200-yard rushing performances this season. His career 76 rushing touchdowns and 82 total touchdowns are both NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision records, and his 25 career games with multiple touchdowns equals the previous FBS record of Travis Prentice (who was also the prior holder of the two records broken by Ball). Ball is the 2012 Doak Walker Award winner.\nGame summary.\nScoring.\nStanford 20 Wisconsin 14"

Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the league created a hybrid game that included both softball and baseball.\nThe league underwent a name change during the season: It began as the All-American Girls Softball League., but midway through the 1943 season, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL).\nThe AAGPBL began with a 12-inch softball but incorporated baseball rules. The new league started with four teams, the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The teams competed through a 108-game schedule, while the first Scholarship Series faced first-half winner Racine against Kenosha, second-half champ, in a Best of Five Series.\nThe strong pitching led to low batting averages, as the league hit a collective .230 average with Racine topping the chart (.246). Just one player, Rockford's Gladys Davis, reached the .300 mark. Only 72 home runs were batted for the four teams. Ten of these homers came from the bat of Eleanor Dapkus with Racine.\nKenosha pitcher Helen Nicol won the Triple Crown with 31 wins, 220 strikeouts and a 1.81 earned run average, and also led the league in winning percentage (.795), consecutive wins (13), complete games (33), shutouts (8) and innings pitched (348). The best individual pitching performance on the year came from Rockford's Olive Little, who hurled the first no-hitter in league history.\nIn the final series, Racine swept Kenosha in three games to win the first title of the league. Irene Hickson led the Belles with a .417 average, while pitcher Mary Nesbitt won two complete-game victories and relieved Joanne Winter in her win.\nThe AAGPBL drew 176,000 fans during its inaugural season, which assured the league would continue the following year."

        "title": "Collegiate Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The Collegiate Rugby Championship (CRC) is an annual college rugby sevens tournament. The CRC began as the highest profile college rugby sevens competition in the United States, with the tournament broadcast live on NBC from 2010 to 2017, on ESPN News and ESPN3 from 2018 to 2019, The Rugby Network in 2021 and 2023, and on CBS Sports in 2022. The CRC capitalized on the surge in popularity of rugby at major universities following the 2009 announcement of the addition of rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics. Beginning in 2021, the tournament has been organized by National Collegiate Rugby (NCR) under license for the name and logo. Since the CRC franchise was licensed to NCR, the tournament has primarily featured comparatively smaller universities, as USA Rugby, recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the sport's National Governing Body (NGB), holds the official championship in June, 2024. \nFormat and qualifying.\nThe tournament has expanded since 16 sides were featured in the inaugural competition, with 32 men's sides competing in the 2021 tournament. The competition has been played over the course of either two or three days. The first day of the tournament features pool matches, with the top teams in each group advancing to the quarterfinals, along with the best second-placed teams. The final day of the tournament is knockout play, featuring the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals.\nThe majority of the participating teams are invited to the tournament based on the quality of the school's rugby program and on the school's fan appeal. Certain teams also qualify by winning the Southeastern Rugby Conference, the Las Vegas Invitational, and the new Heart of America Tournament.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural 2010 Collegiate Rugby Championship, at the time known as the Collegiate Championship Invitational (CCI), was held in Columbus, Ohio, at the Columbus Crew Stadium. Utah defeated Cal 31–26 in overtime in a thrilling final. Bowling Green's Rocco Mauer led the tournament with 11 tries and was named tournament MVP by Rugby Mag.\nThe 2011 Collegiate Rugby Championship moved to PPL Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. NBC increased their coverage over the previous year, devoting 14 hours of coverage to the tournament. California and Arizona were favored after cruising to victories in the first day of pool play, but both were knocked out in quarterfinal upsets. Ultimately, Dartmouth beat Army 32–10 in the final.\nDue to the strong support from Philadelphia fans and its Pennsylvania-based title sponsorship, Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, the CRC remained in Philadelphia until 2021, when it moved to New Orleans. The Gold Mine on Airline again hosted the tournament for the 2022 edition, with television coverage provided by CBS Sports. Having previously been held in late Spring, the 2023 tournament was moved to late April and the venue once again changed to the Maryland SoccerPlex in the Washington, D.C. metro area.\nPopularity.\nThe Collegiate Rugby Championship initially succeeded in drawing media attention. NBC recognized that rugby was growing in popularity, participation and interest, and NBC's broadcast of the inaugural 2010 CRC was the first time college rugby had been broadcast live on network TV in the US. The honor of first collegiate try ever scored on broadcast TV belongs to Evan Kaufman of Indiana University. NBC Sports Programming President, Jon Miller, described NBC's support of the Collegiate Rugby Championship, \"We're hoping to see continued growth in the ratings and the attendance. We like the sport a lot, and we've given it a great time period and a real plumb (\"sic\") position on our schedule.\"\nTournaments broadcast by NBC posted respectable TV ratings, with the TV audience larger than that of the NCAA lacrosse championships.\nDue in part to the exposure from NBC's broadcasts, the tournament attracted several blue chip corporate sponsors, including Geico, Subway, Toyota and Bud Light. The CRC is popular with fans, with over 17,000 fans turning out to watch the 2011 tournament, and over 18,000 fans in attendance at the 2012 tournament. This was followed by a twenty-two percent increase in attendance from 2014 to 2015 totaling 24,813 and an even further increase in 2016 to a total attendance of 27,224. In September 2014, Penn Mutual life insurance company announced a multi-year title sponsorship of the annual championship, which led to the tournament being renamed to the Penn Mutual Collegiate Rugby Championship.\nThe Collegiate Rugby Championship sparked a mini revolution in college rugby, prompting scores of schools to begin offering a rugby sevens program. One of the schools that benefited from the publicity generated by the CRC tournament has been the University of Texas. Following Texas' participation in the CRC, Texas \"raised an additional $10,000 from alumni, landed a new apparel sponsor, and have been contacted by 90 students (including two DBs from the football team) who want to play rugby.\" The CRC has also given a boost of exposure to lesser known schools with strong rugby programs. For example, when Life University went undefeated in pool play and reached the semifinals of the June 2–3 2012 CRC, Life University's Wikipedia page was viewed by 9,800 people that weekend.\nRivalries.\nDespite the fact that the CRC tournament has only been around since 2010, the tournament has seen some notable rivalries:\nNotable Past Players and Coaches.\nThe Collegiate Rugby Championship has been notable for its ability to showcase the emerging stars of US rugby. In 2012, representatives from all 12 clubs in the English Premiership (the top professional league in England) attended the CRC, where the Premiership coaches scouted talent from the 16 university teams competing.\nThe following athletes who have starred in the CRC and made the All Tournament team have gone on to play for the United States national rugby sevens team or United States national rugby union team in international competitions:\nAlex Magleby, who became head coach of the United States national rugby sevens team in 2012, was previously head coach of Dartmouth, the team he coached to victory at the 2011 Collegiate Rugby Championship and 2012 Collegiate Rugby Championship."

        "title": "Professional golf career of Tiger Woods",
        "text": " \nAmerican professional golfer Tiger Woods has enjoyed one of the most successful golfing careers of all time. After competing in amateur events since he was a toddler and representing Stanford University on a golf scholarship, Woods left college after two years to turn professional at the age of 20.\n1996–1998: Early years and first major win.\nWith the announcement \"Hello, World.\" Tiger Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996 and signed endorsement deals worth $40 million from Nike, Inc. and $20 million from Titleist. These endorsement contracts were the highest in golf history up to that point. He played his first professional golf event at the Greater Milwaukee Open, tying for 60th place, recorded a hole-in-one, and would win two events in the next three months to qualify for the Tour Championship. For his efforts, Woods was named \"Sports Illustrated\"'s 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. He began his tradition of wearing a red shirt during the final round of tournaments, which was a link to his college days at Stanford.\nThe following April, Woods won his first major, The Masters, with a record score of 18-under-par 270, by a record margin of 12 strokes. The landmark victory made Woods the tournament's youngest-ever winner, as well as its first African-American winner (and its first Asian-American winner). Woods set 20 Masters records in 1997 and tied six others. He went on to win another three PGA Tour events that year, and on June 15, 1997, in only his 42nd week as a professional, rose to number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, the fastest-ever ascent to world No. 1. At the conclusion of the 1997 season, Woods was named PGA Player of the Year, the first time a golfer had won the award in just his second year as a professional.\nWhile expectations for Woods were high, his play faded in the second half of 1997, and in 1998 he only won a single PGA Tour event. He answered critics of his \"slump\" and what seemed to be wavering form by maintaining he was undergoing extensive swing changes with his coach, Butch Harmon, and was hoping to do better in the future.\n1999–2002: Slams.\nIn June 1999, Woods won the Memorial Tournament, a victory that touched off one of the greatest sustained periods of dominance in the history of men's golf. He completed his 1999 campaign by winning his last four starts —- including the PGA Championship -— and finished the season with eight wins, a feat not achieved since 1974. Woods was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year and Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the second time in three years.\nPicking up where he had left off in 1999, Woods started 2000 with his fifth consecutive victory and began a record-setting season. He extended his win streak to six at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February with a memorable comeback—trailing by seven strokes with seven holes to play, he finished eagle-birdie-par-birdie for a 64 and a two-stroke victory. His six consecutive wins were the most since Ben Hogan in 1948. At his next tournament, the Buick Invitational, he finished tied for second, breaking the streak, but earned enough money to put him at the top of the PGA Tour's career money list, a position he has held ever since. In the 2000 U.S. Open, he broke or tied nine U.S. Open records with his 15-stroke win, including Old Tom Morris's record for the largest victory margin ever in a major championship, which had stood since 1862. He led by a record ten strokes going into the final round, and \"Sports Illustrated\" called it \"the greatest performance in golf history.\" In the 2000 Open Championship at St Andrews, which he won by eight strokes, he set the record for lowest score to par (−19) in any major tournament, and Woods at one time held at least a share of that record in all four major championships (since eclipsed by Rory McIlroy's −16 at the 2011 U.S. Open and Jason Day's −20 at the 2015 PGA Championship). At 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.\nWoods's major championship streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 PGA Championship, when Bob May went head-to-head with Woods on Sunday at Valhalla Golf Club. However, Woods played the last twelve holes of regulation seven under par, and won a three-hole aggregate playoff over May with a birdie on the first hole and pars on the next two. He joined Ben Hogan (1953) as the only other player to win three professional majors in one season. Three weeks later, he won his third straight start on Tour at the Bell Canadian Open, becoming only the second man after Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the Triple Crown of Golf (U.S., British, and Canadian Opens) in one year. By the end of Woods' 2000 campaign, he had won three consecutive majors, nine PGA Tour events, and had set or tied 27 Tour records. Of the twenty events he entered, he finished in the top three fourteen times. His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 and his actual scoring average of 68.17 were the lowest in PGA Tour history, besting his own record of 68.43 in 1999 and Byron Nelson's average of 68.33 in 1945. He was named the 2000 \"Sports Illustrated\" Sportsman of the Year, becoming the first athlete to be honored twice, a feat that was matched by LeBron James in 2016. Woods was ranked as the twelfth best golfer of all time by \"Golf Digest\" magazine just four years after he turned professional.\nThe following season, Woods continued to dominate. His 2001 Masters Tournament win marked the only time in the modern era of the Grand Slam that any player has held all four major championship titles at the same time, a feat now known as the \"Tiger Slam\". It is not viewed as a true Grand Slam, however, because it was not achieved in a calendar year. Surprisingly, he was not a factor in the three remaining majors of the year, but finished with the most PGA Tour wins in the season, with five. In 2002, he started strongly, joining Nick Faldo (1989–90) and Jack Nicklaus (1965–66) as the only men to have won back-to-back Masters Tournaments.\nTwo months later, Woods was the only player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the calendar Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. All eyes were on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes in the final round cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.\n2003–2004: Swing adjustments.\nThe next phase of Woods's career saw him remain among the top competitors on the tour, but lose his dominating edge. He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004, falling to second in the PGA Tour money list in 2003 and fourth in 2004. Nevertheless, he was named 2003 PGA Player of the Year and PGA Tour Player of the Year after winning two World Golf Championships and finishing fourth at the Open Championship.\nIn September 2004, his record streak of 264 consecutive weeks as the world's top-ranked golfer ended at the Deutsche Bank Championship, when Vijay Singh won and overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Ranking.\nMany commentators were puzzled by Woods's \"slump,\" offering explanations that ranged from his rift with swing coach Butch Harmon to his engagement and marriage. At the same time, he let it be known that he was again working on changes to his swing, this time in hopes of reducing the wear and tear on his surgically repaired left knee, which was subjected to severe stress in the 1998–2003 version of his swing. Again, he anticipated that once the adjustments were complete, he would return to his previous form. Woods changed coaches, working with Hank Haney after leaving Harmon.\n2005–2007: Resurgence.\nIn the 2005 season, Woods quickly returned to his winning ways. He won the Buick Invitational in January, and in March he outplayed Phil Mickelson to win the Ford Championship at Doral and temporarily return to the Official World Golf Ranking number one position (Singh displaced him once again two weeks later). In April, he finally broke his \"drought\" in the majors by winning the 2005 Masters Tournament in a playoff, which regained him the number one spot in the World Rankings. Singh and Woods swapped the #1 position several times over the next couple of months, but by early July Woods had reclaimed the top spot, propelled further by a victory at the 2005 Open Championship, his 10th major. He went on to win six official money events on the PGA Tour in 2005, topping the money list for the sixth time in his career. His 2005 wins also included two at the World Golf Championships.\nFor Woods, the year 2006 was markedly different from 2005. While he began just as dominantly (winning the first two PGA tournaments he entered on the year) and was in the hunt for his fifth Masters championship in April, he never mounted a Sunday charge to defend his title, allowing Phil Mickelson to claim the green jacket.\nDeath of father.\nOn May 3, 2006, Woods's father, mentor and inspiration, Earl, died at age 74 after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer. Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the PGA Tour to be with his family. When he returned for the 2006 U.S. Open, the rust was evident—he missed the cut at Winged Foot, the first time he had missed the cut at a major as a professional, and ended his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at majors. Still, a tie for second at the Western Open just three weeks later showed him poised to defend his Open Championship crown at Hoylake.\nReturns to top form.\nAt the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost exclusively used long irons off the tee (he hit driver only one time the entire week—the 16th hole of the first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.\nFour weeks later at the 2006 PGA Championship, Woods again won in dominating fashion, making only three bogeys, tying the record for fewest in a major. He finished the tournament at 18-under-par, equaling the to-par record in the PGA that he shares with Bob May from 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). In August 2006, he won his 50th professional tournament at the Buick Open—and at the age of thirty years and seven months, he became the youngest golfer to do so. He ended the year by winning six consecutive PGA Tour events, and won the three most prestigious awards given by the PGA Tour (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Byron Nelson Awards) in the same year for a record seventh time.\nAt the close of his first 11 seasons, Woods's 54 wins and 12 major wins had surpassed the all-time eleven-season PGA Tour total win record of 51 (set by Byron Nelson) and total majors record of 11 (set by Jack Nicklaus). He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for a record-tying fourth time.\nWoods and tennis star Roger Federer, who share a major sponsor, first met at the 2006 U.S. Open tennis final. Since then, they have attended each other's events and have voiced their mutual appreciation for each other's talents.\nWoods began 2007 with a two-stroke victory at the Buick Invitational for his third straight win at the event and his seventh consecutive win on the PGA Tour. The victory marked the fifth time he had won his first tournament of the season. With this win, he became the third man (after Jack Nicklaus and Sam Snead) to win at least five times in three different events on the PGA Tour (his two other events are the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and WGC-CA Championship). He earned his second victory of the year at the WGC-CA Championship for his third consecutive and sixth overall win at the event. With this victory, he became the first player to have three consecutive victories in five different events.\nAt the 2007 Masters Tournament, Woods was in the final group on the last day of a major for the thirteenth time in his career, but unlike the previous twelve occasions, he was unable to come away with the win. He finished tied for second two strokes behind winner Zach Johnson.\nWoods earned his third victory of the season by two strokes at the Wachovia Championship, the 24th different PGA Tour tournament he won. He has collected at least three wins in a season nine times in his 12-year career. At the U.S. Open, he was in the final group for the fourth consecutive major championship, but began the day two strokes back and finished tied for second once again. His streak of never having come from behind to win on the final day of a major continued.\nIn search of a record-tying fourth consecutive Open Championship, Woods fell out of contention with a second-round 75, and never mounted a charge over the weekend. Although his putting was solid (he sank a 90-footer in the first round), his iron play held him back. \"I wasn't hitting the ball as close as I needed to all week,\" he said, after he finished tied for twelfth, five strokes off the pace.\nIn early August, Woods won his record 14th World Golf Championships event at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational by 8 strokes for his third consecutive and sixth victory overall at the event. He became the first golfer to win the same event three straight times on two different occasions (1999–2001) and (2005–2007). The following week, he won his second straight PGA Championship by defeating Woody Austin by two strokes. He became the first golfer to win the PGA Championship in back-to-back seasons on two different occasions: 1999–2000 and 2006–2007. He became the second golfer, after Sam Snead, to have won at least five events on the PGA Tour in eight different seasons.\nWoods earned his 60th PGA Tour victory at the BMW Championship by shooting a course record 63 in the final round to win by two strokes. He sank a fifty-foot putt in the final round and missed only two fairways on the weekend. He led the field in most birdies for the tournament, and ranked in the top five in driving accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, putts per green, and greens in regulation. Woods finished his 2007 season with a runaway victory at the Tour Championship to capture his fourth title in his last five starts of the year. He became the only two-time winner of the event, and the champion of the inaugural FedEx Cup. In his 16 starts on Tour in 2007, his adjusted scoring average was 67.79, matching his own record set in 2000. His substantial leads over the second, third, and fourth players were similar in 2000 (1.46 (Phil Mickelson), 1.52 (Ernie Els), 1.66 (David Duval)) and 2007 (1.50 (Els), 1.51 (Justin Rose), 1.60 (Steve Stricker)).\n2008: Injury-shortened season.\nWoods started the 2008 season with an eight-stroke victory at the Buick Invitational. The win marked his 62nd PGA Tour victory, tying him with Arnold Palmer for fourth on the all-time list. This marked his sixth victory at the event, the sixth time he has begun the PGA Tour season with a victory, and his third PGA Tour win in a row. The following week, he was trailing by four strokes going into the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic, but made six birdies on the back nine for a dramatic one-stroke victory. He took home his 15th World Golf Championships event at the Accenture Match Play Championship with a record-breaking 8 &amp; 7 victory in the final.\nIn his next event, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Woods got off to a slow start, finishing the first round at even par and tied for 34th place. After finishing the third round in a five-way tie for first place, he completed his fifth consecutive PGA Tour victory with a dramatic putt on the 18th hole to defeat Bart Bryant by a stroke. It was also his fifth career victory in this event. Geoff Ogilvy stopped Woods's run at the WGC-CA Championship, a tournament Woods had won in each of the previous three years. He remains the only golfer to have had more than one streak of at least five straight wins on the PGA Tour.\nDespite bold predictions that Woods might again challenge for the Grand Slam, he did not mount a serious charge at the 2008 Masters Tournament, struggling with his putter through each round. He would still finish alone in second, three strokes behind the champion, Trevor Immelman. On April 15, 2008, he underwent his third left knee arthroscopic surgery in Park City, Utah, and missed two months on the PGA Tour. The first surgery he had was in 1994, when he had a benign tumor removed, and the second in December 2002. He was named \"Men's Fitness\"'s Fittest Athlete in the June/July 2008 issue.\nWoods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open in one of the most anticipated golf groupings in history including Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott, the top three golfers in the world. Woods struggled the first day, notching a double bogey on his first hole. He would end the round at +1 (72), four shots off the lead. He scored −3 (68) his second day, still paired with Mickelson, managing 5 birdies, 1 eagle and 4 bogeys. On the third day of the tournament, he began with a double bogey once again and was trailing by five shots with six holes to play. However, he finished the round by making two eagle putts, a combined in length, and a chip-in birdie to take a one-shot lead into the final round. His final putt assured that he would be in the final group for the sixth time in the last eight major championships.\nOn Sunday, June 15, Woods began the day with another double bogey, and trailed Rocco Mediate by one stroke after 71 holes. He winced after several of his tee shots, and sometimes made an effort to keep weight off his left foot. Woods was behind by one stroke when he reached the final hole. Left with a putt for birdie, he sank it to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate on Monday. Despite leading by as many as three strokes at one point in the playoff, Woods again dropped back and needed to birdie the 18th to force sudden death with Mediate, and did so. Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said \"This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination,\" and Kenny Perry added, \"He beat everybody on one leg.\" His third win in the U.S. Open tied him with Bobby Jones for the career lead in USGA championships won, with nine.\nTwo days after winning the U.S. Open, Woods announced that he would be required to undergo reconstructive anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery on his left knee and would miss the remainder of the 2008 golf season, including the final two major championships: The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. Woods also revealed that he had been playing for at least ten months with a torn ligament in his left knee, and sustained a double stress fracture in his left tibia while rehabbing after the surgery he had after the Masters. Publications throughout the world asserted his U.S. Open victory as \"epic\" and praised his efforts, especially after learning of the extent of his knee injury. Woods called it \"My greatest ever championship – the best of the 14 because of all the things that have gone on over the past week.\"\nWoods' absence from the remainder of the season caused PGA Tour television ratings to decline. Overall viewership for the second half of the 2008 season saw a 46.8% decline as compared to 2007.\n2009: Returning to the PGA Tour.\nCalled \"one of the most anticipated returns in sports\" by the Associated Press, Woods' first PGA Tour event after an eight-month layoff came at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. He lost to Tim Clark in the second round. His first stroke play event was the WGC-CA Championship at Doral, where he finished 9th (−11). Woods won his first title of the year at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he was five strokes behind Sean O'Hair entering the final round. Woods shot a final round 67 and made a birdie putt at the final hole to defeat O'Hair by one stroke. Afterwards, he would continue to perform consistently. At The Masters, he finished sixth, four strokes behind eventual winner Ángel Cabrera. Then, despite having the 18-hole lead at the Quail Hollow Championship, he finished two strokes behind Sean O'Hair. At The Players Championship, he played in the final group on Sunday, but finished eighth.\nWoods won his second event of 2009 at the Memorial Tournament. He trailed by four shots after three rounds but shot a final round 65, which included two consecutive birdies to end the tournament. The win was Woods' fourth at the event. Woods won his third event of the 2009 season on July 5 at the AT&amp;T National, an event hosted by Woods himself. However, for the third time going into a 2009 major, Woods failed to capitalize on his preceding win. Instead, at the 2009 Open Championship, played at Turnberry, he missed the cut for only the second time in a major championship since turning professional.\nOn August 2, Woods captured the Buick Open for his fourth win of the season, with a three-shot victory over three other players. After firing an opening-round 71 that put him in 95th place and outside of the cutline, Woods responded with a second-round 63, nine-under-par, that vaulted him into contention. A third-round 65 put him atop the leaderboard and he coasted to victory with a final-round 69 for a 20-under 268 four-round total. This was his biggest turnaround pro victory to date.\nWoods won his 70th career event the following week at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. He went head-to-head against Pádraig Harrington on Sunday until the 16th, where Harrington made a triple-bogey-8 on the par-5 hole, and Woods made birdie. Tiger went on to win the event by four strokes over Harrington and Robert Allenby.\nAt the 2009 PGA Championship, Woods shot a 5-under 67 to take the lead after the first round. He remained leader or co-leader through the second and third rounds. Going into the final round, Woods had a 2-stroke lead at 8-under. However, at the 68th hole, Woods was overtaken for the first time atop the leaderboard by Yang Yong-eun. Yang eventually won the tournament by three strokes over Woods, who finished second. It marked the first time that Woods failed to win a major when leading or co-leading after 54 holes, and the first time he had lost any tournament on American soil when leading by more than one shot. It also meant that Woods would end the year without a major for the first time since 2004.\nWoods won his 71st career title at the BMW Championship. The win moved him to first place in the FedEx Cup standings going into the final playoff event. It was his fifth win at the BMW Championship (including three wins as the Western Open) and marked the fifth time he had won an event five or more times in his career on the PGA Tour. Woods finished second at The Tour Championship to capture his second FedEx Cup title.\nAt the 2009 Presidents Cup, Woods had a spectacular performance, winning all five of his matches at the event. He joined his friend Mark O'Meara, who won all five of his matches at the 1996 Presidents Cup, and Shigeki Maruyama, who accomplished this feat in the 1998 Presidents Cup. In all three instances, their respective teams won the competition. Woods was paired with Steve Stricker for all four partners' rounds of the competition, in foursomes and four-ball. On the first day of foursomes, they won 6 and 4 over the team of Ryo Ishikawa and Geoff Ogilvy. In Friday's match of four-ball, they won over the team of Ángel Cabrera and Geoff Ogilvy, 5 and 3. On Saturday, they beat the team of Tim Clark and Mike Weir after trailing for most of the match, by winning the 17th and 18th holes to win 1-up in morning foursomes, and in the afternoon four-ball they defeated the team of Ryo Ishikawa and Y. E. Yang by the score of 4 and 2. In the singles match, Woods was paired with his nemesis from the 2009 PGA Championship, Yang. Yang grabbed the quick 1-up lead on the first hole, but on the third hole lost the lead and Woods went on to win the match by a score of 6 and 5. In addition, Woods clinched the Cup for the United States, which was the first time ever in his career he had the honor and opportunity to do this in a team event competition.\nIn November 2009, Woods was paid $3.3 million to play in the JBWere Masters, held at Kingston Heath in Melbourne, Australia from November 12 to 15. The event was sold out for the first time. He went on to win at 14 under par, two strokes over Australian Greg Chalmers, marking his 38th European Tour win and his first win on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n2010: Turbulent, winless season.\nAfter his past marital infidelities became known, with massive worldwide media coverage which would eventually last for several months, Woods announced an indefinite break from competitive golf at the end of 2009. He apologized for his behaviour at a news conference held at PGA Tour headquarters on Feb. 19; the statement received live network coverage. In March 2010, he announced that he would be playing in the 2010 Masters.\nMissing the start of the 2010 season, Woods returned to competition for the 2010 Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia, starting on April 8, 2010, after a break lasting nearly 20 weeks. He began with a 4-under-par round of 68, his best ever start at the Masters, and remained in contention until nearly the end of the fourth day, eventually finishing the tournament tied for fourth. Woods next competed at the 2010 Quail Hollow Championship at the end of April, but missed the cut for just the sixth time of his career. He shot his second-worst round as a professional on April 30, a 7-over 79 during the second round to miss the 36-hole cut by eight strokes. Woods withdrew from The Players Championship during the fourth round, on May 9, later citing a neck injury. He had scored 70-71-71 in the first three rounds, and was two over par for the round, while playing the seventh hole, when he withdrew. Hank Haney, who had coached Woods since 2003, issued a statement resigning as his coach shortly after The Players Championship.\nWoods returned to competitive golf four weeks later to defend his title at the Memorial Tournament. He made the cut and went on to finish T19, his worst finish in that tournament since 2002. His next competitive tournament began June 17 at the U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach, the site of his 2000 win by a record 15 shots. After a relatively unspectacular performance through the first two rounds, Woods showed signs of his pre-2010 form, as he managed a back nine 31 en route to shooting a five-under-par 66 on Saturday, which would tie for the low round of the tournament and put him back into contention. However, he was unable to mount a charge on Sunday, despite the collapse of 54-hole leader Dustin Johnson, and went on to finish the tournament at three-over-par and in a tie for fourth place, repeating his top-5 result at the 2010 Masters Tournament.\nWoods then played in the AT&amp;T National in late June, which he had formerly hosted, before AT&amp;T dropped his personal sponsorship. He was the defending champion, and the favorite among many, but he struggled all four days of the tournament, failed to post a round under par, and tied for 46th place.\nWoods then flew to Ireland to play in a two-day charity event, the JP McManus Pro-Am, and then flew home to Florida to \"see his kids\", before preparing for The Open Championship just over a week later. He changed his putter for the Open Championship at St Andrews Old Course, saying he always struggled on slow greens and needed this new Nike Method 001 putter to \"get the ball rolling faster and better\". This was a somewhat surprising statement, considering he had won the previous two Open Championships held at St Andrews, in 2000 and 2005. It was the first time Woods had used any other putter than his Titleist Scotty Cameron since 1999. Woods putted well the first day of the tournament, shooting a 5-under 67, but wind gusts of over 40 mph suspended play for 66 minutes the next day at St Andrews, and Woods was never able to get anything going. It was the same story Saturday. He repeatedly missed short putts. He changed his putter back to his old Scotty Cameron for the final round, but did not putt any better. Woods finished 3-under overall, 13 shots behind winner Louis Oosthuizen (tied for 23rd place).\nWoods finished in 18-over par, tying for 78th place (second-to-last place) in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on August 8. He posted his worst four-round result as a professional golfer.\nWoods began working with Canadian golf coach Sean Foley in August 2010; the two had been discussing a possible partnership for several previous weeks. In the 2010 PGA Championship, played at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, Woods made the 36-hole cut but failed to mount a challenge, ending in a tie for 28th place.\nWoods's inconsistent play in the 2010 FedEx Cup playoffs failed to qualify him into the top 30 players for The Tour Championship, for the first time since he turned professional in 1996. He had won the FedEx Cup in 2007 and 2009. He also failed to qualify on points for the 2010 Ryder Cup team, for the first time in his career. But captain Corey Pavin chose Woods as one of his four captain's picks. Woods, again partnering with Steve Stricker in pairs play, played inconsistently in terrible weather conditions at Celtic Manor in Wales; the matches were delayed several times when the course became unplayable, and the format had to be significantly modified and then even extended to a fourth day to complete the event. The U.S., entering as Cup holders, lost the Cup to the European team, by the narrowest possible margin, 14.5 to 13.5. However, Woods played impressive golf in his final-day singles match, winning decisively over Francesco Molinari.\nWoods then took an extended break from competition, to refine new techniques with Foley. He returned in early November, after more than a month off, at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, where he had placed 2nd in 2009, but failed to challenge seriously. Next was a visit to Thailand, his mother's birthplace, for a one-day Skins Game, honoring King Bhumibol. At the 2010 JBWere Masters, held near Melbourne, Australia in mid-November, Woods arrived as defending champion and was paid an appearance fee of more than $3 million. He charged late on the final day to finish in fourth place. Over his final six holes, Woods made two eagles, two birdies, and two pars, to end with a round of 6-under 65. Three weeks later, resuming his role as host of the elite-field Chevron World Challenge near Los Angeles (he had skipped the 2009 event because of personal crisis; the tournament serves as a primary benefactor of his charitable foundation), Woods put up three straight rounds in the 60s, and led going into the final round for the first time in 2010. But he struggled with his long-game control in mixed weather conditions on Sunday, and putted much worse than he had in previous rounds, winding up in a tie with Graeme McDowell after 72 holes. McDowell sank a birdie putt on the final green; Woods then sank his own short birdie putt to tie. McDowell again made birdie on the first playoff hole (the 18th) from to take the title, when Woods missed from shorter range. The playoff loss meant that Woods went winless for an entire season, for the first time since turning professional. However, Woods finished the 2010 season ranked #2 in the world. He again used the Nike Method 003 putter for his final two events of 2010.\n2011: Work in progress.\nWoods opened his 2011 season at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course near San Diego. He has enjoyed tremendous success there, with six past Tour titles and a dramatic playoff win in the 2008 U.S. Open, but was making his first appearance at the course since that 2008 major win. Woods played strongly for the first two rounds, scoring 69–69 to sit five strokes behind halfway leader Bill Haas. But on the weekend, many wayward approach shots found greenside bunkers, and Woods was unable to recover sufficiently well to stay in contention. He scored 74–75 to end at one-under-par 287, 15 strokes behind winner Bubba Watson, in a tie for 44th place. It was the worst season-opening performance of his career.\nWoods made his next appearance at the Dubai Desert Classic, an event he had previously won twice and always ended inside the top five, in six previous appearances. Woods, ranked #3 in the world, was grouped with #1 Lee Westwood and #2 Martin Kaymer for the first two rounds. Woods started with 71 and scored 6-under 66 in round two to move into contention, and stayed in the hunt with 72 for round three, but struggled on Sunday with 75, to end in a tie for 20th, at 4-under 284, seven shots back of winner Álvaro Quirós. During the final round of that competition, Woods spat on the ground a few feet from the hole, after missing a putt at the 12th green. The incident was shown on televised coverage worldwide. Woods apologized for the incident in which he breached the European Tour's code of conduct; he will be fined an undisclosed sum. Later starters had to play across the area where Woods spat. Sportswriter John Feinstein stated on Golf Channel a few days after the incident that Woods is in fact the most-fined player in the history of the PGA Tour.\nWoods made his next appearance at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, a World Golf Championship event for the top 64 players. He was playing in this tournament for the first time since Accenture dropped his personal sponsorship some 14 months earlier. Woods, a three-time champion who has more match wins in the event than any other player, came in as one of the four #1 seeds, but lost in the first round on the first sudden-death hole, the 19th, to Thomas Bjørn, after the two players had tied their 18-hole match. On February 27, Woods had his world ranking drop to #5.\nWoods played next in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral's Blue Monster course, where he had never missed the top ten in any event. Woods was never in contention to win, but kept his streak going with a tie for tenth place, scoring 70-74-70-66, for eight-under-par 280, eight shots behind winner Nick Watney. His final round tied for best of the day, and was his lowest 18-hole score on the PGA Tour since the third round of the 2010 U.S. Open. After the final round, Woods commented that he was making good progress on his game with coach Sean Foley, being able to identify and correct faults during his final round at Doral. Woods put a Nike heel-shafted blade putter in play for the final two rounds, replacing his center-shafted Titleist Scotty Cameron blade model; he explained afterward that he had wanted a hotter putter to tackle Doral's grainy greens.\nWoods competed in the 2011 Tavistock Cup, a charity interclub team event, held at his home course, Isleworth Country Club, but represented the new club Albany, of the Bahamas, where he is an investor. Woods teamed with Arjun Atwal the first day to post a better-ball score of 64, and shot 69 on his own ball on day two.\nWoods next competed in the 2011 Arnold Palmer Invitational, an event he has won six times. Woods showed inconsistent play over the four rounds, carding 73-68-74-72 to finish at one-under-par 287, in a tie for 24th place, seven shots behind winner Martin Laird. His world ranking dropped to #7 the following week, the lowest it has been since the week before the 1997 Masters. Woods contended strongly in the 2011 Masters Tournament, scoring 71-66-74-67 to finish at ten-under 278, in a tie for fourth place, four shots behind winner Charl Schwartzel. His ranking rose to #5.\nWoods was sidelined from tournament play until May 12 by two leg injuries incurred in round three of the Masters. He entered the 2011 Players Championship, but withdrew after nine holes of the first round, with a score of +6, as his injuries caused him to limp noticeably. His world rank fell to #15 on June 5, his lowest since early 1997, more than 14 years ago.\nOn June 6, Woods stated that he would remain with longtime agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, he announced that he would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he was very disappointed to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that he was listening to his doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT&amp;T National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott.\nWoods returned to tournament play in early August, following a break of 11 weeks, at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he is a seven-time champion. He had Bryon Bell as caddy; Bell is a childhood friend, former high school golf teammate, and current employee of Tiger Woods Design; Bell had caddied for Woods on several previous occasions, dating back to amateur golf. Woods stated in a pre-tournament press conference that Bell is serving temporarily as his caddie, and that he has yet to make a decision on a permanent replacement for Williams. Woods also stated he is \"completely healthy\". He tied for 37th place after rounds of 68-70-71-70, as Adam Scott won with a 17-under-par total 263. Woods finished last in the field of 76 players in driving accuracy, hitting only slightly more than 40% of his fairways.\nFred Couples, 2011 Presidents Cup U.S. team captain, stated he would use a captain's pick to select Woods for the team should he not automatically qualify. Woods had his contract discontinued by sponsor Tag Heuer, a luxury Swiss watchmaker, on August 10.\nWoods, again with Bell on his bag, missed the cut at the 2011 PGA Championship, held at Atlanta Athletic Club, for the first time in that major and for only the third time in a major championship as a professional. After starting with three birdies and two pars over his first five holes, he collapsed to shoot 77, his highest first-round major score since turning pro in 1996, and followed this up with 73 the second day, to finish at ten-over-par 150, missing the cut by six strokes. He had five holes with double bogey or worse in 36 holes; the only other previous event where he had this was the 2007 Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods also failed to qualify for the 2011 FedEx Cup playoffs since he is outside the top 125 qualifying point earners.\nWith the hiring of his new caddie Joe LaCava, Woods competed in the Frys.com Open, part of the PGA Tour Fall Series for the first time in his career, finishing tied for 30th place, ten shots behind the winner, Bryce Molder. In mid-November 2011 Woods rose to 50th in the Official World Golf Ranking, from a low of #58, after finishing third at the Emirates Australian Open, his best result to date in 2011. In addition, Woods made the clinching point at the Presidents Cup when he defeated Aaron Baddeley in their singles match.\nWoods broke a career-long winless streak of 107 weeks when he birdied the last two holes to capture his fifth career win in the Chevron World Challenge, by one stroke over Zach Johnson, in early December. The Chevron is an elite-level invitational event with 18 of the world's top players, and benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation; Woods donated his entire prize, $1.2 million, to that charitable organization.\n2012: Back to form and winning again.\nHis 2012 season started at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on the European Tour in late January. For the first two days of play Tiger was grouped with Rory McIlroy and world No.1 Luke Donald. He shot under par rounds of 70 and 69 on Thursday and Friday respectively, which left him in joint 4th place at 5-under par. His low round of the week came on Saturday, shooting a 6-under par 66, giving him the joint lead with England's Robert Rock. Woods struggled on Sunday and couldn't mount a big enough charge, shooting a level par 72 and settling for joint 3rd place. Woods' second tournament of the year came at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in early February which he had not played since 2002. His amateur partner for the week was Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Woods shot solid rounds of 68-68-67 on the first three days, and began Sunday in third place, four shots behind leader Charlie Wi. However, he struggled with his putting and shot a final round 75 while his playing partner Phil Mickelson shot a 64 and won the tournament.\nHis next tournament was the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona. Woods battled to win his first round match against Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño, 1-up, and then played Nick Watney in the second round. On the 18th hole, Woods had to make birdie to extend the match, however his 5-foot putt missed and he was knocked out of the tournament. Woods commented that his putting was hindered technically and required some work after battling with it throughout the round. The following week Woods teed off at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Woods commented that he had referred back to putting basics instead of new technique he had been applying. Woods' putting over the first three days of tournament play was noticeably better, but the ball was struggling to fall into the hole. Tiger began the fourth round on 2-under par, 9 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy. After parring the first hole and being delayed by adverse weather, Woods returned and played the remaining 17 holes in 8-under par including two eagles and no bogeys. A birdie-eagle finish set up Woods to possibly claim the title, however McIlroy kept his cool and won the tournament. Tiger finished joint second, and the round also marked his lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career.\nWoods played the following week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, Florida. Tiger spent the first three days near the top of the leaderboard and shot 72-67-68 to start the fourth round in tied 8th place at 9-under par, 8 shots behind leader Bubba Watson. Woods struggled on the front 9 and shot 2-over par going out. He then began to noticeably limp on the next three holes and went on to withdraw from the tournament with an apparent left leg injury, which was later confirmed as a strain on his left Achilles tendon that had been injured previously at the 2011 Masters Tournament. After a short time off, Woods played in the Tavistock Cup at the Lake Nona Golf and Country Club, representing Team Albany, finishing 4th. The same week, Woods began the Arnold Palmer Invitational. After three rounds of 69, 65 and a 71, he began Sunday in the lead at 11-under par, one shot ahead of Graeme McDowell. Woods remained in the lead throughout the round and shot a 2-under par 70 to claim his seventh win at Bay Hill and also marked his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. After a week off, he returned to Augusta for the Masters Tournament. Over the four days, Woods was never close to contending the title, and shot rounds of 72-75-72-74 to finish tied 40th. After a 3-week break from competition, Woods traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the Wells Fargo Championship. Although starting positively with a 1-under par 71, Woods' second round of 73 (1-over) derailed his tournament hopes and resulted in him missing his eighth cut as a professional by 1 shot and second in as many years for the tournament. The following week, Woods played The Players Championship. After an opening round of 74 (2-over), he was in threat of missing a second consecutive cut, a first for his professional career, however after a 4-under 68, he was firmly staying in the tournament as well as being in the hunt for the weekend. However, a weekend charge never mounted despite good ball striking and he settled for T40th at 1-under par.\nIn June, Woods won his 73rd PGA Tour event at the Memorial Tournament. He shot rounds of 70-69-73 to begin on Sunday at 4-under par. He birdied three of his last four holes to shoot 67 and win by two shots over Andrés Romero and Rory Sabbatini, including a chip-in at the par-3 16th. Jack Nicklaus, the tournament's host, said \"I don't think under the circumstances I've ever seen a better shot\". Fittingly, Woods' 73rd victory also tied Nicklaus' number of PGA Tour victories.\nIn July 2012, Woods surpassed Nicklaus' total number of PGA Tour wins (73) after winning the AT&amp;T National in Maryland.\n2013: World Number One again.\nWoods began the year with a win in his first event in late January at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego. This was his eighth win as a professional at Torrey Pines (including the 2008 U.S. Open). He took a six-shot lead into the final round and hung on to win by four in a Monday finish caused by fog delays.\nWoods next won in early March at the WGC-Cadillac Championship event held at Doral. After shooting an opening round 66, Woods led or shared the lead in every round and won by two strokes over Steve Stricker with a 269 (−19) total. In his next event, Woods won for the eighth time at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, out-dueling Rickie Fowler in the final round. With this win, Woods reclaimed the number one spot in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time since late in 2010, taking the spot away from Rory McIlroy. Woods remained number one throughout the remainder of the season.\nThough never seriously in contention, Woods finished tied for fourth at the Masters Tournament, won by Adam Scott in a sudden-death playoff over Ángel Cabrera. In his next event, Woods won The Players Championship for the second time. Tied with Woods going to the 71st hole, Sergio García hit two balls in the water surrounding the famous island green essentially handing Woods the tournament. Woods finished far down the leaderboard at the U.S. Open at Merion in June won by Justin Rose. At the Open Championship at Muirfield in July, Woods was in contention but a poor fourth round dropped him into a tie for sixth, five shots behind Phil Mickelson, who won his first Open Championship.\nIn early August, Woods won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone for the eighth time. A second round 61 propelled Woods to a seven-shot victory, his fifth and final win of the season. Woods finished far down the leaderboard at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill where Jason Dufner won his first major. Despite hurting his back during The Barclays, Woods finished in second place, one shot behind Adam Scott. Woods did not seriously contend in the remaining FedEx Cup playoff events. In his final appearance of the season, Woods went 4–1 and led the U.S. team to a victory over the International team at the Presidents Cup held at Muirfield Village in Ohio.\nFor the 2013 season, Woods won five PGA Tour tournaments giving him 79 for his career, only three behind Sam Snead's leading all-time total of 82. Woods won the tour's money title for the 10th time and the Vardon Trophy for lowest adjusted scoring average for the 9th time. Woods was named both PGA Player of the Year and PGA Tour Player of the Year for the 11th time.\n2014–2017: Injury frustration.\n2013–14 season.\nWoods made his first appearance on the 2013–14 PGA Tour at the Farmers Insurance Open. However, for the first time in his career, he missed the cut at the event.

Subsequently, Woods announced that he would miss the Masters Tournament for the first time since 1994 to undergo a microdiscectomy.\nWoods returned ahead of schedule at the 2014 Quicken Loans National. However he struggled with every aspect of his game, missing the halfway cut. His next appearance came at the third major of the year – the Open Championship. This took place at Hoylake – location of his 2006 victory. Despite a strong start, Woods faded over the weekend to eventually finish 69th. Woods' back pain was clear to see at the 2014 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he withdrew from the tournament. Against all expectations, Woods made an unexpected appearance just one week later at the final major of the year, competing at the PGA Championship. Woods though would miss the cut. This would mark the end of the season for Woods. During the off-season, Woods split with swing coach Sean Foley.\n2014–15 season.\nThe injury woes would continue into the 2015 season. Woods missed the cut at the 2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open, with his second round 82 the worst round of his professional career. Woods then withdrew once again from the Farmers Insurance Open, citing back pain. Woods opted to return at the 2015 Masters Tournament. Woods put in a strong showing, eventually finishing 17th. This was as good as it got for Woods in the 2015 season. For the first time in his career, he would miss back-to-back cuts at majors, failing to make the weekend at both the U.S. Open and Open Championship. Woods would once again miss the cut in the final major of the season – the PGA Championship. In a last-ditch bid to make the season-ending playoffs, Woods competed at the Wyndham Championship. Despite a strong showing, Woods placed 10th, missing out on the playoffs. In September, Woods underwent a second microdiscectomy.\n2015–16 season.\nDue to the effects of his surgery, Woods missed the 2016 Masters Tournament.

At the Tour Championship, Woods produced a spectacular performance throughout the tournament, including 6 birdies in the front nine of the third round that propelled him to 12-under-par with a 3-shot lead entering the final round. Neither FedEx Cup leader Justin Rose nor playing partner Rory McIlroy were able to close the gap on Sunday, and towards the end of the tournament Woods was actually in contention to win the FedEx Cup outright when Rose dropped 3 shots on the back nine – however, Rose was able to hole a crucial birdie on the final hole to secure the FedEx Cup title. Still, Woods was joined by thousands of fans on his walk up to the 18th green after his second shot – the crowds were so overwhelming that Woods described himself as \"holding back tears\" during the walk. After a bunker shot and a two-putt for par, Woods ended a five-year victory drought with a win by two shots. This was Woods' 80th PGA Tour victory, leaving him just two short of Sam Snead's overall record.\nWoods rounded off 2018 by appearing in two unofficial events.

Woods entered the final round in the last group, aiming for a first major championship since the 2008 U.S. Open. Molinari held on to his lead on the front nine, with Woods at one point falling three shots behind. However, Molinari encountered problems on the back nine. The tide swung in Woods' favor at the 12th hole, with Molinari putting his tee shot in the water and consequently double-bogeying the par-3, while Woods made a par. As Woods' group entered hole 15, Woods was one of five players tied for the lead. Woods birdied the hole to move one shot ahead, while Molinari found the water twice, making a double bogey, before Woods moved two ahead following another birdie at 16. After making par at 17, Woods bogeyed the final hole to complete a round of 70, thus claiming a one-shot victory. This was Woods' 5th Masters Tournament triumph, 15th major championship victory, and his first when trailing after three rounds. The victory put him three shy of Jack Nicklaus' overall record. Woods' victory was also his 81st PGA Tour win, and was lauded by many as the greatest sporting comeback of all time. After the Masters win, Woods rose into the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking at number 6. The following day, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would present Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his incredible comeback in sports and life, which was awarded to him on May 6, 2019.\nAt the 2019 PGA Championship, which was moved from August to May effective in 2019, Woods shot a 5-over-par 72–73 over the first two rounds, missing the cut by one stroke.

Citing a mild oblique strain, he withdrew after shooting a 4-over-par 75 in the first round. At the BMW Championship the next week, he finished tied for 37th at 7-under-par, 18 strokes behind the winner, Justin Thomas. With that finish, Woods failed to qualify for the Tour Championship.\n2019–2020: 82nd win.\nComing off minor knee surgery in late August, Woods played his first event of the 2020 PGA Tour season in October 2019 at the inaugural Zozo Championship in Japan. With rounds of 64-64-66-68, he won by three strokes over Hideki Matsuyama. The win gave him 82 wins on the PGA Tour, moving Woods into a tie with Sam Snead for the most career wins on the Tour. \nHis next event came at the Hero World Challenge. After struggling with some evident rust in round 1, he rebounded with 3 consecutive rounds in the 60s and finished solo fourth. He ended the calendar year by leading the U.S. team to a 16–14 win in the 2019 Presidents Cup. As a playing captain, Woods, won all three matches in which he competed. He concluded the 2019 calendar year in sixth place in the Official World Golf Ranking, his best year-ending result since 2013.\nWoods' first appearance in 2020 came at the Farmers Insurance Open – where he finished tied for 9th. Three weeks later, he competed at the Genesis Invitational, but a disappointing weekend performance contributed to a final position of tied 69th.\nWoods opted to skip the 2020 WGC-Mexico Championship, stating that he felt he 'wasn't going to be ready' for the event, having played at the Genesis Invitational the previous week. Woods unexpectedly skipped two more events in the following two weeks – The Honda Classic and the Arnold Palmer Invitational; the latter of which he attributed to 'back stiffness'. Having then opted to sit out the Players Championship, fears grew that Woods may be unable to defend his Masters title.\nHowever, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Players Championship was cancelled after one round and the PGA Tour entered a three-month hiatus, including the postponements or cancellation of all four major championships. Woods, after choosing not to play in the first five tournaments of the revamped schedule, rejoined the Tour at the Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied for 40th at six over par. In the first major of the year, Woods finished the PGA Championship at one under par, tied for 37th.\nWoods' next two tournaments were the first two rounds of the FedEx Cup playoffs. At The Northern Trust, he shot 68-71 (three under par) on Thursday and Friday, making the cut by one stroke. Over the weekend, he had rounds of 73 and 66 to finish tied for 58th at six under par. The following week at the BMW Championship, for the first time in ten years Woods shot four rounds over par in a single tournament to finish eleven over par, tied for 51st. Woods finished the season in 63rd place in the FedEx Cup standings.\n2020–21 season.\nIn Woods' first appearance of the 2020-21 PGA Tour, he missed the cut at the rescheduled U.S. Open in mid-September. At the Zozo Championship, which had relocated from the Greater Tokyo Area to Lake Sherwood, California due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Woods finished tied for 72nd. Woods' last tournament of 2020 was The Masters, rescheduled from April to November, where he finished tied for 38th.\nHe played in the PNC Championship in December, alongside his son Charlie.\nOn February 23, 2021, Woods was hospitalized in serious but stable condition after a single-car collision and underwent emergency surgery to repair compound fractures sustained in each leg in addition to a shattered ankle. Three months after the accident, in an interview with Golf Digest, Woods did not mention anything about his future as a golfer, but said his primary goal is simply walking under his own power.\n2021–22 season.\nWoods competed at the 2022 Masters finishing 47th but withdrew from the 2022 PGA Championship after a third round 79 and was cut from the 2022 Open Championship.\nCut streak.\nWoods owns the PGA Tour record for consecutive cuts made at 142. The streak started in February 1998 at the Buick Invitational and ended at the Wachovia Championship in May 2005. Woods' tournament previous to the Buick Invitational was the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, from which he withdrew after its third and final round was postponed from February to August due to weather. The tournament that ended Woods' streak was the 2005 EDS Byron Nelson Championship, where he missed the cut by one stroke. He beat the previous record of 113, held by Byron Nelson, at The Tour Championship in November 2003.\nIn both Nelson's and Woods's eras, \"making the cut\" has been defined as receiving a paycheck. However, in Nelson's day, only players who placed in the top 20 (sometimes as few as 15) in an event won a paycheck, whereas in Woods's day only players who reach a low enough score (top 70 and ties for most events) within the first 36 holes win a paycheck. Several golf analysts argue that Woods did not actually surpass Nelson's consecutive cuts mark, reasoning that 31 of the tournaments in which Woods competed were \"no-cut\" events, meaning all the players in the field were guaranteed to compete throughout the entire event regardless of their scores through 36 holes (and hence all \"made the cut,\" meaning that they all received a paycheck). These analysts argue that this would leave Woods's final consecutive cuts made at 111, and Nelson's at 113.\nHowever, at least ten of the tournaments in which Nelson played did not have modern-day cuts; that is, all of the players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. The Masters, for example, did not institute a 36-hole cut until 1957 (which was well after Nelson retired), the PGA Championship was match play until 1958, and it is unclear whether or not three other events in which Nelson competed had 36-hole cuts. Therefore, these analysts remove \"no 36-hole cut\" events from both cut streak measures, leaving Nelson's consecutive cuts made at 103 (or possibly less) and Woods's at 111.\nIn the tournaments in which Nelson competed that did not have 36-hole cuts (that is: the Masters, PGA Championship and the possible three other tournaments), only the top 20 players received a paycheck even though all players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. Hence, in these no-cut events, Nelson still placed in the top 20, so Nelson's 113 cuts made are reflective of his 113 top 20 finishes. Woods achieved a top 20 finish 21 consecutive times (from July 2000 to July 2001) and, in the 31 no-cut events in which he played, he won 10 and finished out of the top 10 only five times. Others, including Woods himself, argue that the two streaks cannot be compared, because the variation of tournament structures in the two eras is too great for any meaningful comparison to be made.\nA more relevant comparison on cut streaks is the 105 consecutive cuts made by Jack Nicklaus between 1970 and 1976, ending at the 1976 World Open. The cut format from that era was virtually identical to the current PGA Tour practice, and most events in Nicklaus' streak, except for the Tournament of Champions (now the SBS Championship), the World Series of Golf (now the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational), and the U.S. Professional Match Play Championship (10 events for Nicklaus) had a cut made after 36 holes.\nRyder Cup performance.\nDespite his outstanding success on the PGA Tour, Woods had little success in the Ryder Cup early in his career. In his first Ryder Cup in 1997, he earned only 1½ points competing in every match and partnering mostly with Mark O'Meara. Costantino Rocca defeated Woods in his singles match. In 1999, he earned 2 points over every match with a variety of partners. In 2002, he lost both Friday matches, but, partnered with Davis Love III for both of Saturday's matches, won two points for the Americans, and was slated to anchor the Americans for the singles matches, both squads going into Sunday with 8 points. However, after the Europeans took an early lead, his match with Jesper Parnevik was rendered unimportant and they halved the match. In 2004, he was paired with Phil Mickelson on Friday but lost both matches, and only earned one point on Saturday. With the Americans facing a 5–11 deficit, he won the first singles match, but the team was not able to rally. In 2006, he was paired with Jim Furyk for all of the pairs matches, and they won two of their four matches. Woods won his singles match, one of only three Americans to do so that day. Woods missed the 2008 Ryder Cup competition altogether, as he was recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Despite Woods' absence, the United States team posted its largest margin of victory in the event since 1981. In 2010, Woods had a successful Ryder Cup going 3–1–0. He played all team matches with Steve Stricker and defeated Francesco Molinari 4&amp;3 in his singles match where he made 9 birdies. However, Europe won in a very close match, 14.5 to 13.5. In 2012, paired again with Stricker, both players struggled going 0–3–0 together for the week. For the first time in his career, Woods would sit out a session in the Ryder Cup. He and Stricker were the only Americans who did not have a point going into the Sunday singles. In his singles match against Francesco Molinari, Woods was 1 up on the 18th fairway. After seeing Martin Kaymer clinch the Ryder Cup for Europe, Woods conceded the hole after missing his par putt. He would halve the match giving Europe the outright victory, and finish his week at 0–3–1. In 2018, Woods was initially named a vice-captain by Jim Furyk. Despite only playing half as many events as his peers, Woods still finished 11th in the final standings and was subsequently chosen as a captain's pick. Paired with Patrick Reed for the two four-ball sessions, they lost each time to Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who went 4–0 together for team Europe, with Molinari going 5–0 at the event. In his Saturday afternoon foursome match, he again lost to the European duo, paired this time with Bryson DeChambeau. Woods would also go on to lose his singles match to Jon Rahm 2&amp;1 to mark the first time in his career that he lost every match he played in one Ryder Cup tournament. Europe would defeat United States by a score of 17.5 to 10.5. In the 8 Ryder Cups that Woods competed in from 1997 to 2018, he won 14.5 points from a possible 37."

        "text": "Charles Bruce Miller (born March 4, 1947) is an American former Major League Baseball utility infielder. He played for the San Francisco Giants from to . Miller was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 20th round of the 1970 MLB June Amateur Draft from Indiana University. Miller led the Hoosiers in hits in both 1968 and 1969, earning all Big Ten honors at shortstop in 1969. He advanced through the White Sox farm system, hitting .289 for the 1972 Triple-A Tucson Toros, and was traded to the California Angels along with Bruce Kimm for veteran pitcher Eddie Fisher in August 1972.\nIn 1973, his stay with the Angels was brief as they traded him that April for Al Gallagher. Miller then spent most of the year with the Phoenix Giants, making the 1973 Pacific Coast League All-Star team, and was rewarded with a late-season call-up by the Giants in August 1973, batting .143. He split duty in 1974 between the Triple-A Phoenix Giants and the San Francisco Giants, hitting .278 in 215 plate appearances in the big leagues. Miller went 4-4 against the St. Louis Cardinals in a June 6, 1974 game and had a 3 RBI game against the Houston Astros in September.\nMiller spent all of 1975 with the Giants, with a .239 average in 328 at-bats in an infield utility role. He hit his first and only major-league home run off Clay Kirby of the Cincinnati Reds in Cincinnati in a July 31, 1975 game. Miller also went 2-4 with 4 RBIs in an August home match-up with the Montreal Expos and had 5 game-winning hits in 1975.\n1976 was again a split season, with most of the year spent with the Giants Triple-A affiliate in Phoenix. Miller did get called up to San Francisco during the summer for a 12-game stretch, hitting .160 in his final taste of major-league action. His final game in MLB was August 28, 1976. Miller was with the 4th place Giants on September 19, 1976 when, on a flight returning from a series in Cincinnati, he got into a drunken altercation with the team statistician, Ralph Nelson, and traveling secretary, Frank Bergonzi. Miller and teammate Mike Caldwell demanded another drink from the flight attendant, Bergonzi intervened, and Miller punched Nelson in the in-flight altercation. Miller was sent to the minors by the Giants as a result, his contract out-righted to Phoenix and then released by the organization. Giants Manager Bill Rigney resigned at the end of the season, and Caldwell was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in October. The Giants banned alcohol on team flights the following season.\nMiler played professional softball with the Fort Wayne Huggie Bears of the United Professional Softball League during their 1980 season. The team played at the Tah-Cum-Wah Recreation Center in Fort Wayne.\nMiller went on to become a teacher on the North Side High School, and served as a baseball coach and was a 2012 Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame inductee."

        "text": "Charles Stephen Bicknell (July 27, 1928 – November 24, 2013) was an American professional baseball pitcher who appeared in 30 games in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies during the and seasons. Bicknell threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . He was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, where he graduated from high school. He attended Seton Hall University.\nOf his 30 appearances, 29 came in a relief role. His only MLB decision, a loss, came in his only opportunity as a starting pitcher. On July 22, 1948, he took the mound against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field, and failed to record an out, walking the first two batters in the Buc lineup before giving up an RBI single to future Baseball Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner. He then was replaced by reliever Ed Heusser, who allowed the two runners he inherited to score. Staked to a three-run, first-inning advantage, Pittsburgh went on to win, 5–3. In his two full big-league seasons, Bicknell surrendered 61 hits in 54 innings pitched, but had a poor 9-to-34 strikeout-to-walk ratio. His career earned run average was also subpar, at 6.83.\nThe Boston Braves acquired Bicknell in 1950 and sent him to the minor leagues, and he never returned to the majors. Altogether, he spent a decade (1947–1950 and 1952–1957) in professional baseball,"

        "title": "Jon Weber (baseball)",
        "text": "Jonathan Brian Weber (born January 20, 1978, in Lakewood, California) is an American former professional baseball player. An outfielder, Weber batted and threw left-handed. Considered a journeyman throughout his career, Weber played professionally in minor and independent league baseball from 1999 to 2015. Weber also competed for the United States national baseball team, winning the gold medal at the 2009 Baseball World Cup.\nAmateur career.\nWeber was born in Lakewood, California. He attended Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California. There, he played for the school's baseball team, known as the Lancers, graduating in 1996.\nOut of high school, Weber was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the thirty-first round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft. He chose not to sign with the Athletics, opting to attend college. He began his college baseball career at Los Angeles Harbor College (LAHC) of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) in 1997. At LAHC, Weber was a NJCAA All-America selection.\nIn 1999, Weber transferred to Texas Tech University to compete in the NCAA Division I during his junior year. At Texas Tech, he played college baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders baseball team in the Big 12 Conference. Weber led the conference with eight triples, setting a Red Raiders team record in the process. He was named the \"Collegiate Baseball\" National Player of the Week and Big 12 Baseball Player/Pitcher of the Week for the week of February 1, 1999. Weber became the fourth player in Texas Tech history to hit for the cycle.\nProfessional career.\nWeber signed his first professional contract with the Cincinnati Reds as a non-drafted free agent in August 1999. He made his professional debut that summer with the Rookie-level Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League, recording a .238 batting average, .365 on-base percentage (OBP) and .500 slugging percentage (SLG) with five home runs and 17 runs batted in (RBI) in 22 games. The next year, he hit .221 with a .333 OBP and .333 SLG with six home runs and 34 RBIs in 108 games for the Single-A Clinton LumberKings of the Midwest League. However, Weber was released by the Reds after the season. He felt the Reds \"treated [him] like a non-prospect\".\nIn 2001, Weber played independent league baseball for the Canton Crocodiles of the Frontier League. He batted .307 with a .382 OBP, .559 SLG, 18 home runs and 69 RBI in 84 games, being named to the Frontier League post-season All-Star team. He led the Frontier League in home runs and triples. Canton sold Weber to the Fargo-Moorhead Redhawks of the independent Northern League in 2002, where he hit .296 with a .351 OBP, .501 SLG, and 30 doubles for Fargo-Morehead, placing fourth in the league in doubles. Back with Fargo-Moorhead to open 2003, he batted .309 with a .408 OBP and .520 SLG through 52 games, as the team went on to win the Northern League championship.\nHowever, in July 2003, the Oakland Athletics organization purchased Weber's contract from Fargo-Moorhead. With the Athletics organization, Weber hit .361 with a .394 OBP, .626 SLG, seven home runs and 48 RBIs in 35 games with the Single-A Advanced Modesto A's of the California League for the remainder of that year. In 2004, he hit .280 with a .356 OBP, .458 SLG, 15 home runs and 68 RBI in 111 games with the Double-A Midland RockHounds of the Texas League, and hit .341 with a .383 OBP, .568 SLG, two home runs and 12 RBI in 12 games with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), helping the River Cats win the PCL championship.\nWeber signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 2004 season as a free agent. In 2005, he hit .300 with a .369 OBP, .456 SLG, 11 home runs and 68 RBIs in 117 games with the Double-A Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League. He was ninth in the league in batting average and led the league's outfielders in assists (19) and double plays (7). With Weber, Jacksonville won the Southern League championship, his third year in a row as a member of a championship-winning team. During the season, Weber received a 15-game suspension for violating minor league baseball's drug policy. Weber, who failed a drug test administered in August 2004, said he had taken thermogin, a supplement that contained the banned substance ephedrine, and denied taking steroids.\nAfter starting the 2006 season with the Triple-A Las Vegas Stars of the PCL, where he hit .258 with a .338 OBP, .352 SLG, 2 home runs and 31 RBI in 82 games, he was released. He signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he played for the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders of the PCL, hitting .321 with a .374 OBP, .518 SLG, 5 home runs and 27 RBI in 46 games. The Sidewinders won the PCL championship, Weber's fourth consecutive league championship.\nWeber was released by the Diamondbacks during 2007 spring training. He signed with Fargo-Moorhead. After 16 games there, batting .283 with a .371 OBP and .417 SLG, his contract was sold to the Texas Rangers on June 4, 2007. The Rangers assigned him to the Single-A Advanced Bakersfield Blaze of the California League, where he hit .356 with a .416 OBP, .550 SLG, five home runs, 14 doubles, 25 RBI, and 34 runs scored in 37 games. After spending a month with the Rangers organization, on July 16, the Tampa Bay Rays purchased his contract from the Rangers and assigned him to the Triple-A Durham Bulls of the International League. There, he hit .265 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 39 games. Weber re-signed with the Rays on a minor league contract after the 2007 season, and batted .265 with a .334 OBP, .447 SLG, 13 home runs for the Bulls in 2008.\nWeber returned to the Rays' organization in 2009, almost making the Rays' opening day roster until Matt Joyce recovered from an injury. Weber returned to Durham, where he hit .302 with 14 home runs in 117 games, and led the 2009 International League with 46 doubles and finished ninth in batting average. He was named to the International League post-season All-Star team.\nAfter the 2009 season, Weber signed with the New York Yankees organization and was invited to spring training for the 2010 season. Weber signed with the Yankees because they gave him an opportunity to compete for a job in the major leagues, while other teams told him they viewed him exclusively as a minor leaguer. In spring training, Weber led the Yankees with a .483 batting average and was presented with the James P. Dawson Award, given annually to the best rookie in the Yankees' camp. Manager Joe Girardi indicated that Weber could beat out Marcus Thames and Rule 5 draft pick Jamie Hoffmann for the fifth outfielder position on the Yankees 25 man roster, but ultimately the Yankees chose Thames, as the Yankees preferred a right-handed batter to complement their left-handed hitting outfielders, and assigned Weber to the Triple-A Scranton Wilkes-Barre Yankees. He hit .258 with no home runs in 47 games with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before being released by the Yankees on June 3. He signed with the Detroit Tigers, reporting to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. He hit .256 with a .310 OBP and .372 SLG in 21 games for Toledo. He announced his retirement on July 15, 2010.\nOn July 19, 2010, Major League Baseball announced Weber's 100-game suspension for having failed a drug test for the third time. The drug was identified as a \"drug of abuse\" rather than a performance-enhancing drug.\nDespite announcing his retirement earlier in the year, Weber continued his career in leagues unaffiliated with MLB. He played winter league baseball in the winter of 2010–11 in the Dominican Republic, then signed with the Winnipeg Goldeyes of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball in June when they had an injury to outfielder Jonathan Wyatt. Weber was named the team's most valuable player. Weber returned to Winnipeg for the 2012 season. After batting .281 in 78 games, the Goldeyes waived Weber, giving him his unconditional release.\nInternational career.\nWeber joined the United States national baseball team for the 2009 Baseball World Cup held in Nettuno, Italy in September 2009, helping the United States win the gold medal. Weber made the Cup's All-Tournament Team.\nWeber has routinely played winter league baseball. Following the 2006 season, Weber played for the Naranjeros de Hermosillo of the Mexican Pacific League (MPL), appearing in the 2006 Caribbean Series. He played for the Cañeros de Los Mochis of the MPL after the 2007 season. With the Venados de Mazatlán of the MPL after the 2008 season, Weber reached the 2009 Caribbean Series. In the 2011–12 offseason, he played for the Gigantes del Cibao of the Dominican Winter League.\nPersonal life.\nWeber is divorced. He has two children. Weber works in construction during his time away from baseball to help make ends meet."

        "text": "The Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project is an effort started by Peoria, Illinois anesthesiologist Jeremy Krock and with support of the Society for American Baseball Research to put a proper headstone on the graves of former Negro league baseball players.\nHistory of the Project.\nFounded in 2004, the Project started when Dr. Krock contacted members of the Society for American Baseball Research after he discovered there was no headstone on the grave of Jimmie Crutchfield, a player who grew up in Krock's childhood home of Ardmore, Missouri.\nAfter Crutchfield, the Project went on to place headstones on the graves of notables like John Donaldson, Candy Jim Taylor, Theodore \"High Pockets\" Trent, Steel Arm Johnny Taylor, Sam Bankhead, Bobby Robinson, Bill Gatewood, James Edward \"Sap\" Ivory, Robery \"Fuzzy\" Garrett, Frank Grant and Dink Mothell.\nSome of the cemeteries where the group has installed stones include Burr Oak Cemetery in Cook County, Illinois, Springdale Cemetery in Peoria, Illinois, East Ridgelawn Cemetery in Clifton, New Jersey, Mt. Zion Cemetery in York County, Pennsylvania, and Greenwood Cemetery and Allegheny Cemetery which are both in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nWhile the grave marker project depends mostly on small contributions, the group has also received sizeable donations from people like Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, former player and manager Don Zimmer, and former 8th Commissioner of Baseball Fay Vincent. In fact, Vincent noted he had met Jimmie Crutchfield and liked him. Vincent has gone on to say the Baseball color line which led to good black athletes being excluded from Major League Baseball was ...\"one of the great insults to a community.\"\nThe project has managed to seed other gravesite work in the community and in the burial industry. For instance, the wife of Jimmie Crutchfield lay beside him and was also unmarked until the Cemetery donated a marker for Julia Crutchfield. Olivia Taylor, the wife of C.I. Taylor is also on the list for a headstone. Often a headstone, such as the marker for Bill Gatewood was donated by the headstone engraver, which automatically advances the donated money to the next Negro league baseball player headstone.\nBaseball historian Larry Lester works with Dr. Krock and with other researchers of the Society for American Baseball Research, they have compiled a list of about 3,600 players, their birth dates and death dates, where they are buried, and if they have headstones. Much of the research comes from the Negro Leagues Research Committee, an arm of the Society for American Baseball Research.\nHonors and awards.\nIn 2011, the Josh Gibson foundation honored Dr. Krock and the people behind his Grave Marker Project. Gibson himself was buried in an unmarked grave for nearly three decades.\nKrock has received numerous awards from Society for American Baseball Research, including a 2011 Fay Vincent Most Valuable Partner Award at the Jerry Malloy Negro League Conference. Krock also gives an annual report at this conference.\nBurr Oak Cemetery Controversy.\nOn July 9, 2009 Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart alleged that four workers at Burr Oak Cemetery dug up more than 200 graves, dumped the bodies into unmarked mass graves, and resold the plots in a scheme that went back at least five years. Burr Oak Cemetery has become well known as one of the few cemeteries that has historically focused on the needs of the African American community, it is the final resting place of many black celebrities, including Chicago blues musicians, athletes, and other notables.\nChicago's Cook County Sheriff's Office created a website to give anyone in the world the ability to search 43,555 photos in a database of marked, identified graves at the Burr Oak Cemetery. While it is unknown if any Negro league baseball players' graves were involved in the Burr Oak Cemetery scandal, researchers continue work to determine if this is true."
