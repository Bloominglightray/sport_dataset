        "title": "Baseball in Puerto Rico",
        "text": "Baseball is the most popular sport in Puerto Rico. In terms of spectators and active participants, it is the premier sport on the island.\nThe baseball game was introduced to the island in the late 19th century and the first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897, before the American invasion of 1898 known as the Spanish–American War. The sport was initially ridiculed as an effete, unmanly exhibition. However, when local Puerto Rican teams regularly defeated and embarrassed the more \"experienced\" American teams, the sport began to catch on.\nAs of 2016, over 100 Major League Baseball players were active in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, in addition to the many hundreds who participated in the past.\nSome of the most famous baseball players from Puerto Rico include Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente, Orlando Cepeda, Roberto Alomar, Iván Rodríguez and Edgar Martinez; as well as Jose \"Cheo\" Cruz; Juan González; Victor Pellot; Yadier Molina; and Bernie Williams.\nEarly history of baseball in Puerto Rico.\nThe game of baseball was introduced to the island in the late 19th century, by Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was poorly received by the hard-working farmers, tobacco workers and sugarcane cutters of the island, who considered it an effete, unmanly game.\nThe first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897: the \"Almendares\" Baseball Club owned by Francisco Alamo Armas, and the \"Borinquen\" Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.\nAccording to \"El País\" newspaper, the first organized baseball game was played on January 11, 1898, at the old velodrome in Santurce, San Juan. The \"Borinquen\" beat the \"Almendares\" by a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898, when the \"Borinquen\" beat the \"Almendares\" again, by a score of 9 to 3.\nLater that same year, Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War. By way of recreation, the American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local Puerto Rican clubs. On November 4, 1900, the \"Almendares\" Baseball Club trounced the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry, by a score of 32 to 18.\nIn the early 1920s teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Baseball Club and the Porto Rican Stars, would travel to New York City to play against some of the professional American teams.\nLiga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente.\nPuerto Rico has a winter baseball league named the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, formerly known as \"Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico\" (LBPPR) and Puerto Rico Baseball League, that has operated since the early 20th century. The champion of the Puerto Rico league represents Puerto Rico in the annual Caribbean World Series.\nThe LBPRC currently has six teams:\nIn 2007, the LBPPR recessed for the first time since its creation. In 2008, the organization resumed operations, but with several structural changes. These included reducing the league to only four teams, renaming the league as the \"Puerto Rico Baseball League\", and establishing a website.\nCurrently, the league's champion also participates in the Caribbean Series.\nIn 2008, the LBPPR participated in the first inter-league series with the LBPDR, otherwise known as the \"Liga de Beisbol Profesional de la Republica Dominicana\" (Professional Baseball League of the Dominican Republic).\nInception and early years of the league (1938–1940).\nEnrique Huyke, a professor from Mayagüez, originally suggested the establishment of an organized baseball league in Puerto Rico. The idea was adopted by Teofilo Maldonado, president of the Commission on Recreation and Sports. Gabriel Castro helped Huyke with the scouting of organizations, which had to pay $1,000 prior to being admitted. The Guayama Rotary Club collaborated in raising funds for the teams. The \"Liga de Béisbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico\" (LBSPR) was founded in 1938, as a semi-professional league. The new league consisted of six teams: the Senadores de San Juan (\"San Juan Senators\"), Leones de Ponce (\"Ponce Lions\"), Indios de Mayagüez (\"Mayagüez Indians\"), Criollos de Caguas (\"Caguas Creoles\"), Brujos de Guayama (\"Guayama Witch Doctors\"), and Grises Orientales de Humacao (\"Humacao Oriental Grays\").\nMaldonado was named the league's commissioner. The league set deadlines for changes in the rosters, which were allowed only during the first half of the season, and the number of games played has historically varied from 40 to 80 games per season. The All-Star game was scheduled to coincide with the traditional Three Kings Day, January 6, an idea suggested by Angel Colón so that the proceeds could be used to buy toys. This date was used for decades, until the emergence of television forced the league to comply with dates requested by the networks. .The first Puerto Rican players to play in U.S. Major League Baseball, Hiram Bithorn and Luis Olmo, were active in the rosters of San Juan and Caguas. Bithorn became the youngest manager in the league's history, named to the position in 1938 at the age of 22. Enrique Huyke served as manager for Mayagüez for less than a month, because the team's owner threatened to remove its entry if he did not take the office. One of the main figures of the league in its early stage was Negro leagues’ veteran, Emilio Navarro.\nIn the 1939–40 season, the Cangrejeros de Santurce (\"Santurce Crabbers\") and Tiburones de Aguadilla (\"Aguadilla Sharks\") joined the original teams. On January 8, 1939, Humacao and San Juan played an 18-inning game that lasted four hours, establishing a record.\nBetween 1938 and 1941, the LBSPR was part of the National Semi-Professional Baseball Congress, with titleholder Guayama facing the champions of the Congress’ United States branch in best-of-seven series in 1939, where they defeated the Duncan Cementers, and again in 1940.\nIn 1939–40, Perucho Cepeda won the league's batting championship over Josh Gibson, who managed to win it the following season. The \"Criollos de Caguas\" won their first championship in 1940/41, defeating the \"Cangrejeros\" in the final series. Santurce's Luis Cabrera was the last player to win the LBSPR’ Most Valuable Player award.\nIn October, 1940, Hall of Fame pitcher Satchel Paige arrived in Puerto Rico, four weeks after the start of the 1939/40 winter season. He joined the \"Brujos de Guayama\" (Guayama Witch Doctors), who also featured shortstop Perucho Cepeda and outfielder Tetelo Vargas. On November 5, Paige pitched a shut out against rival Santurce, which featured player-manager Josh Gibson, by a lopsided score of 23 to 0.\nIn a December game against Mayagüez, Paige set a league record by striking out 17 batters. He ended the season with a 19–3 record, a 1.93 ERA, and 208 strikeouts in 205 innings. The 19 wins and 208 strikeouts set single-season league records, that have never been broken. Paige helped his team win the league championship playoff series, winning two games against the \"San Juan Senadores.\" Paige went on to win the league's Most Valuable Player award in 1940. The town of Guayama is widely known for its Santería, Palo (religion), and other spiritualist religious practices. In a legendary game in Guayama, Paige walked off the mound, because he saw a ghost standing next to him.\nProfessional status.\nOn September 14, 1941, Rafael Delgado Márquez proposed that the league recognize a move from semi-professional to professional status by renaming itself to \"Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico\" (LBPPR).\nThe league used a format of \"vueltas\" (halves), where the winners of each half facing each other for the championship. However, Ponce managed to win four consecutive championships (1941–45), and in three of those seasons (1941/42, 1943/44, 1944/45) they won both halves and were declared champions without participating in a final. Consequently, once the other teams were eliminated from winning the second-half title, their fans tended to lose interest. Some players also dropped out after their teams were eliminated. To deal with this issue, in 1948/49 the league established a new playoff format that included the top four teams.\nDrafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1941, Hiram Bithorn was the first Puerto Rican to ever play major league baseball. The world took notice in 1943, when Bithorn went 18–12 with an earned run average of 2.60, and completed 19 of his 30 starts. He also led the league in shutouts (seven), setting a record for Puerto Rican pitchers that stands to this day.\nFrancisco Coímbre was a key member of Ponce's success, winning two batting championships and a Most Valuable Player award. He went three consecutive seasons (1939–42) without striking out. Other players that participated for Ponce included Juan Guilbe and Griffin Tirado. In 1943/44 and 1944/45, Ponce pitcher Tomás \"Planchardón\" Quiñones won back-to-back Most Valuable Player awards.\nWorld War II affected the league directly, reducing the 1942/43 season's length to 36 games and the number of active teams to four. The league continued with four teams through 1945/46, but they played 48 games from 1943 to 1946. From 1942 to 1944, teams were not allowed to bring in imported players. In the 1944/45 season, Luis \"Canena\" Márquez debuted in the league and hit .361, setting the record for highest batting average by a rookie.\nThe \"Senadores de San Juan\" won their first championship in 1945/46, defeating the Indios in the finals. During this season, Joe Buzas became the first foreign MLB player to manage in the LBPPR.\nVictor Pellot, also known as Vic Power, made his debut for the \"Criollos\" on the 1947–48 season, when the team won the league title. The team roster included Rafaelito Ortiz, the only pitcher to win ten or more games for three different LBPPR teams.\nIn 1947, the New York Yankees participated in a five-game series against teams from the Caribbean leagues. In Puerto Rico, Ponce and an All-Star LBPPR team defeated the Yankees on consecutive nights. José \"Pantalones\" Santiago debuted in this season, earning the Rookie of the Year recognition while Canena Marquez broke Josh Gibson's home run record of 13.\nIn 1948–49, the LBPPR joined the Caribbean Series, beginning a rivalry with Cuba that lasted throughout the next decade, until Cuba ceased to participate in the event.\nLeon Day, a member of the U.S. Negro leagues, also played for \"Los Triburones de Aguadilla\" (the Aguadilla Sharks) in Puerto Rico. When Day was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, he became the only Hall of Famer to be enshrined with a cap of a team outside the mainland U.S. – his plaque depicts him as a \"Tiburon de Aguadilla.\"\nNew stadiums built.\nA decade after its foundation the league was employing an 80-game schedule, with an average season attendance of 750,000.\nEstadio Sixto Escobar was the oldest stadium, built in San Juan in 1935. It was also the largest, with 13,135 seats and a maximum capacity of over 15,000.\nBy the 1949–50 season, several new ballparks were built, each containing 6,000 or more seats. The largest new stadium was Ponce's Estadio Francisco Montaner with 9,718 seats. Montaner has the distinction of being the first stadium in Puerto Rico that installed an artificial surface field. The installation of lights, which allowed for night games, further boosted stadium attendances. The Stadium was named to honor Francisco \"Paquito\" Montaner, one of the greatest Puerto Rican pitchers of all times.\nPerucho Cepeda was one of the league's dominant figures during the 1940s, winning two batting championships.\nNatalio Irizarry won the league's Rookie of the Year recognition in 1949–50. From 1949 to 1955, the league featured the participation of new MLB players, including Johnny Logan, Harvey Haddix and Hank Aaron among several others.\nThe MLB players kept returning, and encouraged more MLB to join them, began of the calibre of league play and because of the warm climate during winter months. Players from the Negro leagues preferred it due to a lack of racism towards the players, as opposed to the United States.\nEmergence of Clemente and Cepeda.\nIn 1952, Roberto Clemente made his debut with the \"Cangrejeros\" hitting .234. He was signed by Pedrin Zorilla, debuting in the league as a teenager. The team won that year's title and Cot Deal was named MVP. Clemente improved this average to .288 the following season, but Santurce finished last in the league. The league's champions were the \"Criollos\", who also won the Caribbean Series. With a roster that also included Luis Olmo, Willie Mays and Rubén Gómez, the \"Cangrejeros\" won the 1954–55 championship defeating Caguas in the finals, 4–1. \nDuring this season, Clemente became the first Puerto Rican player to hit two home runs in the league's All-Star game. The team also went on to win the Caribbean Series, which were held in Venezuela. Jim Rivera had an average of .450 and was named MVP. Puerto Rican fans received the team with a parade upon landing and Luis Muñoz Marín welcomed them in La Fortaleza.\nIn 1955–56, the \"Criollos\" won the league's championship, in a season that marked Orlando Cepeda's debut in the league. Clemente won the season's batting championship with an average of .396. In 1956–57, the league's championship was won by the Indios. During this season, Clemente went on to break the league's record for most games with hits, previously established by Francisco Coimbre in 1943–44.\nThe following season, the \"Criollos\" defeated the \"Cangrejeros\" to win the championship. Clemente who now played for Caguas, hit .529 during the final series. Juan \"Terin\" Pizarro won the Most Valuable Player Award, leading the league in wins, ERA, best win-to-loss margin and pitched the LBPPR's seventh no-hitter. In the Caribbean Series, he defeated Carta Vieja of Panama (8:0), recording 17 strikeouts. Both teams traded the final two championships of the decade.\nIn 1958–59, Orlando Cepeda, coming from his first season in the Majors where he was selected Rookie of the Year in the National League, kept things on fire with Santurce winning the batting title and MVP award, helping the Crabbers win their fourth championship. The 1959–60 season marked the first instance that LBPPR games were transmitted in two languages through radio. The Criollos won the championship, while Mayagüez's Ramón Luis Conde won the Most Valuable Player Award.\nIn 1961–62, coming from his best season in the big leagues, Cepeda was also LBPPR leader in home runs and RBIs, and won his second MVP Award guiding Santurce to its fifth championship.\nEconomic and political factors.\nDuring the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy grew significantly, and this encouraged baseball-related gambling. This tendency experienced a notable increase in the early 1960s. Other changes carried in the game's style, with the introduction of more player-managers such as Luis Olmo, who became the first to consistently employ pitching coaches and closers in the league.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution, hotels and casinos in San Juan benefited from Havana’ economic decay. During this timeframe, Puerto Rico expanded its presence in the Caribbean, and a native team frequently played again a representation of St. Thomas and Saint Croix in February. Julio Navarro was drafted from one of these exhibitions, eventually becoming one of the league's dominant pitchers. \nIn 1961–62, due to political tension between the U.S. and Cuba, the Caribbean Series planned for in Havana's \"Estadio Latinoamericano\" (Latin American Stadium) was cancelled. The event was replaced by the Interamerican Series, which San Juan attended with a roster that included pitcher Florentino Rivera.\nNew leagues, series and stadiums.\nDuring the 1960s the Dominican Winter League was still not a member of the Caribbean Confederation, which allowed uncommon interleague trades between it and the LBPPR, which would have more trouble negotiating such deals with member leagues. During this decade, some of the league's teams would provide import players with houses and taxis for transportation. The \"Senadores de San Juan\", led by Clemente, who had just won the MLB World Series with Pittsburgh, won the league's 1960–61 season, as well as José Santiago, who posted a record of 10–2 with an ERA of 2.44 for the team. Luis Arroyo won the season's Most Valuable Player award, registering a record of 10–2 with an ERA of 1.64.\nThe Interamerican Series were held three more times, with each team winning on their home field. Mayagüez did so in 1963, in a series where Terin Pizarro recorded the only no-hitter in the history of the event, in a win over Valencia at the opening night. \nIn 1961–62, the \"Lobos de Arecibo\" joined the league as an expansion team. On January 14, 1962, Julio Navarro pitched the first regular season no-hitter.\nFor the 1962–63 season, Estadio Sixto Escobar was replaced by the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, with a larger capacity of 20,000 seats. The field dimensions were set to match the Olympic Stadium of the Montreal Expos: down the left field line, down the right field line and to center field. The outfield fences were set high.\nIn 1963–64, Clemente finished second with a batting average of .345, leading the Senadores to the title. San Juan once again played in the Interamerican Series, held in Nicaragua. In 1964–65, Orlando Cepeda joined the \"Cangrejeros\", replacing Jim Beauchamp and helping the team win the league championship. During this season, Clemente was named San Juan's player-manager, leading them to the playoffs.\nThe following season featured the debut of Jerry Morales, who won the league's Rookie of the Year award. Carlos Bernier retired in 1966, having won five stolen base titles for a total of 285 stolen bases. On November 20, 1966, San Juan's Luis de Leon pitched the first perfect game in the league's history.\nCaguas won the league championship in 1967–68. Nino Escalera, who finished his career third on the league's hit list, replaced Vic Power as the team's manager during this season. On December 20, 1969, Santurce and Arecibo participated in the only LBPPR game played outside of Puerto Rico, held in the United States Virgin Islands to honor Elrod Hendricks.\nRe-emergence in the Caribbean Series.\nPonce won the second of back-to-back championships in 1969–70 as well as the Caribbean Series’ title being led in both by Conde's offensive. The \"Cangrejeros\" won the 1970–71 championship, defeating the \"Criollos\" in the finals.\nThe 1972 All-Star game was dedicated in honor of Roberto Clemente, who had died a week before, while transporting supplies to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. Both native and foreign-born players wore a black band on their arms, as a symbol of mourning. The \"Criollos\" won the 1973–74 championship, possessing the league's strongest native lineup.\nThe \"Indios\" won the 1973–74 title and the Caribbean Series held in Mexico that year. Caguas won its ninth championship in the 1978–79 season and Bayamón won the last championship of the decade, with a roster that included batting champion Dave Bergman.\nComing back from a fourth-place regular season finish, the \"Criollos\" won their tenth championship in the 1980–81 season, but the Caribbean Series were not held that year. On January 2, 1981, Rickey Henderson established a new stolen bases record with 42. \nOrlando Gómez made his debut as a manager for Mayagüez and won the Manager of the Year award. Dickie Thon won the first of two back-to-back batting titles this season. This also marked Alomar, Sr.'s last active season, retiring forth on the fourth place of league's all-time hit leaders.\nIn 1981–82, the \"Lobos de Arecibo\" recessed and their native star players, Edwin Núñez, Candy Maldonado and Ramón Avilés were drafted by the remaining teams. The team returned the following season, winning the franchise's first championship. The team won the 1983 Caribbean Series, receiving a large welcoming ceremony at Isla Verde International Airport that included a parade from San Juan to Arecibo. \nFrom 1974 to 1983, the team hosted their games in Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel, which has 12,500 seats. Located at Route 2 and Route 5, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, the stadium has easy access with a metro station (known as \"Deportivo Station)\" on the stadium premises.\nIn 1982–83, Bayamón's Carmelo Martínez was selected MVP. Mayagüez won the 1983–84 season, with Santurce's Jerry Willard being selected MVP. Besides this, the players were rewarded with a cruise trip and met the Governor of Puerto Rico. Eduardo Figueroa led the league in ERA, winning the recognition of Comeback Player of the Year.\nFor the 1984–85 season, the \"Vaqueros\" were moved back to San Juan and re-adopted their original name, the \"Senadores de San Juan\". However, one year later they were rechristened as the \"Metros de San Juan\", a name that they conserved until 1994. The team won the LBPPR title that season. \nThe \"Metros de San Juan\" also won the Caribbean Series being led by Francisco Javier Oliveras, who won a game in the series and had previously recorded eight regular season wins and one in the semifinals. Henry Cotto of Caguas was selected the league's MVP. Rubén Sierra debuted for Santurce and won the league's Rookie of the Year award.\nOne of Puerto Rico's most successful managers, Mako Oliveras, made his managing debut in December 1984, subsequently becoming responsible for giving playing time to unknown prospects such as Benito Santiago, Edgar Martínez and Carlos Baerga, all of which would go on to become stars. Mayagüez won the 1985–86 championship.\nThis marked Roberto Alomar's debut in the LBPPR, debuting for the Criollos after being drafted by Arecibo while in high school. Caguas won the 1986–87 championship, the team went on to win the Caribbean Series, featuring a native lineup that included Alomar, Carmelo Martínez, Edgar Díaz, Germán Rivera, Henry Cotto, Orlando Mercado and Heidi Vargas.

Caguas won the 1986–87 championship and their third Caribbean Series‘ title, being led by a lineup that included Cotto and Oliveras. Mayagüez won the first of back to back titles in 1987–88.\nThe 1988 All-Star Game commemorated the league's 50th anniversary, and the game was dedicated to Angel Colon. That year, the Metro region defeated the Island region, 1–0. Mayagüez went on to win the 1988–89 title, once again led by Quiñones' clutch hitting. Javier López debuted in 1988, winning the league's Rookie of the Year recognition.\nRivalry with LBPRD and \"Dream Team\".\nSan Juan won the championship in the 1989–90 season. The season featured the debut of Juan González, who under the initiative of that season's Manager of the Year, Ramón Avilés, played every game with Caguas, finishing second in home runs with 9 and RBIs with 34. He was traded for Roberto Alomar during the off-season. González also reinforced San Juan, recording two home runs in the Caribbean Series.\nCarlos Baerga and Edgar Martínez were the co-MVP players of the 1989–90 season.\nMartínez became the first player in 41 seasons to win the batting crown with an average above.400, registering .424.\nSanturce won the title the following year, which featured the debut of Wil Cordero, who was named Rookie of the Year.\nIn the 1991–1992 season, the \"Criollos de Caguas\" franchise was moved to Bayamón, but experienced low attendance in that municipality. Due to this their star players, Juan González and Iván Rodríguez, were drafted by Santurce and Mayagüez respectively.\nThe \"Indios\" won that season's championship and the Caribbean Series held in Mexico, with Chad Kreuter winning the series’ MVP award.\nRoberto Hernandez won a tie-breaker with Venezuela to secure the series, and Cordero was recognized as the league MVP.\nThe 1992–93 season featured the return of Dickie Thon to the league, who led Santurce to a championship over San Juan in the finals as well as the debut of José \"Cheo\" Cruz as a manager. The finals series featured both Thon and Juan González, which attracted 90,369 fans throughout six games, including a record of 23,701 in the last game.\nGonzález had won consecutive batting titles in Major League Baseball and was selected the MVP after recording an average of .333 with seven home runs and 14 RBIs.

The \"Cangrejeros\" won that year's championship, repeating Puerto Rico's title in the Caribbean Series.\nThe 1994–95 season however, is most famous for the once-in-a-lifetime Dream Team, that has been compared to the Murderer's Row of the New York Yankees during the Babe Ruth era.\nThat year, the \"Senadores de San Juan\" managed by Luis \"Torito\" Meléndez won the title, subsequently assembling one of the strongest teams in the history of the Caribbean Series. \nThe group was dubbed the \"Dream Team\" and featured Major League Baseball players in most positions, including Roberto Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Bernie Williams, Juan González, Edgar Martínez, Carlos Delgado, Rubén Sierra, Rey Sánchez and Carmelo Martínez.\nPuerto Rico's offensive dominated the tournament, eventually winning the Caribbean Series championship with an undefeated record of 6–0.\nThe team won against Pedro Martínez and José Rijo in the third and sixth games respectively.\nRoberto Alomar, who had been traded to the team from Ponce for Javier López during the off-season, was named the series’ Most Valuable Player after batting 560 with two home runs.

As part of the restructuring, Major League Baseball offered to work to increase publicity.\nOn July 15, 2008, personnel from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a meeting where details about the league's merchandising were discussed.\nThe return of Pudge Rodríguez.\nIván Rodríguez (also known as \"Pudge\") is recognized as one of the greatest catchers to ever play the game. In preparation for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Pudge returned to the Puerto Rico Baseball League during the offseason, following ten years of absence.\nOn January 8, 2008, the Leones de Ponce had reclaimed Rodríguez in the last turn of a special post-season draft, where players from eliminated teams were selected to reinforce those that qualified. However, in the first week of December 2009, Rodríguez re-joined the \"Criollos de Caguas\" in the PRBL.\nPlaying for the Criollos de Caguas, he posted a batting average of .370, three RBIs and one home run in six games during the regular season. Upon leaving the team on vacation, Rodríguez announced his intention to return if the \"Criollos\" advanced to the playoffs.\nHe returned to action in a \"sudden death\" game for the final postseason space, but the team lost and was eliminated.\n2009–2010 season.\nOn October 19, 2009, the league announced a contract with WIPR-TV to broadcast its games.\nThe 2009–10 season was inaugurated on November 20, 2009, with games between Ponce and Carolina, and Arecibo versus Mayagüez-Aguadilla. This marked the first year that the league had only five active participants since 1993–94 due to the \"Cangrejeros\"' recess. During this season, the inter-league games with the Dominican Winter Baseball League continued being included in the official record books of both organizations.\n\"Indios de Mayagüez\" won the 2009–10 season, their 16th championship (the mostst in LPBPR history) when they beat the \"Criollos de Caguas\", four games to one. Three games in this series went to extra innings.\nIn this same season, the board of directors elected Sadi Antonmattei to succeed Garcia as the president of the league.\n2010–2013.\nThe Criollos de Caguas are currently the dominant team in the Puerto Rico Baseball League. They were the league champs in 2010–2011 and 2012–2013, and the Indios de Mayagüez won in 2011–2012.\nOn November 27, 2012, in a friendly softball game between nine professional ballplayers from the Puerto Rico Baseball League and nine prisoners from the Bayamón Correctional Institution, the prisoners won convincingly by a score of 10–3.\nInternational reputation.\nThe Puerto Rico National Baseball Team has participated in the World Cup of Baseball winning one gold (1951), four silver and four bronze medals.

        "text": "Robin Williams MBE (born 5 April 1959) is a Welsh professional rowing coach for Team GB. He represented Great Britain at six world championships, winning silver and bronze medals. He was coach to the Cambridge University Boat Club for 11 years winning seven Varsity Boat races. As of 2014 he is coach to the World record holders and the reigning Olympic, World, World Cup and European champions of the women's coxless pair, variously rowed by Helen Glover, Heather Stanning and Polly Swann, achieving an unbroken sequence of twelve gold medal victories at world level.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in Anglesey, Wales he learned to row on the River Wye whilst at Monmouth School (Monmouth Rowing Club), and then attended University College London where he joined the University of London Boat Club.\nCareer.\nFrom 1983 to 1987 Williams was an advertising manager for the Financial Times, plus working in the Caribbean as a salvage diver. In 2010 Williams set up \"Totally Outdoors\" in Henley, selling outdoor clothing and rowing equipment.\nRowing.\nWilliams rowed for University of London Boat Club and gained his first Great Britain vest in 1981, an international career that lasted 10 years until 1991. He won a gold medal at the Match des Seniors (Under 23 Championships) in 1981 and Silver and Bronze at the 1988 and 1989 World Rowing Championships. He has also won three Henley Royal regatta medals and 5 Lucerne regatta medals and competed at the 1986 Commonwealth Games.\nCoaching.\nIn the early '90s, whilst rowing for the London Rowing Club, he also got involved with management and coaching, working as part-time coach for three years for the Great Britain lightweights. Williams stated that \"It was a good springboard for a coaching career because we had GB rowers there. We won a lot of stuff at all levels and I think that got me established as a coach.\" In 1996 he coached the lightweight men's four to 10th place at the Olympics in Atlanta.\nIn 1994 he became coach to the Cambridge University Boat Club having rejected a similar position at the Oxford University Boat Club. Over the next 11 years his crew won the annual Boat Race seven times.\nFrom 2005 until 2009 he coached the men's lightweight crews for Team GB at Henley on Thames and the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake in Caversham, Berkshire. In 2007 the lightweight four won gold at the World Championships in Munich-Oberschleißheim, and in 2008 they came fifth at the Olympics in Beijing.\nIn July 2010 he began coaching Helen Glover and Heather Stanning in the women's coxless pair, such that by November they had improved from their world rankings of 16 and 17 to take the silver medal at the 2010 World Rowing Championships in New Zealand. In 2011 he took them to within 0.08 seconds of the gold medal at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Slovenia.\nIn 2012 Glover and Stanning won the gold medal in the Women's coxless pair at the London Olympics. In 2013 he led Glover and Polly Swann to become World champions at Chungju, South Korea. In 2014 he led Glover and Swann to the gold medal at the European Rowing Championships at Ada Ciganlija, Belgrade on 30 May. This was followed by Glover and Stanning winning the overall title in the World Rowing Cup and then becoming world champions at the 2014 World Rowing Championships held at the Bosbaan, Amsterdam. They won both their heat and the semi-final and set a new world record time of 6:50.61 in the final, breaking the 2002 time by three seconds. As of 2014 this represents an unbroken sequence of twelve gold medal victories at world level.\nFamily life.\nSince 2005 Williams has lived in Henley with his wife Anna and their two children, Lizzie and Mathew.\nHonours.\nWilliams was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to rowing. In 2016, he was named BBC Wales coach of the year."

        "text": "The men's individual road race at the 1948 Summer Olympics was held on an 11.45 km course. The course was circled seventeen times, so the total length of the competition was 194.6 km. There were 141 entries from 31 nations and 101 participants from 29 nations. Of the 101 starters, 28 rode the distance to the end. The event was won by José Beyaert of France, the nation's second consecutive victory in the men's individual road race. The Netherlands and Belgium won their first medals in the event, with Gerrit Voorting's silver and Lode Wouters's bronze, respectively.\nEach nation could enter up to four cyclists. A team classification was made, based on the rankings of the three best cyclists per nation, and this was used to determine the results of the team road race.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event, previously held in 1896 and 1936; it would be held at every Summer Olympics after 1936. It replaced the individual time trial event that had been held from 1912 to 1932 (and which would be reintroduced alongside the road race in 1996). There was no clear favorite, though Adolfo Ferrari of Italy was the reigning world champion. The race was initially intended to be held at Richmond Park in Surrey, but \"a law was discovered that prohibited any activity there at more than 20 miles per hour.\"\nArgentina, Guyana, India, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, South Korea, and Uruguay each made their debut in the men's individual road race. Great Britain made its third appearance in the event, the only nation to have competed in each appearance to date.\nCompetition format and course.\nThe mass-start race was on a course that covered 17 laps of a 11.45 kilometres circuit around Windsor Great Park, for a total of 194.63 kilometres. The course was \"relatively flat.\" It \"included no severe gradients, but was sufficiently undulating to provide a real test of stamina, and with bends . . . which needed all the skill of the contestants at the speed at which the race was run.\" The surface was less than ideal, with \"loose gravel roads\" causing numerous punctures.\nResults.\nJohansson broke away from the pack during the second lap, with Voorting and Faanhof catching him in lap 3. Johansson suffered a puncture during lap 9, falling back to the peloton. A chase group of nine cyclists caught up to Voorting and Faanhof on lap 12, but crashes and punctures dropped Faanhof, Rasmussen, and Rouffeteau out of the lead pack. Thomas was the first to attempt a breakaway, on lap 16, but was quickly caught by De Lathouwer and less-quickly caught by the rest of the pack in the last lap. Beyaert made two pushes on the last lap, being caught by the pack on the first but separating from the group on a short climb a half-mile away from the finish line; he held on to win the race. Voorting finished with a sprint for the silver medal."

        "title": "Atlantic Coast Rugby League",
        "text": "The Atlantic Coast Rugby League was an annual college rugby competition played every spring among eight universities—seven from the Atlantic Coast Conference, plus Navy (from the Patriot League). The league was disestablished in 2016.\nMember schools.\nThe current 8 member schools of the ACRL were below. Most schools are members of the ACC and joined the ACRL in its year of inception in 2011.\nNavy was the first non-ACC member, and announced in 2012 it would be joining the ACRL for the 2013 season. The University of Maryland left the ACC to join the Big Ten Conference in July 2014.\nFounding and early success.\nOrganization of college rugby has been evolving since 2009, with many schools organizing into conferences similar to the traditional NCAA conferences. In November 2010, USARFU's college management committee set out a plan for transitioning universities to NCAA style conferences. The purpose of the realignment is for college rugby to capitalize on the marketability of major college conference rivalries.\nThe ACRL is one of the first college rugby conferences that re-aligned along traditional NCAA conference lines. In March 2010, eight of the twelve schools that participate in the NCAA's Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) announced that they had formed the Atlantic Coast Rugby League (ACRL) and would begin play in spring 2011.\nThe ACRL was formed to improve rugby in the Atlantic Coast universities by capitalizing on traditional ACC rivalries, increasing the number of fans, attracting talented high school rugby players, and playing other regional schools, which would both reduce travel and create more competitive matchups with traditional college rivalries.\nThe ACRL quickly gained commercial success. The ACRL announced in February 2011, before it had even begun its inaugural season, that it has partnered with Adidas as its corporate sponsor.\nLeadership.\nPatrick Kane has served as the League Commissioner since the ACRL's founding in 2010. Kane also sits on USA Rugby's men's collegiate competition committee. Kane has been the Head Coach of the Wake Forest men's rugby team since 2004.\nResults.\nMaryland won the 2011 inaugural ACRL, defeating North Carolina 39–32 in the title match held at Charlotte RFC. Maryland, by virtue of its conference championship, qualified for the national playoffs, but lost to Florida in the Round of 16.\nIn the 2012 season, the championship was determined based on final table standings, rather than a championship match. Maryland repeated as champion, despite the loss early in the season of Matias Cima, their flyhalf and 2011 ACRL co-player of the year. Maryland and Clemson both finished with a 6–1 record, but Maryland won the league table due to the bonus point earned in its 19–22 loss to North Carolina State. Maryland, by virtue of its conference championship, qualified for the national playoffs, but lost to Tennessee in the Round of 16.\nNotes:\nAtlantic Coast Invitational (ACRL 7s).\nThe Atlantic Coast schools started moving in the direction of setting up their own conference in 2008, beginning with the Atlantic Coast Invitational tournament. The ACI tournament was co-founded by Andy Richards (Head Coach, North Carolina) and by Patrick Kane (Head Coach, Wake Forest). The ACI tournament is one of a number of college rugby tournaments that are tapping into the increased interest of sevens while also targeting traditional collegiate conference rivalries.\nThe Atlantic Coast Invitational tournament changed to a sevens format in 2010. The ACI was switched to a 7s tournament this season in response to 7s becoming an Olympic sport and in the wake of the success of the Collegiate Rugby Championship which was broadcast live by NBC.\nThe ACI tournament also experienced commercial success in 2010, landing USA Sevens as tournament sponsor.\nBeginning in 2011, the winner of the Atlantic Coast Invitational has advanced to the USA Rugby National Championship. N.C. State won the ACI tournament in 2011 defeating Virginia 24–17 in the final.\nAtlantic Coast Invitational Rugby 7s Series.\nThe Atlantic Coast Rugby League announced in March 2012 the creation of a new competition for member schools—the Atlantic Coast Invitational Rugby 7s Series—to begin in the fall of 2012. The ACRL 7s Series consists of four one-day tournaments of 8-12 teams played at various ACRL venues throughout the fall of 2012. The Series leads up to the two-day Atlantic Coast Rugby 7s Championship played later in the fall. The ACRL's reasons for developing this series was due to the increasing popularity of rugby sevens throughout the United States since the 2009 announcement that rugby sevens would be added to the Olympics. Clemson head coach Justin Hickey believes that this new Rugby 7s Series gives the ACRL \"the opportunity to set the standard on how Rugby 7s operates and competes at the collegiate level.\""

Batsmen Shahid Afridi and Younis Khan were dropped, and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria was included.\nIndia's captain Sourav Ganguly was ruled out of the side due to an injured back before the First Test.

The future Australian Test captain, Michael Clarke, made his Test debut in the first match, scoring 151 in the first innings. In the fourth match of the series, Clarke took 6 wickets for 9 runs in the second innings.\nBackground.\nThis was Australia's tenth tour of India. They had successes in the initial tours starting 1956–57, while India's successes came only in the later series. Australia had last won there in 1969–70, in their fourth visit. The tour preceding 2004–05, was in 2000–01, which ended 2–1 in India's favor, dubbed as one of India's greatest Test series wins of all time.\nThe schedule for the series was finalised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in July 2004. Australia were scheduled to play a warm-up match against Board President's XI, a three-day fixture starting 30 September. It was announced that the First Test would begin on 6 October and the final on 7 November.

Hyderabad was announced as the venue for Australia's warm-up match. In early September, Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai were announced as their opponent and that the match would be played at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai.\nIndia were coming on the back of a poor performance at the Champions Trophy. However, captain Sourav Ganguly dismissed its affects on the series and stated that \"One-dayers are one-off games. Our showing in these matches will have no bearing on the Test series\". Going into the series, his side were ranked fourth, and Australia first, in the ICC Test Team Rankings.\nSquads.\nA 16-man Australia squad was announced for the tour on 9 September 2004. It included three frontline spinners, Shane Warne, Nathan Hauritz and Cameron White, and two part-timers Simon Katich and Michael Clarke. The spin-heavy squad picked was in contract to their previous tour. Spinner Stuart MacGill, who had a poor home series against India, and paceman Shaun Tait were dropped from the squad; paceman Brett Lee was added alongside Test regulars Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. White's ability with the bat was cited by the selectors as the reason for his inclusion over MacGill, in addition to his spin bowling. His bowling had drawn comparisons to India's Anil Kumble in that he \"he generates significant bounce off the pitch and is very quick through the air, and it's a style of bowling which has proved extremely effective on Indian wickets.\" Uncapped all-rounder Shane Watson was included as a specialist batsman on the back of good performances in the Australian domestic season. Eight other specialist batsman were included in the squad, all of them being Test regulars.\nAustralia captain Ricky Ponting, who sustained a thumb injury during the Champions Trophy, was replaced by Brad Hodge for the First Test. He was later ruled out for the first two tests, and later, even the Third. Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist was elevated to captaincy and Darren Lehmann was named the vice-captain.\nThere were speculations that India's Sachin Tendulkar would not make the squad owing to his tennis elbow injury that had ruled him out of there ODI tournaments that India played preceding the Test series — the Holland triangular series, the NatWest Challenge and the Champions Trophy. However, he stated he \"really want[ed] to play\" and that he was \"hoping and praying that I am fit for the series, but it is important to be in good shape for that challenge.\" However, in the 15-man squad named by the BCCI on 1 October for the first two Tests, he was included. An injured Ashish Nehra was left out of the squad that saw three other pacemen in Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan and Ajit Agarkar, the latter of who was included owing to a good record against Australia. Mohammad Kaif, Murali Kartik, Aakash Chopra and Yuvraj Singh were other inclusions. Captain Ganguly stated that either of Singh or Chopra would open the innings for his team alongside Virender Sehwag.\nHaving not recovered in time, Tendulkar was ruled out of the First Test, a day prior of the match. This was the first time in his career that he missed a home Test match. He also missed the second Test. He returned for the Third, before conceding that he was not fully fit; \"... the elbow is obviously not a 100 percent.\" In India's squad announced for the Fourth Test, Patel, Chopra, Singh and Agarkar were excluded and four uncapped players were brought in — batsmen Gautam Gambhir, Dheeraj Jadhav and Dinesh Karthik, and paceman Shib Paul."

        "title": "Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team",
        "text": "The Antigua and Barbuda national cricket team represents the country of Antigua and Barbuda in cricket. A cricket team representing Antigua and Barbuda has been active since the late 1890s. The Antigua and Barbuda Cricket Association is a member of the Leeward Islands Cricket Association, which itself is a member association of the West Indies Cricket Board, and players from Antigua and Barbuda generally represent the Leeward Islands cricket team at domestic level and the West Indies at international level. The team made its List A debut at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, and its Twenty20 debut at the 2006 Stanford 20/20 tournament. As of 2015, the team has played 14 List A matches and four Twenty20 matches. The team captain is Sylvester Joseph, while Ridley Jacobs is the team coach.\nHistory.\nIn the mid-1890s, several touring English amateur sides played matches against Antiguan representative sides. R. S. Lucas' XI toured in 1895, winning by an innings and 69 runs, and A. A. Priestley's and Lord Hawke's XIs both toured in early 1897, winning by an innings and 96 runs and 259 runs, respectively. Part of the colony of the British Leeward Islands until 1958, and a member of the West Indies Federation between 1958 and 1962, Antigua played almost exclusively in the Leewards Islands Tournament, with occasional matches against touring teams, which included a \"New Zealand Ambassadors\" team in 1970, Kent in 1973 and 1979, and Canada in 1976. At West Indian domestic level, Antiguan and Barbudan cricketers represented the Leeward Islands cricket team, which debuted in the Shell Shield, the domestic first-class competition, in 1958. The Leeward Islands and the Windward Islands participated together as the Combined Islands cricket team from 1965 to 1981, when they separated again. Antigua and Barbuda gained independence in 1981, and from then on participated as \"Antigua and Barbuda\". The team toured Bermuda in September 1984, drawing a three-day match with the Bermuda national team.\nAt the 1998 Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Antigua and Barbuda fielded a separate team at the cricket tournament, as did Jamaica and Barbados. Matches at the tournament had List A status. Antigua and Barbuda were drawn in Group B, along with Australia, Canada, and India. The team's first match, against India at the Tenaga National Sports Complex, finished in a no-result due to rain. The team was captained by Dave Joseph, and included seven West Indies international players: Curtly Ambrose, Eldine Baptiste, Kenny Benjamin, Winston Benjamin, Ridley Jacobs, Sylvester Joseph, and Richie Richardson. After losing to Australia and defeating Canada, Antigua and Barbuda finished second in Group B over India due to a higher net run rate, but did not qualify for the semi-finals. The team's leading run-scorer at the games was Ridley Jacobs, who scored 74 runs, and the leading wicket-taker was Anthony Lake.\nAs part of a reorganisation of the structure of cricket in the West Indies, Antigua and Barbuda, along with the other Leeward and Windward Islands constituent members, fielded teams at the Red Stripe Bowl, the domestic one-day tournament, in the 2001–02, 2002–03, and 2003–04 seasons. The team was largely unsuccessful, and did not progress beyond the group stage. Antigua and Barbuda also participated in the Stanford 20/20 tournament in 2006 and 2008, being knocked out in the quarter-finals in both instances. The team played a number of matches against touring sides in the mid-2000s, including against England, Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and India cricket team.\nGrounds.\nThe traditional home ground of Antigua and Barbuda is the Antigua Recreation Ground \"(pictured)\", the national stadium of the country, which has hosted a number of Test and One-Day International matches. Two further grounds, the Stanford Cricket Ground and Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, were constructed in 2004 and 2006 for use in the Stanford 20/20 and 2007 World Cup respectively, and have both been used in inter-island matches featuring Antigua and Barbuda.\nPlayers.\nInternational Players.\nA number of Antigua players have represented the West Indies internationally.\nStanford Twenty20 Players: 2006 &amp; 2008.\nsource: "

        "text": "Michael Kent Hooper (born 29 October 1991) is an Australian professional rugby union player who is the former captain of the Australia national team, the Wallabies. His primary position is openside flanker.\nHooper is one of Australia's most-capped players of all time and played for the New South Wales Waratahs in Super Rugby from 2013-2023. He currently plays for the Australian national rugby sevens team. Hooper has previously represented the Brumbies and Toyota Verblitz in his professional career.\nEarly life.\nHooper was born on 29 October 1991 in Sydney, and played his junior rugby at the Manly Roos like other former Wallabies such as George Smith. Hooper represented Australia under 20 at the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship where he captained the side at times and was named International Player of the Tournament.\nProfessional career.\nSuper Rugby.\nHooper made his Brumbies debut in 2010, as stand-in for the injured George Smith.\nAfter a breakout season for the Brumbies in 2012, he was signed by the New South Wales Waratahs for the 2013 season. 2012 had been a standout year for Hooper who won numerous accolades including Best Forward (for the Brumbies), the ARU's Rookie of Year and placing third for the John Eales Medal after playing less than half of the polling games.\nIn 2013, Hooper played every Waratahs Super Rugby game of the season and he won the Australian Super 15 Player of the Year award, as well as the Waratahs' Player of the Year award.\non the 1st of March 2014, Hooper was named captain for the Waratahs' clash with the Queensland Reds after team regular Dave Dennis was ruled out due to injury received in the Waratahs' first game of 2014 against the Western Force. Hooper led the Waratahs to a 32–5 win over the Reds at ANZ Stadium and went on to play all the remaining games of the 2014 season including the Grand Final against the Crusaders in which he captained the side to a 33–32 win at ANZ Stadium.\nTop League.\nIn August 2020 it was announced that Hooper had signed to play for the Japanese Top League club Toyota Verblitz for the 2020–21 season, marking his first serious move to play domestic rugby outside the Super Rugby since starting his career with the Brumbies in 2010.\nInternational.\nOn 5 June 2012, Hooper made his international debut for Australia, coming off the bench (in the 65th minute) against Scotland in Newcastle. Following a knee injury to regular flanker and captain David Pocock, Hooper started in every Test game until the final Spring-Tour game (and Nathan Sharpe's final Wallabies game) against Wales in Cardiff, where he started from the bench to make-way for David Pocock. Hooper won Wallabies 'Rookie of the year' award at the annual John Eales Medal awards evening event.\nIn 2013, when David Pocock suffered a season-ending knee injury; Hooper played in all of the Wallabies Test matches and had an outstanding year, winning the John Eales Medal as 'Wallabies player of the year'.\nIn 2014, Pocock suffered another season-ending knee injury and in Ewen McKenzie's second year as Wallabies coach, McKenzie named Hooper as vice-captain with his Waratahs team-mate Adam Ashley-Cooper and his former Brumbies team-mate Stephen Moore was named as Australia captain for the 2014 three-test June series against France. However, when captain Stephen Moore left the field with a knee injury in the 5th minute, Hooper took over the captaincy for the rest of the game. During the game, he scored a try in the first half and he had a strong performance against France in the Wallabies' 50–23 win at Suncorp Stadium. Hooper was rated was one of the best players on the field during the game by Iain Payten of foxsports.com.au and was also labelled 'the Energizer Bunny of world rugby'.\nFollowing the season-ending injury to Stephen Moore during the first test of 2014 against France in Brisbane, Hooper was named as Wallabies captain for the rest of the 2014 Test-season, meaning that he was the Wallabies 82nd Test captain and the youngest player (age 23, 233 days) to captain the side since Ken Catchpole (age 21, 354 days) in 1961.\nFollowing another strong 2015 Super Rugby season, Hooper was awarded the Peoples Choice – Wallaby of the Year at the John Eales Medal awards night for the second year in a row. He also kept his starting position safe, forcing David Pocock into Number 8 after returning from injury. He was also selected in the 31-man 2015 Rugby World Cup squad.\nIn 2016, Hooper was again awarded the John Eales Medal, the 4th player to have won it a second time.\nHooper became the full-time Wallabies captain for the 2017 Rugby Championship, following Stephen Moore announcing that the 2017 season would be his final year of test rugby.\nHis very rough playing style has led Hooper to collect nine yellow cards in his international career, matched in this unenviable record only by the Georgian Viktor Kolelishvili.\nIn 2020, Hooper played his 100th test for Australia, becoming the fastest Wallaby to reach 100 tests. He also became the youngest-ever player to reach 100 tests for his country, although his record was later broken by Wales' centre, George North. Hooper's 100th test was a 16–16 draw with New Zealand, at the Wellington Regional Stadium. He went on to play all 6 of Australia's tests in 2020, under the new Head Coach, Dave Rennie.\nIn 2021, Hooper surpassed George Gregan's record for the most caps as Wallabies captain, 60.\nIn August 2023, Hooper was omitted from the Australian squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. At that time, Hooper was the fastest player to 50 caps and longest serving Wallabies captain Wallabies coach Eddie Jones cited Hooper's calf injury as a reason for his omission.\nHonours.\nWaratahs\nPersonal life.\nHis father is from Kent, England. Hooper grew up in Collaroy on the Northern Beaches of Sydney and currently resides in Manly."

        "title": "Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society",
        "text": "The Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society is a group of Oxford and Cambridge sailing Blues and Half Blues. Their influence on UK and international sailing, particularly team racing, has been quite disproportionate to their small numbers of just over 300 people. Since the founding of the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society (O&amp;CSS) in 1934, members have competed in 13 Sailing Olympics and won eight medals (three gold, three silver, and two bronze).\nThe Society (O&amp;CSS) was formed in 1934 by Cambridge Half Blue Stewart Morris, along with three of his contemporaries; Morris was later to win a gold medal at the 1948 Olympics. The aim of the Society was \"to keep members of the two Clubs together after coming down from the University, and encourage team racing throughout the country, at the same time maintaining a high standard of helmsmanship\". The two Clubs referred to are the Oxford University Yacht Club (founded in 1884) and the Cambridge University Cruising Club (founded in 1893).\nThe Society has always limited its membership; 24 sailors were elected in the first year and since then four to ten of the best sailors from Oxford and Cambridge have been elected each year as they graduate. Occasionally non-blues are elected because of their later achievements in either competitive sailing or sailing administration. Good histories exist of the Society and of the Oxford University Yacht Club (1884–1994 and 1994–2009) – available in some libraries and from their author. A brief history of the Cambridge University Cruising Club is maintained on that club's website.\nInternational honours.\nLike many sports in the 1930s, Oxford and Cambridge students and alumni competed at the highest sailing levels. In the 1936 Olympic yachting trials, half of the recently-formed Society's membership took part. Since then, Society members, usually after their student days, have continued to compete with success at the highest levels in sailing. In 2011 the top three sailors in the International 14 Dinghy World Championships were all members of the Society, as was the OK dinghy World Champion and Yachtsman of the Year, Nick Craig. The skipper of the winning Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing entry in the 2014/15 Volvo (round-the-world) Ocean Race and two-times Olympic silver medallist, Ian Walker, is a member. Five-times winner of the International 14 World Championships, Archie Massey, is also a member, as is Nick Craig, five-times winner of the OK Dinghy World Championships.\nIt is unlikely that any UK sailing club, particularly one that has had such a small membership, can boast of such a record. Details of the Society's Olympic involvement are tabled below.\nJonathan Janson, having competed in 1956 and 1960, was also involved in most of the subsequent Olympic regattas up to 1992 as a Vice President of the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU) – now World Sailing. His duties including overseeing the pre-Olympic regattas, International Jury service, and other roles.\nThe following sailors have represented the UK in the biennial World Team Racing Championships.\nTeam racing.\nWhile the Society's involvement with the Olympics is the most public testimony of its contribution to sailing, it is the discipline of team racing that is at the Society's heart. A good general history of team racing is available on the Wikipedia article on team racing.\nFounder Stewart Morris had experienced the occasional team race in his youth on the Norfolk Broads, where the professional skippers raced against their amateur owners from time to time. When he went up to Cambridge in October 1927, he sailed in three Varsity Match against Oxford (1928–1930), and experienced intense team racing competition, fuelled by traditional Light Blue–Dark Blue rivalry. The sailing Varsity Match was first held in 1912, but was interrupted between 1915 and 1919 by the First World War and in 1940 by the Second World War. Over the years, the standard and tactics of the team racing improved considerably, and great rivalry existed between the University teams. A fuller history of the match will be found on the O&amp;CSS website.\nStewart's desire to bring together members of both teams to continue team racing, and to promote this aspect of the sport, was the reason for forming the Society. By organising matches against other sailing clubs, the Society began to promote team racing and, in time, facilitated the development of events such as the West Kirby Sailing Club Wilson Trophy. That event is now the single most prestigious open team racing event in the UK, with an international entry and reputation. The Society's vital role is referred to in the record of West Kirby's initial planning meeting: \"Support would have to be gained from the Oxford &amp; Cambridge Sailing Society, which was the most important body sponsoring team racing.\", and (Sir) Cyril Clarke, one of the three West Kirby helmsmen who provided the stimulus for the first 'Wilson' event, was a member.\nSince then, team racing has grown both in popularity and skill levels, with the sport becoming international and a Team Racing World Championships starting in 1995. The UK Royal Yachting Association and UK Team Racing Association (UKTRA) actively promotes team racing and holds an annual UK Championship and Ladies Championship. There is also an annual British Universities Sailing Association Team Racing Championship, contested after several rounds of regional qualifiers. UK schools are also active with annual championships organised via the British Schools Dinghy Racing Association, and the National Schools Sailing Association. Society members play a leading role in the organisation of all these events, and the Society's Ladies team won the UK National Ladies Championships four times during the five years 2004—2008, and again in 2013. Furthermore, Bruce Hebbert, the instigator of the European 2K Keel Boat Team Racing Series, is a member.\nVintage port.\nOne less serious aspect of the Club is also worth commenting on. In 1936, a member donated 48 bottles of vintage port for consumption at the annual dinner. Grateful members subsequently elected him President for a term, and in 1946 the Society started investing its own funds in vintage port. This ‘liquid’ investment strategy has proved most successful. Excellent port is available at annual dinners at extremely low cost, the Society's reserves have steadily appreciated, and bottles of port are occasionally sold to provide funds to buy newer vintages for future generations to enjoy."

He was raised in Medford, Oregon, and attended Medford High School. There, he was a standout American football player and track and field athlete, winning three state titles in hurdling. After graduating in 1950, Morris studied at the University of Oregon. He joined the US Air Force after completing his freshman year and consequently served in the Korean War. Upon his return from military service, he established an Oregon Ducks record with 68 points in a single season and started his school-record 23 straight successful conversions. He then led the team with 519 rushing yards the following year, and became co-captain of the team by his senior year. At the time of his graduation, he was ranked third all-time at Oregon in points scored (130) and rushing yards (1,631). Morris was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the seventh round (84th overall selection) of the 1956 NFL Draft.\nCareer.\nMorris made his NFL debut with the Rams on September 28, 1958, at the age of 26, in a 30–27 loss against the Cleveland Browns. During his rookie season, he finished second in the league in interceptions returned for touchdown (1), fourth in interception return yards (152), and seventh in interceptions (6), longest interception return (44 yards), and defensive touchdowns (1). He also led the franchise in interceptions that year. After just under three seasons with the franchise, he joined the Pittsburgh Steelers midway through the 1960 season. He then joined the newly-established Minnesota Vikings the following year and recorded the third-longest interception return in the NFL (65 yards).\nMorris was part of the inaugural class inducted into Medford's Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. Twenty years later, he was enshrined in the University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame, having earlier been honored as part of the 1957 Ducks football team when they were inducted in 1994.\nPersonal life.\nMorris was married to Lois until his death. Together, they had four children: Tricia, Dana, Jolie, and Carl.\nMorris showed signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy during his later years. He died on April 27, 2022, at his home in Redmond, Oregon. He was 90, and suffered from Alzheimer's disease prior to his death."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of ten fencing events on the fencing at the 2000 Summer Olympics programme. It was the twenty-third appearance of the event. The competition was held on 20 September 2000. 40 fencers from 22 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by Kim Yeong-Ho of South Korea, the first Asian man to win an Olympic fencing title. Ralf Bißdorf of Germany took silver, the first medal for united Germany since 1928 (though East and West Germany had each won medals separately). Dmitry Shevchenko's bronze medal was Russia's first as an independent nation in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 23rd appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Four of the eight quarterfinalists from 1996 returned: silver medalist Lionel Plumenail of France, fourth-place finisher Wolfgang Wienand of Germany, fifth-place finisher Rolando Tucker of Cuba, sixth-place finisher (and 1992 silver medalist) Sergei Golubitsky of Ukraine, and eighth-place finisher Kim Young-ho of South Korea. Golubitsky was the favorite, having won all three world championships between Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000. Kim was a serious contender as well, rising from an unknown giant-killer (knocking off then-reigning world champion Dmitriy Shevchenko of Russia in the 1996 Games) to a giant himself (taking second in the 1997 and third in the 1999 world championships). Shevchenko returned as well, hoping for a better result than his early exit in Atlanta.\nFor the first time in the event's history, no nations made their debut in the men's foil. France and the United States each made their 21st appearance, tied for most of any nation; France had missed only the 1904 (with fencers not traveling to St. Louis) and the 1912 (boycotted due to a dispute over rules) foil competitions, while the United States had missed the inaugural 1896 competition and boycotted the 1980 Games altogether.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1996 tournament had vastly simplified the competition format into a single-elimination bracket, with a bronze medal match. The 2000 tournament continued to use that format. Bouts were to 15 touches. Standard foil rules regarding target area, striking, and priority were used.\nResults.\nThe field of 40 fencers competed in a single-elimination tournament to determine the medal winners. Semifinal losers proceeded to a bronze medal match."

On March 8, 2013, the \"Catholic 7\" and the remaining Big East schools announced a separation agreement. Under the agreement, the \"Catholic 7\" purchased the Big East name and the contract with Madison Square Garden for the conference tournament, and began operating under the Big East name beginning on July 1, 2013.

In February 1991, they agreed to the creation of the unified table tennis team to compete at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships. According to Chang Ung, International Olympic Committee member from North Korea, the decision took 22 rounds of talks between the Koreas and five months.\nThe team used \"Korea\" (Korean hangul: , McCune–Reischauer: \"K'oria\", Revised Romanization: \"Koria\", Japanese: \"Koria\") as the country name avoiding \"Hanguk\" () or \"Chosŏn\" (). It also used the Korean Unification Flag as the national flag and Arirang as the national anthem. Upon defeating the supposedly \"unbeatable\" Chinese team, the women's team caused a big sensation in Korea.\nA South Korean movie \"Korea\" () (\"As one\") was released on May 3, 2012, and describes the story of the women's team.

The tournament is split into four regional tournaments, and each regional has teams seeded from 1 to 16, with the committee ostensibly making every region as comparable to the others as possible. The top-seeded team in each region plays the #16 team, the #2 team plays the #15, etc. (meaning where the two seeds add up to 17, that team will be assigned to play another).\nThe basis for the subregionals returned to the approach used between 1982 and 2002; the top sixteen teams, as chosen in the bracket selection process, hosted the first two rounds on campus.\nThe Selection Committee will also seed the entire field from 1 to 64.\nSelections for the 2017 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship were announced at 7 p.m. Eastern time, Monday, March 13 via ESPN.\nSubregionals tournament and automatic qualifiers.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams automatically qualified for the 2017 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nESPN had US television rights to all games during the tournament.

The Championships were the 52nd edition of the World Table Tennis Championships.\nThese were the first Championships since 2003 in which China did not win all five competitions and the first since 1993 in which they won fewer than four gold medals. China's ten-Championships long streak of men's doubles titles came to an end as Chuang Chih-yuan and Chen Chien-an of Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) beat a Chinese duo for their nation's first-ever gold medal. China's eleven-Championships long streak of mixed doubles titles (since 1989) came to an end as Kim Hyok-Bong and Kim Jong of North Korea beat a South Korean team in the finals. However, China did have the top four finishers in both the men's and women's singles and won 14 of 20 medals overall.\nZhang Jike took the men's title, marking his fourth consecutive World or Olympic first-place finish, while Li Xiaoxia won her first World title in the women's singles. Li also teamed up with Guo Yue to win the women's doubles title for China.\nHost.\nDoha, one of the only two candidate cities, withdrew its bid after the Qatar Table Tennis Association was made aware that Paris wanted to mark the 10-year anniversary of the 2003 World Table Tennis Championships. As a result, Paris was selected as the host city. The decision was announced by ITTF in May 2010. The tournament was held at the 12,000 seat Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\nSchedule.\nFive different events were contested at the Championships. Qualification rounds were held from May 13 to 14.\nResults.\nEntering the 2013 World Table Tennis Championship, China had not lost a single event since 2003 when Werner Schlager of Austria won the men's singles.\nBoth men's semi-finals featured a matchup of two highly ranked Chinese players. In the first, the fourth-seed Zhang Jike dominated the world number-one Xu Xin in a victory of four sets to none (11–8, 11–2, 11–9, 12–10). In the other semi-final, the third-seed Wang Hao triumphed four sets to two (11–9, 11–7, 11–3, 7–11, 12–14, 11–3) over the second-ranked Ma Long.\nIn the men's singles final, Zhang Jike beat his countryman Wang Hao 4–2 to claim his fourth straight major title. Zhang won the first set 11–7 and the second 11–8. Wang bounced back to take the third set 11–6. He continued his surge in the fourth set, taking an early lead and going up 10–7. However, Zhang maintained his composure, saving 4 setpoints, and took the hard-fought set 14–12. Wang took the fifth set 11–5 to stay alive in the best of seven match, before Zhang finished the match with an 11–7 fifth set, winning six points in a row at the end. The victorious Zhang threw his shirt into the crowd and run into the stands to celebrate with his parents who had never attended a world competition event before. \"My parents had always wanted to watch me play during major world competitions, but I refused. This time I asked them to come here\", he explained.\nZhang had previously won the 2011 World Cup and 2012 Olympic Games, both also over Wang, as well as the 2011 World Championships. He has never lost to Wang in international competition. After the match, Wang announced it was his last World Championships, as he plans to retire in the near future.\nIn men's doubles, Chuang Chih-yuan and Chen Chien-an captured Chinese Taipei's (Taiwan) first ever gold medal. The duo topped Ma Lin and Hao Shuai of China four sets to two. Ma and Hao won the first set 11–9, before dropping three in a row to Chuang and Chen (12–10, 11–6, 13–11). After Ma and Hao won the fifth set 11–9, Chuang and Chen finished off the match with an 11–8 sixth set. The secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Table Tennis Association called the victory \"an important milestone in our table tennis history,\" and the Taipei government awarded Chaung and Chen NT$900,000 (US$30,033) each for their accomplishment. Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou remarked \"It’s a hard-won achievement that highlights the Taiwan spirit of perseverance and fortitude.\" Chinese Taipei had been competing in world championships since 1985. The country's previous best finish was second place in women's single by Chen Jing twenty years prior. China had won the men's doubles in the last ten World Championships.\nIn women's singles, Li Xiaoxia of China claimed her first World Championships with a four set to two victory over compatriot Liu Shiwen. Li won the first set 11–8, but Liu bounced back with an easy 11–4 second set victory. Li captured the third set 11–7 and fourth 12–10. Liu stayed alive with an 11–6 fifth set and fended off two match point in the sixth before falling 13–11. Li had previously finished second at the World Championships in 2011 and 2007. Her victory allowed her to complete a career glad slam (World Cup, Olympic title, and World Championships). For Liu, it was her first World Championship Final appearance. Ding Ning and rising star Zhu Yuling, both also from China, took the bronze medals.\nThe day after Li won the single's title, she joined with Guo Yue to add the women's double gold to her medal haul. Ding Ning and Liu Shiwen, also from China, took the first set 11–5, but it was all Li and Guo from there. Li and Guo, who are close friends, won the second set 11–5, and then the next three sets 11–7, 11–5, and 11–7, for a four set to one victory. Singapore's Feng Tianwei and Yu Mengyu took one of bronzes, with the other going to Chen Meng and Zhu Yuling if China.\nEntering the World Championships, China had won eleven straight mixed doubles titles (since 1989). However, no Chinese team made the finals in 2013. Instead, Kim Hyok-Bong and Kim Jong of North Korea beat Lee Sang-Su and Park Young-Sook of South Korea 4–2. The North Korean team won the first three sets, before dropping two straight. They recovered from their slide and won the match in the sixth set. It was the first-ever mixed doubles title for the nation and the first world title of any kind in 36 years."

        "text": "Rugby boys () are a collective term for gangs of street children found in the Philippines. They are one of the most well-known poverty-afflicted people found in the slums of the Philippines. They are known for using and being addicted to a contact cement known as \"Rugby\" brand manufactured by Bostik and other aromatic solvents to alleviate their hunger, and resulting in crime to fund their addiction.\nData from the Philippine Department of Social Welfare and Development show that the number of street children increased by 6,365 yearly, and half of the country’s street children, from 8 to 20 years old, have at one time sniffed Rugby and other inhalants. The relative ease of procuring these substances due to their low cost contributes to widespread abuse. There is no comprehensive epidemiologic data on the magnitude of inhalant abuse among children and adolescents in the Philippines.\nIn response to widespread abuse of toluene-based substances, stricter rules have been imposed on the manufacture and sale of Rugby and similar glues by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, such as the mandatory addition of mustard oil as a sniffing deterrent. In addition, purchasers will now be required to present valid identification for them to have access to contact cement that doesn't contain any bitterants or other such deterrents.\nHistory.\nIn terms of addiction, inhalants are ordinary household products such as cleaners, cooking sprays, fabric protectors, paint thinner, and adhesives and solvents. Because of the low cost of Rugby and other inhalants, poor people (especially inexperienced and destitute youths) use them to relieve hunger pangs and common poverty health problems. “Rugby Boys” (also called “Solvent Boys”), which despite the name refers to children irrespective of gender, openly engage in the consumption of such inhalants. The chemical is placed in a plastic bag and inhaled from the bag to achieve euphoria.\nThe impoverished population is the most common victim of addiction to dangerous and illegal substances. Once they are \"high\" they forget their hunger. Others become addicted because of family problems, poor self-esteem, and peer pressure. Solvents, particularly Rugby, is the inhalant of choice in the Philippines for most teenagers since it is easily obtained. Less scrupulous store owners sell the adhesive in small portions to children and teenagers.\nHealth problems.\nInhalants cause nausea, blurred vision, memory lapse, and loss of motor coordination. These effects may be a minor discomfort to the user after inhalation, but permanent damage from inhalants is irreversible. Damage to organs such as the liver, kidneys, brain, and heart could be fatal.\nA documentary by Karen Davila showed the effects of inhalant abuse on a person's body.\nThe chemical toluene provides the aromatic smell of contact cement and other glue and is the culprit behind the addiction. Toluene abusers are exposed to levels above 1000 ppm (parts per million). Levels of exposure greater than 600 ppm cause confusion and delirium. Inhalant abuse causes permanent damage to the brain and may result in “sudden sniffing death”. It can also cause loss of memory, confusion or disorientation, distorted perception of time and distance, hallucinations, nausea,emesis and Psychoorganic syndrome. Inhalant abuse leads to muscle cramps and weakness, numbness of limbs, abdominal pains, damage to the central nervous system, kidneys and liver. It also produces psychological dependence. Once the habit is formed, the dose must be increased gradually to produce the same effect.\nCrimes attributed.\nMany Rugby boys have resorted to crime to fund their addiction. These crimes include robbery, aggressive threats and hold-ups, drug trafficking, and racketeering, and small organized crimes.\nMany of their crimes occur in crowded public places when the police are distracted."

        "text": "Tanner James Smith (born March 30, 1990) is a former American professional basketball player and is currently an assistant coach for Appalachian State.\nSmith played professionally for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in the Basketball Bundesliga in Germany and Landstede Basketball in the Netherlands. He played for Clemson University.\nSmith has been noted by such sources as The Post and Courier, The Times and Democrat, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for founding Tanner's Totes, an organization that helps to cheer up children and teenagers with cancer through donations of large tote bags filled with toys and other recreational items. Tanner's Totes have delivered to hospitals in 25 states across the US. Over 3000 totes have been delivered. Smith has also been interviewed by ESPN in print and in televised interviews and has been featured on the ABC special \"Everyday Health\".\nTanner Smith graduated in December 2011 with a degree in Marketing and finished playing his final season at Clemson as a graduate student.\nCollege career.\nTanner Smith started three seasons as a Guard on the Clemson Tigers men's basketball team.

He was rated as a 3-star prospect in high school and as the #22 small forward in the nation by Scout.com and given a Scout Grade of 87 on ESPN.com. He was also rated 16th in the state of Georgia by Rivals.com, two spots lower than his teammate and roommate at Clemson, Andre Young.\nWhen considering schools, Smith chose Clemson mainly because of location; It was far enough away from home for him to be independent, but still close enough that his parents would be able to come to his games. Conference also played a part in his decision. Clemson is in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), which Dana O'Neil says is \"a league Tanner remembers watching as a kid.\"\nAwards.\nThroughout his college career, Tanner Smith has earned numerous awards, including but not limited to the 2011 C. J. Spiller Award given to a student-athlete chosen by the Clemson University student body for exceptional representation of the school through athletics and academics; the Mr. Effort Award his junior year given to the athlete that exhibits the most \"hustle\"; and the 2011 Tiger Pride Award, given to the Clemson athlete who best embodies the term \"student athlete\". He is also a four-time member of the All-ACC Academic Team, making him only the second player in Clemson history to make the team all four years.\nProfessional career.\nSmith played his first professional season in the Dutch Basketball League, playing for Landstede Basketbal from Zwolle. In July 2013, Smith signed with MHP RIESEN Ludwigsburg in Germany.\nCoaching career.\nTanner Smith began coaching in 2014 serving as the Graduate Assistant for Mississippi State basketball team. He became the Director of Operations at Charlotte 49ers for two seasons before being promoted to a full-time assistant coach in 2017.\nIn 2018, Tanner Smith joined Mississippi State as Director of Basketball Operations. In 2019, he joined Kennesaw State as Assistant coach.\nHonors.\n Landstede Basketbal\nTanner's Totes.\nTanner's Totes is a non-profit organization that works to cheer up children and teens with cancer undergoing long-term treatment in the hospital through the donation of large tote bags filled with new, non-food items. It is an IRS-approved, publicly supported 501(c)(3) organization. In the fourth grade, Tanner Smith was assigned to write a paper about his three wishes. In it, he wrote that he wished for a golden retriever, to become a professional basketball player, and to help kids with cancer. Tanner's Totes was established two years later, when Smith was in the sixth grade, after he reiterated his wish to cheer up kids with cancer."

Held annually in mid-March, the tournament usually presents a high level in terms of player rankings, similar or even higher than some ATP 250 Series tournaments. This occurs because the tournament is scheduled in-between the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open. This way, Top 50 players and below that are eliminated early at Indian Wells come to play in Irving. The first two editions of the tournaments were named Dallas Tennis Classic, but the tournament has been held at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas since its first edition. As the Resort is actually located in Irving, the tournament was renamed in 2014 to reflect that. The official playing surface of the tournament is SportMaster Sport Surfaces.\nPrestigious players that played in Irving include Marin Čilić, Tommy Haas, Jürgen Melzer, and David Goffin."

He started for the side that defeated Wales in the final of the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship to become youth world champions for the first time. In January 2014 Slade made his debut at England 'A' level against Ireland Wolfhounds.\nIn June 2014 Slade scored fifteen points for England in an uncapped game against the Barbarian at Twickenham. He was included in the preliminary training squad by coach Stuart Lancaster for the 2015 Rugby World Cup and on 15 August 2015 won his first cap for England, partnering Sam Burgess in midfield during a warm-up victory over France. He was selected for the World Cup and scored his first international try on his only appearance during the tournament in their final pool game against Uruguay.\nA broken leg suffered playing for Exeter in December 2015 meant Slade did not feature for new coach Eddie Jones until the 2016 autumn internationals against Fiji and Argentina. He made his first Six Nations appearance against Italy during the 2017 tournament which England retained.

Later that year he scored a try in an Autumn Nations Cup match against Wales and then started in the final of the competition as England defeated France in extra-time to lift the trophy.\nIn 2021 Slade failed to be selected for the British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa.\nPersonal life.\nSlade's mother is Jayne and he is the oldest of three boys, his brother Seb (b.1995) is an actor, and the youngest, Albert (b.2000), is a rugby player and student.\nSlade has Type 1 diabetes, and often injects insulin at half-time in a game.\nSlade is the great nephew of former Portsmouth F.C. footballer Geoff Williamson.\nIn March 2020, Slade and his wife, Megan, announced that they were expecting their first child. On 14 August 2020, Megan gave birth to a daughter, Olive Margot Slade. Slade announced the birth of their second daughter, Orli in September 2023.\nSlade has been criticised for comments he made in an interview in May 2021 where he stated that he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19. He has since made a statement through his club clarifying that his remarks were not to be taken as opposition to the Government's vaccine roll-out."

Despite prolific scoring for the era, Michigan finished in a tie for fifth in the Big Ten Conference.

However, the team went 3–7 in the second half of the season for a season record of 12–8, and 6–6 against Big Ten opponents.\nOne of the highlights of the season was a tour of the east during the winter break. Michigan played and defeated Maryland, Rochester, and a highly touted Dartmouth team on the trip. The Wolverines held Dartmouth to one point in the first half and led 21–1 at halftime. While the second half of the season was a disappointment, the Wolverines had scored their highest single game total in a 58–29 over Wisconsin on February 21, 1938.\nFranklin \"Cappy\" Cappon was in his seventh and final year as the team's coach. Cappon had played basketball and football at Michigan from 1919 to 1923. As a senior, he was awarded the Western Conference Medal for all-around excellence in both athletics and academics. After seven seasons as Michigan's head coach, Cappon served as the head basketball coach from 1938 to 1961 at Princeton University, where he mentored Butch van Breda Kolff, Bill Bradley and Frank Deford.

His career total of 571 points also broke Karpus's career scoring record of 338 points. Townsend was selected as a consensus All-American the end of the 1937–38 season. Townsend later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League for the Indianapolis Kautskys, Oshkosh All-Stars and Rochester Royals.\nOn March 8, 1938, the day after the season's final game, Coach Cappon announced that he had accepted the head coaching job at Princeton."

The team scored 741 points in 20 games for an average of 37.1 points per game – the highest point total and scoring per game in school history up to that time. Michigan finished in third place in the Big Ten.\nThe team opened the season with a 61–12 victory over Michigan Normal (now known as Eastern Michigan University), setting a new scoring record at Yost Field House. During the winter break, the team traveled to Seattle, Washington, to play three games against the University of Washington. Team captain Johnny Gee (who later played professional baseball and basketball), was unavailable to play during the west coast trip due to a broken nose. Michigan won two out of the three games in Seattle.\nFranklin \"Cappy\" Cappon was in his sixth year as the team's coach. Cappon had played basketball and football at Michigan from 1919 to 1923. As a senior, he was awarded the Western Conference Medal for all-around excellence in both athletics and academics. After seven seasons as Michigan's head coach, Cappon served as the head basketball coach from 1938 to 1961 at Princeton University, where he mentored Butch van Breda Kolff, Bill Bradley and Frank Deford. He compiled a combined record of 340–242 at Michigan and Princeton and was inducted into the Helms Foundation College Basketball Hall of Fame in 1957.\nJohn \"Jake\" Townsend, a six-foot, four inch center from Indiana, was the team leading scorer for three straight seasons. He scored 154 points during the 1935–36 season, 191 points during the 1936–37 season, and 226 points during the 1937-38 season. Townsend's 191 points during the 1936–37 season broke the school's single season scoring record of 181 points set by Arthur Karpus in the 1918–19 season. His career total of 571 points also broke Karpus's career scoring record of 338 points. Townsend was selected as a unanimous All-Big Ten player at the end of the 1936–37 season and later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League for the Indianapolis Kautskys, Oshkosh All-Stars and Rochester Royals."

        "text": "Tom Kingston (born 19 June 1991) is an Australian professional rugby footballer. His usual position is outside centre or wing. He signed on to play for the Melbourne Rebels in 2014.\nEarly life.\nKingston first started playing Rugby in Hong Kong and when his family returned to Australia he played junior rugby for the Mosman Whales before moving to play for the Manly Roos. He showed promise in his junior rugby career while at St Aloysius' College. His performances earned him selection in the Australian U16 Merit Side in 2007. Despite impressing selectors as a 17-year-old, Kingston missed out on playing for the Australian Schoolboys side in 2008, following a collarbone injury. He was selected in 2009 and earned four caps for his country.\nRugby career.\nIn 2011 he made his debut for the New South Wales Waratahs, and later that year was selected in the Australian Under 20s side to play in the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship in Italy.\nHe was also selected for the Australian Sevens side in 2011, but had to forgo the opportunity to tour due to his commitments with the Waratahs.\nKingston became a regular for the Waratahs in 2012. On the back of strong performances, he was named in the media as a potential candidate for the Wallabies but did not gain selection. In late May 2013, he signed a two-year deal to join the Melbourne Rebels, starting in the 2014 Super Rugby season.\nHe competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nHonours.\nIndividual\nSmartest man in rugby.\nThere was speculation Kingston might be the \"smartest man in rugby\" after he scored 104 out of 100 in his 2009 ATAR ranking – receiving a ranking of 99 based on his HSC marks, with five bonus additional points awarded due to his national representative achievements in rugby."

It was situated in the south-east corner of the Olympic Park, alongside the Aquatics Centre, and opposite the Olympic Stadium on the opposite bank of the Waterworks River.\nThe Aquatics Centre and Water Polo Arena were adjacent to each other in one of the most compact areas of the park. To make the best use of the space available, some back-of-house facilities, such as space for broadcasters, catering and security, were shared between the two venues.\nConstruction.\nConstruction on the temporary structure began in spring 2011. During the Olympics, the 5,000-seat arena hosted both the men's and women's water-polo competitions, and contained both a warm-up pool and a competition pool.\nThe first dedicated water-polo venue to be built for an Olympics, the structure was taken down after the games. Elements of the venue were expected to be reused or relocated elsewhere. Parts of the roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues of the building were to be recycled via Vinyloop. This allowed the organizers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority, concerning environmental protection. Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was to be fulfilled, which stated that\nLondon 2012 were the first Olympic Games whose guidelines included the recycling of PVC. Recycled cushions, which form part of the rippling PVC roof, were used to create the striking looking venue, as well as to improve insulation and prevent condensation."

        "text": "The 1080 is a skateboarding trick that can be performed on a vertical skateboard ramp or on a mega ramp, in which the skateboarder makes three full revolutions (1080 degrees of rotation in total, hence the name) while airborne. It was first completed successfully on a mega ramp in 2012 by American skateboarder Tom Schaar, and on a vert ramp in May 2020 by Brazilian skateboarder Gui Khury. The 1080 has only ever been landed after a fakie ollie, meaning the rider is in the normal stance, but rolling in the opposite direction, popping off of the tail. \nMega ramp (big air).\nThe first-ever 1080 was landed by American skateboarder Tom Schaar on March 26, 2012, at the age of 12. Schaar completed the stunt on a mega ramp at Woodward West in Tehachapi, California, on his fifth attempt. The jump was filmed by several cameras at the MegaRamp at Woodward West. A roll-over feature was custom-built which allowed the skater to drop in on the 70-foot-tall and roll right over a 50-foot gap in the ramp, thus allowing Schaar to keep momentum going all the way through to the quarter pipe. Schaar performed several 720s and a 900 while warming-up. He then attempted to perform the 1080, failing four times before successfully landing his fifth attempt, being propelled 15 feet above the top of the ramp.\nRed Bull described the 1080 as \"the Holy Grail of all skateboard tricks.\" Schaar has since repeated the feat, and completed a 1080 in competition while participating in the 2012 X Games Asia on April 30, 2012. He won the gold medal in the Skateboard Mini MegaRamp category, the youngest person ever to have done so. At The Dew Tour Ocean City Tom landed the 1080 in Skate Mega 2.0 which resulted in him coming first.\nVert ramp (regular half pipe).\nIn May 2020, at the age of 11, Brazilian skateboarder Gui Khury became the first person to land a 1080 using only a vert ramp, breaking the previous record for a 900 on a vert ramp set by Tony Hawk in 1999. (Khury had previously become the youngest person to land a 900, which he achieved at age 8.) His father credited the COVID-19 pandemic with providing his son the opportunity to practice the technique.\nAt the 2021 X Games, 12 year old Khury successfully landed a 1080 on the vertical ramp, making him the youngest gold medal winner in X Games history."

The vehicle originally had been stopped for following too closely in Banks County, Georgia on Interstate 85 northeast of Atlanta; the vehicle failed to yield for about two miles, with speeds reaching 98 mph, before it finally pulled over. Scott was facing a possible 25-year prison sentence for his drug charges. On May 2, 2017, a Georgia superior court issued a ruling to suppress all evidence and dismiss the felony drug case against Scott and his brother, largely based upon testimony and evidence that suggested a pattern of racial profiling by law enforcement in the county."

        "title": "New Zealand women's national rugby sevens team",
        "text": "The New Zealand women's national rugby sevens team represents New Zealand in the World Rugby Sevens Series, Rugby World Cup Sevens, Summer Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games.\nThe team played for the first time at the 1997 Hong Kong Womens Sevens.\nThey have won 2 World Cups, 7 Womens Rugby Sevens Series, 4 Oceania Women's Sevens Series Championships, 1 Summer Olympic Games competition and 1 Commonwealth Games tournament.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nThe \"New Zealand Wild Ducks\", an unofficial women's sevens team, represented New Zealand in the early years of women's rugby sevens. Composed of players such as Anna Richards, Monique Hirovaana, Dianne Apiti (later Kahura), Suzy Shortland, Louisa Wall, Tasha Williams, Annaleah Rush, Mata Young, Sharleen Holden and Ria Ataera, they competed in the inaugural 1997 tournament and emerged victorious. Richards was named Player of the Tournament. Despite not being officially recognised as a national side by the New Zealand Rugby Union at the time, seven players from the \"Wild Ducks\" (Hirovaana, Kahura, Richards, Rush, Shortland, Wall and Williams) also represented New Zealand at the 1998 Women's Rugby World Cup, where they clinched the World Championship title under the guidance of coach Darryl Suasua. The team won the second tournament in 1999.\nThe first official New Zealand women’s sevens team was selected in 2000 and was coached by Darryl Suasua. They won the 2000 Hong Kong Sevens after defeating Australia 36–10 in the final. the team consisted of Lavinia Gould, Sherry Hansen, Dianne Kahura, Noi Kurei, Sharleen Nathan (nee Holden),Hannah Porter (nee Myers), Anna Richards, Annaleah Rush, Suzy Shortland and Tammi Wilson. They returned the next year to win the 2001 tournament by defeating the United States team 22–10 in the final.\nAotearoa Māori.\nThe New Zealand Rugby Football Union then decided to not fund any subsequent official attendance. Wishing to keep New Zealand involved in the tournament and thus keep up its profile the USA Sevens coach Emil Signes who was one of the tournament organisers approached Bay of Plenty coach Peter Joseph who had been coaching the Aotearoa Māori sevens team since its formation in 2000. Signes asked him to try to bring a team to the event. Joseph agreed to do so. As they were not endorsed by the New Zealand Rugby Union they were unable to receive any funding from charitable trusts. As Joseph and his wife Shelly were considering moving they sold their house and via a mortgage on their new Rotorua home provided NZ$64,000 to fund the team.\nConsisting up of just Māori players this unofficial New Zealand team won the 2002 tournament, defeating the USA in the final. They were told that they wouldn’t be allowed to return to complete in the 2003 event as members of the team were selected on race and instead the Wild Ducks would be invited. Joseph protested and the team was allowed back, this time with the very blonde haired Stephanie Mortimer in the team, which put an end to the complaint. They won the 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and the 2007 events. Embarrassed by their success the organisers decreed that only “full national” teams and excluded from the tournament from the 2008 and 2009 events. In 2010 they received a late invitation to attend that years tournament, losing in the semi-final to the eventual tournament winners, the Aussie Amazons. Prior to the 2006 event the organisers obtained to 15 year old Sharn Waru playing in what they claimed was an over 18 year old event. Despite it being pointed out that a 17 year old was playing for China and Waru having a clearance to play from the New Zealand Rugby Foot Union it wasn’t until a letter was produced from her uncle Tana Umaga that she was allowed to play. She went on to score the winning try in the final. At one point when the Māori Party was in a coalition government with the National Party the team received a grant of $25,000. In May 2008 they played in the first ever women’s seven match held at Twickenham, losing 14-10 to England.\nAotearoa Māori also won the Roma International Rugby Sevens Tournament in 2010, 2011 and 2012. In the final of the 2012 event they defeated a Russian team, 24-21. Between 2002 and 2007 they won 33 games in a row. Between 2000 and 2012 the team won 14 of the 18 official tournaments that they had entered. Of the 81 women who served with Aotearoa Māori over its life 34 were to go on to serve either in the Black Ferns or Black Ferns Sevens. Among the nine who were to go on to serve in the Black Ferns Sevens were Honey Hireme, Sarah Hirini (née Goss) and Selica Winiata.\nKUSA.\nAmong those who served in the team at the 2002 Hong Kong Sevens events was Mere Baker, who by 2009, due to injury and her age was no longer being selected by Aotearoa Māori. To provide them with competition Baker with the support of Ernie Goodhue helped establish the KUSA (Kiwi/USA) Superclub Sevens. Initially most of its players were sourced from those who had missed out on selection for Aotearoa Māori, plus others from Canterbury and the USA. Coached by Baker and Goodhue among those who played for the team were Black Ferns such as Zoey Berry, Kelly Brazier, Olivia Coady, Lavinia Gould, Halie Hurring, Kendra Cocksedge, Amiria Rule, Anika Tiplady and newcomers such as Ruby Tui. The KUSA were beaten in the final of the 2011 Roma International Rugby Sevens Tournament in June 2011 by Aotearoa Māori. The KUSA went on to win the Byron Bay tournament held in October 2011 and a development side (featuring a young Ruby Tui) completed in a Gold Coast tournament in November 2011, losing in the quarter finals to Tonga. As they had no official backing the team had to fund raise to play in tournaments with for example participation in the Gold Coast tournament requiring each member of the team to contribute approximately NZ$3,000, either out of their own pocket or though fundraising.\nKUSA ceased to exist after the New Zealand Rugby commenced funding the Black Ferns to compete in the World Series in 2012.\nFirst World Cup.\nIn July 2008 Darryl Suasua was appointed coach of a officially sanctioned New Zealand women's sevens side to compete in the inaugural Women’s Rugby Sevens World Cup which was to held in Dubai in 2009. As a part of the New Zealand's preparations a squad of 29 players assemble in Auckland on 12 July for a three-day trial camp, which would be reduced to 12 to compete in the qualifying tournament in Samoa, on 25–26 July. Selected for the trial squad were: Billy Jean Ale, Fa'anati Aniseko, Victoria Blackledge, Kelly Brazier, Kendra Cocksedge, Exia Edwards, Julie Ferguson, Honey Hireme, Carla Hohepa, Linda Itunu, Jennifer James, Justine Lavea, Vaniya Lavea, Stacey Lene, Huriana Manuel, Angela McGregor, Hannah Porter, Amiria Rule, Melissa Ruscoe, Aroha Savage, Aimee Sutorius, Karley Te Kawa, Teresa Te Tamaki, Ngahuri Thompson, Mallory Townsend, Hazel Tubic, Shaan Waru, Renee Wickliffe and Selica Winiata.\nSixteen teams turned up in Dubai to compete in the World Cup, with New Zealand losing in the final to Australia 15-10.\nGo for Gold.\nIn October 2009 the International Olympic Committee agreed by 81 to 8 votes to include Rugby sevens in the Rio Olympics.\nAware that it was important to New Zealand's reputation that they field a competitive team, the decision was made by New Zealand Rugby to establish a high performance woman's sevens squad.\nTony Philp who was responsible for New Zealand Rugby's men’s sevens was allocated NZ$50,000 and assigned the task. Soon after Sean Horan was appointed fulltime coach with support to be provided by the regional sevens resource coaches. The decision was soon made to have the country's 14 national provincial unions host open trials targeted at woman between the ages of 16 and 24 irrespective of whether they had any prior rugby experience. \nThe programme was called \"Go for Gold\" and used the tag \"Got what it takes to Go for Gold\" in advertising targeted at young woman. Philip was of the opinion that compared with other countries most New Zealand woman even if they had never played the game would have seen a game and thus had an innate understanding of the game and its terminology.\nAllan Bunting who had played men's sevens and had started coaching was recruited in 2012 to assist Philp and Horan. In addition to radio, television and print advertising the trio used their contacts to assist with talent spotting. One thousand online applicants were received of whom 800 attended the trials where they were put through various fitness, rugby skills and character assessment activities. Michaela Blyde was made to attend a trial by her mother Cherry who was a former Black Fern. Blyde was heavily involved in playing soccer at the time and was upset when attendance at a second trial meant missing out on a soccer tournament. A naturally talented sportswoman Gayle Broughton had a troubled childhood, which had led to her being expelled at the age of 16 from high school. Her grandmother promised to give her $10 if she would attend a trial. This was enough to tempt her to meet her grandmother the morning after a party and be driven by her to what she thought would be a \"dumb trial\".\nThe 60 most promising then attended a camp at Waiouru in mid-2012. This group was further reduced to 30, who then attended a second training camp at Waiouru. Among those selected were Shakira Baker, Blyde, Broughton, as well as Huriana Manuel, Carla Hohepa, Linda Itunu, and Hazel Tubic who had already represented their country in test rugby while Sarah Hirini had played with Aotearoa Maori, Ruby Tui and Tyla Nathan-Wong who were playing club rugby. Also at Waiouru were semi-professional netballers Kayla McAlister and Portia Woodman, who without telling their coach had enrolled in the Go for Gold program.\nAfter volunteering at various activities Stu Ross joined the coaching team as an analyst. Emphasis now began on improving the squad members skill level, fitness and nutrition. Training of commenced at provincial academes with squad members only paid when the entire squad assembled.\nFirst Competition.\nThe first official Sevens team to see action since the announcement that it would be an Olympic sport was the team which participated in the 2012 Oceania Women's Sevens Championship. The team of 12 (which included among others, Kendra Cocksedge, Hirini, Iruna, Manuel, Nathan-Wong, Tui and Woodman) won the tournament. Winning this event gained New Zealand entry to the 2013 World Cup in Moscow, Russia, which they won.\nFollowing the teams return to New Zealand canoeist Lisa Carrington visited one of their training camps and bought along her gold medal from London Olympics to inspire them.\nWhile they were not on any salary each team member received a payment of NZ$2,000 per tournament.\n2012-2013 Seven Series Season.\nFollowing the Oceania tournament a squad consisting of Lauren Burgess, Marama Davis, Sarah Hirini, Lavinia Gould, Carla Hohepa, Chyna Hohepa, Linda Itunu, Kayla McAlister, Huriana Manuel, Tyla Nathan Wong, Amanda Rasch and Portia Woodman was selected to complete in the inaugural 2012–13 IRB Women's Sevens World Series.\nCaptained by Manuel the team won the series following a fourth at Houston and wins at Guangzhou and Amsterdam having scored 169 points and conceded 34.\nBecause of their potential to win gold at the Olympics, High Performance Sport New Zealand in 2013 provided funding of $800,000 which was increased to $900,000 in 2014.\n2013-2014 Seven Series Season.\nThe 2013-2014 season commenced with a loss to Australia in the final of the Dubai Sevens, a win in Atlanta, followed by a runner up in Sao Paolo before the squad won the next six tournaments to win that year’s title.\nBy 2014 the squad still under the overall direction of head coach Sean Horan had consolidated around two hubs, one at Auckland under Allan Bunting and the other at Mount Maunganui under Cory Sweeney. A few players were located in the Waikato.\n2014-2015 Seven Series Season.\nFor the 2014-2015 season the players were awarded contracts with at least four “tier one” players getting NZ$30,000 for, at least four “tier two” players getting NZ$25,000 and the remaining contracted players NZ$15,000 to NZ$20,000. Despite this most of the players still had to take paid jobs and were having balance that along with training, overseas travel and often family commitments.\nThe 2014-15 season commenced with four wins in a row, at Dubai, Sao Paulo, Atlanta and Langford in Canada before at London they suffered a shock loss to Spain in pool play and they eventually finished fourth. At Amsterdam they lost to the USA team in group play and then lost their quarter final game with England. Their early wins however allowed them to retain the series title and with it gain automatic qualification to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nAfter Huriana Manuel suffered a serious ankle injury at the 2014 Fifteens World Cup, which ruled her out of playing for the Sevens team she was replaced as captain by Sarah Hirini.\n2015-2016 Seven Series Season.\nIn 2015 the team attended an intensive physical training camp in high temperatures and humidity in Fiji. This was followed by an even more intensive winter camp in Waiouru designed to push them to their physical limits and overseen by the army. With 5am starts, tasks included trying to erect a army canvas tent in a deep cold pool, having to push army trucks for kilometres and in one remote dissolute location having to dig a hole with their entrenching tool which they then had to sleep overnight. To her horror Carla Hohepa dug into the nest of a large spider.\nFor the 2015-2016 season the players with the assistance of the New Zealand Rugby Players Association were able to get their contracts raised, with NZ$40,000 on offer for the senior players.\nBy the start of the 2015-16 season other teams were starting to catch up the team. This coupled with the hub system reducing their off-field connection, conflicts over the style of play between Horan and the players unsettled the team and their performances became inconsistent. The season commenced with a loss to Russia in pool play at Dubai and a loss to Australia in the quarter-final, Manuel returned in 2016. They were third at Sao Paulo, then runners up at Atlanta and Langford, Australia and England respectively. They were third at Clermont-Ferrand, with Australia winning the season title. New Zealand was runner up despite not winning a single tournament.\nIn January 2016 a squad of 22 was announced, consisting of Shakira Baker, Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Sarah Hirini, Honey Hireme, Carla Hohepa, Lesley Ketu, Huriana Manuel, Kayla McAlister, Tyla Nathan-Wong, Shiray Kaka (nee Tane), Terina Te Tamaki, Hazel Tubic, Ruby Tui, Janna Vaughan, Stacey Waaka (later Fluher), Jordon Webber, Kat Whata-Simpkins, Niall Williams, Selica Winiata and Portia Woodman.\nFrom this squad, it was intended that 12 players will be selected for the New Zealand sevens team to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games.\n2016 Rio Olympic Games.\nThe New Zealand Women’s Rugby Sevens team for the Rio Olympics was: Shakira Baker, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Sarah Hirini (captain), Kayla McAlister, Huriana Manuel, Tyla Nathan-Wong, Terina Te Tamaki, Ruby Tui, Niall Williams, Portia Woodman with the travelling reserves being Michaela Blyde and Shiray Tane.\nPrior to the commencement of the games in order to assist the players in adjusting to the heat of Brazil they had a training camp in Tampa, Florida.\nAt the Rio Olympics the team scored 109 points and conceded 12 in pool play before beating the USA in the quarter-finals, Great Britain in the semi-finals, but lost 24-17 to Australia in the final. The loss hit the squad hard. Among the members of the team were Shakira Baker, Gayle Broughton, Woodman, Sarah Hirini, Niall Williams, Manuel, Nathan-Wong and Michaela Blyde (who was a travelling reserve).\nBroughton ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) at the Sao Paulo tournament in February 2016 and after opting for a non-surgical treatment played at Rio without ligaments in the effected knee.\nFollowing Rio Sean Horan resigned as coach.\nAllan Bunting and Cory Sweeney both applied for the head coaching position, agreeing that regardless of who got the job, the other would serve as others assistant. In early November 2016 Bunting was appointed as the new head coach with Sweeney as his assistant, while Stu Ross accepted the position of analyst and set-piece coach.\nThere were changes among the players with Huriana Manuel retiring and Kayla McAlister taking a year away from the game in order to have a child.\nBunting and Sweeney decided to play games using a player lead approach that used space and relentless attack, even from while on defense, a style that they came to term \"Kokirikiri\". Hirini remained captain and to support her the coaches encouraged other senior players to take on various roles. Once the coaches had set the overall approach for a game Kelly Brazier and Tyla Nathan-Wong would led general performance preparation and direct on field set plays, especially on attack. They also took on Tui and Williams lead the team off field culture and in defense on field. Fluhler and Woodman took responsibility for the squad's Māori culture.\nAs the team culture developed Māori culture and language began to become more and more integrated into the team. With half the team of Samoan descent, there is a strong Samoan influence as well. Fluhler created a team song by writing lyrics to \"Te KapaRapango Takiwhitu\" in English which her cousin translated into Māori.\n2016-2017 Seven Series Season.\nThe first chance to try the new approach was at Dubai in December 2016 which gave the chance to debut the teenage Tenika Williams and give fringe players Rebekah Tufuga-Corden, Katarina Whata-Simpkins and Jordan Webber a run. With no losses they won their first tournament in more than a year despite being reduced by injuries having only 10 players available for the final. Dubai was the last tournament at which a team member was used to bring water to the on field players after it was observed that the exuberant \"chatter\" from an injured Niall Williams who was on water-duty ran the risk of giving away too much information to their Australian rivals.\nFollowing on from the success of the 2012 \"Go For Gold\" talent identification programme, New Zealand Rugby held 18 trials in February 2017 throughout New Zealand to identify potential athletes for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nIn January 2017 a squad of 20 was selected, with 18 on full contracts and two on training contracts. With Kayla McAlister pregnant and Huriana Manuel having retired the squad consisted of Sarah Hirini (captain), Shakira Baker, Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Rebekah Cordero-Tufuga, Lyric Faleafaga (training contract), Theresa Fitzpatrick, Crystal Mayes (training contract), Tyla Nathan-Wong, Cheyelle Robins-Reti, Alena Saili, Terina Te Tamaki, Ruby Tui, Stacey Fluher, Katarina Whata-Simpkins, Renee Wickliffe, Niall Williams, Tenika Willison and Portia Woodman.\nThe latter half of the season was disrupted when a number of players including Kelly Brazier, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Sarah Hirini and Portia Woodman were recruited for the Black Ferns fifteen-a-side team to compete in that teams ultimately successful 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup campaign in August of that year. Despite the loss of some of their best-known players the rest of the Sevens team won in Canada in May, then in France in June and thus ensured that the team won the World Series with 118 points compared to the next closest team which was Australia with 108 points.\n2017-2018 Seven Series Season.\nThe 2017–18 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series didn’t get off to the best start when at Dubai New Zealand was beaten 14-12 by the USA in the quarter-finals, despite having beaten them 45-14 in pool play. This was Kayla McAlister's first tournament after returning from maternity leave. \nIn the final of the Sydney Sevens in January 2018 the Black Ferns Sevens were well beaten 31-nil by Australia. This was the last tournament prior to the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in three months time. After a detailed analysis of what had gone wrong the squad began a fitness training regime designed to allow them to play for a third half.\nIn early 2018 the following 23 players were awarded contracts covering the next 12 months, Shakira Baker, Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Lyric Faleafaga (who graduated from a training to a full contract), Rhiarna Ferris (who was new to the squad), Theresa Fitzpatrick, Stacey Fluher, Sarah Hirani, Huia Harding (who was new to the squad), Jazmin Hotham (training contract), Shiray Kaka, Natahlia Moors (training contract), Tyla Nathan-Wong, Risi Pouri-Lane (who was new to the squad), Leanna Ryan (training contract), Alena Saili, Terina Te Tamaki, Ruby Tui, Kat Whata-Simpkins, Niall Williams, Tenika Willison and Portia Woodman.\nIn 2018 it was decided to centralise as much of the men’s and women’s Sevens program at a single location, taking into consideration a climate that allowed maximising of training time, availability of affordable housing and a facility with a playing field that provided office space, meeting rooms a gymnasium and a recovery area. The University of Waikato Adams Centre for High Performance at Mount Maunganui was selected as the best option and the two teams officially moved in on 1 October 2018.\n2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.\nJust prior to departure for their pre-camp on the Sunshine Coast Kat Whata-Simpkins suffered a hamstring injury, which resulted first in 18 year old Risi Pouri-Lane being added to the travelling team and when it was confirmed that Kat would not recover in time Tenika Willison was promoted to the initial 12. Alena Saili was made a travelling reserve or 13th player with Pouri-Lane staying on as another reserve\nRuby Tui then caught mumps, whose highly contagious nature meant that the whole team had to go into isolation at their Brisbane accommodation.\nThe competition at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games held in April 2018 was shorter than normal as there were only eight teams organized into two pools, with the top two teams going forward from each pool.\nIn the warm-up to the final Broughton's knee accidentally hit Blyde, just above her eye which caused blood to flow from her eyebrow. Within minutes Tyla Nathan-Wong had to be sent to hospital after her neck was injured after accidentally collided with Stacey Fluhler's backside. Willison was promoted to the starting lineup as halfback and Pouri-Lane was promoted to the playing 12. These issues delayed the start of the game by five minutes\nIn the final Kelly Brazier scored a runaway 80 metres try in extra time that won the game for New Zealand, while leaving her totally exhausted on the ground.\nFollowing the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games the team returned to the uncompleted 2017-2018 sevens season, winning all three of the remaining tournaments. This was however insufficient to overcome the losses at Dubai and Sydney. As a result Australia won the overall series title. Portia Woodman was both the season's leading try and points scorers, followed by Michael Blyde in both categories. \n2018 World Cup.\nIn July 2018 the team won the 2018 Women's Rugby Sevens World Cup in San Francisco to become women's champion. Rugby World Cup Sevens. Michaela Blyde scored the most tries (nine) and the most points in the competition. In the final Blyde scored three tries as New Zealand beat France 29-0. \nThe team won the Team of the Year award for 2018 at the Halberg Awards.\n2018-2019 Seven Series Season.\nNew Zealand commenced the 2018–19 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series season with tournament wins at Glendale in Colorado, Dubai and Sydney ended their 37 game winning streak with a 17-all draw to Russia in pool play at Kitakyusha, then in pool play they suffered their first ever a loss to France, before being beaten in the quarter-final by USA to finish fifth. The team had commenced the tournament with their coach Bunting on personal leave, Woodman out since October 2018 with a long term Achilles tendon injury, while the central experienced core of the team was decimated by Fitzpatrick, Blyde, Brazier and Broughton not being available, further compounded by Fluhler becoming injured partway through the tournament.\nThe team rebounded to win the tournament in Canada, before at Biarratz being beaten in the final of the season's last tournament. However they still had accumulated enough points to win the series, while Sarah Hirini became the first woman to play in 200 World Series games.\n2019-2020 Seven Series Season.\nThe 2019-2020 season began with a third place at Glendale, before tournament wins at Dubai, Cape Town, Hamilton and Sydney, losing only two games across all five of these tournaments. With Woodman still out of commission Fluhler filled her shoes to become the series dominant try scorer. \nShakira Baker ruptured her ACL in the final at Dubai in December. She was not able to recover in time to be considered for Tokyo.\nIn January 2019 the following 21 players were awarded contracts, Shakira Baker, Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Rhiarna Ferris, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Huia Harding, Sarah Hirini, Jazmin Hotham, Tyla Nathan-Wong, Mahina Paul, Risi Pouri-Lane, Alena Saili Southland, Montessa Tairakena, Terina Te Tamaki, Ruby Tui, Stacey Fluher, Kat Whata-Simpkins, Niall Williams, Tenika Willison and Portia Woodman. Previously involved in the Youth Olympic Games and having completed their high school education Jazmin Hotham, Montessa Tairakena and Mahina Paul were able to promoted to full time contracts.\nThe onset of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the remainder of the season being cancelled. As New Zealand was leading the competition with 783 points scored they were awarded the 2020 series title.\nCovid.\nDue to the international Sevens competition being put on hold the support personnel at the performance base at Mount Manganui was reduced in number with some remaining but on reduced hours. The players had their salaries reduced. The remaining men and women players were organized into a single combined training group in order to form a nucleus of sevens squad overseen by Sweeney, men's coach Clark Laidlaw and men's strength and conditioning coach Blair Mills. Allan Bunting, who had previous been commuting from Auckland stayed in there.\nThe combining of the two teams had the benefit of exposing the respective sexes to different ways of doing things.\nAfter the initial lockdown life within New Zealand returned to a relative normal in late 2020 as the squad reformed and ways were found to prepare for the Tokyo games were had been rescheduled for 2021. Among them were games against a Moana Pasifika team and a team sourced from members of the Black Ferns fifteens in a mini tournament in Wellington which was termed Pure Sevens.\nThe opening of the trans-Tasman bubble in May 2021 allowed the playing of six games against Australia at the Orākei Domain in Auckland which was organized to provide two games per day. The Black Sevens won the series 5-1 with Woodman back in top form.\nIn an effort to replicate playing against team like the USA which had size and speed the team in the first half of 2021 played the Hamilton Boys High School. This school had won the Condor Sevens national school competition sevens times in a row. While rucks were contested it not being a full tackle game, but this didn't prevent Alena Saili fracturing one of her shoulders.\nThe squad participated in the 2021 Oceania Women's Sevens Championship in Townsville against Australia, Fiji and the Oceania Barbarians. New Zealand won the tournament. This was the final playing chance for players to gain selection before the team would be trimmed to 16 for Tokyo. Kelly Brazier attended the tournament but was unable to play due to flu. She then had a hamstring injury, which put her in doubt for Tokyo. While she wasn’t back to 100% by the end of the tournament she was selected.\n2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.\nThe New Zealand Women’s Rugby Sevens team for the Tokyo Olympics was: Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Gayle Broughton, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Stacey Fluhler, Sarah Hirini (captain), Shiray Kaka, Tyla Nathan-Wong, Risaleaana Pouri-Lane, Alena Saili, Ruby Tui and Portia Woodman. The travelling reserves were Jazmin Hotham, Terina Te Tamaki and Tenika Willison (who was the designated 13th team member), while the non-travelling reserves were Shakira Baker, Dhys Faleafaga, Manaia Nuku, Mahina Paul and Cheyelle Robins-Reti. Michaela Blyde and Shiray Kaka had both been reserves at Rio.\nNormally while all 13 members of a team travel to a tournament only members of the final named 12 are allowed to play, but because of Covid the rules at Tokyo allowed any of the officially named 13 to play, with all of them receiving a medal if the team won one. Willison ended up playing in the game against Great Britain and Russia, in place of Brazier and Blyde, respectively.\nSarah Hirini was selected to join Hamish Bond in being New Zealand's flagbearers at the opening ceremony in Tokyo. Due to a racing the next day Bond was replaced by David Nyika.\nDue to Covid restrictions on how many could enter the Olympic Village at a time eleven of the players and management including Hirini were due to fly from Townsville in order to ensure Hirini would be able to attend the opening ceremony. They would be joined later by the rest of the team.\nAfter their first flight was cancelled the eleven missed their connection in Brisbane, which led to their 24-hour pre-departure tests expiring. Eventually a way was found of getting Hirani accompanied by Woodman to Tokyo in time to participate in the opening ceremony.\nNew Zealand beat Kenya. In the next pool game Great Britain raced to a 21-nil lead before being beaten 26-21. They then beat Russia 33-0 and then beat them again in the quarter-final 36-0.\nIn the semi-final the Black Ferns were faced by an much improved Fiji, who up until that time had never beaten New Zealand. Within 90 seconds Broughton scored for New Zealand to give a 5- nil lead. Fiji answered with a try by Vasiti Solikoviti to lead 7-5 at half-time. Resumption of the game after half-time saw Solikoviti score another try to increase the lead to 12-5. Nathan-Wong then equalized with a try under the goal posts. Fluhler scored what was an unconverted try before Fiji scored in the corner to equalize, but Viniana Riwai was unable to convert the try. With the score drawn at 17-all the game was forced into extra time, during which Broughton who had been bought back onto the field to replace Brazier scored the winning try. The final score in favour of the Black Ferns was 22-17.\nThe team then beat France in the final 26-12 after leading 19-5 at halftime.\n2021–22 Sevens Series Season.\nNew Zealand’s participation in the 2021-22 season was disrupted by the team missing the first four tournaments due to travel logistics and travel-related restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe team returned the season with Cory Sweeney continuing as head coach, Stu Ross and Ed Cocker as assistant coaches and Crystal Kaua as skills coach/performance analyst.\nThe absence of New Zealand for two-thirds of the season allowed \nAustralia to dominate, winning four of the six tournament and thus the season title. New Zealand won only the last tournament of the season.\nIn June 2022 New Zealand hosted and won the 2022 Pacific Four Series.\n2022 Birmingham Commonwealth Games.\nIn June 2022 the team was announced to represent New Zealand in the rugby sevens tournament at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. It consisted of Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Theresa Fitzpatrick, Sarah Hirini [captain], Stacey Fluhler, Jazmin Hotham, Shiray Kaka, Tyla Nathan-Wong, Risaleaana Pouri-Lane, Alena Saili, Niall Williams, Tenika Willison and Portia Woodman. The travelling reserves were Terina Te Tamaki and Mahina Paul, while the non-travelling reserves were Shakira Baker, Tysha Ikenasio, Manaia Nuku and Ruby Tui. Eleven of the players had been members of the team that had participated in the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.\nPrior to the commencement of the games the team attended a training camp in Scotland.\nAfter topping their pool unbeaten, the team lost their semi-final match against Australia 12-17 and eventually won the bronze medal in the playoff against Canada for third, 19-12.\n2022 World Cup.\nWith Shakira Baker, Tysha Ikenasio and Tyla Nathan-Wong unavailable due to injury the team for the 2022 World Cup held in Cape Town in September 2022 was Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Stacey Fluhler, Sarah Hirini (captain), Jazmin Felix-Hotham, Shiray Kaka, Jorja Miller, Risaleeana Pouri-Lane, Alena Saili, Niall Williams, Tenika Willison and Portia Woodman. The travelling reserves were Manaia Nuku and Mahina Paul. Miller was making her debut for the team. The team lost in the final to arch-rivals Australia, 22-24, which allowed them to add the World Cup to their Commonwealth Games and 2021-22 world series titles and thus claim a rare Triple Crown.\n2022-2023 Seven Series Season.\nInitially the 2022-23 season commenced with New Zealand (despite three tries from Michaela Blyde) losing to Australia in the final in the season opener in Dubai in early December 2022. This loss could have been explained by the absence of Sarah Hirini, Portia Woodman, Stacey Fluhler, Ruby Tui and Theresa Fitzpatrick who were resting after playing for the fifteen-a-side Blacks Ferns team in the World Cup. Under the captaincy of Tyla Nathan-Wong the Dubai tournament witnessed the debuts of Tysha Ikenasio, Kelsey Teneti and Manaia Nuku, with the appearance of Jorja Miller in her first World Series tournament. Other team members were Niall Williams, Michaela Blyde, Kelly Brazier, Jazmin Felix-Hotham, Terina Te Tamaki, Shiray Kaka, Risaleaana Pouri-Lane and Mahina Paul.\nAgain captained by Tylka Nathan-Wong the same team then turned the tables on Australia by beating them in the final of the next tournament at Cape Town. Up until this point Australia had dominated Sevens in 2022, winning the Commonwealth Games, World Cup and the Dubai tournament.\nThe third tournament in the series, was held in Hamilton, New Zealand with all of the Black Ferns world cup secondments (with the exception of Ruby Tui) available to booster the team’s firepower in front of family and New Zealand supporters. The team won at Hamilton and all of the remaining tournaments in the series to make six tournament wins out of seven, having won 36 consecutive matches. Michael Blyde was the series second highest try scorer with 43, Stacey Fluhler fourth equal with 30 and Portia Woodman eighth equal with 24. Tyla Nathan-Wong was the second highest points scorer and Michaela Blyde the third highest.\nAt the 2023 World Rugby Sevens Series Awards, Jorja Miller was named rookie of the year, while Blyde, Fluhler, Hirini and Nathan-Wong were named as members of the 2023 women's dream team.\nIn recognition of them being crowned the 2022-2023 Sevens champions the team won the team of the year award at New Zealand's 2023 Halberg Awards. \n2023 Oceania Sevens Championship.\nAs they had already qualified for the 2024 Tokyo Olympics New Zealand elected to send a development team (made up of a mix of contracted and development players) to the 2023 Oceania Women's Sevens Championship held in Queensland from 10 to 12 November 2023. The team consisted of: Reese Anderson, Dhys Faleafaga, Theresa Fitzpatrick (co-captain), Tysha Ikenasio, Shiray Kaka, Jorja Miller, Manaia Nuku, Grace Steinmetz, Kelsey Teneti, Terina Te Tamaki, Olive Watherston, Tenika Willison (co-captain).\nTo allow other teams from Oceania to qualify for Tokyo New Zealand and Australia (who had already qualified) played each other in a dedicated pool.

Each team at the event played two games, New Zealand beating Brazil 41-0 and then in the final, France 24-12.\nInitially the Dubai tournament didn’t start well with captain Sarah Hirini having to score a late try in their first game to create a 19-14 winning margin and thus prevent a upset defeat to South Africa.

Despite her loss the team went on defeat Fiji 29-21 in the last game of pool play before beating Brazil 26-14 in the quarterfinal and then Canada in the semifinal.\nIn the final despite three tries from Jorja Miller, New Zealand was beaten 26-19 by their arch rivals Australia.

        "title": "UCLA Bruins men's basketball retired numbers",
        "text": "The men's college basketball program of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) was founded in 1920 and is known competitively as the UCLA Bruins. The Bruins have won 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I national championships, the most of any school. UCLA players have been assigned jersey numbers ranging from 0 to 78 in the team's history. The school no longer issues nine retired numbers in honor of 10 former players. To qualify, a player must have been a three-time consensus All-American, a consensus national player of the year, or been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The retired numbers are displayed in the rafters of the Bruins' home arena, Pauley Pavilion. UCLA's legendary coach John Wooden generally opposed having numbers retired.\nHistory.\nNumbers retired by UCLA were originally limited to three-time consensus All-Americans. In 1990, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his UCLA career, and Bill Walton were the first to have their numbers retired. The ceremony was held in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of Pauley Pavilion. Wooden valued team play over individual accolades, and he opposed retiring numbers. \"What about the fellows who wore that number before?\" Wooden asked. \"Didn't they contribute to the team?\" Wooden did think highly of Abdul-Jabbar and Walton. \"If such a thing can be deserved, it'd be Alcindor and Walton. But I don't think it would be anyone else,\" said Wooden.\nUCLA in 1996 expanded the requirements for retiring numbers to include players who were consensus national players of the year. This allowed the jersey numbers of Walt Hazzard ( 42), Sidney Wicks (35), Marques Johnson (54), and Ed O'Bannon (31) to be retired. In 2004, UCLA also allowed players inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame to be eligible, enabling the retirement of Gail Goodrich's No. 25. Three Bruins were inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012, and UCLA retired their numbers in 2013—Jamaal Wilkes (52), Reggie Miller (31), and Don Barksdale (11). It was the second time No. 31 was retired, O'Bannon's being the first.\nEight of the players honored were members of NCAA championship teams, and seven of the players were coached by Wooden. Although Hazzard's No. 42 was retired, he allowed Kevin Love (2007–2008) to wear it. Johnson's retired No. 54 was worn by his sons, Kris (1994–1998) and Josiah (2001–2005).\nIn 2014, UCLA announced that No. 42 would be retired across all the university's sports in honor of Jackie Robinson, a four-sport star at UCLA who went on to a Hall of Fame career in Major League Baseball after breaking the baseball color line. While Robinson wore several different numbers while at the school from 1939 to 1941, UCLA chose to honor the iconic No. 42 that he wore during his career with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The announcement had no impact on the men's basketball program, since the number was already retired for Hazzard, who had requested No. 42 as his college number to follow in the footsteps of Robinson, his childhood idol. Robinson also played basketball for the Bruins, but he wore No. 18."

It would be his only title on the Grand Prix tennis circuit. Also that year, in Wimbledon, Felgate won his first Grand Slam doubles match. Felgate and Nick Brown, wild card entrants, upset third seeds Ken Flach and Robert Seguso in the first round, before losing in the second round. He also reached the second round at Wimbledon in 1986, with Shaw, and in 1988, with Nick Fulwood.\nHe made his first Grand Slam singles appearance in 1988. After going through qualifying, Felgate played against Eddie Edwards in the first round of the 1988 Australian Open. He lost heavily to the South African, only winning three games during the match.

        "text": "The 1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate basketball during the 1908–09 season. The team played its home games at Waterman Gymnasium and compiled a record of 1–4. The team won Michigan's first intercollegiate basketball game, and played in its first overtime game, defeating Oberlin College, 27–25, on January 16, 1909. Carl Raiss won the game in overtime with \"a difficult goal from the middle of the field.\" At the end of the season, basketball was discontinued at Michigan for the next eight years. Although the 1908–09 team played only two home games, low attendance and poor conditions at Waterman Gymnasium were cited as the reasons for terminating the basketball program.\nGeorge Corneal, at age 25, served as Michigan's first basketball coach during the 1908–09 season. Corneal had been hired in 1907 as the assistant in physical training at Waterman Gymnasium. He spent only one year at Michigan and later served for 33 years as a football, track, and basketball in Wisconsin. Joseph Wilson was the team captain. Henry H. Farquhar was the team's leading scorer with 48 points (12 field goals and 24 free throws) and average of 9.6 points per game.\nPre-season.\nIn its January 1909 issue, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" announced: \"For the first time in the history of the University there is to be a varsity basketball team. Realizing the demand for an indoor winter sport and the presence of good material in college, the athletic authorities passed a resolution providing for a basketball team and granted them a schedule of seven or eight games for the season.\" The \"Alumnus\" observed that basketball had become \"almost a major sport\" in many leading colleges, and its recognition as a varsity sport at Michigan was \"greeted with approval by students and alumni alike.\"\nHead coach George Corneal had difficulty finding players who were eligible for the team. Stanley Cox was \"easily the best known basketball man\" at Michigan, and he had been recruited by several big eastern colleges. However, Cox was ruled academically ineligible to play.\nGame summaries.\nAt Michigan Agricultural College.\nMichigan's first intercollegiate basketball game was played on Saturday, January 9, 1909, against Michigan Agricultural College at \"the local gym\" in Lansing. The Aggies won the game, 24-16. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" wrote that the loss was due to Michigan's \"inability to locate the basket.\" The Wolverines scored only four goals from the field, one each by H. H. Farquhar, F. C. Wilson, Raiss, and Ely. Farquhar scored ten of Michigan's 16 points on one goal from field and eight goals from foul. Michigan's starting lineup in the opening game was Farquhar (left forward), Wilson (right forward), Raiss (center), Peck (left guard), and Ely (right guard).\nOberlin.\nMichigan won its first intercollegiate basketball game, and played in its first overtime game, on Saturday, January 16, 1909, against Oberlin College. The game was played at the Waterman Gymnasium on the Michigan campus, and Michigan won by a score of 27 to 25. The game was tied at the end of each 20-minute half, and the teams decided to play an extra five minutes. Raiss won the game in overtime with \"a difficult goal from the middle of the field.\" Raiss was Michigan's high scorer with 10 points on five field goals. Lathers added six points on three field goals, and Farquhar had seven points on two field goals and three free throws. Team captain Wilson added four points on two field goals. Michigan's starting lineup against Oberlin was Raiss (right forward), Farquhar (left forward), Lathers (center), Wilson (right guard and captain), and Peck (left guard).\nAt Michigan Agricultural.\nOn February 20, 1909, Michigan played its second road game, traveling to Lansing, Michigan for a rematch against Michigan Agricultural College. The Aggies defeated the Wolverines, 45 to 25. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" noted that the game was \"replete with fouls\" and was \"about the roughest contest imaginable.\" The \"Alumnus\" added that Michigan \"showed a decided lack of teamwork and was much too slow for the speedy Lansing players.\"\nAt Ohio State.\nOn Saturday, February 27, 1909, the team played its first game outside the State of Michigan. The Wolverines traveled to Columbus, Ohio, where they lost to Ohio State, 29 to 22. Michigan trailed by only one point at halftime. Team captain Wilson fouled out of the game after committing five fouls, and he was replaced by Peck. Michigan's leading scorer in the game was West with 12 points on four field goals and four free throws.\nOhio State.\nMichigan concluded its season on March 6, 1909, with a 42-24 loss to Ohio State in Ann Arbor. Michigan had led at halftime by a score of 16 to 14, but Ohio State outscored the Wolverines, 28 to 8, in the second half. \"The Michigan Alumnus\" attributed the poor performance in the second half to \"fast playing by the Buckeyes and the introduction of two substitutes not in the best of condition.\" Farquhar was Michigan's leading scorer with 16 points on four field goals and eight free throws. West and Lathers added four points each (two field goals each), and Wilson had two points on one field goal. Michigan's lineup in the game was Farquhar (left forward), West (right forward), Lathers and Raiss (center), Wilson and Cox (right forward), and Hayes (right guard).\nPost-season.\nAt the end of the 1909 season, the members of the team elected J. Griffith Hayes as the captain of the 1909-10 team. Hayes played guard on the 1909 team and was described by \"The Michigan Alumnus\" as \"a hard worker and a star at the game.\""

The head coach was Tom Izzo who was in his 18th year. The team played their home games at Breslin Center in East Lansing, MI and were members of the Big Ten Conference. MSU finished with a record of 27–9, 13–5 to finish in a tie for second place in Big Ten play. The Spartans lost in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament to Ohio State. MSU received a bid to the NCAA tournament for the 16th straight year where they reached the Sweet Sixteen for the second consecutive year, losing to Duke.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2011–12 season with a record of 29–8, 13–5 to earn a share of the Big Ten Championship. They won the Big Ten tournament to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 15th straight trip to the Tournament, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to Louisville.\nOffeseason.\nThe Spartans lost Draymond Green (16.2 PPG, 10.6 RPG, 3.8 APG) to the NBA draft following the season.\n2012 recruiting class.\nMichigan State's top-10 ranked recruiting class, was headlined by 6'4\" SG Gary Harris. The rest of the class consisted of PF Matt Costello, PF Kenny Kaminski, and PG Denzel Valentine. Notably, Matt Costello and Denzel Valentine finished first and second, respectively, in the voting for Michigan's Mr. Basketball, MSU's fourth straight Mr. Basketball signee (2011 winner Dwaun Anderson originally signed with Michigan State, but was released from his National Letter of Intent to go to Wagner College for personal reasons). \nSeason summary.\nJuniors Adreian Payne (10.5 points and 7.6 rebounds per game) and Keith Appling (13.4 points per game), senior Derrick Nix (9.9 points and 6.6 rebounds per game), and sophomore Branden Dawson (8.9 points and 5.9 rebounds per game) led the Spartans. Freshman Gary Harris (12.9 points per game) also played a major role for the Spartans. The Spartans began the season ranked No. 14 in both polls and traveled to Germany to play Connecticut at Ramstein Air Force Base. The Spartans were stunned by UConn, but rebounded with a win over No. 7 Kansas in the Champions Classic. Shortly thereafter, MSU fell to Miami in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Spartans defeated Tuskegee at Jenison Field House, their former basketball home on Michigan State's campus in a series of games held to commemorate the \"Game of Change\" that occurred during the 1963 NCAA tournament. The Spartans cruised through the remaining non-conference season to finish at 11–2 and ranked No. 18 in the country.\nMichigan State lost their first Big Ten game to No. 9-ranked Minnesota, but won their next six conference games. The streak included a win over No. 11 Ohio State. Following a loss to No. 7 Indiana, MSU again went on a winning streak, winning their next five games including wins against No. 18 Minnesota and No. 4 Michigan. The streak ended with losses to No. 1 Indiana, at No. 18 Ohio State, and at No. 4 Michigan in a three-game stretch leaving MSU at 11–5 in conference. MSU rebounded to win the final two games against No. 22 Wisconsin and Northwestern. The Spartans finished in a second place tie with Ohio State with a 13–5 conference record and ranked No. 8 in the country.\nAs the No. 3 seed in the Big Ten tournament, MSU faced Iowa in the quarterfinals. After a brutal first half where the Spartans only mustered 20 points and trailed Iowa 30–20 at the break, MSU responded. Led by Keith Appling and Gary Harris' 13 points each, MSU rallied from a 12-point deficit in the second half to pull out the 59–56 victory. The win moved MSU to the semifinals of the tournament against Ohio State. In a hard fought battle, MSU was unable to pull out the victory, falling to OSU 61–58.\nThe Spartans received a No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 16th straight appearance in the Tournament. Led by Derrick Nix's 23 points and 15 rebounds in the game, as the Spartans cruised to a 65–54 win over Valparaiso in the first round. In the second round, Gary Harris led the Spartans with 23 points as MSU blew out Memphis to advance to their fifth Sweet Sixteen in six years. The trip to the Sweet Sixteen also marked the Spartans 11th trip in the prior 16 years. However, the Spartans were defeated by No. 2 seed Duke, who was led by Seth Curry with 29 points, in the Sweet Sixteen. Appling's 16 points and Payne's 14 were not enough in the loss.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament"

        "title": "1917–18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 1917–18 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate basketball during the 1917–18 season. The team was Michigan's second varsity basketball team and the first after an eight-year hiatus following the 1908–09 season. With no experienced collegiate players to draw from, the squad started from scratch and compiled a record of 6–12. They finished last in the Big Ten Conference with a record of 0–10 against conference opponents, the only winless conference season in Michigan history.\nElmer Mitchell, a 28-year-old graduate of the University of Michigan, served as the coach. He returned to Michigan in 1917 after having held positions as the athletic director at Grand Rapids Union High School from 1912 to 1915 and at Michigan State Normal College (now known as Eastern Michigan University) from 1915 to 1917. After a difficult start in the 1917–18 season, Mitchell led the team to a 12-game turnaround with a 16–8 record in the 1918–19 season. In 1919, Mitchell established the intramural sports program at Michigan and served as its director.\nAlan W. Boyd was the team captain. James McClintock was the team's leading scorer with 108 points on 43 field goals and 22 free throws in 16 games. Timothy Hewlett led in scoring average with 7.0 points per game (22 field goals and 12 free throws in eight games).\nPre-season.\nIn early December 1917, the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that basketball \"receives its inception as a major league sport at Michigan this year.\" The \"Free Press\" noted that the game had never been played \"on a big scale\" in Ann Arbor, and Coach Mitchell had been unable to find experienced players for the team. As a result, the paper opined that Mitchell \"will have his hands full putting any sort of a team on the floor.\"\nCoach Mitchell was also the coach of Michigan's freshman football team and was unable to turn his attention to the basketball team until football season had ended. With his ties to the football team, Mitchell recruited several football players to try out for the basketball team, including Alan Boyd, Abe Cohn, Tad Wieman, Richard Weske, Oscar Cartright, William Cruse, and Angus Goetz. Boyd became the team captain, and Cohn was a reserve on Mitchell's team. During late November and early December, Mitchell held scrimmages to identify the best players. Searching for players with some level of experience, Mitchell looked to the class and fraternity teams. James McClintock, who had played center on the sophomore class team, stood out in the early practices. So, too, did Ralph Rychener who had played forward on the championship team of the fraternity-boarding house league.\nIn the days leading up to the season opener, Mitchell culled the team to 12 players and put them through strenuous conditioning workouts each night as well as passing and shooting drills.\nRegular season.\nMichigan opened its season on December 15, 1917, with a road game in Cleveland against Case Scientific School. Case had a veteran team that had won the Ohio Conference basketball championship the prior year, and the Wolverines lost the game, 27–25. The Wolverines' performance was hindered by the team's lack of experience, and also by difficulty adjusting to the basketball court in the Case gymnasium, which was much smaller than the court the team had become accustomed to at the Waterman Gymnasium in Ann Arbor. The Wolverines did not play any further games in December.\nIn late December, the \"Detroit Free Press\" noted that three home games set for the first week of January were \"expected to arouse interest in the basketball team, a thing which has been noticeable by its absence ever since the practice season started, over a month ago.\" Coach Mitchell expressed concern that the lack of interest and backing had lowered the spirit of the team.\nOver the holidays, the university renovated the basketball court at Waterman Gymnasium. The court was modified to run lengthwise in order to create a larger playing floor, and backboards were hung from the rafters. The \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that the new court \"will be one of the largest and best in the state when it is finished.\"\nAfter a two-week break over the holidays, Michigan won four consecutive home games against the Camp Custer officers' team that featured several former college stars (44–28), Hope College (31–15), Case (24–20), and Michigan Agricultural College (now known as Michigan State University) (17–13), improving its record to 4–1.\nAfter the first three victories, the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that Michigan's basketball team had begun playing together as a team, had started \"passing with a vengeance\", and was \"improving rapidly in every department of the game and rapidly rounding into a first class organization.\" At the same time, the paper expressed concern over the team's defense and uncertainty as to how the team would hold up against tougher Big Ten opponents.\nMichigan played its first Big Ten Conference basketball game at Waterman Gymnasium on January 18, 1918, against Indiana. The Hoosiers defeated the Wolverines, 21–17. With a respectable showing against Indiana, the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that the team's followers were confident that \"fighting spirit\" would carry the team to a good record. The \"Free Press\" noted that, although the players had been \"shooting and passing wildly\", they had made up for their lack of experience with \"plenty of fight\".\nOver the next eight days, Michigan played four more games against Big Ten opponents and lost each game: Chicago (22-6), Ohio State (39-7), Minnesota (28-13), and Northwestern (21-11).\nAfter the January 26 game against the Northwestern, the team had a two-week, mid-season break. Over the break, Coach Mitchell made several changes in his lineup. He announced that, for the remaining games, he would play Rychener and McClintock at forward, Bartz at center, and Emery and Boyd at the guard positions.\nThe \"Detroit Free Press\" opined in early February that a lack of confidence had caused the players to \"miss many easy shots, gum up passes, and lose their heads at a critical moment.\"\nAfter the break, the team lost to the Great Lakes Jackies to extend the team's losing streak to six games. The losing streak, which began against Indiana on January 18, 1918, and continued through the Great Lakes game on February 11, 1918, was a school record that was not broken for 26 years.\nThe team broke its losing streak with a 42–8 victory over Kalamazoo College on February 13, 1918. Three consecutive losses followed against Minnesota (49–10), Indiana (21–20), and Chicago (22–15). The Wolverines then completed a season sweep of Michigan Agricultural College, winning by a score of 31 to 25 in East Lansing. The Wolverines concluded the season with a 34–27 loss to Ohio State on March 9, 1918.\nCritical assessment of the first season.\n\"The Michigan Alumnus\" summarized the season as follows: \"Although the standing of the Michigan basketball team in the Conference is not a thing to be proud of, there can be few objections to the basketball team that Mitchell was able to turn out in the first year of the sport here. At the beginning of the season there was only one experienced man, Hanish, on hand, and Hanish left before the end of the first semester. Bartz and Rowley, good players, were also forced out of the game, the latter from injuries and the former from poor scholastic work.\"\nThe 1918 \"Michiganensian\" wrote: \"Though failing to win a single Conference game, and suffering defeats in 12 of 18 games played, Michigan's first Varsity basketball team did not have such an unsuccessful season as the records would seem to indicate. The Wolverines started the year without an experienced player on hand and Coach Mitchell was not only forced to build a new team -- he was also obligated to get that team into such condition that it could face the best fives in the Big Ten. . . Though more was hoped of the Michigan five, little more could have been expected. The Wolverines were meeting experienced teams in Conference basketball and the Blue players were forced to learn the fundamentals and fine points at the same time. Mitchell worked hard to get a winning combination, but succeeded mostly in preparing his men for next year.\"\nThe \"Detroit Free Press\" summed up Michigan's first season of varsity basketball with this headline: \"Wolverines' Court Year Not in Vain: Much Has Been Accomplished by Coach Mitchell and His Proteges for First Season.\" The \"Free Press\" emphasized that Coach Mitchell began the season without a single experienced player, noted that the team had \"gained greatly\" in experience and form, and concluded that expectations had been too high among the fans in Ann Arbor:\"At the start of the basketball year there was little hope held out for a Michigan triumph in the indoor game. The campus, not quite understanding the nature of the competition Michigan had to face, hoped for bigger things than lay within the realms of possibility. But, when the situation was once made clear, the students supported the team, despite its losses, and have been quite enthusiastic over its development.\"\nPost-season awards.\nAt the end of the season, six players were awarded varsity \"M\" letters for their participation on the 1917-18 men's basketball team: Alan W. Boyd, John H. Emery, Timothy Y. Hewlitt, James I. McClintock, Ralph O. Rychener, and Edward E. Ruzicka. Two players were given aMA letters: Nicholas B. Bartz and Samuel C. Bornstein. Three players were given \"R\" letters as reserves: Cress, Rowley, and Cohn. In early April 1918, the six players who won \"M's\" met and selected \"Doc\" Emery to serve as captain of the 1918-19 team."

For the 31st consecutive season, the tournament was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City, from March 12–16, 2013. The tournament only featured 14 teams due to Connecticut being given a one-year postseason ban due to APR penalties. This would have been the last year with as many as 16 teams participating in the Big East tournament, but Connecticut was ineligible and West Virginia moved to the Big 12 before the beginning of the season. The conference tournament champion received an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA tournament.\nFollowing a period of turnover in the conference membership, the Big East name, its logos, and its tournament history were assumed by schools of the original Big East that do not sponsor FBS football. The reconfigured Big East continues to hold its tournament at Madison Square Garden. The FBS schools formerly in the Big East play under a new name, the American Athletic Conference; its first conference tournament was played in Memphis, Tennessee and that event has since alternated between Hartford, Connecticut and Orlando, Florida.\nSeeds.\nAll teams except for Connecticut (due to Academic Progress Rate violations) qualified for the tournament; seeds 11–14 played a first-round game, while teams five through ten received byes to the second round.

        "title": "2012–13 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2012–13 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, the 92nd season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers were coached by head coach Josh Pastner, who was assisted by Damon Stoudamire, Jimmy Williams and Aki Collins. Stoudamire and Williams both assisted Pastner in 2011–12, and Collins left Marquette in May 2012 to join Pastner's staff. The Tigers played their home games at the FedExForum in Memphis. The 2012–13 season was the final season the Tigers participated in Conference USA before joining the American Athletic Conference in 2013–14. They finished the season 31–5, 16–0 in C-USA play to be Conference USA regular season champions. They also were champions of the Conference USA tournament, winning the championship game in two overtimes vs Southern Miss, to earn an automatic bid to the 2013 NCAA tournament. In the tournament, they defeated Saint Mary's in the second round before losing in the third round to Michigan State.\nPre-season.\nThe 2011–12 Memphis Tigers finished the season with a record of 26–9 (13–3 C-USA). The Tigers won the regular season C-USA title as well as the 2012 Conference USA men's basketball tournament to secure a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament where they lost in the second round to Saint Louis.\nIn the off-season, the Tigers lost rising junior Will Barton to the NBA. However, rising sophomore Adonis Thomas, who projected as a possible first-round draft pick, decided to return to Memphis for his second season with the Tigers.\nThe 2012–13 Tigers were ranked 17th in the pre-season AP poll and 16th in the pre-season coaches poll. On November 9, 2012, junior Geron Johnson was suspended by the NCAA for the season's first three games.\nRecruiting.\nThe Tigers signed wing Damien Wilson and power forward Shaq Goodwin in their 2012 recruiting class. After signing with Memphis, Goodwin was selected as a McDonald's All-American. The Tigers also received a commitment from junior college transfer Geron Johnson, a shooting guard. Johnson was rated as the best junior college player in the country and has two years of eligibility in Division 1.\nSeason summary.\nThe Tigers began the season ranked 17th in the AP poll, marking the third year in a row that the Tigers entered the season in the top 25. The Tigers were also the consensus favorite to win the 2013 Conference USA championship.\nThe Tigers' roster was dominated by a fairly large junior class, including guard Joe Jackson, guard Chris Crawford, guard Antonio Barton, forward Tarik Black, and walk on guard Trey Draper. Guard Geron Johnson was also a junior in his first season with Memphis.\nIn the early season Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, Memphis entered with high expectations. However, without Geron Johnson due to suspension in their first game, Memphis was beaten by unranked VCU and unranked Minnesota in its first two Atlantis games before defeating Northern Iowa. Minnesota guard and Memphis native Andre Hollins scored 41 points against his hometown team, while Memphis guard Joe Jackson was limited to 7 minutes of playing time. VCU and Minnesota both went on to be ranked in the AP top 25 after the tournament. The Atlantis results were disappointing for a Tiger squad which did not have a large number of difficult out of conference opponents remaining on its schedule.\nA positive note from the Tigers' trip to the Bahamas was the emergence of forward D.J. Stephens. Stephens, a senior, had been used sparingly while battling injuries and asthma during his first 3 years with the Tigers. Previously known for his extraordinary leaping ability and athleticism who would see time on the floor to bring energy to the team, Stephens began to demonstrate his all-around game, scoring 15 and grabbing 7 rebounds against Minnesota while seeing more than 20 minutes of playing time per game.\nIn late November, junior captain Tarik Black walked out of practice and did not play in the Tigers' game against UT Martin as a result. Black, whose playing time had decreased, was reportedly considering a transfer, though he came back to the team and finished out the season with the Tigers before announcing his intention to transfer as a graduate at season's end.\nOn December 15, the Tigers faced the only ranked opponent left on their regular season schedule, #6 Louisville. The Tigers opened a large lead in the first half against the Cardinals and were up by 7 at halftime. However, the veteran Cardinals defeated Memphis in the end, with Joe Jackson leading the Tigers with 23 points. Louisville went on to win the 2013 national championship.\nAfter the December 15 home loss to Louisville, however, the Tigers began a winning streak that persisted for over two months. Wins during that stretch included at Tennessee, Harvard, at Southern Miss, and UCF. Guard Antonio Barton suffered a foot fracture in the road victory over Southern Miss on February 9. Riding a 14-game winning streak, the Tigers reentered the top 25 in both polls on February 11, 2013.\nWith a win over Southern Miss on February 23, Memphis clinched the regular season Conference USA title. The Tigers finished the season undefeated in Conference USA play. Junior Joe Jackson was named CUSA player of the year and coach Josh Pastner was named coach of the year in the conference. Senior DJ Stephens finished the season as the CUSA blocks leader and was named defensive player of the year. Freshman Shaq Goodwin was named to the all freshman team, junior Chris Crawford the sixth man of the year, Jackson to the all conference first team, and three Tigers (sophomore Adonis Thomas, junior Geron Johnson, and Stephens) to the all conference third team.\nThe Tigers defeated 2 seed Southern Miss in the CUSA tournament final in double overtime. Chris Crawford was named the tournament MVP, having set a career high in 3 pointers made (7) and points (30) in the Tigers semi-final game against Tulsa and scoring 20+ points in each of the Tigers' three tournament games.\nMemphis was given a 6 seed in the Midwest region of the 2013 NCAA tournament. The Tigers defeated 11 seed St. Mary's in the round of 64 before losing to 3 seed Michigan State in the round of 32.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| 2013 Conference USA men's basketball tournament\n!colspan=9|2013 NCAA tournament"

        "text": "The West Indies cricket team toured Australia from November 1979 to January 1980 and played a three-match Test series against the Australia national cricket team. The West Indies won the Test series 2–0, retaining the Frank Worrell Trophy.\nThe series was notable for several major events in cricket history. It was the first Australian season after the rapprochement between the Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket. This was the first time that West Indies played their original \"fearsome foursome\" of fast bowlers, consisting of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner and Colin Croft, in an official Test match. It was also notable for Viv Richards' dominant batting display of 396 runs in 4 innings at an average of 96.50, with a lowest score of 74. His overall aggregate in that tour in international matches was of 881 runs at an astonishing batting average of 97.88. Richards' performance was rated by Australian media as one of the finest ever in Australia. Richards' performance was even more remarkable considering that he was suffering from groin, leg and back injuries throughout the tour. \"Wisden\" described Richards' batting as follows:\nWest Indies won their first Test series on Australian soil. It also marked the beginning of West Indies' dominance in world cricket, as they remained unbeaten for the next 15 years (1980-1995) until eventually losing to Mark Taylor's Australia in 1995.\nThe scheduling of the Test matches was unusual, in that Australia alternated between playing Tests against West Indies and against England. This format was not repeated in subsequent years when two teams toured Australia in the same season.\nIn addition to the Test series, the teams played in a triangular Limited Overs International tournament, the \"World Series Cup\", which also involved the England team. West Indies won this tournament, defeating England in the final.\nBenson &amp; Hedges World Series Cup.\nThe Benson &amp; Hedges World Series Cup was a tri-nation (ODI) series held in Australia from 27 November 1979 to 22 January 1980, between Australia, West Indies and England. The tournament was played in a round-robin format in which England and West Indies reached the finals, and West Indies won the matches 2–0.\nVivian Richards scored the most runs in the tournament with 485 runs (from 7 innings) at an average of 97.00, with his highest score coming against Australia where he scored 153* at the MCG. Dennis Lillee took the most wickets with 20 (in 8 innings) at an average of 12.70."

        "text": "Scott Wilson (born April 24, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who is currently playing with HC Vityaz in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He has played with the Pittsburgh Penguins, with whom he earned two Stanley Cup championships, Detroit Red Wings and Buffalo Sabres in the National Hockey League (NHL).\nWilson was selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft with the 28th pick (209th overall) of the seventh round. Wilson completed his junior season for the UMass Lowell River Hawks in 2014.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nWilson started his junior career on the Georgetown Raiders with a short 7-game stint for the 2008–09 season, scoring one point in the process. The next year Wilson played in every game (56) for the Raiders, finishing the season with 67 points, good enough for third best on the team. Georgetown continued its recent winning ways in 2009–10 season, going 41–10–5 and marched into the playoffs with Scott Wilson among the leaders. After dropping the Villanova Knights 4–2 in the first round, Georgetown fell to the #2-seed Oakville Blades 4–1. In the 11 playoff games Scott Wilson finished second on the Raiders with 17 points (9 goals, 8 assists).\nWilson returned to Georgetown for 2010–11 and put up very similar numbers to his first year, scoring 61 points in 42 games (14 fewer games than the year before). The Raiders slid in the standings, ending up with a 32–15–2–1 record and though it was good enough for them to earn a bye past the qualifier, they entered the round of 16 facing off against the #3-seed Oakville Blades. in a reprise from the previous season, Oakville won the series 4–1. In four games Wilson managed 3 points, a far cry from his previous season. Despite the playoff disappointment, Wilson was able to not only earn a spot on U. Mass-Lowell's roster starting the upcoming fall, but he was also taken by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.\nCollege.\nFrom the start of the 2011–12 season, it was apparent that Lowell would have a resurgence from their abysmal 5-win season the year before when they matched the win total by mid-November. It wasn't until two separate 5-game win streaks that the River Hawks showed how improved they were with new players and under 1st-year coach Norm Bazin. Lowell entered the Hockey East tournament as the #2-seed with a 22–10–1 record, facing the Providence Friars in a best-of-three opening round. Wilson posted a goal and an assist in the first game, but the River Hawks' defence failed them in a 5–3 loss. Lowell won the second game 3–2 in overtime, but couldn't manage any offence in a 1–0 loss as they meekly bowed out of the tournament. Lowell's 23 wins, however, were enough to give them an at-large bid into the 2012 NCAA tournament for the first time in 16 years. the River Hawks were matched up against Miami (Ohio) and dropped the RedHawks 4–3 in overtime. Their tournament was short-lived, however, as they couldn't hold off the #1-seed (3rd overall) Union Dutchmen, losing 4–2. Despite the loss, it was one of Lowells most successful campaigns since they joined Division I hockey in 1984. Though he was held to only an assist in Lowell's final four games, Wilson finished the season second in team scoring with 38 points and was named the Hockey East Rookie-of-the-year.\nReturning for his sophomore season, both Wilson and the River Hawks started 2012–13 very slow. Regardless of their #7 ranking in the USCHO preseason poll, Lowell opened with a 2–5–1 mark with Wilson managing only a single goal in the 8 games. After an 8–2 trouncing of the Massachusetts Minutemen on November 18, followed by freshman goaltender Connor Hellebuyck taking over the starting role in net, the River Hawks got back to their winning ways, going 19–5–1 the rest of the way, including 7- and 9-game winning streaks. during this time Scott Wilson rediscovered his scoring touch, failing to record a point in only 8 of the 25 games after the bad start, helping Lowell cruise into the conference tournament as the number 1 seed, winning their first Hockey East regular season title. Lowell faced Maine in the first round, downing the Black Bears in straight games, 4–2 and 2–1 With Scott Wilson notching 2 goals and an assist in the two games. The second round matchup saw the River Hawks against Providence and after a quick goal from the Friars, it looked like Lowell would be ousted from the Hockey East tournament for the second time in two years, but shortly after the third period started the River Hawks tied the score, allowing Wilson to pot the game-winner with 7:30 left in the game, sending Lowell to the conference title match against the Boston University Terriers. Needing a win to enter the NCAA tournament, Boston University was unable to solve Lowell's defence, but also held the River Hawks off of the score sheet until less than 9 minutes left in regulation when Wilson assisted on the only goal of the game by Derek Arnold, earning U. Mass-Lowell their first ever Hockey East conference title.\nWhile the title victory guaranteed Lowell a spot in the NCAA tournament, their stellar play during the season allowed Lowell to be selected as one of the four #1-seeds (3rd overall) and be placed in the Northeast Regional. In the opening round Lowell was set against the WCHA conference champion Wisconsin Badgers and while Scott Wilson could only manage an assist, nothing else was required as the River Hawks demolished the Badgers 6–1. The next round matched the #2-seed New Hampshire Wildcats against Lowell and Scott Wilson was able to play hero once more, scoring the game-winner with 30 seconds left in the second period and assisting on the only other goal as the River Hawks won 2–0, sending Lowell to the first frozen four in team history. Two weeks later, when the tournament resumed in Pittsburgh, Lowell found themselves down 2–0 early in their semifinal against the Yale Bulldogs. While Lowell was able to tie the game with a pair of goals 14 seconds apart in the 3rd period, Yale scored in overtime, ending Lowell's season two wins short of a national title. 2012–13 ends up being Lowell's most successful Division I season ever in terms of wins (28) winning percentage (.707) and tournament victories (2) as well as their first conference tournament title and conference regular season title. Along the way, Scott Wilson finished tied for the team lead in goals (16) and scoring (38 points) while leading the team outright in power-play goals (6) and game-winning goals (5) despite his slow start.\nProfessional.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nWilson officially signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 1, 2014, and finished the 2013–14 season with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL. His assignment to Wilkes-Barre continued for the 2014–15 season. Wilson spent most of the 2015–16 season with Wilkes-Barre, though he did see action in 24 NHL games and opened the 2016–17 season with parent team.\nWith Chris Kunitz being a late scratch due to a foot fracture, Wilson made his NHL debut on December 2, 2014 in a 1–0 victory over the New Jersey Devils, but played a team-low 4:21 after suffering a leg injury of his own in the second period.\nIn the 2015–16 season, Wilson played with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins for the first half of the year, leading the American Hockey League with 22 goals which earned him a regular NHL spot with Nick Bonino, Eric Fehr, Evgeni Malkin and Beau Bennett on long-term injured reserve. Wilson earned his first career point on a goal by Phil Kessel on December 21, 2015, sending a stretch pass to the right winger for a breakaway. He scored his first NHL goal on February 18, 2016, against Petr Mrazek of the Detroit Red Wings, one timing a Conor Sheary pass from the left-hand side. On March 24, Wilson suffered a lower body injury and missed the rest of the season although Pittsburgh did give him a Stanley Cup ring for his efforts.

        "title": "Bill Wood (baseball)",
        "text": "Bill Wood (born 1941) is an American former baseball executive. He was the general manager (GM) of the Houston Astros from 1987 to 1993. He later worked in the front office of the Cincinnati Reds.\nEarly life.\nWood was born in Wichita Falls, Texas. He studied at the University of Texas and graduated with a degree in business and statistics.\nBaseball career.\nWood started in baseball as the assistant general manager for the Albuquerque Dukes, a farm club of the Los Angeles Dodgers, in 1969. He moved within the Dodgers minor league system to serve as general manager of the Daytona Beach (1970) and El Paso teams (1971-72). After serving as general manager and part-owner of El Paso in 1973, he was hired to serve as assistant to the president of the National Association (the governing body of the minor leagues), and he served under Hank Peters and Bobby Bragan from 1973 to 1976.\nWood was hired in 1976 to work in minor league operations with the Houston Astros. Wood was the assistant director of Scouting and Minor League Clubs for the Astros in 1977 and 1978 before being promoted to serve as the team Director of Minor League Operations from 1979 to 1985. He was the assistant general manager in 1986 and 1987 to Dick Wagner, and he was promoted to GM on December 7, 1987, after being named acting general manager on October 14 with Wagner's resignation.\nWood was noted for drafting 21-year-old prospect Phil Nevin with the first overall pick of the 1992 MLB Draft, even though Astros scout Hal Newhouser had encouraged the team to select high school standout Derek Jeter. Wood later regretted that decision, but he said the team chose Nevin because he would get to the major leagues faster than Jeter. Nevin did have a long career in the major leagues, but Jeter, who was selected sixth by the New York Yankees, because a baseball star.\nWood's most famous trade came under the August 31 deadline in 1990. The Boston Red Sox required a relief pitcher, and Larry Andersen was the one they desired from the Astros. Instead of getting his desired target of prospect Scott Cooper, Wood decided to accept Boston's offer to trade Andersen for prospect Jeff Bagwell (a third baseman on a team that had Wade Boggs entrenched at the position). While Andersen would help the Red Sox win their division that year, Bagwell converted to first base and played with the Astros for 15 seasons in a Hall of Fame career. Wood also was behind the conversion of Craig Biggio (drafted in 1987) from catcher to second base for the 1992 season.\nAt the time he was hired, the club was on the cusp of a downswing that required releasing highlight players of the mid-1980s teams to try and build again. The 1987 team had a 76–86 win-loss record, twenty wins less than the division winning 1986 team. In addition to the trade of Andersen for Bagwell, the team traded players like Bill Doran and Glenn Davis and brought on younger players such as Steve Finley, Curt Schilling, and Pete Harnisch, while experienced pitchers Danny Darwin and Dave Smith were allowed to leave in free agency. Kenny Lofton, who played his first games of his MLB career that year, was traded for a catching prospect and a pitcher on the Cleveland Indians. Darryl Kile (drafted in 1987) also made his impact for Wood's Astros when he made his debut in 1991. Luis Gonzalez (drafted in 1990) was quoted as saying the team had a quality nucleus that deserved to not be \"torn apart\". Nolan Ryan, who pitched for the Astros from 1980 to 1988, left for the Texas Rangers during Wood's tenure with Houston. The Astros had extended an $800,000 contract offer to Ryan rather than the million dollar contract he had played under for nine seasons; despite a second offer of $1.3 million from the Astros, Ryan signed with the Rangers for $1.6 million on December 8, 1988.\nIn Wood's six seasons as GM, the Astros had four seasons of a .500 winning percentage or better while finishing no better than third place in any of the seasons. Wood served as GM until he was fired by owner Drayton McLane (who had bought the team the previous year) on October 6, 1993. Wood was replaced by Bob Watson.\nWood was hired as a special assistant to the GM of the Cincinnati Reds in December 2003 and served in that capacity from 2004 to 2005."

        "text": "In cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five–for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded by critics as a notable achievement, and fewer than 50 bowlers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. Danish Kaneria, a right-arm leg spinner, represented the Pakistan national cricket team in 61 Tests between 2000 and 2010. He took 15 five-wicket hauls during his career in international cricket. Kaneria was described by the BBC as a \"match-winner with his leg-breaks\".\nKaneria made his Test debut in 2000 against England at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad. His first Test five-wicket haul came the following year against Bangladesh at the Multan Cricket Stadium during the 2001–02 Asian Test Championship. Kaneria went on to take his second five-wicket haul in the same match, the only instance in his career where he did so. He accumulated 12 wickets for 94 runs in the match, and the performance earned him the man of the match award. Kaneria's best bowling figures in an innings were 7 wickets for 77 runs against Bangladesh at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka, in January 2002. He was most successful against Australia and Bangladesh, claiming three five-wicket hauls against each of them.\nHaving made his One Day International (ODI) debut in 2001 against Zimbabwe at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Kaneria played 18 matches for Pakistan and took 15 wickets in the format. His best bowling figures in ODIs were 3 wickets for 31 runs against New Zealand at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in 2003. Kaneria never played Twenty20 International matches. , he has taken 15 five-wicket hauls in international cricket; he ranks seventh in the list for Pakistan in all formats of the game combined."

        "text": "Cricket Records was a children's label operated by the Long Island, US based Pickwick Sales Corp., more commonly known as Pickwick Records, and headed by Seymour \"Cy\" Leslie. Pickwick owned and operated several budget labels; Cricket is significant in that it may have been one of the last American 78 rpm labels to operate at the end of the 78 rpm era.\nHistory.\nCy Leslie reorganized Pickwick Sales Corp. in 1952 out of Voco, which had begun in 1946 producing recorded greeting cards, elaborately designed kiddie picture discs with cardboard backings and finally multicoloured vinyl records. Cricket was the successor to Voco, making its debut with Pickwick itself on May 25, 1953; \"my wife's birthday\" as Leslie later recalled. Cricket was the first product line offered by Pickwick Sales Corp. According to Leslie, \"Good fortune introduced me to an early genius, Eli Oberstein. He owned a vast catalog which included many children's albums, which he agreed to lease, thus beginning Pickwick's first licensing – The Pickwick Cricket line of children's records.\" Many of the early records were credited under the collective banner of the \"Cricketone Players,\" or some variant thereof. The 1953 lease from Oberstein produced roughly the first fifty Cricket Records, and the remainder were recorded in a scatter-shot fashion afterward. Cricket singles sold for 49 cents each.\nCricket Records are often anonymous, or credited cryptically to non-entities such as \"Cricketone Orchestra.\" Among established name artists to appear on Cricket were Gene Autry, William Bendix, Smiley Burnette, Bobby Colt, Dennis Day, Eddie Dean, Leif Erickson, Ray Heatherton, Boris Karloff, Joseph Cotten, Maury Laws, Gisele MacKenzie, Norman Rose and David Wayne. Cy Leslie himself is credited on C-85 as the leader of The Calypso Tones. There are no credits on records in the 6-inch series, though these largely duplicate material that appeared in other formats.\nCricket Records started out strong, competing well against Golden Records, the main producer of postwar kiddie records. Leslie recalled that the Golden and Cricket concerns often had their booths set up next to each other at record shows. Cricket Records, however, were not sold in record stores but on racks in department stores and were, therefore, stocked by rack jobbers. Later in the 1950s, Pickwick turned its attention to low-budget licensing deals with majors such as Capitol Records, Mercury Records and RCA Victor. These contracts proved enormously profitable, and required more of Pickwick's attention. In 1968, both Cricket and its sister label Happy Time Records were phased out, though back stock on both labels continued to be available for a time.\nFormats.\nCricket Records were predominantly singles, issued as 7-inch 45s and 10-inch, 7-inch and 6-inch 78s. The main series of singles began at C-11 in 1953 and ended with C-175 in 1967; a separate Christmas series started with CX-6 in 1953 and ended with CX-19 that same year. All Cricket Records had picture sleeves, though in the field they are frequently found without them. LPs were finally introduced in 1959; Cricket only released about 26–30 LPs, starting with CR-11 and ending in 1961 with a series of Bible story albums narrated by Leif Erickson. There are two LPs in a Christmas series; CRX-1 is by David Wayne, \"The Little Star of Bethlehem\" and CRX-2 is an uncredited album titled \"Christmas for Children Only\"; both were issued in 1959. Pickwick established its Happy Time Records subsidiary in 1962; this was predominantly an LP series which used much material from the Cricket Records pool, so it was no longer necessary for Pickwick to issue LPs under the Cricket moniker. Cricket LPs sold for $1.98.\nThe 7-inch series of 78 rpm singles proved one of Cricket Records' most popular and durable formats. While within the United States the 78 rpm format was abandoned industry-wide in 1960, Cricket Records continued to release 7-inch 78 rpm singles afterward, though one source states that this program did not continue after 1963. Nevertheless, stock on Cricket 7-inch 78s remained in print until at least 1968; while the 78 rpm market did not exist, there were still plenty of kiddie record players in use that ran only at 78 rpm, and perhaps Pickwick was answering the slim demand for such records.\nAmong the most memorable of Cricket Records' LP releases was an album featuring two musical stories - \"Once Upon an Orchestra\" and \"The Story of Celeste\", both narrated by David Wayne.\nLogo.\nUnlike the design-heavy – if aesthetically appealing – Voco records, Cricket Records established a more uniform approach to design, employing decorated sleeves and consistent, if sometimes a little crowded, label copy featuring a logo with a cartoon cricket. The Cricket logo itself combined the cartoon cricket with a stylized blue record reading \"Cricket Records\" on 78 issues, but not so on the 45s. The Cricket went through several variants of which the most common was an image of the cricket pointing rightward with a rather demure expression. A later design shows the Cricket sitting atop the blue record from the 78 releases, staring upward, and the cricket also appears in various other contexts in sleeve designs. At some point around 1960, Cricket's label design went through an extreme simplification and the cartoon cricket disappeared, though it reappeared later in a minimal redesign looking more like a bug.\nTie-ins.\nFrom the beginning, Cricket forged ahead with tie-ins to popular toys and television properties, despite that it seldom employed voice actors or other original personnel from TV shows. Paraphrasing Leslie, Billboard reported in March 1956 that Cricket was \"running about 30 per cent ahead of last year ... The toy business takes about 30 per cent of its output now ... the company has signed a flock of familiar TV toys for disk exploitation.\" Announced is the plan to participate with toy manufacturers for a big Christmas advertising push in the fall; \"Tie-ins with Ideal Toys and Fisher-Price give the company exclusive rights to material such as Robert the Robot (sic), the Betsy-Wetsy Doll, etc. The records will get plugs on all TV segs where these toys are exposed.\" One Cricket license that did include original performers was its 1958 agreement with Joe Oriolo's \"Felix the Cat\", resulting in an album produced by Oriolo (\"\"Felix the Cat\",\" CR-28) that bridged actual soundtrack material from the TV cartoons with narrative. Other tie-ins involved Woody Woodpecker, Popeye the Sailor Man, the \"Romper Room\" television series, and Lassie.\nLegacy.\nCricket Records may have produced the very last regular release 78 rpm records in the American market. The latest proposed 78 rpm release is C-166, \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious/Scarlet Ribbons\" credited to the Cricketone Chorus and Orchestra and issued in 1964. The last Cricket release, C-175 \"Born Free/Neverland\" appeared in 1967, and in 1968 Pickwick also stopped producing new Happy Time Records, though the catalog remained active through 1972. At that point, Pickwick reorganized its children's division under the Mr. Pickwick imprint which it had already employed successfully in its UK distribution channels from about 1966. Cy Leslie sold the company to American Can Corporation in 1977, and in 1979 American Can sold Pickwick again to PolyGram. The US rights to Pickwick belong now to Universal Music Group, but the UK subsidiary became an independent operation in 1977 and exists today as Pickwick Group Ltd. None of the material on Cricket has ever been reissued by PolyGram or its successor, Universal Music.\nRecord collectors regard most Cricket Records – indeed, most vinyl products produced by Pickwick – as \"junk.\" There is a measure of affection for the label among baby-boomers and collectors who specialize in kiddie records, though finding copies of Cricket Records with the sleeve intact, and in excellent condition, remains a challenge.\nCricket Promotional Record.\nCricket Records produced a humorous adult themed promotional record. It was a 7\" 78 RPM disc with bright solid yellow labels on each side. One side was simply titled \"This Is Cricket\" and it described the Cricket Record product line and its advantages over competitors (\"Bonus Play\", etc.) as a man-woman risque dialog. It directed listeners to send their orders to Cy Leslie at Pickwick Sales. The flip side was simply titled \"This Is Not Cricket\" and it is a love ballad with one line not suited for children. \"This Is Not Cricket\" has appeared in other song collections under different titles (with an unknown alternate title and performer).\nCricket Records artist roster.\n\"Issue numbers for singles in the main series given without prefixes were originally rendered with a \"C-\" prefix; the Christmas series was lettered \"CX\", here represented merely as \"X.\" LPs were prefixed as \"CR,\" here represented as \"LP\" to avoid confusion. Cricket 201–224 used a variety of letter prefixes, but as the numbers are consecutive, they are not accounted for here.\""

It was the final match of what was intended to be a one-off tournament organised to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Scottish Football League however it continued for the next season. The match marked the first time Ayr United had reached the final of a national cup competition in its 80-year history whilst it was Dundee's first since contesting the 1980 Scottish League Cup final ten years beforehand.\nThe tournament was contested by clubs below the Scottish Premier Division with both finalists from the First Division. Ayr United scored first through Ian McAllister after 12 minutes but Billy Dodds scored twice to give Dundee a 2–1 lead; his first a penalty kick and second a header in the 72nd minute. Three minutes later David Smyth scored Ayr United's second goal to level the match at 2–2 to force extra time.

It should not be confused with the FIS Ski Flying World Championships, which are a separate one-off event contested biennially during the World Cup season, but with points not counting towards it.\nFour World Championships in ski flying organized in 1992, 1994, 1996 and 1998 also counted for World Cup points.\nFrom 1979/80 until 1989/90 ski flying world cup events were organized as K.O.P. Ski Flying Week Tournaments and were not awarded with trophies but counted in overall ranking. Ski Flying World Cup was first time officially organized from 1990/91 until 2000/01 and after eight years break again since 2008/09 have been awarded with small crystal globe. Only forty competitors can enter the competition.\nFirst individual event organized in 1980 is the only world cup event in history where single event took three days in total. First team event in history was organized in 2000 in Planica.\nThere are six ski flying hills that exists in the world: Planica, Oberstdorf, Vikersund, Kulm, Harrachov and Ironwood. They are joined in the »K.O.P.« (Kulm-Oberstdorf-Planica) ski flying hills association founded in 1962 in Ljubljana. The only hill located outside of Europe is Ironwood which is expected to be reopened and covered with plastic mate in 2017 as the only flying hill active all year round.\nFirst test flights for women are provided in season 2023/2024 in case women jump technique developed at same speed. According to the results women competition should start next season.\nScoring system.\nEach season consists of 2–7 competitions, usually two competitions on the same hill during a weekend. One competition consists of a qualifying round, first round and second round. The top 10 jumpers in FIS ranking qualify directly to the first round, while the rest of the jumpers fight for the remaining 30 spots. The top 30 men in the first round advance to the second round, which is held in reverse order, so the best jumper in the first round jumps last. The aggregate score in the first and second rounds determine the competition results. The top 30 are awarded World Cup points. The winner gets 100 points while number 30 receives 1 point. At team events only top 8 receive points.\nVarious.\nSki flying rankings overall leader.\nupdated: 25 February 2024"

        "text": "Mark Waugh is a former Australian cricketer who scored centuries (100 or more runs) in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Described by ESPNcricinfo writer John Polack as \"one of the world's most elegant and gifted strokemakers\", he played most of his career under the captaincy of his older twin-brother Steve Waugh. Waugh represented Australia in 128 Test matches and 244 ODIs between 1988 and 2002, scoring 20 and 18 centuries respectively. He was primarily a batsman who played as an opener in ODIs, while normally at number four in Tests.\nWaugh made his Test debut against England at the Adelaide Oval in January 1991, scoring a century; he became the fifteenth player from Australia to score a hundred on debut when he made 138 in the innings. He ended the season with one more century, aggregating 554 runs at an average of 61.55. Following his performances, \"Wisden\" Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year the same year. Waugh was instrumental in Australia's victory in the 1995 Frank Worrell Trophy against the West Indies when he made 126 in the deciding game. His highest score of 153 not out was achieved against India during the third Test of the 1998 Border–Gavaskar Trophy in Bangalore. In Tests, Waugh was most successful against England scoring six centuries. As of , his position is eleventh in the list of Test century-makers for Australia.\nAlthough Waugh made his ODI debut against Pakistan in December 1988, he did not score his first century until four years later. Between his debut and the 1996 World Cup he made five centuries, all against different opponents. Waugh was more prolific at the 1996 World Cup scoring three centuries. Waugh set the record for the highest individual score by an Australian when he made 173 against the West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 2001. The following month he scored a match-winning 133 not out against India at Nehru Stadium in Pune which also became his last century in the format. Despite a slow start to his ODI career, he became the third highest century-maker in ODIs at the time of scoring his last century."

        "title": "J. T. Brown (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Joshua Thomas Brown (born July 2, 1990) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger. He is a TV analyst for the Seattle Kraken.\nPlaying career.\nCollegiate.\nBrown attended the University of Minnesota Duluth after playing junior hockey in the United States Hockey League (USHL) with the Waterloo Black Hawks. In 2011, he was named the Most Outstanding Player after winning the 2011 Frozen Four national championship with the Bulldogs.\nProfessional.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nUndrafted in the NHL, Brown signed a two-year, entry level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 28, 2012. Upon signing with Tampa Bay, Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said, \"I'm anxious to see him play.\" On March 31, 2012, Brown made his NHL debut in Tampa Bay's 3–2 overtime victory against the Winnipeg Jets. On April 7, he recorded his first career NHL assist in a 4–3 overtime win, also coming against the Winnipeg Jets.\nOn September 9, 2012, the Tampa Bay Lightning assigned Brown, as well as 17 other players, to the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League (AHL), their top minor league affiliate. This was done in part due to the ongoing 2012–13 NHL lockout that cancelled the first half of the 2012–13 season until late January. On December 28, 2012, Brown sustained a shoulder injury in a 4–2 Crunch victory over the Norfolk Admirals. Prior to the injury, Brown had six goals, 17 points and four penalty minutes in 26 games for Syracuse. It was revealed later in the day that Brown had suffered a broken collarbone, which required surgery to repair. Although expected to compete for a roster spot with the Lightning once NHL play resumed, the injury was expected to sideline him for six-to-eight weeks.\nOn July 7, 2013, Tampa Bay announced that they had re-signed Brown to a one-year, two-way contract. At the end of the season, Brown had skated in 51 games with the Crunch, recording 10 goals and 28 points to go along with 27 penalty minutes. Additionally, he played in 18 Calder Cup playoff games with Syracuse, registering four goals and nine points to go along with 18 penalty minutes.\nOn September 29, 2013, Brown was reassigned to the Crunch by the Lightning as part of roster cuts for the upcoming 2013–14 season. On November 11, 2013, however, Tampa Bay recalled Brown from Syracuse. Prior to being recalled, Brown was on a two-game point streak, with a goal and an assist. It was during this time that he received the nickname \"Brownov\" as the third player on a successful forward line with Russians Vladislav Namestnikov and Nikita Kucherov.\nOn November 16, 2013, Brown scored his first career NHL goal in a 6–3 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes.\nOn June 6, 2014, the Lightning announced the re-signing of forward Brown to a two-year, one-way contract. He appeared in 63 games with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season, posting four goals and 19 points while averaging 13:02 in ice time per game. Brown also played in all four Stanley Cup playoff games in 2014, notching two assists in Tampa Bay's four-game series defeat at the hands of the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference First Round. During the post-season, Brown was averaging 14:59 minutes in ice time.\nOn May 3, 2015, Brown scored his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal in a 6–2 Lightning win over the Montreal Canadiens in the Eastern Conference Second Round in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nOn June 24, 2016, the Lightning announced the re-signing of Brown to two-year contract extension. Brown played in 78 regular season games during the past season, recording eight goals and 22 points. Brown was tied for third on the team with a plus-16 rating. Brown set career bests in games played, goals, points, plus/minus and penalty minutes last season. He also appeared in nine Stanley Cup Playoff games, recording two assists and two penalty minutes. Brown has skated in 198 career NHL games, all with the Lightning over four seasons, registering 15 goals and 51 points. He also has skated in 37 playoff games, recording a goal and six points.\nOn October 15, 2016, Brown skated in his 200th career NHL game, which came during a 3–2 Lightning win over the visiting New Jersey Devils.\nAnaheim Ducks.\nIn his sixth season with the Lightning in the 2017–18 season, Brown was used in a reduced role. On January 13, 2018, Brown was placed on waivers by the Lightning after appearing in 24 games, and was then claimed by the Anaheim Ducks on January 14. Brown played out the season with the Ducks, contributing with 1 goal and 3 points in 23 games in a fourth-line role.\nMinnesota Wild.\nAs a free agent from the Ducks in the off-season, Brown opted to return to his home state, securing a two-year $1.375 million contract with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2018.\nIF Björklöven.\nWhen the 2020–21 NHL season began on January 13, 2021, Brown was without a contract. One week later, on January 20, 2021, he signed a one-year contract with IF Björklöven of the HockeyAllsvenskan league.\nInternational play.\nBrown played with the U.S. national team at the 2012 IIHF World Championship. He scored his first goal against Kazakhstan on May 11, 2012.\nPost-playing career.\nOn June 21, 2021, Brown joined Root Sports Northwest as a color commentator for the Seattle Kraken. On February 17, 2022, Brown and Everett Fitzhugh called the Kraken's game against the Winnipeg Jets. The pairing was the first all-Black TV broadcast in NHL history.\nPersonal life.\nBrown was born in High Point, North Carolina, and was raised in Rosemount, Minnesota. Brown is the son of former National Football League (NFL) running back Ted Brown, who played eight NFL seasons (1979–1986) for the Minnesota Vikings. In an interview, Brown gave credit to his father for having played a vital role in being able to push his game to new heights. Speaking about his father, \"he has always been someone to lean on. He and the rest of my family always have always really supported me. I can't thank them enough.\"\nOn February 6, 2015, Brown married Lexi LaFleur. The couple have two children.\nOn September 28, 2017, before a preseason season game versus the Florida Panthers, Brown raised his fist during the U.S. national anthem, in an attempt to \"bring awareness to police brutality and inequality for minorities.\" He did the same on an October 7 game also against the Panthers, becoming the first NHL player to protest during the anthem in a regular season game. He stated that he had \"received death threats\" after the protest. In the week following, he and a few teammates met with members of the Tampa Police Department after receiving an invitation from the interim police chief. On October 18, Brown announced that he would no longer raise a fist during the anthem, but would continue to work to bring awareness around issues of police brutality and other racial inequalities and injustices.\nIn July 2018, Brown founded a charity marathon \"Fortnite\" event to raise funds for Hockey Is For Everyone."

        "title": "UST Growling Tigers basketball",
        "text": "The UST Growling Tigers basketball is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Santo Tomas. The school has won 19 basketball titles including one in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They are one of the winningest teams in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) with 18 championships, the last coming in 2006 during Pido Jarencio's rookie year of coaching. Jarencio returned as the team's head coach after ten years since resigning in 2013. He formally replaced Bal David on February 3, 2023.\nSchedule overview.\nThe Growling Tigers' preparation for the season begins in late-March, or at the tailend of the academic year. It was recently moved to late-April following a shift in the opening of the school calendar from June to August. UST usually plays in two major preseason tournaments for two to three months and they sometimes join provincial pocket tournaments in the lead-up to the UAAP tournament. On many occasions, a Team B lineup from their training pool is fielded to competitions that run parallel to another tournament.\nAmong the off-season tournaments that the Growling Tigers participate in are the Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup, MILCU Under-25 Summer tournament, Breakdown Basketball Invitational tournament, PBA D-League Aspirants' Cup and the Father Martin Cup.\nIn the 14-game UAAP men's basketball tournament, the Tigers play from twice to thrice weekly against the seven other member collegiate teams in the course of the two round-robin elimination games from early September until mid-November. Playoff games may last until December, after which the postseason tournaments begin.\nIn the postseason, UST usually qualifies to participate in the Philippine Collegiate Champions League, depending on their rank from the concluded UAAP season.\nHistory.\nThe Growling Tigers were originally known as the \"Glowing Goldies,\" with the name derived from UST's school colors of gold and white. Their colors were in turn inspired by the flag of the Papal States since their pontifical status was obtained in 1902.\nEarly years.\nThe history of UST's basketball program dates back to 1920 when they joined the \"Liga Catolica,\" an interscholastic sports league of Manila-based Catholic schools that was founded by San Beda, La Salle, Ateneo, Letran, and San Vicente de Paul College.\nThe Glowing Goldies co-founded the NCAA in 1924 and won their first and only championship in 1930. They were coached by Chito Calvo who also served as the school's director of physical education. The team improved from being cellar dwellers in 1928 to finishing second in the standings behind University of the Philippines in 1929.\nAn experimental sports meet among the triumvirate of UP, UST and National University called the \"Big Three\" and formed in 1930, arose from the schools' dissatisfaction with the NCAA's plan to incorporate the league with the Bureau of Commerce. A permission to stage the games was eventually granted by the league on the condition that NCAA events would be given priority over the use of sports facilities. The three schools later withdrew from the NCAA and the Big Three was formally inaugurated as a league in 1932. The Goldies won the championships from 1931 to 1934 behind the exploits of their three national team members, Jacinto Ciria Cruz, Primitivo Martinez, and Herminio Silva.\nApart from the Big Three League, the Goldies also competed in the National Open Championship and tournaments organized by the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation where they won titles in 1935, 1937, 1940, and 1941.\nWith the addition of Far Eastern University to the group in 1938, the Big Three League was dissolved and the UAAP was inaugurated. The Goldies lost to the Tamaraws in a game that decided the tournament's first champion. UST went on to record their first back-to-back championships in the next two years, although the 1939 crown was shared with FEU and UP when they all finished with identical 4–2 win–loss records. Herr Silva, who had ventured into coaching after the 1938 season took over the Goldies when Dr. Jose Rodríguez resigned. The 1940 champion team became known to sports scribes as the \"Captains' Team\" due to the presence of five skippers in the lineup. Aside from then team captain Gabby Fajardo, the others who had served as the Goldies' leaders in past tournaments were Francisco Vestil, Salvador Siao, Enrique Novales, and Gabby's brother Fely who was a transferee from Letran.\nPostwar era.\nThe postwar resumption of the UAAP in 1946 after a five-year absence saw the Glowing Goldies record their first undefeated season when they won all six of their games to claim their third straight championship. The team was honored in a ceremony on May 12, 1996, to commemorate the 50th year of the championship.\nThe following year, the Goldies were declared co-champions with FEU for the second time in the UAAP. In the deciding match, UST was leading towards the end of regulation when a power outage struck the Rizal Memorial Coliseum, forcing play to stop. When power had not been restored after an hour, the tournament organizers decided to award the 1947 championship to both teams. Francisco Vestil was named Most valuable player of the season.\nUST won over FEU again in 1949 for their sixth straight championship. It was their fourth straight title in the postwar era. The Tamaraws got their revenge when they defeated the Goldies for the UAAP, as well as the Intercollegiate championships in 1950.\nRedemption came early for UST when they won the 1951 National Open Championships in January after defeating the San Miguel Braves team of their former coach Chito Calvo, 47–41 in the Finals. This was the last time that a team from the UAAP won the National Open. The Glowing Goldies went on to win their first unshared three-peat championship in the UAAP from 1951 to 1953. In the 1951 UAAP Finals, Coach Silva put into play his peculiar strategy of dribbling the ball until time ran out. UST preserved their lead over FEU and went on to win the championship on a 43–34 score. Ning Ramos was selected MVP by the Philippine Sportswriters Association in 1952. He was joined by teammate Ramon Manulat in the Mythical team selection.\nThe Goldies finished third behind FEU and first time champions NU in 1954. Francis Wilson was included in the PSA's Mythical first team selection, while Eddie Pacheco made it to the second team.\nIn 1955, Fely Fajardo replaced longtime coach Herr Silva after the latter had fallen ill during his coaching stint at the 1954 World Championship in Brazil. UST was back to their winning ways when they dethroned NU for the UAAP title and then claimed the National Intercollegiate Championship in the postseason after beating University of the Visayas, 76–66. In the National Finals, the Goldies forced an overtime when team captain Andy Bautista converted both free throws to tie the score at 62–all. Wilson led the team in scoring with 21 points, while Jose Petel, Egie Serafico, and Benjamin Cabrera added 15, 12, and 10 points respectively.\nUST–UE rivalry.\nThe Glowing Goldies met University of the East in the 1957 Final, in what was to be their first of eight championship meetings that spans until the beginning of the 1970s decade. The Warriors joined the league as an expansion team in 1952 with Manila Central University, Adamson, and the University of Manila. UST lost to UE, 55–64.\nUST got back at UE in 1959 by breaking their back-to-back championship streak after winning, 66–55. The Goldies who won the first round pennant struggled in the next round and had to go through a playoff against FEU in order to qualify for the right to face the defending champions in the Finals. They defeated the Tamaraws, 84–67 and then went on to deploy a tight man-to-man defense against the Warriors in the championship game. They had succeeded in limiting UE's leading scorer Roehl Nadurata to only four points, all of which came from free throws. The 6'3\" Asencion Aparicio who hardly played long minutes was responsible for the defense on Nadurata. The Goldies' center was equally effective on offense when he scored 20 points in the game. This was the 11th championship won by UST since their 1939 title.\nA loss to FEU in the four-team championship round prevented the Glowing Goldies from defending their championship. They made it to the semifinals by defeating the MCU Tigers, 87–72 in a playoff for the fourth and last berth where UE, FEU and UP had already qualified. FEU's Romy Diaz set a new scoring record when he tallied 40 points in ousting UST, 91–81 from the 1960 Finals. Valentino Rosabal won the 1960 Rookie of the year award.\nIn 1963, the UAAP introduced the twice-to-beat advantage format for the first time to replace the existing one-game championship. UST defeated UE in two games, but the victory was placed under protest by the Warriors. The subject of the protest was a UST player's ineligibility for having played for a commercial team in the National Open in the summer, which was against league rules. The protest was upheld by the UAAP board, and as a result awarded the championship to UE. The Warriors also became the recipients of the El Oro trophy for having been champions for three straight years. Rosabal was named MVP, while point guard Aric del Rosario won the 1963 Rookie of the year award.\nUST did not have a promising start to their 1964 season. They lost to the University of the Visayas in the National Collegiate Championship in March and Fajardo had stepped down as coach at the start of the UAAP tournament in September. Sonny Reyes and Orly Bauzon, their team's top scorers dropped out of the team to play in the MICAA. Herr Silva returned as their interim coach, but the Goldies still lost their opening game against UE, 81–82. Things began to look up when Caloy Loyzaga, who had just retired as a player in April got on board to be the team's permanent head coach. The Goldies won their next games and got back at UE on a close 58–57 win to qualify to the Finals against FEU. UST had erased FEU's twice-to-beat advantage and turned the championship into a best-of-three affair when they won, 61–60. Aric del Rosario scored all of his team's points to put the Goldies ahead 60–55 from a 53–54 deficit. In the next game, FEU's Rolando Mojica scored 35 points to lead his team over UST, 69–58 and extend the Finals to a deciding third game. It was another close game with a series of one-point lead changes until the final ten seconds when the Goldies' Romeo Ramos was fouled by an FEU defender while driving to the basket. Ramos split his free throws to tie the score at 64–all as time ran out in regulation. UST managed to get the 71–68 overtime win and the championship. According to sports historian Jose Maria Escoda, newspapers at that time described the UST–FEU series as the most exhilarating matchup in the postwar history of the UAAP.\nThe Goldies met UE again in the 1965 UAAP Finals. They prevented the Warriors from scoring a season sweep after winning their second-round game, 74–70 in overtime. They ended up tied at first place in the standings with identical 7-1 records. The Goldies won the first game of the best-of-three series, 69–67 after Danny Florencio, their rookie forward out of FEATI University made back-to-back steals that were converted to baskets in the game's final seconds. The Warriors retaliated with a 72–65 win in Game 2, and then took the crown in the deciding third game of the series. Florencio erupted for 40 points, but fouled out after committing two quick fouls on UE's Sonny Jaworski, the last coming in the final ten seconds of the game and with the score tied at 84–all. The Warriors forced two turnovers on UST and scored the last four points for an 88–84 victory.\nThe 1966 preseason bore testament to the tenacity of the Goldies' rivalry with the Warriors when their National Collegiate game ended in a brawl. UST was trying to prevent UE from once again completing a sweep when in the last four seconds of the game, a ten-minute long fight broke out on the playing court. The game was stopped as the referees were unable to take control of the situation, with the Goldies trailing 67–73. As a result of a hearing held by the Basketball Association of the Philippines, six players from both teams were each handed down a one-year suspension. UE's Jaworski, Nat Canson, Fernando Paseos, and UST's Florencio, team captain Manuel Tan, and Ceferino dela Paz were the recipients of the ban for throwing fists and elbows during the altercation. The penalties were later reduced to six months upon appeal by both schools, but the players would still miss the first month of the UAAP tournament which was set to start in August. The Warriors were awarded the National Collegiate championship, citing a rule that if the game is interrupted after the 35th minute, the team that leads is declared the winner. The two teams met again to contest the UAAP crown after finishing the elimination rounds with identical 6–2 records. The Goldies were swept in the best-of-three series, with the second game ending on a close 77–78 score.\nEgie Serafico was appointed head coach after the 1966 season when Caloy Loyzaga resigned to assume coaching duties for the national team. UST faced the Warriors for the third straight year in the 1967 UAAP Finals. The series had been contested once again in a deciding third game, which took a strange turn at the start of the second half. Both Serafico and Baby Dalupan, coaches of the two opposing teams refused to be the first to submit to the game officials their list of their starting five prior to the tip-off. Even as the Glowing Goldies led by 11 points at 51–40 at halftime, their starters led by Bogs Adornado, Lawrence Mumar, and Cirilo Fabiosa were already in foul trouble. After repeated warnings to both teams, referee Antonio Esclabanan declared the game a no contest, citing the unsportsmanlike behavior of the two coaches. The league later recognized UST and UE as co-champions of the season.\nThe Goldies ended up as runners-up to the Warriors for two more years in 1968 and 1971, sandwiching UE's two undefeated seasons in 1969 and 1970 where they were declared automatic champions. UST was the last team to try to prevent the sweep in 1969 after all the other three teams lost to UE in the elimination games. The Goldies went unsuccessful and bowed to the Warriors, 96–105. UE won two more games for a 10–0 sweep the following year, adding victories over the UAAP's sixth member, the Adamson Falcons who had been readmitted to the league that year.\nCordero and Jarencio eras.\nFormer UST forward Francis Wilson was appointed head coach in 1975. He had only managed to steer the team to a fifth-place finish that year, and despite a turnaround season in 1976 where they ended up as third placers, four of the Goldies' senior players left to play in the MICAA after a rumored falling-out with the coaching staff. This left the 1977 roster with eight rookies and six second-stringers, with the exception of third year guard Ray Obias who became a scoring revelation the previous season. While the Glowing Goldies were no longer championship contenders, their rivalry with UE continued when the two teams battled towards the end of eliminations for the #4 rank in the standings. UST prevailed with a down-the-wire 76–75 win. They were actually leading at 76–72 with 43 seconds left in the game, but the Warriors scored three straight unanswered points. The Goldies weathered the uprising by keeping possession from the remaining five seconds until the buzzer. UST next defeated UP to prevent them from entering the Finals against FEU. Edmund Yee, Ricky Valero, and Danny Calsado led the Goldies with their balanced scoring, but it was the team's 18 steals that carried UST to victory. The Goldies ended up at fourth in the standings with 5 wins and 5 losses, while UE fell to fifth with a 4–6 record.\nSerafico came back to replace Wilson as UST's coach in 1978. He had laid out a two-year rebuilding plan for the team that has failed to advance to the postseason in recent years. The Glowing Goldies had again become UE's adversary when they met in 1979 for the playoff that would determine FEU's opponent in the Finals. Both teams ended the eliminations with a 9–3 record. UST came out on top with a 114–104 win and dethroned the Warriors, who held the 1978 title. Yee led in scoring with 34 points, but it was his collaboration with Ed Cordero and Frank Natividad that gave the team the win. The three combined for 28 points in an eight-minute stretch to surmount UE's 60–45 lead in the second half. Serafico's program saw an early success with the Goldies' entry to the Finals. UST's offense was anchored mainly on Cordero, the team's center who had set a scoring record when he finished with 54 points against Adamson in the first round. He later revealed that he had been nursing a fever prior to the playoff game against UE. His condition worsened and was hospitalized after the game, making him unavailable to play in the championship where FEU held a twice-to-beat advantage. Natividad and Yee took up the scoring cudgels with 38 and 25 respectively, but were soundly beaten, 89–100. The team trailed FEU at the half, 27–51.\nLike in 1969, the Goldies were again faced with the task of preventing an automatic championship by a rival team. FEU went undefeated in 11 games and their last scheduled match in the two round-robin eliminations of the 1980 season was against UST. Cordero, who was still the center of the team's offense was supported in their starting lineup by Edgar Bilasano, Louis Cu, Nestor Lugue, and Paquito Maristela. Maristela had replaced the already graduated Edmund Yee at the forward position. The 6'4\" Cesar Calayag alternated with Lugue in guarding Anthony Williams, their opponent's high-scoring American forward. The Goldies who had trailed FEU, 37–42 at the half opened up a rally led by rookie Raymond Fran to put the team to within two at 49–51. The lead changes went back and forth until the 69–70 count, with UST trailing. Both teams went scoreless in the next three minutes until Cu and the Tamaraws' Jojo Valle traded baskets to up the score to 71–72 with 34 seconds left in the game. A botched play off the Goldies' last timeout caused the team a 30-second violation. In the next play, FEU held on to the ball until the buzzer sounded and were declared champions of the season. Serafico later resigned and was replaced by Eddie Pacheco, another former Goldie as the team's head coach.\nPido Jarencio set the scoring record for the season in 1982 when he made 50 points in their 116–93 win over NU in the first round. The team opened their season with an 82–91 loss to Adamson where Jarencio topscored for 15 points. Charlie Badion, who led Mapúa to the 1981 NCAA championship replaced Pacheco as coach of the Glowing Goldies. UST had the chance to qualify to the 1983 Finals when they tied UP at second place at the end of eliminations with an 8–4 record. They defeated the Maroons both times in the eliminations, with the second-round game ending on a 76–71 score. UP got payback by beating the Goldies in the playoff for the second Finals slot, which ended on a close 87–85 score. Jarencio was selected to the Mythical team that year.\nThe 1984 UAAP Finals was a best-of-three series, where the Glowing Goldies were once again facing UE. UST won in Game 2, behind Jarencio's 34 points to avenge their Game 1 loss to the Warriors. The Goldies kept up with UE's offense until the first five minutes of the second half when the Warriors started to shift gears to win the championship on a 112–99 score. Jarencio and UE's Allan Caidic, front runners in the MVP race turned the game into a shooting contest by scoring 48 and 46 points respectively. Jarencio, who was hobbled with four fouls from as early as the 22nd minute failed to get support from his teammates as he scored most of their points in the second half. The Goldies trailed by as much as 19 points late in the game. They had defeated UE in both games of the elimination rounds.\nThe Goldies and the Warriors met again in the 1985 UAAP Finals. The two teams were on equal footing as UE topped the first round with a 5–1 record, while the Goldies became the tournament's #1 seed with 9 wins against 3 losses. UE's lone loss in the first round was to the Glowing Goldies with Jarencio scoring a season high 43 points. The Warriors defeated FEU in a playoff for the second seed qualifier and then handily defeated UST in two games to crown themselves as champions for the second straight year.\nPlayer migration.\nIn 1987, the Glowing Goldies had to drop their top scorer Bennett Palad and big man Rabbi Tomacruz from the roster due to academic deficiencies. Tomacruz had failed to enroll in time for the submission of the lineup, making him ineligible for the season. Sophomore recruits Fedencio Oblina, and Rohimust Santos, Jr. stepped up in place of Palad and Tomacruz. After placing fourth at the end of the first round, UST won back-to-back games to move up to a tie for third place at the standings. It was then that officials of Adamson filed a protest against one of their players. The UAAP Board found Oblina to be ineligible for failing his NCEE qualifying tests which resulted to the reversal of four of UST's won games. The Glowing Goldies dropped to 7th place in the standings at 2–7 from their original 6–3 record. Aric del Rosario sat out in their next game and was replaced by then coach of the women's team Orly Bauzon. Oblina was handed a lifetime ban by the UAAP. The Goldies ended the season with 3 wins against 11 losses.\nBauzon formally replaced Del Rosario as the Goldies' head coach for the 1988 season. Palad was excluded from the roster for the second straight year for having exceeded the five-year playing limit in the UAAP. The league counted his participation in the PABL in 1987 as a playing year despite his absence from the UAAP. To add to the team's woes, starting point guard Alfrancis Chua quit the team in the first round of eliminations after a misunderstanding with a member of the coaching staff. Chua's decision to leave was finalized after a meeting with Bauzon and PE director Fr. Franklin Beltran. UST ended their season at seventh place for the second year with the same 3–11 record.\n1989 saw a shakeup in UST's basketball program when the nucleus of their Golden Nuggets juniors basketball team made a surprising transfer to rival Adamson in the summer. The Nuggets, regarded as the tallest basketball team in the country with their 6'11\" team captain EJ Feihl, 6'8\" Marlou Aquino, and 6'6\" Giovanni Pineda in the lineup had lost Aquino, Pineda, Manuel Cucio, and Gerard Hipolito in the transfer. Joining the high school players were the Nuggets' head coach Hector Hipolito and his assistant Charlie Dy, as well as seniors coach Orly Bauzon and sophomore player Bong dela Cruz, who was also a former Golden Nugget. Reports say that the exodus was caused by a rift between the school's administration and the coaching staff.\nThe Glowing Goldies made a turnaround in 1990 from their dismal 2-win season in 1989. They won eight straight games, with one coming from a reversal of their 10-point first round loss to La Salle after Green Archer Noli Locsin was declared ineligible by the board. The strong start was partly attributed to the presence of Feihl, their now 7-foot tall rookie center. Feihl unfortunately fell ill in the middle of the season and UST went on to lose all their remaining games for an 8–6 record and a tie at fourth place with FEU in the standings.\nDespite Feihl's transfer to Adamson in 1991, the Goldies had a winning season, where they began their UAAP campaign on a five-game winning streak. They defeated FEU, 114–84 on opening day and went on to beat Ateneo, NU, and Adamson in their next games. They trailed the Falcons by more than ten points at the half, but made a comeback to win, 103–101. Their next match against UE also yielded a close 74–72 win before suffering back-to-back losses to close out the first round at second place with a 5–2 record. They won all but one game in the second round with an 80–85 loss to La Salle. They ended up tied with FEU at second place with an 11–3 record. They lost by six points to the Tamaraws in the playoff to determine La Salle's opponent in the Finals on an 89–95 score. The Goldies had complained of spotty officiating in the game, which at one point in the second half resulted to a 20-minute debris-pelting protest from the stands. The game, though, had not been close with FEU leading by as much as 23 points, and even as the Goldies were able to limit them to only two points coming from free throws in the last three and a half minutes, they were only able to come within nine points. The Goldies were also outrebounded by their opponents, 23–35. Dennis Espino, who made it to the Mythical selection topscored for UST with 23 points.\nThe Growling Tigers.\nAs hosts of the 1992 tournament, UST unveiled a new mascot during the UAAP opening ceremonies following a change in their varsity moniker from the \"Glowing Goldies\" to the \"Tigers\". The move behind the renaming of the team was recalled in a 2007 speech by returning rector Fr. Rolando dela Rosa when he first assumed the position in 1991. Because the Goldies literally represented the gold and white school colors, UST never had a mascot for their varsity teams. The Tiger was chosen after Dela Rosa instructed Bro. Rolando Atienza, UST's PE moderator to come up with an appropriate mascot. For the second time in UAAP history, the Golden Tigers met FEU in a game that was interrupted by a power outage. Prior to the game, UST was tied with the Tamaraws at first place with a 10–2 record. They lost to La Salle, 80–82 and FEU lost to Adamson, resulting to a quadruple tie among the four teams with 10–3 records. In the Tigers' last game in the eliminations, power went out at the Loyola Center with 3:47 remaining in the game and with UST trailing, 56–68. The UAAP board decided to reschedule the last three minutes of the game on a later date. UST ended up losing, 76–87 and settled for fourth place with 10 wins against 4 losses. Team captain Udoy Belmonte and Rey Evangelista were chosen to the Mythical first team, while Espino made it to the second team.\n14–0 season.\nIn 1993, the UAAP implemented the Final Four semifinal playoffs to replace the outright Finals series between the top two teams. The Tigers started their season with a 27-point blowout win over Ateneo, and then went on to have easy wins in their next three games, including another 31-point rout over NU. Their next game against FEU was once again marred by a power failure when they played at the Araneta Coliseum, though the game was finished after a long delay with UST prevailing, 78–66. The team had been winning their games consistently that even when Aric del Rosario failed to show up in their match against NU due to a scheduling conflict, they were still able to win by 17 points. The Final Four was negated as the Tigers went on to sweep all 14 of their games and were declared automatic champions. Espino, who was declared MVP made it to the Mythical selection with teammates Patrick Fran and Rey Evangelista. Udoy Belmonte was selected to the Mythical second team.\nUST–La Salle rivalry.\nThe Growling Tigers met La Salle in the 1994 UAAP Finals for the first time since their overtime loss in the 1948 National Open Championship title match. The Green Archers joined the league as the UAAP's eighth member in 1986 under controversial circumstances. The school first applied for membership in 1981, but was denied when three of the seven-member schools voted against their acceptance due to the violent reputation brought about by their recent championship game in the NCAA. UST was among those that voted out La Salle. The school managed to get two-thirds of votes in their favor in 1985, paving the way to their entry to the UAAP.\nEven with Adamson's suspension in 1994, the Tigers still struggled and could only manage to land at fourth place at the end of the first round with 3 wins against 3 losses. They turned the season around by winning five games including four straight in the second round for an 8–4 record that was good for third place and a spot in the Final Four playoffs. The Tigers also denied La Salle a season sweep when they won, 68–66 in the second round to also avenge their 73–83 loss in the previous round. They overcame UE's twice-to-beat advantage in the semifinals and had to force a deciding Game 3 in the Finals against La Salle to win their third back-to-back title since the 1948–49 and 1952–53 seasons. The Tigers also helped to achieve the UAAP's first and only triple championship after the Tiger Cubs and the Tigresses earlier won the titles in their respective divisions. Espino was named season MVP for the second straight year.\nUST met La Salle and won the championship two more times in 1995 and 1996 for their second four-peat since the 1946–49 seasons. They topped the 1995 eliminations with an 11–3 record, but like in 1994, they had to beat the Archers in three games to win the title. They also struggled to defeat their Finals opponent in the second round by overcoming two overtime periods for an 87–84 win. They came in at second behind La Salle in the standings after the 1996 eliminations with a 10–4 record, but were able to sweep them in the best-of-three Finals. With the 1996 title, the Tigers became the second winningest team in the UAAP behind UE after claiming their 17th title. Chris Cantonjos won the 1995 MVP award, while Estong Ballesteros was selected to the 1996 Mythical team.\nThe Growling Tigers met the Green Archers yet again in the 1997 Final Four playoffs with UST holding a twice-to-beat advantage. The two teams split their two round-robin elimination games and finished with identical 10–4 records, but the Tigers had a superior +5 quotient over the Archers. UST lost in two games, with Game 2 going into overtime at 72–74.\nAfter winning, 80–72 against UP in the playoff for the fourth semifinal slot, the Tigers faced the top-seeded Green Archers for their 1998 Final Four match. They lost in two games after taking Game 1 on a 55–51 win.\nThe Growling Tigers made it back to the Finals in 1999 and went up against La Salle for the fourth time since 1994. UST featured a rookie-laden roster, but among the players were four junior MVPs in Alwyn Espiritu, Derick Hubalde, Marvin Ortiguerra, and Emmerson Oreta. They won their first ten games and ended up tied at first place in the standings with La Salle at 11–3. It was their second best start since winning 17 straight from the 1993–94 seasons. The Tigers' second-round game against Ateneo had to be stopped after the referees failed to control the players' physicality which resulted to a melee at the Cuneta Astrodome. UST was leading, 50–46 before the stoppage. The last quarter of the game was continued a week later in a closed door match at the Lyceum Gym. The Tigers ended up losing to Ateneo, 60–63. UST ended up tied with La Salle at first place at the end of the elimination rounds with 11 wins and 3 losses, but lost the playoff for the #1 seed against the Green Archers. They met Ateneo again in the Final Four and won, 75–74. The championship series went down to a deciding Game 3 and the Tigers had the chance to win in regulation, with a two-point lead. UST's Gilbert Lao was fouled with 15 seconds remaining and split his free throws for a 67–64 score. La Salle's Dino Aldeguer then converted a three-point shot to send the game into overtime. The Archers went on to win, 78–75.\n2000s.\nUST opened their 2000 season with a 54–65 loss to FEU, but bounced back with four straight wins. They then suffered back-to-back losses to end the first round with a 4–3 record in a tie for fourth place with UE. The team's inconsistency carried over to the second round and brought them the same fourth-place result at 8 wins and 6 losses for another tie with UE, who they defeated in the playoff for the fourth semifinal slot, 65–61. They once again lost to the #1 ranked La Salle in the Final Four, 62–65. The Tigers fell to a 0–11 scoring drought near the end of the first half for a 32–39 score. Derick Hubalde shot three straight three-pointers to come within three at 62–65 in the last 1:03 of the game. He was also able to force a La Salle turnover by stealing off Mon Jose, however, he failed to pass to the unguarded Cyrus Baguio and opted to take the shot himself. Hubalde missed a game-tying three to give La Salle the win and were again eliminated from the Finals for the third time since 1997.\nThe departure of key players caused the Growling Tigers to miss the Final Four for the first time in 2001 since the implementation of its format in 1993. Ortiguerra had already turned professional, while Baguio and Lao were all dropped from the roster due to academic deficiencies. They started the season on a 4-game losing streak and ended the first round in a tie with UP at sixth place with a 2–5 record. The Tigers' back-to-back wins over Adamson and the front-running Ateneo to start the second round gave the team a resurgence at the Final Four, but went on to lose crucial games against NU, La Salle and FEU. They ended the season at sixth place with 6 wins and 8 losses, topped by a 76–72 win over UE. Warren de Guzman was selected to the All-rookie team at the awarding ceremonies.\nWith Cyrus Baguio back in the lineup for the 2002 season, the Growling Tigers also made it back to the Final Four. UST qualified to the semifinals despite losing to the #2 seed UE on the last game of the eliminations to finish at fourth place with an 8–6 record. They lost to La Salle once again in the Final Four, but the season for the Tigers had been promising after finishing as runners-up in the Ambrosio Padilla Cup in the summer and as semifinalists in the Father Martin Cup. They also qualified to participate in the Collegiate Champions League in the postseason.\nAric del Rosario stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2003 season after the Growling Tigers finished in a tie for fifth place with a 5–9 record. They won their last game of the eliminations over UP in overtime, 92–89.\nNel Parado replaced Del Rosario as interim coach beginning in the postseason when UST participated in the 2003 PBL Platinum Cup. Their respectable showing in the tournament earned Parado a nod and a permanent tenure from the school's Institute of the Physical Education and Athletics. The Growling Tigers were off to a fair start in their 2004 UAAP campaign as they ended the first round tied at third place with La Salle and UE with a 4–3 record. UST, however failed to win a single game in the second round to finish the season at seventh place with a 4–10 record.\nThe Growling Tigers broke their 1989 record for their worst start when they went 0–5 to open the 2005 season. Their 12-game losing streak which began at the start of the second round of the previous season ended with their 107–100 overtime win over the winless NU Bulldogs. NU got back at UST with a 74–73 second round win for their first and only victory of the season. The Tigers ended the elimination rounds with the same 4–10 record from 2004, but on a higher rank at sixth place above Adamson and NU. The lone highlight of their campaign was when they stopped Ateneo's seven-game win streak in the second round by winning, 77–73. It was a turnaround for the team after placing third in the Father Martin Cup and winning the PRISAA tournament in the offseason. Jervy Cruz, who was a member of their training pool won the PRISAA MVP award. He was set to play his first year in the UAAP, but was pulled out of the roster due to academic deficiencies.\nWhen Parado's contract expired in February 2006, UST hired Pido Jarencio, their former star player who had made a name for himself in the Philippine Basketball Association. Jarencio, though, had no prior coaching experience which made critics question the school's decision to choose him as Parado's replacement. This observation was made evident when the Tigers went 2–4 in the first round of eliminations of the 2006 season. The teams had played one less game in each of the rounds with the absence of La Salle due to their suspension for the season. Things began to turn around for UST in their third game in the second round when they defeated the NU Bulldogs, 75–67 to end a four-game losing streak and improve their record to 3–5 to move to a tie for fourth place with Adamson and NU. The Tigers went on a three-game win streak, the last of which was an 88–80 overtime win over league-leading Ateneo to snap the Blue Eagles' undefeated record and avenge their 78–114 blowout loss in the first round. UST defeated Adamson, 77–74 in their last game of the eliminations to tie the Falcons at third place with a 6–6 record. They defeated Adamson again in the playoff for the #3 seed prior to the Final Four pairings. In defeating the second-seeded UE Red Warriors, the Growling Tigers became the fifth team in the UAAP Final Four era to advance to the Finals on a twice-to-beat disadvantage. They had reached the Finals for the first time since the 1999 playoff games. UST captured the UAAP title in three games after a 76–74 overtime win against Ateneo for their 18th championship in the league. Jojo Duncil was named Finals MVP, while Jarencio was hailed Coach of the Year. Jervy Cruz was earlier selected to the Mythical team during the ceremony for the individual awards.\nUST failed to defend their championship after they were eliminated in the 2007 playoffs. The Tigers, who ended up tied at fourth place with FEU at the end of eliminations with an 8–6 record, were looking to qualify to the stepladder semifinals after UE went undefeated and automatically qualified to the Finals. They defeated the Tamaraws in a playoff for the remaining semifinal slot where their opponents were limited to just six points in the second quarter. They then lost their knockout game to the third-seeded Ateneo Blue Eagles, 64–69 in the first round of the stepladder semifinals, signifying the end of their UAAP season. Jervy Cruz, who topped the statistical points tally was named season MVP.\nThe Tigers missed the playoffs for the fifth time in the last eight years when they ended the 2008 season at fifth place with a 6–8 record. Cruz was selected to the Mythical team for the third straight year.\nDespite winning only six games, the Growling Tigers had qualified to the Final Four after the NU Bulldogs defeated and eliminated La Salle at the end of the 2009 eliminations. UST finished the first round with 4 wins against 3 losses, but only managed to win two games in the second round. The Adamson Falcons had the same 4–3 record in the first round, but fared worse by winning only a single game in the next round. La Salle had a chance to overtake UST had they won over NU due to a superior +13 quotient over the Tigers. UST lost to defending champions Ateneo, 64–81 in their Final Four match. Team captain Dylan Ababou was named MVP and scoring leader of the season, while Jeric Teng won the Rookie of the year award.\n2010s.\nIn what was Jarencio's worst win–loss record as coach in the UAAP, the Growling Tigers ended their 2010 season at seventh place with a 4–10 record. UST placed fifth after the first round of eliminations with a 3–4 record, but were only able to secure a single win in the next round. Except for their opening game against the UE Red Warriors where they won by 13 points, the scores of the rest of their wins were from close-scoring matches, including their first round match against UP which went into overtime.\nThe Growling Tigers who celebrated their quadricentennial year in 2011 made it back to the Final Four after finishing the eliminations at fourth place with an 8–6 record. They were beaten anew by the four-peat seeking Ateneo Blue Eagles in their playoff game, 66–69. UST had trailed Ateneo by ten points in the last three minutes of the game, but were able to bring the lead down to three with five seconds remaining. Jeric Fortuna missed a three-point attempt to end the game in defeat.\nUST made it back to the Finals in 2012 after defeating the NU Bulldogs, who qualified to the Final Four for the first time in 11 years. The Tigers finished second at the end of eliminations with a 10–4 record, but were swept in their championship series by the Ateneo Blue Eagles, making their opponents five-peat champions of the tournament. Karim Abdul was selected to the Mythical team during the awarding ceremony for individual players. UST won the Philippine Collegiate Champions League title in the postseason after beating Ateneo in a three-game series. Jeric Teng was named tournament MVP.\nThe Growling Tigers reached the Finals again and faced the La Salle Green Archers for the first time since their 1999 championship series. Their 73-72 Game 1 win snapped the Archers' nine-game winning streak. La Salle went on to win the next two games to bag the 2013 championship. UST made it to the Finals when they defeated the NU Bulldogs in the Final Four with a twice-to-win disadvantage and became the first fourth-ranked team in UAAP history to eliminate the #1 seed in a playoff series.\nJarencio resigned in January 2014 after accepting an offer to coach in the PBA. His assistant Bong dela Cruz who was also a former Glowing Goldie was appointed as his replacement. With their key players falling to injuries and the unfamiliarity of a new system, the Growling Tigers failed to advance to the semifinals. They finished the season on a four-game losing streak to place sixth with a 5–9 record. Karim Abdul made it to the Mythical team for the third straight year. The team had a successful preseason with their runner-up finish in the Father Martin Cup in the summer.\nUST made it to the Finals for the third time in four years after defeating the 2014 champions, the NU Bulldogs in the Final Four. NU has been the Tigers' semifinal opponent for the third time in the last four years. The Growling Tigers became the fifth team in UAAP history to reach the Finals after missing the playoffs in the previous season. FEU defeated UST in three games to win their 20th championship and their first after a decade. The Tigers who were facing FEU in the finals for the first time since 1979 won both games against them in the eliminations. Kevin Ferrer and Ed Daquioag were selected to the Mythical team during the presentation of awards for Season 78.\nAnother former Glowing Goldie was tapped to be the new head coach of the Growling Tigers beginning in the 2016 season. Controversies hounded the team immediately after the 2015 season ended which prompted Dela Cruz to step down and be replaced by Boy Sablan, who was a teammate of Pido Jarencio in the 1980s. The ill-prepared Tigers who lost Ferrer, Daquioag and Abdul to graduation only managed to win three games to record their worst win–loss record in the Final Four era.\nThe Tigers sank further when they almost went winless in 2017. The team went on a 17-game losing streak that dated back from the second round of the previous season. Their lone win, which has become UST's worst record eclipsed their 2–12 season in 1989. Sablan was terminated at the end of the season.\nWhen champion coach Aldin Ayo announced his resignation from La Salle in December 2017, talks of his transfer to UST went abuzz. He eventually confirmed his appointment in January through a post on his social media account. During the elimination rounds, the Tigers' key players suffered injuries with Steve Akomo getting a concussion and CJ Cansino tearing his left ACL, causing both to bow out of the 2018 season. They were fourth in the standings at one point during the second round, but they lost all four of their remaining games to crash out of the Final Four and finish sixth with a 5–9 record.\nThe Growling Tigers overcame two semifinal do-or-die matches to reach the 2019 Finals against the undefeated Ateneo Blue Eagles. They ended the eliminations having the same 8–6 record of FEU, but were ranked lower at fourth place due to an inferior -6 quotient. They defeated the Tamaraws, 81–71 in a knockout match and then took down the second-seeded UP Fighting Maroons in two games in the second stage of the stepladder playoffs. They were then swept by Ateneo in their best-of-three championship series. Soulémane Chabi Yo was named season MVP, while Mark Nonoy won the Rookie of the Year award.\n2020s.\nWhen news broke out on August 20, 2020, that Cansino had been kicked out of the team, it was revealed that the Tigers had been staying in Sorsogon since June. Ayo resigned amid ongoing investigations by the school, the UAAP, the Commission on Higher Education, and the Games and Amusements Board on possible health protocols and quarantine violations that may have been committed by the group. Former Tigers team captain Jino Manansala was appointed interim coach in place of Ayo. In the aftermath, 12 of the 16 players from the 2019 team transferred to other schools, with Cansino going to UP, the trio of Rhenz Abando, Brent Paraiso and Ira Bataller to Letran, and Mark Nonoy and Deo Cuajao to La Salle. Tiger Cub center JB Lina withdrew his commitment to play for the Tigers' senior men's team and proceeded to enroll at UP.\nThe UAAP Board announced the cancellation of Season 83 on December 11, 2020. It marked the first time since World War II that an entire season is cancelled by the league. Season 82 was also cut short with the similar cancellation of the games in the second semester of the academic year due to the extended community quarantine from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe belatedly-run 84th season of the UAAP began in the second semester of the 2021–22 school year in March 2022, and even as training and preparations for the tournament had been ongoing since Manansala took over the team in October 2020, the composition of their roster could not immediately be finalized due to player transfers. Reigning MVP Soulémane Chabi Yo left the team in November 2021 after the announcement of the cancellation of Season 83. He decided to join a semi-professional team in the Liga EBA in Spain.\nThe 2021 squad won only three games and were riddled with blowout losses throughout the season, as they ended the tournament on a six-game losing streak. Their 50-point defeat at the hands of the Ateneo Blue Eagles, in particular, broke the league's record for the largest losing margin since record-keeping has been automated in 2003.\nManansala's assistant coaches, led by McJour Luib tendered their resignation at the end of the tournament. The futile efforts to reinstate former coach Aldin Ayo played a big role in the coaching staff's departure. Manansala, meanwhile, was reassigned to coach the school's high school program, as rumors of a corporate backer taking over team management began circulating around the sporting community.\nThe IPEA announced in July 2022 the appointment of former Growling Tiger and PBA player Bal David as the team's new head coach. With sporting events all around going back to normal, UST participated in the preseason tournaments by joining the PBA D-League and Filoil. Manansala and former Tiger Cubs coach Albert Alocillo served as interim coaches to the two tournaments as they were transitioning to a new system under David.\nEven as the Tigers fared well in the preseason, they were waylaid by the decommitment of their prized recruits. Fil-American Gani Stevens, who came along Minnesota teammate Willie Wilson in April 2022 made a surprise transfer to the UE Red Warriors' camp in August. Kean Baclaan, their high-scoring point guard, meanwhile decided to leave for the NU Bulldogs a few days after news on Stevens was reported. The team's lineup was further depleted after veterans Sherwin Concepcion and Bryan Santos were both ruled ineligible by the UAAP for having exceeded the league's age limit. With seven new players in the roster, the Tigers won only one game in the 2022 season. After winning their opening game against the Adamson Falcons, UST went on a 13-game losing streak to match their 2017 record for the fewest games won in the team's history. At the end of the elimination rounds, Nic Cabañero and Adama Faye led the league in scoring and rebounds with averages of 17.6 points and 12.2 rebounds per game respectively.\nThe Tigers' losing streak continued into their 2023 season, when they opened the first round of eliminations with six straight losses. Their 19 consecutive defeats has surpassed their worst record for the longest winning drought of 17 back in 2017. Their season ended early again after finishing with a 2–12 record. Faye, who was again the team's foreign student-athlete, played limited minutes in their opening game against UE and had to sit out after complaining of back pains. He left the roster midway in the season to fly back to his home country in Senegal.\nBal David earlier stepped down after only a six-month tenure, paving the way for Pido Jarencio's return as the Growling Tigers' head coach. With him came the long-awaited entry of one of Philippine basketball's corporate powerhouse, San Miguel Corporation as the team's main sponsor and backer.\nCabañero once again led the league in scoring with an average of 16.8 points per game. He was ranked 8th in the players' MVP tally with 60.1 statistical points at the end of the second round of eliminations.\nCoaches.\nThe Growling Tigers have had 20 coaches in around a century's existence of their basketball program. Pido Jarencio returned after a couple of coaching changes since Aldin Ayo's departure in the wake of the Sorsogon Bubble controversy. Jarencio resigned at the end of the 2013 season after leading the Tigers for eight years which resulted to one championship and two runner-up finishes.\nIn the team's history, five of their head coaches became coaches of the national team, and four went on to coach teams in the Philippine Basketball Association.\nHerr Silva and Aric del Rosario are the team's longest tenured coaches, each compiling 17 years in service. Silva's years at the helm of the Goldies were interwoven with Fely Fajardo's tenure in the 1950s and included a one-game stint as an interim coach in 1964 after Fajardo's abrupt resignation prior to the start of the UAAP season. He is also the school's winningest coach with nine championships, the first of which were six straight titles from 1939 until 1949 (interrupted by the war), and then a three-peat from 1951 to 1953. Del Rosario was promoted head coach in 1985 following a stint with UST's junior basketball program. He stepped down after three years following a controversy involving one of his players' eligibility. He came back in 1990 and led the Tigers to a four-year championship run, the first of which was an undefeated 1993 campaign.\nSilva was also enshrined to the PSC's Philippine Sports Hall of Fame in 2010 as coach of the 1954 national team that competed in the Brazil World Championship. Chito Calvo was included in the fourth batch of inductees in 2021. He was also enshrined to the FIBA Hall of Fame as a contributor to the sport in 2007. Both coaches were honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the National Basketball Hall of Fame Foundation in 1999.\nNotable players.\nRetired jerseys.\nChris Cantonjos' jersey No. 15 has been retired in recognition of his contributions to the team's four-peat championship that includes an undefeated season in 1993, as well as for being named MVP and a two-time member of the Mythical team. The No. 15, however, remains in circulation and has since been used by the following players:\nJino Manansala had used the No. 15 during his rookie year in 1999 before settling for the No. 11 in 2001.\nControversies.\nIn the early part of the 2016, the Growling Tigers management investigated UST head coach Bong dela Cruz for the alleged involvement in game-fixing. A report from sports news website Fastbreak states from a source that the management disbanded the men's basketball team due to game-fixing and sell-out games allegations.\nAnother report from Spin.ph notes that Dela Cruz accused for maltreatment and abusive incidents against some of the players, particularly players from Team B, during his two-year term as a coach. Sooner, the media has yet to confirm the statement regarding the issue on Dela Cruz.\nDela Cruz, later in a statement released on February 1, 2016, said that since the issues emerged, he decided to keep quiet about it. He denies the allegations against him and is confident that he will be proven innocent of the issues against him.\nIn 2017–2018 season, two players named Mario Bonleon and Renzo Subido decided not to play with UST under Sablan for different reasons, the team standing of the senior's basketball is one of the worst in the history of the UST Growling Tigers at 1 win and 13 losses. Because of that standing, Sablan and the entire coaching staff were sacked by no other than the Rector of the UST effective November 30, 2017, terminating their contracts which will be expiring in August 2018. UST Tigresses Assistant Coach Arsenio Dysangco Jr. was appointed as overseer during practices."

As a freshman, he had a 5–3 win–loss record with a 5.43 earned run average (ERA) and 55 strikeouts in 53 innings pitched. As a sophomore, Barnes had an 8–3 record with a 3.92 ERA and 75 strikeouts. In his junior season, Barnes had an 11–3 win–loss record and an 1.11 ERA with 97 strikeouts in fourteen games started during the regular season, as the Huskies won their first conference regular season title.\nBarnes was twice named to the All-Big East team.

In a total of 25 games (all starts) he had a 6–10 record with a 4.13 ERA and 142 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nBarnes spent most of the 2014 season with Triple-A Pawtucket, where he appeared in 23 games (22 starts) compiling an 8–9 record with a 3.95 ERA and 103 strikeouts in innings pitched.\n2014–2018.\nThe Red Sox promoted Barnes to the major leagues for the first time on September 8. He made his MLB debut the next day, pitching three scoreless innings of relief in a 4–1 Boston loss to the Baltimore Orioles. He finished the rest of the season with Boston, making a total of five MLB appearances (all in relief) while giving up four runs in nine innings pitched (4.00 ERA).\nBarnes split time in 2015 between Pawtucket and Boston. In Triple-A, he compiled a 1–1 record with a 4.06 ERA in 17 games (five starts) with 41 strikeouts in innings pitched. He made a total of 32 MLB appearances (two starts), pitching 43 innings while recording 39 strikeouts with a 5.44 ERA and a 3–4 record. Barnes spent all of the 2016 season with Boston, appearing in 62 games (all in relief) with 4.05 ERA and 71 strikeouts in innings pitched. Along with a 4–3 record, he had his first save, which came on August 9 when he recorded the final out of a 5–3 win over the New York Yankees by striking out Mark Teixeira. During the 2016 ALDS, Barnes made his postseason debut, pitching innings in Game 2 against the Cleveland Indians; he gave up three hits and one unearned run.\nEarly in the 2017 season, Barnes was ejected for the first time in his MLB career, on April 23 by umpire Andy Fletcher, for apparently trying to hit Baltimore's Manny Machado with a pitch in response to a hard slide by Machado on Dustin Pedroia in a game two days prior. The next day, Barnes received a four-game suspension for \"intentionally throwing a pitch in the area of the head of Manny Machado.\" For the 2017 season, Barnes made 70 relief appearances with Boston, compiling a 7–3 record, plus one save, with a 3.88 ERA and 83 strikeouts in innings pitched. Barnes started the 2018 season in his usual role as a member of Boston's bullpen.

He appeared in 70 games, recording a 5–4 record with four saves, a 3.78 ERA, and 110 strikeouts in innings. During the start-delayed 2020 season, Barnes was the team's \"de facto\" closer after Brandon Workman was traded. Overall with the 2020 Red Sox, Barnes appeared in 24 games, all in relief, compiling a 1–3 record with 9 saves, 4.70 ERA, and 31 strikeouts in 23 innings pitched.\nIn early December 2020, Barnes and the Red Sox reached a one-year deal for the 2021 season, worth a reported $4.5 million. In late March 2021, Barnes tested positive for COVID-19, although it was subsequently announced that the result was a false positive. Barnes began the season as the team's closer, recording six saves in the first month of the season and being named the American League Reliever of the Month for April. On July 4, he was named to the American League roster for the MLB All-Star Game. On July 11, the Red Sox reached an agreement with Barnes on a two-year contract extension, including a team option for the 2024 season. Barnes was on the COVID-related injured list for one day in early August. He later tested positive at the end of the month, and did not return to the team until September 17. Barnes struggled in the second half of the season, and eventually lost his role as the closer before the end of the season. As a result of his struggles, Barnes was left off the initial ALDS and ALCS rosters for the Red Sox, although he was added onto the ALDS roster after an injury to Garrett Richards. It was later revealed that Barnes had cut off the tip of the thumb on his left (non-throwing) hand with a knife while cooking, which contributed to his late season struggles. Overall during the 2021 regular season, Barnes made 60 appearances, all in relief, with a 3.79 ERA while registering 24 saves and striking out 84 batters in innings.\nBarnes returned to the Red Sox bullpen for the 2022 season.

In 44 games with the Red Sox during 2022, Barnes accrued a 4.31 ERA with an 0–4 record and 8 saves, while striking out 34 batters in innings.\nOn January 24, 2023, Barnes was designated for assignment by the Red Sox, to clear roster space for Adam Duvall.\nMiami Marlins.\nBarnes was traded to the Miami Marlins on January 30, 2023, in exchange for relief pitcher Richard Bleier. In 24 appearances for Miami, Barnes posted a 5.48 ERA with 20 strikeouts in innings pitched. On July 14, it was announced that Barnes would undergo femoral acetabular impingement surgery on his left hip, and likely miss the remainder of the season. He became a free agent following the season.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn February 27, 2024, Barnes signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals that included an invitation to spring training. On March 24, the Nationals selected Barnes' contract.\nPersonal life.\nBarnes began holding an annual baseball clinic at the Newtown, Connecticut, Youth Academy for elementary school students in December 2013. Barnes was married in January 2019 to Chelsea Barnes."

        "title": "WrestleMania 32",
        "text": "WrestleMania 32 was the 32nd annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on April 3, 2016, at the AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. This was the last WrestleMania to be held before the reintroduction of the brand extension in July, which introduced another world championship, the WWE Universal Championship, thus it was also the last WrestleMania to feature one world championship. It was also the third WrestleMania to be held in the state of Texas (after X-Seven and XXV).\nTwelve matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. Four matches were particularly considered to be the marquee attractions. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Triple H to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches, The Undertaker defeated Shane McMahon in a Hell in a Cell match, Brock Lesnar defeated Dean Ambrose in a No Holds Barred Street Fight, and Charlotte defeated Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks to win the inaugural WWE Women's Championship, which replaced the WWE Divas Championship that Charlotte held going into the event and had been retired during the Kickoff show. The event was also notable for having the shortest WrestleMania match ever, when The Rock defeated Erick Rowan in an impromptu match. The André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal included the surprise participation of former National Basketball Association player Shaquille O'Neal; the match was won by NXT's Baron Corbin in his main roster debut.\nAccording to WWE, WrestleMania 32 set multiple records for the company, including grossing $17.3 million and a claimed attendance record of 101,763. However, independent reports listed an attendance of 80,709, making it the third most attended wrestling event in the history of the medium. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon later admitted the attendance record \"wasn't 101,000 paid\" as it included \"ushers and ticket takers and all of that\".\nDespite its commercial success, critics gave mixed to negative reviews for WrestleMania 32, and rated it worse than the event WWE held two days prior. Praise went towards the opening ladder match, Styles vs. Jericho, and the Women's Championship match; criticism was focused on the main event, Ambrose vs. Lesnar, the Hell in a Cell match, the overall length of the event, and what were seen as questionable booking decisions, which were focused on the amount of heel victories outside of the opening match and main event. The show was voted as the \"Worst Major Wrestling Show\" of 2016 in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Awards, and readers of WrestleCrap, which chronicles the worst moments in professional wrestling, gave it the Gooker Award for the worst wrestling event of any kind in 2016. The main event title match drew particular criticism and resulted in negative and angry crowd reactions.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host each year's edition of WrestleMania. As part of bidding process., Texas offered WWE $2.7 million in subsidies.\nAnnounced on January 20, 2015, WrestleMania 32 was scheduled to be held on April 3, 2016, at the AT&amp;T Stadium in the Dallas suburb of Arlington, Texas. It was the third WrestleMania to be held in the state of Texas (following X-Seven and XXV) and the first to take place in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex area. It was also the second to be held in a FIFA World Cup stadium since the Pontiac Silverdome (WrestleMania III) as it is one of the venues hosting matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Tickets went on sale on November 6, 2015, with individual tickets costing $18 to $2,360. On October 13, 2015, traveling packages with accommodation ranging from $575 to $6,625 per person were sold. Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that WrestleMania 32 broke the WWE's record for most tickets sold with at least 84,000 tickets sold.\nJesse Lawrence of \"Forbes\" speculated that WrestleMania 32 could break the WWE attendance record of 93,173 set at WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. This record stood as the highest attendance for any indoor event until the 2010 NBA All-Star Game, also held at AT&amp;T Stadium, drew 108,713. However, Dave Meltzer reported that the actual WWE attendance record before WrestleMania 32 was the 1992 SummerSlam's 79,127, and that WrestleMania III's actual attendance was around 78,000.\nThe five official theme songs for the event were \"My House\" (by Flo Rida), \"Hello Friday\" (by Flo Rida featuring Jason Derulo), \"Hail to the King\" (by Avenged Sevenfold), \"Sympathy for the Devil\" (by Motörhead), and \"Oh No\" (by Goodbye June). On March 21, 2016, it was announced that the American girl group Fifth Harmony would be performing \"America the Beautiful\" during the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show.\nWWE had been hobbled by real-life injuries to the wrestlers on its roster, rendering them unable to wrestle at WrestleMania 32. The injured list at the time included John Cena, Seth Rollins, Randy Orton, Cesaro, Neville, and Luke Harper. Meanwhile, Sting, Nikki Bella, and Tyson Kidd suffered neck injuries, with Kidd barely avoiding paralysis or death and Sting being forced to retire. Daniel Bryan was also forced to retire due to severe concussions. David Shoemaker, writing for \"ESPN\", described that \"it seems as if the talent left off the match lineup could sell more tickets than the one currently on it.\" Shoemaker also theorized possible reasons for injuries being firstly \"WWE's grueling schedule\", and secondly \"the travel, the exhaustion, the lack of an offseason\".\nIn March 2016, Daniel Van Doom of \"CNET\" wrote that WrestleMania 32 would see the culmination of \"the biggest story in WWE\", which is \"establishing Roman Reigns as the top babyface\". WWE's attempts to get Reigns the \"level of recognition\" of name like Hulk Hogan, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, The Rock, and John Cena met its \"toughest opponent\" in the wrestling audience which started a \"fan rebellion\" in opposition to WWE's support of Reigns, with fans preferring Dean Ambrose instead. \"COED\" agreed that Reigns, whom WWE thought \"has the most star power and wide-spread appeal\", was \"being feverishly rejected\" with boos by WWE's audience. To combat this trend, WWE has taken measures including muting booing crowds and piping in canned cheers during Reigns's appearances in 2016. Kyle Fowle of \"The A.V. Club\" commented that \"WWE has a serious Roman Reigns problem\", due to \"basically nobody wanting to see Roman Reigns in the main event\" of WrestleMania.\nCelebrity involvement.\nAs is tradition at WrestleMania, the show included appearances by numerous celebrity guests. Fifth Harmony, who performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the start of WrestleMania 32, Maria Menounos served as a backstage interviewer, and Snoop Dogg – who the night before was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame – performed a live version for his cousin Sasha Banks' entrance theme as he accompanied her to the ring for her match.\nJoan Lunden was recognized as part of the 2016's WWE Hall of Fame class, as she won the Warrior Award for her public battle with breast cancer. NBA great Shaquille O'Neal was a surprise participant in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, eliminating Damien Sandow and having a standoff with fellow seven-footer Big Show before both of these two were eliminated by about ten other wrestlers, before Baron Corbin eliminated Kane to win the battle royal. The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders also made an appearance as part of The Rock's entrance to the ring.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 12 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe storylines leading into WrestleMania 32 were not received well by critics. Jason Powell of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" lamented that \"the build to WrestleMania has been a creative mess\", and that WWE's injury-hit roster does not excuse \"sloppy booking or storylines with massive holes and logic gaps\". Josh Hamlin of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" criticized, \"There is no momentum for WrestleMania at all. The event sells itself purely on its brand name\". Ben Tucker of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" wrote, \"Not since WrestleMania 13 has WWE's Super Bowl come together in such a bizarre fashion, with WWE making some of the most head-scratching decisions I've seen in ages\". Kyle Fowle of \"The A.V. Club\" declared that WWE's \"ship is headed straight for the rocks\", and in particular \"the WWE World Heavyweight Championship feud is a disaster\".\nMain event match.\nAt Survivor Series, Roman Reigns won a tournament for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship. Reigns had earlier refused offers by Triple H to join The Authority, which would have automatically placed him in the tournament finals, but Reigns fought in the whole tournament and after his victory, he speared Triple H, who tried to congratulate him. Sheamus then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract after a Brogue Kick and won the title. At , Reigns faced Sheamus in a TLC match, but lost when Alberto Del Rio and Rusev interfered. Post-match, Reigns attacked Sheamus, Del Rio, Rusev, and then Triple H with a chair. The next night on \"Raw\", Reigns regained the title from Sheamus in a title vs. career match. Vince McMahon then forced Reigns to defend the title in the annual 30-man Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble with Reigns entering at #1. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H returned as the #30 entrant and eliminated Reigns en route to winning the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At Fastlane, Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose and Brock Lesnar in a triple threat match to face Triple H for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania. The following night on \"Raw\", Triple H attacked Reigns during the latter's match against Sheamus and beat a bloodied Reigns and executed a Pedigree on Reigns onto the steel steps. However, Reigns returned on the March 14 episode of \"Raw\" and assaulted Triple H.\nUndercard matches.\nOn the February 22 episode of \"Raw\", Mr. McMahon presented the \"Vincent J. McMahon Legacy of Excellence\" Award to his daughter Stephanie McMahon. As Stephanie was about to do the acceptance speech about the award given to her, Shane McMahon returned to WWE for the first time since 2009, to confront his father and sister in regards to his role in the company. Vince then made a deal with Shane that he would gain control of \"Raw\" if he could win a match of his choosing but would relinquish a lockbox of Vince's secrets if he lost. After Shane accepted, Vince named The Undertaker as his opponent and made the match a Hell in a Cell match; Shane's last match was in May 2009. The following week, Undertaker returned to \"Raw\" and said that Shane's blood would be on Vince's hands, not his. Vince stated that if The Undertaker did not win, it would be his last WrestleMania.\nDuring the closing moments of the triple threat match at Fastlane, Brock Lesnar applied the kimura lock on Roman Reigns, only for Dean Ambrose to attack Lesnar with a chair at the last minute; this incapacitated Lesnar long enough for Reigns to defeat Ambrose. The next day before \"Raw\" aired, Lesnar attacked Ambrose and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. On \"Raw\", Paul Heyman issued a challenge to anyone on the roster to face Lesnar at WrestleMania. Ambrose returned in the ambulance to challenge Lesnar to a No Holds Barred Street Fight; Heyman accepted on Lesnar's behalf. On the March 14 episode of \"Raw\", hardcore legend Mick Foley gave Ambrose his signature barbed wire baseball bat. The next week on \"Raw\", another hardcore legend, Terry Funk, gave Ambrose a chainsaw.\nAfter controversially defeating Becky Lynch at the Royal Rumble to retain the WWE Divas Championship, Charlotte was ambushed by a returning Sasha Banks. On the February 29 episode of \"Raw\", Lynch and Banks fought in a No. 1 Contender's match, but the match ended in a double pin. A rematch on the next episode of \"SmackDown\" ended in a no contest when Charlotte attacked both women. Subsequently, Charlotte was scheduled to defend her title against both women in a triple threat match at WrestleMania.\nOn the February 8 episode of \"Raw\", after defeating The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E) and Mark Henry in a tag team tables match, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) turned heel and betrayed their teammates The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso). Explaining that they did not come back to WWE to be a \"nostalgia act\" and reminding the fans that they are \"the baddest tag team on the planet\", The Dudley Boyz abandoned using their trademark tables. In the following weeks, The Usos saved wrestlers from post-match beatdowns by The Dudley Boyz, setting up a tag team match between the two teams for the event. The match was later moved to the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show.\nDuring the \"'Cutting Edge Peep Show\" at Fastlane, WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, and Big E) showed signs of a face turn by mocking The League of Nations (Sheamus, King Barrett, Alberto Del Rio, and Rusev). Over the next few weeks, The New Day continued to mock The League of Nations in backstage segments. At Roadblock, The New Day retained the WWE Tag Team Championship against League of Nations members Sheamus and King Barrett. The New Day then defeated fellow League of Nations members Del Rio and Rusev the following night on \"Raw\" to retain the championships, causing The League of Nations to attack The New Day during the post-match and turning The New Day face, leading to a six-man tag team match between Sheamus, Del Rio, and Rusev and The New Day at WrestleMania.\nAfter walking out on Big Show and Kane during their six-man tag team rematch against The Wyatt Family, causing them to lose, on the February 22 episode of \"Raw\", Ryback became more aggressive by defeating his opponents in squash matches. On March 14 episode of \"Raw\", after defeating Sin Cara, Ryback challenged United States Champion Kalisto to a match for the United States Championship at WrestleMania, which Kalisto accepted two days later in an interview with Michael Cole. The match was later moved to the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show.\nAfter weeks of feuding between each other, The Miz, Dolph Ziggler, and Sami Zayn confronted Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens on the March 21 episode of \"Raw\" and challenged him for the title. Owens agreed to talk to The Authority about setting up a number one contender triple threat match for a shot at his title, but the match instead included Zack Ryder, Sin Cara, and Stardust. Miz, Ziggler, and Zayn all interfered in the match, which ended in no contest. Stephanie McMahon then set up a ladder match for the title at WrestleMania, with Owens defending the title against all six competitors.\nAfter AJ Styles defeated Chris Jericho at Fastlane, both men in respect and formed a tag team known as \"Y2AJ\" and dominated the tag team division by defeating champions The New Day in two consecutive matches, leading to Y2AJ challenging them to a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. However, Y2AJ failed to win the championships against The New Day on March 7 episode of \"Raw\" after Jericho was pinned by Big E. After the match, Jericho attacked Styles with three Codebreakers, turning heel in the process. Jericho stated that he was tired of the fans chanting for Styles and not him. Styles then challenged Jericho to a match at WrestleMania which Jericho refused, stating he would rather sit with the crowd at WrestleMania rather than face him. On the March 28 episode of \"Raw\", during Jericho's match with Zack Ryder, Styles distracted Jericho, causing Ryder to beat Jericho. Then, Jericho accepted Styles's challenge.\nOn the March 14 episode of \"Raw\", Lana allied with Team B.A.D. (Naomi and Tamina) by helping them defeat Brie Bella and Alicia Fox. Lana then attacked Paige after the latter's victory over Summer Rae two days later on \"Main Event\". On the following episode of \"Main Event\", during a match between Paige and Naomi, Rae and Emma attacked Fox and Natalya (in Paige's corner at ringside), allowing Naomi to win. On the March 28 episode of \"Raw\", Emma (accompanied by Naomi, Tamina, Lana, and Rae) defeated Paige (accompanied by Brie, Fox, and Natalya). Following the match, Eva Marie allied with Brie, Paige, Fox, and Natalya. Subsequently, a ten-woman tag team match between the two teams was scheduled for the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the two-hour long WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, which was broadcast on the WWE Network, WWE.com, Facebook, Google+, Pinterest, and YouTube, with USA Network joining the live coverage for the second hour. In the first match, Kalisto defended the United States Championship against Ryback. Kalisto won after executing a Salida Del Sol on Ryback, who had collided with an exposed turnbuckle.\nIn the second match, a 10-women tag team match pitted Team Total Divas (Alicia Fox, Brie Bella, Eva Marie, Natalya, and Paige) against Team B.A.D. &amp; Blonde (Emma, Lana, Naomi, Summer Rae, and Tamina). Bella won the match for Team Total Divas by making Naomi submit to the Yes! Lock. Nikki Bella, who was inactive due to a neck injury, came out to celebrate with her sister and the rest of the team.\nNext, WWE Hall of Famer Lita introduced a new WWE Women's Championship to replace the WWE Divas Championship, and revealed that the winner of the triple threat match between Charlotte, Becky Lynch, and Sasha Banks later that night would be awarded the title.\nFinally, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team match after The Usos performed a double Superkick on D-Von. After the match, The Usos performed Samoan Splashes through tables on The Dudley Boyz.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, with Stardust, Zack Ryder, Kevin Owens, Sami Zayn, Sin Cara, The Miz, and Dolph Ziggler as the participants. Stardust used a black ladder with yellow polka dots to tribute his late father Dusty Rhodes, but that ladder was disposed of by Owens. Mid-match, Ziggler executed a series of superkicks, while Ryder performed an elbow drop off a ladder onto The Miz. In the climax, Owens powerbombed Ziggler off a ladder, then caused Sin Cara to fall off a ladder onto Stardust, who was lying on a ladder bridged between the ring apron and barricade. Owen's rival Zayn took out Owens with a half and half suplex onto a ladder and was in turn incapacitated by the Miz. Premature celebrations by the Miz allowed Ryder to shove him off a ladder and retrieve the belt to win the match. Post-match, Ryder's father joined Ryder in the ring for a celebration.\nNext, Chris Jericho took on AJ Styles. After an evenly contested match (which saw Styles kick out of Jericho's Codebreaker, and Jericho kick out of Styles's Styles Clash), Jericho hid behind the referee and countered Styles's Phenomenal Forearm into a mid-air Codebreaker to win the match.\nAfter that, WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), who entered by coming out of a huge \"Booty-O's\" cereal box (while wearing \"Dragon Ball Z\"-inspired attire, with Woods's outfit modeled after Vegeta), then wrestled The League of Nations (Sheamus, Alberto Del Rio, and Rusev) in a six-man tag team match, with League teammate King Barrett at ringside. The League of Nations won the match following a Bull Hammer by Barrett to Woods when the referee was distracted and a Brogue Kick by Sheamus on Woods. After the match, Barrett bragged that no three men could beat the League of Nations. WWE Hall of Famers Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley, and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, then came down and cleared the ring of The League of Nations. Austin then performed a Stunner on Woods, who had tried to persuade the Hall of Famers to dance with him.\nNext was the No Holds Barred Street Fight between Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) and Dean Ambrose. Lesnar executed thirteen suplexes on Ambrose, while Ambrose used kendo sticks and chairs to try to keep Lesnar down. Ambrose also attempted to use a chainsaw, which did not start. After Ambrose threw numerous chairs in the ring, Lesnar attempted an F-5, only for Ambrose to counter and execute Dirty Deeds on Lesnar onto the pile of chairs for a near fall. In the end, Ambrose brought in a barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat to finish Lesnar off, however, Lesnar delivered a German suplex and an F-5 on Ambrose on the pile of chairs to win the match. Afterwards, Lesnar sprayed Ambrose with a fire extinguisher.\nAfter the 2016 WWE Hall of Fame class had been presented, Charlotte, Becky Lynch, and Sasha Banks (who had her cousin and newly-minted WWE Hall of Famer Snoop Dogg perform her entrance theme while accompanying her to the ring) wrestled in a Triple Threat match. Originally promoted as being for Charlotte's WWE Divas Championship, the match would instead determine the new WWE Women's Champion as the Divas title would be retired. During the match, Charlotte applied the Figure-four leglock on Lynch. Banks broke it up with a Frog Splash and pinned Charlotte, who kicked out. Later, Banks performed a suicide dive on Charlotte. As Banks taunted Ric Flair (Charlotte's father and manager), Lynch took him out. Charlotte then performed a top-rope moonsault on Lynch and Banks. Back in the ring, Charlotte performed Natural Selection on Banks and Lynch at the same time, but both kicked out. Afterwards, Lynch, Banks, and Charlotte applied their respective submissions, only for the other to break it up. In the climax, Lynch performed an Exploder suplex from the top rope on Charlotte, who rolled out of the ring. Banks then applied the Bank Statement on Lynch, but Charlotte threw Banks out of the ring. Charlotte then applied the Figure-Eight Leglock on Lynch while Ric prevented Banks from intervening. Lynch submitted, giving the win and the WWE Women's title to Charlotte.\nThe Hell in a Cell match between The Undertaker and Shane McMahon was next. If Shane won, he would get control of \"Raw\", while Undertaker would be banned from wrestling at future WrestleManias. Undertaker dominated the start of the match and executed a Last Ride powerbomb on McMahon for a near-fall. McMahon fought back and eventually gained the advantage by reversing Hell's Gate into a Sharpshooter. McMahon then placed a garbage can in front of Undertaker's chest and performed a Coast-to-Coast for a near-fall. Undertaker tackled McMahon through the side of the cell, and the two fought on the floor around ringside. After Undertaker countered a Sleeper Hold by slamming McMahon through a broadcast table, McMahon struck Undertaker with TV monitors and a metal toolbox to keep him down and placed him across another broadcast table. McMahon then climbed to the top of the cell and attempted the Leap of Faith onto Undertaker, who moved, causing McMahon to fall through the broadcast table. Though McMahon motioned for Undertaker to \"bring it\", he had no strength left to fight. Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver to win the match. McMahon was taken out of the stadium on a stretcher (while showing a thumbs-up to the crowd) while Undertaker walked and smiled.\nNext was the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal which saw several surprise entrants in the match, including legends Diamond Dallas Page and Tatanka, NXT call-up Baron Corbin making his main roster debut and former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal as a celebrity entry. Both O'Neal and Big Show performed a double chokeslam on Kane to start and the other wrestlers were then thrown aside (though not eliminated) by O'Neal and Show. After Fandango and Damien Sandow were eliminated by Show and O'Neal respectively, O'Neal and Show fought to the ropes, where the other participants eliminated them both. In the end, Corbin won the match by last eliminating Kane.\nThe Rock then made a grand entrance, which included the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders and Rock using a flamethrower to set a big sign bearing his name ablaze. Rock announced that WrestleMania 32 had set the all-time attendance record with 101,763, when he was confronted by The Wyatt Family (Erick Rowan, Bray Wyatt, and Braun Strowman). After some verbal back-and-forth, The Rock (who had his ring gear on underneath his street clothes) challenged them to a match. Rowan accepted the challenge and was quickly defeated following a Rock Bottom. WWE recognized the match length as six seconds, though other sources reported seven seconds. This set a new WrestleMania record for the shortest match, besting the previous record (11 seconds) set by Kane and Chavo Guererro's match at WrestleMania XXIV. Enraged by this quick victory, the entire Wyatt Family then surrounded the Rock when surprisingly, John Cena emerged and helped Rock clear the ring of the Wyatts. The segment ended when Rock and Cena walked up the ramp and Rock hugged his family before raising Cena's arm. The Rock's match against Erick Rowan proved to be his last wrestling match until he returned in 2024, where he will be wrestling alongside Roman Reigns against Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Triple H (accompanied by Stephanie McMahon) defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns. After Reigns took control of the match, Stephanie distracted the referee, allowing Triple H to execute a low blow and target Reigns's nose. Reigns performed a Spear through the barricade on Triple H. Triple H began to target Reigns's arm but Reigns recovered and executed another Spear, only for Stephanie to pull the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. Stephanie argued with the referee and was inadvertently struck by a Spear from Reigns. Triple H executed a Pedigree on Reigns for a near-fall. Stephanie then handed Triple H his trademark sledgehammer but the referee warned him that he'd be disqualified if he used it (although he would retain the WWE Championship). In the end, Reigns executed two Superman Punches on Triple H, dodged a sledgehammer shot and executed the third spear to regain the championship for a third time. A wide array of celebratory fireworks was released.\nReception.\nAs predicted by multiple critics before the event, Reigns (despite playing a heroic character) was booed by the WrestleMania crowd during the main event and as the show went off the air with him as champion, with the result drawing angry reactions. To placate the angry crowd, WWE had Triple H play to the crowd after broadcasting had concluded. The main event also saw the uninterested crowd chanting for various wrestlers uninvolved in the match or storyline: Sami Zayn, Bayley, and Shinsuke Nakamura. Several reports emerged of WWE muting the crowd microphones at WrestleMania during and after the main event when Reigns was being booed.\nReportedly, some attendees were unhappy about the entrance into AT&amp;T Stadium, which they described as long and messy. On the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", also held in Dallas but a day later, Vince McMahon asked the live crowd what they thought of WrestleMania 32. The crowd responded by booing and then booed even louder when Vince mentioned Reigns as the new world champion.\nAttendance and revenue.\nOn the day of the event, WWE claimed an attendance of 101,763 in the AT&amp;T Stadium, which surpassed the previous WWE-claimed record of 93,173 for WrestleMania III in 1987. Also, WWE reported the event grossing $17.3 million for WWE's highest-grossing live event, and surpassing the previous year's $12.6 million. However, journalist Dave Meltzer initially reported 93,730 as \"the attendance as would be normally announced for an event\" with a total 97,769 people in the stadium if one includes stadium personnel, WWE personnel, etc. Meltzer attributed the exaggeration due to WWE not wanting to let down their fans after WWE's promoting \"from the start of drawing 100,000 people\" to WrestleMania 32. The 93,730 figure would still be WWE's highest attended event, as according to Meltzer the previous record was the 1992 SummerSlam event at 79,127, while WrestleMania III did \"more than 78,000\". Meanwhile, Meltzer endorsed the grossing figure as \"either accurate or very close\". Meltzer would later clarify the actual fan attendance as being 80,709; this figure was also supported by \"Fightful\" who were provided the turnstile count by the Arlington Police Department.\nIn a conference call in February 2017, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon said, \"We were proud to set our attendance record of over 100,000, which includes, by the way, ushers and ticket takers and all of that. It wasn't 101,000 paid, but nonetheless, it was a record for us.\"\nReviews.\nWrestleMania 32 received generally mixed to negative reactions from critics, who criticized the event for its length and questionable booking decisions. Some critics and fans would even consider this one of the worst WrestleManias of all time. Critics who reviewed both WrestleMania 32 and WWE's event which occurred two days earlier concluded that the NXT event was a greatly superior \"professional wrestling show\" despite WrestleMania having more \"spectacle\"; NXT's match of (the debuting) Shinsuke Nakamura versus Sami Zayn in particular was praised as better than any moment or match from WrestleMania 32.\nTroy L. Smith of \"cleveland.com\" wrote that \"WrestleMania 32 was a night that defied low expectations, thanks in large part a ton of WWE nostalgia\", but added that \"some of that early goodwill was squandered by odd booking decisions\". Smith felt that the HHH-Reigns main event was \"extremely boring – one of the worst main events ever at WrestleMania\", with the ending saw \"WWE found itself stuck in a moment it couldn't get out of with more boos than cheers\". Ultimately, Smith concluded that \"WrestleMania 32 proves Zack Ryder (or anyone) is better than Roman Reigns\".\nPaul Tamburro of \"CraveOnline\" wrote that the show was characterized by \"inexplicable booking decisions that actively undermined all storyline progression\", adding that \"WWE routinely swerved its fans with finishes to matches that were less exciting than what had been expected\". He decried the HHH-Reigns main event as a \"dull, slow-paced match\" and described Reigns's babyface push as \"absurd\" and \"an embarrassing failed experiment for the company\", with \"the crowd still being given no reason to feel anything for the guy outside of sheer ambivalence or venomous hatred\". Tamburro was also critical of the Shane McMahon–Undertaker match, which he described as \"thoroughly pointless\", and of the booking of Dean Ambrose, writing that \"him losing to Lesnar in such a disappointing manner puts a big dent in his value\". He had further criticism for the company's over-reliance on past stars, writing that \"while the implementation of these big names was a lot of fun, it still happened to the detriment of talent currently on the roster\". In contrast, Tamburro praised the Women's Championship match, calling it \"triumphant\", and described Zack Ryder's unexpected win as \"the feel-good moment of the show\".\nJames Caldwell of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" described the event as a \"weird show\". He rated the HHH-Reigns match 1.5 stars out of 5, questioning why \"anyone wanted to sit through this long of a main event and criticizing \"the egos of the McMahon family\" for booking the match. Caldwell went on to describe Reigns as \"a pet project that would be laughed out of this spot in any other era\". Caldwell chose not to rate the Hell in a Cell match, describing it as a \"weird deal\" with \"Shane McMahon, a non-wrestler against Undertaker in one of Taker’s last WrestleMania matches\". The women's title match was rated 3 stars, \"strong\" other than the finish, which puzzled Caldwell when apparently \"Mania isn't a big enough event to pay off Flair's repeated interference with the face(s) conquering\".\nNolan Howell of \"Canoe Sports\" described the show as \"absurdly bizarre. Strange booking decisions and nothing seemed to be resolved at all, aside from the impromptu Shane vs. Undertaker story which could have been tied up any time\". Howell wrote that while \"the match quality was fine\", the show was \"spectacle without a lot of substance\". He described the second half of the show as a \"train wreck creatively\", adding that \"WWE just can't do anything right really\". Howell noted that when Reigns won the main event, \"the crowd mics [were] suspiciously not picking up too much noise for the second or third time during\" that match. Lastly, Howell described the Women's Championship match as the match of the night.\nDave Scherer of \"Pro Wrestling Insider\" commented on responses that WrestleMania 32 was \"great\", countering that \"unless you are putting the framework in place for the future, you will reach a point where most of your assets are gone and you will be in a barren place\". This was referencing that \"the finishes and character development (or lack thereof)\" resulting in older stars (Rock, Austin, Foley, Michaels and Jericho) shining at the expense of newer talent (Styles, The New Day, The League of Nations, and The Wyatt Family). Scherer also criticized Vince McMahon for ignoring the \"clear edict\" from fans against Roman Reigns as world champion.\nScott Keith of \"Sporting News\" wrote that WrestleMania 32 \"ended up being a five-hour slog (seven hours with the pregame show) and one of the worst WrestleManias when all was said and done\". He wrote that \"Roman Reigns showed once again that he's not the guy to be the top star despite Triple H's best efforts to get a 'classic' match out of him, and the Shane–Undertaker match ended up being a 30-minute snoozefest instead of the chaotic mess that everyone wanted\". Keith praised the Women's Championship match and Zack Ryder for having his \"WrestleMania moment\".\nAaron Oster of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"fans witnessed a roller-coaster ride that brought the WWE Universe from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows. Before looking at the bad, it's worth pointing out that there was also a lot of good\". However, Oster felt that while WrestleMania 31 tried to \"cater to disgruntled fans\", WrestleMania 32 \"felt like a six-hour attempt to piss off that same demo\", especially the event's ending, which caused fans to feel \"betrayed\" after \"dream endings\" at WrestleMania XXX and 31.\nIn the 2016 Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards, WrestleMania 32 was voted the Worst Major Wrestling Show of the year.\nAftermath.\nDespite Shane McMahon failing to gain control of \"Raw\" with a loss to the Undertaker at WrestleMania 32, he was awarded control of the next four episodes of \"Raw\" anyway post-WrestleMania. The post-WrestleMania \"Raw\" on April 4 began with Vince McMahon dismissing the crowd as crazy, and bragging how no one had a hold on him since he received the lockbox. Shane McMahon interrupted for a handshake with Vince, then thanked fans. Jealous of Shane supposedly upstaging him with strong fan support, Vince allowed Shane to run \"Raw\" that night, as Vince (thinking that Shane would produce a \"disaster\") wanted to show the world how \"ridiculous\" it would be. Shane was then allowed to continue controlling \"Raw\" until the Payback pay-per-view \"due to the overwhelming support of the WWE Universe on social media\".\nAlso on the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", where commentators described the crowd as booing those they should cheer, and cheering those they should boo, new world champion Roman Reigns (repeatedly and heavily booed) declared he was now \"the guy\" and was ready for title contenders. Four men answered the challenge: Chris Jericho, AJ Styles, Kevin Owens, and Sami Zayn. The four brawled, ultimately leaving Jericho in the ring, where Reigns attacked him. Shane McMahon then arranged a fatal four-way match between the four to determine the next world title contender. After Owens attacked Zayn backstage with a powerbomb through a table, Zayn was unable to compete, so Shane replaced him with a returning Cesaro in the four-way match. Styles pinned Jericho to win and become number one contender. Two weeks later, a match between Zayn and Owens was scheduled for Payback.\nMeanwhile, Zack Ryder's reign as the new Intercontinental Champion lasted just one day. On the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", Ryder was goaded into defending his title against the Miz. During the match, Ryder's father was slapped by Miz's wife, Maryse, in her return to WWE television. This distraction cost Ryder the match and the title. A championship rematch took place on the following \"SmackDown\", where The Miz again retained.\nA ceremony presenting Charlotte with the new WWE Women's Championship occurred on the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", with WWE Hall of Famer Lita and many of WWE's female wrestlers present in the ring. After Charlotte thanked her father, Ric Flair, and began bragging about her own success, most of the women left the ceremony, leaving Natalya to confront Charlotte and apply her signature Sharpshooter submission. Natalya and Charlotte faced each other for the WWE Women's Championship the following week, where Ric pulled the referee out of the ring while Charlotte submitted, causing a disqualification win for Natalya, but Charlotte retained. A rematch between the two was later scheduled for Payback, where the referee awarded the match to Charlotte despite Natalya never submitting. A submission match between the two was later scheduled for Extreme Rules with Ric banned from ringside, where Charlotte retained after interference from Dana Brooke. Afterwards, Charlotte turned on Ric as she felt like she no longer needed him, and aligned herself with Brooke.\nThe post-WrestleMania episode of \"Raw\" included \"Raw\" debuts of Baron Corbin, Apollo Crews, Enzo Amore, and Colin Cassady. Corbin fought Dolph Ziggler to a double count-out, then laid Ziggler out post-match. Meanwhile, Crews defeated Tyler Breeze. Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady debuted by confronting The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley), who had just defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) in a WrestleMania rematch, albeit in a tables match. A match between Ziggler and Corbin was later scheduled for Payback.\nThe New Day defended the WWE Tag Team Championship against The League of Nations (Sheamus and King Barrett). The New Day retained the titles after Kingston gained the pinfall over Barrett. Incensed by the loss, the group turned on Barrett, labeling him the group's \"weakest link\", but were subsequently attacked by The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan, and Braun Strowman).\nOn the April 21 episode of \"SmackDown\", Ryback defeated United States Champion Kalisto in a non-title match to earn a United States Championship rematch at Payback.\nOn the April 11 episode of \"Raw\", Shane McMahon announced a tag team tournament to decide the number one contenders to The New Day's WWE Tag Team Championships. The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) advanced by defeating The Lucha Dragons (Sin Cara and Kalisto), while The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The Social Outcasts (Curtis Axel and Heath Slater) to advance. After the match, The Usos were attacked by the returning Luke Gallows and the debuting Karl Anderson, who are recognized as two members of the Bullet Club stable in Japan. On the April 18 episode, the finals of the tournament was scheduled for Payback.\nAfter helping Total Divas win their match at WrestleMania, Brie Bella announced that she was taking an extended break from wrestling on April 6, 2016, so that she could focus on starting a family with her retired husband Daniel Bryan.\nThe \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported that post-WrestleMania, Roman Reigns became more \"reactive\" against hostile crowds when \"a camera isn't there to capture it\", this included \"yelling back and swearing at the vocal ringsiders\". This was contrasted with John Cena, who \"would laugh and smile at people who booed him.\" Reigns was again booed at the next pay-per-view, Payback, where he again won in the main event. As soon as broadcasting for that event stopped, Reigns reportedly turned on the crowd, yelling angrily at them. Meanwhile, WWE continued to try to hide the hostile reaction to Reigns, editing a fan sign for a photo on WWE.com for Payback's main event to remove a quote that Reigns \"bores\".\nWrestleMania 32 was the last WrestleMania to occur before the reintroduction of the brand split in July, which again split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. As such, another world championship was introduced, the WWE Universal Championship, thus it was also the last WrestleMania to feature one world championship.\nSasha Banks would earn another shot at Charlotte's WWE Women's Championship (renamed to Raw Women's Championship after SummerSlam) after making her submit in a tag team match at Battleground. The following night on \"Raw\", Banks defeated Charlotte to win the title for the first time. They then traded the championship four times, and their rivalry would go all the way to on December 18, where Charlotte defeated Banks 3–2 in overtime of a 30-minute Iron Woman match to regain the title and end their rivalry."

        "text": "WrestleMania 33 was the 33rd annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on April 2, 2017, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida, and was the third WrestleMania held at the state of Florida after XXIV (at the same venue) and XXVIII. The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) served as the hosts of the event. It was the first WrestleMania to feature Goldberg since WrestleMania 20.\nThirteen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. For the first time since WrestleMania 29 in 2013, two world championships were contested: Raw's Universal Championship and SmackDown's WWE Championship; it marked the first time that the Universal Championship, SmackDown Women's Championship, and new Cruiserweight Championship were defended at WrestleMania. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred match, giving Undertaker his second loss at WrestleMania. Whilst the loss and the events immediately following the main event served to insinuate that The Undertaker had retired, he would return to in-ring competition in 2018 at WrestleMania 34. In the main match for the Raw brand, Brock Lesnar defeated Goldberg to win the Universal Championship, thus becoming the first wrestler to win both the WWE and Universal titles, and in the main match from SmackDown, Randy Orton defeated Bray Wyatt to win his ninth WWE Championship. The event also marked the surprise return of The Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy), who won the Raw Tag Team Championship. It was also the first WrestleMania to be on the air past midnight Eastern time.\nReception towards the event was mixed, although it was largely considered to be an improvement over WrestleMania 32. Praise was directed towards Styles vs. McMahon, Owens vs. Jericho, the ladder match, Rollins vs. Triple H, and the Universal Championship match. Criticism was reserved for the main event, the WWE Championship match, and the overall length of the show, which stretched past the seven hour mark.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is considered WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched that broadcasting outlet in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. Announced on March 8, 2016, WrestleMania 33 was scheduled to be held on April 2, 2017, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. The event featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions, following the reintroduction of the brand split in July 2016. It was the first WrestleMania to feature the Universal Championship, following its introduction on Raw in July 2016 after the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and renamed to WWE Championship. It was also the first WrestleMania to feature the SmackDown Women's Championship and new WWE Cruiserweight Championship.\nThe event was the third to be held in the state of Florida, after XXIV (at the same venue) and XXVIII. Tickets went on sale on November 18, 2016, with individual tickets costing $38 to $2,130. On October 31, 2016, traveling packages with accommodation ranging from $950 to $5,900 per person were sold. A two-hour Kickoff pre-show preceded the main show, with the second hour broadcast simultaneously on USA Network. On February 20, 2017, The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) of WWE's Raw brand were confirmed to be the hosts of WrestleMania 33.\nThe four official theme songs for the event were \"Greenlight\" (by Pitbull feat. Flo Rida and LunchMoney Lewis), \"Like a Champion\" (by Danger Twins), \"Flame\" (by Tinashe), and \"Am I Savage?\" (by Metallica). At the event, Pitbull performed \"Options\" with Stephen Marley before performing \"Greenlight\" with Flo Rida and LunchMoney Lewis. American singer Tinashe performed \"America the Beautiful\" to kick off WrestleMania 33. The pre-show was broadcast on the WWE Network, WWE.com, Facebook, Google+, Pinterest, and YouTube, with USA Network joining the live coverage for the second hour.\nBeginning at WrestleMania 32, a match between Big Show and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal had been teased from various media outlets, including WWE. Shaq was a surprise entrant in the 2016 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he and Big Show faced off, but the other participants eliminated both of them. In July at the 2016 ESPY Awards on the red carpet, Show and Shaq had another brief confrontation. A match was proposed for WrestleMania 33, which Shaq accepted. In January 2017, the two began calling each other out on social media, posting workout videos of themselves preparing for the potential match. Big Show then began to doubt Shaq's commitment to the match. By the end of February, Shaq said that it looked like the match was not going to happen, but he would still train just in case. The following week, Shaq said that discussions were back on between him and WWE. However, Big Show's announcement as a participant in the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal indicated that the match was off. According to Dave Meltzer of \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal. Big Show said that he really wanted to do the match, especially since this would probably be his last WrestleMania and blamed Shaq's weight as a reason for why Shaq backed out.\nAccording to wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer in January 2017, a WrestleMania 33 match between The Undertaker and John Cena was scrapped as Vince McMahon had \"a different vision for the show and [was] thinking [about the] longterm picture not short-term\".\nSince 2014, WWE had attempted to establish Roman Reigns as their top babyface and the next 'face of the company', but a significant portion of fans rejected Reigns in this role, taking issue with his perceived special treatment, real-life demeanor, wrestling moveset, speaking skills and character presentation. This resulted in Reigns being booed while he wrestled in the main events of WrestleMania 31 and WrestleMania 32. Reigns was even voted as 2016's \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers, a first for a heroic character since the award was devised in 1972. In response to the negative reception, Reigns said that there is \"possible jealousy\" from fans regarding his \"major success\". In March 2017 before WrestleMania 33, wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer reported that WWE's long term plans (\"which obviously could change\") leading to WrestleMania 34 was to \"once again build for a year and have the big coronation\" for Reigns, who would still be a heroic character \"between now and then\" and beat Brock Lesnar for the Universal Championship \"to fully replace John Cena as the lead babyface of the company\", while the \"idea\" for Lesnar's role \"for years now\" was \"to become a monster, be unbeatable, run through everybody, and then lose to Roman Reigns\".\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 13 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nMain event.\nAt the Royal Rumble, The Undertaker was eliminated by Roman Reigns in the titular match. In the ensuing stare down, Reigns exclaimed: \"This is my yard now!\", a claim Undertaker had made for many years. On the March 6 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker attacked Reigns with a chokeslam, and a match between the two was scheduled for WrestleMania 33 in what would become the main event.\nWorld championship matches.\nAt the Royal Rumble, SmackDown's Randy Orton won his second Royal Rumble match, earning himself a world championship match at WrestleMania 33 for his brand's WWE Championship. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt won the Elimination Chamber match to become the new WWE Champion. As a devoted Wyatt Family member, Orton relinquished his championship opportunity. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a battle royal to determine Wyatt's WrestleMania challenger; it ended in a draw when both AJ Styles and Luke Harper hit the ground simultaneously. Styles then defeated Harper the following week to earn the title match, but at the conclusion of the episode, Orton restated his intentions to challenge Wyatt for the WWE Championship by appearing at the Wyatt Family compound, where Wyatt Family's matriarch Sister Abigail was buried, and setting the compound ablaze, turning face in the process. A number one contender's match between Orton and Styles was scheduled in which Orton won.\nAt WrestleMania XX in 2004, Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar in their first match against each other. Both left the company after the event, but Lesnar returned in 2012. After twelve years, Goldberg returned in 2016 and immediately began a feud with Lesnar. He defeated Lesnar at Survivor Series in one minute and twenty-six seconds, and also quickly eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The next night on \"Raw\", Lesnar and Paul Heyman appeared and challenged Goldberg to one final match at WrestleMania 33. Goldberg accepted Lesnar's challenge and also challenged Kevin Owens for the Universal Championship at Fastlane, which he won, turning their match into a title match for the Universal title. The following night on \"Raw\", new Universal Champion Goldberg came out but was interrupted by Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman. Lesnar attempted to shake Goldberg's hand to congratulate him, but Goldberg refused. Heyman then said that Goldberg would be \"Brock's bitch\" at WrestleMania and Lesnar attacked Goldberg with an F-5. The following week, Lesnar and Heyman gloated about Lesnar's attack on Goldberg. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, Goldberg and Lesnar had one last confrontation where Goldberg speared Lesnar.\nUndercard matches.\nIn 2014, The Shield (Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns) were involved in a rivalry with Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton, and Batista). After multiple losses to The Shield and Batista quitting WWE, Triple H recruited Rollins to The Authority. Rollins was the forefront of The Authority and won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (later renamed WWE Championship) at WrestleMania 31, but was forced to vacate the title in November 2015 due to injury. He returned in mid-2016, and during a fatal four-way for the vacant WWE Universal Championship, Triple H aided Rollins in eliminating Reigns, but then turned on Rollins by attacking him with a Pedigree, costing Rollins the match. During the first months of 2017, Rollins started a rivalry with Triple H, asking for answers. At , Rollins appeared and challenged Triple H to a match, who had Rollins escorted from the building by security. On the January 30 episode of \"Raw\", as Rollins was about to confront Triple H, Samoa Joe attacked Rollins, re-injuring his knee. Rollins was estimated to be out of action for up to eight weeks, but after an attack from Triple H, Rollins signed a contract for a non-sanctioned match with Triple H at WrestleMania 33, which forbid Rollins from suing WWE if he were to get injured again.\nAfter losing the WWE Championship at Royal Rumble, AJ Styles asked for a rematch, which SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon promised if Styles did not win the title back in the Elimination Chamber match. At the event, Bray Wyatt won the championship. Styles received a rematch, but in the form of a triple threat match, also including John Cena, where Wyatt retained. After Randy Orton relinquished his championship opportunity, Styles entered into a number one contender's battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. After defeating Harper to become the number one contender, Orton restated his intentions to challenge for the title, so McMahon and Daniel Bryan decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. The following week, Styles attacked McMahon and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured McMahon challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania 33, which Styles accepted.\nIn mid-2016, Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens began teaming and assisting each other. Jericho played a part in Owens winning the vacant Universal Championship. Over the next several months, Jericho assisted Owens in retaining his title in various defenses. The two also defeated Roman Reigns in a handicap match, with Jericho winning Reigns' United States Championship. After Owens retained his title at the Royal Rumble, Jericho accepted Goldberg's challenge on Owens' behalf for the Universal Championship at Fastlane, which was made official to the dismay of Owens. Jericho then held a \"Festival of Friendship\" for Owens, who turned on Jericho and brutally attacked him. In retaliation, Jericho cost Owens his Universal Championship match at Fastlane. On the following \"Raw\", Jericho challenged Owens to a match at WrestleMania 33. Owens agreed only if it were for the United States Championship, and Jericho agreed.\nAt Elimination Chamber, The Miz was eliminated by John Cena in the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match. Cena then eliminated Miz in the number one contender battle royal, and Miz retaliated by returning and eliminating Cena. Cena was then a guest on \"Miz TV\" where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically doing the same thing that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that despite his hard work, he does not get the same opportunities as Cena, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33. Cena criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Cena's girlfriend Nikki Bella then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. During the following weeks, Miz and Maryse made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show \"Total Bellas\" by impersonating them in \"unaired footage\". This ultimately led to Daniel Bryan scheduling a mixed tag team match between the two couples at WrestleMania.\nAt , Charlotte Flair defeated Sasha Banks to win her record fourth Raw Women's Championship, ending their long feud and, as per a post-event stipulation, as long as one of them was champion, the other could not challenge for the title. Charlotte then began a feud with Bayley, losing the title against her on the February 13 episode of \"Raw\", thanks to help from Banks. Also during this time, Banks entered into a feud with Nia Jax. Bayley retained the title against Flair at Fastlane after an interference from Banks, who defeated Jax on the Kickoff pre-show. The following weeks, Bayley was defeated by Banks and Jax. Both Flair and Banks touted their reasons why they should challenge Bayley for the title at WrestleMania 33, leading to a triple threat match being scheduled. Jax was then added, turning the match into a fatal four-way elimination match. On \"Raw\", Bayley and Banks teamed up and defeated Flair and Jax. After the match, Jax laid out her three WrestleMania opponents.\nOn the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to win the Raw Tag Team Championship. Cesaro and Sheamus invoked their rematch, but lost due to interference from Enzo Amore and Big Cass. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", Amore and Cass defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to receive a tag title match at Fastlane, where Gallows and Anderson retained. A rematch occurred the following night on \"Raw\" where Cesaro and Sheamus got involved, costing Enzo and Cass the titles. Later on, Raw General Manager Mick Foley scheduled Cesaro and Sheamus to face Amore and Cass on the next episode, with the winners going on to challenge Gallows and Anderson for the titles at WrestleMania 33. However, during that match, Gallows and Anderson attacked both teams, causing a double disqualification. Foley then scheduled Gallows and Anderson to defend the titles against both teams at WrestleMania in a triple threat match. The following weeks, Gallows and Anderson attacked the others with a ladder. The WrestleMania match was then turned into a triple threat ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship.\nAt Elimination Chamber, Naomi defeated Alexa Bliss to win the SmackDown Women's Championship, but a legit injury forced her to relinquish the title. Bliss then defeated Becky Lynch for the vacant title. On the March 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", Becky, Natalya, and even Bliss' ally Mickie James all demanded to challenge for the championship at WrestleMania 33. Daniel Bryan decided that Bliss would defend the title against all available female SmackDown wrestlers at WrestleMania. On the final \"SmackDown\" before WrestleMania, Naomi returned and confirmed that she would be in the match at WrestleMania, making it a six-pack challenge.\nPre-show matches.\nAt Elimination Chamber during the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match, Baron Corbin was eliminated by the Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose. Then, Corbin executed the \"End of Days\" on him before he left the chamber, causing his elimination. During the following weeks, both wrestlers attacked each other, leading to a match at WrestleMania for the Intercontinental title. The match was moved to the Kickoff pre-show.\nAfter retaining the WWE Cruiserweight Championship for several months, Neville said there was no one left in the cruiserweight division that could compete with him. Austin Aries, who had been out of action due to injury, disagreed and attacked Neville. On the March 14 episode of \"205 Live\", Aries won a fatal five-way elimination match to face Neville for the title on the WrestleMania 33 Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the two-hour long WrestleMania 33 Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, Neville defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Austin Aries. In the climax, as Aries applied the \"Last Chancery\" on Neville, Neville poked Aries' eyes to escape and performed a \"Red Arrow\" on Aries to retain the title.\nNext, 33 wrestlers competed in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, including previously unannounced participants Kalisto, Sin Cara, Luke Harper, Titus O'Neil, The Vaudevillains (Simon Gotch and Aiden English) and The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor). In the climax, Jinder Mahal taunted New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who was sitting at ringside. This prompted Gronkowski to enter the ring and shove Mahal. Mojo Rawley then eliminated Mahal to win the match.\nIn the last pre-show match, Dean Ambrose defended the Intercontinental Championship against Baron Corbin. In the end, Corbin attempted the \"End of Days\" on Ambrose, who countered and performed \"Dirty Deeds\" on Corbin to retain the title.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the hosts, The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), who were dressed as characters inspired by \"\", a sponsor of the event. They made their entrance and hyped the live crowd for the event.\nIn the first match, AJ Styles faced Shane McMahon. During the match, Styles attempted a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on Styles, who then countered into a one-armed \"Styles Clash\" on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, Styles attempted a \"Coast-to-Coast\" on Shane, who countered by attacking Styles with a trash can. Shane then performed a \"Coast-to-Coast\" into a trash can on Styles for a near-fall. Shane attempted a \"Leap of Faith\" through an announce table on Styles, who moved and Shane fell through the announce table. As Styles attempted a \"Phenomenal Forearm\", Shane countered into a float-over DDT on Styles. Shane attempted a shooting star press, but Styles avoided and performed a \"Phenomenal Forearm\" on Shane to win the match.\nNext, Chris Jericho defended the United States Championship against Kevin Owens. Owens attempted a pop-up powerbomb on Jericho, who countered and performed a \"Lionsault\" on Owens for a near-fall. Owens applied the \"Walls of Jericho\" on Jericho, who escaped. Owens performed a pop-up powerbomb on Jericho for a near-fall. As Owens attempted a second pop-up powerbomb on Jericho, Jericho countered into a \"Codebreaker\" on Owens, who touched the ring ropes with one finger to void the pinfall at a two count. In the end, Owens performed a powerbomb on Jericho onto the ring apron and pinned him to win his first United States Championship.\nAfter that, Bayley defended the Raw Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair, Nia Jax and Sasha Banks in a fatal four-way elimination match. Bayley, Flair, and Banks performed a triple powerbomb on Jax and all three pinned Jax to eliminate her. Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\" on Flair, who escaped. Banks attempted a pinning combination on Flair, who kicked out and sent Banks into an exposed turnbuckle, after which, Flair pinned Banks to eliminate her. In the end, Flair collided with the exposed turnbuckle, allowing Bayley to perform a diving elbow drop on Flair to retain the title.\nIn the fourth match, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson were originally scheduled to defend the Raw Tag Team Championship against Cesaro and Sheamus and Enzo Amore and Big Cass in a triple threat ladder match. Before the match, hosts The New Day announced that the returning Hardy Boyz (Jeff Hardy and Matt Hardy) would also be involved in the match. In the end, Matt performed a \"Twist of Fate\" off a ladder on Anderson and Jeff performed a \"Swanton Bomb\" off a ladder through a bridged ladder on Cesaro and Sheamus. Matt then retrieved the title belts to win the championship for the first time as a team; individually, the first time for Jeff and the second time for Matt.\nLater, John Cena and Nikki Bella faced The Miz and Maryse in a mixed tag team match with Al Roker serving as the special guest ring announcer. In the end, as Bella and Maryse were the legal wrestlers, Cena and Bella performed \"Five Knuckle Shuffles\" on Miz and Maryse. Cena performed an \"Attitude Adjustment\" on Miz whilst Bella performed a \"Rack Attack 2.0\" on Maryse. Cena and Bella pinned both Miz and Maryse to win the match. After the match, Cena proposed to Nikki, who accepted.\nNext, Seth Rollins then faced Triple H in a non-sanctioned match. During the match, Rollins attempted a \"Pedigree\" on Triple H, who countered into a DDT on Rollins onto an announce table. Triple H targeted Rollins' leg, applying an inverted figure-four leglock on Rollins, who rolled out of the ring to escape the hold. Triple H retrieved his signature sledgehammer, only for Rollins to perform an enzuigiri on Triple H. As Rollins retrieved the sledgehammer, Stephanie McMahon snatched the weapon away from Rollins. This allowed Triple H to perform a \"Pedigree\" on Rollins for a near-fall. As Triple H attempted a \"Pedigree\" on Rollins from the top rope, Rollins countered and performed a \"Phoenix Splash\" on Triple H for a near-fall. After trading counters, Rollins performed a superkick on Triple H, who bumped into Stephanie, causing her to crash through a table. Rollins then performed a \"Pedigree\" on Triple H to win the match.\nNext, Bray Wyatt defended the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. At the beginning of the match, Orton attempted an \"RKO\" on Wyatt, who rolled out of the ring. During the match, Wyatt played mind games on Orton by having large images of different insects appear on the ring canvas. Outside of the ring, Wyatt performed \"Sister Abigail\" on Orton into the barricade. Orton then performed an \"RKO\" on Wyatt and scored a near-fall. Wyatt performed \"Sister Abigail\" on Orton for a near-fall. Orton then performed another \"RKO\" on Wyatt to win his ninth WWE Championship and his first at WrestleMania.\nAfter that, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Brock Lesnar. Lesnar performed three German suplexes on Goldberg, who quickly recovered and performed two spears on Lesnar, who then rolled out of the ring. Goldberg then performed a spear on Lesnar through the barricade into the timekeeper's area. Goldberg got Lesnar back into the ring and attempted a \"Jackhammer\", but Lesnar countered and attempted an \"F-5\" on Goldberg, who also countered and performed another spear, followed by a \"Jackhammer\" on Lesnar, who became the first man to kick-out of the spear-\"Jackhammer\" combo. Goldberg attempted the fifth spear, but Lesnar avoided Goldberg with a leapfrog and performed seven more German suplexes on him. Lesnar then performed an \"F-5\" on Goldberg to win his first Universal Championship and gave Goldberg his first clean singles loss of his career. This win also made Lesnar the first wrestler to win both the WWE Championship and Universal Championship.\nIn the penultimate match, Alexa Bliss defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Becky Lynch, Naomi, Mickie James, Natalya, and Carmella in a six-pack challenge. The end came when Naomi forced Bliss to submit to the \"Slay-o-Mission\" to win her second SmackDown Women's Championship, tying the record.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, the match between The Undertaker and Roman Reigns was revealed to be a No Holds Barred match. Jim Ross returned as a guest commentator. In the ringside, Undertaker threw Reigns to one of the steel steps and performed a Chokeslam on him onto an announce table, who then performed a Spear on Undertaker through another announce table. Undertaker performed a Last Ride on Reigns for a near-fall. Reigns performed two Superman Punches on Undertaker, who attacked Reigns with a chair and performed a Chokeslam on him onto it for a near-fall. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Reigns for a near-fall. As Undertaker attempted a second Tombstone Piledriver, Reigns countered into a Superman Punch for a near-fall. Reigns executed another Spear, but Undertaker applied Hell's Gate, with Reigns managing to escape. Reigns attacked Undertaker with the same chair and performed two Spears, with both scored near-falls. Undertaker attempted his signature sit-up, but suddenly collapsed. After another Spear, Reigns pinned Undertaker to win the match and become the second person to defeat Undertaker at WrestleMania after Brock Lesnar ended The Streak at WrestleMania XXX. After the match, The Undertaker symbolically left his gloves, coat and hat in the center of the ring. In a very rare moment, Undertaker broke character and shared a kiss with his wife Michelle McCool, who was seated in the front row crying. Undertaker walked to the center of the entrance ramp, looked at the crowd and raised his arm, as he was lowered below the stage to the sound of his music and his signature gong sounded three times, as the show ended. In the arena, the main stage lighting (not the crowd's lighting) was left off for the remainder of the evening and Undertaker's clothes were left in the ring, as the production crew cleaned up only taking his clothing articles when it was time to disassemble the ring.\nReception.\nWrestleMania 33 received mixed reviews from critics. Matt Geradi and Kevin Pang of \"The A.V. Club\" co-reviewed WrestleMania. Pang criticized the event for being \"long and exhausting to watch at home\", with \"nothing that would win match-of-the-year in a 2017 poll\" and \"minimum\" surprises. Geradi felt that the event exceeded his expectations and \"the storytelling was on point all night\", but it was a \"tremendously front-loaded show\". Yet Geradi and Pang agreed that everything \"didn't matter\" as WrestleMania \"was about one story—the end of The Undertaker\"; both reviewers agreed that the main event was \"sad\", with Pang also describing it as \"ugly\". Although \"Shawn Michaels' sympathy and expressiveness\" made Ric Flair's retirement at WrestleMania \"moving and memorable\", Geradi chided Reigns for having \"barely mustered an ounce of anything other than disbelief and exasperation\" as it \"was business as usual for The Big Dog\". For the other matches, Pang wrote that Aries–Neville fulfilled expectations as the \"best technical match\" with an \"especially killer\" finish, while Gerardi described Jericho–Owens as \"really solidly worked with some clever, unique spots, and the in-ring story with all the counters was great stuff\".\nDave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" described WrestleMania 33 as \"a long but extremely newsworthy show\" finished off with the \"retirement\" ceremony for the Undertaker, whose match was \"as good as could be expected as they went long\". Meltzer described that though the crowd was tired at the finish of the main event, WWE \"did clearly turn down the sound\" and \"then they hit the pyro\". For the Universal title match, Meltzer wrote that it \"was what was expected\" and the \"match was pretty much perfect considering how late it was\", with the live audience \"going nuts through all of this\". For McMahon–Styles, Meltzer commented that the \"match had its moments that were spectacular\", and that the \"story was that Shane was the real striker and got the better of that\". For Ambrose–Corbin, Meltzer felt it was \"certainly a lot less than you'd think for a WrestleMania match\", while the Raw women's match was \"too short for an elimination match\", and the Raw tag team title match \"wasn't as good as what most WrestleMania ladder matches but the crowd went completely nuts for the Hardys\". Although WWE \"may have turned down the crowd noise\" for Cena's proposal, Meltzer felt the proposal was \"really great\". Lastly, Meltzer said that Rawley winning the battle royal was \"largely for the mainstream coverage of Rob Gronkowski\".\nJack de Menezes of \"The Independent\" wrote that WrestleMania 33 was \"an emotional night for fans\", especially due to the \"brutal ending\" of the Undertaker's career. With Reigns' \"disappointing, error-strewn display ... compared to some of the other eye-catching displays at WrestleMania\", de Menezes questioned if the \"obvious passing of the torch by the WWE\" was \"the right decision\". For the other memorable moments of the night, de Menezes described the return of The Hardy Boyz as \"incredible and triumphant\", the Orton–Wyatt match as a \"creepy and disturbing affair\", Naomi recapturing the SmackDown women's title as \"a homecoming to remember\", McMahon–Styles as a match \"filled with highlight moments\" and Cena's proposal as \"unthinkable\".\nLuis Paez-Pumar of \"Rolling Stone\" described WrestleMania as \"two-faced as a Gemini\"—the first half \"was a brisk hybrid of styles and matches that made you think that WWE knew what it was doing all along with this lackluster build\", but once Triple H appeared, the rest of the event \"was a slog of plodding wrestling, brief matches and boos\". Paez-Pumar described that The Undertaker as \"should have retired when the Streak was broken\", but \"lived on to pass the rub onto Reigns in the sloppiest, saddest manner possible\". Paez-Pumar proclaimed that \"WWE has no idea how to handle Bray Wyatt\", writing that Orton \"definitely did not need the title\" and ridiculing Wyatt's conjuring of \"projected video screen grossness\" as \"the dumbest crap\". Paez-Pumar called for \"fresh blood or new ideas\" in both women's divisions and for Triple H to retire given that he \"has not put on a good Mania match\" since 2005 or 2006 once WrestleMania XXX was discounted. For the positives, Goldberg–Lesnar was a \"revitalizing adrenaline shot to the spine\", Cena's proposal was \"magic in a way that no other entertainment can match\", The New Day \"were excellent hosts; funny when called upon and out of the way when not\", while \"a stale-ass tag team division just became the most must-see part of \"Raw\"\" due to the return of the Hardys. The match between Orton and Wyatt was voted by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter as the Worst Match of the Year.\nIn 2020, The Undertaker said during an interview he was disappointed of his performance against Reigns.\nAftermath.\nThere had been much speculation that Undertaker had competed in his final match. While it was not confirmed on air, the WWE online merchandise store released a commemorative photo plaque showing a photo of Undertaker's gear that he left in the ring, with the description stating that he had ended his in-ring career. In addition, Dave Meltzer of \"Wrestling Observer\" reported that Undertaker would be getting surgeries for his injuries, specifically a hip replacement surgery that Undertaker held off due to his commitments with WWE. However, after being challenged to a match at WrestleMania the following year, Undertaker made an impromptu return and defeated John Cena at WrestleMania 34. Undertaker continued to wrestle sporadically over the next couple of years until he had his official final match at WrestleMania 36 where he defeated AJ Styles in a Boneyard match. His retirement ceremony was then held at Survivor Series on November 22, 2020, which also celebrated the 30th anniversary of his WWE debut, which occurred at the 1990 Survivor Series.\nAlthough John Cena had proposed to Nikki Bella at the event with plans to wed the following year, on April 15, 2018, Nikki announced on her Instagram account that she and Cena had ended their six-year-long relationship.\nChris Jericho admitted in 2021 during his appearance on \"The Broken Skull Sessions\" that the placement of his match with Kevin Owens was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back with WWE, making him seek work elsewhere. The original plan for WrestleMania was for Jericho to win the Universal Championship from Owens in the main event, but then Vince McMahon changed his mind. Jericho stated he understood why McMahon changed his mind, but opined that at the very least, his match with Owens should have been first. To have it shunted to the second match of the show meant to Jericho that he was always going to be a \"mid-card guy\" in WWE and he felt he still had main event potential, so he decided to look for work elsewhere.\nRaw.\nOn the post-WrestleMania 33 \"Raw\" the following night, the show opened with \"Undertaker\" and \"Roman sucks\" chants from the live audience, which was interrupted by Roman Reigns. After the crowd blasted Reigns with torrid boos and several minutes of hostile chants, Reigns left after only stating, \"This is my yard now!\" A lot of the crowd hostility arose from the speculation that WrestleMania 33 was The Undertaker's last match, as well as the long running fan opposition to Reigns. After that segment, WWE commentators labelled the post-WrestleMania 33 crowd as \"non-traditional WWE fans\" who may cheer for those they normally boo and boo those they normally cheer \"all in the name of fun\". This echoed similar comments a year prior for the post-WrestleMania 32 crowd, which \"The A.V. Club\" described as WWE's \"aggressive\" and condescending \"disclaimers\" meant to shame the hardcore audience.\nLater, new Universal Champion Brock Lesnar's advocate, Paul Heyman, declared that Goldberg would not be seen again and teased a match between Lesnar and Roman Reigns. Braun Strowman came out and declared that after he himself was done with Reigns, who he had been feuding with prior to WrestleMania, he would be coming for Lesnar and his title. After the show, on \"Raw Talk\", Goldberg stated that his WrestleMania match may have been his last, but hinted that he could return. The following week, Strowman brutally attacked Reigns during a backstage interview and overturned the ambulance that Reigns was in. Afterwards, Reigns was taken to the hospital in another ambulance. A match between the two was scheduled for Payback. Lesnar would hold on to the title for the remainder of the year. At WrestleMania 34, Lesnar and Reigns had a match for the title after it was teased by Heyman over a year ago.\nAlso on the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", WWE Chairman Vince McMahon explained that his daughter, Stephanie, would be off television for a while due to her crashing through a table at WrestleMania, and then introduced 2017 WWE Hall of Fame inductee Kurt Angle as the new Raw General Manager. He also announced that there would be a Superstar Shake-up the following week between Raw and SmackDown, a talent trade between the two brands.\nChris Jericho was granted a rematch for the United States Championship against Kevin Owens at Payback. He was then attacked backstage by Owens and Samoa Joe. Jericho was subsequently replaced in a tag team match by the returning Finn Bálor. On the April 11 episode of \"SmackDown\", the Superstar Shake-up moved Owens to SmackDown, but it was decided that if Jericho won the United States Championship at Payback, he would also move to SmackDown. Also, Seth Rollins resumed his rivalry with Samoa Joe and the two were scheduled to fight at Payback.\nAlso on the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\", The Hardy Boyz retained their Raw Tag Team Championship against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, while Cesaro and Sheamus earned a title shot at Payback by defeating Enzo Amore and Big Cass. The New Day issued an open challenge, which was answered by NXT's The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) in their main roster debut. The Revival defeated and continued to beat down New Day, injuring Kofi Kingston's ankle. The following week, The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods) lost a rematch against Revival and were moved to SmackDown as part of the Superstar Shake-up.\nIn the women's division, Raw Women's Champion Bayley, Sasha Banks, and Dana Brooke defeated Charlotte Flair, Nia Jax, and the returning Emma. The following week, Banks was about to challenge Bayley to a title match when she was interrupted by Alexa Bliss and Mickie James, who moved over from SmackDown as a result of the Superstar Shake-up; Charlotte was moved to the SmackDown brand. Bliss subsequently earned a title match at Payback by winning a fatal four-way match.\nSmackDown.\nOn the post-WrestleMania \"SmackDown\", Bray Wyatt challenged the newly-crowned WWE Champion Randy Orton to a \"House of Horrors\" non-title match, which Orton accepted. In the ensuing brawl, Luke Harper and the returning Erick Rowan came out to help Orton and Wyatt, respectively. Subsequently, Orton and Harper defeated Wyatt and Rowan. Wyatt was moved to Raw the following week and his rematch with Orton was scheduled for the Raw-exclusive pay-per-view, Payback.\nAlso on the post-WrestleMania \"SmackDown\", SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon addressed the Superstar Shake-Up. His WrestleMania opponent, AJ Styles, interrupted him, saying that he wanted to stay on SmackDown, and then shook Shane's hand out of respect. The following week, Styles was confirmed to stay on SmackDown and he defeated Baron Corbin and Sami Zayn, who had moved over from Raw, to become the number one contender for the United States Championship at Backlash.\nIn a non-title rematch, Baron Corbin defeated Intercontinental Champion Dean Ambrose in a Street Fight. This would be their last encounter as Ambrose, with the championship, moved to the Raw brand as a result of the Superstar Shake-up.\nThe Miz and Maryse continued their impersonation of John Cena and Nikki Bella. They claimed credit for Cena proposing to Nikki and mocked the newly-engaged couple, as they were taking a break from WWE post-WrestleMania. As they were leaving the ring, they were interrupted by the main roster debut of Shinsuke Nakamura. The Miz and Maryse were then moved to Raw, where they resumed their rivalry with Dean Ambrose. Jinder Mahal moved to SmackDown, where he continued his feud with Mojo Rawley and Rob Gronkowski. Rawley defeated Mahal following interference by Gronkowski. Both Mahal and Rawley then participated in a six-pack challenge, which Mahal won to become the #1 contender for the WWE Championship at Backlash.\nIn the women's division, Alexa Bliss lost her rematch for the SmackDown Women's Championship against Naomi. The following week, Bliss and Mickie James moved to Raw as a result of the Superstar Shake-up. Charlotte Flair, who moved over from Raw, defeated Naomi in a non-title match to become the number one contender.\n205 Live.\nIn the cruiserweight division on the post-WrestleMania \"205 Live\", Austin Aries earned another title shot by winning a fatal four-way match, and it was scheduled for Payback."

        "title": "Jane Jacobs (baseball)",
        "text": "Jane Jeanette Jacobs [Badini] (June 16, 1924 – September 13, 2015) was an American pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 130 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\nJane Jacobs was not a hard thrower, but her underhand fastball fooled batters because she was basically a curveball pitcher. Jacobs hurled an in-curve, out-curve, upshoot and specially a drop ball, her better pitch. Her most impressive start was having pitched a complete game-shutout one-hitter, but she fell victim to sidearm delivery when the league converted to it.\n\"Jake\", as her teammates nicknamed her, was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, where she started playing softball at the age of 11. In 1943, she was spotted by a league's scout when she was 18, but did not sign until a year later.\nJacobs entered the league in 1944 with the Racine Belles, playing for them two years. She did not have a winning season, even though she posted a 2.82 earned run average in 1945 and 2.86 in 1945, while compiling marks of 9–16 and 7–9, respectively. The team had a surplus of talent, so she was loaned to the Peoria Redwings the next year.\nIn 1946, according to the new AAGPBL rules of play, the pitchers were forced to switch gradually from underhand to sidearm delivery. Jacobs made the transition, with no small effort, and led the Redwings pitchers with a 2.13 ERA, which was a career-high. Though her success was not reflected in her 6–12 record due to poor run support.\nShe returned to Racine in 1947, when the league adopted full sidearm pitching regulations. This time she struggled to make the additional mandatory adjustment and went 2–6 with a 2.92 ERA. Then, for the third consecutive year the league set a new rule for a strictly overhand pitching in 1948. It spelled the end of Jacobs' career. \"I was afraid I'd ruin my arm\", she explained with resignation.\nIn a four-year career, she was managed by Racine's Leo Murphy and Peoria's Bill Rodgers. She finished with a 24–43 record and a 2.65 ERA in 88 pitching appearances.\nJacobs returned to her home of Ohio, where she operated her own dry cleaning business for 40 years. She married Mario Badini in 1973, and was widowed after 16 years of marriage. Jane was diagnosed with cancer in 1994, but survived the surgery and the follow-up treatments. After recuperating from cancer, she ran a ceramics business for a long time.\nShe is part of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Though she did not attend the ceremony, she traveled to Cooperstown in 2009 to see her name in the hall. \"I will definitely be back\", said the proud AAGPBL veteran.\nThe native of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio made the long pilgrimage along with a niece, her husband and their two daughters. She also extended her Cooperstown visit to the A. Bartlett Giamatti Research Center, where she both donated photos and clippings from her AAGPBL career and received copies of other photos from the Hall's archives. She even helped identify some former teammates who were unidentified in old team photos.\nCareer statistics.\nPitching\nBatting \nFielding"

        "text": "Carrie Lynn Daniels (née Thompson; born November 25, 1972) is an American college basketball coach and the former women's head coach at Austin Peay State University (APSU).\nEarly life and education.\nA native of Scottsburg, Indiana, Carrie Lynn Thompson attended Austin Peay after earning All-American honors as a senior at Scottsburg High School. At APSU, she starred on its first team to qualify for the NCAA women's basketball tournament in 1996. That season, she was awarded APSU's Joy Award, which is presented annually to the university's top athlete. She was presented the 1995 Wilma Rudolph Award, given by the National Association of Academic Advisors for Athletics to \"...honor student athletes who have overcome great personal, academic, and/or emotional odds to achieve academic success while participating in intercollegiate athletics...\" after missing most of the 1995–96 with a heart ailment. She earned her bachelor's degree from Austin Peay in 1996 and a master's degree in education from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) in 1999. She is married to Billy Daniels, who played for the APSU men's basketball team during the time she was playing on the women's team. They have one son, Dalton.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing her graduation from APSU, Daniels spent three years on the coaching staff of the women's basketball program at UNLV, serving as assistant coach to LaDonna Wilson-McClain, then as director of basketball operations to Regina Miller. She then was an assistant to three different head coaches during a seven-year stint at Western Kentucky University. On June 16, 2006, Daniels was named head coach of her alma mater. In her first six seasons, she led her teams to two OVC tournament titles and subsequent appearances in the NCAA tournament. With the first tournament title, she became the first APSU graduate to coach one of its teams into an NCAA tournament; with the second, she was the first APSU coach to qualify for an NCAA appearance twice. On March 9, 2015, APSU declined to renew Daniels' contract. Eight days later, Clarksville Academy hired Carrie Daniels as the new head girls' basketball coach.\nAustin Peay statistics.\nSource"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball player-managers",
        "text": "Major League Baseball (MLB) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball. Founded in 1869, it is composed of 30 teams. Each team in the league has a manager, who is responsible for team strategy and leadership on and off the field. Assisted by various coaches, the manager sets the line-up and starting pitcher before each game, and makes substitutions throughout the game. In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to serve as player-managers; that is, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. In the history of MLB, there have been 221 player-managers, 59 of whom are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nThe dual role of player-manager was formerly a common practice, dating back to John Clapp, who performed the task for the Middletown Mansfields in 1872. One reason for this is that by hiring a player as a manager, the team could save money by paying only one salary. Also, popular players were named player-managers in an effort to boost game attendance. Babe Ruth left the New York Yankees when they refused to allow him to become player-manager. Five of the eight National League (NL) managers in 1934 were also players. Connie Mack, John McGraw, and Joe Torre, among the all-time leaders in managerial wins, made their managerial debuts as player-managers. At least one man served as a player-manager in every major league season from Clapp's debut through 1955.\nToday, player-managers have become rare in baseball. Pete Rose is the most recent player-manager, serving from 1984 through 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds. Whereas some player-managers, such as Lou Boudreau, were full-time players as player-managers, by the time Rose became player-manager, he was a part-time player. Rose was trying to prolong his career to break the all-time hit record set by Ty Cobb, and Reds owner Marge Schott used this as a marketing ploy. Rose removed himself from the 40-man roster after the 1986 season to make room for Pat Pacillo, unofficially retiring as a player, but remained as the Reds manager until he was banned from baseball following the release of the Dowd Report in 1989.\nOne criticism of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, the job of a manager has become more complex. A player-manager needs to decide how much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player-manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player-manager.\nHowever, teams continue to consider hiring player-managers. The Toronto Blue Jays considered hiring Paul Molitor as a player-manager in 1997. When approached with the idea in 2000, Barry Larkin reported that he found it \"interesting\", though general manager (GM) Jim Bowden rejected the idea. In the 2011–12 offseason, the White Sox considered hiring incumbent first baseman Paul Konerko to serve as manager. White Sox GM Kenny Williams said that he believes MLB will again have a player-manager."

Many of the clubs run juniors in the Midlands Junior League.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby League Conference was born in 1997, as the Southern Conference. It featured teams from the South of England and the English Midlands. The Midlands Division was first created in 2001 and lasted until 2003; by 2004, there were enough Midlands teams playing in the conference for them to be split into smaller divisions.\nThe Premier Division were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and were able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. The new Premier Divisions included the North Premier, the South Premier, the Central Premier and the Welsh Premier. The Central Premier had two Midlands clubs Telford Raiders and Nottingham Outlaws and the rest of the clubs were from Yorkshire or Lancashire.\nThe Midlands Merit League was founded in late 2005 as a feeder league for the Rugby League Conference, in order to support the growth of rugby league in the Midlands. Clubs were able to play competitive games without committing to a full fixture list. It later evolved into the Midlands Rugby League Division Two.\nThe Midlands Premier was created one season later in 2006. With the new Midlands Premier division, there was only one Midlands regional division from 2006 but it would not be until 2010 that it would be known as the Midlands regional. In 2011, the Midlands teams were split into East and West divisions with group winners playing off for the Midlands Premier title and the losers competing for the Midlands regional.\nIn 2012 the Rugby League Conference was disbanded with the RLC Midlands Division becoming the Division One of the Midlands Rugby League. In 2013 there was no standalone division 1 but the title will nevertheless be played for by the teams finishing between fifth and eighth in the premier division.\nParticipating teams.\nEast.\nDivision One will be split into East and West regions with teams playing sides in their own region twice and the other one once giving a league season of 11 or 12 games followed by semi-finals for the top two in each region. The overall winner will be determined by a grand final.\nWolverhampton failed to complete the season but their results stood."

It is controlled by the British American Football Association.\nMen's Senior Team.\nHistory.\nThe Men's Senior GB Lions played their first game against France in 1985 at Stompond Lane. 2,000 attendees watched GB claim a 7–0 win thanks to a Victor Ebubedike touchdown. In 1986 and 1987, the Lions defeated the Netherlands and France over two legs each to qualify for the 1987 European Championship.\nAt their first major tournament, the Lions were defeated by Italy and Finland on their way to a 4th-place finish.\nIn 1989, they defeated France on the way to qualifying to their second consecutive championship. They defeated hosts Germany comprehensively in the semi-final thanks to Victor Ebubedike, Trevor Carthy and Allan Brown, who scored two touchdowns each in a 38–6 victory. The Terry Smith-led Lions met Finland in the final and got revenge for the 1987 defeat by shutting their rivals out in a 26–0 victory to claim their first European championship.\nIn 1991, the Lions, led by London Monarchs assistant Ray Willsey returned to defend their championship in Helsinki. After defeating the Netherlands 46–3 in the semi-final, they again met Finland in the Olympic Stadium and won 14–3 to claim back to back championships. 9 Lions; Tournament MVP Jason Elliott, Barry Driver, Mark Webb, Jo Richardson, Colin Nash, Paul Roberts, Warren Billingham, Gary Mills and Bola Ayiede.\nIn 1993, BAFA withdrew from the EFL and as such the Lions could not defend their title at the 1993 European Championships in Italy. In preparation for the 1995 European Championships in Austria, they defeated Ireland, but after Germany sensationally withdrew from the tournament, the Lions were hastily scheduled to play Ukraine away and potentially two further games in Austria within the space of eight days. Unable to handle the logistics, the Lions pulled out of the 1995 championships.\nIn 1997, the Lions returned to European competition, defeating Spain in Estadio La Peineta to qualify for the European Championships. In the semi-final, they lost 14–7 to Finland, and were defeated 24-6 by Finland in the third/fourth place playoff.\nAfter the 1999 European Championships were suspended, the Lions were invited to take part in the inaugural IFAF World Championship but declined the offer. Ahead of the 2000 European Championship, head coach Riq Ayub resigned, and the Lions were again defeated by Finland.\nIn 2001, the Lions defeated Spain to qualify for the European Championships, where they expected to receive a semi-final bye after the disqualification of Germany. However, following a successful appeal, Germany were reinstated into the tournament and would face the Lions in the semi-final. Unable to fulfil the fixture at such short notice, the Lions were expelled from the tournament.\nFollowing a reformatting of the European Championships, the 2005 Championship saw nations divided into three pools. In 2004, The Lions were placed in Pool B, and defeated Russia, Spain and France to win their pool, and qualify for Pool A of the championship. The Lions were defeated by the visiting Centre Colonels from Kentucky at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, and were shut out by the one-seeded German team in the semi-final. In the bronze medal match, they were defeated by Finland 34–12.\nIn 2009, the Lions were defeated in a friendly by Australia but defeated reigning European champions Sweden in their next game. In the 2010 European Championships, the Lions were defeated by France, Sweden and Finland, scoring only 11 points on their way to a 6th-place finish. The Lions finished 3rd in the Group B Qualification tournament in Milan in 2013 and therefore did qualify to compete in the 2014 Championships.\nGB Students.\nHistory.\nGB Students were founded in 1993 as a BCAFL \"Allstars\" team, coached by Damian Bayford from the University of Leeds. They were renamed the Bulldogs in the mid-1990s and mostly played touring teams.\nAfter falling under the remit of BUCS in 2008, the governing body refused to sanction entry into the 2014 FISU World Championships.\nDue to financial limitations and administrative errors, blamed on both BAFA and BUCS, it was announced there would be no GB Students team at the 2016 World Championships in Mexico, which resulted in the resignation of head coach, Wayne Hill.\nUnder-19 Team.\nThe Great Britain U-19 American Football team represent the nation in international competition of youth American Football.\nWomen's team.\nThe Great Britain Women's Team were founded in 2012 and represent the nation in Women's American football. In the 2015 European Championships, the team finished as runners-up, losing to Finland 50–12, their first ever defeat, in the final.\nFlag Football.\nBAFA also runs three flag football teams for men, women and under-19s."

        "text": "The 2011–12 Ivy League men's basketball season marked the continuation of the annual tradition of competitive basketball among Ivy League members that began when the league was formed during the 1956–57 season, continuing from the predecessor Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, which was formed in 1902. Harvard was the preseason favorite for the first time and spent most of the season receiving vote in the 2011–12 national rankings. The season marked the first time that four Ivy League teams (Harvard, Penn, Princeton and Yale) participated in the postseason. The season marked the second time that the Ivy League had three 20-win teams (Harvard, Penn and Princeton).\nZack Rosen earned Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year and earned Associated Press All-American honorable mention recognition. Reggie Willhite was Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and Shonn Miller was the Conference Rookie of the Year. In addition to Rosen, Ian Hummer was a unanimous first team All-Ivy League selection. The conference had two Academic All-America honorees (Matthew Sullivan and Chris Wroblewski) and a Lowe's Senior CLASS Award finalist (Rosen).\nPreseason.\nEntering the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season head coach Mitch Henderson began his tenure at Princeton. Greg Mangano was one of 22 USA Basketball invitees to the USA Basketball Men's World University Games Team training camp to select the team for the 2011 Summer Universiade held at Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. He competed in basketball at the 2011 Summer Universiade, becoming the first Men's Ivy League Basketball World University Games participant since Bill Bradley. Jeremiah Kreisberg was named to the Israeli team for the FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship Division B held in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He played in 6 of the team's 8 games, leading the team in scoring and finishing second in rebounds. Preseason publications predicted Harvard would finish in first place. For the first time in school history, the Ivy League media panel selected Harvard as its first place choice. Princeton and Yale finished tied for second.\nSeason.\nBy returning all of their key players from the 2010–11 Ivy League co-champion 2010–11 Crimson and competing successfully, Harvard received votes in the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings polls every week until the final week of the season and was ranked for many weeks. Harvard represented the Ivy League by sweeping its three contests and emerging victorious in the 2011 Battle 4 Atlantis. Among the highlights of the season were victories by both Harvard and Princeton over eventual 2012 ACC men's basketball tournament champion Florida State. Zack Rosen finished the season as the Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year.\nFollowing the annual 14-game round robin home &amp; home schedule, Harvard emerged as champion and earned the conference's automatic bid to the 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.

        "title": "Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics",
        "text": "Rugby sevens was played at the Olympics for the first time at the 2016 Summer Olympics, with both men's and women's contests. It was added to the Olympics following the decision of the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen in October 2009. The champions for the inaugural rugby sevens tournament in 2016 were Fiji for the men and Australia for the women. Prior to 2016, 15-a-side matches were played in 1900, 1908, 1920, and 1924.\nEfforts to include rugby sevens in the Olympics.\n1932 bid.\nA Scottish man based in Canada, Mr. W. Hastie Cochrane, was unsuccessful in his bid to get rugby sevens into the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics: the reason given was that two exhibition sports had already been picked, namely American football and lacrosse. \n2012 bid.\nRugby sevens was one of five sports — golf, karate, roller sports, rugby, and squash — that submitted a proposal to the IOC at the 117th IOC Session meeting in Singapore in 2005 for inclusion in the 2012 games. The IOC stated that no sport would be added unless others were dropped. However, the selection of two sports out of the five nominees as potential 2012 sports went to squash and karate, as determined by a voting procedure.\n2016 bid.\nMost recently, rugby sevens competed with golf for two available spaces in the 2016 Olympics. The final decision was made at the IOC Session in Copenhagen in October 2009: the IRB used a number of high-profile people and events to influence the IOC to include sevens at the 2016 games. In March 2009, two senior delegates from the IOC attended the 2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Dubai at the invitation of the IRB.\nThe event attracted 78,000 fans over the three days and saw Wales crowned Men’s World Champions, while Australia won the first ever Women's World Cup.\nAlong with the World Cup, the IRB enlisted some of rugby’s biggest names to assist in the bid. In March 2009, Jonah Lomu and Lawrence Dallaglio were announced as ambassadors for the bid, and in April 2009 Waisale Serevi was unveiled as an ambassador to coincide with the Oceania National Olympic Committees' general assembly. May 2009 saw the IRB announce that they would drop the Rugby World Cup Sevens in order to improve the chances of the sport being included: the benefit of this move would be to make the Olympics the premier event in international rugby sevens.\nAs well as rugby sevens, baseball and softball (which were dropped from the Olympic programme in 2005), karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking to be included in the 2016 Games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system was in place from this session, in which a sport now needs only a simple majority for inclusion, rather than the previous two-thirds majority.\nOn 13 August 2009, it was announced that the IOC executive board was recommending rugby sevens for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games and on 9 October 2009 the full IOC, at its 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, voted to include rugby sevens in the 2016 games.\nSeparate competitions for men and women will be held, using a similar format to the existing IRB Sevens World Series.\nThe IRB had originally proposed including 12 teams of each sex, the same number as other team ball sports events. During the IRB's presentation at the IOC Session, two IOC members asked why only 12 teams were included: IRB Chief Executive Mike Miller responded \"We followed the guidance of the Executive Members of the IOC, but if the IOC feels we should have more teams, we will add more.\"\nQualifying.\nTwelve rugby teams participate in the men’s and women’s competitions, qualifying through one of the four following routes:\nCompetition format.\nBoth the men’s and women’s competition consist of two parts: pool play followed by a knockout round.\nFor pool play, the twelve teams are divided into three pools of four teams each. Each team plays the other three teams in the pool once.\nAt the end of pool play, the eight best teams — the top two from each group plus the two best third-place finishers — qualify for the quarterfinals, while the other four teams move to the semi-finals of a consolation bracket.\nThe knockout rounds proceed through the quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final. The losers of the quarter-finals move to the semi-finals of a second consolation bracket, while the winners proceed to the medal semi-finals. \nThe winner of the final wins the gold medal, and the defeated finalist wins silver, while the two defeated semifinalists play a third-place playoff to determine who wins the bronze medal.\nHistory.\n2016.\nThough rugby had not been featured in the Olympics since the 1924 Summer Olympics in any form, the IOC chose to introduce the seven-a-side version of the sport to the games. The seven-a-side version, completed over two or three days, involving squads of no more than 12 players and consisting of multiple 14 minute matches in one stadium was seen as particularly suitable format for multi-sport events. The sport featured for this Olympics and the following 2020 Summer Olympics. The sport was retained thereafter for 2024 in Paris and 2028 in Los Angeles, and is expected to be included in 2032 in Australia, a major rugby sevens nation.\nThe 2016 rugby competition took place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project. The Organising Committee considered Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which would have had to have been shared with the athletics competitions. It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns were raised by the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.\nThe competition ran from the August 6–11, taking a maximum six days. In the Men's tournament, pool A consisted of Fiji, Argentina, USA and Brazil. Pool B included South Africa, Australia, France and Spain while pool C consisted of New Zealand, Great Britain, Kenya and Japan. In the Women's tournament pool A consisted of Australia, USA, Fiji and Colombia. Pool B included New Zealand, France, Spain and Kenya while pool C consisted of Canada, Great Britain, Brazil and Japan.\nThe women's saw Australia beating New Zealand 24–17 in the first final of women's rugby union at the Olympic Games. New Zealand took the early lead but Australia fought back and looked the most dangerous team throughout. The New Zealand defence was brutal early. Australia had the ball for the first two minutes but there was just no way through. New Zealand eventually found a way through after five minutes through Kayla McAlister. Australia almost struck back two minutes later but brutal one-on-one New Zealand defence prevented the try. Finally Australia scored in the corner. The ball looked to be grassed early and then bobble over the line without Australian player Emma Tonegato being in control. But the five points went onto the scoreboard. They went on and scored again right on halftime through Evania Pelite. Australia made an awful start to the second half, kicking the ball out on the full. But they soon recovered with tries to Ellia Green and Charlotte Caslick.\nIn the men's tournament, Fiji secured their first Olympic medal with emphatic 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one and one with Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau was still able to stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji racked up a further five tries.\nThe introduction of rugby sevens, its traditional festival atmosphere and the victory of Fiji for their first ever Olympic medal, was seen as a significant success story of the Games, notwithstanding that rugby union was not considered a major sport in Brazil.\nCombined medal table.\nAccurate as of the conclusion of the 2020 Olympics."

        "text": "In water polo, the goalkeeper occupies a position as the last line of defense between the opponent's offence and their own team's goal, which is .\nThe goalkeeper position is unique; they possess certain privileges and are subject to different restrictions than those of field players. Accordingly , they possess different skills than those of the field players.\nGoalkeepers often have longer playing careers than field players because they need mental power rather than physical power.\nIn water polo, the goalkeeper is commonly known as the \"goalie\" or \"keeper\" and may also be known as \"the man/woman in the cage\".\nHistory.\nThe position of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, the object of the game was to touch the ball on the opponent's end of the pool. The goalkeeper would wait at the end of the pool until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.\nA change occurred in the game and the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.\nThe basic functions of the goalie position have changed little over the last century, but there have been changes affecting the style of play. In the 1940s, Hungary introduced a new technique called the eggbeater kick that enables goalkeepers to maintain a stable balance in the water.\nRules.\nFina Rules 2019/2021\nInside the area, the goalkeeper is the only person on the team permitted to touch the ball with two hands, touch the bottom of the pool and punch the ball with a clenched fist. The goalkeeper may advance beyond the half-way line, they may attempt shots at the other goal.\nAny goalkeeper who makes an aggressive foul on an attacker in within the area of the goalie's team is charged with a penalty shot for the other team. The goalkeeper can also be temporarily ejected from the game for twenty seconds if they make an ordinary foul within the goalie's area(for example, by splashing). If the goalkeeper then holds the ball under the water when challenged by an opponent; it is awarded a penalty to the opponent team. A penalty is also awarded to the other team to pull down or otherwise displace the goal at any time during the match.\nGoalkeeper's caps are usually numbered 1 or 1B and sometimes 15 and red colored to distinguish their position.\nRule variations.\nBelow is a table showing the major differences of rules and regulations for water polo goalkeepers between the latest changes made by the FINA.\nResponsibilities and techniques.\nIn water polo, field players possess entirely different skills and responsibilities to the goalkeeper.\nResponsibilities.\nThe primary role of the goalkeeper is to block shots at the goal. After saving the ball, the goalkeeper has the responsibility to keep possession of the ball in order to stop opposing players regaining possession. They must make sure that whenever the opposition appears to be ready to make a shot on goal, their hands are near or above the surface of the water. They also possess the job to pass down the pool accurately to retain possession of the ball, often starting the team's counterattack.\nThe goalkeeper is the only player who may block a penalty and because 63.7% of penalties are goals, the goalkeeper has a massive role in this area but failure to be in the correct position at a penalty is an exclusion foul. At a penalty shootout, the goalkeeper's job is critical and will largely determine the outcome of the match. If the goalkeeper is excluded during the course of the penalty shootout, then one of the other five players in the pool may take their place. The goalkeeper's hips should be high at a penalty shot to give them extra height. The goalkeeper should do one of two things at a penalty shot:\nMoreover, goalkeepers should have leadership. They should inform field players of information, such as unmarked players and the time of the game clock and give instructions to the field players. Because of this, they may sometimes be known as \"the coach in the water\".\nWhen a man down, goalkeepers have extra responsibility. It is easier for the other team to continue to shoot, making the goalkeeper very worn out. Platanou said that with a man down the goalkeeper had \"The highest possible intensity\".\nBody part techniques.\nMost of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water without too much effort) but when they do work (for example, when they have a man down or are in the ready position) it is very intense.\nGoalkeepers must be able to perform the eggbeater kick to a high standard. Before the eggbeater kick, goalkeepers would use breaststroke which meant that they could not stay up for very long and players found it easier to score. By using the eggbeater kick, goalkeepers can raise their bodies high enough in the water to be able to block shots at the goal for longer periods of time. This can be used conjunctively with sculling, in which the goalkeeper keeps their hands closed (with the fingers together) and moves them forwards and backwards.\nThe easiest way for the goalkeeper to block shots is for them to block the ball with either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports involving quick reactions may be helpful, as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.\nBody part work.\nTo improve, there are a variety of drills designed to improve the goalkeeper's skill.\nTo start with, there are drills to help improve the goalkeeper in the water. These range from simple exercise (such as jumping as high out of the water as possible with two hands) to drills not specifically used in water polo; rather they are used to improve the goalkeeper's core muscles (such as catching a ball dropped from the side into the water).\nAs the goalkeeper must be able to swim quickly for short distances, to improve they can practice exercises such as swimming quickly and then immediately stopping without touching the sides. It is important for the goalkeeper to swim both breastroke and freestyle – the breastroke helping with the eggbeater kick and the freestyle helping with the swimming in the match.\nMoreover, at the start of the game it is vital for the goalkeeper to stretch for 15 minutes.\nBlocking techniques.\nAs blocking the ball is the primary role of the goalkeeper, they must have good knowledge of blocking techniques.\nAs the goalkeeper has the choice of how many hands they want to use, the decision should be made of what they want to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go to the ball faster.\nGoalkeepers should be wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers to come out of the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player attempts to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.\nMost shots are saved with the arms or the hands, but goalkeepers are known to save shots with their faces and even feet.\n&lt;ref name=\"FINA Rules 2019/2021\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;"

Kevin Sinfield's sideline conversion was successful and the score was 6 nil. PNG responded with a try of their own seven minutes later when Rod Griffin, running a good line, received the ball from dummy half Paul Aiton and crashed over near the uprights. John Wilshere kicked the extras and with a quarter of the match gone the score was level at 6 all. In the twenty-sixth minute PNG's Jessie Joe Parker was taken from the field and subsequently to hospital with a suspected fractured eye socket. Two minutes later England were on the attack and spread it out wide to the left this time for Lee Smith who crossed for a try in his World Cup debut. Sinfield was again successful with his sideline conversion, making the score 12–6 in favour of the English with ten minutes of the first half remaining. The Kumuls however were dominating possession, making their opposition do a mountain of defence, and just after the 35-minute mark, while raiding England's line again, PNG's five-eighth, Stanley Gene (playing in his third consecutive World Cup), threw a cut-out pass to Jason Chan that saw him cross untouched for Papua New Guinea's second try. Wilshere's conversion made the scores level once again. With a minute until the half-time siren Kumuls halfback Keith Peters sent a high kick across-field which England couldn't secure and it bounced up for winger George Kepa who put it down in the corner. The video referee ruled it was a try and Wilshere's attempt at goal from the sideline was missed so Papua New Guinea went into the half-time break leading 16–12.\nLess than seven minutes into the second half Papua New Guinea crossed England's line again but the try was disallowed by Shane Hayne for a slightly forward pass. England were the first to score with Smith crossing from close range in the fifty-first minute to pick up his second try and level the scores again. Sinfield's conversion attempt was unsuccessful, leaving the score at 16 all. The English however, with the weight of possession, raided the Kumuls' line repeatedly and scored again in the 58th minute with halfback Rob Burrow dummying wide before passing back inside for Martin Gleeson to go over untouched from close range. This gave England the lead once more and Sinfield converted the try, pushing the margin out to six points with just over a quarter of the match remaining. With Papua New Guinea struggling to get out of their own half, England's Danny McGuire sent his winger Smith over the try-line once again, but the pass was ruled to have been forward. However, in the seventieth minute, England worked the ball to the other wing and Gardner crossed out wide for his second try off what appeared to be a forward pass from Leon Pryce. Sinfield's boot added the extras to give England the biggest lead of the match so far at 28–16. Three minutes later, now back on the other wing, England made a break and got the ball to Smith who crossed again. The video referee was required to check the grounding as PNG's fullback Wilshere had gotten his arm between the ground and the ball, but the try was awarded, giving Smith a hat-trick. Sinfield's conversion attempt was wide but England had scored twenty unanswered points in the second half and had a comfortable lead at 32–16 with only six minutes to play left. This would not be the final score however, as from the restart Papua New Guinea went for the short kick-off and successfully re-gathered, going on the attack. On the last tackle Peters sent a grubber through and Aiton dived on it for the Kumuls' fourth try. Wilshere's conversion put the final score at 32–22.\n&lt;section begin=ENGvPNG /&gt;&lt;section end=ENGvPNG /&gt;\nAustralia vs New Zealand.\nAlthough this was actually the second World Cup match to be played, it featured the tournament's opening ceremony as it was the first game featuring hosts Australia and was played in Sydney.\nThe first points of the match came from a penalty kick by Johnathan Thurston (playing despite the murder of his uncle the previous day in a Brisbane park) after New Zealand's Simon Mannering held Brett Stewart down for too long in a tackle at the 9-minute mark. Three minutes later the Kiwis were again penalised in their own territory when Steve Matai's swinging arm struck Paul Gallen in the head, the incident being placed on report. Australia opted to attack New Zealand's line and the first try of the match went to Greg Inglis who beat his opposite number Matai to dive over. Thurston's successful conversion gave the Kangaroos an 8 nil lead. Later as the Kiwis were on the attack, second-rower Sika Manu, playing his debut match for New Zealand, ran an inside line onto a Benji Marshall short ball and found a way through the middle of Australia's defence to touch down near the uprights just on 27 minutes. Matai's conversion brought the margin back to two points. Shortly after however, Australia struck back through debutant winger Joel Monaghan whose try was awarded by the on-field referee after the video official referred the decision back to him. Thurston's conversion gave the Kangaroos a 14–6 lead going into the half-time break.\nAustralia were again the first to score in the second half, this time on the right side, with Israel Folau's arm reaching out over one of his tacklers at the goal-line to plant the ball down in the 48th minute. Thurston missed his first kick of the night so the score was 18–6. Ten minutes later Brent Tate was being taken from the field with a neck injury just before the Australian halfback Thurston made a break mid-field and, as he was being brought to the ground by a defender, threw the ball back for Billy Slater to regather and score. Thurston then kicked the extras, pushing Australia's lead out to three converted tries with just under a quarter of the match remaining. With less than three minutes of game time left the Kiwis looked to have scored a consolation try when Jerome Ropati crashed over out wide, the decision being put to the video referee. The replay however showed that the Australian fullback, Slater, had slid across in desperation feet-first, knocking the ball from Ropati's grasp with his boot just before he could touch it to the ground. In the final seconds of the match Australia scored one more try when quick hands from Slater flicked the ball out wide for Folau who dived over for his second. Cameron Smith was assigned the conversion from the side-line and was successful, giving the Kangaroos a 30–6 victory.\n&lt;section begin=AUSvNZL /&gt;&lt;section end=AUSvNZL /&gt;\nNew Zealand vs Papua New Guinea.\nIn the second week of the tournament, Group A's New Zealand and Papua New Guinea faced off at Queensland's Gold Coast. It was the first time the two countries had met since the Kiwis had a 64-0 win over the Kumuls at Palmerston North in 1996. Papua New Guinea made no changes to their side from the previous match, while New Zealand were without Steve Matai who was serving a suspension due to his high tackle on Australia's Paul Gallen in their previous match. This meant Krisnan Inu got his chance to play, and Sika Manu and Dene Halatau were also replaced by Isaac Luke and David Fa'alogo.\nThe first points came in the ninth minute when New Zealand, from fifteen metres out, moved the ball through the hands from the right side of the field out to the left, catching PNG's defence outnumbered so Jermoe Ropati could crossed untouched. Krisnan Inu's conversion attempt missed, leaving the score at 4 nil. Less than four minutes later it was Ropati again who fell over PNG's line, but was held up in goal. In the sixteenth minute the Kiwis again moved the ball out wide through the hands, this time to the right side where Simon Mannering was able to pass untouched between the thinly stretched defence to score. Inu kicked the extras and New Zealand were leading 10 nil. Mannering scored his second try eight minutes later, again on the right side of the field, after taking on the defensive line and breaking through. Inu's conversion was successful, taking New Zealand's lead out to 16 nil with fourteen minutes of the first half remaining. New Zealand's defence then withstood a series of assaults on their line when Papua New Guinea got repeat sets. Back in the Kumuls' half though, the Kiwis scored in the thirty-fourth minute, again on the right wing, when Benji Marshall threw an enormous cut out pass over to Sam Perrett who jogged over unchallenged by PNG's severely outnumbered defence. Inu's conversion made it 22 unanswered points by New Zealand and this would remain the scoreline at the half time break.\nMarshall, New Zealand's key play maker, sat out the second half to ice a tightened hamstring muscle and after seven minutes it was Papua New Guinea who got the first points. On the left side of the field Neville Costigan got a pass out of a tackle to Jessie Joe Parker who also managed to pass from a tackle back inside for winger David Moore to race through some defenders and over the try-line, improving his kicker's field position by putting the ball down behind the uprights. Wilshere's simple conversion made the score 22–6. In the fifty-sixth minute, New Zealand returned to their try-scoring ways when Isaac Luke ran from dummy half thirty-seven metres out from Papua New Guinea's line and evaded a few defenders to score. Inu, however, missed the simple conversion. The Kiwis crossed again in the fifty-ninth minute from close range, Fa'alogo receiving a short ball from Fien and barging over the line. Isaac Luke missed the conversion so the score was 30–6 with a quarter of the match remaining. Less than ten minutes later, Adam Blair scored in the same spot, taking a short ball from dummy half Leuluai at close range and crashing over. Inu, making a return to the goal-kicking job, successfully converted the try. In the seventy-first minute, New Zealand were attacking again when Luke kicked high and to the left wing. Inu leapt for it but couldn't catch the ball and it ricocheted off the PNG defence before coming down for Sam Perrett to regather and ground. After examination by the video referee of a possible New Zealand knock on, the try was awarded due to the benefit of the doubt. Inu's conversion attempt was successful, bringing the score to 42–6. The Kiwis got one more try in the match when Greg Eastwood ran the ball from over thirty metres out, stepping and brushing past some defenders to score under the posts. The extras were kicked by Inu, leaving the final score at 48–6.\nThe loss for Papua New Guinea effectively ended their hopes of making the semi-finals, now requiring a win over Australia by an enormous margin to do so.\n&lt;section begin=NZLvPNG /&gt;&lt;section end=NZLvPNG /&gt;\nAustralia vs England.\n&lt;section begin=AUSvENG /&gt;&lt;section end=AUSvENG /&gt;\nEngland vs New Zealand.\nThe last time the New Zealand and England sides met was in the semi-final of the 2000 World Cup, with the Kiwis winning 49 to 6. So far in this tournament both sides had defeated Papua New Guinea and lost to Australia. Changes to the New Zealand side were: Jason Nightingale in for Sam Perrett on the right wing; Steve Matai, after serving his one-match suspension, regained his place at right centre from Krisnan Inu; Evarn Tuimivave replaced Nathan Cayless in the front row (with Benji Marshall being named captain); David Fa'alogo was moved from the bench into Setaimata Sa's spot in the second row; Sam Rapira was dropped with David Kidwell and Bronson Harrison added to the bench.\nEngland were the first to score after getting repeat sets which took them down close to New Zealand's line where hooker Mickey Higham pushed through the defence from dummy half in the 4th minute. The simple conversion was kicked by Rob Purdham so the score was 6 nil. Less than 4 minutes later England were working the ball out from their own 10-metre line when they decided to pass out wide to their centre Keith Senior, who beat the defence and raced down along the left wing. He then passed back inside for Rob Burrow running up in support and the diminutive halfback was away for England's second try. Purdham's conversion was successful so England were in front 12 nil with under ten minutes of the match gone. However New Zealand struck back just on 13 minutes after a break made by centre Jerome Ropati from a scrum win mid-field afforded Manu Vatuvei a run at the disorganised defence from within ten metres, the giant winger barging his way over for his first try of the tournament. The conversion attempt by Steve Matai was wide, so the score remained 12–4 in favour of England. At the sixteen-minute mark from a scrum win the English , Martin Gleeson made a sudden break from 30 metres out and was into open space, his run good enough for the momentum to drag him and his tackler over the try-line. The video referee awarded the four points and Purdham kicked the extra two so England's lead was pushed out to 18–4. In the 20th minute, the Kiwis were down close to the English try-line when New Zealand fullback Lance Hohaia dummied and stepped his way through the defensive line and fought his way through his tacklers to force the ball down, the video referee awarding the try after some deliberation. The kick from Matai missed so the score was 18–8 with three quarters of the match still remaining. Six minutes later, England were back deep in New Zealand's territory when Burrow at first-receiver and on the last tackle stepped and dashed through the defence to score his second try of the night. Purdham's conversion put the score at England 24, New Zealand 8. A few minutes later play was halted while Kiwi centre Steve Matai was taken from the field after falling into a tackle awkwardly and injuring his neck. New Zealand, ten metres into England's half and before the first tackle of a new set of six, offloaded from some tackles and kept the ball alive before sending it out to Jason Nightingale on the right wing where he dived over in the corner. Isaac Luke was given the sideline conversion attempt and kicked it, putting New Zealand back in the contest at 24–14, with three minutes of the first half remaining. No more points were scored before the break.\nIn the 47th minute, New Zealand were on the attack and were the first to score in the second half when a long pass from Hohaia out to Vatuvei saw him dive over untouched in the left corner for his second try of the match. The video referee awarded the try and Luke's sideline conversion attempt was wide, so the score was New Zealand 18, England 24. The Kiwi's then continued dominating possession and field position and in the 55th minute Vatuvei scored his 3rd, again diving over untouched in the corner after receiving a long ball from Hohaia. Once more Luke had to kick for goal from the sideline and this time was successful so the scores were level at 24 all. In the 69th minute, Luke gained his team a penalty when he was given a push by an England player while running in to contest a bomb and fell to the ground. The Kiwis decided to take the kick from in front of the posts and Luke got the two points which put New Zealand in the lead for the first time at 26–24. New Zealand were attacking England's line again in the 75th minute when an English defender fumbled an intercept chance and from the confusion Nathan Fein, who was playing on despite a broken nose, picked up the ball and crashed over. The try was awarded by the video referee and the conversion was kicked by Jeremy Smith, so New Zealand led 32 to 24 with 5 minutes of the match remaining. The Kiwis got one more try, again from Lance Hohaia throwing a long ball out to Manu Vatuvei to cross untouched on the left wing once more, his fourth try for the night. Benji Marshall took the sideline conversion attempt and missed, but the game was already beyond doubt, with New Zealand winning 36–24.\nManu Vatuvei's four tries saw him break the record of three previously held by Robbie Paul and Lesley Vainikolo for most tries in a World Cup match by a New Zealand player.\n&lt;section begin=ENGvNZL /&gt;&lt;section end=ENGvNZL /&gt;\nAustralia vs Papua New Guinea.\nThe last time these two teams had met was in 2001 at Port Moresby when Australia defeated Papua New Guinea by 42 points, and it was their first World Cup match since 1992. Papua New Guinea's place in the tournament was at stake, with a win by more than 2 points required. The Kangaroos' undefeated run so far had guaranteed their place in the play-offs so they could afford to experiment with the player lineup for this match. Captain Darren Lockyer and star fullback Billy Slater were rested while four of the Australians were to make their international debuts: Terry Campese taking Lockyer's place at five-eighth, Darius Boyd, David Williams and Anthony Watmough. Karmichael Hunt took Slater's place at fullback.\nAustralia opened the scoring in the ninth minute when Johnathan Thurston kicked across-field from close range for winger David Williams, making his international debut, to leap for and score in the right corner. Thurston then converted the try so the score was 6 nil. Just over two minutes later Williams crossed in the corner again after receiving a long ball from Karmichal Hunt which was ruled to be forward, so no try was given. Terry Campese, making his debut for Australia was forced to leave the field after receiving a poke in the eye. Australia were attacking close to PNG's line again in the twenty-second minute when the ball was moved out to the other wing where Joel Monaghan forced his way over. The video referee ruled that he'd got the ball down, and after Thurston's second successful kick from near the sideline, this time the left one, the score was 12 nil in favour of the Kangaroos. Less than three minutes later, Australia were again up on the Kumuls' line when quick hands got the ball out to Monaghan and he dived over in the corner untouched for his second try. Thurston's kicking accuracy from difficult angles continued so The Kangaroos had 18 unanswered points. Slick passing before PNG's line resulted in Australia's fourth try as well, this time out to the right for David Williams to cross untouched. Thurston missed his fourth sideline conversion of the night, so the score was 22 nil with three minutes of the first half remaining. No more points were scored before the break.\nAfter holding out Australia's first raid on their line successfully, Papua New Guinea were about to start working their way back up the field when they conceded an easy try to Scott Prince who rushed up to intercept a Stanley Gene pass to score under the posts. Thurston's kick was simple so the score was 28 nil after forty-three minutes. Ten minutes later Australia scored again after keeping the ball alive close to the Kumuls' line, Prince crossing untouched again for his second try. Thurston again kicked the extra two points so the score was 34 nil with twenty-five minutes of the match remaining. In the seventieth minute the Australians, while in their own half, moved the ball out to the right where Williams got it and ran forty metres to score his third try. In doing so he became only the third Kangaroo since Lionel Morgan in 1960 and Brad Mackay in 1990 to score a hat-trick on debut for Australia. Thurston kicked another sideline conversion so it was 40 nil. Papua New Guinea's kick-off was short and they successfully regained the ball. After working their way up into an attacking position close to the Kangaroos' try-line, Ron Griffin put in the perfect grubber kick behind the defence for Menzie Yere to run through and dive on. Wiltshere converted successfully so the score was 40–6 in favour of the home side. Australia scored one more try a few minutes later when Anthony Tupou ran onto a short pass from close range to put the ball down behind the posts. Thurston's kick made the final score 46–6.\nThe match was the last international for Stanley Gene, the only player to have played in the last three World Cups, who was chaired from the field by his teammates.\n&lt;section begin=AUSvPNG /&gt;&lt;section end=AUSvPNG /&gt;"

At stake was the chance to play Australia in the semi-final. Fiji had lost prop Iowane Divavesi to a two-match ban for tripping just hours before the match.\nAmhrán na bhFiann was performed as the Ireland team's national anthem before the match. Fiji opened the scoring early with their captain Wes Naiqama from the half way line finding space down the right side of the field and scoring on the 2-minute mark. He then converted his own try so the score was 6–0. About 5 minutes later Ireland responded with their own 50-metre runaway try down the right side thanks to winger Damien Blanch. Pat Richards kicked the extras so the scores were level at 6–6. In the 25th minute Fiji were penalised just over 40 metres out from their own line and the Irish decided to take the shot at goal. Richards' attempt went wide so the score remained unchanged. Fiji scored again about five minutes later when from close-range, Akuila Uate ran from dummy half on his wing infield to find a gap in the defence and score near the uprights. Naiqama's conversion was successful so Fiji led 12 - 6. It was Ireland's turn to score again and they did so in the 46th minute when from within Fiji's 10-metre line, captain Scott Grix decided to run from first receiver, charging through a gap and getting the ball down. Richards' kick to level the scores hit the upright and missed, so Fiji remained two points ahead at 12 - 10 and this was the score until half-time.\nAbout a minute into the second half Fiji were up at their opponents' try-line when hooker James Storer ran from dummy half and crashed over but was held up by the defence. After repeated raids on the Irish try-line and despite some enormous drop-outs from Pat Richards, Fiji kept on coming and scored just on 55 minutes, when from close range Jason Bukuya found a gap in the defence and reached out to plant the ball down. Naiqama's conversion was successful so Fiji led 18 - 10. A few minutes later Fiji were again down close to Ireland's try-line when they got a penalty for a ruck infringement. Naiqama decided to take the shot at goal and didn't miss, so the score was 20 - 10 in favour of Fiji with seventeen minutes left on the clock. Ireland continued to be under siege and 10 metres out from their line, Fiji's halfback Aaron Groom stabbed a kick in behind the defence for Jarryd Hayne to chase and put down after clipping one of the uprights in his haste in the 66th minute. The video referee awarded the try and Naiqama kicked the simple conversion so Fiji had a comfortable lead at 26 - 10. Ten minutes later Fiji scored again after continuing to attack Ireland's line, this time Uate crossing out wide on the right wing. Naiqama's kick from the sideline hit the upright and missed, so with just over 5 minutes of the game remaining, the score was 30 - 10. Ireland got one more chance to attack Fiji's line in the closing minutes and it was Blanch who scored for them again, benefiting from a good offload from Lee Doran close to the try-line. Richards missed the conversion attempt so the final score was Fiji 30, Ireland 14. The Bati would play Australia next, with the winner of that match going to the World Cup final, while the Irish exited the tournament with A$75,000 prize money.\n&lt;section begin=FIJvIRE/&gt;&lt;section end=FIJvIRE/&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nSemi-final 1: New Zealand vs England.\nIn a re-play of both sides' last match, New Zealand once again faced England, this time for the right to play in the World Cup final. English coach Tony Smith left it to within an hour of kick-off before naming his team for the match. Kevin Sinfield was dropped from his position on the bench. Ben Westwood was promoted from the bench to the run-on side. For New Zealand Jason Nightingale was replaced by Sam Perrett. Sika Manu's faster than expected recovery from an eye socket injury saw his return with David Kidwell dropped in his place.\nNo British side had won a test match in Brisbane since Wales had defeated England at Lang Park during the 1975 World Cup. New Zealand had lost their last 8 international matches in the city.\nThis time when the Kiwis performed their haka, the England side stood in a line ten metres away and faced them.\nIn the ninth minute New Zealand were on the attack courtesy of a mistake from England and got the first try of the match, passing to Sam Perrett on the right wing who crossed out wide, then improved his kicker's position before putting the ball down. Jeremy Smith's conversion was successful so England trailed 6–nil. England, also benefitting from some New Zealand mistakes, were attacking the Kiwis' line and threw the ball out wide to the right wing as well and Ade Gardner dived over in the corner just before the fifteen-minute mark. The video referee showed that Gardner's toe touched the sideline before he grounded the ball so the try was not given. Four minutes later the Kiwis were back down at England's end when Lance Hohaia got over for a close-range try. Smith's kick went wide so the score was 10–nil in favour of New Zealand with a quarter of the match gone. Rob Purdham's restart kick went over the sideline on the full so New Zealand got the ball back and in the following set of six they scored again through Jerome Ropati. Smith's kick was good this time, so the Kiwis had 16 unanswered points. Then in the twenty-ninth minute England had an opportunity in attack down at New Zealand's end and kept the ball alive, the ball going to captain Jamie Peacock who forced his way over from close range. Purdham missed the conversion attempt so the score remained 16–4 in favour of the Kiwis. A New Zealand knock-on less than two minutes from half time saw the English get a scrum a few metres into the opposition's half. In a bold set move from the scrum base, England's loose forward Purdham broke away with the ball and immediately kicked it ahead for Danny Maguire racing through to regather and dive over by the goal posts. The video referee ruled that the chaser was only just in line with the kicker so the try was awarded. Rob Burrow was given the conversion attempt and kicked it, so England were back within a converted try at 16–10 at the half-time break.\nAfter a few minutes of the second half, England second-rower Gareth Ellis was forced from the field with a rib injury. Both sides had attacking opportunities during the first 16 minutes of the half, but it was New Zealand's Bronson Harrison who scored first after receiving a good short ball from halfback Nathan Fien on England's twenty metre line which saw him cut through the defence, step past the fullback and score by the uprights. Smith's conversion meant the score was New Zealand 22, England 10 with twenty-two minutes of the match remaining. After a bomb from England which Hohaia failed to take securely, England were on the attack again. They moved the ball out through the hands to the right, and centre Martin Gleeseon dragged himself through the defence to reach out and score in the sixty-first minute. Burrow kicked the sideline conversion so England were back within a converted try of New Zealand at 22–16. The Kiwis then got repeat sets down near England's line and were the next to score: Fien kicked the ball over towards the goal posts and as it came down in-goal two English defenders failed to secure it and Jerome Ropati was there to fall onto it. Benji Marshall was given the conversion this time and kicked it successfully so the score was 28–16 with ten minutes to go. Three minutes later England gave themselves a glimmer of hope when Maguire found space between New Zealand's defence and ran through it from fifteen metres out to score by the posts. Burrow's conversion meant that England were back within six points with six minutes of the game left to go. However the English were let down by further handling errors and New Zealand were the last to score after England again failed to defend against a bomb out to the left, Marshall putting it down in the corner at the 78th minute, placing the game beyond doubt. Smith missed the sideline conversion so the final score was 32–22. England then went home with A$130,000 prize money and New Zealand had booked a place in the final the following week.\n&lt;section begin=NZLvENG/&gt;&lt;section end=NZLvENG/&gt;\nSemi-final 2: Australia vs Fiji.\n&lt;section begin=AUSvFIJ/&gt;&lt;section end=AUSvFIJ/&gt;"

        "text": "This is a record of Poland's results at the FIFA World Cup. They have qualified for the finals on nine occasions, most recently in 2022. The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nIn World Cup history, Poland has participated in nine World Cup editions, started with the 1938 World Cup where they lost to Brazil in a 5–6 thriller. It took Poland thirty-six years later to qualify for another World Cup, where they began to stun the world from eliminating former world champions England in 1974 qualification, to finishing third twice, in 1974 and 1982 editions. After participating in 1986, Poland started to decline and lost momentum in global football.\nSince the fall of communist rule in Poland at 1989, Poland managed to qualify for 2002, 2006 and 2018 FIFA World Cups, but the team was unable to repeat the feat of the predecessors, went out from the group stage in all three tournaments with two opening losses before gained a consolidating win in the last match. In 2022, Poland, for the first time since 1986, didn't begin the tournament with a defeat, after holding Mexico goalless, and ultimately went on to advance to the knockout stage for the first time in 36 years.\nMatch records.\n1938 FIFA World Cup.\nFirst round\n1974 FIFA World Cup.\nSecond group stage.\nThird place playoff\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage\nRound of 16\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage\n2018 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage\n2022 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup stage\nKnockout stage\nRecord players.\nWładysław Żmuda, who participated in all four World Cups of Poland's Golden Generation, also holds the shared record as player with the most FIFA World Cup matches without ever winning the trophy. He is tied with Paolo Maldini and Uwe Seeler, but is the only one of those three from a country that has never won the World Cup, either.\nTop goalscorers.\nErnst Wilimowski was the first player ever to score four goals in one match at a FIFA World Cup, and to this day is the only player who managed this feat and still lost the match."

Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.\nThe NCAA recognizes two different All-America selectors for the 1987 college baseball season: the American Baseball Coaches Association (since 1947) and \"Baseball America\" (since 1981)."

        "text": "Kerry Clark (born August 21, 1968) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, notable as one of the most penalized players in minor league history.\nPersonal life.\nClark was born and raised in Saskatchewan, the youngest of three hockey-playing brothers. His oldest brother, Wendel Clark, starred in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Quebec Nordiques. Another brother, Donn Clark, was a player and coach for the Western Hockey League Saskatoon Blades, and passed away from cancer in 2019.\nHistory.\nJunior career.\nClark began his major junior career in 1984 with the Regina Pats of the Western Hockey League. Seeing minimal action his first two seasons, he was traded in the middle of the 85-86 season to the Saskatoon Blades, the team for which both his older brothers had played. Joining a squad with a number of notably rough players - his teammates included Kelly Chase, Tony Twist and Kevin Kaminski - he skated a more regular shift and played credibly for the Blades for two and a half seasons.\nProfessional career.\nDrafted in the tenth round of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Islanders, Clark reported to their minor league affiliate, the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, for the 1989 season. Playing for a team which won more fights than games, Clark's hardnosed style made him a fan favorite in Springfield. Aside from his fighting prowess - - although he scored only seven goals that season, he became noted for performing the Michael Jackson \"moonwalk\" on the ice after scoring a goal, first seen in a training camp exhibition match against the New York Rangers, a habit that throughout his career proved as unpopular with opposing players as it was popular with hometown fans.\nThe following season, a more powerful Indians team that went on to win the 1990 Calder Cup championship had little room for Clark, and he finished the year with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League, amassing 262 penalty minutes in only 38 games. He remained in the IHL for the next three seasons, with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. Clark played his best seasons in Utah, averaging 13 goals a year.\nClark returned to the AHL with the Portland Pirates, signing a minor league deal, in 1993, playing two seasons with that club as one of the \"Bruise Brothers\" before moving on to the Orlando Solar Bears of the IHL in 1995. Clark finished his career with the Milwaukee Admirals of the IHL in 1998, retiring after a vicious hit left him with a broken neck that almost paralyzed him.\nClark retired as one of the most penalized players of all time; he is 15th in International Hockey League history in penalty minutes and remains in the top 60 in minor league history in penalty minutes with 2812. Post playing career, he has spent time since as a hockey coach, first as Head Coach of the OCN Blizzard of the MJHL, followed by being an assistant coach for the Prince George Cougars of the WHL in the mid-2000s."

        "text": "The Western Australian Open, also known as the WA Open, is a golf tournament on the PGA Tour of Australasia. It had been a tour event every year since 2009 with the exception of 2019.\nHistory.\nThe first Western Australian Amateur Championship was held in 1911. This consisted of a 36-hole stroke-play qualification stage, played in a single day, followed by match-play to determine the champion. The leading four players in the stroke-play qualified in 1911, increasing to 8 in 1912. In 1913 the stroke-play stage was opened up to professionals, becoming the first Western Australian Open Championship. It was played at the Fremantle links on 28 August, nearly 30 players competing. In both 1911 and 1912, Norman Fowlie had led the stroke-play stage but in 1913 he was challenged by Clyde Pearce, who had won both the Australian Open and Australian Amateur in 1908, as well as losing the final three times in the amateur. Pearce won the Open with rounds of 77 and 78, three ahead of Fowlie who had rounds of 83 and 75. P. C. Anderson came third. The leading professional, David Dakers, came seventh. Pearce would go on to win the amateur championship as well.\nThe 1914 championship was again played on the Fremantle links in late August. Norman Fowlie reversed the 1913 result, winning by three strokes from Clyde Pearce, with rounds of 80 and 77. Two professionals entered but were well down the field.\nAlthough the state amateur championship resumed in 1919, it was until not 1921 that the open championship was played again. Reg Forbes won with a score of 160. Three players tied for second place on 161, Arthur Geere, Percy Maunder and John Walker. Maunder won a prize of 5 guineas as leading professional, although a £10 prize was available for a professional winner. 1922 saw the first professional winner, Maunder's score of 161 beating Geere by a stroke. Maunder took the £10 first prize.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "title": "Ice hockey in Saskatchewan",
        "text": "Ice hockey is among the most popular sports in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, and the province has been notable for producing a large number of hockey figures in both men's and women's hockey. Saskatchewan does not currently have a professional hockey team of its own, but it is home to a large number of junior and senior hockey teams. The sport is governed in the province by Hockey Saskatchewan.\nBeginnings.\nSaskatchewan became a province in 1905, but Canadian settlement in the region began decades earlier and by the 1890s ice hockey was becoming established as a popular pastime in the area. The first recorded organized games occurred in 1894, and teams were soon established in communities like Saskatoon, Regina, Moose Jaw, and Prince Albert. The Saskatchewan Amateur Hockey Association was established in 1906. Saskatchewan teams had some success on the early national amateur circuit with the Regina Victorias winning the 1914 Allan Cup, followed by the Melville Millionaires in 1915.\nSaskatchewan hockey players.\nSaskatchewan is notable for producing more than 500 National Hockey League (NHL) players throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the most per capita of any Canadian province, American state, or European country. It is common for small towns around the province to have highway signs listing local NHL players. Saskatchewan hockey products include Gordie Howe from Floral, dubbed \"Mr. Hockey\" and widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Howe played 26 seasons in the NHL, mostly with the Detroit Red Wings, won the Stanley Cup four times, and upon his retirement held league records for most career goals and points, records that were eventually broken by Wayne Gretzky. Today, there is a bridge and sports complex named after Howe in Saskatoon, a statue of Howe stationed outside of the city's SaskTel Centre arena, and a major bridge between Windsor and Detroit named after him under construction.\nSome other notable men's players from Saskatchewan include Max Bentley, one of six hockey-playing brothers who won the Hart Trophy in 1946 as NHL MVP and three Stanley Cups with the Toronto Maple Leafs; Johnny Bower, who twice won the Vezina Trophy as best goaltender and won four Stanley Cups with the Maple Leafs; Clark Gillies, a former captain of the New York Islanders who won four consecutive Stanley Cups with the team from 1980-1983 and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002; Bryan Trottier, who was part of the same Islanders dynasty; and Patrick Marleau, who won two Olympic gold medals with Canada and played 23 NHL seasons, surpassing Howe for the most games played in league history in 2021. Another prominent figure from Saskatchewan is Mike Babcock, who won a Stanley Cup as coach of the Red Wings in 2008 and also coached Team Canada to Olympic gold at both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics. Dave King and Willie Desjardins are two other former players who coached Canada at the Olympics, as well as in the NHL. Some other Hall of Fame men's players from Saskatchewan include Fernie Flaman, Bert Olmstead, Bernie Federko, Elmer Lach, Sid Abel, Glenn Hall, Eddie Shore, Bryan Hextall, Clint Smith, and Emile Francis in the Builder category. Ryan Getzlaf and Chris Kunitz both won Olympic gold medals with Team Canada, while Jordan Eberle scored one of Canada's most iconic goals at the 2009 World Junior Championships. Fred Sasakamoose has been honoured as a trailblazer for First Nations hockey players.\nMany prominent women's players have also come from Saskatchewan. Hayley Wickenheiser was the first female skater to play full-time professional hockey in a men's league and is regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. She helped lead Team Canada to five Olympic finals, winning four gold medals. Wickenheiser frequently captained the national team and became its all time leading scorer at the 2010 Olympics. She was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019. Other notable women players from Saskatchewan include three-time Olympic gold medalist Colleen Sostorics, two-time Olympic gold medalist Gina Kingsbury, and Emily Clark, who helped Canada win Olympic gold in 2022. In 2023, Clark became one of the first women ever signed to a contract in the Professional Women's Hockey League, signing with PWHL Ottawa; Clark would be one of four Saskatchewan women playing in the PWHL's inaugural six-team season. Shannon Miller coached Canada to a gold medal at the 1997 Women's World Championship and silver at the 1998 Olympics.\nProfessional hockey.\nEarly history.\nProfessional hockey existed in Saskatchewan as early as the 1910s. The Prince Albert Mintos went professional in 1911 and lost a series against the Port Arthur Bearcats for the opportunity to challenge the Stanley Cup champion Ottawa Senators. The Western Canada Hockey League was the prairie equivalent of the National Hockey League and began in the winter of 1921; its champion played the winner of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association to determine who would represent the West in the Stanley Cup finals. The Saskatoon Sheiks and Regina Capitals were among the founding franchises in the WCHL. During the league's inaugural season in 1921–22, the Sheiks moved to Moose Jaw; they returned to Saskatoon the following season under a new name, the Crescents, and then reverted to the Sheiks name ahead of the 1923–24 season. The Regina Capitals moved to Portland after the 1924–25 season, leaving the Sheiks as the only Saskatchewan team in the league. The WCHL folded after the 1925–26 season, with some of its teams and players being sold to create expansion NHL franchises. What remained of the Sheiks and Capitals, and a new team in Moose Jaw, played for two seasons in the new semi-professional Prairie Hockey League before it, too, folded, leaving Saskatchewan devoid of professional hockey for more than two decades. The Sheiks, playing out of Saskatoon's Crescent Arena, won the final Prairie Hockey League title in 1928.\nThe Saskatoon Quakers, a veteran senior team based out of Saskatoon Arena—which, upon opening in 1937, featured an exhibition game between the NHL's New York Rangers and New York Americans—joined the minor-professional Pacific Coast Hockey League in 1951, capturing the PCHL championship in 1951–52 before folding in 1956 due to the financial demands of running a professional team. The 1957–58 season saw the Brandon Regals team re-branded as the Saskatoon/St. Paul Regals, which split games between Saskatoon and Saint Paul, Minnesota. This novel experiment lasted one season; in 1958, the team hosted games only in Saskatoon and adopted the old Quakers name. They played just one more season before folding in 1959. The brothers Reg, Doug, and Max Bentley from Delisle were famous hockey players that played with the Quakers.\nCourting a team.\nAlthough no professional hockey team has operated in Saskatchewan since 1959, interest in bringing a major professional franchise to the province has persisted. Moreover, Saskatoon native \"Wild\" Bill Hunter was an instrumental figure in the founding of the World Hockey Association in 1971, which ultimately merged with the NHL in 1979. Hunter became driven to bring the NHL to Saskatoon, and his first plan involved pursuing the re-location of a struggling WHA franchise to Saskatoon in hopes of having it included in that merger. However, this effort came to nothing due to opposition from other WHA owners concerned that the inclusion of a Saskatoon franchise would upset the delicate merger negotiations with the NHL, as well as Hunter's inability to get a commitment for a new facility to replace the small and aging Saskatoon Arena. Following the merger, Hunter made another attempt in 1983 when he purchased the struggling St. Louis Blues with a plan to re-locate the franchise to Saskatoon. Although this time Hunter would secure commitments for 18,000 season tickets and a new arena in downtown Saskatoon, the NHL blocked the sale and re-location and an owner willing to keep the Blues in St. Louis was found.\nFollowing the completion of the new Saskatchewan Place arena, an ownership group including Hunter applied for a Saskatoon-based franchise to join the NHL as part of the league's early 1990s expansion. The group reportedly raised $50 million for the bid, but were turned down by the province for the final $20 million required and withdrew the bid. The prospect that an NHL franchise might still come to Saskatchewan persisted after the league regularly included Saskatchewan Place as a venue for a series of neutral site games included as part of the league's expanded 84 game schedule starting with the 1992–93 NHL season. However, the league scrapped the neutral site games after reverting to an 82-game schedule following the 1994-95 NHL lockout, and serious interest in bringing an NHL team to Saskatchewan declined through the latter half of the 1990s and the 2000s after the re-locations of the original Winnipeg Jets and Quebec Nordiques to American cities appeared to offer ample evidence that an NHL franchise in Saskatchewan could not be financially viable, especially while the Canadian dollar traded at a significant discount to the U.S. dollar.\nA number of changed circumstances in the first decade of the twenty-first century, including the introduction of a salary cap following the 2004-05 NHL lockout, a return of the exchange rate to parity, a relatively strong provincial economy, and reports of a number of U.S. franchises struggling led to speculation that Saskatchewan would again attempt to acquire an NHL franchise. Following the NHL takeover of the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes, a Canadian-American ownership group called Ice Edge Holdings that was negotiating to purchase the Coyotes announced their intention to play a limited number of Coyotes home games in Saskatoon as part of an overall plan to keep the team based in Arizona. While it was speculated that this might have been part of a larger bid to prove the viability of Saskatoon as an NHL city, Ice Edge eventually withdrew its bid.\nIn 2019, Regina hosted the NHL Heritage Classic game between the Winnipeg Jets and Calgary Flames at Mosaic Stadium.\nIn January 2022, the Jets considered playing home games in Saskatoon due to COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in Manitoba. The team ultimately decided against the plan.\nThe province was for a short time home to a women's professional team, the Saskatchewan Prairie Ice, which was based out of Lumsden and played from 2003–07 in the Western Women's Hockey League.\nJunior hockey.\nSaskatchewan has a long tradition of junior hockey. The Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League operated as the top level of amateur hockey in the province from 1948–1966. In 1966, half a decade before helping found the WHA, Bill Hunter was the owner, manager, and coach of the Edmonton Oil Kings; he joined forces with three SJHL owners—Scotty Munro of the Estevan Bruins, Del Murphy of the Regina Pats, and Jim Piggott of the Saskatoon Blades—to found the Canadian Major Junior Hockey League in an attempt to create a western Canadian league that could compete with the larger amateur associations in eastern Canada. The Weyburn Red Wings and Moose Jaw Canucks also left the SJHL to join the fledgling league, but the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) labelled it an \"outlaw league\" and suspended its teams from competing for the Memorial Cup. However, the new league held together and when the CAHA reorganized Canadian junior hockey in 1971, it recognized the CMJHL, now called the Western Canada Hockey League, as one of three top tier junior leagues in the country. In 1978 that league was renamed again as the Western Hockey League (WHL), which today features five Saskatchewan teams: the Blades and Pats are joined by the Moose Jaw Warriors, the Prince Albert Raiders, and the Swift Current Broncos. Since the founding of the WHL, the Pats have won two league titles and one Memorial Cup; however, their history dates back to 1917, and the team has won four Memorial Cup championships overall. The Raiders and Broncos have each won one Memorial Cup title. The Memorial Cup tournament has been hosted in Saskatchewan nine times, most recently in Regina in 2018.\nSaskatoon has twice hosted the World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, in 1991 and alongside Regina in 2010. Prominent Saskatchewan players to play in the tournament for Canada include Theoren Fleury, Ryan Getzlaf, Jordan Eberle, and Brayden Schenn. Canada's all-time leading scorer at the tournament, Connor Bedard, played three seasons for the Regina Pats and served as team captain.\nThe Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League was revived after the founding of the WHL as a Junior 'A' league, and today features 12 teams, including the Bruins and Red Wings, who returned after stints in the WHL.\nOther hockey.\nUniversity.\nThe University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina both ice women's and men's hockey teams that compete in the Canada West division of U Sports. The Saskatchewan Huskies have been competing nationally since 1911. The men's team has made seven appearances in the University Cup finals, winning once, in 1983. The University of Saskatchewan has hosted the competition five times, and lost in the final at home to the Alberta Golden Bears in 2014. Saskatchewan is slated to host the women's final for the first time in 2024; the women's team's best national finish was third in 2014 and in 2022. The Cougars men's team made one appearance in the final, losing as the host in 1980. The Cougars women's team hosted the final twice, in 2002 and 2003; the team's best finish came in 2001, when Regina lost the national final.\nSenior.\nSaskatchewan has been home to many successful senior hockey teams. Currently, the major senior league is the Qu'Appelle Valley Highway Hockey League, which currently has seven teams in the Regina area.\nSaskatchewan hockey teams &amp; events.\nUniversity.\nThe Huskies and Cougars ice both men's and women's teams.\nHockey Hall of Fame inductees.\nThe following is a list of players from Saskatchewan inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nIn 2012, Hockey Saskatchewan founded its own Hall of Fame—known as the Ted Knight Saskatchewan Hockey Hall of Fame—to honour contributions to the sport in the province."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.\nThe NCAA recognizes two different All-America selectors for the 1984 college baseball season: the American Baseball Coaches Association (since 1947) and \"Baseball America\" (since 1981)."

        "text": "The 2012–13 BYU Cougars men's basketball team represented Brigham Young University during the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. It was head coach Dave Rose's eighth season at BYU and the Cougars second season in the West Coast Conference. The Cougars played their home games at the Marriott Center. The Cougars finished the regular season at 21–11, good for third place in the WCC. The Cougars accepted an invitation to the NIT, where they lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Baylor. The Cougars finished with an overall record of 24–12, one win away from what would have been a seventh consecutive 25-win season.\nBefore the season.\nRecruiting.\nThrough the course of the fall and spring letter of intent days, the Cougars would bolster their lineup. On November 11, Coach Rose announced that Cory Calvert and Jordan Chatman had signed letters of intent to play for BYU. He revealed then that both Calvert and Chatman planned to serve church missions before joining the team, meaning they wouldn't become part of the BYU team until the 2014–15 season. Freshman Cooper Ainge, son of former BYU great Danny Ainge, announced he would walk-on at BYU. He plans to play for 1 year before departing on a mission. The spring national Letter of Intent Signing Days began on April 10, 2012 and ran through May 16. On the first day of eligibility, Raúl Delgado and Agustín Ambrosino signed letters of intent. Both will come in as juniors and have two years of eligibility. On April 20, it was announced that Cory Calvert would play one season before going on his mission, just as Ainge is doing, because he wouldn't have time to get into playing shape for the 2014–15 season after his mission.\n2012–13 Return Missionaries.\nBYU would also get a boost from 2 return missionaries in the form of Tyler Haws and Kyle Rose. Haws would return to BYU on April 18, 2012 to get ready to play. In Haws first season at BYU (2009–10), Haws would average 11.3 points and 4.2 rebounds a game while helping BYU to a 30–6 record. Rose is the nephew of head coach Dave Rose and will be playing his first regular season for BYU after redshirting the 2009-10 season.\n2012–13 media.\nTelevision information.\nOn the April 30 episode of True Blue, it was announced that fall practice would begin October 12. The Blue-White Scrimmage took place on October 24, and the Cougars had their first scrimmage on October 26. BYUtvsports.com and BYUtv provided coverage of the inter-squad match and the scrimmages. All home games and conference road games aired on BYUtv or on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, or ROOT.\nMedia Day.\nBYU Basketball Media Day was held Wednesday, August 10 from 8:30 AM– 2:30 PM. Jarom Jordan recapped the 2011-12 season and then interviewed every player on the 2012-13 BYU Basketball roster. The day ended with a Dave Rose press conference and then player interviews with various media organizations.\nIt was also announced on Media Day that BYUtv Sports would carry all home broadcasts that ESPN had not picked up while BYUtvsports.com would exclusively carry the 2012 Cougar Classic.\nBYU Radio Sports Network Affiliates.\nKSL 102.7 FM and 1160 AM- Flagship Station (Salt Lake City/ Provo, UT and ksl.com)&lt;br&gt;\nBYU Radio- Nationwide (Dish Network 980, Sirius XM 143, and byuradio.org)&lt;br&gt;\nKTHK- Blackfoot/ Idaho Falls/ Pocatello/ Rexburg, ID&lt;br&gt;\nKMGR- Manti, UT&lt;br&gt;\nKSUB- Cedar City, UT&lt;br&gt;\nKDXU- St. George, UT\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8 style=\"background:#FFFFFF;

        "title": "College Basketball on ABC",
        "text": "ABC first broadcast selected college basketball games of the now-NCAA Division I during the 1960s and 1970s, before it began televising them on a regular basis on January 18, 1987, with a game between the LSU Tigers and Kentucky Wildcats). As CBS and NBC were also broadcasting college games at the time, this put the sport on all three major broadcast television networks.\nAfter the ABC Sports division was merged into ESPN Inc. by parent company Disney in 2006, broadcasts have since been produced by ESPN, and have primarily used the \"ESPN College Basketball\" branding and graphics instead of the College Basketball on ABC branding.\nAfter a five-year hiatus, ABC returned to airing college basketball in 2019 with five games on the network, and has continued to do so since.\nMen's coverage overview.\n1962, 1973, 1978.\nABC first broadcast college basketball games in 1962, when the network aired the NCAA Championship Game on a day-behind delayed basis, as part of its \"Wide World of Sports\" anthology series. On December 15, 1973, ABC aired what is considered to be the first telecast of a regular season college basketball game by a major broadcast network. A feature of the afternoon episode of the program, \"ABC's Wide World of Sports\", the game was a special presentation rather than the start of regular telecasts., and matched UCLA and North Carolina State in St. Louis). Previously, postseason games in the NCAA tournament had been shown on NBC. Regular season college basketball games, though not on ABC, NBC or CBS, had been syndicated to U.S. television stations, such as the so-called \"Game of the Century\" sold to stations nationwide by the TVS Television Network in 1968. ABC (which had recently lost the NBA rights to CBS) televised this game using its former NBA announcing crew of Keith Jackson and Bill Russell.\nIn the 1977–78 season, C.D. Chesley (who controlled the rights to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) at the time) wanted NBC to televise select ACC games as part of its national package as it had done the previous few years. However, NBC wanted to feature intersectional games. This action greatly upset Chesley, who wound up selling the rights to the ACC Tournament final to ABC. ABC would televise the 1978 ACC Tournament final as part of \"Wide World of Sports\". The game, called by Keith Jackson and Bill Russell, marked the first time Duke University's Blue Devils basketball team played on national television.\n1987–2014.\nWhen ABC's coverage began in 1987, the network primarily covered the Big Ten, Big 8 and Pac-10 Conferences. By 1991 (around the time NBC was phasing out their own college basketball coverage), ABC ramped up its basketball coverage in an effort to fill the void. As a result, the network also started to cover games focusing on teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and Southeastern Conference (SEC). Otherwise, it was essentially, a considerable hodge-podge with an ACC game one week, or a Pac-10 or Big 10 game the next. The games that were broadcast were a hodge-podge of conference matchups even after the ESPN on ABC brand change, with SEC and Big East match-ups occasionally being shown alongside frequent ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 match-ups.\nABC's early regular season broadcasts were, for the most part, technically time buys from organizations such as Raycom (particularly, around 1990–91) or sister network ESPN. This in return, was a way to avoid union contracts which require that 100% of network shows had to use crew staff who were network union members. During the early 1990s, Raycom paid ABC US$1.8 million for six weeks of network airtime of 26 regional games. The format allowed Raycom to control the games and sell the advertising.\nIn the 1987–88 season, ABC did not air any college basketball games during the last three weekends of February due to the network's coverage of the Winter Olympics. As previously mentioned, coverage by ABC steadily increased during the early 1990s; by the 1991–92 season, ABC was carrying regional games in many timeslots on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. By 1997, ABC's presenting sponsor was Paine Webber.\nStarting in 1997, coverage of the PGA Tour limited the number of games that the network showed; this continued through 2006. Coverage of the NBA further decreased college basketball coverage on the network when ABC Sports acquired the broadcast rights to the league (through a production arrangement with ESPN) beginning in 2002. Beginning with the 2007 season, all games were rebranded as part of the integration of ABC Sports into ESPN as ESPN on ABC (meaning that all sports telecasts on ABC would exclusively feature ESPN's graphics, music and announcers) and Sunday games were discontinued. From 2007 to 2009, all games began at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time, which was a departure from the differing broadcast times that were previously assigned to the game telecasts.\nFrom 2010 to 2013, ABC broadcast the semi-finals and finals of the SEC men's basketball tournament. In 2014, ABC only broadcast the semi-final round of the tournament.\n2019–2024.\nFor the first time since 2009, ABC returned to airing regular season college basketball games in 2019. The network would air 5 games, starting on December 8, when the Texas Longhorns hosted the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, and has slowly increased since then.\nIn 2022, the numbers of college basketball games on ABC was reduced due to ABC's coverage of the XFL.\nIn 2023–2024, ABC will only air one men's college basketball game between Kansas and Baylor, though women's college basketball games will continue to air on the network.\nWomen's coverage overview.\nBeginning with the 2021 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, select women's college basketball games have also aired on ABC. In December 2021, the first regular season women's college basketball game aired on ABC. Beginning with the 2022 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, ABC also airs the final of the tournament, along with select weekend tournament games.\nCommentators.\nCurrently, Dan Shulman and Jay Bilas are the primary announcing team for men's college basketball, while Beth Mowins and Rebecca Lobo are the primary announcing team for women's college basketball, with Ryan Ruocco joining Lobo during the NCAA Tournament.\nIn the early years of ABC's regular college basketball coverage, Keith Jackson and Dick Vitale were the primary announcing crew, while Gary Bender was the secondary play-by-play announcer behind Jackson. Meanwhile, Al Michaels did regional games during this period.\nWhen Brent Musburger came over from CBS in late 1990, he started working with Dick Vitale on the main team. Jim Valvano did color commentary on games for ABC for a few years until his death in 1993; Vitale and Valvano were paired as co-analysts on ABC's college basketball broadcasts a few times during the 1991–92 season. In the 1992–93 season, Terry Gannon filled in on a few games for Valvano, who at the time was battling cancer, which would ultimately claim his life in April 1993.\nSteve Lavin replaced Dick Vitale as the lead analyst beginning in 2005, as Vitale moved to ESPN's weekly primetime showcase game. From 2010 until 2014, when ABC only aired the SEC men's basketball tournament, Brad Nessler and Jimmy Dykes served as the broadcast team. When college basketball returned to ABC during the 2019-2020 season, a variety of \"ESPN College Basketball\" analysts were used, including Dick Vitale."

        "title": "Monmouth Cricket Club",
        "text": "Monmouth Cricket Club is based at Monmouth Sports Ground, Chippenham Fields, in Monmouth, Wales.\nThe club runs junior sides, an U15s, U13s and U11s, which play in the Gwent League.\nIn 2012, Monmouth rejoined the Cricket Wales pyramid after 20 years having been accepted into the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire League (now the South East Wales Cricket League) in Division Three.\nHistory.\nMonmouth has had a cricket club since at least 1838. Monmouth was fielding a cricket team from 1835 its members were drawn from the local Monmouth wealthy and their employees. In 1839, When Monmouth played the Forest Of Dean, both sides agreed to draw players from subscribing members only, ending the practice of bringing in crack players for individual matches.\nMatches were played on alternate Thursdays. In the early days, it was customary for the home team to entertain and the visitors and also provide a meal between innings. This had a detrimental effect on the players' abilities. After the 1850s the food was served following the game.\nThe bowling was performed with under arm throwing during the early years. In 1856 Monmouth secured the bowling services of James Lillywhite as a coach and bowler who introduced overarm bowling and according to Keith Kissack was probably related to the Sussex round arm bowler W Lillywhite who pioneered such bowling in the 1830s.\nIn 1866 Gloucestershire went on tour in to play Ross, Hereford and Monmouth. The tour was intended to encourage Cricket in the Area. The Match was played on the Beaufort Field. The Gloucestershire team included three of the Graces:- G.F. Grace aged 16, W.G. Grace aged 18 and E. M. Grace aged 25. W.G. Grace had recently scored 224 not out against Surrey and the bat he used against Monmouth had a Silver Shield on it recording the achievement. W.G. Grace was bowled first ball by J.S.Hood. According to the \"Monmouth Beacon\", the ball was bowled \"Knee-high ne plus ultra\" which implied the ball was bowled under arm.\nIn 1870 Agincourt Cricket Club was the main Monmouth cricket club in Monmouth which was formed by a breakaway group of the Monmouth Cricket Club. Charles Henry Crompton-Roberts established Monmouth's first cricket ground in Drybridge Park in 1874. In 1874 they beat the Combined Universities XI. In 1875, he staged the first of his Annual Cricket Weeks. The event became very popular and in 1883, thanks to the recent arrival of the railways, Drybridge Park hosted a game between the Combined Universities and the world.\nThe death of Crompton Roberts in 1891 meant that the ground at Drybridge Park became unavailable. Colonel Walwyn made an unsuccessful attempt to open a ground on Chippenham Park. The Monmouth team then returned to Beaufort Meadow. Interest in Cricket began to wane until 1910 when a local ladies team beat the town team by 55 runs. The Monmouth (Agincourt) Cricket Club was disbanded in March 1914 but friendly Monmouth games continued.\nMore recent history.\nMonmouth Cricket Club celebrated back-to-back Marches League Division One titles and Marches Cup crowns in 2003, 2004, and 2005.\nAfter an unprecedented treble double, the club moved to the Worcestershire County League in 2006, achieving promotion from Division Three (South) in its first year.\nThe club consolidated its place in Division Two for five seasons, narrowly missing out on promotion to Division One in 2010.\nMonmouth's members voted to rejoin the Cricket Wales pyramid – after a 20-year exile – for the benefit of its growing junior section.\nHaving been accepted into the Glamorgan and Monmouthshire League (now the South East Wales Cricket League) for the 2012 campaign, Monmouth finished top of Division Three but the season was declared null and void owing to a rain-ravaged summer.\nWith support from parents, Cricket Wales and local MP David Davies, then chairman Martin Newell and vice-chairman Ian Morgan secured substantial grant funding for a two-bay outdoor net facility which was built at Monmouth Sports Ground in July 2015.\nAfter a succession of near misses, the club finally gained promotion from the South East Wales Cricket League Division Three in 2017.\nThe return of experienced players David Teague and Jonathan Roberts from Chepstow, coupled with mature performances from Wales Under-15s duo Harry Friend and Joe Harris and Glamorgan Academy leg-spinner Sam Swingwood, helped Monmouth to a golden summer in 2018. The club clinched promotion from Division Two by winning the title at its first attempt and then managed to achieve a respectable 8th place finish out of 12 teams in its first season in the top flight.\nIn 2012, the Kings Head Hotel (J D Westherspoons) sponsored the Monmouth Cricket Club. There is a framed shirt on the wall and the club holds its monthly meetings at the pub.\nThe children train on Wednesdays throughout the summer at Monmouth Sports Ground."

        "text": "Fenerbahçe Basketball, commonly referred as Fenerbahçe () or Fenerbahce Istanbul in European matches, currently also known as Fenerbahçe Beko for sponsorship reasons, are a professional basketball team and the men's basketball department of Fenerbahçe S.K., a major Turkish multi-sport club based in Istanbul, Turkey. They are one of the most successful clubs in Turkish basketball history, being the first Turkish team to have won the EuroLeague, as well as 13 Turkish championships (10 titles in the Turkish Super League and three in the former Turkish Basketball Championship), eight Turkish Cups, and seven Turkish Super Cups, among others. They play their home matches at the club's own Ülker Sports and Event Hall.\nBesides the European championship title in 2017, which was secured by a convincing 80–64 win against Greek powerhouse Olympiacos in the final, Fenerbahçe have also been EuroLeague runners-up in 2016 and 2018. Fener also have played in five consecutive EuroLeague Final Fours (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) to date, a record in Turkish basketball. Currently, Fenerbahçe are considered to be one of the top teams of the Turkish Super League, which is among the best European national domestic basketball leagues.\nMany memorable players in European basketball have played for Fenerbahçe over the years, some of which have included: Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Žan Tabak, Conrad McRae, Nemanja Bjelica, Ömer Aşık, Thabo Sefolosha, Linas Kleiza, Ömer Onan, Mirsad Türkcan, David Andersen, Harun Erdenay, Damir Mršić, Bojan Bogdanović, Semih Erden, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Tanoka Beard, Nikos Zisis, James Gist, Gordan Giriček, Mike Batiste, Marko Milič, Will Solomon, Bo McCalebb, Ekpe Udoh, Pero Antić, Luigi Datome, Nikola Kalinić, Kostas Sloukas, Jan Veselý, Ali Muhammed, Nicolò Melli, Bogdan Bogdanović, and Nando De Colo.\nŽeljko Obradović, the most successful coach in the history of European basketball, was the head coach of Fenerbahçe between 2013 and 2020. Obradović was replaced by former Phoenix Suns head coach Igor Kokoškov on July 2, 2020, following his decision to take a break from competitive basketball.\nHistory.\nEarly history and first titles.\nThe men's basketball department of Fenerbahçe was initially founded in 1913, but could not persist due to the Balkan Wars and World War I. Eventually, under the initiative of Muhtar Sencer and Cem Atabeyoğlu, it was founded in its current permanent form in 1944 and achieved considerable success when the sport established itself in Turkey.\nFenerbahçe, who dominated the sport with notable players of the period such as Sacit Seldüz, Hikmet Vardar, Erdoğan Karabelen, Yılmaz Gündüz and Mehmet Baturalp under the leadership of memorable coach Samim Göreç, became champions of the Istanbul Basketball League in 1954–55, 1955–56, and 1956–57. By defeating their rivals Galatasaray 55–47 on February 5, 1955, which was the first basketball game broadcast live on radio in Turkey, Fener celebrated their first championship.\nThe club made a new breakthrough in amateur sports, after İsmet Uluğ, one of the former football players and boxers of the club became president in 1962, and won Istanbul League titles again in 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65 and 1965–66.\nFenerbahçe won Turkish Basketball Championship titles in 1957, 1959, and 1965 undefeated, just before the current professional Turkish Super League was founded in 1966, and made it to the European Champions Cup in 1960 and 1966.\nStruggle against corporation teams and beginning of the rise (1970s–2014).\nThey remained a solid team in the rest of the 1960s, but had mixed success in the following decades, especially the 70s and 80s. Those decades were dominated by the likes of Efes Pilsen and Eczacıbaşı, and later also Ülkerspor, who won most of the titles. As these teams belonged to notable corporations with a solid financial background and support, traditional sports clubs such as Fenerbahçe had difficulties keeping up with them.\nFenerbahçe finished the league leader three times with stars such as Erman Kunter, Aytek Gürkan, Can Sonat, Ferhat Oktay, Pete Williams and Larry Richard in the seasons 1984–85, 1987–88 and 1989–90, but was eliminated in the playoffs. Erman Kunter broke the record by scoring 153 points in a game of the 1987–1988 season, in which the yellow-navy blues team beat Hilalspor 175–101.\nFenerbahçe would reach championship in 1991 that the fans were waiting for. Levent Topsakal, Larry Richard, Hüsnü Çakırgil and head coach Çetin Yılmaz led Fenerbahçe to the Turkish League title over Tofaş.\nFenerbahçe returned to the EuroLeague in 1992, but lost in the preliminary round. The club were back in the Turkish League finals in 1992, 1993, and 1995, but could not find a way to win the championship for some time. Fenerbahçe continued to have success in the late 90s. A third-place finish in the 1997–98 season allowed the club to return to the EuroLeague in 1998–99 season, and with players like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Marko Milič, Žan Tabak, İbrahim Kutluay, and the late Conrad McRae, Fenerbahçe advanced to the eighth-final playoffs, losing there to Real Madrid. İbrahim Kutluay won the EuroLeague top scorer trophy with an average of 21.4 points.\nThe club made it to the Saporta Cup quarter-finals in 1994–95. The following season Fenerbahçe reached the quarter-finals of the Korać Cup in 1995–96 and repeated this achievement in 2000–01. The early 2000s, however, were with very limited success. After Aydın Örs started as a coach in 2004, Fenerbahçe returned to the Turkish League semifinals and had a great return to European competitions, finishing in fourth place in the 2004–05 FIBA Europe League.\nIn the summer of 2006, the basketball club acquired a main sponsorship deal with Ülker, to form Fenerbahçe Ülker. After the sponsorship agreement, Fenerbahçe dominated the Turkish League and became the league champions two times in a row after 16 years and the team returned to the EuroLeague. After losing the Turkish League championship to Efes Pilsen in the 2008–09 season, in a closely contested playoff finals, Fenerbahçe became Turkish League champions again in the 2009–10 season, this time by defeating Efes Pilsen in the finals 4–2.\nFenerbahçe Ülker headed into the 2010–11 season with five new transfers: Engin Atsür, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Marko Tomas, Kaya Peker, and Darjuš Lavrinovič. With new head coach Neven Spahija, Fenerbahçe Ülker continued their domination in the Turkish League, winning both the Turkish Cup and the Turkish League, over long time rivals Beşiktaş and Galatasaray, respectively.\nAfter two disappointing seasons, in 2011–12 and 2012–13 where Fenerbahçe Ülker finished in fifth place in the Turkish league, legendary coach Željko Obradović was then signed as the team's head coach, and the roster was strengthened with the likes of former Toronto Raptor Linas Kleiza, promising power forward Nemanja Bjelica, consistent center Luka Žorić, and hot Turkish prospects Kenan Sipahi and Melih Mahmutoğlu. Fenerbahçe became the Turkish League champions once again, after beating eternal rivals Galatasaray in the playoff's finals of the 2013–14 season. Success in the EuroLeague, however, continued to elude the team.\nAt the top of Europe: Golden age with Obradović (2014–2020).\nIn the 2014–15 season, Fenerbahçe reached the EuroLeague Final Four for the first time in their history. In the quarterfinals, Fenerbahçe knocked out Maccabi Tel Aviv with three straight wins. In the semifinals, the team lost to Real Madrid, and eventually finished fourth. At the end of the season, the club's sponsorship agreement with Ülker ended. In the 2015–16 season, Fenerbahçe impressed in the EuroLeague Regular Season and Top 16, and qualified once again for the Final Four tournament, by eliminating the defending champions, Real Madrid, in the playoffs, again with a score of 3–0. During their first Final Four match against Laboral Kutxa, Fenerbahçe faced risking elimination once again before Kostas Sloukas made a game-tying lay-up to force the game into overtime, where Bogdan Bogdanović would help lead the team in overtime to win 88–77. The club became the first Turkish team to ever make it to the EuroLeague Final game. Their final opponent in the EuroLeague competition was CSKA Moscow. Fenerbahçe lost 101–96 after overtime.\nIn the following 2016–17 season, Fenerbahçe won their first European championship. The club beat Greek powerhouse Olympiacos 80–64 in the championship game of the Final Four, that was held in Istanbul. Fenerbahçe became the first and only Turkish team in history to win the EuroLeague title. Center Ekpe Udoh was named EuroLeague Final Four MVP. Following their European title, Fenerbahçe acquired a new main sponsor deal in the 2017 off-season. Doğuş Group signed a three-year contract with the club, worth an amount of €45 million, which guaranteed the club the largest name sponsorship deal in European basketball history.\nIn the 2017–18 season, Fenerbahçe finished second at the regular season of the EuroLeague. In the Playoffs, they faced off against Kirolbet Baskonia, whom they eliminated with 3–1 in the best-of-five series. Thus the club managed to reach the EuroLeague Final Four for the fourth time in a row, improving their record. The team eventually lost against Real Madrid in the championship final. Fenerbahçe also continued their domination of the Turkish Super League - after a setback in 2015, Fenerbahçe won the 2016, 2017, and 2018 championships in dominating fashion.\nBefore the beginning of the 2018–19 season, Doğuş withdrew from the sponsorship deal which originally was projected for three years. Following the unexpected retraction, a new main sponsorship agreement with Beko was initiated. During the 2018–19 season, Fenerbahçe became the only team who stayed undefeated at home after a 30-game regular season and secured the best record after a regular season (25–5) under the new EuroLeague format (2016–17 season to present). Fener also became the earliest EuroLeague Playoffs qualifiers ever in the modern EuroLeague era. Domestically, the Yellow-Navy Blues defeated rivals Anadolu Efes in the 2019 Turkish Cup final to claim their sixth title. Fenerbahçe defeated BC Žalgiris, 3–1, in the EuroLeague quarterfinals, qualifying to their fifth consecutive Final Four. In the EuroLeague Final Four, however, Fenerbahçe was beaten by Anadolu Efes in the semifinals, and Real Madrid in the third place game, finishing in a disappointing fourth place. In the Turkish Super League, Fenerbahçe once again made the finals - however, in an upset, they were again defeated by Anadolu Efes in a seven game series.\nThe 2019-2020 season was the last under Obradović. Fenerbahçe managed to win the 2020 Turkish Cup by beating Teksüt Bandırma in the quarterfinals, Türk Telekom in the semifinals, and Darüşşafaka in the finals. Despite improving their roster with signings like Derrick Williams and Nando De Colo, Fenerbahçe struggled in the EuroLeague - at the time the season was stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic, Fenerbahçe was fighting for the final playoff spot, and in the Turkish Super League, Fenerbahçe was just 4th - behind Anadolu Efes, Pınar Karşıyaka and Galatasaray. Both tournaments were cancelled with no champions announced. In the summer, coach Obradović resigned.\nPost-Obradović (2020–present).\nFenerbahçe signed former Phoenix Suns head coach Igor Kokoškov to replace Obradović. Fenerbahçe underwent many changes during the post season, though managed to keep top players like Vesely and De Colo on the roster. The team greatly struggled in the EuroLeague, suffering many embarrassing blowout loses in the beginning, and fell quickly behind Anadolu Efes in the Turkish Super League standings, but with the late season signing of Marko Gudurić, the team greatly improved. A winning streak in the EuroLeague helped Fenerbahçe make the EuroLeague playoffs with a 20-14 record and 7th place in the regular season. In the playoffs, Fenerbahçe was swept by CSKA Moscow. In the Turkish Super League, Fenerbahçe returned to the finals and faced the 2021 EuroLeague champions Anadolu Efes, who easily swept Fenerbahçe in the finals. Despite signing a long term contract, Kokoškov left Fenerbahçe during the summer.\nDuring the off-season, Fenerbahçe signed Saša Đorđević as the new head coach. Fenerbahçe had higher expectations for the season than the previous year. In the EuroLeague, Fenerbahçe struggled, and for the first time since the 2013-2014 season, failed to make the playoffs - finishing in a disappointing 12th place, and coach Đorđević suffered much criticism. To add more insult, Anadolu Efes repeated as the 2022 EuroLeague champions. In the re-established Turkish Cup, Fenerbahçe was beaten by Anadolu Efes. However, in the Turkish Super League, Fenerbahçe got their revenge - they finished over Efes in the regular season standings, earning home-court advantage for the playoffs, and made the finals - in the finals, Fenerbahçe beat Anadolu Efes 3-1 to win the championship, their record breaking 10th Turkish League championship.\nSponsorship naming.\nDue to sponsorship deals, Fenerbahçe have been also known as:\nEuropean history.\nFenerbahçe participated in European competitions numerous times throughout their history and became the most successful Turkish club ever. By winning the former Turkish Basketball Championship, the club represented Turkey for their first time in the FIBA European Champions Cup in 1959–60 and again in 1965–66. Some years later, they made it to the FIBA European Cup quarter-finals in the 1994–95 season. The following season Fenerbahçe reached the quarter-finals of the FIBA Korać Cup in 1996 and repeated this achievement in 2001. In the 1998–99 season of the FIBA EuroLeague, they reached the Top 16 stage, but lost there to Real Madrid. The club became fourth in the 2004–05 season of the FIBA EuroChallenge. The first major success in the modern era EuroLeague was achieved in the 2007–08 season, where Fenerbahçe reached the quarter-finals. The first Final Four participation in the history of the club followed some years later, in the 2014–15 season, when the team eliminated reigning European champions Maccabi Tel Aviv in the play-offs with three straight victories under the guidance of legendary coach Željko Obradović. In the semi-final game they lost against Real Madrid and eventually finished fourth. In the next season, the club reached the final of the competition with a convincing overall performance, again by eliminating the reigning champions (Real Madrid) with three straight wins, and lost dramatically against CSKA Moscow in overtime. Then eventually, in 2017, Fenerbahçe managed to win the EuroLeague trophy as the first and only Turkish club ever, in their own city, by defeating Greek giants Olympiacos in the final game with a score of 80–64. From the quarter-finals onwards, the club eliminated their opponents in dominating fashion, first sweeping Greek giants Panathinaikos Superfoods with 3–0 wins despite the home-court disadvantage, and then defeating European powerhouses Real Madrid and Olympiacos with being behind only for a few seconds in total in the Final Four in Istanbul.\nAgainst NBA teams.\nOn 5 October 2012, Fenerbahçe became the first and only Turkish basketball club to win against an NBA team, having beaten the Boston Celtics by a score of 97–91 at the Ülker Sports Arena. By defeating the Brooklyn Nets 101–96 in Barclays Center on 5 October 2015, Fenerbahçe became the first and only Turkish basketball club and only third club in basketball history to win against an NBA team in the United States.\nIndividual awards and achievements.\nRetired Numbers\n50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Chosen:\"\n\"Nominated:\"\nEuroLeague Legends\nEuroLeague Basketball 2000–10 All-Decade Team\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Chosen:\"\n\"Nominated:\"\nEuroLeague Basketball 2010–20 All-Decade Team\n&lt;br&gt;\n\"Chosen:\"\n\"Nominated:\"\nEuroLeague MVP\nEuroLeague Final Four MVP\nAll-EuroLeague First Team\nAll-EuroLeague Second Team\nEuroLeague MVP of the Month\nEuroLeague Rising Star\nEuroLeague Coach of the Year\nEuroLeague Executive of the Year\nEuroLeague Magic Moment of the Season\nEuroLeague records since 2000–01\nEuroLeague Top Scorer\nEuroLeague Rebounding Leaders\nEuroLeague Blocked Shoots Leaders\nTurkish Super League Finals MVP\nTurkish League Top Scorer\nTurkish Cup Final MVP\nTurkish Super Cup MVP\nSponsorship and kit manufacturers.\n&lt;br&gt;(*) One Embraer 195 jet (TC-YAT) is painted with Fenerbahçe S.K.'s livery"

        "title": "2009 Women's Cricket World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup final was a Women's One Day International match between the England women's cricket team and the New Zealand women's national cricket team, played on 22 March 2009 at the North Sydney Oval in Australia. It was the culmination of the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup, the ninth edition of the tournament. England won the final by four wickets, clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup; England won their previous final contest in 1993.\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand captain, Haidee Tiffen, won the toss, and opted to bat first. Her side were bowled out for 166 runs. The all-rounder Lucy Doolan, batting at number nine, was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. Nicky Shaw, one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening partnership of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 balls to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been in the England starting lineup, was named player of the match, having replaced the injured Jenny Gunn minutes before the game started.\nBackground.\nThe 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup was the ninth edition of the tournament, and the first to be organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The first had been held in 1973, pre-dating the first men's Cricket World Cup by two years. The 2009 tournament included eight teams, six of which (Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and the West Indies) qualified automatically due to finishing as the top six teams at the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup, while the other two (Pakistan and South Africa) qualified through the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Matches, which consisted of 50 overs-per-side, took place at several cricket grounds in Australia between 7 and 22 March, featuring 25 matches over 16 days.\nAlthough the ICC had successfully developed and expanded the women's game, from 15 member countries in 2005 to 42 in 2007, there was a growing gap between the top four teams—Australia, England, India and New Zealand—and the rest. In 2008, England and then Australia became the first teams to introduce contracts for some of their women's players; Charlotte Edwards, England's captain, said that this allowed the players to \"commit to training without worrying about our jobs outside cricket.\" Before the competition, Jenny Roesler of \"Cricinfo\" suggested England and New Zealand, along with Australia, as the favourites to win the competition. Haidee Tiffen, the captain of New Zealand, said that she thought \"Australia, New Zealand, England and India are of equal strength and any team can beat the other on its day. It is an open tournament with no clear-cut favourites.\" England's Claire Taylor said that she thought that Australia might struggle after losing key members of their 2005 World Cup-winning squad.\nRoute to the final.\nGroup stage.\nNew Zealand were drawn in Group A of the competition, along with Australia, South Africa and the West Indies. They started their campaign against Australia. Tiffen scored a cautious half-century for New Zealand, but her dismissal triggered a collapse in which the team lost seven wickets for the addition of 34 runs. In their reply, Australia regularly lost wickets, and a six over bowling spell by medium pacer Kate Pulford, in which she took three wickets for 30 runs, slowed the run chase. After an initial rain delay held up the game, a second downpour finished the match, with Australia 13 runs short by the Duckworth–Lewis method. Tiffen missed New Zealand's second match, against the West Indies, with an injury, and Aimee Mason deputised as captain. For the second time in as many matches, New Zealand suffered a collapse, losing their first six wickets for 104 runs. A seventh-wicket partnership of 57 between Mason and Sarah Tsukigawa helped New Zealand to remain competitive in the match, and they completed their 50 overs with 192 runs. According to \"Cricinfo\", the West Indian reply \"was devoid of momentum\". Spin bowlers Mason and Lucy Doolan took three wickets apiece to limit the West Indies to 136 runs for the loss of eight wickets from their overs. In their final group stage match, a win over South Africa ensured that New Zealand won the group. Amy Satterthwaite, Sara McGlashan and Nicola Browne all scored half-centuries as their team reached a total of 250 for five. South Africa struggled in their chase: only Cri-Zelda Brits reached double figures in an innings dominated by the bowling of Mason and Suzie Bates, who collected four wickets each, helping New Zealand earn a 199-run victory.\nEngland were placed in Group B, alongside India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In their first contest, against Sri Lanka, they scored 277 runs, aided by a 95-ball century from Claire Taylor, and a half-century by Caroline Atkins. Sri Lanka batted their full allocation of overs, but lost by 100 runs. Laura Marsh took three wickets, and three of the Sri Lankan batters were run out in their chase. Following the match, Jenny Gunn's bowling action was reported to the ICC as being potentially illegal, but she was cleared a few days later. England faced India in their second match, in a contest billed as the battle for top spot in the group. England won the match easily, bowling India out for 169: Gunn and Holly Colvin each took three wickets, while both Atkins and Claire Taylor scored unbeaten half-centuries. Another large win, over Pakistan, guaranteed that England finished as group winners. Marsh took a career-best five wickets to help bowl Pakistan out for just 78 runs, a total which her side reached in less than half of their allowed overs.\nSuper Sixes.\nAfter the initial league stage, the bottom team from each group was eliminated, and the remaining teams progressed into the Super Sixes. During this stage, results and points from matches between the teams that had qualified were carried over, and each team played a further three matches, against those teams that had advanced from the other group. England and New Zealand met each other in the first match of the Super Sixes. England batted first, and despite being 96 for four at one stage, 57 runs from Edwards, and a rapid 22 runs from Gunn, helped their side recover to post a total of 201 for five. In response, New Zealand began positively, and were boosted by a half-century from their captain, Tiffen, but the spin bowling of Edwards, Marsh and Colvin controlled the run rate, and New Zealand were eventually bowled out for 170, Edwards taking four wickets. England's following match was against the West Indies, and they once again surpassed 200 runs after batting first. Sarah Taylor, Claire Taylor and Atkins all scored half-centuries to propel England to their total of 236 for eight. The English bowlers then dismissed the West Indies for 90 runs, Marsh collecting three wickets. The win secured England a place in the final, irrespective of the result of their final Super Sixes match against Australia.\nAfter losing their first Super Sixes match to England, New Zealand faced an Indian side which had beaten Australia in their first Super Six contest. India batted first and scored 207, during an innings in which they lost four batters to run outs. New Zealand began their response well, putting on a partnership of 78 runs for the first wicket between Pulford and Tiffen. After Tiffen's dismissal, Bates supported Pulford, who eventually fell for 71 runs, and New Zealand reached their target with 14 balls to spare. New Zealand set a record partnership for the second wicket in women's ODIs in their final match: Bates scored 168 and Tiffen 100 as the pair put on 262 runs together. Bates played an aggressive innings, scoring her runs from 105 balls, including 6 sixes and 19 fours. New Zealand reached 373 from their overs, and bowled Pakistan out for 150, earning themselves a 223-run victory, and qualifying for the final. England were outplayed by Australia in their final Super Six match: Shelley Nitschke slowed the run rate during her bowling, taking two wickets and restricting England to just 14 runs from her 10 overs. England were bowled out for 161, a total Australia chased down within 34 overs. England's loss to Australia ended a 17-match unbeaten run.\nBuild-up.\nThe final was a repeat of the 1993 tournament, when England won at Lord's. Both sides had won the World Cup previously, but only when hosting the tournament. New Zealand achieved the feat in 2000, while England were winners in both 1973 and 1993. As well as losing the 1993 final to England, New Zealand were also finalists in 1997, losing to Australia in India. England had contested five previous finals; losing to Australia in subsequent tournaments in 1978, 1982 and 1988. Huw Richards, writing for the \"International Herald Tribune\", described both England and New Zealand as worthy finalists, and noted that he was disappointed with the performance of Australia, who finished fourth. Simon Wilde of \"The Times\" cited England as favourites: \"In Edwards they have the ICC player of the year, in Claire Taylor the No 1-ranked batsman and in Isa Guha the No 1 bowler.\" \"The New Zealand Herald\"s Mark Geenty concurred that England were favourites, describing them as \"the form side of recent years\". England had beaten New Zealand in their most recent four matches, including their victory over them during the Super Sixes stage of the competition. New Zealand's coach, Gary Stead, said that his team would aim to play their normal \"aggressive style of play and although that may be a bit more high risk, I think it's the style that we play best.\"\nAfter the Australian team was knocked out, local press coverage for the match diminished; only three journalists attended the pre-game press conference for the final. A reporter for the BBC, Alison Mitchell, said that in the Australian newspapers, \"the nationals and even most of the locals I flicked through on Saturday carried nothing except one slim column\". The 2009 World Cup was the first to be televised globally; ESPN Star Sports provided coverage from seven matches, including the final. As well as being available on television, the matches were streamed on the ESPN Star Sports website. The match was also broadcast on the radio; Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the BBC provided joint coverage.\nEngland all-rounder Gunn aggravated a calf strain during the warm-up, and 10 minutes before the start was replaced by the team's vice-captain, Nicky Shaw.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe final was played on a fine day at the North Sydney Oval, a multi-purpose stadium in North Sydney, New South Wales. The ground had hosted matches earlier in the tournament, and during the 1988 Women's Cricket World Cup, but, as of 2020, has not hosted men's international cricket. Played in front of a crowd of 2,300, the match began at 10:00 AEDT (23:00 GMT), with a scheduled lunch interval from 13:10 to 13:55. Steve Davis, of Australia, and the South African Brian Jerling were appointed as the on-field umpires for the match. Davis was a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, the highest designation for an umpire, while Jerling was on the International Panel of Umpires and Referees, the next most senior designation. Tyron Wijewardene and Jeff Brookes fulfilled the off-field roles of third and fourth umpires respectively, and Brian Aldridge served as match referee. Aldridge had previously umpired the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final.\nDespite conditions conducive to swing bowling, New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, chose to bat first after winning the toss. England opened the bowling with Katherine Brunt and Isa Guha. Brunt's bowling spell was described by the BBC's Aimee Lewis as \"superb\", and teammate Shaw credited her with putting the New Zealand batters under pressure. The New Zealand opening batters, Pulford and Tiffen, put on 26 runs together before Pulford was caught by Claire Taylor off the bowling of Guha, having scored 8 runs. According to Roesler, players on both teams showed some early nerves: Tiffen played some uncertain shots, while Guha bowled some wide deliveries. New Zealand progressed to 46 for one before England made their first bowling change. The England vice-captain, Shaw, was brought on, and made an immediate impact. In her first over, Bates attempted a loft over mid-on, and was caught by Atkins. The following ball, Satterthwaite fell for a duck, edging a delivery to the wicket-keeper, Sarah Taylor, leaving New Zealand 49 for three. Four overs later, Tiffen was also dismissed by Shaw, caught behind by Sarah Taylor. McGlashan was described by Lewis as looking \"in fine touch\", but after scoring 21 runs from 20 deliveries, she was caught at mid-wicket by Greenway off the bowling of Colvin. After 20 overs, New Zealand were 74 for five, their most prolific batters of the tournament having been dismissed. Marsh subsequently bowled Mason for 13, while Tsukigawa edged a delivery from Brunt for 2: New Zealand's innings collapsed to 101 for seven. Doolan joined Browne at the crease, and the pair helped to recover the innings somewhat: Doolan scored 48 runs in a partnership of 63 to help New Zealand to their total of 166. After the dismissal of Doolan, who was stumped off a wide delivery, New Zealand subsided rapidly, losing their final two wickets for just two more runs. \"The New Zealand Herald\" criticised the batting as being \"indifferent\", while Richards credited England for their \"tight bowling and fielding\" to restrict New Zealand.\nSimon Briggs of \"The Daily Telegraph\" described the start of England's chase as being \"smooth and confident\": opening batters Atkins and Sarah Taylor built a partnership larger than any managed by New Zealand, scoring 74 runs. Taylor was the first batter out, caught by Tiffen at mid-wicket from the off-spin bowling of Doolan for 39 runs. Claire Taylor came to the crease upon Sarah Taylor's dismissal and played with a similar attacking intent, striking four boundaries during her 21 runs before she was bowled by Mason, with England 109 for two. Atkins played a patient innings, and scored the most runs for her side, accruing 40 from 85 balls, eventually being caught by Sophie Devine from the bowling of Dooley. England's middle order suffered their own collapse against the spin bowling of Doolan and Mason; their scoring rate slowing significantly from 4.78 runs per over at the end of the fourteenth over to 3.58 twenty overs later. Edwards became Dooley's third wicket when she was given out after being caught by wicket-keeper Rachel Priest for 10 runs, though \"Cricinfo\" suggested that she had not actually hit the ball. Despite their struggles through the middle overs, Richards opined that \"England never looked like losing.\" Greenway and Morgan were both dismissed for single-figure totals: Greenway had survived an early appeal when she was caught after the ball had hit her pads, but was later caught by Satterthwaite off the bowling of Mason for eight runs, to leave England on 139 for five; Morgan was the victim of a what Lewis described as a \"sloppy run out\" shortly thereafter, moving the score to 149 for six. It was Shaw who once again galvanised England, batting with a more attacking style than those that had struggled before her. Her score of 17 not out pushed England towards the winning target, and a single from Colvin secured victory for England with 23 balls remaining in the innings. Shaw's contribution earned her the player of the match accolade.\nScorecard.\nMatch officials\nKey\nAftermath.\nEngland received US$45,000 from the ICC for winning the tournament, while New Zealand received $25,000. Shaw, who had not expected to play, said after the match; \"I started the day crying, I finished it crying, but we won a World Cup in between\". New Zealand's captain, Tiffen, reflected after the match, \"Maybe there were some nerves in amongst the camp. We didn't hype it up to be anything more than another day at the office, unfortunately it was a bad day at the office.\" The team of the tournament included seven finalists: England's Edwards was selected as captain, and was joined by teammates Brunt, Marsh, Claire Taylor and Sarah Taylor. Bates and Pulford represented New Zealand in the team, while Devine was named as the team's twelfth woman. Claire Taylor, who finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, was named as the player of the tournament. The month after the final, Taylor became the first woman to be selected as one of \"Wisden's\" Cricketers of the Year. Both Taylor and Edwards were awarded MBEs for their services to cricket; Edwards received hers in the 2009 Birthday Honours, while Taylor's came in the 2010 New Year Honours.\nThe England team flew back to the United Kingdom in economy class; Mitchell highlighted the contrast with the England men's team, who regularly flew business class. They held a reception at Lord's in London upon their return, but the former sports minister, Richard Caborn, lamented the low-key celebrations, saying that \"I would have a Number 10 reception, a reception at the House of Commons, and, at the appropriate time, in the Lords.\" In her history of women's cricket, Rafaelle Nicholson was critical of some of the reporting on the final, saying that \"coverage increasingly appears to compare women's cricket with the men's game, and to treat the male version as 'real cricket'\". The English journalists Simon Wilde and Lawrence Booth credited the contracts introduced in 2008 as being critical to England's success. Booth highlighted the contrast with New Zealand's captain, Tiffin, who had retired after the World Cup, claiming: \"If I was paid properly, I'd still be playing.\"\nThe two sides met again three months later to contest the final of the 2009 Women's World Twenty20, which England also won. Each of the top four in the 2009 tournament automatically qualified for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup. Neither England nor New Zealand reached the final of that tournament, but instead met in the third-place playoff, which England won by four wickets."

        "title": "Boxing in Cuba",
        "text": "Boxing is a popular sport in Cuba. As of 1992, there were over 16,000 boxers on the island. Across Cuba today there are 494 boxing coaches and 185 facilities. Of the 99,000 athletes in Cuba currently, 19,000 are boxers, including 81 of Olympic competence, even though only 12 make the Olympic team. Professional boxing was banned from 1962 until April 2022.\nHistory of boxing in Cuba.\nBoxing originally arrived in Cuba as a tourist attraction mainly as championship bouts between North American Boxers during the high tourist season. In 1909 Havana had its first professional fight. In 1910 a Chilean named John Budinich established the first boxing academy in Havana. Two years later government banned boxing due to the violence on the streets between blacks and whites. Boxing matches had to go behind closed doors as it grew popular throughout the island. Despite the banishment of the sport at the time, for the lower classes, boxing constituted a possible ticket out of poverty as well as steady and reliable entertainment.\nA very famous and controversial contest took place in Cuba on April 5, 1915, when Jack Johnson, the world heavyweight champion, defended his title against Jess Willard. Willard won the title by a 26th. round knockout. The fight between the two Americans was controversial because it has been rumored several times that Johnson let Willard win the contest.\nRecognizing boxing's potential to take families out of poverty and to entertain crowds, on December 13, 1921, Cuba decided to give boxing another chance and legitimized boxing with the establishment of the National commission on boxing and Wrestling. The lift on the ban brought tourist dollars with the bouts. Years later a national boxing academy was established to train talented athletes. The next decade Golden Gloves amateur competition had also arrived.\nBy 1959, Cuba had six professional world champions who were considered to be the founding fathers of boxing as well national heroes of Cuba. These fighters included Gerardo “Kid Gavilán” González, Benny Paret, and Eligio “Kid Chocolate” Sardinas. In spite of the sport's promise of prosperity, the Cuban boxers who earned a lot of money in the ring almost commonly died impecunious. Some boxers also had ties with the Mafia and other sources of corruption.\nCuba's boxing reputation also drew foreign boxers as well, such as Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Jess Willard, Joe Louis, Joe Brown, and Sugar Ray Robinson. Although Cuba had traditionally done well in professional boxing, it did not win an Olympic medal in boxing until after 1959 due to considerable resources being devoted to the development of athletes as a result of the Cuban revolution.\nIn 1960, the professional boxer Benny Paret won the world welterweight title, and headed a strong contingent of professional Cuban boxers who followed up their fifth place at the 1954 games (two medals) with a first place, a position they have held in all subsequent Central American Games. In the Pan American games, where the competition was stronger, Cuban boxers also performed well, particularly from the late 1960s onward. The high international standard of Cuba's boxers was evident in the Olympic arena.\nIn 1961, along with other sports, the Revolutionary government banned professional boxing. However, thanks to a huge government financial investment, Cuba has built a reputation in Olympic boxing. At the 1968 Summer Olympics, Cuba won two silver medals. At the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Cuban boxers swept the field, winning ten medals, six of them gold. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, the Cubans outdid themselves, with seven gold and two silver medals.\nBy the 1980s, Cuban boxers were dominant in all major international amateur competitions, including the Olympics. Throughout its Olympic history, Cuba won 37 gold medals (73 overall) in boxing, second place in the all-time medal table. Cuba is the only country that has two three-time Olympic Champions: Teofilo Stevenson and Félix Savón.\nThe ban on professional boxing was lifted in April 2022.\nCuban amateur boxing system.\nForeign influence contributed to the development of Cuban amateur boxing. Before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cuba's achievements in amateur boxing were diminutive. Components of their boxing style were derived from American Professional Boxing. After the Revolution, Eastern European methodology replaced the American influences. Andrei Chervonenko of the Soviet Union has trained Teofilo Stevenson and his compatriot Vasili Romanov has trained boxers as well.\nThe Cuban government used sport as a means of exhibiting the success of the new socialist government, and winning medals in international competitions became a high-profile means of promoting the ideals of new Cuba. The Soviet Union sent experienced boxing coach Andrei Chervonenko to help develop Cuban fighters in order to assist its socialist brethren in their goals. Along with Cuba's own Alcides Sagarra, Chervonenko helped develop a comprehensive national recruiting and training program based on the Soviet model. Alcides Sagarra became Cuba's boxing head coach in 1960 and then later passed on his position to Sarbelio Fuentes in 2001.\nThe Cuban boxing system along with other sports programs start in grammar schools. Sports are considered a high priority in the Cuban education system and it's there a potential athlete can be recognized. From the age of 12, talented youths are sent to specialized schools where they can focus on enhancing their skills. From there the young boxers train throughout a very competitive youth program. The ones that graduate from the program are sent to the top school in Wajay, where they train advanced drills and exercises. The support that the state gives is crucial to the advancement of the highly technical boxing program.\nBoxer Teofilo Stevenson who had won three Olympic gold medals in (1972, 1976, and 1980) has made many contributions to Cuba and Cuban boxing. He is equally known for his sportsmanship, receiving the UNESCO Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play prize in 1989. After retiring in boxing in 1986 he has served both in the Cuban parliament and as a vice president of the Cuban Boxing Federation.\nAfter a career of fighting for their country most Cubans continue to stay in the sport, many as administrators or trainers. Through this way the knowledge and experience is passed down to the next generation of athletes."

        "text": "The 2019 Copa América was the 46th edition of the Copa América, the international men's association football championship organized by South America's football ruling body CONMEBOL. It was held in Brazil and took place between 14 June and 7 July 2019 at 6 venues across the country. This is the first time since 1991 where no CONCACAF nation took part in the tournament.\nHeading into the tournament, Chile were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2015 and 2016 editions of the tournament, but were eliminated by Peru in the semi-finals leading to the third place match against Argentina, which they also lost.\nHost nation Brazil won their ninth title by defeating Peru 3–1 in the final. Argentina took third place by beating Chile 2–1 in the third-place match.\nHost country.\nOriginally, the 2019 Copa América was to be hosted by Chile, while Brazil was due to host the 2015 Copa América, because CONMEBOL normally rotates tournament host nations in alphabetical order. However, because Brazil hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and the 2016 Summer Olympics, Brazil decided against also hosting the 2015 Copa América. Brazil's and Chile's football federations agreed to swap their host nation order for the 2015 and 2019 championships, and CONMEBOL approved this agreement in 2012.\nStarting in 2021 (originally scheduled for 2020), Copa América will be held in the same years as the UEFA European Championship.\nVenues.\nOn 14 June 2018, CBF Vice President Fernando Sarney announced that five cities would host the tournament: Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre. The list of stadia was decided on 17 September 2018. The opening match was held at the Estádio do Morumbi in São Paulo, the semi-finals were held at the Arena do Grêmio in Porto Alegre and Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, and the final was held at the Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. On 23 November 2018, CONMEBOL announced that the second São Paulo venue would be changed from the Allianz Parque to Arena Corinthians.\nTeams.\nApart from all ten CONMEBOL national teams which were eligible to enter, CONMEBOL initially planned to hold a 16-team tournament by inviting six teams from outside CONMEBOL, similar to the Copa América Centenario three years earlier. On 16 March 2018, CONMEBOL announced three teams from CONCACAF and three teams from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) would be invited to participate in the 2019 Copa América. On 12 April 2018, it was announced that Qatar, the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, had accepted the invitation. On 4 May 2018, CONMEBOL announced that the tournament would instead be played with 12 teams, the same number as previous editions since 1993 (apart from the Copa América Centenario held in 2016), with the two guest teams being Qatar and Japan from the AFC. Both teams managed to reach the final of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup held in the UAE, which was won by Qatar.\nQatar made their debut appearance in the Copa América, becoming the first Arab nation to play in the tournament, while Japan made their second appearance, their first since 1999. This was also the first Copa América to not feature any team from CONCACAF since teams had been invited; in particular, Mexico, which competed in all ten editions since 1993 as an invited team, did not participate in this tournament. United States competed in four tournaments, including the 2016 event as host.\nDraw.\nThe draw of the tournament took place on 24 January 2019, 20:30 BRST (), at the Cidade das Artes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The twelve teams were drawn into three groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\nAt the CONMEBOL Council meeting held on 23 November 2018, it was decided that FIFA Ranking would be the basis to determine the seeds and the distribution of the rest of teams in the pots of the draw. This decision will also be valid for future editions of the Copa America.\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based on the FIFA World Ranking of December 2018 (shown in brackets). Pot 1 contained the hosts Brazil (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best two teams, pot 2 contained the next best three teams, and so on for pots 3 and 4. The teams from Pot 1 would be assigned to position 1 in their group, while the teams from Pots 2, 3 and 4 would be drawn to one of the positions 2, 3 or 4 in their group. The two guest teams, Japan and Qatar, which were seeded in different pots, could not be drawn in the same group.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 23 referees and 23 assistant referees were appointed for the tournament on 21 March 2019.\nSquads.\nEach team had to submit a list of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers).\nGroup stage.\nThe match schedule was announced on 18 December 2018. The winners and runners-up of each group and the two best third-placed teams among all groups advanced to the quarter-finals.\nAll times are local, BRT ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was tied after 90 minutes:\nStatistics.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.\nTeam of the Tournament.\nThe Technical Study Group announced the tournament's Best XI squad.\nMarketing.\nMascot.\nThe mascot of the tournament was Zizito, a capybara whose name paid homage to Zizinho, the Brazilian footballer who shared the all-time goal-scoring record in the Copa América (17 goals) with Argentina's Norberto Doroteo Méndez.\nSlogan.\nThe slogan of the 2019 Copa América was \"Vibra el Continente/Vibra o Continente\" (Rocking the Continent).\nOfficial song.\n\"Vibra Continente\" by Brazilian recording artist Léo Santana and Colombian recording artist Karol G served as an official song for the tournament."

Horne, who was in his first and only year. The team played its home games at the Old Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as an independent school. Indiana did not officially compete in basketball as a member of the Western Conference, later known as the Big Ten Conference, until the 1904–1905 season.\nThe Hoosiers finished the regular season with an overall record of 1–4.\nTeam formation.\nDuring the 1900–01 school year, Indiana University officials desired to compete with rival schools in \"basket ball,\" as it was then known. So after the holiday break at the end of 1900, athletic director James H. Horne put out a call for players to try out for the new team. To prepare players participated in drills and scrimmages daily. Horne served as the team's coach and Thomas Records as the team manager. Six of the best players were selected to play varsity.\nRoster.\nIndiana was led in scoring by sophomore captain Ernest Strange. The 1900–1901 season would be the only one for Strange, who died in a boiler explosion in the summer of 1901. Darby, the starting center, would return for the 1901–1902 season as the team's captain, coach, and leading scorer.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=8| Regular Season\nGame summaries.\nButler: February 8.\nIndiana's first official basketball game took place on Friday, February 8, 1901, at 3:00 p.m. when the Hoosiers took on Butler at the Indianapolis YMCA gymnasium. 100 of the team's fans joined them on a train to watch. According to \"Indiana Daily Student\" reports, \"the excitement approached that of an inter-collegiate football contest.\" However, the superior performance of Butler's star forward Carl McGaughey ultimately helped propel Butler to a 20–17 victory.\nButler: February 21.\nIndiana and Butler scheduled a return match-up on Thursday, February 21 in Bloomington. Phelps Darby, who was 5 feet 11 inches tall, had played center in the initial game, but for the re-match he was moved to the forward position so that he could guard Butler's Carl McGaughey. McGaughey still managed to score five field goals in the first half to give Butler a 16–6 advantage at halftime. Indiana rallied behind the play of team captain, Ernest Strange, but still lost 24–20. McGaughey was scoreless in the second half but still led all players with 10 points. For Indiana, Strange and Fitzgerald each had six points.\nPurdue: March 2.\nOn Saturday, March 2 in Bloomington, Indiana played Purdue. The two schools had already developed a fierce rivalry in football. Purdue edged out the Hoosiers in the first half with a 12–10 lead and was able to hold on to the lead with a 20–15 victory. Purdue went on to have a 12–0 season and was considered by some to be the best team in the country; however, Yale won the Helms Foundation award that year.\nWabash: March 8.\nIndiana's fourth game of the year was against Wabash, who traveled to Bloomington on March 8. The game was close after the first half with Indiana ahead 9–8. But in the second half Indiana arguably played its best basketball of the season by scoring 17 points to win by a total score of 26–17.\nDisputed Purdue game.\nIndiana originally planned to play away games at Wabash and Purdue, but according to the \"Arbutus\" (the school yearbook), those games were \"declared off, and the season ended at Indiana.\" The official records of Indiana University and Purdue University indicate that Indiana lost to Purdue 23–19 in West Lafayette on March 15, 1901. However, the \"Indiana University Basketball Encyclopedia\" by Jason Hiner notes that an absence of newspaper reports about the game suggests that it never took place. That source lists the team's record for the inaugural season as 1–3."

        "text": "Vivian Anderson [Sheriffs] (April 21, 1921 – December 21, 2012) was an infielder who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the season. Listed at , 140 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.\nBorn in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Vivian Anderson played with her hometown Milwaukee Chicks in their championship season. Unfortunately, she severely injured two fingers of her throwing hand that shortened her playing career in her rookie year.\nAt age of 13, Vivian began playing softball in a league which required its players to be 16. \"I cheated on my age a little,\" she admitted in an interview. She attended West Division High School in Milwaukee, where she played in the school baseball and basketball teams. In 1942 she married Daniel Anderson, her assistant coach, just when she turned 21 years old. She was spotted by AAGPBL scouts while playing in a Milwaukee league, and sent her an invitation to the league's spring training camp at Peru, Illinois.\n״Andy״, as her teammates nicknamed her, tried out at third base and learned the skills of the game from Chicks' manager Max Carey, to become the first player from her hometown on the Milwaukee team. The strong-armed third sacker was later joined by pitcher Sylvia Wronski, making them the only two Milwaukee natives to play for their hometown Chicks.\nOn May 27, 1944, Anderson started at third base and batted eighth in the order during the Chicks’ inaugural game at Borchert Field, a home contest. She scored the first-ever Chicks’ run, after reaching base on an infield single, in a 5–4, 11-inning loss to the South Bend Blue Sox. But her baseball career ended abruptly in a round trip during her 11th game of the season. \"The ball, the base and the runner all came together at the same time\", she explained. As a result, she fractured her index and middle fingers on her right hand. A doctor advised immediate amputation of her fingers, but another said he could fix them. She would choose the second option, being replaced in the Chicks roster by Doris Tetzlaff.\nMilwaukee clinched the 1944 AAGPBL title with a best-of-seven series victory over the Kenosha Comets. Always a team player who wanted to support her manager and teammates, Anderson accompanied the Chicks to all seven of those games played at Kenosha's Lake Front Stadium, because the Milwaukee Brewers were using Borchert Field for their American Association league playoffs.\nAfter healing, Anderson moved to Chicago and played for the National Girls Baseball League Chicago Bluebirds for the next two years. She then returned to her hometown, eventually landing with the semi-professional Milwaukee Jets. She divorced her husband after World War II and worked for Allied Van Lines moving company in office management, the secretarial field, public relations, loan closing, dispatching, and credit/collections. At age 83, she worked part-time in an office, namely for a national furniture mover, Barrett Moving and Storage Co., agent for United Van Lines, just to keep busy, before retiring in 2010 at the age of 89.\nIn her spare time, Anderson continued to be active in sports playing field hockey and basketball. Also a talented bowler for 50 years, she belonged to the local 600 club.\nShe is part of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Besides this, in 2001 she was honored by having her name added to the Wall of Honor inside Miller Park, home of the National League Milwaukee Brewers, during what turned out to be the first induction in the ballpark. The same year she participated in the SABR convention held in Milwaukee.\nVivian Anderson never left her hometown area and continued to live in her own home as late as 2012.\nCareer statistics.\nBatting\nFielding"

The team was led by third year head coach Glenn Braica, who is the reigning NEC head coach of the year. The Terrier's home games were played at the Generoso Pope Athletic Complex. They also played 2 games at the new Barclays Center in Downtown Brooklyn against Long Island in a neutral site match up and St. John's in the inaugural Brooklyn Hoops Winter Festival. The team has been a member of the Northeast Conference since 1981. They finished the season at 12–18 overall and 8–10 in the NEC to finish in eighth place, which qualified them for the NEC Basketball Tournament. They lost in the quarterfinals of the Northeast Conference Basketball tournament to number one seed Robert Morris.\nSeason outlook.\nIn Glenn Braica's first two seasons the Terriers have made the NEC tournament. Going into this season Braica has a combined 30–30 record and is coming off of winning the 2012 NEC Coach of the Year Trophy. Last year the Terriers earned the fourth seed in the conference and hosted their first home playoff game since 1997. For the 2012–2013 season, Braica's Terriers were selected to finish fifth by the Northeast Conference men's basketball coaches. The Terriers had four of their five starters returning for the season. The only loss in the starting five was swingman and three-point specialist Stefan Perunicic.\nPerunicic is the program's second-leading three-point shooter of all-time. The Terriers also lost guard Justin Newton to graduation. Yet the Terriers saw the return of former starting guard Dre Calloway, who missed most of last season after having season-ending shoulder surgery in November 2011.\nThe Terriers returned four starters: Jalen Cannon, Akeem Johnson, Brent Jones and Ben Mockford. Power forward Jalen Cannon was selected to the 2012 NEC All-Rookie team and led the team in rebounding with 8.8 per game. Cannon also recorded 8 double-doubles. Forward-center Akeem Johnson had 3 20+ point games and started 26 out of 30 games. Johnson was also one of the more efficient players in the Northeast Conference with a 55% field goal mark. Point guard Brent Jones was last year's assists leader, averaging 3.9 per game. Jones took over the starting job down the stretch last year, starting 12 of the last 13 contests. Shooting guard Ben Mockford led the team in scoring with 11.8 points per game and started all 30 contests last year.\nPreseason signings.\nThe Terriers announced that 6 ft 3 in combo guard Anthony White (Mastic, New York) and 6'4\" shooting guard Aleksandar Isailovic (Belgrade, Serbia) had signed National Letters-of-Intent to enroll at the college in fall 2012. Anthony White came from William Floyd High School, where in his junior year he led his team in points, rebounds and assists. White was also an All-League selection, All-Conference, All-Suffolk County and was selected to the Newsday All-Long Island Team. Aleksander Isailovic is arriving from Collin College in Plano, Texas. Isailovic averaged 10.5 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 0.7 steals per game last season at Collin Community College and will have two years of eligibility as a Terrier.\nRegular season.\nFor the second season in a row the Terriers opened their season mostly on the road, as they played 8 of their first 11 games away from The Pope. The Terriers completed the non-conference portion of their schedule at 4–7. The team won the season opener against Lafayette on the road, with four of the five Terrier starters scoring double digits. Jalen Cannon notched his first double-double of the season with 13 points and 13 rebounds and the Terriers led by a much as 17 on their way to a 76–65 win. The Terriers snapped a three-game losing streak against the Leopards and also won for the first time on opening night since November 9, 2007. The Terriers then lost to Illinois 64–89. The Illini were the Terriers most difficult opponent all year long, they went on to be ranked as high as 10th in the nation by the AP and Coaches Polls. The Terriers home opener at The Pope was against Army, the game saw the Terriers defeated 59–67. The Terriers closed the first half down by one point, 30–31, yet they never led in the second half as the Black Knights soundly defeated the Terriers. Jalen Cannon scored a career-high 23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and classmate Kevin Douglas added 15 points and rejected a career-high three shots in the losing effort. The Terriers then traveled to Rhode Island to play at Brown, where they beat the Bears 76–72 in overtime. Mockford scored 8 of his 14 points in overtime to lead the Terriers in the victory. After a 2–2 start, the Terriers went on to lose 5 straight games against Norfolk State, Albany, Boston College, Stony Brook and St. John's. Against both Norfolk State and Boston College the Terriers had second-half leads of 11 and 9 points respectively, but in both cases were unable to hold on for the win. Against Albany, Stony Brook and St. John's, the Terriers were soundly defeated. The Terriers then won their last two non-conference games against Colgate and NJIT. The game against Colgate saw Jalen Cannon drop 24 points, a new career high, and Travis Nichols 20 points off the bench. At NJIT, Johnson had the game-winning layup with five seconds remaining and Cannon put up 23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for his 5th double-double of the season.\nThe Terriers then beat Quinnipiac, to extend their winning streak to three games and win their first game of the conference schedule. The Terriers went on to finish conference play at 8–10 and qualify for the NEC tournament with the 8th seed. Their next game, at Sacred Heart, saw the Terriers lose in the final seconds of the contest 65–66, even though Cannon poured in 20 points and grabbed 16 rebounds for his 6th double-double. Against Mount St. Mary's the Terriers were led by Ben Mockford's 19 point performance to win 70–56. In that game 4 Terriers were in double figures for points scored. At Wagner, the Terriers who were underdogs beat the Seahawks by 19 points, 71–52. For the first time all season Coach Braica had to change his starting 5 by starting Aleksandar Isailovic in place of Kevin Douglas, who has an injured right hand. Travis Nichols came off the bench to score 20 points and grab 6 rebounds, which contributed to the Seahawks first loss at home this season. After the Terriers opened conference play at 3–1, they went on to go 5–9 in their next 14 contest. The Terriers lost 2 games a piece to Monmouth and Long Island, including the Battle of Brooklyn game. Down the stretch Mockford scored a career high 29 points against Mount St. Mary's and Kevin Douglas did not return to the line-up until the last game of the regular season against Sacred Heart. St. Francis Brooklyn has struggled closing out games this season. The Terriers have held a second-half lead in 22 of their 27 contests this season (exceptions are Illinois, Army, St. John's, Stony Brook, and Mount St. Mary's). St. Francis has held a second-half lead in 16 of 18 NEC contests but are just 8–10.\nNEC tournament.\nThe 8th-seed Terriers traveled to 1st seed Robert Morris and lost 57–75; they were led by sophomore Jalen Cannon (15 points, 6 rebs).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:white;\"| NEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0038A8; border: 2px solid #CE1126;;color:white;\"| 2013 NEC Tournament\nSeason statistics.\n "

Top favourites Sven Nys and Bart Wellens took an early lead breaking away from the pack, but were set back by bad luck as they were brought down by a plastic block that was touched by a television motorcycle. Both continued the race, but had to chase the leaders from behind. Due to the incident defending champion Erwin Vervecken was the only leader with a small gap to the rest of the peloton. Vervecken fell as well however, as he was trying to climb up a hill and was overtaken by Richard Groenendaal who took the initiative and looked secure to win his second world title, with the big favourites way behind. Groenendaal however also crashed and Italian champion Enrico Franzoi together with Jonathan Page were in the lead. Vervecken in the meanwhile was slightly behind the two and came back. Franzoi couldn't keep up driving through the sand and was set back and had to fight for his bronze medal. In the final lap both leaders tried to create a gap several times, but were taken back by the other. Until Vervecken had an excellent line choice on the last major climb of the course before the finish. Doing so shot him past Page as he went on to successfully defend his world title. Franzoi was able to hold his third position for the bronze medal, while Bart Wellens came in fourth with what was later reported a broken wrist.\nRanking.\nSeven riders abandoned the race: Kamil Ausbuher (Czech Republic), Davy Commeyne (Belgium), Mohamed Conway (Zimbabwe), Masahiko Mifune (Japan), Tshabalala Nqobizitha (Zimbabwe), Radomír Šimůnek (Czech Republic), Malte Urban (Germany) and Camiel Van Den Bergh (Netherlands).

        "text": "Pablo Javier Ortega Salinas (born November 7, 1976) is a Mexican former professional baseball pitcher. He played in the Mexican League, minor league baseball and Mexico national baseball team.\nCareer.\nOrtega debuted in 1995 with his hometown Nuevo Laredo Tecolotes, going 0–1 with a 5.93 ERA in five games at age 18. Signed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before the organization had a major league team, he was one of their top farm players in 1996. He went 4–6 with a 1.97 ERA for the Gulf Coast Devil Rays and struck out 86 in 82 innings while allowing only 61 hits and 12 walks. He was 6th in the Gulf Coast League in ERA and led in innings pitched. He was second to Jeriome Robertson in strikeouts. \"Baseball America\" rated him as the #5 Devil Rays prospect.\nIn 1996, the right-hander went 12–10 with a 2.86 ERA for the 60-82 Charleston RiverDogs, allowing only 30 walks in 189 innings while striking out 142. He led Devil Rays farmhands in innings pitched and ERA. He paced the South Atlantic League in innings and starts (29) and was 8th in the SAL in ERA. Ortega struggled in 1998 with the St. Petersburg Devil Rays, going 5–9 with a 4.40 ERA and allowing 187 hits in 155 innings.\nPablo led Tampa Bay farmhands in 1999 with 13 losses, splitting time between St. Petersburg (1-2, 1.93), the Orlando Rays (8-10, 3.87) and the Durham Bulls (0-1, 34.71 in one atrocious start). In the winter of 1999–2000, Ortega was with the Venados de Mazatlán and was 4–6 with a 3.08 ERA, battling rare control problems (44 BB in 76 IP).\nOrtega's control did not return in 2000 with the Tigres Capitalinos but he still was 11–3 with a 4.34 ERA. He was MVP of the finals as he went 2–0 with a 0.93 ERA. In 2001, he fell to 5–9, 5.21 with the Tigres. He had a great winter in 2001–2002, going 4–5 with 2 saves and a 2.40 ERA for Mazatlán. He was 9th in the Mexican Pacific League in ERA.\nOrtega had another rough summer in 2002, with a 3–7, 6.94 record between Mexico City and the Puebla Parrots. The next year was a vast improvement as he went 13–4 with a 3.14 ERA for the Angelopolis Tigers. His accuracy was back as he walked 46 in 161 innings of work. He was named Pitcher of the Year and the Tigers had the best record in the regular season.\nHe was nearly unbeatable for the 2003–2004 Venados de Mazatlán, going 9–1 with a 2.40 ERA. He was one win behind Mexican Pacific League leader Francisco Campos and was 7th in ERA. Moving to the Monterrey Sultans that summer, he had a 6–2, 3.36 record.\nOrtega led Mazatlán in 2004–2005, now going 9–3 with a 2.88 ERA, one win behind LMPB leader Jorge Campillo. Ortega was 5th in the league in ERA. Mazatlán made it to the 2005 Caribbean Series and pulled off a title. Ortega helped, going 1–0 with a 1.13 ERA to team with Campos and Campillo for a fine trio on the hill.\nIn the regular season, Ortega was 8–5 with a 4.45 ERA for the Tigers. The winter of 2005–2006 was semisweet – his record was 4-5 but his 2.49 ERA was second only to Spike Lundberg. Mazatlán went 35-32 even though their top two hurlers, Ortega and Campos, combined to go 8–11. In the 2006 Caribbean Series, he allowed two runs in nine innings in a no-decision against Puerto Rico.\nOrtega was a strong performer in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, striking out five in four scoreless innings for Mexico. The Angelopolis hurler had a wretched 2006 Mexican League season, with a 5–6, 6.27 record and allowing 121 hits in 95 innings. He still was put on the Mexican squad for the 2006 COPABE Olympic Qualifier and was their top hurler. He went 2–0 with a 0.54 ERA. In 16 2/3 IP, Ortega struck out 22 while allowing only 10 hits and 2 walks. He was third in the tournament in ERA behind Frank Montieth and Norberto González. He was one win behind leader Rafael Díaz and was one strikeout behind Adiel Palma. In the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, Pablo had a 0.79 ERA in 3 games for Mexico, which won Bronze.\nThe right-hander had a 7–6, 3.29 record for the 2006–2007 Venados, finishing 6th in the LMP in ERA. He was smacked around in the 2007 Caribbean Series, going 0–2 with a 12.79 ERA, twice losing to the champion Águilas Cibaeñas. In the 2007 Pan American Games, Ortega allowed five baserunners but only one run in 2 2/3 IP, striking out three in two relief stints.\nWith the Tigres de Quintana Roo in 2007, Ortega posted a mark of 12–3, 2.38 with only 91 hits and 28 walks in 113 1/3 innings. He lost Pitcher of the Year honors to Nerio Rodríguez. He went 5–4 with a 2.86 ERA for Mazaltan in 2007–2008, walking 20 and allowing 75 hits in 94 1/3 innings.\nIn the 2008 Final Olympic Qualification Tournament, the 31-year-old was 1–1 with a 3.18 ERA. He took the loss against Taiwan but then shut down Germany to win a pitching duel with Enorbel Márquez.\nOrtega went 11–5 with a 3.05 ERA for the 2008 Tigres, with 28 walks in 121 innings. He was 10th in the league in ERA and tied for fifth in wins. He topped 100 career wins. In the 2008 Americas Baseball Cup, Pablo went 2–0 with a 0.84 ERA, again finishing 10th in ERA, while tying for 8th in wins. He led the event with 3 wild pitches.\nFor Mazatlán in the 2009 Caribbean Series, he started a win over the Ponce Lions but got a no-decision; he allowed one run in 6 1/3 IP despite nine hits and three walks. Ortega allowed 5 runs in 4 2/3 IP in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He lasted just two innings in his only start, against Cuba. For the summer of 2009, Pablo was 13–5 with a 3.19 ERA for Quintana Roo. He tied Roberto Ramírez for second in the Mexican League in wins, behind Andres Meza. He was also 7th in ERA.\nOrtega was 1–1 with a 4.00 ERA in the 2010 Caribbean Series, doing well in a win over the Leones del Caracas but struggling in a loss to the Indios de Mayagüez. He had a rough summer at 2–6, 8.24 in 2010. He started 2011 back in form (10-3, 3.29) with the Tigres de Quintana Roo. On July 24, 2011, he threw a no-hitter against the Rojos del Águila de Veracruz, keeping a perfect game until he issued a walk with one out in the 9th."

        "text": "The 2012 State of Origin series was the 31st time the annual best-of-three series between the Queensland and New South Wales rugby league teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' rules. For the fourth successive year a Queensland victory set a new record for consecutive State of Origin titles, reaching seven. \nGame I was played at Melbourne's sold out Etihad Stadium and won by Queensland; its television broadcast watched by more than 2.5 million viewers, rating it as the most-watched State of Origin broadcast since the introduction of OzTAM ratings in 1999. New South Wales' series-equalling win in Game II, played at Sydney's sold out ANZ Stadium, set a new TV ratings record for most-watched second game of any series in State of Origin history. The decider, Game III was played at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium and was won by Queensland. This game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001.\nIn 2012, the first year of the independent Australian Rugby League Commission, a new rule was put into place that would set out earlier in a player's career which was his state of origin. For the second successive year, Queensland hosted Game III and New South Wales hosted Game II; typically the states would alternate the hosting of these games.\nRicky Stuart stepped down as New South Wales head coach after the series in August, shortly after signing a contract to coach the Parramatta Eels from 2013 onwards. Later in the year New South Wales' player of the series was named: hooker Robbie Farah.\n2012 also saw the inaugural Under 20s State of Origin match which was played at Centerbet Stadium, with New South Wales taking out the Darren Lockyer Shield against Queensland.\nGame I.\nThe opening game for the New South Wales Blues saw Todd Carney, James Tamou, Tony Williams and Jamie Buhrer make their debuts, with all either having previous international representative or grand final experience. Michael Jennings was the first Origin player in 29 years to be selected to the squad after playing in the reserve grades, where he was dropped from the Penrith Panthers for one game due to poor off-field discipline. Jamie Buhrer from the Manly Sea Eagles was generally the shock selection in the squad, only playing for City Origin earlier in the year as his sole representative honour and was yet to play 50 games for his club, but was selected due to his big game experience, having played in Manly's winning 2011 NRL Grand Final team, and his high utility value to replace their recognised utility in Kurt Gidley who was unable to play in the 2012 series to due a season-long injury. Only 9 of the selected 17 players were incumbent from Game Three in 2011.\nQueensland's selected side for the first game was largely unchanged from the 2011 series, with only four changes made. Their only debutant was Matt Gillett from the Brisbane Broncos to play a utility role from the bench. It was hooker Cameron Smith's first match and series as the permanent captain for his state, having previously filled in for the role only in Darren Lockyer's absence.\n1st half\nNew South Wales held most of the momentum early in the match, and scored first through winger Akuila Uate in the sixth minute of the match, who recovered a bomb kick and scored in the corner; Todd Carney missed the conversion and New South Wales led 4–0. In the twenty-first minute, a brawl erupted; Blues centre Michael Jennings, who ran some distance to leap into the brawl and punch Brent Tate in the head, was sent to the sin bin for ten minutes. The Maroons scored shortly afterwards, with winger Darius Boyd touching down in the corner and Johnathan Thurston converting to give Queensland a 6–4 lead. Boyd scored again in the thirty-eighth minute, and another successful conversion from Thurston gave Queensland a 12–4 lead at halftime.\n2nd half\nNew South Wales added points early in the second half, with Jennings scoring a try from a bomb kick; Carney's successful conversion brought the score to 12–10. New South Wales had most of the attack during the second half, but Queensland was able to defend its goal-line and prevent the Blues from scoring; and in the fifty-second minute, Carney narrowly missed a long-range penalty goal attempt which would have levelled the scores at twelve apiece, but after seventy minutes, Queensland still led 12–10. After a repeat set of six in the seventy-third minute, Maroons' centre Greg Inglis crossed the line in controversial circumstances: after recovering the ball from a cross-field kick, Inglis lost control of the ball when it contacted the boot of Blues' hooker Robbie Farah, before regathering and grounding in goal. After a lengthy review, the video referee awarded a try: he ruled that Farah had intentionally played at and kicked the ball out of Inglis' hands, and that Inglis' loss of control was therefore not a knock-on. The try was converted, and there was no further score, giving Queensland 18–10 victory. The decision to award the try to Inglis was highly controversial. Blues captain Paul Gallen argued vehemently with the referee onfield following the decision, although was more circumspect after the match. Inglis' controversial try saw him pass Dale Shearer to become the all-time leading try scorer in State of Origin football. Michael Jennings received a one-match suspension for the punch for which he was sin-binned during the match. It was Queensland's fourth Game One victory in a row, the first time either team had achieved the feat.\nAfter the controversial Inglis try call, and others during the game, New South Wales coach Ricky Stuart asked his players not to give interviews to media in the lead-up to Game II, although the ban was lifted after two days. The decision was officially endorsed by referees' coach Bill Harrigan the following day.\nGame II.\nThe two players to enter the New South Wales squad for the second game of the series were Anthony Watmough and Tim Grant, with Grant making his debut. Grant was included to partner James Tamou as starting props, with captain Paul Gallen moved back to his preferred position at lock and Greg Bird subsequently shifted to second row with Luke Lewis to the bench to replace Jamie Buhrer. Watmough replaces Tony Williams who was not selected due to a sustained injury. The announced Queensland side remained unchanged, however afterwards Sam Thaiday was forced to withdraw due to injury and was replaced by David Taylor, allowing Corey Parker to enter the squad.\n1st half\nGame 2 saw a very physical contest between the two sides. New South Wales dominated possession, and Brett Stewart scored the first try of the game in the corner after around 25 minutes, giving New South Wales a 4–0 lead. A late converted try by Ben Hannant after a bomb kick was misread by the New South Wales backline saw Queensland lead 6–4 at half-time.\n2nd half\nTwo minutes into the second half, Cooper Cronk was sin-binned for a professional foul which denied Todd Carney the opportunity to score under the posts from a grubber kick; Carney converted a penalty goal to level the scores at 6–6. Billy Slater and Corey Parker then suffered game-changing injuries as the Maroons struggled to keep up with the Blues' pace. New South Wales scored two quick tries during Cronk's period in the sin bin, with both Brett Stewart scoring a 50-metre try following a break by Carney, and Josh Morris scoring after a break by Jarryd Hayne. Johnathan Thurston had stripped Hayne of the ball which travelled forward, Morris picked the ball up and out paced Greg Inglis in a 40-metre sprint to score; this gave New South Wales a 16–6 lead. From there, Queensland began to have the better of possession, and won several repeat sets from goal-line dropouts. Greg Inglis scored a try in the 62nd minute, the conversion bringing the score back to 16–12. Brent Tate almost scored a try in the 70th minute, but Michael Jennings knocked the ball out of his grasp in the in-goal area to save the try. There were no further points in the game, and New South Wales won the game 16–12, to level the series.\nGame III.\nInjury concerns to both squads forced their respective coaches to name extended squads for the decider. Glenn Stewart was the main injury concern for New South Wales, as was Billy Slater likewise for Queensland. Both players were not available for the game. For NSW, Beau Scott replaced the injured Stewart whilst Brett Morris was chosen over Akuila Uate and Tony Williams returned replacing Trent Merrin.\nGreg Inglis was selected to replace Slater, although Matthew Bowen and Darius Boyd were also considered as replacements. Inglis's centre spot was filled by Dane Nielson whilst Corey Parker took Ashley Harrison's lock position, as Harrison was ruled out from injury. Sam Thaiday returned to the run-on squad and Ben Te'o was considered over David Taylor on the bench.\nNew South Wales scored first with a penalty goal by Todd Carney, and then ran in the first try of the match in the 13th minute, scored by Brett Morris and converted by Carney, for an early lead of 8 points to nil. Queensland's Darius Boyd scored out wide after 19 minutes from a cut-out pass from Johnathan Thurston. Thirteen minutes later, from deep in Queensland's half, Thurston broke through an attempted Mitchell Pearce tackle and raced 35m up field before finding Brent Tate and Cooper Cronk in support; two tackles later Thurston accepted an offload from Corey Parker to score close to the posts. New South Wales then kicked the restart into touch on the full and three tackles later Justin Hodges scored a controversial try beside the posts, after calls from New South Wales players for obstruction were denied by the video referee. Thurston converted his own and Hodges' tries, and the score at the half-time break was 16–8 in favour of the Maroons.\nSeven minutes into the second half, Brett Stewart pounced on a Robbie Farah grubber kick into the Queensland in-goal and scored his third try of the series for the Blues just before the ball went dead; Carney converted the try to reduce the margin to 16–14. The next two scores were both Queensland penalty goals kicked by Thurston, one in the 49th minute and one in the 64th minute, to make the score 20–14. In the 70th minute, Josh Morris scored a try in the corner following a perfectly placed cross-field kick by Robbie Farah, Morris showing great skill to out-jump Darius Boyd and score before sliding into touch; Todd Carney then converted the kick from the sideline to even up the match at 20 points each. Maroons halfback Cooper Cronk kicked a field goal from 40m out to put Queensland ahead by one point with six minutes remaining. Mitchell Pearce then missed a long-range field goal in the final minute to give the Maroons a one-point victory, and their seventh successive State of Origin series victory. Nate Myles was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal for best player in the series while Johnathan Thurston, playing his 24th consecutive Origin match since debut, won his fifth Man of the Match award.\nJohnathan Thurston's try in the 32nd minute of Game III saw him pass former New South Wales player Michael O'Connor (1985–91) as the second highest point scorer in Origin history.\nThis game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001, and the 2nd highest OzTam-rated television audience in Australian television history (Games 1 and 2 were the 5th and 6th most watched respectively). This includes a record 421,000 viewership in Melbourne for Game 3, more than all the previous month's Friday Night AFL matches, and up 100,000 from the previous record set for Game 2.\nTeams.\nThe 18th &amp; 19th man are reserves to cover for any forthcoming injuries and, unless chosen, do not actually play.\nNew South Wales Blues.\n1 - Tariq Sims was originally selected but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Aaron Woods.&lt;br&gt;\n2 - Glenn Stewart was originally selected to play but withdrew due to injury. He was replaced by Beau Scott.\nQueensland Maroons.\nQueensland's team for the 2012 campaign featured one débutante in Brisbane utility Matt Gillett. No changes were made to the successful Game I team until Sam Thaiday was forced out when a shoulder injury failed to respond to treatment before Game II. This brought David Taylor into the starting side and Corey Parker onto the bench.\n1 - Sam Thaiday was originally selected to play but withdrew due to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by interchange forward David Taylor whilst Corey Parker was called onto the bench.\n2 - Billy Slater was originally selected to play but withdrew due to a knee injury sustained during Game II. He was replaced by Greg Inglis whilst Dane Nielson came into the centres for Inglis.\nUnder-20s.\nThe 2012 Under 20s State of Origin was the introduction of the State Of Origin concept to the Holden Cup. New South Wales win the inaugural Darren Lockyer Shield."

Also, the toeboard is raised, so you can feel it with your toes, and the dart board has a voice that announces all the things that are typically displayed in lites. Sighted spotters are used to announce the position of darts that miss the board and help find dart that fall on the floor.\nHistory.\nIn 1988 the Braille Sports Foundation (BSF), whose mission is to increase accessibility for individuals with visual impairment, was looking for a way for people with visual impairments to participate in the game of darts. After approximately one year of research and development, an Audio English Mark Dart machine was created. This machine enabled unsighted people to effectively compete in the game of darts against sighted and unsighted opponents. Arachnid made only 50 of Audio English Mark Dart machines and not many of them still exist.\nDMI's e750, licensed from Arachnid, speaks almost enough to play blind.\nThe Audio Dart Master was introduced in 2009 with full voice functionality.\nLeagues.\nThe game is played in a few leagues.\nTwin Cities Audio Dart League.\nThe Twin Cities Blind Audio Dart League is organized to promote darts in a recreational, competitive community setting for disabled and non-disabled persons."

        "text": "Kapil Dev is a former Test and One Day International (ODI) cricketer who represented India between 1978 and 1994. He took 24 five-wicket hauls during his international career. In cricket, a five-wicket haul—also known as a five-for or fifer—refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and fewer than 40 bowlers have taken more than 15 five-wicket hauls at international level in their cricketing careers. A right-arm fast bowler, Kapil Dev took 434 wickets in Test cricket and 253 in ODIs. With 23 five-wicket hauls in Tests, he has the third highest number of international five-wicket hauls among Indian cricketers as of 2012, after Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. Kapil Dev was named by the \"Wisden\" as one of their Cricketers of the Year in 1983 and Indian Cricketer of the Century in 2002. Eight years later, the International Cricket Council (ICC) inducted him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. As of 2012, Kapil Dev also holds the record for being the only player to have taken more than 400 wickets and scored over 5,000 runs in Tests.\nKapil Dev made his Test and ODI debuts against Pakistan, both in 1978. His first five-wicket haul came a year later against England during the first Test of India's tour. His career-best bowling figures in an innings of nine for 83 was achieved in 1983 against the West Indies in Ahmedabad. In Tests, Kapil Dev was most successful against Pakistan and Australia, with seven five-wicket hauls against each of them. He took his only five-wicket haul in ODIs against Australia during the 1983 Cricket World Cup.\nAfter playing for nearly 16 years, Kapil Dev retired from international cricket in 1994. At the time of his retirement, he held the world record for the most wickets taken in Test and ODI cricket; both records were subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh and Wasim Akram respectively. His combined tally of 24 five-wicket hauls is eleventh in the all-time list in 2012, a record jointly held with Sydney Barnes, Imran Khan and Dennis Lillee."

        "text": "The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was a circuit that began to operate in 1943. Since the only organized ball for women in the United States was softball, the league officials created a hybrid game which included features of both fast-pitch softball and baseball. Compared to softball, the crucial differences were that nine (not ten) players were used, and runners could lead off, slide and steal bases. \nIn its twelve years of history the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League evolved through many stages. These differences varied from the beginning of the league, progressively extending the length of the base paths and pitching distance, while decreasing the size of the ball until the final year of play in 1954. \nFor the first five years the circuit used a fastpitch underhand motion, shifted to sidearm in the 1947 season, and overhand pitching began in 1948."

Technically, just a minimum of one second in silo (1-59) would count as one minute of playing time. For example, there are forty-eight minutes in each NBA basketball game, excluding overtime. As five people from one team will be on the court at any given time, a total of 240 minutes can be distributed in regulation among a team in an NBA basketball game.\nFor players, the total number of minutes played in a season—and the average number of minutes played per game—are both tracked as statistics.\nLeaders.\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all-time leader in minutes played with 57,446. LeBron James (active), Karl Malone (54,852), Dirk Nowitzki (51,368), Kevin Garnett (50,418), Jason Kidd (50,111), and Elvin Hayes (50,000) are the only other players with 50,000 or more minutes played in a career. Most of Abdul-Jabbar and Hayes's minutes can largely be attributed to the amount of playing time that star players had in the late 1960s and early-to-mid 1970s. Abdul-Jabbar played 40 or more minutes per game from the to the , while Hayes played 40 or more minutes per game from the to the and from the to the . \nWilt Chamberlain holds the record for most minutes played in the NBA in one season with 3,882, set in the ."

The team compiled a record of 10–13, and 3–9 against Big Ten Conference opponents. The University of Chicago won the Big Ten championship with a 10–2 record in conference play. Michigan finished in seventh place out of ten teams. E. J. Mather was in his first year as the team's coach, and Ralph O. Rychener was the team captain.\nThe 1920 \"Michiganensian\" wrote that Jack Williams was \"the outstanding individual player of the 1920 season\" and noted that he led a late season rally. Arthur Karpus was the team's leading scorer with 75 points in eight conference games on 22 field goals and 31 free throws. R. Jerome Dunne was the second leading scorer with 54 points in 12 games on 27 field goals and zero free throws. Walter B.

Benjamin Weiss ranked fourth in scoring with 18 points on seven field goals and four free throws in seven conference games.\nIn November 1919, \"The Michigan Alumnus\" announced the hiring of E. J. Mather as the new head basketball coach and assistant coach in football and baseball. Mather had been a three-sport athlete at Lake Forest College in Illinois and thereafter became the athletic director at Kalamazoo College. His basketball teams won the M.I.A.A. championship in all five seasons that Mather was there. With the hiring of Mather, Elmer Mitchell became Michigan's director of intramural athletics and athletic editor of \"The Michigan Alumnus\". Mitchell published an article titled, \"The Game of Basketball\" in the January 1920 issue of the \"Alumnus\". Mitchell wrote that basketball was Michigan's newest varsity sport and ranked fourth in popularity behind football, baseball, and track. He noted that basketball at Michigan was \"fighting an uphill game to strengthen its prestige\" and had features that were \"practically unknown to the Michigan following.\" Mather began pre-season workouts in November with a squad of approximately 35 candidates."

It is the home of the Cricket Club of India and has played host to Ranji Trophy matches (including seventeen finals) and Indian Premier League matches, as well as being a Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) venue. It has a capacity of 20,000 spectators. The ground has hosted 18 Test matches, the first in 1948 when India played the West Indies. It has also staged nine ODI matches, the first of which was in 1989 when Australia lost to Pakistan by 66 runs. One T20I has been played at the ground when India beat Australia by seven wickets in 2007. This was also the first T20I to be played in India. Of the nine ODIs played at the stadium, five matches (including the final) were staged during the ICC Champions Trophy in 2006.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement. The first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at Brabourne Stadium was Prior Jones in 1949, for the West Indies against India. The first Indian to take a five-wicket haul in a Test at the Brabourne was Vinoo Mankad, who did so in a game against Pakistan in 1952. B. S. Chandrasekhar is the only bowler to have taken two five-wicket hauls in Test matches at the ground, doing so against the West Indies in 1966 and against England in 1973. Chandrasekhar is also the only bowler to have taken ten wickets in a match at Brabourne, he took eleven wickets against the West Indies in 1966. Twelve bowlers have taken thirteen five-wicket hauls at the ground. Sri Lankan bowler Farveez Maharoof's five wicket haul against the West Indies in 2006, is the only one achieved during an ODI. Khaleel Ahmed's three wickets for thirteen runs in an ODI versus West Indies in 2018 are the best figures by an Indian at the ground in the fifty over format. The best bowling figures in the only T20I staged at the ground featuring India and Australia in 2007 are Irfan Pathan's two wickets for thirty-four runs."

        "text": "Bob Daniels is an American ice hockey coach, currently in charge at Ferris State, a position he has held since 1992.\nCareer.\nDaniels began his coaching career shortly after graduating from Michigan State with a BA in accounting, becoming the head coach for the Hennessey Engineers of the Great Lakes Junior Hockey League. After three seasons in Plymouth, Michigan, Daniels returned to college, this time attending Miami University and earning a Master's in sports organization while serving as a graduate assistant for the RedHawks in 1986–87. The next season saw Daniels as a full-time college assistant for Illinois-Chicago and in his second season the Flames saw their best performance, finishing 3rd in the CCHA and advancing out of the first round in the conference tournament for the first time. After the two-year stint Daniels moved back to Michigan, becoming an assistant at Ferris State under John Perpich.\nAfter a disappointing season in 1989–90 Bob Mancini replaced Perpich but Daniels was retained as an assistant. The first season under the new coach saw the Bulldogs post their first 20-win season in a decade but then slipped back under .500 in 1991–92. Mancini left to take over at Michigan Tech, leaving the door open for Daniels to take the reins.\nIn his first season leading the team Daniels got the Bulldogs to another 20-win campaign, but it would be six more years before he could provide the Ferris State faithful win another winning season. Daniels' continued on in his position despite the lack of consistent success and rewarded the Bulldogs with their first 30-win season in 2002–03. Ferris State won its first regular season conference title that year and fell one game short of its first conference tournament championship, falling to Michigan 5–3 in the final. With their superb record, Ferris State received an at-large bid to the 2003 NCAA Tournament, their first appearance in the championship, and downed perennial power North Dakota in the regional semifinal before being eliminated. Daniels coached his first Hobey Baker Award finalist in 2003 and while Chris Kunitz failed to capture the award, Daniels himself received both the CCHA Coach of the Year and Spencer Penrose Award.\nOver the course of the next decade the Bulldogs hovered around the .500 mark until 2011–12 when Daniels got Ferris State its second regular season title, and NCAA Tournament appearance. The 2012 Tournament saw a better result for the team as they won each of their first three games while allowing only 1 goal in each game. They could not stop the #1 overall seed Boston College Eagles from taking the crown, losing 4–1 in the championship game. The season did finish with a silver lining as Daniels received his second CCHA Coach of the Year and Spencer Penrose Awards.\nThe following season was Ferris State's last in the CCHA when the conference dissolved after the realignment resulting from the formation of the Big Ten. They joined the WCHA beginning in 2013–14 and got off to a fast start, winning the regular season title with a 29-win year and making their third NCAA berth, losing a double overtime game to North Dakota in the regional finals. For his efforts Daniels was awarded the WCHA Coach of the Year Award."

This poll is compiled by sportswriters across the nation. In Division I men's and women's college basketball, the AP Poll is largely just a tool to compare schools throughout the season and spark debate, as it has no bearing on postseason play. Generally, all top 25 teams in the poll are invited to the NCAA basketball tournament, also known as \"March Madness\".\nESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked #1; second highest is ranked #2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first place votes noted the quantity next to their name. Any team receiving votes after the top 25 are listed after the top 25 by their point totals. However, these are not real rankings: They are not considered #26, #27, etc. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775. The preseason poll was released on November 6, 2007."

        "text": "The 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2012–13 season. They began on April 30, 2013, following the conclusion of the regular season. The regular season was shortened to 48 games and the playoffs were pushed to a later date due to a lockout. The playoffs ended on June 24, 2013, with the Chicago Blackhawks defeating the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games to win the Stanley Cup. Patrick Kane won the Conn Smythe trophy as the playoffs MVP, with 19 points (9 goals and 10 assists).\nThe Blackhawks made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Detroit Red Wings increased their postseason appearance streak to twenty-two seasons, the longest active streak at the time. The Toronto Maple Leafs made the playoffs for the first time since 2004, breaking the longest active drought at the time. The 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs marked the first time since 1996 that every Original Six team advanced to the playoffs in the same year. Additionally, four Canadian teams qualified for the playoffs (Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver), the most since 2006. The first round series between Montreal and Ottawa was the first playoff series between two Canadian teams since 2004. For the second time in three years, all three teams from California made the playoffs. For the first time since 2007, and for only the third time in history, \"all\" four former WHA teams; Carolina (formerly the Hartford Whalers), Colorado (formerly the Quebec Nordiques), Edmonton, and Phoenix (formerly the Winnipeg Jets) missed the playoffs in the same year. The New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers missed the playoffs this year, marking the first time this happened since the Devils relocated in 1982.\nFor the first time since 1945, the four semifinalists were the previous four Stanley Cup champions: Pittsburgh (2009), Chicago (2010), Boston (2011), and Los Angeles (2012). In fact, Detroit, the 2008 Stanley Cup champions, were the last team to be eliminated in the conference semifinals, so the last five teams remaining were the previous \"five\" champions. The 2013 Stanley Cup Finals were contested between Blackhawks and Bruins, the first meeting in the Final between the two teams, and the first time that two Original Six teams competed in the Final since Montreal defeated the New York Rangers in the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals. It is also the most recent Cup Final to feature two Original Six teams.\nThe Blackhawks also became the first Presidents' Trophy winners to win the Stanley Cup since the Red Wings in 2008. They are the most recent NHL team to accomplish this feat.\nThese playoffs featured 27 overtime games, the most since 1993 and the second-most in NHL history.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe top eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The top three seeds in each conference were awarded to the division winners; while the five remaining spots were awarded to the highest finishers in their respective conferences.\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (8) New York Islanders.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference regular season champions, earning 72 points. The New York Islanders earned 55 points during the regular season to finish eighth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the fourth playoff meeting for these two teams, with the Islanders having won all three of the previous playoff series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1993 Patrick Division finals, where New York upset first place Pittsburgh in seven games. The Penguins won four of the five games in the regular season series.\nThe Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games. Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury stopped all 26 New York shots in a 5–0 shutout in game one. The Islanders then took game two, 4–3, as New York's Colin McDonald, Matt Martin, and Kyle Okposo scored three unanswered goals in the second and third periods. In game three, Chris Kunitz scored the winning goal on a power play at 08:44 of overtime to give Pittsburgh a 5–4 victory. New York evened the series with a 6–4 win in game four, with Mark Streit, John Tavares, and Casey Cizikas scoring three unanswered goals in the third period. Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma then replaced Fleury with Tomas Vokoun as starting goalie for game five, who stopped all 31 shots to lead Pittsburgh to a 4–0 win. In the sixth game, the Islanders put up three leads only to have the Penguins tie it up three consecutive times. Brooks Orpik scored at 07:49 of overtime to give Pittsburgh a 4–3 victory and their fourth and final win of the series.\n(2) Montreal Canadiens vs. (7) Ottawa Senators.\nThe Montreal Canadiens entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference by winning the Northeast Division with 63 points. The Ottawa Senators earned 56 points during the regular season, losing the tiebreaker to the New York Rangers in regulation + overtime wins (22 to 21) to finish seventh overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the first playoff series between these two teams, and the first playoff series between teams from Montreal and Ottawa since 1928, when the Montreal Maroons defeated the original Ottawa Senators in the Canadian Division Quarterfinals. The two teams split their four-game regular season series.\nThe Senators defeated the Canadiens in five games. Midway through the second period of game one, Senators defenceman Eric Gryba was given a five-minute major penalty, a game misconduct, and later a two-game suspension after delivering a hit on Montreal's Lars Eller that sent the Canadiens' centre to the hospital. Despite Gryba's ejection, the Senators won the game, 4–2, with goalie Craig Anderson stopping 48 out of 50 Montreal shots on goal. The Canadiens took game two, 3–1, led by goalie Carey Price's 29 saves. Emotions between the two division rivals boiled over in game three as the teams combined for 236 penalty minutes, but Ottawa centre Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored a hat trick, leading the Senators to a 6–1 victory. The Canadiens then jumped to a 2–0 lead in the second period of game four, but Ottawa scored twice in the final ten minutes of the game. Mika Zibanejad scored a goal off his skate at 11:55 of the third period, cutting the lead to 2–1, with the goal allowed to stand after a video review determined that he did not kick the puck into the net. Cory Conacher got the tying goal with 22.6 seconds left in regulation, and at intermission Montreal replaced an injured Price with Peter Budaj in goal. Kyle Turris scored the winner at 02:32 of overtime to give Ottawa the 3–2 win. The Senators then eliminated the Canadiens with a 6–1 victory in game five; Montreal was without several players due to injury including Price and captain Brian Gionta.\nOne of the quirkier story lines of the series was the large number of teeth lost by players, highlighted by Anderson losing one in game one, Price losing one in game two, and Pageau after taking a stick to the mouth from Montreal defenceman P. K. Subban while scoring his first ever NHL playoff goal, and first of three in game three.\n(3) Washington Capitals vs. (6) New York Rangers.\nThe Washington Capitals entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference by winning the Southeast Division with 57 points. The New York Rangers earned 56 points during the regular season, winning the tiebreaker over Ottawa in regulation + overtime wins (22 to 21) to finish sixth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the eighth playoff meeting for these two teams, and the fourth in the last five years, with the Capitals having won four of the seven previous series. This was a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference semifinals, which the Rangers won in seven games. New York won two of the three games in the regular season series.\nThe Rangers advanced to the second round after soundly defeating the Capitals in game seven, 5–0. The home team won the first six games before the visiting team won game seven, and it was the first road win in a seventh game in franchise history for the Rangers. Washington scored three unanswered goals in the second period of game one to win, 3–1. In game two, Capitals defenceman Mike Green scored the only goal in the game at 08:00 of overtime. The Rangers then evened the series after recording back-to-back 4–3 victories in games three and four, aided by Derick Brassard's one goal and two assists in the former, and Carl Hagelin's one goal and two assists in the latter. Washington won game five, 2–1 on Mike Ribeiro's goal at 09:24 of overtime, while Brassard's second period goal proved to be the difference in New York's 1–0 win in game six. The Rangers then controlled game seven, winning 5–0, with five different players scoring for New York, and goalie Henrik Lundqvist stopping all 35 Washington shots in his second consecutive shutout.\n(4) Boston Bruins vs. (5) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Boston Bruins entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with 62 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 57 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the fourteenth playoff series between these two teams, with the Maple Leafs having won eight of the previous thirteen series. Their most recent meeting was the 1974 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals, where the Bruins defeated the Maple Leafs in four games. Boston won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Bruins rallied from a 4–1 third period deficit in game seven to defeat the Maple Leafs in overtime, 5–4, and advance to the second round. Boston jumped to a 3–1 lead in the series before Toronto won two straight games to force game seven. David Krejci led Boston to a 4–1 victory in game one with a goal and two assists. Joffrey Lupul then scored two goals to lead the Maple Leafs to a 4–2 victory in game two. The Bruins then took game three, 5–2, aided by goalie Tuukka Rask's 45 saves out of 47 shots. Krejci's goal at 13:06 of overtime then gave Boston the win in game four, 4–3. But the Leafs bounced back in game five with a 2–1 victory, behind James Reimer's 43 saves. Reimer then stopped 29 of 30 shots in Toronto's 2–1 win in game six. In game seven, the Maple Leafs jumped to a 4–1 lead in the third period, aided by two goals by Cody Franson. But the Bruins began their comeback with Nathan Horton's goal at 09:18. Then, after pulling goalie Rask to add an extra attacker, Boston scored twice within the last two minutes of regulation to tie the game, first with Milan Lucic's score at 18:38, and then Patrice Bergeron's goal at 19:09. Bergeron then scored at 06:05 in overtime to give the Bruins the 5–4 win and the series. It was the first game seven in NHL playoff history in which a team trailing by three goals in the third period went on to win the game and, therefore, the series. These circumstances were matched during the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, when the San Jose Sharks overcame a three-goal deficit in the third period of game seven over the Vegas Golden Knights to win the series.\nWestern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (8) Minnesota Wild.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks entered the playoffs as the Western Conference regular season champions and Presidents' Trophy winners, earning 77 points. The Minnesota Wild earned 55 points during the regular season to finish eighth overall in the Western Conference. This was the first playoff meeting for these two teams. Chicago won two of the three games in the regular season series.\nThe Blackhawks defeated the Wild in five games. Bryan Bickell's goal at 16:35 of overtime gave Chicago a 2–1 victory in game one. Then, Michael Frolik and Patrick Sharp each scored two goals in the Blackhawks' 5–2 win in game two. Jason Zucker scored at 02:15 of overtime to give the Wild a 3–2 victory in game three. But the Blackhawks controlled games four and five, with Chicago goalie Corey Crawford making 25 saves in a 3–0 shutout in the former, and winger Marian Hossa leading the Blackhawks with two goals and one assist in a 5–1 win in the latter.\n(2) Anaheim Ducks vs. (7) Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Anaheim Ducks entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference by winning the Pacific Division with 66 points. The Detroit Red Wings earned 56 points during the regular season to finish seventh overall in the Western Conference, extending their streak of consecutive playoff appearances to 22. This was the sixth playoff meeting for these two teams, with the Red Wings having won three of the five previous series. The most recent meeting of these teams was in the 2009 Western Conference semifinals, which Detroit won in seven games. Detroit won two of the three games in the regular season series.\nThe Red Wings defeated the Ducks in game seven of the series, 3–2, to advance to the next round. Four games in the series were decided in overtime. In game one, Teemu Selanne scored a power play goal in the third period, and Francois Beauchemin added an empty netter in the final minute, to give Anaheim a 3–1 win. In game two, the Ducks scored three unanswered goals in the third period to tie the game, 4–4, but Red Wings winger Gustav Nyquist scored at 01:21 of overtime to give Detroit the victory. game three was scoreless in the second period until Detroit forward Justin Abdelkader was given a five-minute major penalty, a game misconduct, and later a two-game suspension after illegally charging Anaheim defenceman Toni Lydman. Although they scored only once in the ensuing five-minute power play, goalie Jonas Hiller stopped all 23 Detroit shots to lead the Ducks to a 4–0 win. The next three games went into overtime, as Damien Brunner scored at 15:10 of the extra session to give the Red Wings a 3–2 victory in game four, Nick Bonino at 01:54 to give the Ducks a 3–2 victory in game five, and Henrik Zetterberg at 01:04 in Detroit's 4–3 win in game six. Zetterberg then led the Red Wings with a goal and an assist, and goalie Jimmy Howard made 31 saves in their 3–2 victory in game seven.\n(3) Vancouver Canucks vs. (6) San Jose Sharks.\nThe Vancouver Canucks entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Western Conference by winning the Northwest Division with 59 points. The San Jose Sharks earned 57 points during the regular season to finish sixth overall in the Western Conference and third in the Pacific Division. This was the second playoff series between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 2011 Western Conference Final, where Vancouver defeated San Jose in five games. San Jose won all three games in the regular season series.\nThe Sharks recorded their first playoff sweep in team history. Led by Logan Couture's second period goal and a third period assist, San Jose scored three unanswered goals in game one to win, 3–1. The Canucks held a 2–1 lead late in the third period of game two off of Ryan Kesler's two goals, but then Patrick Marleau tied the game with 55 seconds left in regulation and Raffi Torres scored at 05:31 into overtime to give the Sharks a 3–2 victory. In game three of the series leading 2–1 to start the third period San Jose's Logan Couture and Patrick Marleau then each scored in a span of nine seconds giving the Sharks a 4–1 lead. The Sharks earned a 5–2 victory. In game four of the series Brent Burns scored to give the Sharks the lead, later Mason Raymond scored on the power play. San Jose took the lead again in the dying minutes of the first with a power play tally from Joe Pavelski to make it 2–1. In the third period the Vancouver Canucks rallied back to tie the game and gain the lead from the strengths of Alex Burrows and Alexander Edler goals to make it 3–2. In the last minutes of the third Joe Pavelski tallied the game tying goal as regulation ended 3–3. Patrick Marleau then scored the series winning goal at 13:18 of overtime in San Jose's 4–3 victory in game four.\n(4) St. Louis Blues vs. (5) Los Angeles Kings.\nThe St. Louis Blues entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Western Conference with 60 points. The Los Angeles Kings, entering as the defending Stanley Cup champions, earned 59 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Western Conference. This was the fourth playoff series between these two teams, with St. Louis having won two of the three previous series. The most recent meeting was the previous year's Western Conference semifinals, in which the Kings swept the Blues out of the playoffs. Los Angeles won all three games in the regular season series.\nThe Kings overcame a 2–0 deficit to defeat the Blues in six games. All six games in the series were decided by only one goal. In game one, St. Louis had a 1–0 lead late in the third period before Los Angeles winger Justin Williams tied the game with 31.6 seconds left in regulation. In overtime, Blues defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk was given a four-minute penalty for high-sticking, but on the ensuing power play Kings goalie Jonathan Quick misplayed the puck behind his own net and St. Louis winger Alexander Steen wrapped it into the net for the game-winning shorthanded goal. The Blues also won game two by the same score of 2–1, as defenceman Barret Jackman scored the winning goal with 50.4 seconds remaining in the third period. The Kings then began their four-game winning streak in the series, first with a 1–0 victory in game three, as Quick stopped all 30 Blues shots on goal, and Slava Voynov providing Los Angeles' lone score. Williams and Anze Kopitar then scored 76 seconds apart in the third period of game four to help give Los Angeles a 4–3 victory. In game five, Blues defenceman Alex Pietrangelo tied the game with 44.1 seconds remaining in regulation, but Voynov scored at 08:00 of overtime and the Kings won, 3–2. Los Angeles then closed out the series with a 2–1 victory in game six, as forward Dustin Penner scored the winning goal with 0.2 seconds left in the second period.\nConference semifinals.\nEastern Conference semifinals.\n(1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (7) Ottawa Senators.\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting for these two teams, all occurring over the last seven seasons, with Pittsburgh winning the previous two.

But, Pittsburgh came back with a 7–3 victory in game four, with Kris Letang recording four assists. James Neal recorded his first career playoff hat trick in Pittsburgh's 6–2 win in game five to close out the series and help the Penguins advance to the conference finals.\n(4) Boston Bruins vs. (6) New York Rangers.\nThis was the tenth playoff series between the teams, with Boston having won six of the nine previous series.

In the third period of game six, the Blackhawks scored three straight goals from three different players, including one on a penalty shot by Michael Frolik, to overcome a one-goal deficit and eventually win 4–3. Brent Seabrook scored at 03:35 of overtime to give Chicago a 2–1 victory in game seven to advance to the conference finals. This was the Red Wings' last game as a Western Conference team, as they moved to the Eastern Conference the following season.\n(5) Los Angeles Kings vs. (6) San Jose Sharks.\nThis was the second playoff series meeting for these two teams. Their first meeting was in the 2011 Western Conference quarterfinals, which San Jose won in six games. The two teams split their four-game regular season series.\nIn a series where the home team won all games, the Kings outlasted the Sharks in game seven at the Staples Center to advance to the conference finals. Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick stopped all 35 San Jose shots in a 2–0 home victory in game one. In game two, the Kings' Dustin Brown and Trevor Lewis scored power play goals in 22 seconds apart with less than 2 minutes left in regulation, overcoming a one-goal deficit to win, 4–3. With the series moving to HP Pavilion, Logan Couture's goal at 01:29 of overtime gave the Sharks a 2–1 victory in game three. San Jose then evened the series in game four with another 2–1 victory after building a 2–0 second period lead. In game five back at the Staples Center, the Kings limited the Sharks to 24 shots on goal and Quick recorded his second shutout in the series in a 3–0 win for Los Angeles. The series then ended with two consecutive 2–1 games: Joe Thornton and T.J. Galiardi scored for San Jose in game six at HP Pavilion, and Justin Williams scored both Los Angeles goals in game seven at the Staples Center.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(1) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (4) Boston Bruins.\nThis was the fifth playoff series for these two teams, with each team having won two of the four previous meetings. This was also the third time that they met in a Wales/Eastern Conference Final, having met at this stage in their two previous playoff meetings; in 1991 the Penguins lost the first two games to the Bruins but went on to win the next four, and the next year (1992) they swept the Bruins out of the playoffs; the Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup in both years. The Pittsburgh Penguins made it to their third Conference finals since 2008, while the Boston Bruins were making their second appearance in three years. The Penguins won all three games in the regular season series, all three games by one goal.\nThe Bruins swept the top seeded Penguins, as Boston goalie Tuukka Rask recorded his first two career playoff shutouts, and only allowed two Pittsburgh goals throughout the sweep. Penguins forwards Evgeni Malkin, Sidney Crosby, Jarome Iginla, Pascal Dupuis and James Neal had scored between them 28 goals and 64 points during the first two rounds, but against the Bruins they were outscored 12–2 with Dupuis recording a single assist. The Penguins had scored 13 power-play goals in the first 11 games, but went 0-for 15 on the powerplay in the Conference Final. David Krejci had two goals in the Bruins' 3–0 game one victory. In game two, the Bruins recorded six goals and Rask limited the Penguins to only one goal. Patrice Bergeron then scored at 15:19 of the second overtime period of game three to give Boston a 2–1 win. Finally in game four, Adam McQuaid scored at 05:01 of the third period, the only goal in the game, to give the Bruins a 1–0 win and a trip to the Cup Finals. This marked the first time since 1979 that the Penguins were swept in a playoff series; the Bruins also swept the Penguins out of that year's playoffs. During the 2012–13 season trade deadline, the Bruins were close to acquiring Iginla from the Calgary Flames, but he chose the Penguins instead; Milan Lucic said after the series that Iginla's spurning of Boston ignited the sweep of Pittsburgh, suggesting \"When a guy chooses another team over your team, it does light a little bit of a fire underneath you.\"\nWestern Conference final.\n(1) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (5) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the second playoff series for these two teams. Their only previous meeting was in the 1974 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals, which Chicago won in five games. The Blackhawks won two of the three games in the regular season series. The Chicago Blackhawks made it to their third Conference finals since 2009, while the Los Angeles Kings were making their second straight appearance.\nThe Blackhawks defeated the Kings in five games by extending Los Angeles' road playoff losing streak to six, and they gave the Kings their first home playoff loss in game four. Patrick Sharp and Marian Hossa scored back-to-back goals in their 2–1 victory in game one, Four different Chicago players scored unanswered goals in their 4–2 win in game two, forcing Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick to be replaced by backup Jonathan Bernier midway through the second period. Quick then made 19 out of 20 saves, and Justin Williams and Slava Voynov scored Los Angeles' two unanswered goals, in the Kings' 3–1 win in game three. But in game four, Chicago's Marian Hossa scored the game-winning goal 70 seconds into the third period to give the Blackhawks a 3–2 win. Patrick Kane then recorded a hat trick, including the game-winning goal at 11:40 of double overtime, to give Chicago a 4–3 victory in game five and advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with Boston winning five of the six previous series. They last met in the 1978 Stanley Cup Quarterfinals, where Boston won in a four-game sweep. The teams did not meet in the regular season because of the intra-conference restriction for the season because of the lockout. This was Boston's nineteenth Finals appearance. They last advanced to the Finals in where they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in seven games. This was Chicago's twelfth Finals appearance. They last advanced to the Finals in , where they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. This was the first Stanley Cup Finals to feature two Original Six teams since .\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.

As part of the deal, local coverage from regional sports networks could co-exist with national broadcasts by NBC and associated channels NBC Sports Network, CNBC and NHL Network during the first round. The NBC Sports Group's family of channels gained exclusive rights to the conference semifinals and beyond.\nNational Canadian English-language coverage is split between CBC and the TSN family of networks, including TSN2. French-language telecasts are broadcast on RDS and RDS2.\nFor the first time since they started broadcasting Stanley Cup playoff games in 2006, NBC televised Saturday primetime contests in the second and third rounds instead of in the afternoon. The delayed start of the playoffs caused afternoon conflicts with NBC's coverage of the French Open, among other events in late May."

        "text": "The 2013 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) season, and the conclusion of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Western Conference playoff champion Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Eastern Conference playoff champion Boston Bruins in six games to win their fifth Stanley Cup in team history. The Blackhawks also became just the eighth team to win both the Cup and the Presidents' Trophy (as the team with the best regular season record) in the same season. Chicago's Patrick Kane was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.\nDue to a lockout that both shortened and delayed the start of the regular season, the 2013 Cup Finals began on June 12, and lasted until June 24–tying the lockout impacted for the latest in June that the Stanley Cup was awarded. This was the first Stanley Cup Finals series between two Original Six teams since , and the seventh since its first expansion in 1967. It also marked the first time these two teams have met in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nIn game six of the finals, trailing the Boston Bruins 2–1 with 76 seconds left in the third period, the Blackhawks scored two goals in 17 seconds to win the series 4–2. The win was the Blackhawks' second in four years, after also claiming the title in . It was the first Finals series since 2004 to be tied after two games. It was also the first Stanley Cup Finals since to feature three overtime games, including the fifth longest game in Finals history. This series is the last time to date that a Presidents' Trophy winner has won the Stanley Cup.\nPaths to the Finals.\nBoston Bruins.\nThis was the Boston Bruins's nineteenth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, a couple years removed from , when they also faced the Presidents' Trophy winners, the Vancouver Canucks whom they defeated to win their sixth Cup championship.\nThe Bruins entered the season without the services of goalie Tim Thomas, the Conn Smythe Trophy winner during Boston's 2011 championship. It was announced on June 3, 2012, that he planned on taking a year off from hockey. Thomas was eventually traded to the New York Islanders on February 7, 2013. Tuukka Rask succeeded Thomas as the Bruins' starting goalie. Another of the Bruins' major trades was sending Benoit Pouliot to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Then on April 2, 2013, with about a month left in the lockout-shortened regular season, Boston acquired veteran Jaromir Jagr from the Dallas Stars.\nBoston finished the lockout-shortened regular season with 62 points, finishing in second place in the Northeast Division, and the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. Throughout the regular season, the Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens were neck-and-neck in the division, but the Bruins lost their last game to the Ottawa Senators, a contest that was postponed until the end of the regular season due to the Boston Marathon bombing. In the first round of the playoffs, Boston rallied from a 4–1 third period deficit in game seven to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs in overtime. The Bruins then eliminated the New York Rangers in five games, and then swept the top seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the Conference Finals.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nThis was the Chicago Blackhawks' twelfth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. The Blackhawks sought their fifth Cup championship overall and their first since . In both 2011 and 2012, the Blackhawks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.\nThe Blackhawks began the lockout-shortened regular season by setting the NHL record for most games to start a season without a regulation loss (24), recording their first regulation loss in their 25th game of the season: a 6–2 defeat to the Colorado Avalanche. The Blackhawks finished the regular season with an NHL-best 77 points, winning their second Presidents' Trophy in team history. In the first round of the playoffs, the Blackhawks defeated the Minnesota Wild in five games. In the next round, Chicago came back from a 3–1 game deficit to defeat the Detroit Red Wings in overtime of game seven. In the Conference Finals, the Blackhawks defeated the defending 2012 Cup champion Los Angeles Kings in five games.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nThe Blackhawks rallied from a 3–1 third period deficit in game one to defeat the Bruins in triple-overtime, 4–3. This was the 24th longest NHL overtime game, and the fifth longest in the history of the Stanley Cup Finals. Milan Lucic scored at 13:11 of the first period and 51 seconds into the second period to give the Bruins a 2–0 lead. At 3:08 of the second period, Chicago rookie Brandon Saad scored his first career playoff goal, ending Boston goalie Tuukka Rask's shutout streak of 149:36, and cutting Boston's lead to 2–1. Chicago then had a 5-on-3 for 1:17 midway through the second period, but could not get a shot on goal. The Bruins then increased their lead to 3–1 when Patrice Bergeron scored a power-play goal at 06:09 of the third period. But Dave Bolland and Johnny Oduya scored in 4:14 apart to tie the game. In the overtime periods, the Blackhawks were penalized twice for too many men on the ice, but Boston was unable to score on those two ensuing power-plays. The game finally ended at 12:08 of the third overtime period when Michal Rozsival's shot from the point deflected off of Bolland, then Andrew Shaw, and past Rask into the Boston net.\nGame two.\nThe Bruins tied the series with a 2–1 overtime victory in game two. This was the third consecutive overtime game for the Blackhawks (dating back to the conference finals), and the second consecutive Cup Finals in which the first two games went into overtime. In the first period, Chicago had 19 shots on goal compared to Boston's 4, but only scored on Patrick Sharp's goal at 11:22. Seventy seconds later, a goal by the Blackhawks' Marian Hossa was disallowed after officials blew the play dead prior to the puck crossing the Bruins' goal line. Boston's Chris Kelly then scored his first goal of the playoffs at 14:58 of the second period to tie the game. After a scoreless third period, Daniel Paille won the game for the Bruins at 13:48 of overtime; the Blackhawks' Brent Seabrook sent the puck around the end boards in the Chicago zone, but Brandon Bollig could not push it out to centre ice, allowing Adam McQuaid to steal the loose puck and feed it to Tyler Seguin, who then passed it to Paille.\nGame three.\nBoston goalie Tuukka Rask stopped all 28 Chicago shots in the Bruins' 2–0 victory in game three. Daniel Paille scored Boston's first goal at 02:13 of the second period. Patrice Bergeron then scored a power play goal at 14:05 of the second period, just seconds after the Bruins' 5-on-3 advantage expired. The Blackhawks' Marian Hossa was scratched from the game; Chicago head coach Joel Quenneville later said after the game that Hossa did not play due to an upper-body injury.\nGame four.\n After only 12 total goals were scored in the first three games, game four featured a series high 11 total goals. In the first period, Chicago's Michal Handzus scored a short-handed goal at 06:48 before Boston's Rich Peverley tied the game on a power play goal at 14:43. Five total goals were then scored in the second period. Jonathan Toews deflected Michal Rozsival's shot into the Boston net at 6:48 to give the Blackhawks a 2–1 lead. Chicago then scored again at 8:41: Bryan Bickell's shot was stopped by Tuukka Rask, but Patrick Kane grabbed the rebound from the other side and shot it into the net before the Boston goalie could recover. Milan Lucic cut the lead, 3–2, at 14:43 after shooting a rebound past Chicago goalie Corey Crawford, but Chicago scored right back at 15:32 with Marcus Kruger's goal on a 2-on-1 breakaway. At 17:22, the Bruins scored their second power play goal after Zdeno Chara's shot deflected over the net, hit the glass, then eventually bounced into the crease where Patrice Bergeron tapped it into the net before Crawford could find the puck. In the third period, Bergeron tied the game, 4–4, at 2:05. The Blackhawks then scored their first power play goal of the series with Patrick Sharp's score at 11:19, but Boston answered 55 seconds later with Johnny Boychuk's equalizer. At 09:51 of overtime, Brent Seabrook scored from the point through traffic to give the Blackhawks a 6–5 victory in game four to even the series at 2. All five Bruins goals were shot to the glove side of Crawford, but the Blackhawks never once trailed in this game.\nGame five.\nPatrick Kane scored two goals in the Blackhawks' 3–1 victory in game five. Chicago built a 2–0 lead with Kane's goals at 17:27 of the first period and 05:13 of the second. Boston's Zdeno Chara cut the score to 2–1 at 03:40 of the third period, but Chicago goalie Corey Crawford stopped 24 of 25 Bruins shots, and Dave Bolland added an empty net goal in the waning seconds of the game. Boston's Patrice Bergeron left the game in the second period and was later taken to the hospital for observation, while Chicago's Jonathan Toews suffered an upper body injury and did not play in the third period.\nGame six.\nWith Chicago holding a 3–2 series lead heading into game six, the desperate Bruins outshot the Blackhawks 12–6 in the first period, with the Bruins ending the period up 1–0 due to Chris Kelly's goal. However, Chicago would fight back in the second period, as Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews scored on a breakaway while shorthanded to tie the game (Toews' goal would be recorded as an even strength goal, as it entered the net just after Andrew Shaw's penalty expired). The teams entered the third period with the game tied 1–1. However, Milan Lucic would score at 12:11 of the third period to put the Bruins in front again. With the Bruins clinging onto a 2–1 lead late in the third period, the Blackhawks pulled goalie Corey Crawford for the extra attacker. This resulted in Bryan Bickell scoring the game-tying goal with 76 seconds remaining in the game on a feed from Jonathan Toews. Thus, with the score tied 2–2, it appeared the Finals would go to overtime for the fourth time. However, only 17 seconds after Bickell's goal, Dave Bolland scored what proved to be the series-winning goal, as the Bruins were unable to get an equalizer in the final minute with goalie Tuukka Rask on the bench. Bolland's goal at 19:01 of the third period broke the record for the latest Stanley Cup game-winner scored in regulation.\nOfficials.\nReferees: Wes McCauley (Canada), Dan O'Halloran (Canada), Chris Rooney (United States), Brad Watson (Canada)\nLinesmen: Shane Heyer (Canada), Brian Murphy (United States), Pierre Racicot (Canada), Jay Sharrers (Canada)\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on CBC and in French on the cable network RDS.

        "title": "Matt Scott (American football)",
        "text": "Matt Scott (born September 20, 1990) is a former American football quarterback. Scott was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013.\nHigh school career.\nScott attended Centennial high school in Corona, California. His senior year, he led his football team to a 9–1 regular season record, his only loss came to Mater Dei who was led by quarterback Matt Barkley. Scott then led his team to the state championship game where they lost 31–37 to De La Salle. Before his senior season began Scott committed to Arizona. He chose Arizona over Minnesota and various other programs. He was rated a four star prospect by Rivals.com and the fifth ranked dual threat quarterback in the country. He is the youngest of four boys, three of which played quarterback at his high school, Centennial.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman season Scott was the backup to senior Willie Tuitama and was used mostly as a change of pace quarterback who could run the ball. In this role Scott gained 188 yards rushing averaging 8 yards per carry and scoring two touchdowns. In his limited opportunities to pass he completed 7 of his 11 attempts for 84 yards and 1 touchdown.\nScott was the starting quarterback entering the 2009 season. He got the Wildcats off to a 2–0 start in the 2009 season, however in the third game of the season against Iowa he was pulled in favor of backup Nick Foles. Scott played poorly against Iowa completing only four passes and throwing an interception for a total of 50 yards. Scott played sparingly the rest of the year. He saw some action in a blowout win against Washington State, a blowout bowl loss to Nebraska, and was used as a change of pace quarterback to run in other games. Foles however had established himself as the starting quarterback and the best option to run offensive coordinator Sonny Dykes' pass heavy offense.\nEntering the 2010 season Scott was the backup quarterback to Foles following Foles' superior play after Scott's benching the previous season. In the summer before the 2010 season Scott said that he \"can't stand sitting on the bench\" and that he had \"never been a bench warmer since Pop Warner.\" He also said that he was open to a possible position switch to wide receiver so that he could play. Scott got to play in the first two games of the season after Arizona had gained a sizable lead against their opponents Toledo and Citadel. After the first two games Scott did not see any action again until the Washington State game. Foles left the game with an injury that would turn out to be a dislocated knee. Scott came in and was able to fend off Washington State and secure a win. Scott would start the next two games while Foles recovered from his injury. In the two games Scott started in Foles' absence Arizona won both times beating Washington by thirty points and going to UCLA to win there. Foles came back for the next game against Stanford and Scott was relegated back to his backup role. The Wildcats concluded the season on a 5-game losing streak finishing 7–6.\nDuring the 2011 season Scott redshirted while Foles would start every game. Foles played close to every snap and a backup quarterback was rarely used. By redshirting Scott got the opportunity to come back for a fifth season and have the possibility of starting, rather than running out of eligibility as a backup quarterback.\nRich Rodriguez was hired to be the new head coach of the Wildcats for the 2012 season. This was seen as a positive for Scott who many saw as a perfect fit for Rodriguez's spread option offense because of his speed and mobility. Scott flourished with Rodriguez as head coach. He passed for more than 3,000 yards and threw 21 touchdowns. Following an upset of Oklahoma State Arizona entered the top 25 rankings. They completed another big upset when they beat preseason favorite USC in Tucson. Scott played this game on his parents 27th anniversary and dedicated the win to them. He stated that his parents were at every game he played in and was thankful to have the family support he had during this crazy ride in Arizona. Scott's greatest statistical performance of the season came in defeat however. Against Stanford he set school and Pac-12 records for attempts and completions and passed for 491 yards against Stanford. The 491 yards is third in school history. He finished his career with a win against Nevada in the New Mexico Bowl. He engineered a 17-point fourth quarter comeback in the game, throwing for three touchdowns in the final quarter to help Arizona win 49–48.\nProfessional career.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nFollowing the 2013 NFL Draft, Scott was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was released on August 30, 2013, and signed to the team's practice squad on September 1. He was signed to the active roster at the conclusion of the 2013 regular season.\nScott was released on May 15, 2014.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nHe was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals the next day. The Bengals waived Scott on August 26, 2014.\nEdmonton Eskimos.\nScott was signed to the practice roster of the Edmonton Eskimos on October 7, 2014. He dressed for the team's final regular season game. He was released by the Eskimos on April 27, 2015."

Real Madrid, who eliminated the title holders, Bayern Munich, in the semi-finals, won in extra time, giving them a record-extending 10th title in the competition. Real equalized late in the second half through Sergio Ramos and then pulled away during extra time to win 4–1.\nFor the first time, the clubs who qualified for the group stage also qualified for the newly formed 2013–14 UEFA Youth League, a competition available to players aged 19 or under.\nAssociation team allocation.\nA total of 76 teams from 52 of the 54 UEFA member associations participated in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein, which do not organise a domestic league, and Gibraltar, which started participating in the 2014–15 season after being admitted as a UEFA member in May 2013).

However, this additional entry was not necessary for this season since the title holders qualified for the tournament through their domestic league.\nAssociation ranking.\nFor the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2012 UEFA country coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2007–08 to 2011–12.\nDistribution.\nSince the title holders (Bayern Munich) qualified for the Champions League group stage through their domestic league, the group stage spot reserved for the title holders is vacated, and the following changes to the default allocation system are made:\nTeams.\nLeague positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Title holders).\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows (all draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2013 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties.

        "text": "John J. \"Sonny\" Mahon (August 1851 – June 19, 1928) was an American politician and professional baseball executive. He served as president and principal owner of the Baltimore Orioles of the American League in 1902. He was also a notable political boss in Baltimore, affiliated with the Democratic Party.\nBiography.\nMahon was born in Baltimore in 1851; his parents had emigrated to the United States from Ireland. He became a political boss associated with the Democratic Party, serving 14 years as a member of the Baltimore City Council. He was considered a Democratic political leader of Baltimore during his career.\nMahon succeeded Sydney Frank as team president of the American League's (AL) Baltimore Orioles in 1902. The franchise would later relocate to New York City, becoming the New York Highlanders, and have been known as the New York Yankees since 1913.\nBaltimore's owners felt that AL president Ban Johnson was hurting the team's fortunes. When John McGraw left the Orioles for the New York Giants of the National League (NL), Mahon and his co-owners supported McGraw. In the meantime, Mahon purchased McGraw's shares in the Orioles.\nWith the team in financial straits, reportedly owing $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms), Mahon purchased shares in the team from players John McGraw, Joe Kelley, and Wilbert Robinson, becoming principal shareholder of the Orioles. Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17. In the day they owned the franchise, Freedman released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts so that they could be signed by National League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGraw, Joe McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants. Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players.\nPersonal life.\nMahon was the father-in-law of Joe Kelley, a major league outfielder between 1891 and 1908. Mahon died in his home city in 1928, having been married twice, and was survived by several children."

This was confirmed by the provisionally selected crew winning the Junior Eights at the National Rowing Championships of Great Britain.\nAs an experiment in 1976 it was decided to create for the first time an eight composed of different clubs and schools to compete against the provisionally selected eight Emanuel School at the National Championships. This new crew was referred to as the \"composite eight\".\nIn order to select the eight, coxless pairs time trials were held at Molesey and the fastest five pairs were taken to select the final eight members of the crew based on technique. There were two weeks available for preparation.\nAt the National Championships Emanuel School won, but by an unconvincing margin for an established crew against a crew that had not raced before. The selectors decided on a second race.\nThe composite eight won the second race. The selectors decided that a third race should take place the following day. It was claimed that the headwind benefited the newer composite eight crew who were heavier. Therefore, the third race of 1,500 metres was rowed at Holme Pierrepont, Nottingham in the opposite direction in a tailwind. It was possible to race the course \"backwards\" as the National Championships had finished the day before. The composite eight again won, this time by 1/3 length.\nThe first Junior composite eight raced at Villach, Austria, 1976. After this year all GB Junior eights were composites of schools and clubs. After 1982 all GB Junior crews were composite and selected as result of extensive national junior squad trials, overseen by an ARA appointed International chief Junior Coach .\nOrigins of the Concept.\nThe concept of the junior composite system was taken from a conversation with a German rowing coach in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1975."

The Huskies split their home games between the XL Center in Hartford, Connecticut, and the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion on the UConn campus in Storrs, Connecticut. The Huskies are a member of the Big East Conference. This season marked the first for new head coach Kevin Ollie, a former Husky, who replaced Jim Calhoun, who retired in September 2012 after 26 seasons as head coach.\nPrevious season.\nThe Huskies finished the 2011–12 season 20-14 overall, including 8–10 in Big East play. The Huskies, reigning champions of the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament were eliminated in the first round of the 2012 tournament by a number-8-seeded Iowa State.\nPreseason developments.\nAfter the 2011–12 season, the Huskies were barred from postseason play for 2012–13 due to several years of poor Academic Progress Rate (APR) scores. They had already lost two scholarships for the 2011–12 season due to APR sanctions. As a result of the postseason ban, rising senior forward Alex Oriakhi announced he would transfer to Missouri for his final season of eligibility. Under NCAA rules, he can play immediately at Missouri because Connecticut's postseason ban covers his entire remaining eligibility.\nTwo other players transferred. Redshirt freshman Michael Bradley initially planned to transfer to Western Kentucky, but was denied immediate eligibility by the NCAA, and chose instead to transfer to Vincennes, an Indiana junior college. Rising junior Roscoe Smith was released from his scholarship and ultimately transferred to UNLV.\nRegular season.\nThe Huskies traveled to St. Thomas for the Paradise Jam tournament in mid-November. UConn faced Wake Forest in the first round and won 77–71. The second game matched the Huskies against in-state Quinnipiac, coached by Tom Moore, who spent 13 years as a member of the UConn coaching staff. UConn found itself in a ten-point deficit with under five minutes to go, and managed to tie the score by the end of regulation. The game went to two overtimes before UConn prevailed 89–83.\nIn the Championship game, UConn came from nine points down to take a brief two-point lead with just over two minutes to go, but gave up nine straight points, and ended up with the loss 66–60. The Lobos hit all 21 of their free throw attempts in the game, leaving UConn in the runner-up position.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular Season"

        "text": "David Simon (born August 9, 1982) is an American professional basketball player. He played his collegiate basketball for IPFW.\nCollege career.\nIn his first year as a college player, he averaged 10.6 points per game and 5.8 rebounds. At the end of the year he injured his left knee and went for surgery, but fully recovered for the next season. Before the second season at IPFW, he was ranked as the nation's second-best college center, behind Emeka Okafor of Connecticut. He was named \"Pre-Season Independent Player of the Year\". Simon was also an All-American Candidate. He declared for the 2004 NBA draft without agent, but tore the ACL on his right knee during the Chicago Pre-Draft Camp and withdrew his name from the early entries into the draft and returned to school. He finished his last college season averaging 16.6 points and 6.9 rebounds.\nProfessional career.\nSimon played for the Timberwolves at the NBA Summer League and at the New Jersey Nets mini camp. On 10 October 2005, Simon signed with Bulgarian club Lukoil Academic which participated in the ULEB Cup. In the mid of the season he said\nI needed game like this one, to play well and show I can do well. After the end of ULEB Cup I would like to stay here and hopefully everything will be ok. For now I want to concentrate and play well in ULEB and Bulgarian championship as well.\nIn the Bulgarian league he averaged 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, while in the ULEB Cup he averaged 7.6 points and 7.8 rebounds for 25 minutes on the floor. In 2006 he signed for Russian club Standart Samarskiy Region and stayed for one season. Over 14 games in the Russian Super League, he averaged 11.1 points and 6.9 rebounds (7th in the league). However, he left the team midseason to go to France and Standart finished 13th and relegated into lower league.\nHe then played for French teams, both members of LNB Pro A League, Dijon and Strasbourg till 2010. For Dijon he played one game in Eurocup, where he scored 18 points, while for Strasbourg he played in EuroChallenge, the 3rd tier level transnational men's professional club basketball competition in Europe. Over 6 games he averaged 17.8 points and 8.3 rebounds. In 2010, he signed with the Anyang KGC of the Korean Basketball League where he would go on to make his first All-Star team.\nIn August 2011, Simon signed a one-year deal with Radnički Kragujevac. He was named Adriatic League MVP and was the league's top scorer, averaging 19.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game.\nOn 11 June 2012, Simon signed a one-year contract with the Astana, along with Andreas Glyniadakis. In April 2013, he extended his contract for one more season.\nIn 2014 he returned to the Korean Basketball League with Wonju DB Promy, earning his second KBL All Star Bid and leading them to the Finals. The next season he signed with Seoul SK Knights of the KBL, making another All Star game averaging 20.5ppg and 9rpg. On February 19, 2016, Simon was signed by Tropang TNT as the team's new import, replacing the suspended Ivan Johnson where he averaged 24.5ppg and 15.5rpg.\nIn 2016 he signed with Anyang KGC back in the KBL. He led the team with 26.3ppg and 9.6rpg to a regular season championship as well as the 2016-2017 KBL Season Championship title. The next season he would earn another All Star appearance as well as the KBL Scoring title averaging 26.1ppg and 10.8rpg. In April 2018, Simon was released from Anyang shortly after the KBL implemented a rule on foreign players. The KBL allows each team to have two foreign-born players on their rosters with neither taller than 200 centimeters. Simon was two centimeters over the limit. The move was made to combat declining league attendance, however it was met with much criticism which landed him with an interview on ESPN's Outside the Lines. .\nHe went on to play 4 seasons, 2018-2022 in the Japanese B.League for Kyoto Hannaryz, being top 5 in scoring each of his 4 seasons. In July of 2022 he signed with the Goyang Carrot Jumpers back in the KBL. In March of 2023, he signed with Tokyo Z of the Japanese B2 League.\nIn October of 2023, he signed with Shinshu Brave Warriors of the Japanese B.League."

        "text": "Jeff Scott (born November 18, 1953) was the Senior Writer for Major League Baseball Productions from 1988 until the company was dissolved in 2015. He wrote more than 1100 television shows for various networks including Fox, ESPN, MLB Network, YES Network, ABC, NBC, NESN, Spike, FS1, NBC Sports, and A&amp;E. Included amongst those shows is a Cal Ripken-like streak of writing 450 consecutive episodes of This Week in Baseball (TWIB.) In addition, he wrote the scripts for nearly 150 DVDs and home videos including more than 26 Official World Series films. He wrote for and directed on-camera and record sessions with many celebrities, athletes, broadcasters and voiceover talents. His writing earned him 16 New York Emmy Awards, a Boston/New England Emmy Award, 17 National Sports Emmy nominations, a Cine Golden Eagle award, and various other awards and honors some of which date back to his days writing for newspapers. Jeff Scott lives in rural New Jersey with his wife and niece. He is an avid gardener and a devoted Phillies, Eagles, 76ers and Flyers fan.\nEarly career.\nScott’s writing career began in the early 1970s as a part-time sports writer for \"The Intelligencer\", in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. In 1975 he was hired as sports editor and feature writer for the News-Herald in Perkasie – a position he held for the next five years. Following a brief period in which he drove across the country for fun and then worked as a truck driver, deejay and day cook, he landed a job at The Free Press in Quakertown, Pa. There he served as a columnist, medical writer, movie reviewer and editor of a weekly entertainment magazine. In 1981, when Free Press publisher Charles Meredith III underwent quadruple bypass surgery, Scott received permission to observe the operation directly over Meredith’s chest. He then wrote a series of award-winning articles about it for The Free Press and then adapted the series for a feature story that appeared in Philadelphia Magazine in October 1981.\nIn the summer of 1983, producer/director Mike Tollin and Gary Cohen (Halcyon Days Productions) hired him to write \"This is the USFL\", the weekly highlight show for the new United States Football League, which aired on ABC from 1983-1985. Once the USFL disbanded, Scott remained with Halcyon Days Productions for several years as a freelance writer and producer. It was during this time that he and Tollin followed Phillies slugger Mike Schmidt during his quest for 500 home runs and then produced a film that chronicled the slugger’s effort. Scott was also an integral part of various other shows and videos including \"Men of October\", \"Legacy\", \"The Best of the USFL\" and \"Michael Bolton’s Winning Softball\". In the late 1980s, Scott wrote more than 1,000 one-minute radio shows for \"John Madden’s Sports Quiz\", \"John Madden’s Sports Calendar\" and \"Bob Costas’ Sports Flashback\" – before landing a job with MLB Productions writing for baseball television and the VCR/DVD industry.\nMajor League Baseball Productions.\nJeff Scott joined MLB Productions (through Phoenix Communications) in 1988 as the writer for \"ESPN’s Major League Baseball Magazine\" – one of the first independently produced programs for the fledgling network. Over the next four years Scott wrote 176 episodes of the widely acclaimed program which was narrated by Warner Fusselle. He began writing \"This Week in Baseball\" – the longest running sports anthology program in television history – in 1992, for Mel Allen, the legendary announcer and original voice of TWIB. After the Hall of Fame broadcaster died in 1996, Scott wrote for another Hall of Famer, Ozzie Smith, who hosted the show for two seasons. When the Baseball Commissioner’s office took back MLB Productions from Phoenix Communications in 1999 Scott began writing for Buzz Brainard, who would narrate TWIB for the next 11 seasons. Scott wrote 450 consecutive episodes of the iconic show before it was discontinued at the end of the 2011 season. Scott wrote and helped create TWIB’s replacement – \"MLB Player Poll\" – which debuted on FOX and MLB Network in the spring of 2012. The program – which polls players on a variety of subjects – was hosted by MLB Network personality, Greg Amsinger during its two year run. Scott also helped create, and wrote, \"MLB162\" for Fox Sports 1 in 2014.\nScott wrote several other weekly shows, as well as every Official World Series Film from 1988-2014 (with the exception of 1999). The World Series Films were often narrated by a celebrity, whom Scott recorded and directed in the voiceover sessions.\nScott played a significant role in the launching of the YES Network, NBC Sports, MLB Network, and Fox Sports 1 by writing fresh programming to help the networks garner audiences in their formative years. The YES Network, launched in 2002, premiered a new biographical documentary series on the most famous Yankee players called the \"Yankeeography\". Scott wrote more than 50 \"Yankeeography\" episodes, as well as several other features for the YES Network. MLB Network, launched in 2009, featured a new countdown show – Prime 9 – for which Scott wrote all 68 episodes. He also wrote another 30 programs for MLB Network including behind-the-scenes reality series about both the Phillies (\"The Pen\") and the White Sox (\"The Club\".) He was also the senior writer for the \"Caught Looking\" series on NBC Sports during its debut season and \"Mission October\" on FS1 in 2013 and 2014.\nVoices.\nThe following is a list of some of the men and women whom Scott has written for and directed in recording sessions:"

A right-arm off break bowler, Harbhajan Singh has taken 417 wickets in Test, 269 wickets in One Day International (ODI) and 25 wickets in Twenty20 International (T20I) matches for India. He has the second-highest number of five-wicket hauls (28) in international cricketnext to Anil Kumbleamong Indian cricketers and the eleventh among overall.\nHarbhajan made his Test debut against Australia in 1998. His first five-wicket haul came against the same team during the second Test of the 2000–01 series at Eden Gardens. His six wickets for 73 runs in the second innings of the match raised his tally to thirteen wickets in the match; his performance was instrumental in India winning the match after being forced to follow-on. In the third Test of the series, he claimed fifteen wickets for 217 runs, including career-best figures of eight wickets for 84 runs. The majority of his five-wicket hauls in Test cricketseven out of his twenty-fivehave come against Australia.\nHarbhajan's first five-wicket haul in ODIs came against England in 2002, four years after he made his debut. He took five wickets for 43 runs in the match which India lost. His best figures of five wickets for 31 runs came against the same team in 2006. Although Harbhajan made his first T20I appearance in 2006, he has yet to take a five-wicket haul in the format . His figures of four wickets for 12 runs against England in 2012 remain his best in T20Is."

The Nationals rallied in the second half to win, 21–19, before 900 fans.\nThe 1898–99 season saw six teams in the league. Three were in Philadelphia (Clover Wheelmen, Germantown Nationals, and Hancock Athletic Association), and three were in New Jersey (Millville Glass Blowers, Camden Electrics, and Trenton Nationals). Two of the Philadelphia teams folded before New Year's Eve 1898, but the other four completed the season, with the Trenton Nationals winning the first championship with an 18–2–1 record.\nThe following season was more stable for the new league. The season was divided into two halves. Teams in the first half were Trenton, New York Wanderers, Camden Electrics, Pennsylvania Bicycle Club, Bristol Pile Drivers, and Chester, PA. \nThe New York Wanderers joined, and only one team, out of Chester, Pennsylvania, dropped out, and it was immediately replaced by the Millville team, which had originally elected not to participate that season. Trenton and Millville provided the best teams in the loop, with Trenton gaining a disputed championship, in which the team won both halves of the season.\nLeague expands schedule.\nThe National Basketball League began the 1900–01 season with seven teams and an expanded schedule of 32 games. Of the seven teams, six finished the season. Only the newest team, from Burlington NJ, failed to complete the season. The seven teams were the New York Wanderers, Trenton Nationals, Millville Glass Blowers, Bristol Pile Drivers, Camden Skeeters, Pennsylvania Bicycle Club, and Burlington.\nWith five of the seven teams finishing with records of .500 or better, NBL fans saw the good competitive play from most teams throughout the season. In this season the Camden team also went by the handle of Camden Skeeters. With the split season dropped, no playoffs were necessary, and the New York Wanderers captured the League title by three games.\nThe 1901–02 season may have been the most successful year of the National Basketball League in terms of stability, with six strong franchises, namely the Bristol, New York, Trenton, Camden, Millville, and Philadelphia teams from the previous year. The schedule expanded once again to 40 games, every game saves one was played as scheduled, no teams dropped out, and there was only one really weak team in the league. Camden finally became more than a .500 team and lost the league crown to the Bristol Pile Drivers by only 3 games. Bristol had a 28–12 record.\nLeague in decline.\n1902–1903 was the season was again a split season. There were eight first-half teams: Camden Electrics, New York Wanderers, Bristol Pile Drivers, Philadelphia Phillies, Trenton Potters, Conshohocken, and Burlington Shoe Pegs. The second half of the season saw only six teams: Camden Electrics, Burlington Shoe Pegs, Wilmington Peaches, Trenton Potters, New York Wanderers, and Conshohocken. Two teams dropped out before the season finished. The Burlington team was doing so poorly that its owner-coach, Frank Reber, fired his entire team, purchased the Bristol franchise and used Bristol's players to represent Burlington. Phillies manager and future member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, Frank Morgenweck, disbanded his Phillies team to purchase the Wilmington team.\nCamden Electrics, coached by Billy Morgenweck (Frank's brother), cruised to 36 wins against only 9 defeats, a winning percentage of .800. The first half record was 15–2, and the second-half record was 21–7.\nThings did not go very well during the offseason in 1903 in the National Basketball League. Only five teams elected to play that year. More importantly, New York, Burlington, and Wilmington, all with experienced owners and coaches, failed to return. The league began the season with only five teams: Camden Electrics, Trenton Potters, Conshohocken, Millville Glass Blowers, and St. Bridget's Biddies. Trenton dropped out on December 26, 1903, and Camden left on December 31. The National Basketball League was disbanded on January 4, 1904, not without controversy, and at least one lawsuit followed its demise. Billy Morgenweck was subsequently sued by investors in the Camden Electrics.\nChampions.\n1898–1899 Trenton Nationals&lt;br&gt;\n1899–1900 Trenton Nationals&lt;br&gt;\n1900–1901 New York Wanderers&lt;br&gt;\n1901–1902 Bristol Pile Drivers&lt;br&gt;\n1902–1903 Camden Electrics&lt;br&gt;\n1903–1904 Camden Electrics were in first place when the league disbanded."

The AFC Challenge Cup, which reflected the philosophy of \"Vision Asia\", was created for teams to experience playing in a continental competition with the possibility to win an AFC trophy and potentially discover new talent.

        "title": "Monmouth Golf Club",
        "text": "Monmouth Golf Club is an 18-hole golf club based just outside Monmouth at Leasbrook Lane, near Dixton.\nThe course is located on high ground to the east of the town with views of the Welsh hills, the Forest of Dean and the Wye Valley. The club claims to be \"one of the prettiest golf courses in Wales\". The club has a short game practice area and a nine-hole practice putting green. Other facilities include a clubhouse, bar and shop\nThe hole names on the course are:\nHistory.\nMonmouth Golf Club was formed on 25 June 1896 at a meeting held at the Kings Head Hotel, Monmouth.\nThe site of the club was initially Priory Farm. This proved unsuitable for golf and the club moved to Vauxhall Fields, taking over the Vauxhall Golf Club and its course. In 1903 the club moved to the Hendre Estate. The club moved again in 1905 to Troy Farm.\nMembership in the early years was about 30 to 40 people, which was deemed low. The problem of low membership was attributed to the inability of the course to cope with long grass in the summer months. This was because the landlord of the ground, which was rented out as a golf course, wanted to make hay on the fairways as well as receiving rent for the course. A dispute arose regarding the cutting of the long grass by the members of the club which caused the landowner to complain that the club was exceeding the terms of the covenant. A court case followed, eventually leading to a High Court ruling in 1910 which defined a fairway. The ruling was made in the club's favour. The long grass problem led to the closure of the course in 1912. Several attempts were made to reopen but these were not successful until 1920 when the club was reformed at Dixton on part of the present course.\nGeorge Waldron was the club's first professional. In 1921 he laid out a nine-hole course, which opened on 1 October 1921.\nIn 1992, land was rented to enable a further nine holes. The full eighteen-hole course was opened on 18 July 1992 and the new clubhouse later that year.\nImprovements in the drainage of the course and the construction of buggy paths around the course took place in the following years. In 2008 the club purchased the freehold of the previously rented area of the course, making the 18-hole course wholly owned by the members."

The Tigers, led by first year head coach Mitch Henderson, played their home games at Jadwin Gymnasium and are members of the Ivy League. The team captains were seniors Douglas Davis and Patrick Saunders. They finished the season 20–12, 10–4 in Ivy League play to finish in third place. They were invited to the 2012 College Basketball Invitational where they defeated Evansville in the first round before falling in the quarterfinals to Pittsburgh. The season was highlighted by wins over a ranked Harvard team and the Florida State Seminoles. The team was led by unanimous first team All-Ivy League selection Ian Hummer and second team selection Douglas Davis.\nPreview.\nPrinceton entered the season having won the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season championship and having earned the resulting 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament invitation. The team entered the season having lost senior captains Dan Mavraides and Kareem Maddox. Maddox was the reigning Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and a unanimous first team All-Ivy selection. Mavraides had been a second team All-Ivy selection. The team returned second team All-Ivy selection Hummer.\nEntering the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season head coach Mitch Henderson began his tenure at Princeton, taking over for Sydney Johnson. With the move that resulted from Johnson taking a new coaching job, Princeton has six alumni who are active Division I head coaches, a total second only to eight by the North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball program. The Ivy League media poll selected Princeton to be tied with Yale for second place behind Harvard. Princeton had been the preseason favorite the year before.\nSchedule.\nWith a new first-time head coach, the team got off to slow starts. It started the season with a 1–5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference schedule with a 2–3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. The recovery enabled the team to qualify for its 32nd post season appearance (24 NCAA, 5 NIT and 2 CBI).\nPrinceton earned its first home win against a ranked opponent since the 1976–77 team's January 3, 1977, victory over Notre Dame by defeating Harvard (No. 21 Coaches/25 AP) on February 11, 2012. The win was also its first against a ranked opponent on any court since November 11, 1997, which is when the 1997–98 team opened its season with a victory over a ranked Texas team at Meadowlands Arena (now named Izod Center) in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Princeton also defeated eventual 2012 ACC men's basketball tournament champion Florida State five weeks after Harvard did as well as Big East Conference member and New Jersey rival . In addition, the team's schedule included the ACC's NC State. Its results against Harvard, Florida State and NC State give the team a 2–2 record against teams in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.\nFor the 18th consecutive season, the Ivy League men's basketball schedule concluded with a Tuesday Penn–Princeton basketball rivalry game against the 2011–12 Quakers. Princeton's 62–52 victory enabled it to retain slim 26–25 and 24–23 leads in terms of Ivy League Championships and Ivy League team NCAA Tournament appearances, respectively.\nIn the first round of the 2012 CBI Tournament, senior Douglas Davis scored a career-high 31 points to lead Princeton to a 95–86 victory over Evansville. Although Davis posted another 20 points in the subsequent quarterfinal game against Pittsburgh to surpass Kit Mueller for second place on the Princeton scoring list, Princeton lost 82–61 to end the season. Davis' appearance in the March 19 contest also enabled him to surpass Ryan Wittman as the Ivy League's all-time leader in games played (122). Pittsburgh eventually went on to win the tournament.\n!colspan=9| Regular Season\n!colspan=9| 2012 CBI\nAll-Ivy.\nThe following players earned Ivy League postseason recognition:\nOther.\nThe National Association of Basketball Coaches announced their Division I All‐District District 13 team on March 14, recognizing the nation's best men's collegiate basketball student-athletes.

        "text": "The 2012 United States Open Championship was the 112th U.S. Open, played June 14–17 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, California. Webb Simpson won his first major title, one stroke ahead of runners-up Graeme McDowell and Michael Thompson.\nVenue.\nThis was the fifth U.S. Open at the Olympic Club, all played at the Lake Course. In 1955, unheralded Jack Fleck defeated Ben Hogan in an 18-hole playoff. In 1966, Billy Casper staged one of the greatest comebacks in U.S. Open history, erasing a seven-stroke deficit on the final nine holes to tie Arnold Palmer, then prevailed in an 18-hole playoff. In 1987, Scott Simpson won by a stroke over 8-time major winner Tom Watson. In 1998, Lee Janzen won his second U.S. Open, one stroke ahead of Payne Stewart.\nCourse layout.\nOlympic Club - Lake Course\nLengths of the course for previous major championships:\nOne unique aspect of the course was that players began the first and second rounds on the 1st and 9th tees, rather than the 1st and 10th tees, as is typical. This was due to the 8th green and 9th tee being located far closer to the clubhouse than the 10th tee.\nChanges to cuts.\nFor 2012, the USGA changed the rule governing which players would make the cut after 36 holes. Now, only the top 60 players, plus those tied, would make the cut, instead of also including those players within ten strokes of the leader.\nField.\nAbout half the field each year consists of players who are fully exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open. The players who have qualified for the 2012 U.S. Open are listed below. Each player is classified according to the first category in which he qualified, but other categories are shown in parentheses.\nThe qualification categories changed substantially in 2012. Seven categories (9 and 11 to 16, from 2011) were eliminated. These categories exempted top finishers on the money lists of various tours and multiple PGA Tour winners. Three categories were added (3, 4, and 9 below), for the winners of The Amateur Championship, the Mark H. McCormack Medal, and the BMW PGA Championship. Two categories were expanded (13 and 14 below), to include the top 60 instead of the top 50 in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n1. Last 10 U.S. Open Champions\n2. Top two finishers in the 2011 U.S. Amateur\n3. Winner of the 2011 British Amateur\n4. Winner of the 2011 Mark H. McCormack Medal\n5. Last five Masters Champions\n6. Last five British Open Champions\n7. Last five PGA Champions\n8. Last three Players Champions\n9. Winner of the 2012 BMW PGA Championship\n10. The U.S. Senior Open Champion\n11.

He is a member of the Union nationale des joueurs professionnels de tennis (UNJPT), and part of the \"after-tennis\" committee of the DTN (Direction technique nationale) of the Fédération Française De Tennis (FFT).\nVitoux made his Grand Slam debut in the 1990 French Open and was beaten in the opening round by Soviet player Andrei Cherkasov. He made two further French Open appearances and was eliminated in the first round again in each, to Michael Chang and Andrei Medvedev. The Frenchman qualified for the US Open in 1996 and registered his first ever Grand Slam win when he accounted for fellow qualifier Ramón Delgado in the opening round. He was then eliminated in the second round by David Wheaton in four sets.\nIt wasn't until 1994 that he appeared in an ATP Tour event that wasn't a Grand Slam. He made the second round of the 1996 Abierto Mexicano de Tenis tournament in Mexico City."

        "text": "The 2012 IIHF World Championship final was played at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland, on 20 May 2012 between Russia and Slovakia.\nRussia won the gold medal by defeating Slovakia 6–2.\nBackground.\nSlovakia and Russia faced each other in the 2002 Championship final; that game ended 4–3 in favour of the Slovaks, who captured the team's only gold medal in World Championship history.\nThe 2012 final was Slovakia's third final in history, and their first since 2002. Russia made their fourth final appearance in five years. Russia had won twenty-five gold medals (three as Russia) previously.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe first period had only lasted one minute before Slovakia captain Zdeno Chára fired a hard shot from the blue line to open up the score. Russia would then dominate the rest of the period, and at 09:57 Alexander Semin received a pass from Washington Capitals teammate Alexander Ovechkin on a breakaway and tied the game 1–1. Russia continued to pressure the Slovaks' net, but a solid-playing Ján Laco and good defensive play by the Slovaks kept the game even. No penalties were called during the game's first 20 minutes.\nIn the second period, Russia grabbed a three-goal lead. In a tangled situation in front of Slovakia's goaltender, Alexander Perezhogin put the puck in the net and gave Russia their first lead of the game at 26:10. Then at 33:31 Sergei Shirokov passed to assistant captain Alexei Tereshchenko on a two-on-one situation and Tereshchenko scored to give the Russians a 3–1 lead. Less than two minutes later, Pavel Datsyuk stole the puck in the Slovak zone and passed to Alexander Semin who netted his second goal of the game, giving Russia a three-goal lead. Shortly thereafter, at 35:43, Zdeno Chára was given the first penalty of the game, a tripping penalty. The Russians were unsuccessful in converting on the power play. Russia outshot Slovakia 16–8 in the second period.\nAt 43:55 in the third period, Pavel Datsyuk sealed the game for Russia with his first goal of the game. Shortly after this, Slovakia's goaltender Ján Laco was pulled and replaced by Peter Hamerlík. Slovakia was given an opportunity on the power play following a slashing penalty on Alexander Ovechkin at 48:47, Russia's first penalty of the game. It took 50 seconds on the power play before Zdeno Chára scored his second goal of the game on a one-timer in front of the net to cut the deficit to three goals. Evgeni Malkin finished the game off at 58:02 by scoring his eleventh goal of the tournament to make the score 6–2.\nThe game ended 6–2 for Russia, who captured the team's twenty-sixth World Championship gold medal in history (fourth as Russia). Slovakia earned their second World Championship silver medal.\nAfter the game had ended, several Slovak players donned Pavol Demitra jerseys backwards to honor his memory. Demitra had died on September 7, 2011.\nEvgeni Malkin was named the MVP of the tournament."

The boathouse is on the west (here briefly south) bank of the river next to Lendal Bridge and in Memorial Gardens. The club has modern buildings but is three years older than the oldest coastal rowing club in Britain, Dover; it is 25 years younger than the oldest non-academic rowing club, Leander. The reach of canalised river it enjoys is unusually long – over .\nHistory.\nThe present boathouse is a postwar building. Its boat storage is overcrowded owing to the size of the club and the level of activity. A refurbishment plan is underway, and it is hoped to update also the changing facilities, gym and bar/lounge.\nLocation.\nThe clubhouse is next to Lendal Bridge along West Esplanade. It is by the Ouse – over of rowable water; upstream from the boathouse the river is winding, in places quite narrow, and is rowable as far as Linton Lock. This stretch is almost free from recreational and commercial traffic. The public footpath and cycle (towpath) is between the river and boathouse. Wildlife encountered includes herons, kingfishers, otters and at least one seal. Downstream the river is wider with less severe bends, but is less interesting and, especially in summer, is sometimes congested with excursion craft, cabin cruisers and hired motor-boats. Many of the bridges are single-span.\nClub colours.\nThese are white, with a narrow band each of purple, black and gold diagonally.\nEvents.\nThe club runs or assists with five events throughout the year, including 2 heads and 3 regattas.\nHeads.\nThis is raced from a start near the A1237 road bridge to a finish near the club. Landmarks on the course are: Maddies' Landing (a derelict wharf once serving the old mental hospital at Clifton), Clifton Bends and Bridge (a sharp S-bend under a road bridge), St. Peter's School boathouse on stroke-side about 800 m from the finish and finally (with 200 m to go) the Scarborough Bridge carrying a railway across the river.\nStarted in 2015 to provide early season head racing in small boats. The course is 4,500m downstream from Rawcliffe Landing near the bypass bridge to just above Scarborough Railway Bridge in the city centre. Landmarks include Maddies' Landing (a derelict wharf once serving the old mental hospital at Clifton) and Clifton Bends and Bridge (a sharp S-bend under a road bridge).\nA shorter course, upstream from a point at Fulford upstream of the A64 road bridge to a finish at the King's Staithe.
