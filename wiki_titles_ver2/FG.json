All matches will be held at Horton Park.\nThe winner of the tournament, Fiji, qualified directly for the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup, to be played in Bangladesh.

Papua New Guinea defeated Vanuatu in a playoff to gain entry to the 2015 World Cup Qualifier, with the chance to gain the final spot at the World Cup. Two other East Asia-Pacific under-19 sides, Australia and New Zealand, are ICC full members, and thus qualified directly for the World Cup.\nTeams and qualification.\nTeams were unchanged from the 2013 tournament, played on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.\nPreparation.\nFiji, along with Papua New Guinea the only side to have appeared at every EAP Under-19 Trophy, trained at Buckhurst Park, Suva, with Australian Shane Jurgensen serving as the team's coach for the tournament. The PNG under-19s, nicknamed the Garamuts after a type of slit drum, are to be coached by John Ovia, with assistance from New Zealander Dipak Patel, the coach of the country's senior side. PNG will be captained by Lou Toua, the brother of Olympic weightlifter Dika Toua. Samoa is to be coached by Uala Kaisara, a former Samoan national team player, while Vanuatu will be coached by Shane Deitz.\nFixtures.\nThe tournament incorporated a single round-robin, with each team playing the other once.

        "text": "The 2015 Ironman World Championship was a long distance triathlon competition held on October 10, 2015 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and won by Jan Frodeno of Germany and Daniela Ryf of Switzerland. The race was the 39th edition of the Ironman World Championship, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978. The championship was organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) and awarded a total purse prize of $650,000.\nQualification.\nThe division of athletes was divided into professional, age group, physically challenged, and hand cycle divisions.\nFor entry into the 2015 World Championship race professional triathletes qualified for the championship through a point system. Points were earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2015 championship race that period was August 30, 2014 to August 23, 2015. The top 50 male and top 35 female pros in points at the end of the qualifying year qualify to race in Kona. An athlete's five highest scoring races were counted in the point totals. At least one Ironman race must have been completed and only three Ironman 70.3 races count towards an athlete's overall point total. Prior champions of a WTC Championship received an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they competed in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year. Additionally, winners of the five regional Ironman championships received automatic qualification into the 2015 Ironman Championship. All automatic entries awarded did not count toward the number of available qualifying spots. The available prize money to professional triathletes for qualifying races ranges from $25,000 to $150,000, depending on the event.\nAmateur athletes could qualify through a single performance at an Ironman event or at the Ironman 70.3 Kraichgau event. Slots were allocated to each amateur age group category, male and female, with the number of slots given out based on that category's proportional representation of the overall field. Each age group category was tentatively allocated one qualifying spot in each qualifying event. This qualifying year marked a large de-emphasis on using selected Ironman 70.3 series races as an avenue for amateur athletes to qualify for the Ironman World Championships. The change was made to accommodate for the increased number of qualifying slots created from the newly added full Ironman events.\nOther means of entry into the championship race could also be obtained through a random allocation lottery, through Ironman's Legacy program, or through the Ironman's charitable eBay auction. Handcycle competitors could qualify at Ironman Cairns (one male/one female), Ironman 70.3 Luxembourg (one male/one female) and Ironman 70.3 Buffalo Springs Lake (two male/one female)\nIllegal lottery.\nAccording to a sworn complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida, Ironman illegally charged athletes for a chance to win the opportunity to compete in the Ironman World Championship. According to Florida law, the state where the World Triathlon Corporation resides, it is illegal to set up and charge for a lottery. Because WTC charged a $50 fee to enter the lottery, instead of giving away the opportunity to win a slot at the championships, they were in violation of this law. Following the complaint WTC cooperated with the United States Attorneys office and the FBI's investigation of the matter and agreed to forfeit $2,761,910, the amount collected from the lottery since October 24, 2012.\nWinners of the 2015 lottery were notified on March 17, 2015, prior to the announcement of the complaint. WTC stated that these winners would be unaffected by this decision and that their slots for the upcoming championship race would be honored.\nNon-point races.\nPrior to the 2014 Ironman Boulder race, World Triathlon Corporation's CEO, Andrew Messick, announced a redistribution of prize money to help facilitate paying ten professionals deep at each race as well as awarding larger prize purses at select races across Ironman and Ironman 70.3. As part of this initiative, WTC eliminated points and prize purses for professional triathletes at 9 Ironman events and 11 Ironman 70.3 events in 2015, all occurring within North America. Those Ironman races with no points or prize purse offered include: Ironman Boulder, Louisville, Wisconsin, Maryland, Lake Tahoe, Florida, Muskoka, Los Cabos and Lake Placid. The majority of these listed events occur after the qualifying period has ended, August, and near the date of the annual Championship event in October. This would also mark the first time since 1985 that an Ironman race will not offer a prize purse. For the 2015 Ironman Championship qualifying period this affects Ironman Lake Placid and Ironman Boulder.\nQualifying Ironman races.\nXAmateur only competition."

        "title": "WMRA World Cup",
        "text": "The WMRA World Cup is an annual series of mountain running competitions organised by the World Mountain Running Association (WMRA) that runs from around May to October. Athletes are awarded points for each performance on the tour. Its predecessor was the Alpine Grand Prix, a 1997 formation including four European races in the Alps region. It formally became the WMRA Grand Prix in 1999 and subsequently expanded to six races in 2001. It reverted to four races in 2007 and from 2008 onwards began to vary between five and seven races. The competition took its current title World Cup in 2014.\nHistory.\nThe series originally was held mid-year around July to August, fitting mostly between the European Mountain Running Championships (held in early July) and the World Mountain Running Championships (held in mid-September). From 2001 onwards, the expansion of the series meant the inclusion of the World Championships as a leg of the series (if held in Europe) and the Grand Prix Final event coming after the championships as a season-closer for mountain running. The races in the middle period of the series are usually held relatively close together to allow top level athletes from across the world to compete in many races without excessive travel. From 2006 onwards the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) began sanctioning the meetings on the annual circuit.\nThe points scoring format is cumulative. Finishing positions in a WMRA Grand Prix race range from 100 points for first to 1 point for 30th. Additional points may be awarded for performances achieved at the World Championships, if that event is included in the tour that year, and the Grand Prix Final race. An athlete's four best performances across the series are totalled and the athlete with the highest overall score wins the series. The series has a men's division and a women's division, with both a men's and women's series winner being declared. Athletes must compete in at least two races in order to be considered in the final rankings.\nJonathan Wyatt of New Zealand is the most successful athlete of the series history, accumulating eight wins from 1999 to 2009. He is also the only male athlete to achieve a perfect score (winning all his races), having done so five times consecutively from 2002 to 2006. Angela Mudge of Great Britain and Poland's Izabela Zatorska are the joint most successful female runners across the series, each with three victories to their name. Zatorska became the first person to achieve a perfect score in the series in 2001. Anna Pichrtová (2006) and Andrea Mayr (2014) are the only other women to match that feat. Eritrean Azeria Teklay became the first winner from Africa in 2012, marking increased participation from outside the Western world.\nThe World Cup was cancelled in 2020. From 2022 World Cup Gold Label and Silver Label events are held.\nRaces.\nNumerous races have featured over the history of the competition, most of them being held in the Alps. Exceptions to this include the Gibraltar Rock Race in Gibraltar, the Snowdon Race in Wales, Skaala Uphill in Norway, and Alyeska Mountain Run in Alaska – the latter (included once in 2002) is the only occasion that a Grand Prix race has been held outside of Europe. The Šmarna Gora Mountain Race in Slovenia has served the honour of being the Grand Prix Final race on several occasions."

        "title": "List of Derbyshire County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Derbyshire. The club was established on 4 November 1870 and has competed in first-class cricket since 1871, List A cricket since 1963 and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" has diminished since the 1980s. The Derbyshire team have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 home matches at twenty-five different grounds. This includes grounds in Burton upon Trent, Knypersley, Leek, Cheadle and Checkley, all of which are not actually located in Derbyshire, but in the adjoining county of Staffordshire.\nThe county's debut home game in first-class cricket was played at the County Ground in Derby against Lancashire. The venue has also been known as the Racecourse Ground, as it had previously been used for horse racing, and also served as the original home ground of Derby County Football Club, which was formed as an offshoot of the cricket club in 1884. The County Ground has remained the cricket club's primary ground, hosting the majority of home matches, and also played host to the club's first home fixture in Twenty20 cricket against Nottinghamshire in 2003. Queen's Park in Chesterfield, however, staged the club's first home game in List A cricket against Essex in 1964. Queen's Park was first used by the county in 1898 and has continued to be a regular venue for Derbyshire matches, staging over 400 first-class games.\nBetween the Second World War and 2019, the county only used four new venues for first-class matches. In the late 1940s Abbeydale Park in Dore, a suburb of Sheffield, hosted two matches. Dore had been part of Derbyshire until 1934 but due to boundary changes was actually in the county of Yorkshire by the time Derbyshire played there, and the ground has subsequently hosted Yorkshire CCC home matches. Derbyshire played two first-class matches at the Bass Worthington Ground in Burton upon Trent in the 1970s and one at the Town Ground in Heanor in 1987. Several other grounds have been used for matches in the shorter forms of cricket since the 1980s, including Highfield in Leek. In 2020, a number of designated home games were played at the opponents' grounds during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, as the County Ground was being used as an ECB biosecure training camp for the touring Pakistan team.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Derbyshire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Derbyshire CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. The Derbyshire Cricket Board played one List A match at the Town Ground in 2000. The Derbyshire Cricket Board is a separate organisation from Derbyshire County Cricket Club and its matches are not included in the totals.\nC. Minor Counties North played one List A match at Tean Road in 1973. The match was against Derbyshire, but Minor Counties North were officially the home team. Only the List A match played at the ground by Derbyshire in which they were the home team is recorded in the table.\nD. Derbyshire played a number of designated home games at opponents' grounds in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as their home ground was being used for international matches."

        "text": "Taylor Mackenzie Wilson ( Pischke; born April 18, 1993) is a Canadian professional volleyball player. She has won seven Canadian national titles (four indoor volleyball and three beach volleyball), including the women's volleyball championship in 2014.\nPersonal life.\nWilson (then Pischke) was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to Garth Pischke, a two-time Olympian with Canada men's national volleyball team, and a former coach of the Manitoba Bisons men's team, and mother Cindy Shepherd, a Canadian Junior National team athlete and three-time U Sports National Champion. Wilson first competed in rhythmic gymnastics at the national level before taking up her parents' sport at the age of 14. She attended high school at Fort Richmond Collegiate.\nShe is married to the professional ice hockey player Tom Wilson.\nUniversity career.\nWilson played university volleyball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos in the 2011–12 season. Her departure from UCSB, after one semester on the indoor team, occurred because there was no opportunity to play beach volleyball during the second semester when the NCAA sand program at UCSB did not become a collegiate sport. Wilson was on a double scholarship at UCSB to play on their indoor and beach volleyball teams. She then joined the Manitoba Bisons in time for the 2012–13 season where she finished sixth in the Canada West conference in kills per set and sixth in points per set. In the following season, she was named a Canada West Second-Team All-Star as she finished fifth in kills and points per game. That year, the Bisons lost the conference championship to the UBC Thunderbirds, but by finishing second, the team qualified for the 2014 CIS women's volleyball championship. The Bisons defeated the Ottawa Gee-Gees, Dalhousie Tigers, and finally the first-seeded UBC Thunderbirds to claim the national championship as Wilson was also named to the Championship All-Star Team.\nWilson has been the recipient of many academic awards at the University of Manitoba including Sport Manitoba's prestigious Princess Royal Pan Am Scholarships and Milt Stegall Scholarship for community service, athletics, and a cumulative GPA above 4.0. Twice she was named Manitoba's Junior Female Athlete of the Year in 2012 and 2013 and a finalist for Female Athlete of the Year in 2013 and 2014.\n2012-16: Original team.\nWilson played on Team Canada's beach volleyball squad with Melissa Humana-Paredes of Toronto from 2012 to 2016. John Child, who competed in three Olympic Games and won a bronze medal at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was the team's coach. Along with Humana-Paredes, Wilson won two bronze medals at the under 23 World Championship (2013 and 2014), and seven medals (3 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze) at the NORCECA Beach Volleyball Circuit between 2013 and 2015. Both reached the semi-finals at the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto and the 2013 Summer Universiade in Kazan, Russia.\nWilson also appeared in Sportnet Magazine's 2013 issue of \"Beauty of Sport\". and in 2016 was an advocate of the Dove Campaign \"My Beauty My Say\".\nIn 2015 and 2016, Wilson competed on the FIVB World Tour in eleven Grand Slam and Open events, and in 2015 reached the round of 16 and a 9th-place finish at the 2015 Beach Volleyball World Championships. She competed (Aug 23–28, 2016) in her final event with partner Melissa, at the Long Beach, California Grand Slam before resuming studies at the University of Manitoba. Playing in Pool-A they lost to Maria Antonelli/Lili BRA (21-11, 23-21) and Ross/Walsh Jennings USA (21-16, 21-17) in straight sets. Playing against Carol/Ana Patrícia of BRA they won in straight sets (21-19, 26-24), placing them 3rd in Pool-A and advancing to the elimination round. The team finished 17th overall. This marked the culmination of 11 FIVB World Tour events that they played in 2016 where they finished top 10 in four events (Vitoria Open, Xiamen Open, Hamburg Major Series, and Olsztyn Grand Slam).\n2017-19: Multiple partners.\nIn January 2017, Wilson began playing with new partner, Kristina May, who was a member of the 2016 Canadian Olympic team playing with then-partner Jamie Broder. The pair made their debut at the opening stop of the 2017 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour in Fort Lauderdale with a 25th-place finish.\nFor the 2018 season, Wilson began competition with another partner, Jamie Broder. They competed together in several competitions together during the season, with their best showing in FIVB competition being a 9th-place finish at Fort Lauderdale. In 2019, Wilson teamed up with Sophie Bukovec for the entirety of the FIVB season. Together, Wilson and Bukovec had a season best 4th-place finish at the Aydın tournament in mid-May, followed shortly thereafter with a 5th-place finish at the Bayden event just under a month later."

Maryland led virtually the entire game except for a brief point with 9:50 left in the basketball game when Indiana took a 44–42 lead. Maryland answered the Hoosier run and ended the game with a 22–8 run to bring home the school's first and coach Gary Williams' only men's basketball National Championship. Senior Juan Dixon was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player (MOP).\nAftermath.\nEach team has not reached the NCAA championship game since the end of this game. Each have also not made it past the Sweet Sixteen since 2002; Davis was let go after the 2005-06 season.\nOn November 19, 2012, Maryland would join the Big Ten Conference, becoming the 13th member to join the conference. Since Indiana was already in the Big Ten Conference, the two teams would later become conference foes and end up facing each other at least once every year."

        "text": "The Russian Fencing Federation (RFF; ; ) is the governing body for the sport of fencing in Russia. It was created in 1992. FFR was formerly a member of the European Fencing Confederation, but its membership was suspended in 2023. It is a member of the Russian Olympic Committee. No Russian fencers will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nHistory.\n1992–2019.\nThe previous incarnation of Russian Fencing Federation was affiliated to the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) in 1914. The modern FFR was created proper in 1992. \nRussian oligarch Alisher Usmanov was president of the Russian Fencing Federation from 2001 to 2009 before being elected president of the FIE. He was concurrently president of the European Fencing Confederation from 2005 to 2009, and then president of the FIE from 2008 until 1 March 2022, when following the imposition of sanctions on him in reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Usmanov announced, in an accusatory letter, that he was stepping down.\n2019–present.\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, the FIE agreed with the European Fencing Confederation to ban Russian fencers, and reallocated competitions that were due to be held in Russia. On 10 March 2023, the FIE became the first Olympic governing body to officially reinstate some of the Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, in time for the start of the qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nIn June 2022, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) President, was removed from his position as European Fencing Confederation (EFC) President at an Extraordinary Congress following a unanimous vote of no confidence in Pozdnyakov in March 2022, due to his xenophobic conduct in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn June 2023, the European Fencing Confederation banned all Russian fencers and officials from participating in its competitions, and suspended the membership in the EFC of the Russian Fencing Federation \"in connection with the rough violation of the ethical principles of dignity, integrity, and relationships with countries, the rules of conduct, and the general principles of sports justice by the Russian Fencing Federation.\"\nIn reaction to the emigration to the United States in 2023 of Russian Olympians épée fencer Sergey Bida (a silver medal winner) and his wife épée fencer Violetta Khrapina Bida, joining two-time junior world sabre champion Konstantin Lokhanov as the second and third Russian Olympian fencers to emigrate to the United States after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in July 2023 the Russian Fencing Federation announced its decision to fire Russian national épée team head coach Alexander Glazunov. Glazunov said \"I don't know why I'm responsible. But it's okay, life goes on.\" In December 2023, \"Pravda\" reported that the Bidas were \"put on wanted list for escaping to USA.\"\nNo Russian fencers will compete in the 2024 Paris Olympics."

        "title": "Rugby union in Montenegro",
        "text": "Rugby union in Montenegro is a minor but growing sport. The game has only recently been developed in the country since its independence in 2006. The governing body is the Montenegrin Rugby Union which was accepted as a member of Rugby Europe (previously FIRA-AER) at the 2014 convention held in Split, Croatia. It is not yet affiliated with World Rugby but is applying for membership.\nHistory.\nTraditionally, international rugby matches were played as FR Yugoslavia until 2003, and then as Serbia and Montenegro from 2003 to 2006.\nIn 2011, the Porto Montenegro company started playing organized touch rugby games. Participation numbers grew and the players progressed to rugby sevens. By 2013 there were four rugby clubs in Montenegro. This was started by Beckett Tucker, Oliver Corlette and Malcolm Blaxall and coached by Milos Kucancanin, Rambo Morrison Tavana Faaletino, David Lowe and Marty Lusty A regional league began in 2014 and fixtures were also arranged with other teams around the former Yugoslavian countries.\nRugby has competition from other popular sports such as water polo, association football, handball and mixed martial arts in Montenegro. Due to the small population of the country, the country is often competing against nations who have a larger population and larger player pool. The biggest rivalry in Montenegro is currently between the clubs Podgorica and Nikšić.\nAn official international sevens squad was named and sent to Greece for the ENC Division B competition in 2014 this was the first time an official national rugby team was sent by Montenegro.\nThe sport of rugby union really kicked off with the annual European Nation's Cup tournament in 2015 where the first official national side played their first match against Estonia in Bar, Montenegro. This was Montenegro's first stint as an independent nation competing in rugby union and the first time the country played at home. The match ended as a win for Montenegro. The following match was a final against Slovakia and ended in defeat.\nMontenegro hosted the ENC 3 competition from the 15th to the 21st of May 2017. It was attended by Bulgaria and Slovakia to make it a three way tournament. The tournament ended with a loss to Slovakia and a win to Bulgaria which are World Rugby ranked opposition.\nMontenegro played Turkey and Bulgaria in ENC 3 2018, with one game being at home and one being away. Montenegro lost to Bulgaria at home convincingly and put on a strong showing in Turkey narrowly losing buy a few points. At the sevens Montenegro put on a good showing but were unlucky not to win many games.\nIn the 2019 season Montenegro failed to take part in the ENC 3 against Turkey and Estonia but did well to secure a 12th place finish (out of 16 teams) at the sevens conference 1 held in Belgrade for 2019 and remain in the conference. Two kids rugby programs were also started in Podgorica and in Tivat. Which is a positive sign for the future that kids will be playing rugby earlier. As well positive news that rugby sevens will be making its debut at the GSSE in 2023 which is a stepping stone forward for smaller nations rugby programs.\nClubs.\nAs of 2022, the following clubs participate actively rugby in Montenegro:\nInactive/defunct clubs.\nThe club's above are currently inactive due to the failure to partake in regular matches this season.\nNational team.\nMontenegro's national teams are known as the Wolves (Vukovi). The country's first international rugby sevens matches were played in 2014 at the ENC Division B championship in Greece. The first match was against the favorites Switzerland, with the game ending with a final score of 15-36 to Switzerland. The team managed to win the bowl and get Montenegro's first achievement in rugby sevens. After a poor 2015 season where the team finished second to last the 2016 team had plenty to make up for. With that the team finished in the cup final with Malta and achieved promotion into Conference 1.\nThe Montenegro national 15-a-side team first played in April 2015 when the country hosted the European Nations Cup Division 3 Competition. On 10 April 2015 The Wolves played the first international match in the country's history, winning a thrilling encounter 29–27 against Estonia in Bar. In the Final Montenegro lost 31–3 against Slovakia in Budva.\nSince then the team played in the second leg of that tournament by travelling up to Estonia to play the hosts Estonia. Estonia won, ending Montenegro's hope for promotion. The team defeated Belarus for their biggest ever victory in an international competition\nFor women's rugby it started off by an invitation to the Rugby Europe Division B tournament after the withdrawal of one of the teams in the tournament. They competed against favourites Denmark for their first match and lost heavily and were unlucky to not get a win in their debut tournament. The women's side got their first win against Bosnia and Herzegovina with the side finishing 12th of 16 teams. This was the first real result for the women's team.\nMontenegro Men's XV played a 15's international test against Gibraltar. It was a poor performance from the men's side as they were heavily defeated 55-7. National caps were awarded.\nIn the 2017 ENC hosted by Montenegro the team lost the first match against Slovakia and won the following against Bulgaria. Each team had a victory and even though Montenegro had scored the most tries and had a better points difference Slovakia had gotten promotion through due to changes in Rugby Europe's tie breaker rules earlier in the year.\nMontenegro sevens competed in Rugby Europe rugby sevens conference 1 in 2017 with a poor set of results due to external factors. With losses in all group matches and small margins in their playoff matches to stay in the conference, it ended a disappointing year for rugby in Montenegro.\nIn the 2018 season the national team played and lost their fixtures against Bulgaria and Turkey respectively.\nCurrently after the recent re-structuring in rugby europe the national team are playing in the south division 2 conference alongside Serbia, Bosnia and Turkey.

The team's colours became yellow, brown, and white and the sparrow was replaced by a crown. As KBRK, the club was successful in the nineties and noughties. \nIn 2012 the club's executive committee decided to return to the name of BRK. The word Royal was removed from the club's name, the colours were reverted to blue and white and a re-styled sparrow replaced the crown. In 2014, the Belgrade Rugby Club (BRK) became Belgrade Rugby Club Red Star (BRK Crvena Zvezda) or BRK Red Star.\nA group of former BRK-KBRK members and players were unhappy with this change and, led by Danijem Stricevicem, decided to split away.

        "text": "The 2016 Six Nations Championship, known as the 2016 RBS 6 Nations due to the tournament's sponsorship by The Royal Bank of Scotland, was the 17th series of the Six Nations Championship, the annual northern hemisphere rugby union championship.\nIt was contested by England, France, defending champions Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. Including the competition's previous incarnations as the Home Nations Championship and Five Nations Championship, it was the 122nd edition of the tournament.\nEngland won the Championship on 13 March with a game to play, winning their first Championship since 2011. On 19 March, they earned the Grand Slam for the 13th time, their first since 2003. \nThe 2016 Championship was the first time in the Six Nations era that both the champions and the wooden spoon \"winners\" had been decided before the final day, as Italy were confirmed to finish in sixth place for the 11th time on 13 March with Scotland's victory over France. Italy went on to lose their final match, and were thus whitewashed for the seventh time. The 29 tries conceded by Italy was also a Championship record, exceeding the 25 tries they conceded in 2000 and 2003.\nStory of the tournament.\nRound 1 (6–7 February).\nThe tournament started with a surprisingly narrow 23–21 win for France over Italy. At one point, Italy had led 18–10 and then 21–20, but a late penalty from Jules Plisson gave France the points. The same day, another tight game saw England retain the Calcutta Cup in a narrow 15–9 win over Scotland, with tries from George Kruis and Jack Nowell. The following day, two of the three tournament favourites, Ireland and Wales, drew 16–16 in Dublin. Ireland had led 13–0 before Wales battled back to lead 16–13. Johnny Sexton's late penalty gave Ireland a share of the spoils.\nRound 2 (13–14 February).\nIreland's defence of the title was damaged further in Week 2 when they were beaten 10–9 in a second successive narrow victory for France. Ireland had led 9–3 from before half-time, but Maxime Médard's 69th minute converted try proved to be the winner. Another comeback later that day saw Wales beat Scotland 27–23 in Cardiff. Scotland had led 13–10 at half time, but tries from Jamie Roberts and George North gave Wales a 27–16 lead before a late Scotland score. On Sunday, England easily beat Italy 40–9 after a tight first half, with Jonathan Joseph scoring a hat-trick of tries.\nRound 3 (26–27 February).\nIn the Friday evening kick-off, Wales maintained their title hopes with a 19–10 win over France. Another George North try helped them to a comfortable 19–3 lead before a France try in the last minute. On Saturday, Scotland won their first Six Nations game in 10 attempts, winning 36–20 in Rome with Greig Laidlaw kicking 21 points. Ireland's title hopes were extinguished when they were beaten 21–10 by England at Twickenham; Ireland had led 10–6 early in the second half, but conceded 15 unanswered points in 13 minutes with tries by Anthony Watson and Mike Brown.\nRound 4 (12–13 March).\nEntering the fourth round of matches, the England-Wales game was touted as a Championship decider, although France – a point behind Wales and two behind England – still had an outside chance of winning it. The first match of the weekend saw Ireland trounce Italy 58–15, running in nine tries. England then beat Wales 25–21 in a thrilling encounter at Twickenham; England had led 25–7 with less than 10 minutes remaining before two converted Wales tries made it a tense ending. England thus won the Triple Crown, and the next day won the Championship outright, as France, needing to win to take the tournament to a final week, lost 29–18 to Scotland in Edinburgh, the Scots' first win over the French in 10 years. In addition to guaranteeing that England would win the tournament, Scotland's victory over France also guaranteed that Italy would finish last and \"win\" the wooden spoon as a result.\nRound 5 (19 March).\nAll three matches were played on the same day in the last round, with England needing to win in Paris to complete the Grand Slam for the first time since 2003. In the first match, Wales scored nine tries to easily beat Italy 67–14 in Cardiff, effectively whitewashing Italy; they had lost all five of their matches. Ireland then beat Scotland 35–25 in Dublin in an open game where the sides shared seven tries. In the final game in Paris, England scored two early tries through Danny Care and Dan Cole but the excellent kicking of Maxime Machenaud – who scored all of his side's points with seven penalties – kept France in the game until two late Owen Farrell penalties stretched England's lead to 31–21, enough to win the game and the Grand Slam, and to leave Farrell the leading points scorer in the Championship.\nFixtures.\nRound 1.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 2.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 3.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 4.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes:\nRound 5.\nNotes:\nNotes:\nNotes: \nBroadcasting.\nIn the United Kingdom, 2016 marked the first year that the tournament was broadcast across both the BBC and ITV, with the BBC broadcasting France, Scotland and Wales home matches and ITV screening England, Ireland and Italy home fixtures. In this first year of the split UK TV deal, the BBC covered eight matches from the tournament, and ITV the other seven. This arrangement will alternate every year for the remainder of the deal to 2021. S4C in Wales will also broadcast every Wales game in Welsh for the remainder of this contract.\nIn France, all of the matches were broadcast on France 2, the traditional French channel for rugby. In the Republic of Ireland, matches are being broadcast by RTÉ. In Italy, all of the matches are being broadcast live on DMAX."

He first went to Boise Junior College (now Boise State University) before transferring to the University of Oregon in Eugene to play for the Webfoots. Wilcox led the Webfoots (now Ducks) to the 1958 Rose Bowl, which they lost 10–7. He graduated from Oregon in 1959.\nPlaying career.\nWilcox was small for a defensive end, drafted late by the Philadelphia Eagles in 1960. He played 12 games while the Eagles won the NFL title that year. Rather than return to the team, Wilcox decided to retire, citing the small salary ($7,500) and the toil it might have taken on his body.\nLater life.\nWith the money he earned from playing football, he bought a house. He originally wanted to enter the military draft, but he decided to instead be a teacher and coach, in part due to deferments offered by the President for math and science teachers. After a few stints at high schools in Portland and Boise, he arrived at Whitman College in 1967. He served as an assistant coach at Whitman College from 1967 to 1975, as they won a share of the conference title. He also served as the men's basketball coach during the 1970s and the women's basketball coach during the 1980s, leading the girls to five playoff appearances, a conference title and 178 wins. He was inducted into the Whitman Hall of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nHe has been married to Remy Barnes for over 50 years and has three children and seven grandkids.

        "text": "The 2015–16 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team represented the University of Kansas in the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, which is the Jayhawks 118th basketball season. The Jayhawks played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse. They were led by 13th year head coach Bill Self and were members of the Big 12 Conference. They finished the season 33–5, 15–3 in Big 12 play to win their 12th consecutive regular season Big 12 title. They defeated Kansas State, Baylor, and West Virginia to be champions of the Big 12 tournament. They received an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament where they were the tournament's overall #1 seed. They defeated Austin Peay, UConn, and Maryland to advance to the Elite Eight where they lost to Villanova.\nThe Jayhawks 12 consecutive regular season Big 12 titles was at the time the longest active consecutive conference title streak in the nation, as well as only being one shy of the NCAA record of 13, which is currently held by UCLA who won 13 in a row between 1967 and 1979.\nIn July 2015, the Jayhawks represented the United States at the World University Games in Gwangju, South Korea. The Jayhawks, along with Nic Moore from SMU and Julian DeBose from Florida Gulf Coast, went 8–0 to win the Gold Medal.\nPreseason.\nWorld University Games.\nIn April 2014, the Kansas basketball team was selected by the United States International University Sports Federation (US-IUSF) to represent the United States in the 2015 World University Games. Kansas was selected as the team to represent the U.S. from the schools that expressed interest. This was the second time a college team represented the United States in the World University Games; University of Northern Iowa had finished 9th in 2007.\nCurrent university students or recent graduates, born between Jan. 1, 1990, and Dec. 31, 1997, were eligible for the 2015 Games. Only U.S. citizens were eligible for the U.S. team; therefore Cheick Diallo, Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk, and Dwight Coleby (from Mali, Ukraine, and Bahamas respectively) were ineligible. The Kansas travel party, consisting of 12 competitors and 11 staff (23 total), left Lawrence on June 28 and lived in the athlete village throughout the Games. There were two non-Jayhawks on the U.S. roster: guards Nic Moore of SMU and Julian DeBose of Florida Gulf Coast, replacing injured Kansas guard Devonte' Graham.\nTeam USA won all their matches in the tournament, beating Germany 84–77 in double overtime on July 13, 2015, to win the gold medal.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4; color:white;\"| World University Games Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4;\"| \n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4; color:white;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4; color:white;\"| Big 12 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#0022B4; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament\nSource: "

        "title": "Kent State Golden Flashes women's basketball",
        "text": "The Kent State Golden Flashes women's basketball team represents Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, United States. The Golden Flashes compete in the Mid-American Conference and last played in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament in 2024. Founded in 1973 as a club team, the Kent State women's basketball team received varsity status in 1975 and played their first official game in January 1976. Through the 2023–24 season, the Flashes have six total appearances in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament along with four Mid-American Conference tournament championships, five MAC overall titles, and nine MAC East division titles. Home games are held at the Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, which has been the team's home venue since 1977. The head coach is Todd Starkey, who was hired April 19, 2016.\nHistory.\nWomen's basketball has been played at Kent State University since shortly after the campus first opened in September 1913, when it was known as the Kent State Normal School. As a teacher training school, the university's early enrollment was predominately female and president John McGilvrey felt that physical activity was important, so four intramural women's basketball teams were organized in early 1914. This basic setup continued through the 1960s in various forms with both women's physical education and intramural sports housed at Wills Gymnasium, the school's original gym. Men's physical education and varsity athletics were moved to the new and larger Men's Physical Education Building in 1950.\nThe passage of Title IX in 1972 resulted first in the establishment of three club-level women's basketball teams in 1973. The current program received varsity status in 1975 and played their home games at Wills Gymnasium for the 1976 and 1976–77 seasons before moving to Memorial Gym for the 1977–78 season. The team's first official game was held January 17, 1976, a 72–56 loss to Ashland College at Wills Gym. The Flashes won their first game on January 31 with a 70–30 victory over John Carroll University and finished 5–6 in their inaugural varsity season after going 1–11 in their final club season. Judy Devine, who was also serving as assistant athletic director and director of the new women's athletic program, was the team's first head coach, holding the position for the first two seasons. She led the team to a 9–8 season in 1976–77 and finished 14–14 as head coach, being succeeded in 1977 by Laurel Wartluft.\nInitially, the team competed in the Ohio Association of Intercollegiate Sports for Women (OAISW) as the Mid-American Conference did not sponsor women's sports until 1981. The OAISW did not include a league schedule, but did have a post-season tournament. In 1979, Kent State was 23–8, their first 20-win season, and finished third at the OAISW tournament. Kent State's best finish was the 1981 tournament, where they lost 67–62 to the Ohio State Buckeyes in the championship game to finish second in the state with a 24–10 record. The following season was the first for Mid-American Conference play as the NCAA began sponsoring women's athletics. Although the Flashes finished tied for third in the conference standings and finished third at the conference tournament, Kent State was the MAC representative for the inaugural NCAA Women's Division I tournament as both the MAC champion and runner-up that season were already committed to the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) and rules prevented players from participating in both tournaments. The Flashes were seeded eighth in the 32-team field, falling to top-seed Southern California in the opening round.\nLaurel Wartluft coached the team through the 1985–86 season, finishing with an overall record of 135–119 () and 28–55 () in the MAC. Wartluft led the team to three consecutive 20-win seasons from 1978–79 through 1980–81 and their first NCAA tournament appearance, but was unable to finish higher than seventh in the MAC after a tie for third place in 1982. She was succeeded by Richard Keast, who coached through the 1988–89 season, compiling an overall record of 33–50 () and 18–30 () in the MAC. Under Keast, the team's best season was his first year, going 15–13 overall and 8–8 for a fourth-place finish in MAC play.\nBob Lindsay.\nFollowing the 1988–89 season, Keast was succeeded by Bob Lindsay. Lindsay would go on to coach the team for the next 23 seasons, earning MAC records with 260 conference wins and 418 wins overall. Under Lindsay, Kent State was a regular MAC contender, as the team posted 15 consecutive winning seasons from 1990–91 through the 2006–07 season, including seven consecutive seasons of 20 wins or more from 1995–96 through 2001–02. Lindsay also led the team to five MAC regular-season, three MAC tournament, and seven MAC East Division titles, including six consecutive MAC East Division championships from 1998 to 2003. Kent State also made four NCAA appearances, had one WNIT bid, and played in seven consecutive MAC tournament championship games during Lindsay's tenure.\nKent State won their first MAC regular-season title in 1996, finishing 24–7 overall and 15–2 in MAC play. Despite a loss to Toledo in the MAC tournament Championship game, the Flashes were selected as an at-large team in the 1996 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, as a tenth seed. In the opening round of the tournament, the Flashes posted their first tournament win with a 72–68 upset win over seventh-seeded Texas A&amp;M. The team fell to second-seeded and host Penn State in the second round.\nThe program's best season in MAC play was the 1997–98 season as they finished 23–7 overall and 18–0 in MAC play, the fourth team in MAC history to accomplish the feat. It was followed by a victory in the MAC tournament championship game over Toledo and an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed. In the NCAA tournament, Kent State fell at fourth-seeded Iowa State, 79–76.\nFollowing a 22–7 season in 1998–99 that featured a second-consecutive MAC East title, but a loss in the 1999 MAC Championship game, the Flashes set a program mark for wins by posting 25 wins in the 1999–2000 season, finishing 25–6 with a 15–1 record in MAC play. After a victory over Toledo in the 2000 MAC tournament championship game at Public Hall in Cleveland, the Flashes were seeded ninth in the NCAA tournament, where they fell to eighth-seeded Arizona 71–60 in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nKent State returned to the MAC tournament championship for a sixth consecutive year in 2001 following their fourth straight MAC East Division title, but fell to top-seeded Toledo in overtime at Gund Arena in Cleveland. The following season, the Flashes won their second MAC regular-season title, their fifth-straight divisional title, and made a seventh-consecutive appearance in the MAC tournament championship game, where they defeated the Ball State Cardinals at Gund Arena. The team advanced to the NCAA tournament as a 14th seed, falling at Kansas State in the opening round.\nThe Flashes won their six straight MAC East title in 2003, but finished 16–13 overall and failed to advance to the MAC tournament championship game for the first time since 1995. The 2003–04 team finished 19–10 overall and made the program's first appearance in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT), where they were defeated at St. Joseph's. They would return to the top of the MAC East in 2005 and to the MAC tournament championship game in 2005 and 2006, but fell to Bowling Green both years. Kent State returned to the postseason in 2010 and 2011 following 20-win seasons, earning bids to the 2010 and 2011 WNIT.\nAt the conclusion of the 2011–12 season where the team went 6–22 overall and 5–11 in the MAC, Bob Lindsay's contract was not renewed by the university. The season was the worst season for the program and for Lindsay since his first season in 1988–89 when the team was 5–22 overall and 5–11 in the MAC and was just the third losing season under Lindsay. Lindsay was \"stunned\" by the firing as were basketball analysts. Athletic director Joel Nielsen stated that the decision to not renew Lindsay's contract was not based on the results of the 2011–12 season, but did not specify details beyond saying he reviewed the \"entire body of work.\" Lindsay finished at Kent State with an overall record of 416–256 (.620) and 260–120 (.684) in the MAC.\nDanielle O'Banion.\nKent State announced the hiring of Danielle O'Banion as head coach on April 18, 2012, under a four-year deal. Prior to coming to Kent, O'Banion has served on the coaching staff at Memphis as an assistant and later as associate head coach and had previously been on staff as an assistant for five seasons at Minnesota and one season at Harvard. She played collegiately at Boston College from 1997 to 2001. O'Banion and the team received national attention in 2014 for O'Banion's fight against cancer after she was diagnosed with Stage II Lymphoma in November. Women's basketball coaches from around the U.S. wore lime green in support.\nThe program continued to struggle, going 3–27 overall and 1–15 in MAC play during O'Banion's first season, followed by a 7–23 overall and 4–14 record in the MAC in 2013—14, and 5–25 overall and 3–15 in the MAC for 2014–15. After finishing the 2015–16 season 6–23 overall and 3–15 in MAC play, the university elected to not renew O'Banion's contract. She concluded her tenure at Kent State with an overall record of 21–98 and a MAC record of 11–59. Todd Starkey, who had previously been an assistant coach at Indiana, was hired April 19, 2016, as the program's sixth head coach.\nTodd Starkey.\nIn his first season as head coach, Todd Starkey led the team to a 19–13 overall record and 13–5 in conference play to win the MAC East division title, the program's first since 2005. The season ended with a loss in the opening round of the WNIT, Kent State's first post-season appearance since 2011. Starkey was honored as the MAC Coach of the Year, the first KSU women's basketball coach to win the award since Bob Lindsay in 1998 and third overall. Senior Larissa Lurken was named MAC Player of the Year, the program's sixth recipient of the award and first since 2006.\nMAC tournament.\nKent State has won four Mid-American Conference women's basketball tournament titles, winning in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2024. The team has made 12 total appearances in the MAC championship game, including seven consecutive from 1996 to 2002. They are 39–31 in the tournament through 2024.\n\"Championship game victories highlighted in ██ yellow; losses in ██ wheat\"\n‡=\"game and remainder of 2020 MAC women's basketball tournament canceled due to coronavirus pandemic\"\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament.\nKent State has played in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament six times, making the 1996 tournament as an at-large team, with automatic bids to the 1982, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2024 tournaments. Their combined record is 1–6, the win a 72–68 victory over Texas A&amp;M in the opening round of the 1996 tournament.\nWomen's National Invitation tournament.\nKent State has made six appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT). Their record is 2–5.\nFacilities.\nHome games are held in the 6,327-seat Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center, commonly known as the MAC Center, which is shared with the KSU men's basketball, wrestling, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball teams. The MAC Center also houses the Kent State Athletic Department and has offices for all Kent State varsity athletic coaches. Additionally, the facility is used for commencement exercises, concerts, and other special events. The arena features a parquet floor and a central hanging scoreboard along with two video boards in opposite corners. It opened in 1950 and is the oldest arena the Mid-American Conference and 20th oldest in college basketball. The MAC Center has served as home of the Kent State women's basketball team since 1977.\nFor the team's first season in 1976, the Flashes played home games at Wills Gymnasium, which had previously served as the home of the men's basketball team from 1925 to 1950. By 1976, the seating capacity of Wills Gym had been reduced from the original 4,000 seats to around 100 and the building was in a dilapidated state. During the 1977 season, as part of the university complying with the requirements of Title IX, five of the seven scheduled home games were held at the MAC Center, then known as Memorial Gymnasium, with the remaining two at Wills. The first game played by the team in the MAC Center was on January 12, 1977, a season-opening 49–46 loss to Cleveland State. The Flashes recorded their first win at the MAC Center on February 2, 1977, a 64–62 win over Ashland. The team's final game at Wills was a 52–51 win over Wooster on February 12, 1977. Beginning in the 1977–78 season, all home games were moved to the MAC Center, which received its current name in 1992 following an extensive renovation. From 1997 through 2001, the team had a 43-game winning streak in the building, and posted a 50-game conference winning streak between 1996 and 2002. The record for largest crowd for a Kent State women's basketball game is 3,516, set on February 23, 2006 against the Miami RedHawks.\nRivalries.\nThe Golden Flashes' arch-rival is the Akron Zips from the University of Akron, a fellow member of the Mid-American Conference East Division and a traditional rival in multiple sports, located approximately southwest of Kent in Akron, Ohio. The Zips and Flashes first met during Kent State's final year as a club team and met for the first official time as varsity teams on February 14, 1976 at Memorial Hall in Akron during Kent State's first season as a varsity team. The Zips won the inaugural varsity meeting 73–67 and the two teams played in every successive season except for the 1982–83 and 1988–89 seasons. Akron joined the Mid-American Conference in 1992, giving the rivals two meetings per season.\nFor many years, the rivalry was one-sided in favor of the Golden Flashes. Following the 2008 games, both Kent State wins, the Flashes built a 43–4 lead in the series, which included a run from 1989 to 2008 where they won 23 of 24, among them five games where the Flashes had 100 or more points in the game. Akron won at James A. Rhodes Arena in 1998 to end a 15-game Kent State winning streak in the series that began in 1989. Kent State won the rematch in 1998 when the teams met in Kent to start an 18-game series winning streak that ended in 2009 with a Zips win in Akron. Between 2009 and 2016, the Zips took 11 of 16 meetings, including eight in a row before Kent State won both games in 2017. Akron won for the first time in the MAC Center since 1988 with a 77–71 win in 2013, ending a 20-game losing streak in the building. The win also marked the first time the Zips not only won consecutive games, but also swept the season meetings in the series. Through the 2023–24 season, the series stands at 60–18 in favor of Kent State. The game is also part of the multi-sport Wagon Wheel Challenge.\nKent State also had a long-standing rivalry with the Toledo Rockets during much of the 1990s and early 2000s as the teams were regularly in contention for the conference championship and met yearly in games with conference championship implications. The two teams consistently finished first and second in the mid-1990s with Kent State taking the regular-season titles over second-place Toledo in 1996, 1998, and 2000, and the Flashes finishing second to the Rockets in 1997 and 2001. Both teams split their meetings during the 1999 regular season and tied for the title. Kent State has played Toledo in the Mid-American Conference women's basketball tournament championship game seven times, the first in 1992 and then again for six consecutive seasons from 1996 through 2001. The Rockets have taken five of the seven championship game meetings and took four of the six from 1996 to 2001. Through 2023–24, Toledo leads the overall series 49–35.\nOutside the Mid-American Conference, Kent State has played regional rivals Cleveland State and Youngstown State more frequently than any other teams, with both series dating back to 1976 during the Flashes' inaugural varsity season. Both the Vikings and Penguins are members of the Horizon League and play the Flashes on a semi-regular basis. Through the 2023–24 season, Kent State has played Cleveland State 29 times, with the most recent game in 2015. The Flashes lead the series 16–13 following a 60–49 Cleveland State win in Kent. The Flashes' series with Youngstown State spans 45 games and was last played in 2022. Kent State leads the series with YSU 32–14 following a 68–59 KSU win at Youngstown in the opening round of the 2022 Women's National Invitation Tournament."

The game was played on April 3, 2000 at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana and matched No. 1-seeded Michigan State against No. 5-seeded Florida. The Spartans defeated the Gators, who were appearing in their first championship game, 89–76, earning the Spartans their second national championship.\nParticipants.\nFlorida Gators.\nThe Gators were the SEC regular season champions, winning a share of the title with a 12–4 conference record. They earned a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament where they advanced to the Final Four and then made the school's first ever appearance in the NCAA championship game where they lost to Michigan State.\nMichigan State Spartans.\nThe Spartans finished the regular season 13–3 to win a share of the Big Ten regular season championship for the third consecutive year. They also won the Big Ten tournament championship for the second consecutive year. As a result of their strong finish in the regular season, the Spartans were awarded the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. From there, the Spartans cruised to their third consecutive Sweet Sixteen with wins over Valparaiso, and Utah. MSU continued their national championship push by reaching their second consecutive Final Four with wins over Syracuse and Iowa State. MSU won every game by double digits despite playing the best possible seed in each round. In their Final Four matchup, Michigan State faced off against Big Ten foe, Wisconsin, beating them in a close game, 53–41.\nGame summary.\nMichigan State senior Mateen Cleaves limped his way to the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the 2000 NCAA Tournament. Cleaves sprained his ankle with 16:18 to play in the second half, and this was after Florida had trimmed Michigan State's double digit halftime lead to 50–44. Cleaves returned about four minutes later, and immediately helped lead the Spartans on a 16–6 run to put the game out of reach. The lone top-seed remaining would bring order to a tournament filled with upsets as they salted away the victory for the school's second national championship (1979). Michigan State coach Tom Izzo earned his first title in his second straight final four appearance. Morris Peterson led the Spartans with 21 points.\nAs of 2024, Michigan State's 2000 team is the last Big Ten team to win a national championship."

        "text": "Horse Racing is an equestrian video game released by Mattel Electronics for its Intellivision video game console in 1980. Although primarily a sports video game, \"Horse Racing\" received Mattel's \"Gaming Network\" branding, due to its pari-mutuel betting on horses during the game.\nThe game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional \"Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables\" at a fictional western Kentucky race track called \"Plympton Downs\" (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton). Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match). These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbers—unlike in regular horse racing).\n\"Horse Racing\" was also released by Sears for their Intellivision private-label clone, the \"Super Video Arcade\".\nGameplay.\nIn Intellivision's original \"Horse Racing\" game, 6 players (bettors) begin each of the 10 races on the simulated match program by checking out the race program screen; 4 horses are entered for each race, with bettors starting out with a $750 simulated bankroll. For each of the 4 horses entered into a race, the odds—along with past performances—are listed (accessed by a side action button during placing bets). Each bettor then keys in his/her player number (from 1 to 6 on the keypad), enters a bet pay amount against \nhis/her bankroll, then—places the bet (of a win or exacta only—by pressing [9] on the keypad) on his/her selection of horse(s). After all bets are made, a keypad press of [0] then [ENTER] starts the race.\nThe call to the post then plays. After a brief silence, the starting gate opens up, and 4 Thoroughbred horses run away from the gate. During the actual race, the disk/joystick is used to move a horse along, while the side action buttons perform either of 2 functions (top to coax a horse along, bottom to whip it). Each race takes place on any of 3 different types of track: dry, turf (grass), or muddy; additionally, the races run in length from 3 to 10 furlongs. After the horses cross the finish line, the results are shown on the tote board as colorful horse heads (reading from right to left in finishing order), along with the elapsed time of the race. The play screen then switches to the bet placing screen for the next race; after the full 10-race match program has run, a final GAME OVER screen shows up, with the bettors' final bankroll amounts.\nThe track is horizontally scrolling, with its color changing according to the racing surface (khaki for dry, pine green for turf, and brown for muddy). A 4-stall starting gate with the horses loaded therein is shown at the start of each race. The cheering crowd fanfare sound is played as the horses cross the finish line.\nThe Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables.\nThe RTS is a fictional stable in where the race horses featured in the game are housed. Each horse has differing abilities and personalities. These are referred to by their colors (unlike in actual horse races where they would get entrant post position numbers in relation to the inner rail). These are assigned a button on the keypad as follows:\nOn the original prototype ROM, there was a BLACK horse called Black Maurauder; however, he got dropped from the original release of the game, and got replaced by Snowy Guy.\nLegacy.\n\"Horse Racing\" is included in the \"Intellivision Lives!\" game collection."

        "text": "The men's sprint event at the 1980 Summer Olympics took place on 23–26 July 1980 in Krylatskoye Sports Complex Velodrome. There were 15 competitors from 15 nations, with three additional non-starters. The event was won by Lutz Heßlich of East Germany, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint. Yavé Cahard took silver, extending France's medal streak to five Games despite the retirement of Daniel Morelon (who had medaled in the past four). Sergei Kopylov of the host Soviet Union earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. The only returning quarterfinalist from 1976 was champion Anton Tkáč of Czechoslovakia. France's Daniel Morelon, who had taken a medal in the last four Games, had retired in 1977. Lutz Heßlich of East Germany was the 1979 world champion and the favorite in Moscow.\nLibya and Zimbabwe each made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 17th appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches. The 1980 competition, despite an even smaller starting field than in 1976 (15 cyclists, down from 18), actually increased the number of rounds back to 10 (from eight in 1976). This format used six main rounds (first round, second round, 1/8 finals, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) and three repechages, including a two-round first repechage. Only one cyclist was eliminated after the first three rounds (round 1 and the two-round first repechage).\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nSergei Kopylov recorded 10.55 seconds in the fourth heat of round 2, 10.56 seconds, in the first race of the bronze medal match, and 10.47 seconds in the second race of the bronze medal match."

        "title": "2023 FIFA Women's World Cup",
        "text": "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup () was the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international women's football championship contested by women's national teams and organised by FIFA. The tournament, which took place from 20 July to 20 August 2023, was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand. It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation, as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations, as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation. It was also the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. \nThis tournament was the first to feature an expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24, replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022. The opening match was won by co-host New Zealand, beating Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023 and achieving their first Women's World Cup victory. \nSpain were crowned champions after defeating reigning European champions England 1–0 in the final. It was the first time a European nation had won the Women's World Cup since 2007 and Spain's first title, although their victory was marred by the Rubiales affair. Spain became the second nation to win both the women's and men's World Cup since Germany in the 2003 edition. In addition, they became the first nation to concurrently hold the FIFA women's U-17, U-20, and senior World Cups. Sweden would claim their fourth bronze medal at the Women's World Cup while co-host Australia achieved their best placing yet, finishing fourth. Japanese player Hinata Miyazawa won the Golden Boot scoring five goals throughout the tournament. Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.\nOf the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round of 16 (where they lost to France; coincidentally, the result of this fixture was similar to the men's World Cup in Qatar, where France defeated Morocco in the semi-final). The United States were the two-time defending champions, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.\nAustralia's team, nicknamed the Matildas, performed better than expected, and the event saw many Australians unite to support them. The Matildas, who beat France to make the semi-finals for the first time, saw record numbers of fans watching their games, their 3–1 loss to England becoming the most watched television broadcast in Australian history, with an average viewership of 7.13 million and a peak viewership of 11.15 million viewers.\nIt was the most attended edition of the competition ever held.\nOverview.\nThe FIFA Women's World Cup is a professional association football (soccer) tournament contested by senior women's national football teams, organised by FIFA. The tournament, held every four years and one year after the men's World Cup, was first played in 1991 in China, and was expanded to 32 teams beginning with the 2023 edition. The tournament is contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams. The defending champions were the United States, who defeated the Netherlands 2–0 in the 2019 final. The event took place over a period of a month, from 20 July to 20 August, in Australia and New Zealand. This Women's World Cup was the first co-hosted tournament, and also the first senior World Cup to be held across multiple confederations. In addition, it was the first senior tournament to be held in Oceania, the first Women's World Cup in the Southern Hemisphere, and the third to be held in the Asia-Pacific region.\nSchedule.\nThe match schedule was announced by FIFA on 1 December 2021, with kick-off times confirmed on 24 October 2022, two days after the final draw.\nThe opening match of the tournament, between co-host New Zealand and Norway, was played on 20 July 2023 at Eden Park. The inaugural match played in Australia, was between Australia playing against the Republic of Ireland on the same day at Stadium Australia, after a venue change due to strong ticketing demand.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize pool was USD 110 million, $80 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.\nAt previous tournaments, FIFA paid total prize money to the national associations, but for the 2023 Women's World Cup it was set to award prize payments directly to players as well as the associations. This came as a result of reports in the women's game that a number of national associations were withholding competition prize money from players and/or not paying them at all. In March 2023, global player union FIFPRO sent a letter signed by players from around the world to FIFA, challenging FIFA to make prize money in the men's and women's tournaments equal and to ensure at least 30% of prize money in the women's tournament made it to the players. While FIFA did not match the prize money of the men's tournament, it did significantly increase it, with more than half set to be paid to players directly.\nJust before the tournament, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced that the player payments would still be paid to the associations, and that FIFA planned to audit the associations to make sure the money got to the players. Football administrator Lise Klaveness expressed concern over what she felt sounded like reneging on the promise, both for the players and for FIFA's credibility. During the tournament, Infantino admitted that FIFA had simply made recommendations to associations on how much to pay players, and they could not reasonably check.\nHost selection.\nBidding began for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup on 19 February 2019. Member associations interested in hosting the tournament had to submit a declaration of interest by 15 March, and provide the completed bidding registration by 16 April. However, FIFA revised the bidding timeline as the tournament expanded to 32 teams on 31 July. Other member associations interested in hosting the tournament then had until 16 August to submit a declaration of interest, while the completed bidding registration of new member associations and re-confirmation of prior bidders was due by 2 September.\nNine countries initially indicated interest in hosting the events: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, South Korea (with interest in a joint bid with North Korea), New Zealand and South Africa. Belgium expressed interest in hosting the tournament following the new deadline but later dropped out, as did Bolivia, in September 2019. Australia and New Zealand later announced they would merge their bids in a joint submission. Brazil, Colombia, and Japan joined them in submitting their bid books to FIFA by 13 December. However, both Brazil and Japan later withdrew their bids in June 2020 before the final voting.\nOn 25 June 2020, Australia and New Zealand won the bid to host the Women's World Cup. The decision came after a vote by the FIFA Council, with the winning bid earning 22 votes, while Colombia earned 13. Neither country had previously hosted a senior FIFA tournament. This was the first Women's World Cup to be hosted in multiple countries, and only the second World Cup tournament to do so, following the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea. It was also the first FIFA Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first senior FIFA tournament to be held in Oceania, and the first FIFA tournament to be hosted across multiple confederations (with Australia in the AFC and New Zealand in the OFC). Australia became the second association from the AFC to host the Women's World Cup, after China in both 1991 and 2007.\nFormat.\nIn July 2019, Infantino proposed an expansion of the Women's World Cup from 24 to 32 teams, starting with the 2023 edition, and doubling the tournament's prize money. The proposal came following the success of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and the prior edition of the tournament in 2015, which after increasing from 16 to 24 teams set an attendance record for all FIFA competitions besides the men's FIFA World Cup. Expanding the tournament to allow eight additional participating teams gave more member associations a greater opportunity to qualify for the final tournament. This fostered the growing reach and professionalisation of the women's game.\nOn 31 July, the FIFA Council unanimously decided to expand the tournament to 32 teams, featuring eight groups of four.\nThe tournament opened with a group stage consisting of eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams progressing from each group to a knockout tournament featuring 16 teams. The number of games played overall increased from 52 to 64. The tournament replicated the format of the men's FIFA World Cup used between 1998 and 2022. For the first time since the 2002 FIFA World Cup, both qualified teams from each group were kept on the same side of the draw in the knockout stage, meaning they could potentially meet again in the semi-final. This was to minimise travel between Australia and New Zealand and to ensure both host nations remained in their own country up to the semi-finals should they qualify.\nVenues.\nAustralia and New Zealand proposed 13 possible venues across 12 host cities for the tournament in the bid book submitted to FIFA, suggesting a minimum of 10 stadiums be used—5 in each country. The original proposal of the joint bid would have seen the venues divided into three main travel hubs: South Hub, containing Perth, Adelaide, Launceston and Melbourne; East Hub, containing Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne and Launceston; and New Zealand Hub, containing Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. The Sydney Football Stadium was the only new stadium, undergoing a major renovation during the bid period, replacing the old football stadium on the same site and opening on 28 August 2022.\nThe bid evaluation was released on 10 June 2020 by FIFA, which noted that the majority of the stadiums listed in the bid meet FIFA's hosting requirements with capacity, aside from Adelaide and Auckland, which did not meet the minimum requirements capacity wise for stages of the competition proposed for. Most stadiums featured in the bid were planned to have minor renovations with new floodlighting, pitch renovations, in addition to gender-neutral changing rooms in time for the tournament.\nOn 31 March 2021, FIFA announced the final host city and venue selections. Five cities and six stadiums were used in Australia, along with four cities and stadiums in New Zealand. From the proposed venues, Newcastle and Launceston were not selected in Australia and Christchurch was omitted in New Zealand. Eden Park in Auckland hosted the opening game, with Stadium Australia in Sydney hosting the final match. As a part of the branding, all cities used native names (Indigenous in Australia and Māori in New Zealand) alongside their English names in an effort to \"reconcile and respect the original owners of the land\". They were: Tarntanya (Adelaide), Meanjin (written as Meaanjin; Brisbane), Naarm (Melbourne), Boorloo (Perth), Gadigal (Eastern Sydney; for Sydney Football Stadium), Wangal (Western Sydney; for Stadium Australia), Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland), Ōtepoti (Dunedin), Kirikiriroa (Hamilton), and Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington).\nEden Park, Auckland hosted New Zealand's opening match; Stadium Australia, Sydney hosted Australia's opening match (both group stages). Lang Park, Brisbane, hosted the third-place match on 19 August; Stadium Australia hosted the final which was held on 20 August.\nThe World Cup forced many domestic Australian sporting teams to move matches from grounds under the FIFA lockout, particularly those in the National Rugby League.\nTeam base camps \nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the Women's World Cup tournament. FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for the 29 qualified participating nations on 11 December 2022, with the remaining 3 qualified teams selecting their base camps after the Play-off Tournament. FIFA later confirmed the last remaining three base camps for the play-off tournament winners on 21 March 2023. It was the first World Cup to have dedicated base camps for the 32 participating nations.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nFIFA's confederations organised their qualifications through continental championships, with the exception of UEFA which organised its own qualifying competition. Australia and New Zealand, as co-hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament, leaving the remaining 207 FIFA member associations eligible to enter qualification if they chose to do so. Australia competed at the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup, whilst New Zealand did not enter the OFC Women's Nations Cup the same year. The reigning Women's World Cup champions United States competed in qualification through the CONCACAF W Championship.\nThe Chadian and Pakistani football associations were suspended by FIFA, thus excluding them from entering qualifications. Rwanda, Sudan, DR Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe entered qualification but withdrew later. Kenya withdrew before the second round of qualifiers. North Korea and Turkmenistan withdrew from the Women's Asian Cup qualifiers due to safety concerns and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Iraq withdrew after the AFC draw. Due to the uncertainty of women's sport after the Taliban takeover of the country, Afghanistan withdrew from qualification. Due to COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks in their squads, Women's Asian Cup hosts India withdrew from qualification. American Samoa withdrew due to continuing difficulties related to the pandemic. Russia were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe allocation of slots for each confederation was confirmed by the FIFA Council on 25 December 2020. The slots for the two host nations were taken directly from the quotas allocated to their confederations.\nA ten-team play-off tournament decided the final three spots at the Women's World Cup. The play-off slot allocation was as follows:\nOf the 32 nations qualified for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2019. Haiti, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Vietnam and Zambia made their debuts at the FIFA Women's World Cup. This World Cup was the first ever FIFA tournament the Philippines played in. This was Panama, Portugal and Vietnam's first ever FIFA women's competition, having only taken part in various FIFA men's tournaments. Zambia made history as the first landlocked country in Africa to qualify for a World Cup for either sex. Morocco became the first-ever Arab country to qualify for the Women's World Cup, while the Republic of Ireland marked their first-ever debut at any senior women's tournament. Denmark made their first appearance in 16 years after missing three consecutive tournaments, their last appearance being in 2007. Costa Rica, Colombia and Switzerland returned to the tournament after missing the previous one in 2019. Italy qualified for two consecutive women's World Cups for the first time in their history, after three sporadic appearances in 1991, 1999 and 2019. Africa had four representatives for the first time in the competition's history.\nThailand, Cameroon, Chile, and Scotland, all of whom qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup, did not qualify for the 2023 tournament. Iceland was the highest ranked team in the FIFA Women's World Rankings that failed to qualify, ranked 16th at the time. Zambia were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 81st at the time.\nThe qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Women's World Ranking before the tournament were:\nAFC (6)\nCAF (4)\nCONCACAF (6)\nCONMEBOL (3)\nOFC (1)\nUEFA (12)\nSquads.\nEach team had to provide to FIFA a preliminary squad of between 35 and 55 players, which FIFA did not publish. From the preliminary squad, each team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 9 July 2023. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nDraw.\nThe final draw took place at the Aotea Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, on 22 October 2022 at 19:30 NZDT (), prior to the completion of qualification. The three winners of the inter-confederation play-off were not known at the time of the draw.\nRetired American international and two-time Women's World Cup winner Carli Lloyd and CNN International sports presenter Amanda Davies conducted the draw. Each confederation had a retired international representing them as a draw assistant: Maia Jackman of New Zealand for the OFC and Julie Dolan of Australia for the AFC, alongside men's internationals Ian Wright of England for UEFA, Alexi Lalas of the United States for CONCACAF, Geremi of Cameroon for the CAF and 2002 World Cup winner Gilberto Silva of Brazil for CONMEBOL. Snowboarding Olympic gold medalist Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand and four-time swimming Olympic gold medalist Cate Campbell of Australia also assisted the draw.\nFor the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings of 13 October 2022. Pot one contained both co-hosts New Zealand and Australia (both automatically placed in positions A1 and B1, respectively) along with the best six teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams being allocated into the following pot (pot three). Pot four contained the lowest ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the three inter-confederation play-off winners. With the exception of UEFA, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn in the same group. However, since each inter-confederation play-off group contained multiple confederations, the placeholders were identified by the seeded teams in their respective play-off pathways to avoid any draw constraints. The draw started with pot one and ended with pot four, with the team selected being allocated to the first available group alphabetically. Pot 1 teams were automatically drawn to position 1 of each group, with the following positions drawn for the remaining pots. The pots for the draws are shown below.\nOfficiating.\nIn January 2023, the FIFA Referees Committee announced the list of 33 referees, 55 assistant referees, and 19 video assistant referees (VAR) for the tournament. Of the 33 referees, FIFA included 2 each from Australia, Canada, South Korea, and the United States.\nFrance's Stéphanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan, who became the first female referees to officiate the men's World Cup in 2022, were among those selected for the Women's World Cup. They were also joined by female assistant referees Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina, who also participated at the men's tournament.\nHeba Saadieh became the first Palestinian and Arab female referee to officiate at a World Cup of either gender. Firas Abu Hilal, secretary general of the Palestinian Football Association labelled Saadia as \"a role model for Palestinian women who aspire to achieve success and greatness\" and that she \"has proven the ability of Palestinian women to excel in any field\".\nThe VAR at the tournament had the spoken explanations broadcast in the stadium and on television as part of a year-long trial of the technique intended to give more transparency to often-controversial decisions. Other sports with video referees already used the measure, with FIFA also having implemented it at the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup and 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\nOn 18 August 2023, FIFA announced that American referee Tori Penso would adjudicate the final at Stadium Australia.\nCeremonies.\nOpening ceremonies.\nThere were two opening ceremonies, one before each kick-off game in the two host nations on 20 July 2023. The first took place at Eden Park, Auckland, ahead of the opening game of the competition between New Zealand and Norway. The ceremonies both featured indigenous welcomes, fireworks, dancing and live music, before a moment of silence. A few hours before the opening ceremony, a shooting occurred in downtown Auckland during which three people, including the assailant, were killed. A moment of silence was held for the attack victims.\nThe Eden Park ceremony was noted to be very brief. It began with Māori and indigenous Australian artists; colour and culture representing the indigenous people featured in the ceremony, with a haka being performed as well. There was a dance with groups of dancers representing each nation competing at the tournament, and a montage of star players from all the participants. To close the ceremony, New Zealand singer Benee and Australian singer Mallrat performed the tournament's official song, \"Do It Again\".\nAt Stadium Australia, Sydney, Indigenous Australian artists performed.\nClosing ceremonies.\nThe tournament's closing ceremony took place at Stadium Australia, Sydney, on 20 August 2023, ahead of the Final. The ceremony featured a Welcome to Country, and a performance from Australian singer Tones and I.\nThere was also an extended pre-game ceremony featuring a Māori poi performance prior to the first semi-final at Eden Park, Auckland as it was the final match to be held in New Zealand.\nImpact.\nThe performance of the Australian national women's team (the Matildas) greatly increased public interest in the sport. In a statement following Australia's win in the quarter-finals, FIFA said \"football is the only subject on everyone's lips\" in the nation, having an \"enormous impact\" on the Australian public. In the lead-up to the tournament, more kits representing the Australian women's team were sold than for the national men's team (the Socceroos), for the first time. By the end of the tournament, the Matildas had become Australia's most valuable sporting team, with the worth of their brand increasing fivefold. Writing for \"The Guardian\", former professional soccer player Craig Foster said: \"We are not so much watching a national team compete, as a changing nation at play,\" citing the Matildas' performance for \"overturn[ing] misconceptions of women's sport\" and inspiring young women. As a direct result of the team's success, on 19 August 2023, the Australian government pledged $200 million to improve women's sporting facilities.\nAustralian TV broadcast viewership records were broken multiple times, with the country's match against France drawing about 4.17 million viewers on the Seven Network. Less than a week later, their match against England marked the most-watched broadcast in Australian history, averaging 7.13 million viewers, with a total of 11.15 million watching at one point. Live viewing sites were set up in cities around the country, with major stadiums being used to show the match in Sydney to cope with massive crowds. Both the Prime Minister of Australia, Anthony Albanese, and other state leaders hinted at a public holiday if the Matildas were to win the World Cup.\nThe success of the tournament and the high viewership increased support for Australia and New Zealand to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup. The tournament netted NZ$109.5 million to New Zealand's economy, which was more than double the projected $46.3 million.\nNew Zealand Football have already stated a 25% increase in girls and women playing football occurred in New Zealand as of 2023, with more expected to play in 2024, the first full season after the conclusion of the tournament. The tournament has also left its effect on the New Zealand community, with 30 sports venues receiving upgrades for the tournament.\nGroup stage.\nThe group stage was played from 20 July to 3 August. Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each). If the score was still level after extra time, the winners were determined by a penalty shoot-out.\nAwards.\nThe following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper)\nAdditionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Colombia's Linda Caicedo for her goal in the group stage match against Germany.\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\nA player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nMarketing.\nBranding.\nThe official emblem was jointly designed by Toronto-based studio Public Address and Los Angeles-based Works Creative Agency and unveiled on 28 October 2021 during a live show. The emblem featured a football encircled by 32 coloured squares, reflecting the expanded field of the tournament, and the natural terrains of the two host nations. The overall branding of the tournament featured designs reflecting the host nations' Indigenous peoples, created by Australian Kalkatungu artist Chern'ee Sutton and Māori artist Fiona Collis. Furthermore, the tournament's branding also incorporated the native names of all host cities. Alongside the emblem, the official slogan of the tournament, \"Beyond Greatness\", reflected FIFA's goal for the event to further expand the prominence of women's football, was also revealed. The names of the host cities in their native names (the local Australian Aboriginal languages and Māori in New Zealand) were used as part of the official branding.\nTicketing.\nApproximately 1.4 million tickets were sold or distributed by 19 July 2023, setting a new tournament record. Sluggish sales in New Zealand resulted in 20,000 free tickets being issued by sponsor Xero.\nMerchandise.\n\"FIFA 23\" featured the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup mode; the video game update was released on 27 June 2023, replicating the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament and featuring the 32 qualified teams.\nBroadcasting rights.\nThe 2023 Women's World Cup was the first Women's World Cup to have its broadcasting rights sold as a standalone product rather than being packaged as a bonus of purchasing broadcasting rights for the Men's World Cup. FIFA stated that they saw \"huge interest\" in the separate bidding process and hoped for more regional partners to sign on. FIFA set an aim to reach a global audience of 2 billion, up from 1.12 billion at the previous edition of the tournament in France.\nIn October 2022, FIFA rejected multiple bids from various public and private broadcasters for what it described as significantly under-priced bids, urging broadcasters to bid more, saying it is what the women's game deserves. Some European broadcasters were concerned about the timezone difference affecting viewership figures, something that was not an issue with the France-hosted 2019 Women's World Cup, while Gianni Infantino threatened a media blackout for Europe's \"big five\" (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) if they did not offer more. The issue was resolved by the middle of June 2023, five weeks before the tournament, with all territories having deals. A deal between Japanese broadcaster NHK and FIFA was announced for the last uncovered major market a week before start of the tournament.\nSymbols.\nMascot.\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 19 October 2022. The mascot's name is Tazuni, which is a portmanteau of the Tasman Sea and \"Unity\". She is a little penguin (\"Eudyptula minor\"), endemic to New Zealand — FIFA incorrectly stated this penguin (\"E. minor\") was endemic in Australia, where a closely related species (\"Eudyptula novaehollandiae\") was described as new and distinct in 2016.\nMatch ball.\nOn 24 January 2023, The word \"Oceaunz\" was unveiled as the official match ball for the tournament by Adidas.\nOceaunz's design was inspired by the unique natural landscapes of the two host nations, with visuals nodding to the vast mountains of New Zealand and Australia's connection with the Indian Ocean. Its name was a portmanteau based on the tournament's geographical location: Oceania, Australia, and New Zealand. Oceaunz featured the same connected ball technology as was seen in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This provided precise ball data, which was made available to video assistant referees in real-time. It was previously used at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.\nThe match ball for the semi-finals, third place match, and final, the Oceaunz Final Pro, was revealed on 14 August 2023. It differed from the regular Oceaunz with an orange and gold colouration, reflecting the sunsets across the Sydney skyline, where the final was held.\nMusic.\nThere were several official songs for the 2023 Women's World Cup. The official theme song, \"Unity\" by British DJ and music producer Kelly Lee Owens, was released on 28 October 2021 at the same time as the official emblem and slogan unveiling. An instrumental song with non-lyric vocals, it was played at half-time of every match. On 29 June 2023, the official song of the tournament, \"Do It Again\" by New Zealand singer Benee and Australian singer Mallrat, and its lyric video were released. In July 2023, the \"official walk-out track\" for the matches at the tournament was revealed to be \"Bring It On\" by Australian singer Tones and I, American rapper BIA and French-Senegalese singer-songwriter Diarra Sylla.\nOther songs were independently produced for the tournament. The Nike player commercials \"Let It Rip\", depicting Megan Rapinoe as an All-American Hero, and \"Like a Lioness\", showcasing the England team, featured original songs. The latter (also called \"Like a Lioness\") was performed by Ms Banks, who had previously performed the theme song of the BBC's coverage of the 2019 Women's World Cup. A supergroup of female artists, Hope FC, also released \"Call Me a Lioness\", an anthemic song inspired by the England team (better known as the Lionesses). Hope FC featured British musicians including Melanie C, Self Esteem, Alex Greenwood of Sports Team, Olivia Dean, Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, and Shura (a former youth player herself).\nProgressive actions.\nIndigenous flags and names.\nFootball Australia CEO James Johnson indicated early on in planning that displaying flags representing Indigenous Australians and Indigenous New Zealanders was important to the host nations, and were discussing with FIFA whether this would be permitted at the same time as they and others were discussing captain's armbands. A captain's armband highlighting rights for Indigenous peoples was approved by FIFA in June 2023, with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags (Australian Aboriginal Flag and Torres Strait Islander Flag), and New Zealand Māori flag (Tino Rangatiratanga) approved in July 2023. The extended wait for approval, especially after the armband decision had been announced, prompted Football Australia to seek further clarification. FIFA permitted the relevant flags to be flown alongside the national flags of Australia and New Zealand at all venues, giving them the same prominent status upon recommendation from Indigenous consultants and the governments of both host nations. Previously, the Australia team displaying the Aboriginal flag before matches had caused controversy.\nIn a sign of respect for the traditional custodians of the land, indigenous names for the host cities were used alongside the English names in branding.\nPlayer advocacy.\nClimate action.\nOn 13 July 2023, a group of 44 players, led by Denmark's Sofie Junge Pedersen and facilitated by Common Goal and Football for Future, announced that they would combat the carbon footprint of the teams' flights to Australia and New Zealand by donating to \"climate resilience and carbon offsetting initiatives\" organised by the World Wildlife Fund and DanChurchAid. Having donated to offset carbon emissions every time her team required flights for five years before the 2023 Women's World Cup, Junge Pedersen decided to reach out to her national and club teammates to do the same when faced with the long flights to Australia and New Zealand and the prominence of the tournament. Announcing the initiative, she hoped other players would join them in donating before and during the World Cup. She and Canada's Jessie Fleming discussed their hope to leave a positive environmental impact, acknowledging that the donations were short-term fixes for one issue, and their hope that there will be more climate-positive developments in football.\nThe group of players also petitioned football governing bodies to make carbon concerns a more important factor in the bidding processes for future tournaments. The initiative was considered the biggest player-led climate campaign in football, especially with the 44 players coming from a variety of nations and working together. The player donations were also matched by a third party.\nGermany grassroots.\nAlso facilitated by Common Goal, the Germany team announced before their opening match that they would donate 1% of their FIFA-guaranteed earnings from the tournament to Futbalo Girls and Girl Power, grassroots football programmes for young girls and non-binary people.\nUN Women partnership.\nThe day before the tournament began, UN Women announced that it had partnered with FIFA for the Women's World Cup \"to celebrate the skills and achievements of the teams and players, to advance gender equality in football, and to prevent abuse and discrimination on and off the field.\" The initiative was also to highlight gender inequality issues during the tournament, with a joint campaign for everyone to recognise gender equality as a fundamental human right and to call for an end to violence against women and girls.\nIssues.\nControversies.\nThere were various controversies relating to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, with a main focus on players from a variety of teams going public about disputes with their respective football associations over various elements of professionalism, collective bargaining and development that they felt were not being met.\nThere were also controversies reacting to unpopular decisions made by FIFA: player welfare was a concern; the potential sponsorship of the tournament by Saudi Arabia was criticised and eventually dropped; the amount of money that the Big Five bid for broadcasting rights was criticised by FIFA, which in turn was lambasted for hypocrisy; and the inconsistency of the qualification system, in particular widespread condemnation by FIFPRO against confederations other than UEFA for failure to organise separate qualification campaigns unrelated to continental championships, was criticised.\nAfter FIFA experienced criticism for specifically banning OneLove captain's armbands hours before the 2022 Men's World Cup, it spent months in discussion with the women's teams to communicate on the matter. Both rainbow and OneLove armbands were banned at the Women's World Cup, with a similar FIFA-designed armband instead made available by the organisation.\nAfter Spain won the Women's World Cup, former Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) President Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed a Spanish footballer, Jenni Hermoso, and breached the Article 13 of FIFA Disciplinary Code. Rubiales was banned by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee from engaging in any football-related activities at both national and international level for three years.\nAuckland shootings.\nThe opening match of the Women's World Cup took place in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July; on the morning of the match, a gunman killed multiple people in the Auckland CBD. The fatal attack \"cast a shadow\" over the tournament. Football Australia said the shooting was not motivated by the World Cup. It took place near the hotel (M Social) where Norway, who played New Zealand in the opening match, were staying. The FIFA Fan Festival which was scheduled to take place nearby to the shooting location was cancelled, while the Italy team, who were also staying in a nearby hotel, could not leave to attend training due to police cordons. Moments of silence were observed on matchday one in respect to the victims of the shooting; security at and around Eden Park, the location of the opening match in Auckland, was heightened, with a statement saying this measure was taken for \"reassurance\". The players also wore black armbands and stadium flags were flown at half mast for both opening games. After New Zealand won the opening match in a surprise victory, Ali Riley paid tribute to the victims, saying that the team had \"wanted to bring something amazing\" in response to the shooting.\nAnother fatal shooting in the Auckland CBD, on the same street, occurred on 3 August; considered an unrelated and isolated incident, one person was killed and the perpetrator fled the scene after a fight broke out.\nPullman hotel fire.\nThe New Zealand team's base camp was at the Pullman Auckland Hotel &amp; Apartments. At 7:48pm on 22 July, the players and staff had to evacuate after fires broke out in multiple locations around the hotel due to a suspected arson attack; they were later allowed to return. Four people were treated for smoke inhalation, while Fire and Emergency New Zealand deemed the incident suspicious. New Zealand Football said that the fire was not connected to the shooting two days earlier. The security around the New Zealand team was increased, and a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and arson."

        "text": "The 2017 Royal Rumble was the 30th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on January 29, 2017, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. This was the second Royal Rumble to be held at this venue after the 1997 event, and the fourth to be held in the state of Texas, after the 1989, 1997, and 2007 events.\nTraditionally, the Royal Rumble match winner receives a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. However, due to the brand split that was reintroduced in July 2016, the winner received a match for their respective brand's world championship at WrestleMania 33, either Raw's WWE Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship. The main event was the 2017 Royal Rumble match, which was won by SmackDown's Randy Orton, who last eliminated Raw's Roman Reigns. This made Orton the seventh multiple Royal Rumble winner.\nSeven other matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. One of the more notable matches saw John Cena defeat AJ Styles to capture his record 13th WWE Championship and his 16th overall world championship, tying Ric Flair's official record. Also on the undercard, Kevin Owens retained the WWE Universal Championship against Roman Reigns in a no disqualification match, Charlotte Flair retained the Raw Women's Championship against Bayley, and Neville defeated Rich Swann to win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.\nIt was also the last time that only the men's Royal Rumble match took place as the women's Royal Rumble match was introduced the following year.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick event produced every January by WWE since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views (PPV), along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. Announced on September 30, 2016, the 2017 event was the 30th Royal Rumble and was scheduled to be held on January 29, 2017, at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, marking the second Royal Rumble to be held at this venue after the 1997 event, and the fourth to be held in the state of Texas, after the 1989, 1997, and 2007 events. It was the first Royal Rumble to occur under the second brand extension introduced in July 2016, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands, where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform, thus the 2017 event included wrestlers from both brands. In addition to airing on PPV, the event was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale on October 14 through Ticketmaster.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. As a result of the reintroduction of the brand extension, the winner of the 2017 Royal Rumble match earned a match for their brand's top championship at WrestleMania 33: Raw's WWE Universal Championship or SmackDown's WWE Championship. This made it the first Royal Rumble to feature the Universal Championship, following its introduction on Raw in July 2016 after the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown and was renamed to the WWE Championship. This was subsequently also the first time in which two world championships were eligible to be challenged for by the winner of the titular match since the 2013 event.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nAfter defeating Brock Lesnar at Survivor Series in his first match in 12 years, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match on the November 21, 2016, episode of \"Raw\".

Reigns and Rollins attacked both Owens and Jericho by performing Double Powerbombs on both men through broadcast tables. The next night on \"Raw\", Raw General Manager Mick Foley interrupted Jericho and Owens celebrating, announcing that Reigns would get a rematch against Owens for the Universal Championship at Royal Rumble, and Jericho would be suspended above the ring inside of a shark cage to ensure that he would not interfere in the match. Foley threatened that if Jericho does not enter the cage, he would be fired. Both were then put into a tag team match against Reigns and Rollins. The latter two won by disqualification after Braun Strowman came out and attacked them. The following week, Reigns retained the United States Championship against Owens after Rollins attacked an interfering Jericho. The following week, Reigns again retained the United States Championship, this time against Jericho. Owens was banned from ringside during the match as a result of losing to Rollins earlier that night. The following week, Reigns again defended the United States Title, this time in a handicap match against both Jericho and Owens. After Jericho and Owens double-teamed Reigns, Jericho scored the pinfall to become the United States Champion. The next week, after the opening segment involving Owens, Jericho, Reigns, Rollins, Strowman (who had faced Rollins in previous weeks), Sami Zayn (who attacked Strowman during his recent matches), and Brock Lesnar ended in a brawl, a six-man tag team match was scheduled for the main event, with Owens, Jericho, and Strowman winning against Reigns, Rollins, and Zayn. After the match, Owens powerbombed Reigns through a broadcast table. On the final \"Raw\" before Royal Rumble, Reigns faced Jericho in a rematch for the United States Championship, but Jericho was disqualified when Owens interfered, attacking Reigns. Owens and Jericho attempted to put Reigns in the shark cage, but Reigns retaliated and locked Owens in it, had it lifted above the ring, and then performed a \"Superman Punch\" and a spear on Jericho. Afterwards, it was announced that the match at Royal Rumble would be a no disqualification match.\nAt on December 4, 2016, AJ Styles retained the then-WWE World Championship against Dean Ambrose in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match.

On the December 20 episode, however, Baron Corbin confronted Ziggler, calling him undeserving of a title shot and stated that Ziggler only won because he was not there. The two then had a match with Ziggler's title shot on the line, but it ended in a double count-out. Styles then attacked both Ziggler and Corbin with a chair. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat for the WWE Championship between the three for the December 27 episode. That episode, John Cena returned from a near three-month hiatus and challenged the winner for the title at Royal Rumble. After Styles retained the WWE Championship, Cena came out, looking ready to fight, but instead congratulated him with a handshake.\nAt Roadblock: End of the Line, Charlotte Flair defeated Sasha Banks in overtime of a 30-minute Iron Man match to win her fourth Raw Women's Championship, as well as ending their long feud. On the following \"Raw\", Banks, in a knee brace and on a crutch, came to the ring to congratulate Flair but instead was attacked by Nia Jax. Later, Flair came out and declared herself to be the greatest female wrestler of all time, but Bayley interrupted Flair, reminding her that Bayley had beaten her twice on previous occasions. Bayley then pinned Flair in an impromptu non-title match. However, as replays showed that Flair had her shoulder up before the three count, Flair faced Bayley in another non-title match the following week, but this time with Dana Brooke as guest referee, who gave a fast three count to give Flair the victory. On the January 2, 2017, episode of \"Raw\", Bayley defeated Jax due to a distraction by Banks to become the number one contender for the Raw Women's Championship at Royal Rumble.

The next night on \"205 Live\", Neville and Kendrick defeated Perkins and Swann in a tag team match. The following \"Raw\", after Neville defeated Perkins, he challenged Swann to a match for the following \"205 Live\".

The following night on \"Raw\", Mick Foley congratulated Cesaro and Sheamus and presented them with a new set of championship belts. The New Day also congratulated them, but were interrupted by Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Big E and Kingston then teamed with Cesaro and Sheamus to defeat Gallows and Anderson and The Shining Stars (Primo and Epico). The following week, The New Day (Kingston and Xavier Woods) invoked their rematch clause for the titles, but were unsuccessful. Cesaro and Sheamus then began a rivalry with Gallows and Anderson.

A title rematch between the two teams with two referees was then scheduled for the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show.\nAt TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs, Alexa Bliss defeated Becky Lynch in a tables match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. Subsequently, Bliss avoided a rematch against Lynch but lost a non-title match against \"newcomer\" La Luchadora, who made the champion submit to the Dis-arm-her and then unmasked as Lynch. Over the next few weeks, an unknown villainess dressed as La Luchadora began to aid Bliss in matches against Lynch, including her successful title defense in a Steel Cage match in the main event of the January 17, 2017 episode of \"SmackDown\", where La Luchadora was unmasked as the returning Mickie James. The following week, James explained that she became forgotten due to the Women's Revolution; Lynch then came out, but was ambushed by Bliss. Nikki Bella and Natalya had entered a heated feud after Carmella had claimed that Natalya had attacked Bella at Survivor Series in order to take her place in her match. After denying the accusations at first, Natalya admitted to the attack on the December 20 episode of \"SmackDown\", revealing pent up jealousy of The Bella Twins, resulting in brawls between the two in the following weeks. One of these brawls, on the January 24 episode, resulted in a match between Natalya and Naomi being canceled. Naomi, left without an opponent, then issued an open challenge. Bliss came out, not to accept the challenge, but to insult Naomi. A six-woman tag team match was then scheduled for the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show, putting Lynch, Bella, and Naomi against Bliss, James, and Natalya.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Royal Rumble Kickoff pre-show, Becky Lynch, Nikki Bella, and Naomi faced SmackDown Women's Champion Alexa Bliss, Mickie James, and Natalya.

Outside the ring, Owens performed a frog splash on Reigns through a table and scored a nearfall. Jericho threw a pair of brass knuckles to Owens, which Owens used to perform a Superman Punch on Reigns for a nearfall. As Owens attempted a powerbomb through a chair, Reigns countered into a Samoan Drop through the chair on Owens for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman punch on Owens for a nearfall. Reigns attempted a Spear but Owens countered into a stunner on Reigns for a nearfall. Reigns performed a Superman punch on Owens, causing Owens to fall through chairs stacked outside the ring, which was followed by a powerbomb through an announce table to Owens.

Styles performed a Styles Clash on Cena for a nearfall. Cena performed a Super Attitude Adjustment on Styles for a nearfall. Cena attempted another Attitude Adjustment, but Styles countered and performed a Styles Clash. Instead of attempting a pin on Cena, Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm, but Cena countered into a third Attitude Adjustment, which was immediately followed by a fourth Attitude Adjustment on Styles to win the title for his record thirteenth WWE Championship. With this win, Cena tied Ric Flair's record of 16 recognized world championship reigns. However, the authenticity of this supposed record-tying has been called into question. Dave Meltzer has stated that Flair is at minimum a 19-time world champion, writing \"to me, the debate on Flair is whether he's a 19-time champion or a 20-time champion, but you can very much argue any number from 19 minimum to 23 maximum. In this day and age where the Internet is full of this information, it's kind of hard to cling to the 16 number, although \"16\" is the WWE mythology and it's hard to change from something they've pushed for so long.\"\nMain event.\nThe main event was the traditional 30-man Royal Rumble match with the winner earning a world championship match at WrestleMania 33. Big Cass and Chris Jericho began the match as the first and second entrants, respectively.

Goldberg entered as the twenty-eighth entrant, quickly eliminated Lesnar after delivering a spear, and then eliminated Rusev and Harper. The Undertaker entered as the twenty-ninth entrant, eliminating Baron Corbin, Goldberg, The Miz, and Sami Zayn, however, he was eliminated by Roman Reigns, the thirtieth entrant.\nJericho, Wyatt, Orton, and Reigns were the final four.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Frederick the Great on Unter den Linden avenue in Berlin's Mitte district commemorates King Frederick II of Prussia. Created from 1839 to 1851 by Christian Daniel Rauch, it is a masterpiece of the Berlin school of sculpture, marking the transition from neoclassicism to realism. The bronze statue shows \"The Old Fritz\" dressed in military uniform, ermine coat and tricorne hat on horseback above the leading generals, statesmen, artists and scientist of his time. Walled in during World War II, it was disassembled by East Germany in 1950, reassembled in Sanssouci Park in 1963, and returned to its original location in 1980.\nHistory.\nPrussian King Frederick William III commissioned the monument from sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch in 1839. It was cast beginning in 1845 by Karl Ludwig Friebel, whom Rauch brought from Lauchhammer for the purpose; changes to the figures on the base extended work to six years, and the monument was unveiled on 31 May 1851. It is one of Rauch's best known works, and influenced other monuments erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \nThe equestrian statue influenced many other monuments and is a registered monument of the City of Berlin. Beneath the equestrian statue itself, the unusually large plinth includes reliefs of the four cardinal virtues and important scenes from Frederick's life, and depictions, many in full relief, of 74 notable men from his reign; bronze plaques beneath the bands of sculpture list military men, philosophers, mathematicians, poets, statesmen, engineers, and others important in Prussia's emergence as a great power in the mid-18th century.\nDuring World War II, the monument was encased in concrete for protection. In May 1950, the East German \"Magistrat\" decided to remove it to the park at the palace of Sanssouci in Potsdam. Metal thieves damaged it after the protective casing was removed, and it was dismantled and taken away between 13 and 19 July. After being stored in pieces and at one point almost melted down, by 1962 the monument had been re-erected in the hippodrome at Charlottenhof Palace.\nIn the 1980s, the East German government changed its politics of memory and especially its position on the Prussian heritage. In 1980 Erich Honecker called Frederick \"the Great\" in an interview with Robert Maxwell; in the same year, the historian published a relatively positive biography of the king. The statue was restored and returned to Unter den Linden, approximately east of its old position. West Germany saw a similar return of a more positive view on Prussia with the Berlin exhibition \"Preußen – Versuch einer Bilanz\" (Prussia, an attempt at a complete picture). The preparations to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin in 1987 led to further reconsideration of the Prussian heritage; that year Gisela May performed a song celebrating the statue's return.\nAfter German reunification, the Senate of Berlin had the monument scientifically restored, and it was replaced in its original position, with the wrought-iron fence and 19th-century lamp posts recreated. After having paint thrown at it during a protest against the Bundeswehr, it was restored once more in 2006 and given a coating of wax to protect against graffiti.\nDescription and location.\nThe monument is tall, with the equestrian statue itself standing high. It depicts Frederick in military uniform and an ermine-trimmed cloak, wearing his decorations, and with his characteristic bicorne hat; he holds the reins in his left hand and in his right has a walking stick. The statue is mounted on an unusually tall plinth, high, bearing two bands of additional sculpture above a band of inscriptions: the upper section shows scenes from the king's life, with the four cardinal virtues at the corners, while the middle depicts 74 great men of Frederick the Great's time in life size, many in full relief.\nThe statue stands at the east end of Unter den Linden, facing east at the west end of the former Forum Fridericianum (now Bebelplatz) towards the site of the royal palace. It is enclosed by a low wrought-iron fence, which was recreated when the monument was restored and replaced in its original position.\nUpper band.\nThe upper sculpted band, immediately below the statue of the king, shows in bas-relief scenes from his life and is garnished at the corners with emblems of the four cardinal virtues in full relief.\nMiddle band.\nThe middle band depicts 74 men of Frederick the Great's time in life-size; some, such as the figure of his brother August, are free-standing; others are depicted in high relief. A few, including James Keith, are in bas-relief. As with the upper band, four figures in full relief stand at the corners, this time on horseback: Frederick's brother, Prince Henry of Prussia; Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel; Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz; and Hans Joachim von Zieten.\nBetween the mounted figures stand 25 of the key men of Frederick's career. Some of them are full-sized free-standing figures and several are carved in partial relief. The figures represented are predominantly military, but also include civilians of note, including diplomats, the Prime Minister of Prussia, jurists, poets, artists, and philosophers.\n&lt;br&gt;\nLower band.\nThe lowest band lists names of additional key figures from Frederick's reign, pressed in bronze.\nSouth face.\nThe south face displays bronze plaques with the names of 25 generals.\nNorth face.\nThe north face contains the names of 32 key military figures in Frederick's life. Thirty-two are generals; three are men who contributed significantly to various battles but because of early deaths did not reach the highest military rank.\nWest face.\nThe west face includes 14 men who contributed to the Prussian state as diplomats, authors, jurists, architects, painters and poets.\nEast face.\nThe east face bears the names of Frederick the Great, Frederick William III, and Frederick William IV, along with the dates on which the monument was commissioned and completed.\nOther statues of Frederick the Great.\nJohann Gottfried Schadow, who was Rauch's teacher and had received many commissions under the previous king, Frederick William II, had expected to carry out this commission. He had already in 1821–22 made a lifesize bronze of Frederick the Great with two greyhounds, which is at Sanssouci. He also created a marble statue of Frederick for the city of Stettin, now lost, a bronze reproduction of which is now in the grounds outside the New Wing at Charlottenburg Palace.\nIn 1865 two students of Rauch's, Aloisio Lazzerini and Carlo Baratta, made an approximately half-size copy in marble of Rauch's equestrian statue, which is in the park at Sanssouci.\nAnother smaller copy of Rauch's statue was made to commemorate Frederick's overnight stay in the Dehlitz section of Lützen before the Battle of Rossbach in 1757, and stood in a park there from 1858 until World War II, when it was moved for safekeeping to Lützen Castle."

He also had a career as a writer, beginning as a novelist of modest success before devoting his energies to cricket books. After the Second World War he completed a first-class honours degree in English from the University of London, studying externally.\nHe had trouble getting his first cricket book, \"Batsman's Paradise: An Anatomy of Cricketomania\", published, until he sent it to Errol Holmes, the former Surrey captain, who recommended it to a publisher. His cricket books were \"marked by a genuine affection for the subject as well as a flowing style\".\nMason and his wife Peggie had two sons (one of whom, Nick, was a journalist for \"The Guardian\") and a daughter.\nProse style.\nMason was a master of the long sentence. Here, in \"Batsman's Paradise\", he describes in two sentences a rare appearance in higher company for the Surrey stalwart Tom Shepherd, in a Test trial at Lord's in 1927:\nThat he proceeded to engage with Leyland in a stand of over 200, driving beautifully and seeming never for a moment at a loss with the wiliest bowlers in the kingdom, never surprised me for a moment; that his innings of 90 or so was very correctly singled out as one of the gems of the match was entirely right and proper and to be expected. That the selectors would never do anything about it, or that he would never get his chance to appear in any other representative matches of any kind, was almost as inevitable a corollary; and Tom Shepherd from that time forth obediently and I do not doubt quite contentedly continued to bat and bowl at the Oval, where he was known and honoured and knew his way about."

        "text": "This article covers the period 1884 to present. Before the beginning of the Open era in April 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in established tennis tournaments, including the four Grand Slams. Wimbledon, the oldest of the majors, was founded in 1877, followed by the US Open in 1881, the French Open in 1891, and the Australian Open in 1905. Beginning in 1905 and continuing to the present day, all four majors have been played yearly, with the exception of the two World Wars, 1986 for the Australian Open, and 2020 for Wimbledon. The Australian Open is the first major of the year (January), followed by the French Open (May–June), Wimbledon (June–July), and US Open (August–September). \nThere was no prize money and players were compensated for travel expenses only. A player who wins all four current major tournaments in the same calendar year, as an individual or as part of a doubles team, is said to have achieved the \"Grand Slam\". If the player wins all four consecutively, but not in the same calendar year, it is called a \"Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam\". Winning all four at some point in a career, even if not consecutively, is referred to as a \"Career Grand Slam\". Winning the four majors and a gold medal in tennis at the Summer Olympics has been called a \"Golden Slam\" since 1988. Winning all four plus gold at some point in a career, even if not consecutively, is referred to as a \"Career Golden Slam\". Winning the Year-end Championship also having won a Golden Slam is referred to as a \"Super Slam\". Winning the four majors in all three disciplines a player is eligible for–singles, doubles, and mixed doubles–is considered winning a \"boxed set\" of Grand Slam titles. \nThe current Grand Slams are the four most prestigious tournaments in the world held every year, they are distinguished by participation from almost every top player and by their two-week duration, 128-player draw in women's singles. It's extremely rare for a player to win all four tournaments, \"the Grand Slam\", in one calendar year. This was only achieved three times since 1888 by Maureen Connolly, Margaret Court, and Steffi Graf, the latter of whom stands alone in winning the \"Golden Slam\". These are some of the important records since the start of women's tennis in 1884.

With the addition of Idaho to the conference for the 2014–15 season, expanding the number of teams from 11 to 12, the tournament expanded from seven teams to eight. As in previous years, qualifying is based on overall conference record. The number of teams that failed to qualify stayed at four. All tournament games were played at the site of the regular-season champion. The women's tournament ran this year with a Wednesday-Friday-Saturday format because Montana hosted both tournaments, having won the women's regular-season title outright and earned men's hosting rights by winning a tiebreaker with regular-season co-champion Eastern Washington. With the move to an 8-seed schedule, the Big Sky also chose to go with the regular 8-seed tournament most other conferences use.\nThe 2015 tournament was the last to be held at campus sites, and the last in which certain teams were excluded for poor performance. Starting with the 2015–16 season, the Big Sky men's and women's tournaments both expanded to include all conference members (barring NCAA sanctions or self-imposed postseason bans), and both tournaments will be held at a predetermined neutral site.

The 24 teams consisted of the sixteen highest ranked teams eliminated in the second round, and the eight teams that advanced from the play-off round of 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification which were contested by the remaining twelve teams eliminated in the second round.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the second round was held on 14 April 2015, at 17:00 MST (), at the JW Marriott Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nThe seeding was based on the FIFA World Rankings of April 2015 (shown in parentheses below). The 40 teams were seeded into five pots:\nEach group contained one team from each of the five pots. The fixtures of each group were automatically decided based on the respective pot of each team.\nAs the seeding order was based on the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to the draw, it differed from the order in the AFC entrant list, which was based on the FIFA World Rankings of January 2015. Among the six first round winners, three were seeded higher than pot 5 (India in pot 3, Timor-Leste and Bhutan in pot 4), on the basis of ranking points gained from the first round matches, while the other three (Yemen, Cambodia and Chinese Taipei) were seeded in pot 5.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\nIndonesia was also drawn into this group, but on 30 May 2015 the country's football association was suspended due to governmental interference, and on 3 June 2015 the team was disqualified and all matches involving it were cancelled.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of runner-up teams.\nTo determine the four best runner-up teams, the following criteria were used:\nAs a result of Indonesia being disqualified by FIFA suspension, Group F contained only four teams compared to five teams in all other groups. Therefore, the results against the fifth-placed team were not counted when determining the ranking of the runner-up teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of fourth-placed teams.\nTo determine the four best fourth-placed teams, the following criteria were used:\nAs a result of Indonesia being disqualified by FIFA suspension, Group F contained only four teams compared to five teams in all other groups. Therefore, the results against the fifth-placed team were not counted when determining the ranking of the fourth-placed teams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

This match was played for 25 guineas a side and \"some thousands of persons of both sexes were present on this occasion\".\nA team called Kingston and Moulsey played two matches in July 1739 against London, winning both times, the second by the close margin of three runs. In July 1743, a combined Kingston and Richmond side played two matches against London and lost them both. In 1745, Kingston played Lambeth at Kennington Common on Wednesday, 24 July, and London at the Artillery Ground on Wednesday, 7 August. Neither result is known.\nThe next mention is in 1751 when a combined Kingston and Hampton team played Richmond at Moulsey Hurst on Wednesday, 4 September, but no other details are known. Kingston and Hampton played each other at Hampton Court Green on Thursday, 10 July 1755, Hampton winning by 3 wickets. The final mention of Kingston is on Wednesday, 23 September 1767 when they defeated Richmond by 2 wickets at Richmond Green.\nKingston Cricket Club is unrecorded after 1767. It may have disbanded in the later part of the 18th century and there is no modern equivalent. The nearest club to Kingston is Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club in Bushy Park. This club was established in 1863 and is currently a member of the Surrey Championship in the ECB Premier Leagues."

        "title": "2011 Indiana vs. Kentucky men's basketball game",
        "text": "The 2011 Indiana vs. Kentucky men's basketball game was a college basketball game between the Hoosiers of Indiana University Bloomington and Wildcats of the University of Kentucky who was ranked number 1 in the nation. A rivalry game between the two schools, this game was held at Assembly Hall on Indiana's campus. In an upset victory that was considered a turning point for the Hoosiers program, unranked Indiana defeated top-ranked Kentucky 73–72 on a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Christian Watford, which was nicknamed the \"Watshot\".\nBackground.\nIndiana.\nIndiana entered this game with an 8–0 record and had earned 4 points in the most recent AP Poll (released on December 5), enough for 39th place of all schools receiving votes. In the Coaches Poll released the same day, Indiana earned 23 points, sufficient for 31st place in the poll. In his fourth season at Indiana, head coach Tom Crean was hired in April 2008 after previous head coach Kelvin Sampson resigned due to recruiting violations. Crean's first season in 2008–09 was the worst in school history, ending with a 6–25 record. Indiana improved to 10–21 in the 2009–10 season, and then to 12–20 in 2010–11.\nKentucky.\nLike Indiana, Kentucky entered this game with an 8–0 record. Kentucky was also ranked #1 in the AP and Coaches Polls. Head coach John Calipari was in his third season at Kentucky, having led Kentucky to the 2010 Elite Eight and 2011 Final Four in the previous two NCAA Tournaments. Kentucky also had a star-studded group of freshmen on its roster, consisting of four former 5-star recruits in Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marquis Teague, and Kyle Wiltjer.\nRivalry.\nIndiana and Kentucky have a basketball rivalry dating back to 1924. The rivalry series had been played annually since the 1969–70 season on a home-and-home basis. Kentucky had won the past three games in this series. For the 2011 game, students lined up as early as 10 hours before tipoff for tickets.\nGame summary.\nThe game had a total of 13 lead changes, and neither team could extend its lead by much throughout the game. Kentucky's largest lead was 6 with 8:17 to go in the first half; Indiana's largest lead was 10, at 63–53 with 15:56 left in the second half. Neither team could get ahead. However, Kentucky rallied to take a 69–68 lead with 2 minutes to play, and the lead would change three more times. Indiana's Christian Watford made a layup to put Indiana up 70–69 with 1:07 left, and then Kentucky's Marquis Teague followed that up with his own layup to give Kentucky a 71–70 lead.\nAfter Watford missed a jumper with 30 seconds left, Indiana's Cody Zeller fouled Kentucky's Anthony Davis with 19 seconds remaining. With Kentucky only in the bonus (it was Indiana's ninth 2nd-half foul), Davis missed the front end of the one-and-one free throw, and Indiana's Victor Oladipo rebounded. After an Indiana timeout, Kentucky's Doron Lamb stole the ball from Oladipo and was fouled with 5.6 seconds left. This foul put Kentucky in the double bonus; Lamb missed his first free throw attempt, but made the second to put Kentucky up 72–70. Watford inbounded the ball to Verdell Jones III, who drove the ball by a screen set by Zeller at half-court. Jones then passed the ball to Watford, who made a Darius Miller-contested three-pointer at the buzzer to win the game for Indiana, 73–72. Players, students, and fans immediately stormed the court.\nAftermath.\nImpact on Indiana basketball.\nWith this win, Indiana beat a #1 ranked team for the first time since beating Duke in the Sweet 16 round of the 2002 NCAA Tournament. It was also Indiana's first win over a #1 team at Assembly Hall since beating Michigan State on January 7, 2001.\nWatford's game-winning, buzzer-beating shot in this game has been compared to Keith Smart's game-winner that sealed Indiana's 1987 NCAA title. Josh Sanburn wrote for \"Time.com\":\nSanburn also characterized Watford's game-winner and the court-storming that followed as \"a collective and spontaneous surge of relief\" following the seasons after the firing of Bob Knight.\n\"College Magazine\" also credited this game as a reason behind a \"resurgence\" of Indiana Hoosiers basketball.\nRematch in 2012 NCAA Tournament.\nIndiana and Kentucky met again in the Sweet 16 round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament on March 23 in Atlanta. Kentucky won 102–90 and would eventually win their eighth NCAA championship.\nFuture of series.\nThis game remains the final regular season men's basketball matchup between Indiana and Kentucky, after Crean and Calipari could not reach an agreement on game venues. Indiana wanted to continue playing the series on a home-and-home basis rotating between the two schools' campuses, while Kentucky wanted to play on a neutral court at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The rivalry resumed after Calipari's announcement.\nBroadcasting.\nThe game was televised nationally on ESPN and carried on radio by both schools' radio networks, the Indiana Hoosier Sports Network and UK Sports Network. Nielsen ratings ranked this game the 23rd most-watched program of the week ending December 13, 2011, with 3.59 million viewers and a share of 2.3. \"SportsBusiness Daily\" ranked this game the third most-watched regular season college basketball game on cable for the 2011–12 season."

The racewalking and marathon events were held on the temporary circuits around the Ontario Place West Channel. The sport of athletics is split into distinct sets of events: track and field events, road running events, and racewalking events.\nMirroring the Olympic athletics program, both men and women had very similar schedules of events. Men competed in 24 events and women in 23, as their schedule lacks the 50 km race walk. In addition, both the men's 110 m hurdles and decathlon are reflected in the women's schedule by the 100 m hurdles and heptathlon, respectively.\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for the athletics competitions:\nParticipating nations.\nAll 41 participating countries have qualified athletes. The number of athletes a nation has entered is in parentheses beside the name of the country. \nQualification.\nA total of 680 athletes will qualify to compete at the games. A nation may enter a maximum of two athletes per event, granted they meet the qualification standard. Qualification times and standards can be set from January 1, 2014, to June 28, 2015. The winner of each event contested at the 2014 Pan American Sports Festival will also qualify. Furthermore, a total of sixteen relay teams per event will qualify as well."

However, on 24 September 2014, it was announced this would instead be a three-team play-off, with the highest placed non-qualifying team taking part.\nTo accommodate the longer season in the French Top 14, the format was announced as follows:\nGloucester became the first team to qualify for the play-off, taking the place allocated to the Premiership, when they beat Edinburgh 19–13 in the Challenge Cup final on 1 May 2015. This result meant that the 7th place team in the 2014–15 Premiership will no longer take part in the play-off, and will compete in the Challenge Cup. Connacht qualified next, when the finished seventh in the 2014–15 Pro12 with 50 points, narrowly edging Edinburgh who had 48 points. Bordeaux Bègles qualified for the play-off on 23 May 2015.\nConnacht played Gloucester away at Gloucester's Kingsholm Stadium on Sunday 24 May 2015, with the venue having been decided earlier by a coin toss. It was decided that, in the event of a Gloucester win, the second play-off match would be played at Sixways Stadium in Worcester, to avoid a clash of fixtures with a Madness concert."

The son of former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Michael Young, he played college basketball with the Houston Cougars and later the Oregon Ducks. Young earned third-team All-American honors and was named conference player of the year in the Pac-12 as a senior with Oregon in 2015. He was selected by the Indiana Pacers in the second round of the 2015 NBA draft with the 43rd overall pick.\nHigh school career.\nYoung attended Yates High School under Greg Wise, where he averaged 27.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.4 steals and 3.8 assists per game as a senior to help lead the Lions to a perfect 34-0 record and the No. 1 national ranking in final polls from USA Today, MaxPreps and Rivals.com. In the process, he was named to the Parade All-America Third-Team, the Texas Gatorade Boys’ Basketball Player of the Year and the Class 4A Texas Association of Basketball Coaches All-State Team. Yates ended up winning their second straight State Championship with Young winning the Most Valuable Player of the state final award.\nCollege career.\nYoung originally committed to Providence, but was forced to sit out a season after fired head coach Keno Davis refused to release him from his letter of intent. He began his collegiate career at Houston, where his father was Director of Basketball Operations.

The club has played minor counties cricket since 1895 and played List A cricket from 1965 to 2003, using 11 home grounds during that time. Before the club was formed, an informal county team had played some matches, including six matches between 1820 and 1836 which were later given first-class cricket status.\nThe county's first home minor counties fixture in 1895 was against Cambridgeshire at the County Ground, Lakenham in Norwich. Their first home List A match came 74 years later against Yorkshire in the 1969 Gillette Cup at the same venue. The County Ground played host to the majority of Norfolk's home matches during the 20th century, before the club moved to Manor Park, Horsford at the beginning of the 21st century. That ground has been used almost exclusively for Norfolk's home matches since then.\nThe 11 grounds that Norfolk have used for home matches in List A or Minor Counties matches since 1876 are listed below. The club has played other matches at grounds in the county. Before the establishment of the Minor Counties Championship in 1895, matches against other county sides were played at Lakenham, at New Ground in Norwich and at the Norfolk County Ground in East Dereham.\nGrounds.\nBelow is a list of grounds used by Norfolk County Cricket Club in List A and Minor Counties cricket matches.

        "text": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Nottinghamshire, and also competes in major competitions in other formats of the game. Although there are records of a team competing as Nottinghamshire at an earlier date, the current club was established in 1841 and has competed in first-class cricket from 1841, List A cricket from 1963 and Twenty20 cricket from 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within or close to the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" away from the club's main headquarters has diminished since the 1980s. The Nottinghamshire team have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at nine different grounds, although of these only one has hosted Twenty20 games.\nThe current Nottinghamshire club's debut home game in first-class cricket was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. The ground had been laid out in the 1830s by William Clarke, captain of the All-England Eleven, who was married to the landlady of the Trent Bridge Inn. Trent Bridge also played host to the club's first home fixtures in the other formats of the game; in List A cricket in 1965 against Wiltshire; and in Twenty20 cricket against Lancashire in 2003. The ground has also been used for matches not including Nottinghamshire, including extensively by England.\nOther than a single match played in Newark-on-Trent in 1856 and two games played in Welbeck Abbey between 1901 and 1904, Trent Bridge was the home venue for all the county's first-class matches until the 1920s. In 1921 Nottinghamshire began to play at the Town Ground in Worksop, which was used for a single first-class match in most seasons until 1998, and also hosted three List A games between 1970 and 1980. From 1999 until 2014, the only ground used by the club other than Trent Bridge was the Sports Ground in Cleethorpes, which is not actually in Nottinghamshire but in the adjoining county of Lincolnshire. This ground hosted four first-class matches between 1980 and 1990, and five List A matches between 1983 and 2004. In 2015, Nottinghamshire played two List A matches at the John Fretwell Sporting Complex in Warsop, the first time they had played at a ground in their home county other than Trent Bridge for 17 years. The ground has continued to be used, and in 2019 hosted a first-class match for the first time.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Nottinghamshire CCC at the grounds since the establishment of the current county club in 1841 are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches, also known as limited overs or one-day matches, are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. Minor Counties North played a List A match at the Sports Ground in 1972. The match was against Nottinghamshire, but Minor Counties North were officially the home team. Only the List A matches played at the ground by Nottinghamshire in which they were the home team are included in the totals."

        "title": "2015 Pan American Games opening ceremony",
        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2015 Pan American Games took place on Friday July 10, 2015, beginning at 8:00 p.m. EDT at the Rogers Centre (Pan Am Dome) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The opening ceremony was produced and directed by Cirque du Soleil. The production was the largest event produced by the company ever, and cost approximately $30 million CAD to produce.\nAn audience of 45,000 were in attendance at the venue (sold-out crowd). There were 625 performers from 25 nationalities.\nThe tickets for the ceremony ranged between and . It was later announced in January 2015 that tickets to the ceremony were sold out.\nSynopsis.\nThe cultural segments of this opening ceremony were themed around the journey and aspirations of an athlete, from their dreams, to reality. The stage was an 85 x 85 diamond-shaped stage surrounded by four island 20 x 20 stages. Directly behind the stage were five spaced 22 x 40 Strong MDI screens hung side-by-side to form a 126 x 40 surface for video.\nThe Awakening of the Land.\nThe ceremony began with 20 performers representing the Four Ancestral Nations (and four seasons) of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region: Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation (four members move to the corners of the island, surrounding a shaman holding an eagle staff. They perform a ritual as an echo to the central indigenous concept of the four directions. It is autumn), Métis Nation of Ontario (a traditional scene where two men return from a fur hunt in a canoe, with snow and fog in the background. Three women welcome them with a celebration dance. It is winter), Six Nations of the Grand River (they enact the sky woman creation story. It is spring) and Huron-Wendat Nation (three women are growing food, two men give them shell necklaces and surrounding them is a wheat field. It is summer). Each ancestral nation was set on one of the four islands, which symbolizes the four directions. The stadium represented a womb, where tradition says indigenous people learn drumming from their mother's heartbeats. These drumbeats announce the arrival of the eagle.\nThe Countdown.\nThe eagle must take human form to impart its vision. The metamorphosis is completed in a precipitous plunge from the heavens, and the Messenger stands ready to channel the mystical conversion of dreams into reality. This scene symbolized the arrival of a character known as \"The Messenger\", and each countdown number had a meaning. Each number was highlighted by fireworks on the islands, with numbers between 2 and 0 being from the bridge.\nPowWow! Carnival.\nThis was a dance segment reflecting Toronto's multiculturalism and the aboriginal peoples of the Golden Horseshoe region, set to music by DJ Shub (formerly of electronic music group A Tribe Called Red). and also included 183 dancers representing various cultures (such as Hawaii, Brazil, Ukraine, Madagascar and Thailand among others) and 21 dance groups.\nThe Vision.\nIn a pre-recorded segment, the Pan-American Games Torch was relayed to the stadium through Toronto neighbourhoods by Canada's gold-medal winning 4 × 100 m relay team from the 1996 Summer Olympics, culminating with a scene depicting Bruny Surin passing the flame to Donovan Bailey on the CN Tower's EdgeWalk, and then parachuting onto the stadium roof. Bailey was then lowered into the stadium with the torch, and passed it to future athlete, diver Faith Zacharias, who placed the torch on a stand to serve as a focal point for the remainder of the ceremony. The dance groups then broke out into the dance again and exited the stage as one. Following this the president of the Pan American Sports Organization, Julio Maglione and Governor General David Johnston were introduced and entered the box of honour officially.\nRaising of the Canadian flag &amp; playing of the national anthem.\nThe Canadian flag was carried by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Canadian national anthem \"O Canada\" was performed by Véronic DiCaire and Chilly Gonzales, accompanied by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (nearly 80 musicians). They were directed by Peter Oundjian.\nParade of nations.\nAs each nation entered, the music reflected the traditional instruments and melodic styles of each of the forty-one countries and territories. Silhouettes portraying the five disciplines of the pentathlon appear in the distance to honour their entrance (javelin, long jump, wrestling, discus and running), where the first multi sport games and the Pan American Games grew from their foundations. Each nation was preceded by a placard bearer holding a high-tech LED Device which flashed the name of each participating team in the three languages (Spanish and English), official languages of the Pan American Sports Organization, along with French, the second official language of Canada after English.\nEntrance of the Heralds.\nSixteen acrobats and one hundred athlete marshals took part in this segment. This segment paid homage to the history of Canada's communication. The heralds represent our continued search for new ways to breach our communication divide. The ear, mouth and nose logos worn by them are all about the technology that helped build Canada at a time when the population was small and obstacles were huge. They invited the crowd to cheer for the volunteers and staff involved in the organization of the games while parading under the United We Play! banner (the official games motto. It was also written in French (Jouons Unis!) and Spanish (¡Unidos Jugamos!)). They light up LED lights on the athletes shoulders. These lights were designed to make them a part of the show using technology called PixMob.\nThe Birth of the Twin Fires.\nThe Messenger returns to the stage and reveals the Twin Fires that the Pan American Games flame shelters: The Fire of Dreams and the Fire of Reality. Together they represented the hopes and achievements of each human and every career in sport: trials and achievement, disappointments and progress, failures and victories. We are then taken into other worlds where mysteries await in pristine woods and the blaze of flames. The Messenger transforms the symbols of pentathlon into five powerful guardians for each discipline. The creation of Twin Fires is essential as it symbolized the window that opens between dreams and reality for the duration of this opening ceremony show.\nForest Borealis.\nOne hundred fifty children and youth were selected to perform during this segment after auditions. Six aerial performers flying up to high were also included in this segment. The Messenger created a primordial forest, which represents Canada. In this homage to what will eventually become Canada, four local animals (bear, caribou, woodpecker and owl), guided these one hundred fifty children along the trails of discovery, under the glow of the Aurora Borealis. Thirty-one young ballet dancers (from Canada's National Ballet School) later emerge from the group of children and perform down the stage.\nThe Fireline.\nFifty-three hip hop dancers, eight tumblers (who jumped over the fire onto mats), one aerial clay juggler, two fire manipulators, and one ballet dancer (javelin) took part in this segment. The fireline used in this segment was long. With childhood over the Guardian of the Javelin creates a border. The age of innocence is now over and now the first test in left: overcoming obstacles. To resolve their differences, they turn to lacrosse, Canada's national summer sport and the traditional Indigenous people's peacemaker. Eventually the fire is extinguished by a water bomber (a Canadian invention).\nWaves.\nThis segment sees the heralds from earlier paying their respects to Canadian Broadcasting pioneer Reginald Fessenden. Using radio waves and a jukebox a melody of Canadian love songs are played to the crowd along with two other songs (a famous song of Cirque du Soleil and the official song of the Games).\nHearts of bloom.\nThis segment saw 40 dancers and 7 aerialists. This segment represented the changing season, and the Guardian of the Long Jump performs aerial contortions up to 40 feet in the air. This segment represents the biggest leap in adolescent life, the discovery of love. A diameter mountain made of fabric panels to look like snow that melts into spring (to represent the changing seasons). Suddenly three straps are released and out of nowhere appeared three pairs (a man and woman, two men and two women) to represent the diversity of recognized forms of love in Canada. The dancers were from the Toronto Dance Theatre and Canada's National Ballet School.\nStorm of Possibilities.\n15 dancers, 6 acrobats (who perform on 30 feet high ladders), 1 hand balancer and the Guardian of wrestling (who is a capoeira dancer and acrobat) were in this segment. This segment represents the doubt humans face in life. The Guardian leads young adults into his own inner struggle. They drew on the courage and find the self-confidence to make the right choice as the sky is raining professions (costumes of a range of opportunities in Canada rain down) and exposing a world of opportunities. Canadian choreographer Christopher House directed the dance portion of this segment.\nTrain for life.\nThe train represented the railroad that stretches Canada and touches all territories and people (and uniting them). This is the moment when young adults leave home to forge their own paths. The Heralds build the station of farewells and track to our dreams. The railway also represents the journey of all athletes who left home that led them to the ceremony. The railway was built using the ladders from the previous segment. A train appears and the dancers run to jump abroad.\nTrailblazing.\nThis segment features the guardian of the discus (who is a freestyle frisbee champion), 3 aerial bungee artists, 19 dancers (two of which have disabilities), 10 BMX and mountain bike riders and 2 flatlands (the BMX solos on the main stage). The BMX and mountain bike tracks are long and composed of 9 modules up to 6 feet high, and total of 16 jumps. After leaving home the young athletes are blazing a trail for themselves. The Guardian of the discus is here to give them direction and he is here to hep them connect to their individual destinies and inspire them. This scene also included freestyle Frisbee, bungees, B-boy dancers, urban dancers and flatland BMX bikes.\nThe Moment of truth.\nThis segment saw the entrance of the Olympic and PASO flags. The PASO flag was carried by two time Olympic gold medalist speed skater, Catriona Le May Doan, CEO of Amanda's Lemonade Stand, Amanda Belzowski, Canada's man in motion Rick Hansen, two time Olympic medalist in triathlon, Simon Whitfield, author Jewel Kats, sporting excellence and community leader Pinball Clemons, advocate for refugees Loly Rico and Canada's most celebrated baseball player Fergie Jenkins.\nThe Olympic Flag was carried by author of Life of Pi: Yann Martel, the most decorated Canadian athlete in history Chantal Petitclerc, astronaut Chris Hadfield, Canadian hockey legend Bobby Orr, co-founder of the Aboriginal Professional Association of Canada, Gabrielle Scrimshaw, social activist Craig Kielburger, three time Olympic rowing champion Marnie McBean and six time Stanley Cup winner Mark Messier.\nAfter this the PASO anthem (instrumental) is played, while both flags are rose. This was followed by the athlete's oath taken by multiple Olympic medalist in trampoline Karen Cockburn and the judges oath taken by Stephan Duchesne.\nFollowing this was the speeches by CEO of TO2015, Saad Rafi and the president of PASO Julio Maglione. In between the two speeches was a tribute to the former president of PASO (by PASO Athlete's commission head Alexandra Orlando) Mario Vazquez Raña, who died earlier in the year. After the speeches were done, Governor General David Johnston officially opened the games.\nBuilding the Communities Cauldron.\nThe flags of Ontario (carried by the Ontario Provincial Police) and Toronto (carried by Toronto Police, Toronto Paramedic Services, and Toronto Fire), followed by representatives of the Boys and Girls Club of Canada (from the Braeburn community in the underprivileged part of the city, Rexdale) enter the stadium and are raised. The Cauldron is made of 66 panels (called petals), and 30 of them were assembled on the structure during the ceremony. The panels are each engraved with unique symbols designed by the 30 communities of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region.\nYonge Street.\nThe Guardian of running features in this segment, 9 towers high, 5 aerial treadmill runners and 120 dancers and acrobats feature in this segment. The heralds enter to reveal the final destination: Toronto. A city is born and a dream is realized when destinies of thousands of athletes converge. The five treadmill runners become the five guardians and they unite. The dancers mimic the grid of the city. The 30 community leaders also install their petals onto the cauldron while this segment was going on.\nLighting of the Pan American Games cauldron.\nYoung diver Faith Zacharias comes on stage again and lights a new torch, and she passed it onto the members of the silver medal women's 4 × 400 m relay winning team at the 1984 Summer Olympics (in order): Dana Wright, Charmaine Crooks, Jillian Richardson, Molly Killingbeck and Marita Payne-Wiggins. Wiggins then passes of the torch to her son, NBA basketball player Andrew Wiggins. Wiggins then runs up the bleachers of the stadium to the final torchbearer retired NBA Player Steve Nash. Nash then runs outside the stadium where he ignites a bowl, which transfers the fire to the official cauldron. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display shot off the CN Tower, and all the performers back on stage to celebrate."

        "title": "Super Bowl 50 halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl 50 halftime show took place on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara as part of Super Bowl 50. It was headlined by the British rock band Coldplay, who called Beyoncé, Gustavo Dudamel, Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, the University of California Marching Band and the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles as guest performers. The show attracted over 115.5 million viewers, making it the most watched halftime set in history by a group.\nMoreover, the band placed all of their studio albums inside the \"Billboard\" 200 chart after the concert, while Beyoncé became subject of controversy for performing \"Formation\", since she had aligned herself with the Black Lives Matter movement. Conservatives likewise accused Coldplay of promoting a \"gay agenda\". Despite its mixed reception from music critics on contemporary reviews, the show has been since ranked among the best in Super Bowl history by \"The Athletic\", \"Parade\", \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The Telegraph\".\nBackground.\nColdplay, Rihanna, and Katy Perry were considered as potential acts for the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show in 2015. Perry was soon confirmed as the headliner of the halftime show in November 2014. In summer 2015, many acts were being rumored as potential headliners for the 2016 halftime show including Taylor Swift, Britney Spears and One Direction. In September 2015, it was reported that Bruno Mars was set to curate the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, but the next month in October, It was reported that Maroon 5 was in talks to headline, but the band said they haven't had any conversations with the NFL about headlining, but were open to it. Maroon 5 would eventually headline Super Bowl LIII's halftime show. In late November 2015, reports surfaced stating that multiple acts would perform during the halftime show. Coldplay was confirmed as the lead halftime performer for Super Bowl 50 on December 3, 2015, one day before the release of their seventh studio album \"A Head Full of Dreams\". It was later confirmed that Beyoncé and Bruno Mars would join Coldplay as special guests. When Chris Martin originally called Mars to ask him to perform with Coldplay, Mars was wary of a multi-artist performance. The singer of Coldplay then invited Mars to his studio in Malibu where he was working. There, Martin revealed to Mars that he wanted for him to perform \"Uptown Funk\" with Beyoncé. Despite this, Mars remained skeptical and asked Martin to talk to Beyoncé to determine how she felt about the idea. Martin immediately texted a video of himself with Mars to Beyoncé, in which he asked her in the form of a song if she would come do the Super Bowl with both of them, to which she happily agreed. \nOne day before the performance, Mars and Beyoncé were \"watching playback backstage\" while Beyoncé ate a bag of Cheetos. Mars asked her, \"That's what you're doing?\" to which she replied, \"There's nothing more we can do these last two days. It's gonna be what it's gonna be. So I'm gonna enjoy this bag of Cheetos\". Mars admitted to learning a lot watching Beyoncé's preparation for the Super Bowl performance, saying that she is \"coming for you every single time, so you better bring your A-game every time\".\nPerformance.\nThe show opened with Chris Martin singing the opening chorus from \"Yellow\". He was then joined by the remaining band members of Coldplay to perform \"Viva la Vida\", \"Paradise\", and \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and the University of California Marching Band. Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, and a troupe of backing dancers (dressed in the styles of Michael Jackson) then performed \"Uptown Funk\". Beyoncé, also in a Michael Jackson-like bodysuit and appearing with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers, then performed her new single \"Formation\" in a mass choreographed dance and forming the letter X (to represent Malcolm X) before joining Mars onstage for a verse of \"Uptown Funk\". Coldplay played a snippet of \"Clocks\" transitioning into \"Fix You,\" and Martin sang along to some of the songs included in a video montage of past Super Bowl halftime and national anthem performances, containing show numbers by Bruce Springsteen, Missy Elliott, Katy Perry, The Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, James Brown, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, The Black Eyed Peas, U2, Prince, Beyoncé in 2013, and Mars in 2014. The show concluded with the band performing \"Up&amp;Up\" with Beyoncé, Mars, and everyone taking part in the show. At the end of the performance, the audience participated in a card stunt, creating a rainbow and the phrase \"Believe in Love\".\nReception.\nCritical response.\nThe performance received generally mixed reviews from critics, who complimented Beyoncé and Mars' part of the performance but were critical of Coldplay. Jon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" stated that Coldplay \"acted more as a stagehand than an actual performer\" while Beyoncé's section of the performance was \"the night's true event\". Caramanica also noted that Beyoncé and Mars \"outsang\" Martin during the closing part of the performance. Andrew Barker of \"Variety\" similarly noted that \"Coldplay seemed resigned to politely allowing themselves to be played right off their own stage\" by the \"far flashier\" Mars and Beyoncé. \nIn a review for Fox Sports, Chris Chase panned Coldplay's performance, calling it \"inexplicable, indecipherable, and unnecessary\" and a \"musical snooze\". Chase complimented Beyoncé's and Mars' appearances but described the performance as \"boring\". Alex Needham of \"The Guardian\" gave the performance four stars, saying that \"Queen Bey at the height of her powers effortlessly overwhelmed Coldplay's widescreen anthems in a show that seemed lightweight until she showed up\".\nRobert Bianco of \"USA Today\" stated that Martin \"seemed overwhelmed\" by the size of the event, and that despite being a \"personable and energetic performer\", an \"awful lot\" of Martin's energy \"went into jumping\". Bianco praised Beyoncé's appearance and stated that she \"stole the show\". Wendy Geller of Yahoo! also complimented Beyoncé's and Mars' appearances, but criticized the montage of previous halftime performances, describing it as \"confusing rather than touching\" and stating that the performance was \"definitely a cold play\".\nThe show received two nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special and Outstanding Variety Special (Live).\nIndustry peers.\nSeveral public figures in the entertainment industry commented positively on the show through social media, including Andy Cohen, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Ellen DeGeneres, Victoria Justice, Hoda Kotb, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Donnie Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon. Elizabeth Banks, Khloe Kardashian and Demi Lovato particularly praised Beyoncé and Mars, while Future published \"#Coldplay legendary forever\" on his Twitter account. Taylor Swift praised the \"Fix You\" montage with the previous halftime performances and mentioned feeling like she had dreamed the performance. Conversely, Piers Morgan panned both the show and its subsequent game.\nControversy.\nBeyoncé received criticism for the performance of \"Formation\", a song that right-wing politicians and activists considered to be \"anti-police\", and for appearing to align herself with the Black Lives Matter movement. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the show of being anti-police and also criticised Beyoncé's use of Black Power and Black Panther Party symbolism in her dance routine. \"This is football, not Hollywood, and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive,\" he said. The controversy caused a \"#BoycottBeyonce\" hashtag on Twitter and protesters announced plans for an \"anti-Beyoncé\" rally on the morning of February 16 outside of the NFL's headquarters in New York City, but no one showed up for such a rally. \nCNN political commentator Sally Kohn stated that \"too many police continue to show themselves to be far more interested in reactionary defensiveness and preserving the abusive status quo.\" Black Lives Matter activist and professor Melina Abdullah praised Beyoncé and other artists who \"are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice.\" In addressing her own controversy, Beyoncé explained, \"I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe. But let's be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice\".\nFurthermore, Coldplay were accused by conservatives of promoting a \"gay agenda\" at the end of the show, when rainbow-coloured placards were flipped to form the phrase \"Believe in Love\".\nCommercial reception.\nAccording to \"Billboard\", the halftime show got 115.5 million total viewers, becoming the most watched performance by a group. Moreover, all seven albums Coldplay had released at the time entered the United States albums chart; \"A Head Full of Dreams\" (2015) ranked the highest, at number four. The band also experienced a 174% surge in digital song sales, with the strongest seller being \"Adventure of a Lifetime\". \"Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans\" (2010) and \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" (2012), both from Bruno Mars, saw increases in sales as well. Despite not charting any albums, Beyoncé entered the Hot R&amp;B Songs ranking with \"Formation\" at number 18.\nSet list.\nCredits adapted from \"Billboard\"."

        "title": "United States women's national artistic gymnastics team",
        "text": " \nThe United States women's national artistic gymnastics team represents the United States in FIG international competitions. \nAs of 2023, the U.S. team is the reigning World team champion and the reigning Olympic team silver medalists, with the four gymnasts nicknamed the \"Fighting Four\".\nHistory.\nThe U.S. women won the team competition bronze medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Afterwards, they did not win another Summer Olympics or World Championships medal until the 1984 when the Olympic team won silver. During that competition, Mary Lou Retton also became the first American to win the individual all-around gold medal. The Americans started consistently winning Olympic and World team medals in the early 1990s with future Hall of Famers Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes. The 1996 Olympic team, known as the Magnificent Seven, was the first American team to win Olympic gold. An iconic moment in the sport's history came late in the competition, when an injured Kerri Strug stuck a vault to secure the title. After 1996, the team regressed for several years as their stars took breaks from competing.\nMárta Károlyi headed the program after the 2000 Olympics, ushering in an era of success for the U.S. team as they became one of the most dominant countries in women's gymnastics. The U.S. team has medalled in every Olympics and Worlds since 2000. They won their first World gold medal in 2003. At the 2004 Olympics, they won the team silver, and Carly Patterson became the second American gymnast to win the individual all-around. The U.S. team continued their success in the next quad. They won another Olympic silver medal in 2008. Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson were two of the best gymnasts of their era and finished first and second in the 2008 individual all-around.\nSince their second-place finish at the 2010 Worlds, the U.S. team has never lost an Olympic or World team competition. They won gold at the 2011 Worlds and then won gold at the 2012 Olympics by over five points. The 2012 team was nicknamed the Fierce Five and included Gabby Douglas, the first woman of color to win the Olympic individual all-around. In 2013, Simone Biles started her senior career and helped the U.S. team dominate the sport through 2016. In addition to the team gold medals, Biles won the individual all-around at the Worlds and Olympics for four straight years. The 2016 Olympic team, featuring Biles and veterans Douglas and Aly Raisman, was named the Final Five. They won the team competition by more than eight points.\nOlympic Games.\nThe USA Gymnastics women have won the Olympic Gold three times, in 1996, 2012, and 2016. These successes led to the nicknames Magnificent Seven, Fierce Five, and Final Five, respectively. They won four silvers in 1984, 2004, 2008, and 2020 and three bronzes in 1948, 1992 and 2000. The 2016 team name alluded to Márta Károlyi's final team to coach and that the team structure will be changed to four members beginning with the 2020 Olympic Games. The 1988 Olympic Games was the only year in which the team did not medal since its formation in 1982; they missed the bronze medal by one deduction. Six American women have won the Olympic individual all-around title, including five consecutive titles from 2004–20: Mary Lou Retton (1984), Carly Patterson (2004), Nastia Liukin (2008), Gabby Douglas (2012), Simone Biles (2016), and Sunisa Lee (2020). The most decorated American gymnasts at the Olympics, with seven medals apiece, are Shannon Miller (2 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze) and Simone Biles (4 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze).\nWorld Championships.\nThe United States women team is currently third in the all-time medal count for the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The first American gymnast to win a medal at the World Championships was Cathy Rigby who won silver on beam in 1970. The first female American gymnast to win a world title was Marcia Frederick in 1978 on the uneven bars. The most decorated American gymnast at the World Championships is Simone Biles, who won 25 medals (19 gold, 3 silver and 3 bronze) from 2013 to 2019. The United States won team gold in 2003, 2007, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2019. Additionally, eight American women have won the individual World all-around title: Kim Zmeskal (1991), Shannon Miller (1993-1994), Chellsie Memmel (2005), Shawn Johnson (2007), Bridget Sloan (2009), Jordyn Wieber (2011), Simone Biles (2013-2015, 2018-2019), and Morgan Hurd (2017). Biles is the only American gymnast to win both the Olympic and World all-around titles.\nCurrent roster.\nAs of April 3, 2024:\nTeam competition results.\nWorld Championships.\nNames in \"italics\" are alternates who received a team medal.\nJunior World Championships.\nNames in \"italics\" are alternates who received a team medal.\nMost decorated gymnasts.\nThis list includes all American female artistic gymnasts who have won at least four medals at the Olympic Games and the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships combined.\nHall of Famers.\nNine national team gymnasts, one national team coach, and one official have been inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame:"

        "text": "The 2015 Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team represented Vanderbilt University during the 2015 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Commodores played their home games at Hawkins Field as a member of the Southeastern Conference. They were led by head coach Tim Corbin, in his 13th season at Vanderbilt.\nPrevious season.\nIn 2014, the Commodores finished the season 3rd in the SEC's Eastern Division with a record of 47–19, 17–13 in conference play. They qualified for the 2014 Southeastern Conference baseball tournament and were eliminated in the second round. They qualified for the 2014 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, and were selected to host the Nashville Regional, which included Oregon, Clemson, and Xavier. The Commodores won their first three games of the regional, defeating Xavier by a score of 11–0, Oregon by a score of 7–2, and Oregon again, this time, 3–2, to advance to the Super Regional, of which they were hosts. In their first game against Stanford, the Commodores won 11–6, before dropping the second game, 4–5. In game three, Vanderbilt won, 12–5, to advance to the College World Series.\nIn the College World Series, Vanderbilt defeated Louisville and UC Irvine to advance to the semifinals and play Texas. In the first match-up with the Longhorns, the Commodores dropped their first game of the College World Series, losing 0–4. In the second game, the Commodores won 4–3 in ten innings, advancing to the College World Series finals to play Virginia.\nVanderbilt opened the finals against Virginia, the #3 national seed in the tournament, with a 9–8 victory. The Commodores proceeded to drop the second game, 2–7, before winning game three, 3–2. Vanderbilt were crowned national champions, their first championship in program history.\n2015 regular season.\nAfter a slow start, the Commodores easily qualified for the 2015 Southeastern Conference tournament, where they finished second to the Florida Gators. They then played host to the 2015 NCAA Nashville Regional, where they defeated Lipscomb University, The University of Indiana and Radford University, the last opponent by a record-tying shutout score of 21–0. The Commodores then faced the University of Illinois in the NCAA Superegional, defeating them in a two-game sweep and advancing to the College World Series.\nIn 65 games in his junior year for the team, Rhett Wiseman hit .318/.419/.566 with 66 runs (2nd in the Southeastern Conference), 39 walks (tied for 6th), and 14 home runs (tied for 6th). He was named an All-American.\n2015 NCAA College World Series.\nIn their opening-round game in the 2015 College World Series, Vanderbilt defeated , 4–3, on a walkoff home run in the bottom of the ninth in a game that had been suspended due to rain the night before, advancing into the winners' bracket. In their second-round game, Vanderbilt defeated the number 7 national seed TCU, 1–0. Zander Wiel hit a home run in the 7th inning to score the lone run of the game and break up a no-hitter.\nBehind an offensive outburst and dominating performance behind the arm of Walker Buehler, the Commodores beat TCU 7–1 to advance to their second straight College World Series Championship Series. Commodores outfielder Rhett Wiseman was hit in his neck by an 89 mph fastball while batting during the game, and was hit so hard it left a red mark that even showed the outlines of the baseball's laces on his neck. He stayed in the game (telling their coach \"it's the College World Series, baby. You're not taking me out of this game\"). Wiseman went on to hit a home run innings later.\nIn game 1 of the championship series Vanderbilt defeated Virginia 5–1 thanks to an outing by Carson Fulmer. Virginia held Vanderbilt scoreless (3–0) for just the second time all year, forcing a winner-take-all third game for the national championship. The Cavaliers beat Vanderbilt 4–2 to win their first baseball national championship in program history.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"\" | Regular season\n! style=\"\" | Post-season"

        "title": "Pitched delivery bowling",
        "text": "In cricket in the early 1760s, there was an evolutionary transition from the sport's \"pioneering phase\" to its \"pre-modern phase\" when bowlers began to bowl pitched deliveries by pitching the ball towards the wicket instead of rolling or skimming it along the ground as they had previously done. The essential bowling action was still underarm but the introduction of a ball travelling through the air coupled with a bounce was a key point of evolution in the sport's history, especially as it was the catalyst for the invention of the straight bat, which replaced the old \"hockey stick\" design. It was the first of three keypoint evolutions in bowling: the others were the introduction of the roundarm style in the 1820s and overarm in the 1860s.\nJohn Nyren's evidence.\nIn John Nyren's \"Memoranda\" (1832), he wrote the following account of the England v Kent match at the Artillery Ground in 1744:\nIt arose from a challenge given by Lord John Sackville on the part of the County of Kent to play all England; and it proved to be a well contested match as will appear from the manner in which the players kept the field. The hitting however could neither have been of a high character nor indeed safe, as may be gathered from the figure of the bat at that time; which was similar to an old-fashioned dinner knife, curved at the back and sweeping in the form of a volute at the front and end. With such a bat the system must have been all for hitting; it would be barely possible to block and when the practice of bowling length balls was introduced and which gave the bowler so great an advantage in the game it became necessary to change the form of the bat. It was therefore made strait in the pod (\"sic\"). Some years after this the fashion of the bat having been changed to a strait form the system of stopping and blocking was adopted.\nThis is effectively all that can be found in early sources about the introduction of the \"length ball\" and the consequent development of the \"strait\" bat. The evolution occurred after 1744 and before 1770. Given the rise of Hambledon from the mid-1760s, it is believed to have happened c.1760 during the Seven Years' War in which there was apparently a lull in top-class cricket, certainly in terms of known matches until after the war ended in early 1763.\nDifferent styles of play.\nWhereas roundarm and overarm were highly controversial and were introduced in the face of fierce opposition, there is nothing in the historical records which precisely dates the introduction of pitching and nothing which indicates that it was controversial. The two eras are bridged by the career (1749 to 1774) of John Frame, one of the game's first great fast bowlers, who played with pioneers like Thomas Waymark, Richard Newland and Robert Colchin at the beginning of his career and the likes of John Small and Lumpy Stevens at the end.\nAs described in History of cricket to 1725, early cricketers played in their everyday clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting by Francis Hayman of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white knee-length stockings and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes with the addition of a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground.\nWhen the ball was bowled along the ground, the batsman used his curved bat to attack it and try to hit it away, usually with the intention of lofting it over the fielders. There was, as such, no defensive technique other than the most rudimentary and instinctive attempt to stop a ball that had deceived him. The pitched delivery made the curved bat obsolete and the straight bat lent itself to the deployment of a defensive stroke. As the aim of the batsman with a curved bat was to hit the ball over the fielders, low scores were normal. If he did not time his shot correctly, the chances were high that he would miss the ball and be bowled or stumped; or else if he hit it poorly, he would not clear the fielder and be caught out. In addition, the pitches of the time were little more than rough tracks which were permanently exposed to the weather and so conditions were invariably to the bowler's advantage.\nInfluence of Hambledon.\nAlthough the Hambledon Club is widely and erroneously called the \"Cradle of Cricket\", it can at least, wrote F. S. Ashley-Cooper, \"claim to have been the centre in which the game was first brought to a certain degree of perfection and was developed in several respects to its lasting advantage\". In the first illustration of his book, Ashley-Cooper depicted a curved bat, labelling it: \"The type of bat used in the earlier Hambledon matches\". This indicates his belief that the straight bat was invented after Hambledon became a noted team. Ashley-Cooper believed that the club was founded in the early 1750s but it is possible that it was only a loose parish organisation at that time and that the club \"per se\" was not formally constituted until the 1760s. Certainly a team representing Hambledon played Dartford, one of the country's most accomplished teams, in 1756.\nIt seems, therefore, that the innovations of pitched delivery and straight bat were introduced just at the time when Hambledon came to the fore and so perhaps, as Ashley-Cooper suggested, Hambledon qualifies as the \"cradle\" of a new code of cricket. It has been suggested, certainly in speculation, that John Small invented the straight bat, though it may be more accurate to suggest that he was the first to master its use. With the transition from the pioneering era of cricket, Hambledon saw in a new \"pre-modern\" phase defined by underarm pitching which lasted until the introduction of roundarm bowling in the years following the Napoleonic Wars. It is not known who first bowled a pitched delivery, or when, or where, but it is likely that the style was developed primarily at Hambledon, although the leading bowler of the 1760s and 1770s, Lumpy Stevens, played for Chertsey and Surrey."

        "text": "The 2015–16 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Gonzaga University in the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by head coach Mark Few, who was in his 17th season as head coach. The team played its home games at McCarthey Athletic Center, which had a capacity of 6,000. The Bulldogs (also informally referred to as the Zags) played in their 36th season as a member of the West Coast Conference. They finished the season 28–8, 15–3 in WCC play to finish in a share for the WCC regular season championship. They defeated Portland, BYU, and Saint Mary's to be champions of the WCC tournament and earn the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As a #11 seed, they defeated Seton Hall and Utah to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Syracuse. The final AP Poll is the most recent poll in which Gonzaga was unranked until 2023–24, when they were unranked for 6 weeks.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2014–15 Gonzaga Bulldogs team were predicted to finish atop of the conference by the West Coast Conference Preseason Poll. The Zags finished in first place in the West Coast Conference Standings for the 18th time with a 17–1 conference record after BYU defeated the Zags in the regular season finale, snapping the nation's longest active home winning streak of 41 games, as well as Gonzaga's school record 22-game winning streak. The Bulldogs then went on to beat BYU in the West Coast Conference tournament, and claimed their 14th WCC tournament title, along with punching their 18th ticket to the NCAA tournament. Gonzaga entered the 2015 NCAA tournament as a #2 seed in the South region, and dismantled #15 seed North Dakota State, #7 seed Iowa, and #11 seed UCLA, to gain its second trip to the Elite Eight, as well as Mark Few's first as head coach.

        "title": "History of women's rowing",
        "text": "Women's rowing is the participation of women in the sport of rowing. Women row in all boat classes, from single scull to eights, across the same age ranges and standards as men, from junior amateur through university-level to elite athlete. Typically men and women compete in separate crews although mixed crews and mixed team events also take place. Coaching for women is similar to that for men.\nAt an international level, the first women's races were introduced at the 1951 European Rowing Championships as test events. After three successful tests, these became official championships as accredited by the International Rowing Federation (FISA) at the 1954 European Rowing Championships. Women's rowing was added to the Olympic Games programme in 1976 at a distance of 1000 metres. This was extended to 2000 metres from 1984 onwards at world championship level, and from 1988 at the Summer Olympics, consistent with men's rowing events at the Olympics.\nHistory.\nFor most of its history, rowing has been a male dominated sport. Although rowing's roots as a sport in the modern Olympics can be traced back to the original 1896 games in Athens, it was not until the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal that women were allowed to participate (at a distance of 1000 metres) – well after their fellow athletes in similar sports such as swimming, athletics, cycling, and canoeing. This increased the growth of women's rowing because it created the incentive for national rowing federations to support women's events. Rowing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London included six events for women compared with eight for men.\nDespite its male domination, women's competitive rowing can be traced back to the early 19th century, and an image of a women's double scull race made the cover of Harper's Weekly in 1870. Wellesley College in Massachusetts was the first school to organize a competitive rowing team for women in the late 19th century. The 19th Century English rower Ann Glanville achieved national celebrity becoming known as the champion female rower of the world; her all-women crew often winning against the best male teams. St Hugh's College, Oxford owned a boat for use by its women students as early as 1891; it was stored at the River Cherwell and students \"who can swim 50 feet\" were permitted to use it. In 1892, four young women started what became ZLAC Rowing Club in San Diego, California, which is thought today to be the world's oldest continuously existing all-women's rowing club. Newnham College Boat Club was formed the following year in Cambridge, England. In 1927, the first Women's Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge was held. For the first few years it was an exhibition, and it later became a race. Ernestine Bayer, called the \"Mother of Women's Rowing\", formed the Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club in 1938.\nFISA, under its Swiss president Gaston Mullegg, approved at its ordinary congress on 30 August 1950 that women's rowing event would be added to the European Rowing Championships. There was opposition to women's rowing from the Swiss and Italian rowing associations but the motion was passed. It was decided that the feasibility of holding women's event would be trialled first; in the same way, the introduction of lightweight and junior championships was trialled first before the events became fully accredited. It was also decided at the August 1950 congress that women would compete over a 1000 m distance, with no reasons recorded for this decision. The normal distance for men was 2000 m and the shorter distance for women would be kept until the 1984 World Rowing Championships when women's rowing changed to 2000 m. The 1984 Summer Olympics were the last Olympic Games that used the 1000 m distance.\nThe next FISA congress was held just prior to the 1951 European Rowing Championships where four countries had nominated women: Great Britain, France, Holland and Denmark. The congress decided that \"international regattas for women should be held each year under the auspices of FISA, if possible as part of the European championships, either on the day before them or after them, but on no account during the actual championships.\" Until the hiatus of the European Championships in 1973, the event for women was always held before the event for men, and in two years, the women's championships were held in different locations: in 1955 (when the men met in Ghent and the women met in Bucharest) and in 1963 (when the men met in Copenhagen and the women met in Moscow). There were no European Rowing Championships in 1952 as the men did not compete in Europe when the Summer Olympics were held in Europe that year, and the same four countries sent women to a regatta in Amsterdam. At the 1953 European Rowing Championships, the four initial countries were joined by Norway, Finland, Austria, West Germany, and Poland.\nBut even before the 1953 European Rowing Championships had been held, FISA decided at an extraordinary congress in May 1953 that the women's events would formally become part of the European Rowing Championships starting with the 1954 European Rowing Championships.\nIn 1988, the first Henley Women's Regatta was held. Henley Royal Regatta first included a women's singles event over the full course in 1993, followed in 2000 by eights (now Remenham Challenge Cup) and 2001 by quadruple sculls (now Princess Grace Challenge Cup). In 1997 one of the last bastions of rowing was breached when the Leander Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, voted to admit women as members. This rule met a condition imposed by UK Sport and qualified Leander to receive a £1.5 million grant for refurbishment from the Lottery Sports Fund. The club was opened to women in 1998 and appointed Olympic medallist, Debbie Flood, as its captain in 2012.\nAt the international level, women's rowing traditionally has been dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and New Zealand often field competitive teams.\nThe United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's collegiate rowing due to Title IX. Because Title IX mandates equal money spent on men's and women's sports, rowing is particularly useful due to the extremely high costs of equipment per athlete. Therefore, many schools open a rowing program only to women to financially counteract the prevalence of men's sports. As a result, many women's college rowers have not previously competed at high school or for a club team. In the United States, it is important to note that Women's Rowing is an NCAA sport, while Men's Rowing chooses to remain governed by its own regulatory body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA). The IRA, formed in 1895, preceded the NCAA by at least ten years and provided a guideline for the rules of eligibility and sportsmanship later adopted by the NCAA when it was formed."

        "text": "The Windsor Lancers men's ice hockey team is an active ice hockey program representing the Windsor Lancers athletic department of the University of Windsor. The team has been active since the early 1960s and is currently a member of the Ontario University Athletics conference under the authority of U Sports. The Lancers play at the Capri Pizzeria Recreation Complex in Windsor, Ontario.\nTeam history.\nHistory.\nThe Windsor Lancers men's hockey team began in the early 1960s as members of the \"Ontario Intercollegiate Athletics Association\" (as the Assumption College Lancers). The Lancers won their division in 1965, but lost the OIAA final to Laurentian University in a sudden-death 4–2 loss. In 1968, the Lancers were promoted to the QOAA. In 1971, the QOAA was dissolved and the Lancers joined the newly formed \"Ontario University Athletics Association\", now known as the OUA.\nThe Windsor Lancers men's hockey team is currently led by Head Coach Kevin Hamlin. Coach Hamlin has led the Lancers to tremendous success including the 2013–14 OUA Queen's Cup Championship and two straight CIS national championship tournament appearances.\nIn 2008–09, Hamlin's first season, he was named the OUA Men's Hockey Coach of the Year after leading the Lancers to a 15-point turnaround in the standings from the previous year. In 2010–11, Hamlin's Lancers finished the regular season with a 12–12–4 record as he led Windsor back into the playoffs for the second straight season. His second year behind the Lancer bench came in 2009–10 where led the Lancers back to the playoffs as they advanced to the OUA West Semi-finals. In 2011–12, he led the Lancers to their best season in over a decade as they finished 15–12–1 and advanced the Western Conference finals. Coach Hamlin's squad finished the year ranked #11 in the country. In 2012–13, Coach Hamlin's squad finished 18–9–1 and in second place in the OUA Western conference. The Lancers finished as one of the top scoring teams in the nation including 8th in Canada in goals and 6th in the CIS in power-play goals.\nIn 2013–14, Coach Hamlin led his squad to the Queen's Cup Ontario Championship for only the second time in school history. They also finished the season ranked #5 in Canada – the program's highest ever finish in the national rankings. Hamlin was honoured with both the Windsor Essex Sports (WESPY) Coach of the Year award and the Gino Fracas Coach of the Year award for his outstanding work behind the bench.\nEn route to winning the Queen's Cup, the Lancers enjoyed a tremendous playoff run that included playoff series wins over Toronto, Western, Lakehead and McGill to earn the title. At the CIS National Championship tournament, Windsor also earned their first ever victory at Nationals as they knocked off the A.U.S. champion Acadia Axemen 4–2 in pool play.\nIn 2014–15, Hamlin was named the Ontario University Men's Hockey Coach of the Year for the second time in his career and was a finalist for the CIS National Coach of the Year after leading the Lancers to a program best 22–4–1 record and first place overall in the OUA. The Lancers were ranked in the CIS top ten for 17 straight weeks and captured an Ontario bronze medal while earning their second consecutive trip to the CIS national championships. Individually, the team received tremendous recognition for their outstanding season. Senior forward Spencer Pommells, a native of Grande Prairie, Alta., became the first Lancer to claim the Joseph A. Sullivan Trophy as CIS player of the year and only the third Windsor player to capture a CIS major award in men's hockey. Forwards Chris Gignac (1999) and Ken Minello (1989) had previously merited the R.W. Pugh Award presented annually to the most sportsmanlike player. The senior forward racked up 50 points in 27 league games, including 16 goals and a CIS-leading 34 assists, to win the national scoring race by eight points and the OUA crown by 11. Of his team-leading 16 goals, five were game-winners, leaving him one short of the nation's lead. Kenny Bradford was named the OUA Defenseman of the year and a CIS All-Canadian after he led the CIS in scoring by a defenceman with 28 points, scoring eight goals and adding 20 assists. He was a key cog in the Lancers third-ranked power play, scoring six of his eight goals on the man advantage. Senior netminder Parker Van Buskirk was named the OUA goaltender of the year after he led the conference with 20 wins and made the second most starts of any goaltender with 24. His 2.86 goals against average was the second-best of any western conference goalie, and his .904 save percentage was sixth best overall. Dylan Denomme was named the OUA West rookie of the year as he finished second on the Lancers in points with 31, scoring 13 goals and 18 assists, while appearing in all 27 games. He led all CIS rookies in scoring and tied Bradford for the team lead with six power play goals as well.\nIn recent years the Lancer's have continued their winning ways. Led by USports goaltender of the year, Nathan Torchia, the 2022-23 Lancers had an incredible season. Finishing 2nd in the OUA west after the regular season. They earned a first round bye which led to them playing the Brock Badgers in the second round. They won this series in 2 games which meant they were onto the OUA West conference finals. Were they met the Lakehead Thunderwolves and this series was very tight and a 3rd and deciding game was needed. The Lancers ultimately won this game which punched their ticket to USports Men's Hockey National Championship's held in PEI and gave them rights to hosting the Queens Cup in Windsor. The Queens Cup was a hard fought game and needed 6 total periods to decide a winner. Unfortunately the Lancer's surrendered a goal early on in the 3rd overtime to the UQTR Patriot's. After a 2nd place finish in the OUA playoffs, this still meant the Lancer's were heading to PEI for the Usports Championships. Where they met the Alberta Golden Bears in the first round, winner takes all game. Unfortunately the game didn't go as planned and the Golden Bears came out to a scorching hot start scoring multiple goals early on. The Lancers were unable to battle back and lost. Overall it was an incredible season for them, going on such a terrific run and falling a goal post short of being Queens Cup champions. \nSeason-by-season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, SOL = Shootout Losses, Pts = Points\"\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The Australian cricket team is the most successful team in the Cricket World Cup winning the 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023 editions. This also makes them the only team to have won the world cup in all the regions (group of countries) that have hosted the world cup till now. Besides, Australia had reached the finals of the 1975 and 1996 World Cups losing to West Indies and Sri Lanka respectively. They were also reached semifinals of 2019 and quarterfinals of 2011 World Cups losing to England and India respectively. They were knocked out in first round three times in 1979, 1983 and 1992 editions. The team has played total 107 world cup matches, the highest of any team. Its overall win–loss record is 79-26 (which gives it the highest win percentage among all teams playing the world cup), with one tied match and two being abandoned due to rain.\nCricket World Cup Record.\nWhite: Group/Round-Robin Stage\nAustralia at 1975 Cricket World Cup.\nSummary\nThe 1975 Cricket World Cup was the first Cricket World Cup. It was held in England in June 1975 and consisted of two weeks of one-day matches played 60-overs-a-side. The format consisted of a group stage, in which each team played the other three teams in its group of four. The top two teams from both groups would progress to the semifinals. Australia was placed in group B along with Pakistan, West Indies and Sri Lanka. For this world cup, the Australian side was led by Ian Chappell. The ODI format of cricket at that time was new for most teams, and Australia was among more experienced one day cricket teams at that time, with a decent batting and bowling lineup. So they were considered among tournament favorites.\nAustralia first played Pakistan at Leeds, and as expected, won the match. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. All top order batsmen played well( Alan Turner, Rick McCosker, Ian Chappell and Greg Chappell). A quick 80 run off 94 balls of Ross Edwards took Australia to 278/7. Then a five wicket haul of Dennis Lillee helped Australia to bundle out Pakistan for 205. Australia then played non test playing Sri Lanka and were expected to easily win against the minnows. But though they won, their winning was not that one sided as expected. Once again Turner played well scoring a century (101 runs, 113 balls) and took Australia to a mammoth 328. But Sri Lanka's batsmen played well and despite Australia's strong bowling attack, were able to reach 276 in 60 overs. This match was also accompanied by lot of drama, as Sunil Wettimuny and Duleep Mendis got retired hurt off Dennis Lillee's and Jeff Thomson's deliveries, and were playing well. In fact, Sri Lanka could have won the match if they remained at the crease. With this win, Australia progressed to the semifinals. The last group match of Australia was with West Indies, the team who was dominating world cricket at that time. West Indies won the toss and elected to field first. Except of Ross Edwards and Rod Marsh, who showed resistance scoring half centuries, the rest of the Australian lineup struggled against West Indian bowling attack led by Andy Roberts and Keith Boyce, and Australia were all out for 192. None of the Australian bowlers could make an impact as West Indies chased down the target with ease. With this loss, Australia finished second in group B and had to face England in semifinals.\nAustralia won the toss and choose to field on a bowling friendly wicket. The Australians dominated the first innings, and with the help of Gary Gilmour who took six wickets, bundled out England for 93. However, they received a terrible setback in second innings as they were reduced to 39/6. From then on, Gilmour and Doug Walters played patiently and took Australia to an uncertain victory. With this win Australia entered the finals where they had to face a strong West Indies, who were the only team to which they had lost so far in the tournament.\nIn the finals Australia won the toss and elected to field. West Indian captain Clive Lloyd scored a century and enabled west Indies to reach 291/8. Among Australia only Gilmour bowled well, taking six wickets. In chasing, the Australian batsmen's running between the wickets turned out to be very poor, and five of them were run out. In fact, they never looked to chase the target, and eventually lost by 17 runs.\nAustralia at the 1979 World Cup.\nThe second edition of the Cricket World Cup was held in 1979 once again in England and with the same tournament format as in 1975. This time the Australian team for the world cup was almost entirely different from the 1975 Cricket World Cup, and was led by young batsmen Kim Hughes. The team was somewhat less experienced than previous squad, but still were expected to put a decent show. This time Australia was placed in Group A, along with England, Pakistan and associates Canada.\nAustralia began their campaign with a huge loss against tournament favourites England. Batting first, Australia were in a good situation, with Andrew Hilditch, Rick Darling and Allan Border taking Australia to 131/3. But after Border was dismissed, the middle order, consisting of Graham Yallop, Gary Cosier and Trevor Laughlin, collapsed in run outs. The tailenders were also easily taken over by English bowling, and Australia was bowled out for 159. Then a half century scored by Graham Gooch ensured England chasing the target without much hassle, reducing Australia's next two matches to must wins. Australia were then knocked out in next match against Pakistan. Pakistan, sent to bat first by Australia, scored 286/7 in 60 overs thanks to Majid Khan(61 runs, 107 balls) and skipper Asif Iqbal(61 runs, 75 balls), who received support from other batsmen as well. For Australia, Hilditch scored 72 and Yallop scored 37, but they received little support from other batsmen as they failed to withstand Majid Khan, Imran Khan and Sikander Bakht, who took 8 wickets in total. Eventually, Australia was bowled out for 197. Australia played for pride against Canada at Birmingham in their last group match. Australian bowler Alan Hurst(5/21) ripped through amateurish Canadian batting and bundled them out for 105. The score was easily chased down in 26 overs with the loss of 3 wickets. Despite this win, this tournament is considered as the worst ever world cup tournament for Australian team, as they lost to both test playing nations in their group in a completely one sided manner.\nAustralia at the 2003 World Cup.\nNote:Australia made three replacements in the squad – Ian Harvey replacing Shane Watson on 25 January 2003, Nathan Hauritz replacing Shane Warne on 24 February 2003, and Nathan Bracken replacing Jason Gillespie on 5 March 2003.\nAustralia at the 2023 World Cup.\nAustralia started its 2023 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup campaign with two successive defeats - in its opening match against India played on October 8, 2023 and also on its second group match against South Africa played on October 12, 2023. It however defeated Sri Lanka in its third group match of the 2023 cricket world cup played on October 16, 2023. In its 4th group match, Australia - helped by David Warner and Mitchell Marsh's record opening partnership of 259 runs, playing against Pakistan ended their innings with 367 runs in 50 overs losing 9 wickets. Australian bowlers later bowled out Pakistan for 305 runs, thus winning the match by 62 runs. While playing against Pakistan on October 20, 2023 in the 2023 World Cup Group Match at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, Warner and Marsh went past Brad Haddin and Shane Watson’s 183 against Canada at the same venue on March 16 in 2011 Cricket World Cup."

        "text": "The 2021 IHF World Men's Handball Championship was the 27th event hosted by the International Handball Federation and held in Egypt from 13 to 31 January 2021.\nStarting with this edition, the World Championship was expanded from 24 teams to 32. It was also the third World Championship hosted in Africa, the second in Egypt, and the first to be hosted outside of Europe since 2015.\nDenmark were the defending champions, having won their first World Championship title in 2019 on home soil. They defended the title by beating Sweden in the final, the second final between two Scandinavian countries in a row. On the way, Denmark defeated hosts Egypt in the quarter-finals, and the reigning European champions Spain in the semi-finals. The latter secured the bronze medal after defeating France in the third place game.\nThe tournament was played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBidding process.\nSeven nations initially expressed interest in hosting the tournament:\nHowever, until the bidding phase expired on 15 April 2015, only three nations entered documents to bid for the event:\nA decision was scheduled for 4 June 2015, but the Congress was moved to 6 November 2015, where Egypt was chosen as the host.\nFormat.\nThe 2021 edition saw a format change as the tournament was expanded. The 32 teams were split into eight groups of four teams each. The top three teams from each group progressed to the main round, while the teams ranked last in their preliminary round groups played the President's Cup. The 24 main round teams were divided into four groups of six teams each. The top two teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nVenues.\nFollowing is a list of all venues and host cities.\nQualification.\nAs is the previous edition, the World Championship organizer was directly qualified, along with the reigning world champions.\nFollowing the decision about increasing the number of participating teams, changes were made in the distribution of places by the Continental Confederations. The number of compulsory places awarded to each Continental Confederation was increased as follows: four places each for Africa, Asia, and Europe.\nStarting from this tournament, Pan America was split into two zones: the North America and Caribbean Zone with one compulsory place, and the South and Central America Zone with three places. There was also a South and Central American Men's Last Chance Qualification Tournament which provided a qualification spot for the winning team.\nOne additional place was available for Oceania, but only in the case where that national team would rank fifth or higher at the Asian Championship. Since no Oceania team placed among the top five at the Asian Championship, the IHF awarded an additional wild card.\nIn addition, there were 12 performance places for the Continental Confederations, which were based on the teams ranked 1–12 of the preceding World Championship.\nAccording to the new qualification system and taking into consideration the results of the 2019 Men's World Championship, 32 places were distributed as follows:\n1. Since countries from Oceania (Australia or New Zealand) participating in the Asian Championships did not finish within the top five, they did not qualify for the World Championship. Since they placed sixth or lower, the place transferred to the wild card spot.\n2. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the South and North American qualification tournaments were scrapped. The IHF Council decided to extend the deadline for the organisation of the remaining qualification tournaments until 31 October 2020.\n3. Because the European qualification was cancelled, the final ranking of the 2020 European Men's Handball Championship was used to determine the participants.\n4. On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation. The Russian team will play under the name \"Russian Handball Federation Team\".\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 5 September 2020 at the Giza Pyramids Plateau. As hosts, Egypt had the privilege to assign itself to a group.\nSeeding.\nOn 23 July 2020, the pots were announced.\nGroups.\nThis is the result of the draw with all groups\nReferees.\nThe referee pairs were selected on 4 January 2021.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+2).\"\nMain round.\nAll points obtained in the preliminary round against teams that advance as well, are carried over.\nFinal ranking and awards.\nFinal ranking.\nPlaces 1 to 4 and 25 to 32 were decided by play-off or knock-out. The losers of the quarter-finals were ranked 5th to 8th according to the places in the main round, points gained and goal difference. Teams finishing third in the main round were ranked 9th to 12th, teams finishing fourth in the main round were ranked 13th to 16th, teams finishing fifth in the main round were ranked 17th to 20th and teams ranked sixth were ranked 21st to 24th.

        "text": "The 2023 IHF World Men's Handball Championship was the 28th such event hosted by the International Handball Federation. It was held in Poland and Sweden from 11 to 29 January 2023.\nDenmark were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2019 and 2021 editions, and successfully defended their title by defeating France 34–29 in the final. In doing so, Denmark became the first men's national handball team to win three consecutive world titles. Spain beat the hosts and European champions Sweden to win a World Championship bronze medal for the third time, the second in consecutive editions.\nBidding process.\nEight nations initially expressed interest in hosting the tournament:\nHowever until the bidding phase expired on 15 April 2015 only three nations entered documents to bid for this event. On 21 April 2015 it was announced that Poland and Sweden had agreed intentions to jointly hosting this tournament:\nA decision was scheduled for 4 June 2015, but the Congress was moved to 6 November 2015. Poland and Sweden were chosen as the hosts. This is the first time Poland participate as the host country at a IHF World Men's Handball Championship.\nVenues.\nThe tournament took place in nine cities (four in Poland and five in Sweden): Kraków, Gdańsk, Katowice, Płock, Stockholm, Malmö, Gothenburg, Jönköping and Kristianstad. The opening game took place in Katowice while the final took place in Stockholm.\nMarketing.\nThe logo was unveiled on 23 August 2021. The logo was designed to be used on a dark blue background, but it may also stand alone. The logo synthetically presents a flying ball. It was inspired by a comet lighting up the sky. The symbol conveys dynamism and expression. The trails form a hand which, in combination with a ball in the foreground, create a characteristic and friendly graphic form. The logo's colors refer to the national colors of Poland and Sweden, the organizers of the Men's World Championship 2023. It carries a clear message about the sports discipline of handball. A skillful and well-balanced color split alludes to the cooperation of the event hosts and sticking together for the success of the Championship. The logo was designed by Polish design agency Studio Signature. The slogan: \"Stick Together\" was unveiled on 15 September 2021. The concept \"Stick together\" is the framework for all our communication and is the sender in all posts or other expressions coming from the 28th IHF Men's World Championship Poland/Sweden 2023. We use \"Stick together\" to talk about the big questions and the broader context, but we also use \"Stick together\" locally in all marketing in each host city. It symbolizes by each concept:\nIt is also as part of both countries sustainability and capable communication concepts.\nQualification.\nThe World Championship hosts qualified directly, along with the reigning world champions.\nFollowing the current IHF rules, the number of compulsory places awarded to each continental confederation is divided as follows: 4 places each for Africa, Asia and Europe. Because there is more than one organiser from the same Continental Confederation (Europe), the number of compulsory places of the respective Continental Confederation were reduced accordingly. So only 3 compulsory places for Europe, while Africa and Asia were kept with 4 four places allocated. Starting in 2021 Pan America was split into two zones: the North America and Caribbean zone having 1 place, and the South and Central America zone having 3 places.\nOne additional place were available for Oceania, but only when that region's national team ranked fifth or higher at the Asian Championship. Since no Oceania team placed among the top five at the Asian Championship, the IHF awarded an additional wild card.\nIn addition, several performance places were awarded for the continental confederations (12 places), which were based on the teams ranked 1–12 in the preceding World Championship.\nTaking into consideration the results of the 2021 Men's World Championship, 20 out of 32 places were distributed as follows:\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 2 July 2022 at the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra in Katowice.\nSeeding.\nFollowing ranking of previous World Championship, and following IHF rules.\nGroups.\nEach host country could assign one qualified team to each host city. Therefore Spain played in group A (Krakow), Norway in group F (Krakow), and Denmark in group H (Malmö). Germany in group E (Katowice), Iceland in group D (Kristianstad) and Croatia in group G (Jönköping).\nReferees.\nThe referee pairs were selected on 16 November 2022.\nPreliminary round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nMain round.\nGroup I.\nResults between advancing teams from Group A and Group B were carried over.\nGroup II.\nResults between advancing teams from Group C and Group D were carried over.\nGroup III.\nResults between advancing teams from Group E and Group F were carried over.\nGroup IV.\nResults between advancing teams from Group G and Group H were carried over.\nFinal ranking and awards.\nFinal ranking.\nPlaces 1 to 8 and 25 to 32 were decided by play-off or knock-out. Teams finishing third in the main round were ranked 9th to 12th, teams finishing fourth in the main round 13th to 16th, teams finishing fifth in the main round 17th to 20th and teams ranked sixth 21st to 24th. In case of a tie in points gained, the goal difference of the main round were taken into account, then number of goals scored. If teams were still equal, number of points gained in the preliminary round were considered followed by the goal difference and then number of goals scored in the preliminary round.\nAll-star Team.\nThe All-star Team was announced on 29 January 2023."

Middlesex County Cricket Club has played first-class cricket from 1864, List A cricket from 1963 and Twenty20 cricket from 2003, using a number of home grounds during that time. The Cattle Market Ground in Islington hosted the club's first home fixture in first-class cricket against Sussex in 1864; Lord's in St John's Wood hosted the club's first home List A match against Northamptonshire in 1963; and the club's first home fixture in Twenty20 cricket against Kent in 2003 was at the Old Deer Park in Richmond. Middlesex have played home matches at fourteen grounds, but have played the majority of their home fixtures at Lord's, which also holds Test, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket matches.\nThe administrative county of Middlesex ceased to exist in 1965 when its county council was dissolved, and the majority of the county club's grounds are now in Greater London.\nGrounds.\nBelow is a complete list of grounds used by Middlesex County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2014 season. Only matches played by Middlesex CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\nMiddlesex played a home game against Somerset at the County Ground Chelmsford, Essex in August 1977; the match having been scheduled for the previous week at Lord's but postponed due to a rearrangement of a one-day cup semi-final.\nThe Middlesex v Notts game on 15/18 July 1939 was played at the Kennington Oval due to rescheduling of games due to the preparations for an imminent war.\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs."

        "text": "The Giro d'Italia automobilistico was an automobile race around Italy, historically first held in 1901, then reinstituted as annual event between 1973 and 1980, resurrected for 1988 and 1989, and again in 2011. Both in its historical and modern iterations the Giro d'Italia was inspired by its French equivalent, the Tour de France Automobile.\nHistory.\n1901.\nThe first Giro d'Italia was organised by Club automobilistico di Torino (Automobile club of Turin) with the patronage of Milanese newspaper \"Il Corriere della Sera\". Seventy-two crews enrolled.\nThe race started on 27 April 1901 in Turin; of the 72 cars which had enrolled, only 32 were present at the starting line. These included nine Fiats, four Panhards, four Peugeots, three Renaults, two Rossellis, two Morses, and one each from Benz, Ceirano, Delahaye, Marchand, Daimler, De Dion, Isotta Fraschini and Darracq.\n1934.\nThe 1934 edition was held over three days and , on a circular route from Rome to Calabria and back, including a stage in Messina on the island of Sicily. Carlo Pintacuda and Mario Nardilli won in a Lancia Astura.\n1954.\nThe 1954 edition was held over ten days, seven stages and , beginning and ending at the Monza Circuit and stopping at Sanremo, Naples, Bari, Rimini, Merano and Turin along the way. Luigi Taramazzo and Gerino Gerini won in an Alfa Romeo 1900 SS.\n1973.\nThe first Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 24 and 28 October. The race was part of the Italian Group 4 Championship.\n1974.\nThe 2º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 14 and 20 October. The race was part of the Italian Group 4 Championship.\nThe works Fiat Rally team fielded four cars: two Fiat Abarth X1/9 prototypes (one driven by Ferrari F1 pilot Clay Regazzoni), a mysterious Abarth SE 030 prototype based on the yet unveiled Lancia Montecarlo (which scored a remarkable second place on its first outing), and finally a Group 4 124 Abarth Rally.\nLancia was only represented by the Andruet/Biche's victorious Lancia Stratos Turbo.\nAnother notable entrant was Arturo Merzario, on an ill-prepared Jolly Club Group 5 Stratos, stopped by an engine seizure already on the first day, at Casale.\nOf 85 on the starting grid, 52 finished the race.\n1975.\nThe 3º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 11 and 18 October.\nFor 1975 the coefficient for hillclimb races times was raised to 3:1, thus favouring rally drivers over circuit drivers, less accustomed to racing on closed public roads; no Formula One drivers took parts to the 3rd Giro. Autodelta fielded an Alfa Romeo 33/3 in Group 5.\nThe favourite Munari/Maiga duo ended sixth, but only after having witnessed their Alitalia Stratos Turbo burn to the ground after the last race. Winner were Pianta and Scabini on a 3.5-litre Abarth SE 031, a prototype based on a heavily modified Fiat 131.\n1976.\nThe 4º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 17 and 20 October.\nThe race was part of the Italian Group 4 Championship, Italian Group 5 Championship. A one-make \"Trofeo Alfasud\" was disputed by 15 Alfa Romeo Alfasud in separate races.\nAmongst the notable entrants there were two Lancia-Marlboro Stratos Turbo of Facetti/Sodano and Pinto/Bernacchini, with the \"silhouette\" body allowed by the newly enacted Special production cars Group 5 rules. Despite looking almost identical, the two cars were very different; Pinto's Stratos used the previous year's carburetted engine, while Facetti's one had an all-new fuel injected and intercooled engine developing about 100 PS more. Fiat sought to replicate its past year's success by entrusting Pinto another prototype 131, this time an unassuming Gr. 4 131 Rally made into a Group 5 car enlarging to 2.1-litre.\nOther Group 5 \"silhouette\" cars were Merzario's Ford Escort, Finotto's BMW-Schnitzer 2002 Turbo and Mannini's Fiat X1/9-based Dallara Icsunonove.\nFacetti won with\n1977.\nThe 5º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 12 and 16 October.\n1978.\nThe 6º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 13 and 18 October.\nIt was one of ten non-World Rally Championship races that counted for the FIA Cup for Rally Drivers. The race was also part of the Italian Group 4 Championship, Italian Group 5 Championship and the one-make \"Trofeo Autobianchi A112 Abarth\".\nWinners were Alén/Pianta/Kivimäki on a works Lancia Stratos; Pianta drove on the track, while the Alén/Kivimäki rally duo tackled the road stages. The car was a modified Group 4 rally car, classed in Group 5 as it was fitted with the 24-valve engine and other components which had lost their FIA homologation that year.\nMarkku Alén went on to win the FIA Cup for Rally Drivers, also thanks to points scored in the Giro.\n1979.\nThe two Lancias and other entrants were disqualified, and the first prize went to third-arrived Moretti, Schön and Radaelli privateer trio.\n1988.\nThe 9º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 16 and 20 November 1988.\n1989.\nThe 10º Giro d'Italia automobilistico took place between 14 and 19 November 1989.\nA poker of Alfa Romeo 75 IMSA took the top positions; the third classified D'Amore/Noberasco/Cianci were privateers."

        "text": "Ken Anderson (born January 16, 1933) is a retired American college basketball coach who spent 27 seasons at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. His winning percentage of .806 ranks third in college basketball history, behind only Mark Few and Adolph Rupp, and one spot ahead of John Wooden.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school.\nAfter graduating from UW–Eau Claire in 1955, Anderson began his coaching career at the high school level, with stops in Auburndale, Plymouth, Superior, and Wausau, compiling a 239–75 record with three state tournament appearances over 12 years among the schools.\nFort Lewis.\nAnderson's tenure in Superior was interrupted by the Berlin Crisis of 1961. While stationed at Fort Lewis as a U.S. Army Reserve Special Services Officer, he posted a 41–5 record as the coach of the Fort Lewis Rangers, whose roster included Green Bay Packers players Ray Nitschke and Boyd Dowler.\nUW–Eau Claire.\nAnderson was hired in 1968 by Eau Claire to succeed W.L. Zorn, who had retired following a 7–13 campaign. Anderson brought immediate results to the Blugolds, finishing his first season with a 14–8 record. Eau Claire won the first of five consecutive Wisconsin State University Conference titles in his second year, and advanced to the NAIA National Tournament, where they lost to eventual champion Kentucky State in the second round. The Blugolds returned to the NAIA tournament the following year, but were defeated in the quarterfinals by Eastern Michigan. The senior-laden 1972 team led by Mike Ratliff and Frank Schade advanced to the championship game, but were done in by a 39-point performance by Travis Grant as Kentucky State claimed a third consecutive title, 71–62.\nAfter five more trips to the NAIA tournament in Kansas City, including returns to the Final Four in 1980 and 1981, as well as a gold medal as coach of the United States team at the 1979 World University Games in Mexico City, Anderson was named head coach at the University of Wisconsin after the 1981–82 season. But with Badger athletic director Elroy Hirsch infamously on a Caribbean cruise, Anderson was repeatedly referred to by the wrong name at his introductory press conference, and he resigned four days later to return to Eau Claire.\nFollowing the turbulent offseason, the 1982–83 Blugolds posted the worst record of Anderson's career (15–12), but they soon returned to form, going 25–5 in 1983–84 and beginning a run of seven straight trips to Kansas City in 1985–86. They reached the Final Four in 1989 and returned to the championship game in 1990. However, as in 1972, their title hopes were thwarted by a massive individual effort. Although Duane Bushman scored 30 points for Eau Claire, Stacy Butler's 36 points led Birmingham-Southern to an 88–80 win.\nThe Blugolds returned to the quarterfinals in 1991 and made one final trip to Kansas City in 1992, but in 1994 Eau Claire became the last of the WSUC universities to switch affiliation from the NAIA to NCAA Division III.\nAnderson retired following the 1994–95 season, having compiled a record of 631–152, including 343–89 in WSUC play with 14 conference titles in his 27 years at the helm. His teams went 41–7 in NAIA District 14 playoff games, reaching the NAIA tournament 15 times and advancing to the Elite Eight eight times, the Final Four five times, and the national championship game twice. Anderson's record in NAIA national tournament games was 28–16, despite the fact that Eau Claire – like all WSUC universities, but unlike much of their competition – did not offer athletic scholarships. He was inducted into the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2012, the playing surface at UW–Eau Claire's W.L. Zorn Arena, where Anderson amassed a 387–44 home record, was dedicated as Ken Anderson Court."

        "text": "Nittawela Rugby Stadium is a purpose-built rugby union stadium in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is one of Sri Lanka's most famous rugby venues.\nHistory.\nKandy Sports Club's original home ground was Bogambara Stadium until in 1939 the British Colonial Army took it over during the Second World War. The grounds were subsequently handed over to the General Hospital to house their offices. Kandy SC however continued to play rugby at Bogambara but without a club house. In 1949 the Kandy Municipal Council resolved to provide the club with an area of land, a landfill site, at Nittawela. The preparation of the site took approximately five years and it wasn't until 1954 that Nittawela became the permanent home ground for Kandy SC.\nIn 1992 the gradient towards the entrance was levelled and a new pavilion was constructed, this was followed by the construction of the Central Finance grandstand and a pavilion named after Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa. In 2004 a further two stands were constructed and were named after two former players Priyantha Ekanayake and Nalaka Weerakkody. A media pavilion has also been constructed and is named after former club captain, Indrajith Bandaranaike. "

        "title": "Big Knockout Boxing",
        "text": "Big Knockout Boxing (BKB) is a combat sport brand developed and owned by DirecTV, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T The sport is essentially similar to contemporary professional boxing but utilizing a round-shaped non-lifted solid-base ring, which does not use ropes, corners, and three minute rounds.\nHistory.\nBKB was created by a group of experienced members of the fight industry. In 2013, the sport debuted with two events in New Hampshire. The Nevada Athletic Commission sanctioned BKB in March 2014. In August 2014, BKB debuted with a pay-per-view card at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas with approximately 4,500 attendees. Bryan Vera and Gabriel Rosado fought for the middleweight title. Rosado defeated Vera by the sixth-round TKO and won the title. Additionally, Anthony Johnson beat Dimar Ortuz by split decision for the cruiserweight title, David Estrada beat Eddie Caminero by unanimous decision for the junior middleweight title, and Javier Garcia beat Darnell Jiles by fifth-round TKO for the welterweight title. For the event, fighters wore traditional boxing gloves. In December 2014, BKB signed multi-fight agreements with Gabe Duluc, Javier Garcia, Herbert Acevedo, Khurshid Abdullaev, and Anthony Johnson. BKB held its second pay-per-view event at the Mandalay Bay led by Rosado and Curtis Stevens in April 2015. The seven-round title fight ended in a draw. Additionally, the event marked the first time the HitChip stats were used. The undercard saw the BKB debut of veteran Jesus Soto Karass defeating Ed Paredes, Anthony Johnson successfully defending the cruiserweight title versus Joey Montoya, David Estrada losing the junior middleweight title to Khurshid Abdullaev, and Javier Garcia losing the welterweight title to Jonathan Chicas. The event also featured BKB's first women's fight. The lightweight championship fight was between Diana Prazak and Layla McCarter and resulted in a win for McCarter with a seventh-round technical knockout over Prazak. The third BKB pay-per-view event was held in June 2015, again at the Mandalay Bay, and featured BKB veteran Julian Pollard defeat Rodney Hernandez (late replacement for kickboxing champion Tyrone Spong) by unanimous decision for the heavyweight title. The undercard featured another MMA veteran, Chris Spång, defeating Samuel Horowitz, the returns of Jesus Soto Karass and Ed Paredes (both lost to Adrian Granados and Janks Trotter, respectively), and the successful BKB debut of Shane Mosley Jr., son of boxer Shane Mosley. On July 22, 2015, Mosley Jr. and Pollard were suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission for failing their post-fight drug tests. BKB hasn't held any events since June 2015, and has no future events scheduled.\nRules.\nThe pit.\nBKB is contested in a 17-foot diameter circular surface known as \"the pit\". The pit's area is approximately half the size of a conventional 20-foot boxing ring (227 to 400 ft2). The small fighting surface is aimed to make fighters confront one another. Referees can deduct one point from a fighter if they intentionally step outside of the pit, that is enclosed by a raised padded area instead of rope.\nRounds.\nRounds under BKB rules last only two minutes, unlike traditional boxing's three-minute rounds. Title fights are seven rounds long and non-title bouts are five rounds long.\nAttire.\nFighters wear conventional boxing gloves. BKB developed the first in-glove microchip technology, known as HitChip, that provides viewers with statistics, including the speed of a punch and the pounds of force delivered by the punch."

        "text": "The Nishitetsu Baseball Club was a team in the Japanese Baseball League (JBL). Founded in 1936 as the Tokyo Senators, the team went through a number of name changes and mergers before being dissolved after the 1943 season.\nThe team's undisputed star for most of its history was two-way player Jirō Noguchi, who excelled as a pitcher. Other notable players for the franchise included Chujiro Endo, Yutaka Ishii, Sadao Kondoh, Toshio Kurosawa, and Jirō's brother Akira Noguchi.\nFranchise history.\nTokyo Senators (1936–1939).\nThe Senators were founded by a group that included politician Yoriyasu Arima. Saburo Yokozawa managed the team in 1936–1937. In the fall 1936 campaign, rookie pitcher Akira Noguchi went 15-13 with a 2.65 earned run average, following that with a combined 34–22 record in 1937, with a 2.21 ERA. (The 1936 and 1937 JBL seasons were split into spring and fall half-seasons.) Noguchi's 1937 totals led the league in games pitched and innings; he started nearly 70% of his team's games, and his 34 wins represented 68% of the Senators combined victories for the full season.\nAkira Noguchi left the team after the 1937 season, but he was replaced in 1939 as the team's ace by his brother Jirō Noguchi. Jirō's rookie season was remarkable: a workhorse, he went 33–19 with a 2.04 earned run average, setting a rookie record for victories. He led the league in innings pitched, most games pitched, complete games (a remarkable 38), and hits and home runs allowed. He pitched in 72% of the team's games and had 67% of their total victories. When not pitching, he often played outfield or first base (although he only hit .251).\nTsubasa (1940).\nFor the 1940 season, the team was renamed the Tsubasa Baseball Club (\"Tsubasa\" meaning \"wing\"). (In October 1940, responding to rising hostility toward the West due to World War II, the league outlawed the use of English in Japanese baseball.) In 1940, Jirō Noguchi put together another remarkable season, going 30–11 with a league-leading 0.93 earned run average. He also hit .260. He had nearly 60% of the team's total number of victories for the season.\nTaiyō (1941–1942).\nFollowing the 1940 season, the team was wholly acquired by Yoriyasu Arima; the failing Nagoya Kinko was also merged with Tsubasa and for 1941 the new team was renamed the Taiyō Baseball Club. Jirō Noguchi went 25–12 with a league-leading 0.88 ERA in 1941, becoming the only pitcher in Japanese professional baseball history to have two consecutive sub-1 ERA seasons.\nThe franchise had its best season in 1942, finishing with 60 victories and a winning percentage of .606, good for second place in the league behind the Tokyo Kyojin. Jirō Noguchi won two-thirds of his team's victories, a league-leading 40 (he also lost 17 games), to go with a 1.19 ERA, and a still-league-record 19 shutoutsas well as 264 strikeouts. That year Noguchi pitched all 28 innings of a tie game against Nagoya Club that featured Nagoya's Michio Nishizawa also pitching the entire game. The team's manager in 1942–1943 was Shuichi Ishimoto.\nNishitetsu (1943).\nFinancial instability led to the team being acquired in 1943 by Nishi-Nippon Railroad, and it being renamed the Nishitetsu Baseball Club. Despite finishing with a .513 winning percentage that year (with Jirō Noguchi winning 25 games), the team was dissolved before the 1944 season.\nLegacy.\nIn 1946, former team manager (and later Hall of Fame umpire) Saburo Yokozawa revived the Tokyo Senators team name. Although the team name was changed after one season, the franchise still exists as the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.\nNishitetsu gained a new baseball team in 1950 as the Nishitetsu Clippers joined Nippon Professional Baseball; the franchise is now known as the Saitama Seibu Lions."

        "text": "Nathan Earle (born 25 September 1994) is a Hong Kong-born English professional rugby union footballer. He plays at wing and full back. He plays for Ealing Trailfinders. Previously he had dual-registration with Saracens F.C. and Bedford Blues.\nEarle played for a young England XV against the Barbarians, scoring his first try on debut.\nEarle was called up to the senior England squad by Eddie Jones for their 2017 summer tour of Argentina.\nCareer.\nSaracens.\nEarle joined the junior academy of Saracens at the age of 14, in 2011, while attending Sutton Valence School in Maidstone, Kent. In order to get additional training time with them he chose to move to Oaklands college during his sixth form years. He notes former super-star Richard Hill as being particularly crucial to his time in the academy.\nWhile in the senior academy at the age of 17 he would play in the Saracens' team against the Asian Barbarians. This included a notable try where he defeated renowned All Black full-back, Mils Muliaina. Earle himself said this was less due to a particular physical or skill level of his but instead \"I'd say he was so hungover in that game, and I was fresh as a daisy – I in-outed him, and then put the afterburners on\".\nHis first-team debut occurred in 2012, against Worcester Warriors in the Anglo-Welsh tournament. However, in the 2013/14 season, Earle would only participate in 3 first-team games. Between injury and lack of opportunities Earle also received few chances to perform at first-team level in both the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons.\nHowever, in the 2016/17 season, due to injury and suspensions among other Saracens' wingers, Earle received a number of chances to perform. This included 7 Premiership games, 3 Anglo-Welsh and 3 European (ECC) games. It was these performances that would lead to additional England interest.\nThe 2017/18 season was anticipated to also have a higher rate of winger rotation, due to multiple international call-ups, and Earle participated in 14 Aviva Premiership games alone, scoring 7 tries - placing him in the top 5 try scorers for Saracens in the tournament. Earle ended his season by coming on as a replacement and scoring one of Saracens' tries in the Premiership final as they defeated Exeter 27-10.\nOld Albanians.\nTowards the halfway point of the 2013/14 season, in order to enable more play, Earle was dual-registered with Old Albanians, then in National League 1, where he would play 8 games over the remainder of the season.\nBedford Blues.\nAfter a season of minimal first-team play with Saracens, Earle was dual-registered with Bedford Blues, and participated well against Saracens in a pre-season game. However, in the first game of the season Earle suffered a major injury to his Achilles tendon.\nThere was significant consideration that the damage was so severe that Earle would have to leave his rugby career. However medical reconstruction and very long term physio-therapy allowed him to return to play within 9 months, although Earle stated that the injury \"did not feel normal for 18 months\".\nLondon Scottish.\nIn the 2015/16 season following the injury and recovery, due to a lack of junior player potential game-time (due to the absence of an Anglo-Welsh competition) played five times for London Scottish, between the British &amp; Irish Cup and the Championship.\nSumner Rugby &amp; Canterbury.\nIn May 2016, after again having had relatively little first team play, Mark McCall suggested he spend 6 months in Christchurch, New Zealand, playing southern hemisphere rugby.\nEarles originally played for the amateur/semi-pro side Sumner Rugby which plays in the Christchurch league. Already known by then Canterbury coach Scott Robertson (rugby union), as well as Scott's assistant, former Saracen Joe Maddock (rugby union) his performances for the club would get him invited to play with Canterbury for the remainder of his six months in New Zealand.\nEarles would be selected for 10 of Canterbury's games, including participating in both the team that would win the Mitre 10 cup, where he scored a try, and the side that won the Ranfurly shield. As a side note, he received his only yellow card of all his performances as of September 2018.\nAfter his return, Earle stated the time with the Southern Hemisphere team was particularly beneficial, especially his training with Joe Maddock. Earle cited several specific areas that he found improved while at Canterbury. He said the focus was on on-pitch training as opposed to gym work, with a corresponding focus on those skills. He also enjoyed the looser, faster-flowing, form of rugby as suited to his own style of play, particularly with Maddock's passing on expertise in quicker reading of the game. Finally he noted that the New Zealand club side had an enormous focus on \"micro-skills\" which targets extremely fine details such as foot placement.\nHarlequins.\nTowards the end of the 2017/18 season it was announced that Earle would join Harlequins, with a heavy indication that the move was to enable additional game time.\nNewcastle Falcons.\nEarle joined Newcastle Falcons ahead of the 2021–22 season. \nEaling Trailfinders.\nIn January 2023, it was confirmed that Earle had left Newcastle and joined RFU Championship side Ealing Trailfinders with immediate effect."

        "text": "The women's individual archery event at the 2016 Summer Olympics was held from 5 to 13 August at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. One of four archery events as part of the 2016 Olympic catalogue of sports, it was the fourteenth time a women's individual competition was contested as a discipline at the Olympic Games. Forty different nations qualified for the event, sending a total of sixty-four archers to compete. The defending Olympic champion was Ki Bo-bae of South Korea.\nSouth Korea's three archers were tipped for success, the nation having won all but one of the event's gold medals since the 1984 Summer Olympics. Ki and her South Korean teammates Choi Mi-sun and Chang Hye-jin dominated the initial ranking round and secured the top three seeds for the elimination rounds, entering the knockout phase having also won gold medal in the women's team event. Choi, who entered ranked as the world's number one archer, was however eliminated in the quarter-finals by Alejandra Valencia of Mexico; world number two Tan Ya-ting of Chinese Taipei, another favourite for the gold medal, also fell at the same stage. Chang defeated Ki in the semi-finals and went on to face Germany's Lisa Unruh in the final, defeating the German to claim her second gold medal of the Games. In the bronze medal match Ki beat Valencia to win her fourth career Olympic medal.\nChang's gold medal victory continued South Korea's near-domination of the event. Archery became South Korea's most successful Olympic discipline, while Unruh's silver medal gave Germany its first Olympic archery medal in sixteen years.\nBackground.\nThe women's individual event has been held as part of every Summer Olympics archery programme since the reintroduction of the sport at the 1972 Games in Munich; individual competitions for women had also previously been held at the 1904 and 1908 Summer Olympics. Heading into the Rio 2016 event archers from South Korea had been the most successful overall with seven gold medal victories, success coming particularly from the 1984 Summer Olympics onwards. The United States were ranked second in number of gold medals with four, with Great Britain, the Soviet Union and China having won one apiece.\nAt the previous Olympic Games held at Lord's Cricket Ground in London, Ki Bo-bae won the gold medal, reclaiming the Olympic title for South Korea after Zhang Juanjuan's victory on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Olympics interrupted a six-time winning streak for South Korea in the women's individual discipline. Ki had narrowly defeated Mexico's Aída Román in a one-arrow shoot-off in the final, earning her a second Olympic gold medal following victory in the women's team event four days earlier. Román and her Mexican teammate Mariana Avitia, who had defeated Khatuna Lorig of the United States in the bronze medal match, became Mexico's first ever Olympic medal-winners in archery.\nAn official test event, the Aquece Rio International Archery Challenge, was held over eight days at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in September 2015. The purpose of the event was to evaluate the venue's preparations and give archers and coaches the chance to familiarise themselves with the location and schedule ahead of the Games the following year. South Korea's Choi Mi-sun emerged victorious in the women's individual event by defeating Tan Ya-ting of Chinese Taipei in the final, with Mackenzie Brown of the United States third and Japan's Kaori Kawanaka finishing in fourth.\nQualification.\nSixty-four places were available for the event with each National Olympic Committee (NOC) represented by a maximum of three archers. Thirty-three of these places were open for the eleven nations qualifying for the Olympic women's team event, the 2015 World Archery Championships' women's team recurve event held in Copenhagen acting as the primary qualifying tournament in awarding twenty-four places. Eight nations - China, Colombia, Georgia, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Russia - secured the maximum berth of archers as the highest-placed teams. The remaining three team entries were decided at the Final Qualification Tournament held as part of the third stage of the 2016 Archery World Cup in Antalya, with Italy, Chinese Taipei, and Ukraine securing the final three-woman positions. As the host of the 2016 Olympics, Brazil automatically qualified three places as the twelfth team nation.\nThe NOCs that were unsuccessful in winning a three-member team entry were each limited to qualifying one archer. Of the twenty-eight remaining qualification positions, eight were awarded to the NOCs of the highest-ranked archers at the 2015 World Archery Championships women's individual recurve event, fourteen to those at a series of qualifying tournaments organised by the continental archery federations, and three to those at the Final Qualification Tournament in Antalya. The final three places were awarded to NOCs that entered fewer than eight athletes in individual disciplines at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, the motivation being seek to increase representation from non-traditional archery nations as well as abiding by the universal representation ethos of the Olympic Charter. The three NOCs selected were Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Myanmar.\nNational selections.\nWith the qualification positions for the Olympic event awarded to the NOCs of the successful archers, rather than the archers themselves, each NOC was free to choose its representatives through its own selection procedure. Defending Olympic champion Ki was chosen alongside Olympic debutants Choi Mi-sun and Chang Hye-jin to head the South Korean squad. The three had placed highest in the Korean national team selection competition which concluded in April 2016, Chang beating Kang Chae-young into third-place having narrowly missed out on Olympic selection four years earlier. Aída Román, the silver medalist from the 2012 Olympics, was joined by Gabriela Bayardo and 2011 Pan American Games champion Alejandra Valencia to spearhead the Mexican team, with London 2012 bronze medalist Mariana Avitia failing to rank highly enough in the national selection procedure to contest a third Olympic Games.\nSeveral nations selected experienced Olympians. Great Britain's Naomi Folkard and Georgia's Khatuna Narimanidze and Kristine Esebua were all chosen to compete in their fourth Games, while Greece's selection of Evangelia Psarra made her the most experienced Olympian in the field, Psarra contesting her fifth consecutive Olympic Games. The Chinese Taipei team featured one change from its London 2012 trio, Lin Shih-chia joining Tan Ya-ting and Le Chien-ying in what journalist John Stanley described as a \"formidable\" line-up. Russia too made just one change, retaining Ksenia Perova and Inna Stepanova from their 2012 team and picking Tuyana Dashidorzhieva as their third entrant. Following the publication of the McLaren Report concerning , the trio were approved and cleared to compete by the World Archery Federation in July 2016 having had no history of using performance-enhancing drugs.\nIndia also selected two athletes from its 2012 squad for its three-woman contingent, former youth world champion Deepika Kumari and Laishram Bombayla Devi partnering Olympic newcomer Laxmirani Majhi in the country's latest attempt to secure its first Olympic archery medal. In contrast, Italy's team of three was entirely new, Guendalina Sartori captaining the squad after the retirement of six-time Olympian Natalia Valeeva. Brazil likewise featured three Olympic debutantes in its lineup, the performances Ane Marcelle dos Santos, Sarah Nikitin, and Marina Canetta in the second and third stages of the 2016 Archery World Cup meriting their selection for the host nation.\nAustralia, Canada, and the United States were among those to send first-time Olympians as their sole representatives. Alice Ingley was promoted from her reserve role at the 2012 Olympics having shown good form at team selection camps, while Mackenzie Brown beat four-time Olympian Khatuna Lorig to victory at the US women's trials to secure her first Olympic berth. Canada nominated Georcy-Stéphanie Picard, who had previously represented her country at the 2015 Pan American Games. Zahra Nemati, the reigning Paralympic champion in the W1/W2 wheelchair discipline, was selected by Iran for her Olympic debut following her silver medal at the 2018 Asian Archery Championships. Nemati entered as the only archer competing in both the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.\nFormat.\nThe women's individual was an outdoor target archery event using recurve bows. Held under World Archery-approved rules, archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, each arrow earning between one and ten points depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition comprised an initial ranking round, five elimination rounds, and two finals matches which decided the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. In the ranking round, which took place on 5 August, each of the 64 archers entering the competition shot a total of 72 arrows. The total score of each archer was used to seed the archers into the following five-round single-elimination tournament, the highest-scoring archer receiving the number one seed. If two or more archers finished with the same total score, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring on the target was used as a tie-breaker. If two or more archers were still tied, then the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 ring determined the finishing positions. If the archers still could still not be separated then a disk toss was to be employed to decide the final order.\nThe elimination rounds and medal matches, held over four days from 8 to 11 August, used the Archery Olympic Round set system introduced at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the best score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lowest score in each set received zero set points. If the score was tied, each archer received one set point. The first archer to set six points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points apiece after the maximum five sets were played, each archer shot one more arrow with the one shooting closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nPre-event.\nWith South Korea's long-established record of success in the women's individual event, the trio of Ki Bo-bae, Chang Hye-jin, and Choi Mi-sun entered as favourites to challenge for the gold medal. Ki and Choi in particular were tipped for victory by several observers, including commentator George Tekmitchov, compound archer Sara Lopez, and World Archery journalist Andrea Vasquez. Jane Zorowitz of NBC predicted that Choi was Ki's biggest obstacle to retaining her Olympic title.\nOthers favoured those outside the South Korean team. Former Olympians Juan René Serrano and Natalia Valeeva picked Aída Román and Deepika Kumari as their favourites, whereas broadcaster Carl Arky selected Chinese Taipei's Tan Ya-ting as his choice for gold medal. Zorowitz also listed Tan and her teammate Lei Chien-ying as serious medal challengers, while Vinica Weiss of \"Sports Illustrated\" called Ksenia Perova as one of her athletes to watch. Peter Rutherford of Reuters further suggested that the rising number of archery teams employing Korean coaches in an attempt to emulate South Korea's track record would increase the number of contenders for the Olympic crown.\nRanking round.\nThe event began on the afternoon of Friday 5 August with the 72-arrow ranking round. Choi topped the leaderboard with a score of 669 points out of a maximum of 720, beating teammates Chang Hye-jin and Ki Bo-bae, who ranked second and third with 666 and 663 points respectively. By earning the top three seeds for the elimination rounds the trio delayed any potential intra-team match-ups until the semi-finals at the earliest. Choi had begun the round strongly and was on course to surpass Lina Herasymenko's twenty-year-old Olympic record of 673 points. Breezy conditions however intervened mid-way through the round, affecting her aiming and halting her progress. Speaking afterwards Choi commented that despite the weather she was happy with the performances of both herself and her teammates, saying \"[w]e have the best players, we have talent and skill. It's so windy that people can get overwhelmed, but we (did) well in the end.\"\nCiting a busy schedule, the Indian archers elected to skip the opening ceremony, which took place later in the evening of 5 August, to fully concentrate on the ranking round. Deepika Kumari and Bombayla Devi Laishram both made promising starts that afternoon, and by the halfway point Kumari was placed fifth and Laishram had risen as high as eighth. Inconsistent shooting from both however saw them fall away from the leaders over the final thirty-six arrows, Kumari concluding the round in 20th place with 640 points, while Laishram finished four places below on 638 points. The Indo-Asian News Service however summarised the Olympic debut of Laxmirani Majhi, the third member of the Indian team, as \"disappointing\", Mahji ending on 614 points in 43rd place.\nFor the three Italian archers, Michele Cassano of \"OA Sport\" was optimistic in his analysis of the potential match-ups to come following Lucilla Boari's seventh-placed finish with 651 points, but was more ambivalent about thirteenth-seed Guendalina Sartori, whose path to the latter stages of the competition included Kumari and Georgia's Kristine Esebua. He however likened Claudia Mandia's path to the circles of hell in Dante's \"Inferno\", the Italian scoring 612 points to finish forty-sixth and entering the elimination rounds in the same bracket as Mackenzie Brown, Finland's Taru Kuoppa, and reigning Olympic champion Ki.\nElimination rounds.\nAfter a two-day break over the weekend, in which the men's and women's team events were contested, the women's individual competition resumed on the morning of Monday 8 August for the beginning of the elimination rounds. Held concurrently with the same stages of the men's individual competition, the 1/32 and 1/16 eliminations lasted until Wednesday 10 August, while the women's 1/16 round took place on the morning of Thursday 11 August.\n8 August.\nMonday saw Ki in action, the defending champion winning her first two matches without dropping a set to advance to the last sixteen against Myanmar's San Yu Htwe. Hwte, who entered the competition through Myanmar's invitational place and was seeded fifty-first after the ranking round, pulled off two surprise results in a row by defeating both fourteenth-seed Taru Kuoppa and nineteenth-seed Mackenzie Brown, conceding just one set in each match. Ki's opponent in the final at the 2012 Olympics, Aída Román, was also in action but failed replicate her silver medal-winning run from 2012, losing to Moldova's Alexandra Mîrca in the 1/32 elimination round. Despite being seeded eleven places lower than Mîrca, the Mexican's loss was still regarded as an upset by Notimex, who concluded that her performance at the Games fell below expectations. Román cited the wind as her biggest difficulty on a day that saw greater wind gusts than on the previous day.\nSeventh-seed Lucilla Boari was another archer to suffer a surprise opening-round defeat on the Monday, losing to the Australian fifty-eighth seed Alice Ingley in the day's afternoon session. Boari's defeat was the second endured by an Italian archer that day, Mandia having earlier succumbed to Mackenzie Brown in the 1/32 elimination round. Francesco Lionetti of the Italian website \"Sportface\" blamed the defeats on the mood of disappointment in the Italian camp, which stemmed from Boari, Mandia, and Sartori having narrowly missed out on a bronze medal against Chinese Taipei in the women's team event the day before. Ingley was herself eliminated later in her second match of the day against Brazil's Ane Marcelle dos Santos. The Brazilian had earlier defeated Saori Nagamine of Japan, breaking down in tears as the home crowd gave her a standing ovation.\n9 August.\nThe second day of the elimination rounds on Tuesday 9 August saw fewer surprise results. Jane Zorowitz of NBC summarised that the day saw \"no huge upsets, and for the most part, those whom were believed to move on to the next rounds did.\" Iran's Zahra Nemati, the sole Paralympian in the competition, had the support of the crowd in her opening bout against Russia's Inna Stepanova, but despite a strong start ultimately lost by six set points to two. Speaking to the media after the match, Nemati described the Olympic competition as a far more stressful experience than that of the Paralympics. Stepanova advanced to meet fellow Russian Ksenia Perova in the 1/16 elimination round, Stepanova defeating her compatriot in the all-Russian tie by seven set points to three to progress into the last sixteen.\n11 August.\nThe elimination rounds concluded on 11 August. By reaching the last sixteen Ane Marcelle dos Santos achieved the host nation's highest ever finish in an Olympic archery competition achieving ninth place in the tournament's final standings. Naomi Folkard of Great Britain also achieved her personal best in reaching the quarter-finals on her fourth attempt. The quarter-finals also saw a major upset with the elimination of world number one Choi to the eighth seed Alejandra Valencia of Mexico, the Mexican winning in straight sets. Choi failed to recover after scoring only a five with her first arrow of the match, commenting afterwards that \"I couldn't focus on myself today.\"\nChoi's teammates Chang and Ki each won in their brackets to meet in the semifinals. As the defending champion Ki was the favourite to advance to the final, but Chang overcame a poor start - which included scoring a three with her second arrow - to win in five sets and progress to the final, ending Ki's hopes of becoming the first female archer to retain her individual Olympic title. Chang was joined in the gold medal match by Lisa Unruh of Germany, the reigning World Archery Indoor Champion. Unruh was a surprise finalist and later admitted she had had a disappointing ranking round in finishing 21st overall. Nevertheless, after three wins in the first three elimination rounds she defied expectations in the later rounds and defeated fourth-seed and world number two Tan Ya-ting in the quarter-finals and Alejandra Valencia in the semi-finals to reach the gold medal final.\nMedal matches.\nAs the two losing semi-finalists, Ki met Valencia in the bronze medal match, the latter shooting for Mexico's first medal of the Games. Ki however prevailed in four sets to earn her fourth career Olympic medal, the second highest tally for a South Korean archer after Kim Soo-nyung's six medals won between 1988 and 2000. Valencia nevertheless earned her highest finishing position in a world competition to date with fourth overall.\nIn the gold medal final Chang and Unruh each started well, winning one of the opening two sets apiece. Chang won the third set after Unruh faltered by shooting a seven, claiming the fourth set shortly afterwards by scoring two tens and a nine that Unruh could not overcome, earning Chang the victory and her first Olympic medal. The Associated Press praised Chang as a \"pillar of consistency\" amid wind gusts that made aiming difficult.\nChang's win was her second gold medal of the 2016 Olympics following South Korea's success in the women's team competition earlier in the week; she became the eighth female South Korean archer to win an Olympic gold medal in an individual event. It was also South Korea's third gold medal of the Games and the nation's twenty-second Olympic archery gold medal overall, overtaking the twenty-one gold medals earned in short track speed skating at the Winter Olympics to become the country's most successful Olympic sport. Chang's two gold medals earned her the top female athlete prize at the 2016 Korea Woman Sports Awards.\nUnruh's silver medal was Germany's first ever individual archery Olympic medal, and Germany's first archery medal since the German women's team won bronze at the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nRecords.\nThe world record score for a 72-arrow round had been improved since the 2012 Summer Olympics, with Ki Bo-bae setting a new record score during the women's individual recurve event at the 2015 Summer Universiade in Gwangju. Ki's total of 686 surpassed the previous highest tally set by compatriot Park Sung-hyun by four points, breaking a record that had stood for more than 10 years. The Olympic record score of 673 was set by Ukraine's Lina Herasymenko at the 1996 Summer Olympics and was later matched by Park at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nNeither record was broken at the 2016 Olympics."

In less than a decade after independence, the massive influx of South Asians increased crickets popularity. After the establishment of the Emirates Cricket Board in 1989, the United Arab Emirates officially became an affiliate member of the ICC. In the following year, the UAE became an associate member, with the likes of Kenya. In 1996, the UAE competed in the Cricket World Cup, with their debut along with Kenya and The Netherlands making them the 14th team to compete at the World Cup. They did not qualify for the World Cup until 2015, where they are currently playing in Pool B.\n1996 Cricket World Cup.\nThe United Arab Emirates was placed in Group B along with South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand, England and The Netherlands. They were first up against South Africa, which batted first and posted a score of 321/2. Gary Kirsten top scored with a blitzing 188 Not Out. The UAE were restricted to just 152/8 from 50 overs, with Arshad Laeeq top scoring with 43.\nTwo days later, the UAE played against England batting first. The top order collapsed and the UAE were bowled out for 136 from 48.3 overs. England, led by Graham Thorpe's 44 Not Out, cruised to victory in 35 overs with 8 wickets to spare.\nThe UAE next played co-hosts Pakistan. Batting first, they slumped to 109/9 from 33 overs, with Mushtaq Ahmed taking 3/16. Pakistan replied strongly, winning by 9 wickets in just 18 overs.\nDown and out, the UAE next played New Zealand, who batted first. New Zealand posted 276/8 from 47 overs, with Roger Twose posting a match high 92. The UAE again failed to cross 200, posting 167/9. New Zealand won by 109 runs.\nFor their last game, the United Arab Emirates faced fellow associate The Netherlands. After batting first, The Netherlands posted a modest score of 216/9 from their 50 overs, with Shaukat Dukanwala taking 5/29. The UAE replied with confidence, winning by 7 wickets with 5.4 overs to spare. Shaukat Dukanwala became the first UAE player to be named the Man of the Match at any Cricket World Cup game.\n "

        "title": "Troy Trojans women's basketball",
        "text": "The Troy Trojans women's basketball program is the intercollegiate women's basketball of Troy University. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I and the team competes in the Sun Belt Conference.\nThe head coach of the Trojans is Chanda Rigby, who is in her 12th season at Troy. During her first 11 seasons as head coach at Troy, the Trojans have made three NCAA Tournament appearances, one WBI Tournament appearance, two WNIT appearances, and have won three Sun Belt Tournament titles.\nThe team plays home games in Trojan Arena, which was built in 2012 and replaced the old arena known as Sartain Hall.\nHistory.\nJoyce Sorrell era.\nTroy's first season was in 1975 under then head coach Joyce Sorrell. Before Sorrell started the basketball program, Troy had no women's sports. Sorrell is considered the \"mother of women's athletics\" at Troy University. Sorrell maintained consistent winning records for her women's basketball teams. In 1978, she helped guide Troy to an upset win over Florida State, 80–63.\nThe next season (1978-1979), Sorrell scored an upset win over in-state opponent Auburn by a score of 76–70, and a few games later defeated Alabama, 85–80. The Lady Trojans would finish that season with a 21–9 record. For the 1979–1980 season, Sorrell once again led her team to more big wins, defeating Florida State and Florida in consecutive days. The Lady Trojans fell short in the state AIAW Tournament, but finished with a 19–11 record.\nSorrell's 1980-81 team won an Alabama AIAW State Championship and posted an 18-16 overall record on the season. Sorrell coached Troy's first ever All-American in Denise Monroe during this time, from 1977 to 1981.\nJoyce Sorrell led the women's basketball program through seven years (1975–82) as a member of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) before the NCAA began sponsoring championships in women's athletics in 1982. She then helped the program transfer from NCAA Division II to Division I in 1993-94 before retiring from coaching in 1995. She also coached nine 1,000-point scorers and 17 all-conference selections while coaching the Trojans through four different conferences, plus two seasons as an NCAA Division II independent.\nJerry Hester era.\nUpon taking over the head coaching position on an interim basis after Joyce Sorrell retired, Jerry Hester was hired as the full-time head coach. In 1997, his second season as head coach, he guided the Lady Trojans to their first Division I conference championship, winning the Mid-Continent Conference tournament and receiving their first-ever berth to the NCAA Tournament. Troy lost that year in the First Round of the tournament to #12 Virginia, finishing with a 23-7 overall record. Hester earned the Mid-Con's Coach of the Year honor that same year.\nThe following season (1997-1998), Hester started out the year with a 72–69 win at home against Mississippi State, but wasn't able to sustain the momentum throughout the season, finishing with just a 13-14 overall record.\nAfter struggling to find the same success he had in his first couple of seasons as head coach, Hester resigned from his position in 2002.\nMichael Murphy era.\nIn 2002, Michael Murphy was hired as the third women's basketball head coach at Troy. Murphy had previously been an assistant for the Alabama men's and women's basketball teams between 1997 and 2002.\nMurphy steadily improved the Trojans as the school transitioned from the Atlantic Sun Conference to the Sun Belt Conference beginning in the 2005–06 season. Murphy was never able to take Troy back to the success they had seen under Joyce Sorrell though, as he never garnered any championships and had only two winning seasons. In Murphy's last two seasons as head coach, Troy had accumulated a record of 7–51 in two seasons, which led Troy to fire Murphy in 2012.\nMurphy finished with a 110-179 overall record.\nChanda Rigby era.\nChanda Rigby was hired in 2002 after previously being the long-time head coach for Pensacola State College, where she won a state championship and took them to the NJCAA Final Four in each of her last two seasons. She led the Pirates to a combined 64–6 record over her last two seasons at the school.\nUpon Rigby coming to Troy, she immediately converted Troy to a fast-pace philosophy basketball team, which is what led to her success at the NJCAA level. Troy quickly became known for its high-scoring offense and up-tempo playing style over the next couple of years.\nIn the 2014–2015 season, in just her third season at the helm, Rigby led Troy to their first 20-win season in 18 years, finishing with a 20–11 record and a berth into the WBI Tournament. Troy would wind up losing in the First Round of the tournament to Mercer, 68–83.\nFor the next season, Rigby led Troy to their second-straight 20-win season, finishing the 2015–16 season with a 20–13 record and a Sun Belt Conference tournament championship. This marked the first time Troy had consecutive seasons with 20 wins or more. The Trojans would receive a berth into the NCAA tournament as a #15-seed, only to lose to #2 Oregon State, 31–73.\nRigby followed up her successes with yet another 20-win season in 2016–17, this time finishing with a 22–11 record. Troy would garner consecutive wins against Villanova and Loyola-Chicago in the San Juan Shootout during the first half of the season. Troy finished 3rd-place in the Sun Belt standings, garnering a #3-seed for the Sun Belt Tournament. After defeating Arkansas State, UT-Arlington, and Louisiana in consecutive games, Troy won their second-straight Sun Belt Conference tournament championship. Troy received their second berth in as many years to the NCAA tournament, losing in the First Round #2 Mississippi State.\nTroy would make their way back into the postseason once again during the 2018–2019 season, making their first-ever appearance in the WNIT. Troy finished the season with a 22-9 overall record, which included a 71–54 win over Ole Miss during the season.\nIn Rigby's best season at Troy to date, the 2019-2020 Trojans cruised through Sun Belt play with a 16-2 conference record and was crowned regular season Sun Belt Champions, earning the #1-seed in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. On March 12, 2020 the Sun Belt Conference cancelled their conference tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to Troy being awarded the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament due to them being the regular season champion. Shortly thereafter on the same day, the NCAA cancelled the NCAA Tournament, and all other conferences cancelled their tournaments as well. The Trojans ultimately finished the season with a 25-4 overall record, the best in school history.\nFollowing the historic 2019-2020 season, Troy was able to once again capture the Sun Belt title during the 2020-2021 season, this time by winning the Sun Belt Conference tournament. Troy would defeat Louisiana in the finals of the tournament by a score of 73-65. After receiving the #15 seed to the NCAA Tournament, the team would face the #2-seed Texas A&amp;M in the first round, losing in the last seconds on what was a controversial missed call by the officials. The final score would be 84-80, in favor of the Aggies.\nIn Troy's 2021-2022 season, the Trojans scored an upset over Mississippi State by a score of 73-66.\nYearly Results.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

        "text": " In men's international ice hockey, the Big Six is a group comprising the six national teams that have dominated play throughout the history of international ice hockey, especially since the 1950s. It is composed of the North American countries of Canada and the United States and four European countries: Czechia, Finland, Russia, and Sweden. During the Cold War and for two years afterwards, the Soviet Union/CIS and Czechoslovakia held the places of Russia and Czechia, respectively, within the group. The four European members are sometimes referred to as the \"European Big Four\" or \"Big Four\", especially to distinguish them from the North American teams.\nOut of the 210 Ice Hockey World Championships medals awarded by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), 187 have been won by the Big Six teams. Since 1953, only eight medals have been won by teams outside the Big Six (four by Slovakia, two by Switzerland, and one each by Germany and Latvia). Of the 75 Olympic ice hockey medals awarded, 67 have been won by a Big Six team.\nDespite the big medal haul between the 6 teams, being a member of the Big Six does not automatically guarantee success. As of August 2023, the United States' last appearance in an international final was the 2010 Winter Olympics, after which point Switzerland and Germany have reached two finals each.\nResults.\nOlympic Games Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes. However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow professional athletes to compete in the Olympic Games starting in 1988. The National Hockey League (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998. However, the NHL again refused to release its players in 2018, citing financial reasons. On September 3, 2021, NHL announced that its players will return to the Olympics and participate in 2022 tournament. Later, in December 2021, NHL and NHL Players’ Association agreed to not participate in the 2022 Winter Olympics due to COVID-19 surge.\nCanada Cup/World Cup of Hockey.\nThe Canada Cup served as an ice hockey world championship that was governed by National Hockey League (NHL) rules rather than IIHF rules, and was open to professionals so that NHL players could participate. The 1976 Canada Cup was, therefore, the first time that the best players from the leading ice hockey countries were able to face each other. The tournament was held five times between 1976 and 1991. Only one team outside of the Big Six, West Germany, was ever allowed to compete in the Canada Cup; this occurred in 1984 when West Germany replaced Finland because it had finished higher in the IIHF World Championship.\nThe World Cup of Hockey replaced the Canada Cup in 1996. It has been held three times so far (1996, 2004, and 2016), though its future is uncertain. Eight teams compete at the World Cup: Germany and Slovakia participated in the first two editions, whereas Team Europe, made up of European players whose countries did not have their own team in the event and Team North America, composed of players 23 years old and younger from Canada and the United States, played in 2016."

The closing ceremony was produced and directed jointly by three companies B5C Productions, BaAM Productions and FiveCurrents.\nThe tickets for the ceremony ranged between and .\nProduction.\nIn 2014 Live Nation was announced as a sponsor of the games; organizers stated that the company would leverage its resources to invite Canadian and international acts to perform at the ceremony. On July 15, 2015, organizers confirmed that American hip-hop artist Kanye West would headline the closing ceremony, joined by Pitbull and Serena Ryder. The announcement of West's participation was controversial, as critics and others believed that the closing ceremony should have been headlined by a Canadian artist; over 30,000 signatures were made on a Change.org petition to have him replaced. Mayor of Toronto John Tory, was also criticized for mistakenly referring to West as being a \"proud product\" of Toronto, despite actually being born in Atlanta.\nProgram.\nThe cultural portion of the ceremony took place on a stage with a scale model of Toronto's skyline, featuring a medley of dances representing various ethnic communities and music styles of Toronto. Following closing speeches by Ivar Sisniega, vice president of PASO, and Saad Rafi, president of the Toronto 2015 Organizing Committee, as per protocol, the Pan American Sports Organization flag was handed over by John Tory to Luis Castañeda Lossio, Mayor of Lima, Peru, host of the 2019 Pan American Games. This was followed by a cultural presentation by Peru, culminating with a sequence set to La Sarita's song \"Carnaval\".\nSerena Ryder performed \"Together We Are One\", the official theme of the 2015 Pan American Games, along with her own hit \"Stompa\". Pitbull's segment featured songs such as \"Fireball\" and \"Give Me Everything\". Kanye West opened his set with \"Stronger\". After calling upon the lights to be turned on, he continued on with a set that included \"Power, \"Black Skinhead\", \"Gold Digger\", \"Touch the Sky\", \"All Of The Lights\" and \"Good Life\". During his performance of \"Good Life\", West abruptly threw his microphone up in the air and walked off the stage; his performance had been afflicted by audio issues that caused his microphone to only be audible to television audiences. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display on the CN Tower."

        "title": "Analytics (ice hockey)",
        "text": "In ice hockey, analytics is the analysis of the characteristics of hockey players and teams through the use of statistics and other tools to gain a greater understanding of the effects of their performance. Three commonly used basic statistics in ice hockey analytics are \"Corsi\" and \"Fenwick\", both of which use shot attempts to approximate puck possession, and \"PDO\", which is often considered a measure of luck. However, new statistics are being created every year, with \"RAPM\", regularized adjusted plus-minus, and \"xG\", expected goals, being created very recently in regards to hockey even though they have been around in other sports before. RAPM tries to isolate a players play driving ability based on multiple factors, while xG tries to show how many goals a player should be expected to add to their team independent of shooting and goalie talent.\nHockey Hall of Fame coach Roger Nielson is credited as being an early pioneer of analytics and used measures of his own invention as early as his tenure with the Peterborough Petes in the late 1960s. In modern usage, analytics have traditionally been the domain of hockey bloggers and amateur statisticians. They have been increasingly adopted by National Hockey League (NHL) organizations themselves, and reached mainstream usage when the NHL partnered with SAP SE to create an \"enhanced\" statistical package that coincided with the launch of a new website featuring analytical statistics during the 2014–15 season.\nCommon statistics.\nCorsi.\nCorsi, called shot attempts (SAT) by the NHL, is the sum of shots on goal, missed shots and blocked shots. It is named after coach Jim Corsi, but was developed by an Edmonton Oilers blogger and fan who developed the statistic to better measure the workload of a goaltender during a game. However, today Corsi is used to approximate shot attempt differential for both teams and players, which can then be used to predict future goal differentials. If a team is losing in the goal differential halfway through the season, but possess a high Corsi, the team is creating more chances than their opponents which should result in the goal differential to get better as the team plays more games. Corsi is used to approximate puck possession – the length of time a player's team controls the puck – and is typically measured as either a ratio (like plus-minus) of shot attempts for less shot attempts against, or as a percentage. According to blogger Kent Wilson, most players will have a Corsi For percentage (CF%) between 40 and 60. A player or team ranked above 55% is often considered \"elite\".\nFenwick.\nFenwick, called unblocked shot attempts (USAT) by the NHL, is a variant of Corsi that counts only shots on goal and missed shots; blocked shots, either for or against are not included. It is named after blogger Matt Fenwick and is viewed as having a stronger correlation to scoring chances. Fenwick is used to help judge team and player performances that strategically use shot blocking as part of their game play. A player that blocks a high volume of shots will most likely have a lower Corsi due to them allowing more shot attempts than average. Fenwick by itself is less reliable than Corsi, but is the foundation for most Expected Goals models. \nPDO.\nPDO, called SPSV% by the NHL, is the sum of a team's shooting percentage and its save percentage. The sum is then multiplied by 10 and that total is the team’s PDO. The sum is also used separately to see if a team should expect a regression or improvement. PDO is usually measured at even strength, and based on the theory that most teams will ultimately regress toward a sum of 100, is often viewed as a proxy for how lucky a team is. According to Wilson, a player or team with a PDO over 102 is \"probably not as good as they seem\", while a player or team below 98 likely is better than they appear. PDO can also track individual players by taking the sum of their shooting percentage and the team's save percentage and then multiplying the sum by 10.\nPDO is not actually an acronym for anything. It comes from the online handle of Brian King, the first to propose it, for forums and Counter-Strike.\nZone starts.\nZone starts is the ratio of how many face-offs a player is on for in the offensive zone relative to the defensive zone. A player who has a high zone start ratio will often have increased Corsi numbers due to starting in the offensive zone, while a player with a low zone start ratio will often have depressed Corsi numbers. Strategically, coaches may give their best offensive players more offensive zone starts to try and create extra scoring chances, while a team's best defensive players will typically have more defensive zone starts. The formula for Zone starts is: SZ% = offensive zone starts / (offensive + defensive zone starts). In recent time, the use of zone starts in analysis has decreased. It has been determined that \"on-the-fly\" shifts account for more than half (58%) of all shifts.\nNew statistics.\nRAPM.\nRAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus) is a new hockey statistic based on the RAPM statistic used in basketball. Instead of tracking a player's points, it tracks a player's shots, because they occur more often than goals, which is required to give the statistic a high quality of samples. RAPM uses a mathematical model with ridge regression that takes into account raw shot creation, Corsi and xG, and outside influences such as Shot Volume, Shot Location (xG RAPM only), Teammate Impact, Competition Impact, Score Effects, Zone Starts, Schedule, Shot Type (xG RAPM only), and Even Strength State.\nThere is a Corsi RAPM model that uses raw shot differential and a xG RAPM model that factors for shot location and type. The goal of RAPM is to isolate a player's play driving ability and quantify it with a value.\nxG.\nxG models use UTSA and give each shot attempt a value depending on shot location and type. A shot from the slot might get a score of 0.30, whereas, a shot from the point may only get a score of 0.02. The model also takes into account if these shots are coming off rebounds or rush chances. This metric answers the problems of Corsi, which are that it values every shot equally. xG models, essentially track which players are taking high quality shots. The more high quality shots a player creates, the more likely they are to score.\nScore effects and situational modifiers.\nWhile hockey's analytical statistics can be used to measure in any manpower situation, they are most often expressed relative to play at even strength. The statistics can also be viewed relative to \"score effects\". Corsi close and Corsi tied, for instance, are restricted to when one team leads by one goal or when the game is tied, respectively. The use of \"close\" stats is intended to reflect the fact that a team leading a game will tend to play more defensively, meaning the trailing team will often take more shot attempts.\nCorsi close went under scrutiny that it did not predict future goals as well as unadjusted corsi, thus diminishing its value. Weighting each shot by the score situation (score adjustment) has taken over as the method to adjust for score effects. The situation of play also has to be taken into account during any score analysis."

        "text": "Matthew Robert Boyd (born February 2, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers.\nBoyd played college baseball for Oregon State University. In the 2013 MLB draft, the Blue Jays selected Boyd in the sixth round. He made his MLB debut with the Blue Jays in 2015 and was traded to Detroit during the season. He played for the Tigers through the 2021 season and played for Seattle in 2022.\nAmateur career.\nA native of Mercer Island, Washington, Boyd played his freshman high school season at Mercer Island High School before transferring to Eastside Catholic School in Sammamish, Washington. He graduated from Oregon State University, where he played college baseball for the Oregon State Beavers for four years. In 2011 and 2012, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star in 2012. In the 2012 Major League Baseball draft, the Cincinnati Reds selected Boyd in the 13th round, but he did not sign.\nProfessional career.\nEarly and minor league career.\nIn the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft, the Toronto Blue Jays selected Boyd in the sixth round. He signed, receiving a $75,000 signing bonus.\nBoyd was initially assigned to the Class-A Lansing Lugnuts, where he recorded a 0.64 earned run average in 14 innings before being promoted to the Advanced-A Dunedin Blue Jays, where he spent the remainder of the 2013 season. He posted an 0–2 record in Dunedin with a 5.40 ERA in 10 innings pitched. In 2014, Boyd pitched 90 innings with Dunedin, earning a 5–3 record, 1.39 ERA, and 103 strikeouts before earning a promotion to the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. He struggled in his first trip to New Hampshire, pitching to a 1–4 record, 6.96 ERA, and 44 strikeouts in 42 innings. Through his first nine starts with the Fisher Cats in 2015, Boyd led the league in both ERA (1.05) and strikeouts (56). He was promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons in June 2015 and made his first start on June 14 against the Charlotte Knights. Boyd took the loss, yielding two runs (one earned) with eight strikeouts and no walks in seven innings pitched for the Bisons. At the time of his call-up, he was considered the No. 19 prospect in the Blue Jays organization by MLB.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn June 26, 2015, Boyd was called up by the Blue Jays to start against the Texas Rangers the following day. He pitched 6 innings against the Rangers and took the loss, yielding 4 runs while striking out 7. Boyd's 7 strikeouts tied the Blue Jays franchise record for strikeouts in a debut.\nDespite having pitched 6.2 innings for the Blue Jays in 2015, the Blue Jays (who made the 2015 ALDS playoffs) elected to not award Boyd any money from the available pool of playoff share funds. This money is distributed amongst the team and staff; typically, players who were traded or released through the year are awarded partial shares or grants from the playoff pool. Although Boyd was shut out, monetary grants were awarded to several other Blue Jays players whose contributions were minimal, including Phil Coke (2.2 innings pitched), Colt Hynes (3.0 innings pitched), and Chad Jenkins (3.2 innings pitched).\nDetroit Tigers.\n2015.\nOn July 30, 2015, the Blue Jays traded Boyd, Daniel Norris and Jairo Labourt to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for David Price. He was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Boyd was recalled by the Tigers on August 5. Before being recalled, Boyd posted a 9–2 record and a 1.65 ERA in 19 starts between Double-A New Hampshire, Triple-A Buffalo and Toledo. In his debut for the Tigers on August 5, Boyd pitched seven innings, allowing seven hits, and one earned run, with two strikeouts, and no walks, earning his first career major league win, in a 2–1 Tigers victory over the Kansas City Royals.\n2016.\nOn March 30, 2016, Boyd was optioned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Boyd was recalled from Toledo on April 24 and made one relief appearance against the Cleveland Indians, but was sent back to Triple-A shortly after. Following the news that Jordan Zimmermann would miss a start, Boyd was recalled to the Tigers again on May 27. He was later placed in the starting rotation when Aníbal Sánchez was demoted to the Tiger bullpen on May 31. Following an ineffective start on June 18, Boyd was optioned to Triple-A Toledo for the third time this season. Boyd was back up with the Tigers by July 9, after both Jordan Zimmermann and Daniel Norris were placed on the disabled list within 24 hours of each other. He made the best start of his young career on July 18, allowing no runs and only three hits in six innings against the Minnesota Twins, earning the win in a 1–0 decision. On August 13, Boyd had his longest start of the season to date, allowing just two hits and two walks over seven innings of a 2–0 win against the Texas Rangers. In a September 20 victory over the Twins, Boyd pitched a career-high eight innings, giving up just three hits and a run, while striking out seven. Boyd had an improved season in 2016, posting a 6–5 record and a 4.53 ERA in 18 starts, while striking out 82 batters in innings.\n2017.\nBoyd began the 2017 season in the Tigers starting rotation. On June 2, 2017, Boyd was optioned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. Prior to being optioned to Toledo, Boyd posted a 2–5 record with a 5.69 ERA. Boyd was recalled to the Tigers on July 17 to make a July 18 start for the injured Daniel Norris against the Kansas City Royals. After Boyd earned the win in a 9–3 Tigers victory, the team announced they were optioning Blaine Hardy to Toledo and keeping Boyd on the major league roster. On September 17 against the Chicago White Sox, Boyd took a no-hitter into the ninth inning, until a two-out double by Tim Anderson ended the chance. Boyd retired the next batter for his first career complete game and shutout in the Tigers 12–0 win. For the 2017 season, Boyd started 25 games, going 6–11 with a 5.27 ERA and striking out 110 batters in 135 innings.\n2018.\nBoyd set career highs in 2018 with 31 starts and innings pitched, posting a 9–13 record with a 4.39 ERA and 159 strikeouts. He allowed only 146 hits during the season, his 7.714 hits per nine innings ranked 10th among qualified American League starters.\n2019.\nOn January 11, 2019, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Boyd, agreeing on a one-year, $2.6 million contract. Boyd posted 10 strikeouts in his first start of the season. In his next start on April 3 against the New York Yankees, Boyd recorded a career-high 13 strikeouts, becoming the first Tigers pitcher since 1908 to start the season with consecutive double-digit strikeout games. Boyd also set a record for the most strikeouts by a visiting pitcher at the current Yankee Stadium. His 13 strikeouts were the most by any Tigers pitcher since Max Scherzer recorded 14 in August 2014. On July 4 against the Chicago White Sox, Boyd became the first pitcher in the live-ball era to record 13 strikeouts and zero walks in an appearance of six innings or fewer. He finished the first half of the season with 142 strikeouts, the most strikeouts by a Tigers left-handed pitcher prior to the All-Star break since Mickey Lolich struck out 156 in 1972. On August 18, Boyd became the first Tiger pitcher to top 200 strikeouts since Justin Verlander in 2016, and the first left-handed Tiger to do so since Mickey Lolich in 1974. In 2019, he struck out 238 batters in innings for a stellar 11.6/9 IP strikeout rate, but he also had the worst home runs/9 IP ratio among major league starters, at 1.89. His 39 home runs allowed led the American League. Boyd finished the season 9–12 with a 4.56 ERA.\n2020.\nOn January 10, 2020, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Boyd, agreeing on a one-year, $5.3 million contract.\nIn 2020 he was 3–7 with a league-worst 6.71 ERA. He had the American League's highest totals of losses, home runs allowed (15), home runs allowed per nine innings (2.2), and slugging percentage against (.552), and tied for the AL's highest totals of earned runs allowed (45) and hits allowed per nine innings (10.0).\n2021.\nOn January 15, 2021, the Tigers and Boyd agreed to a one-year, $6.5 million contract, avoiding arbitration. On March 22, Tigers manager A. J. Hinch announced that Boyd would be the Tigers opening day starter. Boyd earned the opening day win on April 1, pitching six shutout innings in the Tigers 3–2 win over the Cleveland Indians. Boyd was placed on the 10-day injured list on June 15 due to a triceps strain, and was moved to the 60-day injured list on August 12. He returned to the Tigers on August 29 to make his first start since the injury, only to suffer a forearm issue in early September that ended his season. He made just 15 starts for the 2021 Tigers, posting a 3–8 record with a 3.89 ERA.\nOn November 30, 2021, the Tigers non-tendered Boyd, making him a free agent.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn March 20, 2022, Boyd finalized a deal with the San Francisco Giants on a one-year contract worth $5.2 million. The deal included up to $2.3 million in incentive bonuses, based on the number of starts Boyd made in 2022. However, Boyd never made an appearance for the Giants due to recovery from forearm flexor tendon surgery.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn August 2, 2022, Boyd and Curt Casali were traded to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Michael Stryffeler and Andy Thomas. He made his Mariners debut against his old team, the Detroit Tigers, on September 1, pitching a scoreless 8th inning. On September 4, Boyd recorded his first win of the 2022 season, as well as his first win with the Mariners. He pitched a scoreless 10th inning in a road game against the Cleveland Guardians, giving up no hits, and leading the Mariners to a 6–3 win in 11 innings.\nDetroit Tigers (second stint).\nOn December 14, 2022, Boyd signed a one-year contract to return to the Detroit Tigers. The contract has a base salary of $10 million, with an additional $1 million in performance-based bonuses. Boyd made 15 starts for the Tigers in 2023, registering a 5–5 record and 5.45 ERA with 73 strikeouts in 71.0 innings pitched. On June 26, 2023, Boyd departed a start against the Texas Rangers after allowing one run on one hit and two strikeouts in of an inning. It was later revealed that he had been pulled due to left elbow discomfort. The following day, it was announced that Boyd had been diagnosed with a partial sprain of his UCL and would undergo Tommy John surgery, ending his season. He became a free agent after the season.\nPitch selection.\nBoyd uses four primary pitches. He throws a four-seam fastball in the 8993 MPH range (topping out at 96 MPH), a slider that averages 83 MPH, a curveball at 75 MPH, and a changeup at 80 MPH. The slider has been his most effective offspeed pitch, yielding only a .205 batting average against (through 2020). In 2016, he threw more sinkers than any other offspeed pitch, but it proved to be the most hittable of all his pitches (.321 batting average against). Thus, he threw the pitch less in 2017, and rarely threw it at all in 2018.\nPersonal life.\nBoyd is married to Ashley Boyd. The couple have one daughter and one son and were expecting twins in November 2021. Boyd is a Christian.\nBoyd is distantly related to Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller, as well as former First Lady of the United States Dolley Madison."

The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Keith Allain, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nYale began the defense of their first NCAA Championship with a top-10 preseason ranking. Their regular season kicked off with the Liberty Invitational Tournament and, though they finished third, the Bulldogs found some success early in the season. Initially, the two freshman goaltenders, Alex Lyon and Patrick Spano, traded starts but by mid-November head coach Keith Allain had settled on Lyon as the team's primary netminder.\nThrough the first half of the season, Yale remained in the hunt to return to the NCAA Tournament. After defeating arch-rival Harvard at Madison Square Gardens they got up to #8 in the national polls, but the team began slipping afterwards. From the third week of January on, Yale wasn't able to sweep a single weekend for the remainder of the regular season. Worse, the team's performance against ranked teams was less than satisfactory. When the ECAC Tournament began, Yale had gone 1–6–2 against ranked teams, which put them on the bubble for an at-large bid. The Bulldogs needed a strong performance in the conference playoff to have any chance at a postseason bid and began their run with two solid wins in the First Round.\nTheir quarterfinal match against Quinnipiac would decide whether or not Yale could perform against good teams and if it had more hockey yet to play. The answer to both was 'no'; Yale surrendered 11 goals in 2 games and lost to the #6 team, leaving them with just a single win in 11 games against ranked opponents on the year.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | "

        "text": "The 2015–16 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan for the 49th consecutive year at the Crisler Center, which has a capacity of 12,707. This season marked the program's 100th season and its 99th consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The team was led by 9th year head coach John Beilein. Because this was Michigan's 100th season, the team was known as Squad 100 or Team 100\nThe 2014–15 Wolverines had entered the season coming off the school's winningest two-year stretch in history, but it did not reach the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament after losing starters Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton to season-ending injuries in January. The 2015–16 team follows the first season in five years in which the school did not make the NCAA Tournament. In addition to the season-ending injuries for LeVert and Walton the prior season, the team was coming off an offseason which saw Spike Albrecht and Zak Irvin have surgeries. Albrecht retired from the sport in December, although he later changed his mind. Later that month, Levert had an injury that ended his season. He only played in one conference game. He led the team in many statistical categories at the time of his injury and made midseason watchlists for various major national awards.\nThe team won two games in the 2016 Big Ten Conference men's basketball tournament and one in the play-in game versus Tulsa, also known as the First Four. The Wolverines finished the season 23–13. Following the season, Walton and Irvin were among the All-Big Ten conference honorees. Walton was a third team selection by the coaches and honorable mention selection by the media. Irvin was an honorable mention selection by both.\n2015–16 recruits.\nOn March 11, 2015, Michigan offered a scholarship to German Euroleague player Moritz \"Moe\" Wagner and he committed to Michigan on April 5. Brent Hibbitts accepted a preferred walk-on role with the class of 2015 over scholarships from Central Michigan, Western Michigan, Vermont, Appalachian State and American University.\nFuture recruits.\n2016–17.\nOn August 7, 2014, Jon Teske, who lived in the Grand Rapids, Michigan suburb Grandville until he was 10 and his family moved to Medina, Ohio, committed to Michigan via Twitter. On April 16, 2015, Austin Davis of Onsted, Michigan committed to Michigan. On May 11, Tyus Battle committed to Michigan. At the time of Battle's signing, the entire set of scholarships for the class of 2016 seemed to be allocated. On June 19, Battle decommitted from Michigan. On July 28, Ibi Watson committed to Michigan from Caris LeVert's alma mater Pickerington High School Central. On September 9, Xavier Simpson committed to the team. At the time he was ranked as the number 66 player and number 12 point guard by ESPN, number 55 and number 12 by Scout.com and number 87 player and number 44 guard by Rivals.com, making him the number 69 player and 13 point guard by 247Sports.com. Davis, Teske, Watson and Simpson all signed their National Letters of Intent on November 11, 2015.\nAmong the accomplishments of the recruits are Simpson earning the 2015 Ohio Associated Press Division I Player of the Year and Davis earning the 2015 Michigan Associated Press Class B Player of the Year awards as juniors as well as Simpson's 2014 Ohio Division III state championship.\n2017–18.\nOn October 23, 2015, four-star recruit Jordan Poole became the first commitment for the Class of 2017 after a home gym visit from Beilein and assistant coach Jordan and multiple Michigan campus visits. Poole had several competing offers including Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Memphis, Marquette, and Auburn.\nDepartures.\nIn June 2015, Max Bielfeldt announced that he had decided to use his redshirt year to play for the 2015–16 Indiana Hoosiers after the Hoosiers dismissed two forwards from the team the month before. Bielfeldt had considered several midwest schools and DePaul, Nebraska and Iowa State were his other finalists.\nPreseason.\nIn April 2015, Spike Albrecht had offseason surgery on his right hip to correct for a genetic condition that may also necessitate left hip surgery. Following the 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament several pollsters (including ESPN, \"USA Today\", NBC Sports) omitted Michigan from the expected preseason top 25, however some that immediately projected Caris LeVert to return to Michigan included Michigan in the rankings: CBS Sports (#18) and \"Sports Illustrated\" (#16). Bleacher Report ranked Michigan at 25 noting lower expectations if LeVert declared himself eligible for the 2015 NBA draft. On April 21, LeVert announced that he would return for his senior season. That same day, Max Bielfeldt was released from his athletic scholarship with one year of eligibility remaining. Despite all 13 of its scholarships being committed at the time, Michigan continued to recruit five-star 2015 McDonald's All-American Jaylen Brown and four-star Kenny Williams for the class of 2015.\nA scholarship for one of the potential recruits became available on April 27, when Beilein and rising sophomore Austin Hatch announced that Hatch, who had survived two plane crashes that killed his parents, siblings, and stepmother, would no longer play for the team due to medical issues stemming from injuries he suffered in the second crash. Michigan applied for and received a \"medical exemption waiver\" from the NCAA for Hatch; the waiver allows a school to keep a student-athlete who has career-ending medical issues on scholarship. Hatch transitioned to being a student assistant coach; as such, he was no longer on the active roster but could otherwise fully participate in the program. However, Brown committed to California on May 1. Williams committed to North Carolina on May 2.\nOn September 9, Beilein announced that Zak Irvin would be sidelined for 6–8 weeks, but that he was expected to be available near the beginning of the season.\nThe October 15 Preseason Coaches Poll listed five teams from the 2015–16 Big Ten Conference, while 3 others, including Michigan, were receiving votes. Michigan had the most votes of teams not included in the top 25. Two weeks later the preseason AP Poll included six Big Ten Teams with Michigan listed at number 25. Athlon Sports listed Michigan at 22. \"Sporting News\" ranked Michigan at number 18. NBC Sports listed them at 17. ESPN's 10-person panel selected ranked Michigan 22. \"Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook\" selected Michigan 17. \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked all 351 teams and listed Michigan at 27. The United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) ranked Michigan 23.\nCaris LeVert was named a preseason All-Big Ten selection, for the second straight year. He was also one of three Big Ten selections to the 20-man Jerry West Award preseason watchlist. He made the initial 50-man John R. Wooden Award watch list on November 17. On December 2, Levert earned recognition on the 50-man Naismith College Player of the Year watchlist and 33-man Oscar Robertson Trophy watchlists. That same day, Albrecht was named an Allstate Good Works Team nominee.\nThe team hosted its annual media day on October 22. The preseason would wind down with an open practice on November 2 followed by a \"Squad 100 Selfie\" promotion hour. Then the team had an exhibition game against on November 6, which pitted head coach Beilein's team against that of his son Patrick Beilein.

Robinson led the way with 21 points; while Irvin added 19 points and eight rebounds and Abdur-Rahkman posted 14 points. This was just the second overtime game in Michigan's Big Ten tournament history. Michigan defeated Purdue, 79–73, on March 14, 1999. The game marked Irvin's 100th career game with Michigan, becoming just the 64th Wolverine to reach the milestone. On March 11, Michigan defeated No. 1-seeded (#10/#10) Indiana in the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament, 72–69. Kameron Chatman scored the game-winning three-pointer as time expired to give the Wolverines the win. Irvin led the way with a team-high 17 points, while Walton set a Big Ten tournament single-game record with 12 assists. Robinson again put Michigan in position to win by tying the score with a three-point shot with 46 seconds remaining. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game, to set a new single-season program record for three-pointers in a season with 320, surpassing the previous record of 319 set during the 2013–14 season. On March 12, Michigan lost to (#13/#13) Purdue in the semifinals of the Big Ten tournament, 59–76. Purdue opened the game with an 8–0 scoring run and took a 38–30 lead into halftime. After trailing by as many as 17 early in the second half, the Wolverines fought back to within six only to be outscored 16–5 in the last 7:35 of the game. Abdur-Rahkman led the way with 15 points, while Walton added 14 points and Irvin posted 11 points. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 326. With five assists in the game, Walton is now tied for third-most assists in a single Big Ten tournament with 22, with Brent Darby (2003). Robinson recorded his 90th three-pointer of the season, becoming just the fifth Wolverine in history to reach the milestone in a single season. Irvin was selected to the All-Tournament Team.\nOn March 13, Michigan received an at-large bid to the 2016 NCAA tournament. The Wolverines are the No. 11 seed in the East Region and faced No. 11 Tulsa in the First Four on March 16 in Dayton, Ohio. Michigan is in the tournament field for the fifth time in the last six seasons after missing out on the 2015 tournament field. Beilein's Wolverines advanced to the national title game in 2013 and followed with an Elite Eight performance in 2014. Michigan is one of three Big Ten teams in the east region (along with Wisconsin and Indiana). On March 16 in the First Four, Michigan defeated Tulsa, 67–62, to advance to the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. After falling behind 16–9, Michigan ended the first half on a 19–4 scoring run to take an eight-point lead into halftime. Irvin hit the go-ahead three-pointer with 53 seconds left to put the Wolverines up by two points. Michigan was led by Abdur-Rahkman and Irvin with 16 points, while Robinson recorded his first double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds. The game was the first-ever meeting between the two teams in program history. Michigan recorded six three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 332. On March 18, Michigan lost to No. 6 seed Notre Dame, 63–70. Michigan finished the first half on a 7–0 run to take a 41–29 lead at halftime. Notre Dame came out with a 15–5 run to start the second half, cutting Michigan's lead to three points. Notre Dame did not take a lead in the game until Beacham's three-pointer with 9:26 left to make it 51–48. From there on there were five lead changes and three ties. Abdur-Rahkman led Michigan in scoring with 15 points, four rebounds, three assists and one steal, while Walton recorded a career-high six steals, along with 10 points, eight assists and four rebounds. Michigan recorded 10 three-pointers in the game to extend their single-season record for three-pointers in a season to 342.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961; color:#F7BE05;\"| Non-conference Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#242961;\"| NCAA tournament\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nRoster.\nDonnal was reclassified from redshirt sophomore to junior at Michigan at the beginning of the season, indicating that he might not use all of his three remaining years of eligibility at Michigan.\nMidseason recognition.\nLeVert was one of four Big Ten athletes (along with Melo Trimble, Jarrod Uthoff and Denzel Valentine) among the 25 players included in the Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List on January 13.

        "text": "The 2015 Monaco Grand Prix, formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2015, was a Formula One motor race that was held on 24 May 2015 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the principality of Monaco. It was the sixty-second running of the race as a World Championship event, and seventy-third running overall.\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the race with a twenty-point lead over teammate and defending race winner Nico Rosberg in the Drivers' Championship, with Mercedes having a seventy-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship.\nWorld Champion Lewis Hamilton secured his first ever Monaco pole position during Saturday's qualifying. In the race, Nico Rosberg took his third consecutive win at Monaco, second win of the season, and the tenth of his career, while Sebastian Vettel finished second. Championship leader Hamilton, who had led for most of the race, moved from first into third place following a \"pit stop misjudgement\" during a late safety car period, for which his team, Mercedes, later apologised. The renewed McLaren-Honda partnership scored its first points since Honda's return to the sport. With Rosberg's victory, he was able to reduce his deficit in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points.\nReport.\nBackground.\nAhead of the race weekend, Mercedes announced they had extended their contract with world champion Lewis Hamilton for three additional years, keeping him at the team until the end of the 2018 season.\nRevisions to the Tabac corner at the harbour section of the race track meant that the drivers now entered the turn slightly earlier, shortening the track by compared to previous years, and making the corner slightly tighter and slower. The corner had seen a race-stopping accident involving Pastor Maldonado and Max Chilton in 2013, leading to the changes being made. This resulted in the circuit being officially classified as a new layout. The barrier on the right of the swimming pool chicane was moved back, with new kerbs, to allow for a better view of the corner. Much of the track was resurfaced before the event. As in Australia and Singapore, the pit lane speed limit for the duration of the event was reduced to , instead of the standard , due to the confined nature of the circuit. The race schedule for the weekend was different in Monaco compared to the other races on the calendar. The first two free practice sessions were held on Thursday instead of Friday.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-marked soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-marked super-soft compound tyre as the more elastic \"option\" tyre, just as they did the previous three seasons. It was the first time in the 2015 season that the super-soft compound would be used at a race weekend.\nFree practice.\nAs per the regulations for , three practice sessions were held, two one and a half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, the first of the two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places at the top of the time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.\nThe second session on Thursday afternoon saw considerably less running than the first. A red flag was shown ten minutes into practice after Roberto Merhi crashed on the exit of the tunnel. During the stoppage, rain began to fall, keeping most drivers in the garage when practice was restarted. It was not until ten minutes from the end of the session that the drivers took to the track again, but under damp conditions they managed times that were slower than the pace set at the beginning. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, more than seven-tenths of a second in front of his teammate. Toro Rosso confirmed their high pace with Carlos Sainz Jr. and Max Verstappen in sixth and seventh respectively, while McLaren proved they might challenge for points as predicted, with Fernando Alonso in eighth place.\nThe third practice on Saturday morning was interrupted midway through the session when Kimi Räikkönen crashed his Ferrari at Sainte Dévote. His teammate Sebastian Vettel set the fastest lap during the session, ahead of the Mercedes' of Rosberg and Hamilton. Hamilton reported problems with his car, believed by his race engineer to be caused by over-pressured tyres. The two Renault-powered teams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso, confirmed their strong pace by placing all four cars in the top ten.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. The first part (Q1) saw a \"a surprise casualty\" when Valtteri Bottas failed to cross the line for his final lap in time, leaving him seventeenth on the grid. The two Manor Marussia drivers finished last, as they had in every qualifying session they participated in up to that point during the 2015 season. Joining them on the sidelines were the two Sauber cars of Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson, split by Bottas.\nWhile McLaren once again succeeded in advancing both cars into Q2, Fernando Alonso's car stopped in the first corner due to an electrical fault at the start of the second session, and he took no further part in qualifying. Teammate Jenson Button was more successful, missing out on Q3 when his second fast lap was interrupted by Nico Rosberg going off at Sainte Dévote. The second Williams of Felipe Massa completed a problematic Saturday for the team, claiming only 14th on the grid, while Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean also did not make it into Q3.\nThe third part of qualifying, contested by the top ten drivers, started with drops of rain falling, meaning all drivers took to the track quickly. Sergio Pérez, who made his first Q3 appearance of the 2015 season, had only one set of super-soft tyres left and finished seventh. Lewis Hamilton took an early lead with his first run and teammate Nico Rosberg was denied a chance to challenge him for pole position when he made a mistake in turn one during his second fast lap. The two Red Bull drivers separated the two Ferrari cars, leaving Kimi Räikkönen with another disappointing qualifying performance down in sixth. It was the first pole position for Hamilton in Monaco, who called it \"incredibly special\".\nCarlos Sainz Jr., who had qualified in eighth position, was adjudged to have missed a call to go to the weigh bridge during the first part of qualifying. Following the session, he was given a penalty which required him to start the race from the pit lane.\nRace.\nAt the start of the race Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel maintained their grid positions into the first corner, while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth. Trying to get past Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, who hit the wall but was able to continue, though at the back of the field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to serve at his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.\nBy lap ten, Hamilton had built a three-second lead over his teammate Rosberg, who was an additional 1.7 seconds ahead of Vettel. While some drivers came into the pit lane for their first regular stop as early as lap 13, the top runners stayed out until lap 37, when Vettel was the first to come in, followed by Rosberg and Hamilton one lap later respectively. Following the stops, Hamilton led Rosberg by seven seconds. Max Verstappen dropped down the order when a problem at the rear of the car caused him to be stationary for 31 seconds during his stop on lap 30. Fernando Alonso, who had been running in ninth place, retired from the race with a gearbox failure on lap 43. By lap 45, Hamilton had extended his lead to ten seconds, while Rosberg remained two seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.\nBy lap 59, Verstappen on the fast super-soft tyres was chasing Lotus driver Romain Grosjean for tenth position, with Verstappen making several attempts to pass over the following laps. At the beginning of lap 64, coming into turn one, Verstappen crashed into the back of the Lotus, sending him flying at 30g into the barriers. While he was able to walk away from the accident without injuries, a \"Virtual Safety Car\" condition was called by the race director to allow marshals to safely recover the damaged car. This was the first time a Virtual Safety Car had been used in Formula One. Shortly thereafter, the regular safety car was sent out on track. Lewis Hamilton, who had been leading the race by almost twenty seconds, was pitted apparently with the intention of returning him to the track ahead of his pursuers. The Mercedes pitwall crew, however, miscalculated the gap allowing Rosberg to take the lead while Hamilton emerged from the pit exit lane marginally behind Vettel who had stayed out under the safety car behind Rosberg. With the safety car coming into the pit lane on lap 70 of 78, Rosberg retained the lead unchallenged going on to win the Monaco Grand Prix for a third consecutive time whereas Hamilton finished third, unable to overtake Vettel for second position. Daniel Ricciardo had also made a pit stop under the safety car, and on fresh tyres he was able to pass Kimi Räikkönen in controversial circumstances. His teammate Kvyat then let him past in order to give him the chance to try and pass third-placed Hamilton. When Ricciardo was unable to overtake, he handed fourth place back to Kvyat. Ricciardo set the fastest lap of the race in the process. Jenson Button finished eighth, scoring four championship points for himself and the McLaren team, the first points for the renewed McLaren-Honda partnership since their return at the start of the 2015 season.\nPost-race.\nFollowing the race, Mercedes apologised to Hamilton for the pit call, which commentators such as F1Fanatic's Keith Collantine, Formula One correspondent for \"The Guardian\" Paul Weaver, and former Formula One driver David Coulthard felt cost him the victory. Team boss Toto Wolff told the press: \"We got our numbers wrong. We thought we had the gap for Lewis to take fresh tyres and come back out in the lead behind the safety car, ahead of Nico and covering off any risk of another competitor taking fresh tyres. But the calculation was incorrect and he came out in third place.\" Indeed, more than half of the teams made a pit stop at least one car when the safety car was deployed, just as Hamilton did. However, he as race leader caught up with the safety car quicker and lost a considerably larger amount of time on his way into the pit lane, leading to him coming out behind Rosberg and Vettel.\nDuring the post-race press conference, Hamilton revealed the decision to pit him was made after he had voiced concern over the heat in his tyres, being under the false impression that his rivals behind had already made a pit stop for the softer compound. When asked whether he would have full confidence in the team's strategy decisions in the future, he answered \"yes\". At the podium interviews, conducted by Martin Brundle, Rosberg admitted his victory \"was just a lot of luck\" and added that \"Lewis drove brilliantly and he would have also deserved the win for sure\". Rosberg became the fourth driver overall, and the first since Ayrton Senna, to win the Monaco Grand Prix three times in a row.\nFollowing the accident with Romain Grosjean, the race stewards handed Max Verstappen a five-place grid penalty for the next race, the . For the first time in his Formula One career, Verstappen also had two penalty points added to his FIA Super Licence. Verstappen was criticised for his actions by fellow driver Felipe Massa, who said that he deserved the penalty. Verstappen reacted by insisting that he had done nothing wrong, instead pointing to Massa's own accident at the 2014 Canadian Grand Prix, where Massa had crashed into the back of Sergio Pérez in similar fashion. Immediately following the race, Verstappen had accused Grosjean of \"brake-testing\" him, a claim denied by Grosjean, who insisted that he had braked even later than the lap before.\nThe race results meant that Nico Rosberg moved closer towards his teammate's championship lead, now ten points behind Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel followed another 18 points behind. Meanwhile, in the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes extended their lead over Ferrari to 84 points."

        "text": "The 2015 British Grand Prix (formally known as the 2015 Formula 1 British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 5 July 2015 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. The race was the ninth round of the 2015 season, and marked the 70th running of the British Grand Prix, and the 51st time that the race was held at the Silverstone Circuit.\nLewis Hamilton was the defending race winner, and came into the event with a ten-point lead over teammate Nico Rosberg in the World Drivers' Championship. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes were leading Ferrari by 136 points, with Williams a further 63 points adrift.\nHamilton took pole position during Saturday's qualifying, his eighth of the season, ahead of Rosberg and the two Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. The first lap of the race saw the Massa and Bottas take first and second place respectively through fast starts. They were able to hold their positions until the pit stops. Rain in the latter part of the race gave Sebastian Vettel the chance to overtake the two Williams for the last podium position. Hamilton won the race for the second consecutive year, 11 seconds ahead of his teammate, extending his championship lead to 17 points.\nReport.\nBackground.\nComing to Silverstone, Force India introduced a new version (\"B-spec\") of their VJM08, featuring a shorter nose with \"nostrils\". After a problem with a wheelnut had caused problems for Sebastian Vettel at the previous race in Austria, Ferrari chose to revise its wheelnut system for the British Grand Prix. Manor Marussia secured new sponsorship ahead of the race, thus changing its livery. The race marked the 900th Grand Prix contested by at least one car using a Ferrari engine.\nPirelli nominated their two hardest dry-weather compounds for the event; the white-banded medium tyre as the option selection, while the orange-banded hard tyre would be the prime compound. The company also supplied their two wet-weather tyres, as they do for all events; the green-banded intermediate tyre and the blue-banded full wet tyre.\nSilverstone was used in its revised 2011 Arena Grand Prix layout, which has been described as \"one of the fastest circuits in the F1 calendar\". The \"fast, flowing circuit\" featured 18 turns, with Stowe and Vale corners being the best overtaking opportunities.\nLewis Hamilton came into the weekend with a ten-point lead over teammate Nico Rosberg, after Rosberg took victory in Austria. In the constructors' championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by 136 points, while third placed Williams had moved closer to Ferrari in Austria. The race stewards for the weekend were FIA World Council member Lars Österlind, President of the Barbados Motoring Federation Andrew Mallalieu and world champion Nigel Mansell.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the season, three practice sessions were held, two one and a half-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. In the first practice session on Friday morning, Nico Rosberg posted the fastest time, after recovering from early hydraulic problems that forced his team to exchange his gearbox. Rosberg was eventually 0.07 seconds quicker than teammate Lewis Hamilton. Max Verstappen was 1.2 seconds down on Rosberg in third, proving the Toro Rosso chassis was competitive for the weekend. Taking part in first practice were test drivers Jolyon Palmer, replacing Romain Grosjean at Lotus, Susie Wolff in Valtteri Bottas' Williams FW37, and Raffaele Marciello for Sauber instead of Marcus Ericsson.\nThe second session on Friday afternoon was red-flagged early on when Romain Grosjean got stuck in a gravel trap at Luffield corner. Nico Rosberg was once again fastest ahead of the two Ferrari drivers and teammate Hamilton, who complained about the setup of his car. McLaren and Sauber endured difficult sessions, finishing only ahead of the two Manor Marussia cars. It was Manor Marussia driver Roberto Merhi who brought out a second red flag, when his car beached at the same spot that had caught out Grosjean earlier. After the Williams drivers only finished tenth and twelfth, Felipe Massa stated that his team was behind Red Bull.\nIn the third and final practice session, held on Saturday morning, World Champion Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, half a second ahead of his teammate, who spent the better part of the session in the garage while his team investigated a possible gearbox oil leak. Behind the Mercedes cars were the two Ferraris and the two Toro Rossos, with only Kimi Räikkönen coming within a second of Hamilton's time. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso was confined to only six laps, ending his session early.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. Before qualifying began, race directors warned the drivers to respect track limits, especially at Copse corner. Still, eleven drivers ultimately had times disallowed for leaving the track with all four wheels in the corner over the course of qualifying. Pastor Maldonado lost two of his lap times, including his best in Q1, and barely made it into Q2. This came at the expense of the two McLaren drivers, the two Manor Marussia cars and Sauber's Felipe Nasr, who all failed to proceed into the second part. Meanwhile, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest during the session.\nThe second part of qualifying (Q2) saw both Lotus drivers eliminated, as well as Max Verstappen who complained about lack of rear grip. Sergio Pérez qualified eleventh while Grosjean in 12th had his best time disallowed for exceeding the track limits. However, his second best time proved sufficient to keep his position.\nQ3 saw the top-ten drivers compete for pole position, which eventually went to Lewis Hamilton, beating teammate Rosberg by 0.113 seconds. Both Mercedes drivers were unable to improve on their first times set in the session, with Hamilton aborting his run and returning to the pit lane before the session was over. After securing two podium finishes in the past two races, Williams confirmed their improved form and took the second row on the grid, Massa ahead of Bottas. It was the twentieth consecutive pole position for Mercedes, being four races shy of a record set by Williams in \nRace.\nThe sell-out race on Sunday was held in front of a crowd of 140,000. On the way to the grid, Felipe Nasr experienced gearbox issues and had to retire. After the lights went out, both Mercedes cars did not get away well, allowing the two Williams cars of Massa and Bottas to move into first and third respectively, with Bottas almost getting the better of Lewis Hamilton. Further back, Nico Hülkenberg was quick off the line as well, jumping from ninth to fifth at the expense of Daniil Kvyat and the two Ferraris. At the back of the grid, Daniel Ricciardo touched Romain Grosjean into Turn 3, causing Grosjean to turn into his teammate Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso, who had to turn away to avoid the accident, collided with teammate Jenson Button, who along with both Lotus drivers had to retire. While Alonso made a pit stop for a new nose, the incident brought out the safety car, which led the field until the start of lap four. Hamilton immediately attacked Felipe Massa, only to run wide on Vale, allowing Bottas to take second place on the inside of Club. Meanwhile, Sergio Pérez overtook Sebastian Vettel for ninth, while Max Verstappen retired after a spin in the gravel.\nOver the next couple of laps, Williams exercised team orders, and told their drivers to avoid racing each other to pull away from the Mercedes cars. Bottas complained that he was faster and requested permission to overtake for the lead, which Williams granted. His pace did not improve, however, but the top four pulled away from the midfield, leading Nico Hülkenberg in fifth by seven seconds on lap 13. Both Ferrari drivers made a pit stop for new tyres early, on laps 14 and 15, apparently set for a two-stop strategy. On lap 20, Lewis Hamilton opted for the undercut, coming in for a new set of tyres. Massa, then in the lead, and Rosberg, in fourth place came in a lap later. On exit, both fought on the pit lane wheel to wheel, but Massa's lead proved sufficient for provisional second. Bottas came in a lap later, but Hamilton's out-lap, the fastest of the race, saw the world champion take the lead, with Bottas in third; splitting Massa and Rosberg. Daniel Ricciardo retired with an electrical failure on lap 23.\nBy the halfway point, the drivers were told that rain was expected before the end of the race. When Carlos Sainz Jr. lost speed and retired on track due to an electrical failure, the race saw a brief Virtual Safety Car period on laps 33 and 34, after which the first drops of rain hit the circuit, initially hitting the area around the pit lane. By lap 38, drivers started to lose traction. Sebastian Vettel managed to overtake teammate Räikkönen on lap 39, with Räikkönen making a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, which proved to be a poor choice as the track was not wet enough yet. Meanwhile, Rosberg took third from Bottas on the same lap, and took second from Massa two laps later. Räikkönen lost additional places and dropped down to ninth on his intermediate tyres. Rosberg, on the slicks, pushed hard and significantly reduced Hamilton's lead, only 3.7 seconds behind by lap 43. In response Hamilton made a pit stop for intermediate tyres himself, which Vettel imitated. The strategy proved effective, as the rain came on just then, with Rosberg and both Williams cars dashing into the pit lane in the subsequent laps, but the stops proved too late as Massa and Bottas fell behind Vettel, with Hamilton managing to improve his lead to nine seconds over Rosberg.\nOn lap 49, Will Stevens went wide into the barriers, losing his front wing. He was able to continue, but the subsequent nose change demoted him to last place. Hamilton held on to his lead over the last couple of laps, winning at Silverstone for the third time (the last two being consecutive British Grand Prix wins and the first from pole by any driver, since 1994). In doing so, he also surpassed Jackie Stewart's 45-year-old record of laps led in eighteen consecutive Grands Prix. Alonso finished tenth to earn his first point since his return to McLaren, while the new B-spec Force India recorded a double-point finish with Hülkenberg and Pérez in seventh and ninth respectively.\nPost-race.\nMedia reception of the race was good, with different sources calling it a \"thriller\" and \"a transfusion of fresh blood for the much-criticised sport.\" Hamilton's performance in particular was deemed \"brilliant.\" The world champion admitted that Mercedes losing their places at the start \"made the race for the fans\" and went on to say: \"You can't imagine how happy I am. I was tearing up on the last lap.\"\nFollowing the early lap fight for the lead with teammate Massa, Valtteri Bottas stated that he was sure he could have pulled a gap to the Mercedes behind. However, he insisted that \"No one should let anyone by. That's not racing, but it would have been nice to have been able to race when I had the best opportunities.\" Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner declared after the race that a spin on a damp track had allegedly cost Daniil Kvyat the chance to challenge for a podium position. Following the race, the stewards decided not to take any action regarding the first-lap incident between the Lotus and McLaren drivers.\nThe victory allowed Hamilton to extend his championship lead over Rosberg to 17 points. He also broke the record by leading at least one lap in 18 consecutive races. By placing two drivers on the podium for the ninth time in a row, Mercedes equalled a record set by Ferrari over the course of the – seasons, albeit whilst often racing with more than two cars.\nA day after the race, a small controversy surfaced in the media in relation to the Mercedes team allegedly breaking the rules by causing its mechanics to rush to the pit lane on lap 14, for a stop that never eventuated. Stirred by text messages from Susie Wolff to her husband, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, the latter publicly conceded that the incident was \"a bit of a game\" that failed to cause Williams to call its cars in the pit lane early. While no sanctions followed, FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting responded by deciding to warn all teams against this practice at the subsequent ."

        "title": "2015 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2015 Italian Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Gran Premio d'Italia 2015) was a Formula One motor race held on 6 September 2015 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Monza, Italy. The race was the twelfth round of the 2015 season, and marked the 85th running of the Italian Grand Prix.\nLewis Hamilton of Mercedes was the defending race winner, and entered with a 28-point lead over teammate Nico Rosberg in the Drivers' Championship, with Sebastian Vettel a further 39 points behind. Mercedes lead the Constructors' Championship by 184 points over Ferrari, with Williams a further 81 points behind in third.\nHamilton completed the second grand slam of his career by winning the race, taking pole position, setting the fastest lap and leading every lap of the race. He finished 25 seconds ahead of Vettel, while Felipe Massa finished third for Williams. Rosberg retired with three laps to go due to an engine failure, resulting in Hamilton extending his lead in the Drivers' Championship to 53 points. Hamilton's victory was confirmed a few hours after the race following an investigation from race stewards after it was discovered that the left-rear tyre on his Mercedes was below Pirelli's recommended minimum tyre pressure standards in a random check but due to procedural inconsistencies, no sanctions were imposed against either Mercedes driver or the team.\nThis race marked the 41st and final podium finish for World Championship runner-up Felipe Massa.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound, as opposed to the previous year where the company brought the hard compound as the prime and medium compound as the option. Sauber's Head of Track Engineering, Giampaolo Dallara, praised the updated choice, summing up that it will challenge teams to make time in the corners in addition to going for pure top speed, putting on a better show for the fans. However, Pirelli had received criticism from several drivers and commentators following tyre failures on Nico Rosberg's and Sebastian Vettel's cars at the Belgian Grand Prix. Prior to the Italian Grand Prix, Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone called for the drivers to keep their concerns to themselves, saying: \"We’re not going to let them [Pirelli] go. They're doing a good job.\"\nThe Lotus team, who had their cars impounded by bailiffs following Belgium two weeks earlier, managed to get their cars back in time for the Grand Prix. Despite their financial troubles, the team said it had enough funds for the rest of the season. Meanwhile, contract negotiations were high in the agenda prior to the weekend, with Williams announcing that the team would retain Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas for , while Nico Hülkenberg signed a new two-year deal with Force India. An additional talking point was the future of the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, with the event at risk to be dropped from the calendar. After the race, Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel spoke out in favour of the venue, saying: \"If we take this race away from the calendar for any shitty money reasons, you are basically ripping our hearts out\".\nIn terms of technical developments, Ferrari upgraded their engine for their home race by using three of their development tokens while Mercedes spent all seven of their remaining engine tokens. As a result of this, Mercedes became the first team in 2015 to use all their tokens, with both Honda and Ferrari having four tokens remaining and Renault having twelve tokens left for later in the season. Because of these changes both Mercedes cars were on their third powerplants, whilst both Ferrari cars were on their fourth power units. Additionally, Toro Rosso, Red Bull and McLaren received grid penalties for exceeding their parts usage, forcing them to start at the back of the grid. McLaren went back to using their snub nose design, which they had replaced earlier in the season ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix, in order to achieve better aerodynamics and lower drag for the high-speed Monza circuit.\nPrior to the race, Lewis Hamilton was leading the World Championship on 227 points, 28 clear of teammate Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel was in third place, another 39 points adrift. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes were in front on 426 points, with Ferrari and Williams second and third on 242 and 161 points respectively.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; there were two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. In what \"The Guardian\" described as an \"as dominant as ever\" performance, Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton lead the times in both practice sessions on Friday, with Nico Rosberg in second on both occasions. During the first session on Friday morning, Hamilton led his teammate by half a second, with Sebastian Vettel in third, another full second behind. Daniel Ricciardo was the fastest driver in a Renault-powered car, and trailed Hamilton by more than two seconds. Jolyon Palmer again replaced Romain Grosjean in the Lotus during the first practice and ended the session half a second off his teammate's pace in fifteenth. Carlos Sainz Jr. briefly brought out a red flag when he got stuck in the gravel after spinning out at Parabolica.\nAt the second practice session on Friday afternoon, Ferrari was able to reduce the gap to Mercedes, with Vettel third a little more than seven-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. Nico Rosberg was just 0.021 seconds off his teammate's time of 1m24.279s, even leading through the first two sectors but losing fastest time through the third and final sector. The two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg split the two Ferrari drivers, with Kimi Räikkönen finishing in sixth. Max Verstappen was the second Toro Rosso driver of the day to spin out into the gravel, but he was able to continue after losing control of his car at the Ascari chicane. There were technical problems for both Daniel Ricciardo and Jenson Button. While the Australian had to cut his first run short due to a hydraulical issue, Button was summoned back into the pit lane after only three laps with an unspecified problem.\nIn the third session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton once more finished fastest, but this time it was Sebastian Vettel in second, 0.264s behind Hamilton's time of 1m24.544s. The session started on a slightly wet track caused by rain over the night, but it soon dried up. Ricciardo's session was marred by another technical problem, this time an engine failure to his newly equipped power unit. His teammate Daniil Kvyat did not have a productive session either as he spent most of the time in the garage, setting only seventeenth best time.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg was one of the first out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able to get out and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.\nDuring the first timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now a little more than a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.\nWhen Q3 was contested by the top ten drivers, Nico Rosberg was the first to set a time, but Hamilton immediately went faster, setting a time of 1:23.397, which eventually secured him pole position. Again, both Ferrari drivers went faster than Rosberg, being about three-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. During the last timed runs, Räikkönen moved ahead of Vettel to qualify on the front row, while Rosberg improved his time, but stayed in fourth on the grid. He would later refer to his old power unit as the main reason for his qualifying performance. Nico Hülkenberg posted a time good enough for ninth, but his car came to a halt at the pit lane entrance, after his team had miscalculated the fuel put into his car. The two Williams of Massa and Bottas qualified fifth and sixth respectively, with Hülkenberg's teammate Pérez behind them in seventh, ahead of Romain Grosjean. Marcus Ericsson rounded up the top ten, but was later dropped to twelfth on the grid for impeating Hülkenberg in Q1. It was Hamilton's eleventh pole position in twelve races in the season so far.\nToro Rosso's Max Verstappen was handed a drive-through penalty to be served within the first three laps of the race due to an unsafe pit release during qualifying. Kimi Räikkönen expressed delight with his front row performance, saying that the team was surprised by the strong result and calling it \"our best qualifying of the year as a team\".\nRace.\nAs the race got under way, Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari remained motionless on the spot and only started after all other cars had passed the Finn. Meanwhile, Hamilton got through the first chicane in front of Vettel, but his teammate Rosberg had to avoid Räikkönen's car and lost two places to the two Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Both Lotus drivers were forced to retire before the end of the second lap, Grosjean due to contact with another car, while Maldonado damaged his chassis when he went over a kerb. While Räikkönen charged through the field to get back up to twelfth place by lap three, Lewis Hamilton quickly increased his advantage over Vettel and moved out of the one-second DRS window. Nico Rosberg was unable to pass Bottas on track and was told by his team to cool his brakes. Further back, the Red Bull sponsored cars moved up the order as well, with Carlos Sainz Jr., Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat fighting for tenth position. Sainz yielded his place on lap 11, when he needed to go into the pit lane for a five-second penalty handed to him for cutting the chicane at the start. By lap 14, Hamilton led Vettel by over eight seconds, with Rosberg still behind both Williams in fifth place, pushing Bottas by enabling DRS on the long straights. Behind the German were the two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg.\nOn lap 18, Rosberg was the first of the front runners to come in, attempting to \"undercut\" the two Williams, who were forced to pit shortly after. Massa came in a lap later and Bottas on lap 22, both emerging from the pit lane behind the Mercedes of Rosberg, who was now third. By lap 26, both Hamilton and Vettel had made pit stops as well, as Hamilton was leading the Ferrari by more than twelve seconds. By that point, Räikkönen, who had yet to stop, was in third place but easily overtaken by Rosberg on lap 28. On lap 29, Daniel Ricciardo, also still on his original tyres, moved past Pérez into sixth position, only for the Mexican to retrieve it a lap later. At the end of lap 29, Räikkönen made a pit stop but almost collided with Roberto Merhi at the pit entrance. After his stop, the Finn emerged tenth, but quickly moved up the order again, taking eighth from Marcus Ericsson on lap 32. By lap 36, Nico Rosberg had moved within four seconds of Sebastian Vettel in front of him, while Räikkönen moved into seventh at the expense of Nico Hülkenberg.\nBy lap 45, Vettel and Rosberg encountered backmarkers on track, which allowed Rosberg to move closer to his compatriot, trailing him by less than three seconds. On lap 49, Mercedes told Hamilton to increase his speed, without giving the driver an explanation. With Hamilton leading Vettel by 23 seconds, the call came unexpected. It later proved to be caused by the fact that Hamilton's left rear tyre had too little pressure at the start, leading the team to fear for a time penalty after the race. Fernando Alonso retired from the race on lap 50 due to loss of power. One lap later, Räikkönen moved into sixth place by overtaking the Force India of Sergio Pérez. With one lap to go, Rosberg was moving ever closer to Vettel in front, when his engine failed, forcing him to retire, handing Felipe Massa the final spot on the podium, who defended the position from teammate Bottas over the final lap. Lewis Hamilton finished the race to take victory on what he himself described as \"the best [weekend] I've ever driven\". He finished more than 25 seconds ahead of Vettel with a grand slam of pole position, fastest lap, win, and every lap led.\nPost-race.\nFor more than two hours after the race, Hamilton's victory was still up for debate, as his left rear tyres was found to have had 0.3 psi less tyre pressure than regulated. While Lewis Hamilton stated in the post-race press conference that he had not been aware of the issue, Williams officials Pat Symonds and Rob Smedley called for Hamilton's disqualification, with the latter pointing out that it was \"a safety issue\". The stewards eventually decided not to take any further action, stating the following: \"In making this determination regarding the pressure, the stewards noted that the tyre warming blankets had been disconnected from their power source, as is normal procedure, and the tyres were significantly below the maximum permitted tyre blanket temperature at the time of the FIA's measurement on the grid and at significantly different temperatures from other cars measured on the grid. Further, the stewards are satisfied that the team followed the currently specified procedure, supervised by the tyre manufacturer for the safe operation of the tyres. Therefore, the stewards decide to take no further action.\"\nAt the podium interview, conducted by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his team and the fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: \"I'm getting old for that! I even said to the team I'm getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here.\" During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since he had not been made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: \"I think it's not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn't know what's going on [...]. In a lot of respect and fairness he did a very good job today and you have to accept that.\"\nFollowing the race, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that Mercedes had made a \"worrying step forward\" with their new engine specification, admitting that the team was \"in a league of their own at the moment\". Nico Rosberg, who had raced with the old specification version of the power unit, described the race as a \"massive step in the wrong direction\". After the race, the team revealed that they had turned his engine up in order to help him catch Vettel in the closing stages. The team later admitted that using the new power unit at the Italian Grand Prix had been \"a risk\".\nAs a result of the race, Lewis Hamilton extended his lead in the championship to 53 points over teammate Rosberg. His second-place finish meant that Sebastian Vettel moved closer to Rosberg, now trailing him by 21 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Mercedes now led the field on 451 points, with Ferrari and Williams in second and third, on 270 and 188 points respectively."

        "title": "2015 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2015 Singapore Grand Prix (formally known as the 2015 Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 20 September 2015 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. The race was the thirteenth round of the season. It was the eighth time the race was run as a round of the Formula One World Championship.\nDefending race winner Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes entered as the leader in the World Drivers' Championship with 252 points, 53 points ahead of teammate Nico Rosberg and 74 points ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes came into the race leading the Constructors' Championship by 181 points ahead of Ferrari, with Williams a further 82 points back in third place.\nVettel won the race from pole position, ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in second and Vettel's Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen in third. The Mercedes team struggled at Singapore; Lewis Hamilton recorded his first retirement of the season, while Nico Rosberg managed only fourth place, closing the gap in the championship to 41 points.\nThis is the only Grand Prix in the 2015 season where Mercedes did not secure a pole position, with their drivers qualifying fifth and sixth.\nReport.\nBackground.\nComing to Singapore, Nico Rosberg was forced to change his power unit after his engine failure at the previous race in Italy. Using his fourth unit of the season, Rosberg was one power unit change away from a possible grid penalty. Alexander Rossi made his Formula One debut after signing a five-race deal to replace Roberto Merhi at Manor Marussia. Acting as race stewards at the Grand Prix were Garry Connelly from Australia and Vincenzo Spano from Venezuela, who assisted driver steward Martin Donnelly in his first appearance in this position since the 2014 Malaysian Grand Prix. Sauber brought a \"heavily-updated car\" to the Grand Prix, featuring a shorter nose and revised front and rear wings as well as a new engine cover and brake ducts. Toro Rosso also came to Singapore with new parts, bringing a revised front wing. Red Bull introduced a new component as well: Daniil Kvyat's car was equipped with new turning vanes installed to improve the airflow under the car and therefore create more downforce. The feature would be run by both cars at the following Japanese Grand Prix. Further updates included changes to the diffuser, rear wing, brake ducts and bodywork of the Force India VJM08B and modifications to the floor in front of the rear wheels of the Ferrari SF15-T.\nThe FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still turned right at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven down the length of Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.\nAs in the previous year's event, and third season in a row, Pirelli, Formula One's sole tyre supplier, brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded supersoft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre, as well as the green-banded intermediate weather and the blue-banded full-wet weather compounds.\nWith forest fires continuing to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog was a concern for the event. Unhealthy levels forced the cancellation of other events in Singapore in the week leading up to the Grand Prix. Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was also under threat of cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.\nComing into the race weekend, Lewis Hamilton was leading the Drivers' Championship with 252 points, 53 points ahead of Nico Rosberg, his teammate at Mercedes. Another 21 points behind in third was Sebastian Vettel, driving for Ferrari. In the Constructors' Standings, Mercedes were leading on 451 points, followed by Ferrari and Williams with 270 and 188 points respectively.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; there were two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. Since Singapore was a night race, the practice sessions started at a later local time; 18:00 for the first and 21:30 for the second session on Friday. This meant that the gap between the first two practice sessions was half an hour shorter than in other races. The two Mercedes cars were fastest in the first session on Friday, with Nico Rosberg topping the time sheets at 1:47.995. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second, 0.319 seconds behind, while Daniel Ricciardo was 0.017 seconds slower in third, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen, even though Vettel briefly left the track in turn five towards the end of the session. While Ricciardo felt he could go even faster, his teammate Daniil Kvyat was able to put in only eight laps due to a fuel system problem, and he finished the session eighteenth, just ahead of the two Manor Marussia drivers. Manor's Alexander Rossi placed last, albeit close to teammate Will Stevens, before crashing out at turn 18, ending the last timed runs of all other drivers left on track.\nEarly on in practice two, Will Stevens became the second Manor driver to make contact with the barriers, damaging his car. Teammate Rossi was limited to only three laps of running as his team spent most of the session repairing the damage from the shunt in first practice, he eventually finished almost 14 seconds down on Daniil Kvyat, who topped the session with a time of 1:46.142. The second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo finished third, with Räikkönen in between the two. Hamilton was the fastest Mercedes driver in fourth, while Rosberg managed only seventh fastest, behind Sebastian Vettel and Sergio Pérez. Fernando Alonso finished eighth for McLaren, also within a second of Kvyat. However, his teammate Jenson Button, who was 14th with a detuned power unit, still expressed disappointment at the team's pace, saying he had hoped the car to be better. Several drivers made minor contact with the walls on the narrow Singapore circuit, including Pastor Maldonado and Carlos Sainz Jr., who suffered a left-rear puncture after hitting the wall at turn five. After the performances by both Red Bull and Ferrari, Lewis Hamilton expected a \"genuine challenge\" from both teams over the rest of the weekend. Meanwhile, both Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel were less optimistic. While Ricciardo said he was \"still not looking to them [Mercedes]\", Vettel felt that Mercedes \"looked a bit slow but I'm sure they will change it for tomorrow\".\nIn the third practice session on Saturday evening, the two Ferraris were in front, with Vettel fastest at 1:45.682, while Räikkönen was almost half a second off his teammate's pace. The two Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo were behind, followed by both Mercedes cars, who trailed Vettel by more than a second. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso continued McLaren's good form and finished seventh fastest. Lewis Hamilton had several problems during the session; an early run was interrupted by him leaving the track and he was later called to drive through the pit lane to cool down his overheating car. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest Williams driver in eleventh, just in front of Nico Hülkenberg, who drove a revised version of his Force India. The two Manor Marussia cars were again last, with Rossi almost three seconds ahead of Stevens.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), only the Ferrari were confident enough to run only on the slower, harder tyres, while the rest of the field needed to equip the super-soft compound. Daniil Kvyat topped the session with a time of 1:45.340 on the supersoft tyre. Pastor Maldonado was eliminated, as were the two Manor Marussia drivers, who were even further off the pace than usual. Both of the team's drivers received a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. Both Sauber drivers also did not make it into Q2, when Jenson Button was the last to set a fast lap, edging out Felipe Nasr by less than a tenth of a second.\nVettel set the fastest time in the second part of qualifying as well, being two-tenths faster than second placed Daniil Kvyat. While Max Verstappen made it into Q3, his teammate Sainz hit the wall in turn 19 close to the end of the session, damaging his suspension and front wing, with parts of debris left on the track. With the session ending under yellow flags, both Force India and both McLaren drivers joined Sainz in elimination, with Nico Hülkenberg fastest in eleventh place on the grid. Everyone behind Sainz failed to finish their laps, including Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton.\nAt the beginning of Q3, Lewis Hamilton aborted his first fast lap. Mercedes seemed to struggle most in the final sector, where Hamilton lost half a second to the Red Bull of Kvyat. Hamilton later stated that the team had problems generating heat in the tyres, essential for the final sector that benefitted high traction. It was Sebastian Vettel who took pole position, having led the final two parts of qualifying, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, who lost time in the first sector after having to back off from Valtteri Bottas in front of him. The other Ferrari and Red Bull of Räikkönen and Kvyat claimed third and fourth on the grid respectively, followed by both Mercedes cars, who were one and a half seconds down on Vettel's pole time of 1:43.885. This was the first pole position for Ferrari since the 2012 German Grand Prix, the first in dry conditions for five years, and also prevented Lewis Hamilton from equalling Ayrton Senna's record of eight consecutive pole positions. Vettel's pole also brought an end to Mercedes's 23-race long run of pole positions, and it was the first time since the beginning of the season that the first spot on the grid was not taken by a Mercedes-powered car.\nRace.\nBefore the formation lap, Rosberg appeared to have an issue with his car, when he stopped at the end of pit lane on the way to the start grid. However, his mechanics were able to rectify the problem, described by Niki Lauda as \"a glitch\", and he made it to the grid. With everyone starting on the super-soft tyre compound, a race with two pit stops was expected for most drivers. At the start, all drivers at the front of the field held their positions, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg, who had a good start, and Sergio Pérez nearly collided while fighting for position. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso STR10 stalled on the grid and was pushed back to the pit lane, only to start his race shortly after, more than one lap down on the leaders. Vettel was able to build a gap to Ricciardo behind him quickly, leading the Red Bull by three seconds after the first lap. Fernando Alonso, who had enjoyed a decent start to move up into eleventh, came under pressure from Sainz by lap four, followed by Grosjean, who lost places at the start because he had to move around the stationary Verstappen. While Vettel's lead was about five seconds on lap five, Verstappen unlapped himself by lap six and posted fast lap times. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg held off the two Williams cars of Bottas and Massa, while Lewis Hamilton in front was able to move clear of the pack fighting for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen in third place was held at a distance by Ricciardo, trailing him by 1.6 seconds on lap nine. A lap later, Grosjean became the first driver to pit. More cars came in on lap eleven, leading to heavy traffic that prevented Sainz and Alonso from leaving their pit boxes, costing time. Alonso emerged from pit lane ahead of Grosjean, who moved past him into thirteenth. Felipe Massa had a slow stop of 4.8 seconds when he made a pit stop at the end of lap 13. When he emerged from pit lane, Nico Hülkenberg was approaching on the racing line. Both drivers collided, with Hülkenberg being catapulted off Massa's front right tyre, causing him to retire from the race. A Virtual Safety Car period ensued, that saw all drivers pit that had not done so before. Since Kvyat had made a pit stop shortly before the safety car was deployed, both Mercedes cars were able to move in front of him, leaving Kvyat in sixth place. Jenson Button's stop took a long time, dropping him to 16th place. By lap 16, the virtual was replaced by the actual safety car, which stayed out until the end of lap 18.\nAt the restart, Sainz was caught out by his car being stuck in neutral, losing many places and dropping back to 18th position, but managed to continue. The safety car had meanwhile allowed his teammate Verstappen to move closer to the pack, being about half a lap down on lap 20. The next laps saw Vettel setting a steady pace at the front to conserve his tyres, leading Hamilton to declare that \"Vettel's backing up Ricciardo\" on team radio. On lap 26, Hamilton reported a loss of power to his crew. He subsequently lost positions rapidly, dropping back to ninth by lap 28, eventually retiring on lap 33. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa had problems with his car as well. Similar to Sainz, he saw his car switch to neutral. After driving through pit lane without stopping on lap 30, he retired a lap later, with Fernando Alonso also ending his race on lap 34 with a defective gearbox. On the same lap, Daniil Kvyat came in for his second pit stop, but trouble with the tyres caused him to lose positions as he dropped to ninth. Around the same time, Vettel held a five-second advantage over Ricciardo, while Pérez overtook Grosjean for ninth on lap 36.\nA second safety car period was caused on lap 37 by a man walking on the track. Several drivers again used the safety car to pit for new tyres, including Jenson Button, who emerged in tenth place. By lap 40, Alexander Rossi was instructed to unlap himself behind the safety car, but when he failed to do so in an acceptable time, the race was resumed on lap 41, with Rossi stuck between the front runners. By lap 42, Button was racing Pastor Maldonado for position, when both collided in turn 15, damaging Button's front wing, who was forced to pit to have it exchanged. Button rejoined in 14th place, telling his team on the radio \"I should have known, really, that he's mental\", speaking about Maldonado. By lap 45, Max Verstappen, who had started more than a lap behind, was up to ninth and set the new fastest lap of the race. One lap later, he took eighth place from Grosjean. His teammate Sainz followed two laps later, with Grosjean complaining that Sainz had left him \"nowhere to go\". Meanwhile, at the front, Ricciardo set a fastest lap on lap 51, being 2.9 seconds behind leading man Vettel. Lap 53 saw Jenson Button become the second McLaren to retire, suffering from a gearbox issue as well. During the closing stages of the race, Valtteri Bottas in fifth experienced gearbox problems of his own, but was able to continue. On lap 60, Grosjean ran wide and let Felipe Nasr move through into the final point scoring position, tenth. During the last lap, Toro Rosso instructed Verstappen to let his teammate Sainz pass him for eighth, but Verstappen refused and stayed in place. Sebastian Vettel crossed the line to win the race, which took the entire allowed span of two hours.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Sebastian Vettel described the race as one of his best ever, calling it \"a great day; we had a really great weekend\". He also revealed that his drink bottle had failed halfway into the race, causing him to become thirsty as drivers lose two to three litres in sweat during the Singapore race. Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that an \"undercut\", overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible had it not been for the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he \"saw him taking a picture\" and continued: \"I hope it was a good one at least. I hope it was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him. It was crazy, obviously [...].\" The intruder was later revealed to be 27-year-old British citizen Yogvitam Pravin Dhokia. He appeared in court on the Tuesday following the race and was offered a bail of , which he was unable to pay. He was later sentenced to serve six weeks in jail.\nStill during the race, the stewards handed Nico Hülkenberg a three-place grid penalty for the following race in Japan for causing the collision with Felipe Massa on lap 14. Hülkenberg was \"frustrated\" with the decision, saying: \"The accident with Felipe was very unlucky and I don't understand why I've been given a penalty before there has even been the chance to discuss the incident in the stewards' room [...] In my view it was my corner and I'm surprised Felipe backed out of it much too late, locking up just before he hit me.\" Massa had a different view about the incident, stating: \"I was braking for the corner and he turned his car in on mine, leaving me with nowhere to go, so we hit.\" Force India decided not to appeal the decision. Williams's Head of Vehicle Performance Rob Smedley lamented the slow pit stop of his team that preceded the incident, saying that Massa should have exited the pit lane safely ahead of Hülkenberg. While initial reactions in the United Kingdom agreed with the stewards' decision, German tabloid \"Bild\" called the penalty a \"joke\". Hülkenberg later accepted that he was at fault and apologised to Massa via text message. Concerning the accident between Button and Maldonado, no further action was taken by the stewards. Jenson Button however followed up on his \"mental\"-remark during the race, by stating that he felt Maldonado's driving was \"very strange\" and that he \"won't ever change\". Maldonado answered by saying: \"No driver's happy if there's a car in front of them and they want to get past, especially if it damages their car trying to overtake [...]. We both got damage to our cars; he was behind me trying to get past, I was defending my position. That's racing.\"\nFollowing the controversial refusal by Max Verstappen to follow team orders and let his teammate pass in the final lap of the race, team principal Franz Tost later backed up his driver: \"The team wanted to swap positions because we thought Carlos was faster with the new tyres, but this was not the case, he could not catch up. He was too far away, so Max said no, and he was right.\" The Ferrari team came under criticism after the race, when team personnel broke through a barrier by security to enter \"parc fermé\" and celebrate Vettel's victory. The team announced that they intended to \"send a written unconditional apology\" to the Grand Prix officials and security staff over the incident.\nAs a result of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's retirement saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race would prove to be the only one that Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season."

        "title": "2015 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2015 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the 2015 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 27 September 2015 at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Japan. The race was the fourteenth round of the World Championship, and marked the forty-first running of the Japanese Grand Prix.\nLewis Hamilton entered the race as the defending winner of the Grand Prix and Drivers' Championship leader with a 41-point lead over his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel came into the event eight points further back in third. Mercedes led the Constructors' Championship over Ferrari by 153 points, with Williams a further 110 points behind Ferrari.\nHamilton won the race, having overtaken Rosberg at the start, who fell back to fourth, but recovered to finish second. Rosberg's deficit in the Drivers' Championship therefore increased to 48 points. Sebastian Vettel finished third for Ferrari. This was the first race in which all cars were classified as finishers since the 2011 European Grand Prix, which would not be replicated again until the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix.\nReport.\nBackground.\nFor the third year in a row, Pirelli opted to bring its two hardest dry weather compounds for this event, the orange-banded hard compound as the \"prime\" selection, while the white-banded medium tyre used as the \"option\" selection. The two wet-weather tyres, the green-banded intermediate and blue-banded full wet tyres, were also available to use as they are at all events. Pirelli cited the nature of the track and the high lateral energy loads experienced in the corners, in particular 130R – typically taken at full throttle and top speed in dry weather racing – as reasons for the hardest tyres being used. The suppliers expected a performance difference of 0.6–0.8 seconds per lap between the compounds.\nThe Japanese Grand Prix was one of only two events in the 2015 season to have only one drag reduction system (DRS) zone, the other being Monaco. The DRS zone at Suzuka was in its traditional spot, on the start/finish straight between turn 18 and turn 1, with the detection point just before the Casio Triangle complex.\nForce India driver Nico Hülkenberg served a three-place grid penalty following qualifying after being deemed at-fault for a collision with Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix in order to improve the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing endplate, while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.\nThis was the first running of the Japanese Grand Prix after Jules Bianchi's crash at the previous edition, which proved fatal when Bianchi succumbed to his injuries nine months following the accident. The Manor Marussia team announced that they would mark the occasion in a \"very private way\". In the wake of the accident, the \"Dunlop\" corner was slightly changed and revised in safety standards, and the organisers of the Japanese Grand Prix installed a large crane in place of the tractor that Bianchi hit. The Lotus team's equipment arrived late in Suzuka, while team members were also kept from entering their hospitality unit after cash-flow problems caused the unit not to be paid for in time.\nGoing into the weekend, Lewis Hamilton was leading the World Drivers' Championship on 252 points, 41 ahead of his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari was 8 more points behind on 203, followed by Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas on 107 and 101 points respectively. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes was leading Ferrari by 153 points, with Williams an additional 112 points behind in third.\nFree practice.\nPer the regulations for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held; there were two 90-minute sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. In first practice, Carlos Sainz Jr. set the fastest time with a 1:49.434 in rainy conditions, about half a second ahead of second placed Daniil Kvyat. Eight drivers chose not to set a time, with complaints about aquaplaning in the later stage of the session. The first fifty minutes of the session saw most drivers only drive installation laps. While the first timed laps were set on full wet tyres, the two Williams cars were the first to go out on intermediate tyres. Nico Rosberg ran with the power unit that he had used briefly at the before it was changed due to a coolant leak. He switched back to the one he used in the previous race in Singapore for the rest of the weekend. Jolyon Palmer again took over for Romain Grosjean at Lotus, but he did not set a timed lap.\nWhile the rain had stopped at the beginning of the second session, the track was still damp and all drivers initially ran on intermediate tyres. Daniil Kvyat eventually set the fastest time at 1:48.277, just 0.023 seconds ahead of Nico Rosberg, with Lewis Hamilton in third, half a second down on Kvyat. Sebastian Vettel set the fifth fastest time while driving the most timed laps of the session at nineteen. Sainz, fastest in first practice, heard \"strange noises\" from his power unit, but eventually finished seventh fastest. Felipe Massa was the only Williams driver to run, as Valtteri Bottas saved wet-weather-tyres. After more than half an hour, more rain fell and a number of drivers went out to get more running on the full-wet tyres. This included Fernando Alonso, who had been forced to wait forty minutes to start his running due to an unspecified issue with the power unit.\nThe third session on Saturday was held in dry conditions. The two Mercedes drivers Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton set the fastest times, with Rosberg being about three-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton. Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo was third, half a second down on Rosberg's 1:33.995 lap time. Kvyat in the other Red Bull did not have a good session, ending up eleventh fastest after running wide at both Spoon and the Degner corners. Behind Ricciardo, the Williams cars led the two Ferrari drivers in a session where drivers did a lot of laps to make up for the limited running on Friday.\nQualifying.\nQualifying consisted of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted towards the end, when Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso came to a halt at the hairpin, preventing a number of drivers from improving on their lap times. Marcus Ericsson, whose first timed lap had been hampered by a spin, was one of the affected drivers and was eliminated in 17th place. Jenson Button also did not make it into Q2. While his second run was also affected by Verstappen, he lost time in his first due to a failure of communication concerning his engine mode. Also eliminated were the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr and both Manor Marussia cars.\nJust as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set the fastest times in Q2 as well. Verstappen was unable to continue and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said his lap was likely the best he had ever driven at the circuit.\nThe top ten drivers contested Q3 for pole position and it was the two Mercedes drivers who set the fastest times once more, with Rosberg beating teammate Hamilton by only 0.076 seconds. Valtteri Bottas put his Williams in third while Massa lost fourth on the grid to the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel due to a mistake towards the end of the lap. Behind Massa, Kimi Räikkönen took sixth place with what he described as an \"average\" lap. The positions remained unchanged as the drivers were prevented from setting better lap times, when Daniil Kvyat crashed into the barriers at turn ten, bringing out the red flag. He had touched the grass and over-corrected, and his car rolled over on impact, but Kvyat was unharmed. With only 36 seconds of the session remaining after the red flags were lifted, it was impossible to set new fast laps. Lewis Hamilton was disappointed, since he had been one and a half tenths up on his teammate on his second fast lap when the red flags came out.\nRace.\nAt the start of the race, Lewis Hamilton was able to pass teammate Nico Rosberg, who had less power available due to a temperature problem. Rosberg lost two more positions to Vettel and Bottas going into turn two, as he \"had to avoid collision\" with Hamilton. Further back, Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa touched, resulting in punctured tyres for both drivers, with Sergio Pérez also having to go into the pit lane with a puncture. Hamilton led Vettel by 1.6 seconds after the first lap, increasing his advantage over the next couple of laps. Alonso, who had moved up the order at the start, lost ninth position to Sainz on lap four. Meanwhile, Rosberg tried to pass Bottas for third, but was told to hold off as his engine was overheating. By lap eight, Daniil Kvyat had moved up into 15th position, having started from the pit lane. Fernando Alonso was the first to come into the pit lane for a scheduled stop on lap nine. By lap eleven, Rosberg was told to resume his attempts to overtake Bottas, who in turn went into the garage for his first stop, rejoining in sixth place.\nSebastian Vettel was the next one of the front runners to pit, coming in on lap 13, while teammate Kimi Räikkönen followed a lap later. Rosberg made a pit stop on lap 15 and emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him two laps later. Meanwhile, Hamilton went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 16. By lap 18, Hamilton was leading Vettel by 8.1 seconds, with Rosberg a further 3.8 seconds behind. Max Verstappen entered the point scoring ranks with a pass on Fernando Alonso into turn one on lap 26. Two laps later, his Toro Rosso teammate Sainz damaged his front wing when hitting a bollard on his way into the pit lane, leading to a front wing change.\nAt the second round of pit stops, Räikkönen managed to get ahead of Bottas, who made pit stops simultaneously with Nico Rosberg on lap 29. Another two laps later, Vettel made a pit stop and emerged behind Rosberg, who claimed second, about ten seconds down on Hamilton, who made a pit stop on lap 32. Bottas was briefly challenged by the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, but Grosjean went off track on lap 33, while Will Stevens received a five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane. On lap 43, Marcus Ericsson overtook Pérez for 12th and two laps later, Verstappen moved ahead of teammate Sainz for ninth. Pérez lost another position to Kvyat on lap 45. Another lap later, Stevens went into a spin while fighting for position with Alexander Rossi, who finished ahead of his more experienced teammate for the second race in a row. By lap 49, Kvyat moved ahead of Ericsson as well to claim 13th position. Two laps from the end, Felipe Nasr became the first retirement of the race, albeit he would be classified in last, four laps behind the winner. Lewis Hamilton took victory comfortably, finishing 18.9 seconds ahead of Rosberg.\nPost-race.\nAt the podium interviews, conducted by Kai Ebel, a German TV reporter, Lewis Hamilton stressed that it was important to him to \"strike back\" after his retirement in Singapore. Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: \"Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [sic] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who have helped me get to where I am today and this team, because without them I would not be here.\" Nico Rosberg acknowledged that \"it's going the wrong way\" in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: \"Just need to try to win next time out.\" Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that \"with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day\". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: \"For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment.\" Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.\nWhile successful on track, the Mercedes team got into a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: \"I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers and a lot of Honda cars, but I don't know why [...]. Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason.\" Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a \"rookie error\" due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: \"It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do.\"\nFriction emerged at McLaren over the race weekend. Fernando Alonso publicly criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled \"GP2 engine, GP2!\" on the team radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: \"I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating when you see the other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category.\" Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: \"It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show.\" Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which \"The Daily Telegraph\" described as being a \"complete meltdown\", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: \"No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything.\" About his comments on the team radio he said: \"We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats.\"\nAs a result of the race, Hamilton extended his lead over teammate Nico Rosberg in the Drivers' Championship to 48 points, with Sebastian Vettel a further eleven points behind in third. Mercedes cemented their lead in the Constructors' standings, now leading Ferrari by 506 to 337 points, with Williams in third, an additional 129 points behind."

In 1991, the team was promoted to the top-tier level Argentine League (LNB). In the 1994–95 season, Olimpia reached the Argentine League finals, where they were beaten by Club Sportivo Independiente. \nOlimpia won its first Argentine LNB title in the 1995–96 season. The roster for that season was: Alejandro Montecchia, Walter Guiñazú, Federico Helale, Jorge Racca, Leonardo Gutiérrez, Lucas Victoriano, Sebastián Uranga, Todd Jadlow, Andrés Rodríguez, Carlos López Jordan, Alejandro Burgos, and Michael Lamont Wilson. The team's head coach was Horacio Seguí, while Jorge Racca was named the Argentine League MVP. That same year, Olimpia also won the FIBA South American League, after defeating the Brazilian Championship team S.C. Corinthians Paulista, in the final. Jorge Racca was also the MVP of that competition. The club also competed at the 1996 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup.\nNevertheless, the club then entered into a crisis, due to financial problems. By 2009, Olimpia had a debt of $1.5 million, and due to that critical situation, the basketball team disaffiliated itself from the top level Argentine League. The club was still in bankruptcy until 2017, when it finally cleared its debts."

After the games the village was converted to 746 market priced condos, 41 market-priced town homes, 250 affordable-rent apartments, 257 student dormitory units for George Brown College, office and retail units, and a YMCA recreation centre. The Athlete's Village was located in the West Don Lands along Front Street between Bayview Avenue and Cherry Street in Toronto. The development was certified LEED Gold. Five satellite villages (all hotels and university residences) were also used to house athletes that were competing in venues far from the main village.\nLayout.\nSix buildings compose the Athletes Village, five are residential mid-rise buildings and the sixth is a training facility. After the Pan Am/Para Pan Am Games, four residential towers became a Canary District housing development. The fifth became a dormitory for students of nearby George Brown College, and training facility became a YMCA, and serve as a men's hostel. The village was completed in February 2015, and cost $709 million CAD. As well, the village includes the Corktown Common park which was built a year before.\nLike the Olympic Villages provided for other games, the Athletes' Village provided in Toronto for the 2015 Pan American Games was a new construction. However, learning a lesson from the Athletes' Village provided for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, developers decided the units would not be fully completed before athletes moved in. Since the athletes were going to eat in central cafeterias the room that would eventually become the units' kitchens could serve as an additional bedroom. Hardwood, tile and carpet flooring are to be installed after the games are over. Painted concrete floors was seen as more appropriate for housing for athletes, who could mar the surface of more expensive flooring, with spiked shoes or other athletic gear.\nThe village is built on the site of former railway and industrial lands, including the William Davies Company, at one time the world's largest pork processing facility. After the meat industry moved out in the 1980s, the area was taken over by government to build a public housing project. The \"Ataratiri\" project failed in the 1990s, leaving the site mostly vacant for over ten years before the Waterfront Toronto agency was created to speed up the redevelopment of harbour lands in Toronto. The project was fast-tracked once Toronto was awarded the games, changing a twelve-year plan for redevelopment into a six-year plan."

However, with the Bruins leading the Panthers two games to one following Game 3, coach Paul Maurice opted to return Bobrovsky to the net, stating that he felt Lyon was fatigued.

        "text": "The 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, determining the national champion for the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 6, 2015, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana between the South regional champion, first-seeded Duke and the West regional champion, first-seeded Wisconsin.\nDuke narrowly prevailed against the Badgers to win their second national title in six years and their fifth overall. As of 2024, this is the last time Duke has appeared in the national championship game.\nOverview.\nThe 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game was played on April 6, 2015, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. It featured the South regional champion, the first-seeded Duke Blue Devils, and the West regional champion, the first-seeded Wisconsin Badgers. This marked the first time since 2008 that the national title game was played between two #1 seeded teams. That year, Kansas defeated Memphis 75–68 in overtime. (Memphis' participation in the tournament was later officially vacated.)\nDuke head coach Mike Krzyzewski made his ninth title game appearance and was seeking his fifth Division I Championship. Wisconsin head coach Bo Ryan made his first Division I Championship Game appearance. He previously won four Division III titles with UW–Platteville.\nThe game was the first championship game appearance for the Badgers since winning the 1941 Championship in Kansas City. The Blue Devils last made the Finals in 2010, which they won in Indianapolis. Early in the 2014–15 season, Duke played Wisconsin in the 2014 ACC–Big Ten Challenge. Duke won the game 80–70 in a battle of big men between Duke's Jahlil Okafor and Wisconsin's Frank Kaminsky.\nParticipants.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nAfter a 28–3 regular season, Wisconsin beat Michigan, Purdue, and Michigan State en route to the Big Ten tournament championship. They were rewarded with the top seed in the West Regional of the NCAA Tournament.\nFrank Kaminsky's double-double with 27 points and 12 rebounds, Sam Dekker's 20 points and Nigel Hayes' 15 points helped Wisconsin beat 16th seeded Coastal Carolina 86–72 in the second round (i.e., round of 64) of the NCAA Tournament. In the third round (i.e., round of 32), Dekker's 17 points and Kaminsky's 16 points helped Wisconsin pull away from 8th seeded Oregon for a 72–65 victory to advance to the Sweet 16 (i.e., the West regional semifinals). In the Sweet 16, Wisconsin used a 19–7 run to come back from a 53–46 deficit with 11 minutes remaining and take a 65–60 lead with five minutes remaining. Wisconsin used late free throws to deny 4th seeded North Carolina's upset bid and earn a 79–72 victory. They were led by Dekker's career high 23 points and 10 rebounds, and 19 points from Kaminsky.\nIn the Elite Eight (i.e., West regional final), 29 points from Kaminsky and another career-high 27 points from Dekker helped Wisconsin defeat 2nd seeded Arizona 85–78 in a rematch of the previous year's West regional finals. Wisconsin thus reached the Final Four in consecutive years for the first time in school history. In the Final Four, Kaminsky's second double-double of the tournament (20 points and 11 rebounds) helped Wisconsin end the overall number one seeded Kentucky's perfect season with a 71–64 victory, clinching their first appearance in the National Championship game since 1941. Kentucky had started the season 38–0, the best start in NCAA history.\nWisconsin defeated a #16, #8, #4, #2, and #1 seed — the predicted possible seeds in each round — en route to the championship game. They were the second team to accomplish this feat, the other being the 2001–02 Maryland Terrapins, who won the 2002 NCAA tournament.\nDuke Blue Devils.\nAfter a 28–3 regular season, Duke beat North Carolina State in the ACC tournament before losing to Notre Dame in the semifinals. Despite the loss, Duke was selected as the top seed in the South regional as an at-large.\nIn the second round (i.e., round of 64) of the NCAA Tournament, Duke defeated 16th seeded Robert Morris 85–56. Quinn Cook scored 22 points and Jahlil Okafor added 21. In the third round (i.e., round of 32), Duke beat San Diego State 68–49 behind 26 points by Okafor to reach the Sweet 16 (i.e., the South regional semifinals). Duke next faced off with 5th seeded Utah. A strong defensive performance limited Utah, the top three-point field goal shooting team in the Pac-12, to four-for-16 (25 percent) on three-point field goal attempts and 57 points overall. Okafor struggled against Utah's double teams, but Duke pulled away in the final minutes for a 63–57 win. Justise Winslow had a double-double, with 21 points and 10 rebounds for Duke. In the Elite Eight (i.e., the South regional final), Duke had another strong defensive performance, limiting 2nd seeded Gonzaga to two-for-10 (20 percent) on three-point field goal attempts. Point guard Tyus Jones earned six assists while committing 0 turnovers, and repeatedly scored in the lane as Duke pulled away from a 66–52 victory. Okafor, Winslow, Jones combined for 38 points. Jones earned regional Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors, as he averaged 15 points and 4.5 assists.\nIn the Final Four, Duke played 7th seeded Michigan State, surprise winners of the East regional. The Spartans jumped out to a 14–6 lead, before Duke went on a 14–2 run in which Okafor scored seven points. Michigan State went on to miss 17 of their final 20 shots, and trailed 36–25 at halftime. Duke started the second half with an 18–9 run, and the game was never very close after that. The final score was 81–61. Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points and 9 rebounds, Okafor scored 18 points, while grabbing 6 rebounds, and Quinn Cook added 17 points for Duke. Denzel Valentine scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Michigan State.\nGame summary.\nThe first half of the National Championship Game featured 13 lead changes and the two evenly matched teams traded baskets. Duke held the largest lead of the half at six points. Wisconsin did not shoot well early, but managed 11 second chance points as they erased the deficit. At the half, the game was tied 31–31, marking the first such tie since 1988. Wisconsin, which led the nation in fewest committed fouls per game, recorded just two first half fouls. Duke meanwhile committed seven fouls. Jahill Okafor sat the final 4:47 of the first half after picking up two fouls.\nWisconsin scored first in the second half and held the lead for most of the half as both Okafor and Justise Winslow spent extended periods on the bench due to foul trouble. Wisconsin's lead grew, reaching 9 points at the 13:25 mark, before Duke began to narrow the gap. Even as Wisconsin was building a lead, the foul situation was reversing itself—by the 11:43 mark, game fouls were even at 9 for each team. However, Okafor picked up his fourth foul at the 9:18 mark, sending him back to the bench.\nDuke tied the game at 54 on a Tyus Jones jumper with 7:03 remaining. Two possessions later, Duke took the lead for the first time in the second half on a Grayson Allen basket at the 5:32 mark. With 3:30 left in the game, Okafor reentered the game with Duke holding a narrow 59–58 lead. He immediately made a difference, scoring on back-to-back possessions to give Duke a 63–58 lead.\nWith 1:53 left, a loose ball went out of bounds and the officials initially ruled that Wisconsin's Bronson Koenig touched it last, awarding the ball to Duke. After a lengthy replay review, the officials announced that the call would stand, in a controversial decision. A Jones 3-pointer on Duke's ensuing possession with 1:20 remaining then made it 66–58 before Frank Kaminsky narrowed the gap to 66–61. After a failed layup by Jones on a run out, Wisconsin cut the lead to 3 on a dunk. On the ensuing possession, Duke was fouled and made both free throws. A Wisconsin miss sealed the victory and Duke won by a final score of 68–63.\nJones finished with a game-high 23 points, while Grayson Allen added 16 for Duke. Guarded by Kaminsky, Okafor was limited to 10 points on the game. Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 21 points and all players with 12 rebounds. Four other Badgers finished in double figures. Wisconsin shot 41 percent for the game, seven percent below their season average.\nAfter the game, Allen was cited as one of the main reasons for Duke's comeback and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, \"We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back.\" Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying \"There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all year, and I just feel sorry for my guys that all of the sudden a game was like that, and I think they're struggling with that a little bit.\" Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.\nMedia observers were also critical of the controversial replay review. Chris Chase of \"USA Today\" wrote that \"three highly trained officials, deemed good enough to be reffing in the biggest game of the year, disagreed with all three CBS analysts, all of Twitter and every American watching\". Sam Cooper of Yahoo! Sports was perplexed by the officials' explanation of the call that \"they just couldn't see anything.\" NCAA's head of officiating, John Adams, later stated that the officials never saw the conclusive angle and got the call wrong as a result.\nJones was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. The win elevated Krzyewski to second all-time in men's basketball championships behind John Wooden who coached UCLA to 10. It was his fifth title overall and, coincidently, third in the city of Indianapolis.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Championship Game was broadcast in the United States by CBS. Jim Nantz was the play-by-play man with Bill Raftery and Grant Hill providing on-court commentary. Greg Gumbel and Ernie Johnson Jr. were the studio hosts. Charles Barkley, Seth Davis, Reggie Miller, Clark Kellogg, Kenny Smith and Steve Smith provided studio commentary. ESPN International owned the broadcast rights outside the United States. Dan Shulman served as the play-by-play announcer for the international audience, with Dick Vitale providing commentary.\nRadio coverage in the United States was provided by Westwood One. The Championship Game was also streamed live for free on NCAA.com.\nAn average of 28.3 million watched the Championship Game on CBS, making the 2015 edition the most viewed NCAA men's basketball championship game since Arizona beat Kentucky in overtime in the 1997 contest."

        "title": "List of Lancashire County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Lancashire County Cricket Club is one of the eighteen member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Lancashire. The club was established on 12 January 1864 and has competed in first-class cricket from 1865, List A cricket from 1963 and Twenty20 cricket from 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within or close to the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" away from the club's main headquarters has diminished since the 1980s.\nOld Trafford in Manchester has played host to the club's first home fixtures in all three formats of the game; in first-class cricket in 1865 against Middlesex; in List A cricket in 1963 against Leicestershire; and in Twenty20 cricket against Yorkshire in 2003. Lancashire have played home matches at fifteen different grounds, but have played the majority of their home fixtures at Old Trafford, which also hosts Test, One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket matches. Two matches in the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy had to be played at 'neutral' venues due to Old Trafford being used for International cricket during the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for a bio-secure bubble.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Lancashire County Cricket Club (LCCC) for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by LCCC are recorded in the table. Matches not involving LCCC are mentioned in the notes. Lancashire played two home fixtures at neutral venues in the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy due to Covid Protocols and International Cricket at Old Trafford.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over three or more days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches, also known as limited overs or one-day matches, are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. England have played Test matches at Old Trafford since 1884 and the ground has also been used as the home venue for first-class teams billed as England XI, the All-England Eleven, The North, Gentlemen of the North and A. Shrewsbury's Australian Team. Other matches there have been Test Trials and internationals not involving England. Only the first-class matches played at the ground by Lancashire are included in the totals."

        "title": "Kim Seung-hyun (basketball)",
        "text": "Kim Seung-hyun (born November 23, 1978) is a South Korean retired basketball player. He played for Daegu Orions and Seoul Samsung Thunders in the Korean Basketball League and was a member of the South Korean national team.\nAlthough his heyday was short compared his counterparts, Kim left a lasting impact on the domestic game and is still regarded as one of the best point guards of his generation. He led the league in assists for four seasons, a joint record he shares with Joo Hee-jung and Kang Dong-hee, and also holds the all-time record for assists average per season; in the 2004–05 season he averaged 10.5 assists.\nEarly life.\nA native of Incheon, Kim had aspired to become a football player as football was his first sport, but switched sports after being introduced to basketball in fourth grade. He attended , one of the oldest high school basketball programs outside of Seoul. He drew attention for his creative play despite his short stature.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nKim surprised recruiters and observers by choosing Dongguk University instead of one of the \"big 3\" college basketball programs (Yonsei University, Korea University and Chung-Ang University). He drew the attention of KBL scouts for his flashy style of play and passing skills, which stood out despite Dongguk's poor results in collegiate competitions.\nProfessional.\nKim was the third overall pick of the 2001 KBL rookie draft and was drafted by Daegu Tongyang Orions. Prior to the draft, pundits had speculated that his height would be a stumbling block to him succeeding at professional level and it affected his draft ranking; ironically, the other two players picked ahead of him all had less successful careers. He was immediately integrated into the main team during the 2001–02 season, playing in 54 games. In his first full season, he took the league by storm, averaging 12.2 points and 8.0 assists. They would go on to win the KBL Championship that season. At the end of the season, Kim was voted into the Best 5 and won both the MVP and Rookie of the Year awards, an unprecedented feat that has never been repeated ever since. Together with foreign recruit Marcus Hicks and domestic stars such as Chun Hee-chul and Kim Byung-chul, the Orions became known for their offensive style which combined the players' strengths with flashy skills. It came to an end when Orions relocated to Goyang and Hicks and Chun both moved to other clubs. While his later seasons were mired by the team's poor league standings and a recurring back injury, he led the league in assists for another three seasons.\nKim did not play for the entire 2010–11 season due to a controversial lawsuit he had filed against the Orions. He had been negotiating a renewed contract for a raised salary when changes in the team's management and the KBL's rules regarding salary caps led to a disagreement which then escalated into a public spat. The new management felt that his requested figure was too high and did not match his performances. When Kim refused to back down, the management sought to nullify his contract by any legal means and Kim filed a civil lawsuit against them, the first time in domestic basketball a player has taken his own team to court. As Kim was neither able to play for his own team or transfer to another team, the KBL removed him from its list of registered players for that season, the first time such action had been taken against a player. The KBL stated that the action was taken for practical reasons and reiterated its official stance that both parties should settle their dispute privately. He dropped the lawsuit after he and the management both agreed to enter into mediation rather than engage in a protracted battle in court.\nAfter the lawsuit ended, Kim was traded to Seoul Samsung Thunders for the 2011–12 season. His final years were plagued by injury, poor form and the Thunders' poor results in the league. Furthermore, the domestic game became more defense-oriented and players with tall and large physiques were more preferred, leaving players like Kim at a disadvantage. He eventually retired at the end of the 2013–14 season.\nPlayer profile.\nAt his prime, Kim was known for his speed and passing skills despite being one of the league's shortest players, even for a point guard by current KBL standards. During an era where domestic point guards were still mainly \"pass first, score last\" players, Kim was one of the earliest point guards in the KBL to average points in the double digits while maintaining high assist averages, paving the way for a younger generation of scoring-oriented point guards such as Kim Nak-hyeon and Heo Hoon to be more accepted by the domestic basketball world. In addition to contributing points and assists, he was known for utilizing his speed and lack of height to his advantage by causing turnovers, reflected in the fact that he led the league in steals for four seasons.\nOther activities.\nKim was a cast member in the variety show \"Real Men\". In February 2017, he appeared on MBC's variety show \"King of Mask Singer\" (episode 99) as a contestant.\nKim returned to basketball and became a commentator for MBC Sports+ in 2017, covering KBL games. When KBL switched broadcasters to SPOTV, Kim moved to the new channel and continued.\nPersonal life.\nIn May 2018, Kim married actress Han Jung-won. It was reported that they had divorced in November 2021. Han later clarified that they remained friends and that the divorce was mutual."

        "text": "Thomas James Bell (July 10, 1932 – August 14, 2019) was an American football player. He played for the Army Cadets football teams from 1950 to 1954 and was the first Army player to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. He was selected as a first-team halfback on the 1954 All-America college football team.\nEarly years.\nBell was born in 1932 in The Bronx, the son of Irish immigrants. He was a star football player at the Mount Saint Michael Academy, a Catholic high school in the Wakefield neighborhood of The Bronx. He was recruited by Vince Lombardi to play football at the United States Military Academy.\nArmy football.\nBell attended the United States Military Academy and played college football at the halfback position for the Army Cadets football team from 1950 to 1954. In 1951, he led the Army backs in rushing. He was principally used as a defensive back in 1952 and returned to offense in 1953. \nAs a senior in 1954, Bell's eligibility was called into question. Bell had played on Army's \"plebe\" team in 1950, but repeated his plebe year in 1951 after failing a course. Because of the Korean War, the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) waived the freshman rule in 1951, and Bell played on Army's varsity team. The ECAC in 1953 undertook an investigation to determine whether Bell was permitted to play in his fifth year at the Academy. The ECAC ultimately issued a special ruling holding that the Academy had misinterpreted the freshman waiver rule, but had acted in good faith. Accordingly, Bell remained eligible to continue playing in the 1954 season.\nBell had his most successful season in 1954. While he had previously been regarded as a \"workhorse runner with drive and spirit,\" he developed a talent for following blockers in 1954. He ran for three touchdowns, including a 64-yard spring against undefeated Yale. He followed with an 80-yard run against Duke. Against Virginia, he rushed for a career-high 165 yards. He also excelled on defense, knocking down a pass in the end zone as time expired to preserve a 21-20 victory over Virginia. He helped lead the 1954 Army team to the No. 7 ranking in the final AP Poll, rushing for 1,020 yards on 96 carries. He was the first player in Army history to compile more than 1,000 rushing yards in a season, and his 1954 average of 10.6 yards per carry is the third highest in Army history. He also ranked third nationally in scoring during the 1954 season with 78 points on 13 touchdowns. He was selected by the Football Writers Association of America and the International News Service as a first-team halfback on their respective 1954 All-America college football teams.\nLater years.\nAfter graduating from West Point, Bell served as a pilot in the Air Force. He later worked in sales for companies, including Stanley and Ingersoll-Rand. He was inducted into the Army Athletic Hall of Fame in 2016. He died in 2019."

The two-legged confrontation \"Yenisei-STM\" will meet the Italian club \"Mogliano\" and \"Krasny Yar\" - with the Romanian club \"Timișoara Saracens\".\n2017–18.\nThe format of the Qualifying Competition remains similar to the previous season. As before, two places in the next year's Challenge Cup will be available for teams in the Continental Shield. Clubs from six countries will compete in the 2017–18 Continental Shield.\nFour representatives from the Italian Eccellenza – Pataro Rugby Calvisano, Femi-CZ Rugby Rovigo, Rugby Petrarca and Rugby Viadana – will be joined by Romania's Timișoara Saracens, RC Batumi from Georgia, Heidelberger RK of Germany and Portugal's Centro Desportivo Universitario de Lisboa (CDUL Rugby) competing in two pools of four.\nFollowing the pool stage matches, the winners of Pool A will play the runners-up in Pool B, and the winners of Pool B will play the runners-up in Pool A on a home and away basis.\nThe two clubs which advance will then play each other home and away with the winners securing a place in the Continental Shield final in Bilbao next May and also qualifying for the 2018–19 Challenge Cup.\nThe other Continental Shield finalist will be decided by a home and away play-off between Russia's Enisei-STM and Krasny Yar who have both received a bye into the knockout stage of the competition due to their participation in this season's Challenge Cup and to their success in last season's Continental Shield.\nThe winners of the Enisei-STM v Krasny Yar play-offs will go through to the Continental Shield final in Bilbao and will also qualify for the 2018–19 Challenge Cup.\nThe aim of the Continental Shield is to widen the footprint of club rugby across Europe and to give both emerging and established clubs in different territories the opportunity to qualify for the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying play-offs.\nDespite Heidelberger RK defeating Timișoara Saracens with the aggregate score of 47-41 and going into the Challenge Cup for the first time, Heidelberger RK have been disqualified from the Challenge Cup so Timișoara Saracens will replace them.\n2018–19.\nClubs from Italy, Georgia and Belgium competed in the 2018/19 Continental Shield with a place in the Challenge Cup up for grabs.\nFour sides from the Italian Eccellenza – Argos Rugby Petrarca, Pataro Calvisano, Femi-CZ Rugby Rovigo Delta and GS Fiamme Oro Rugby – were joined by Georgia's RC Locomotive Tbilisi and Belgian representatives, Belgium Rugby Barbarians XV, competing in two pools of three.\nLocomotive Tbilisi, Calvisano and Fiamme Oro from Rome were drawn in Pool A while Pool B was made up of Petrarca, Belgium Rugby Barbarians XV and Rovigo. Clubs in the same pool played one another on a home and away basis and the two pool winners played off over two legs to decide which club qualified for the 2019/20 Challenge Cup.\nA further place in the 2019/20 Challenge Cup was decided by a home and away play-off between Russia's Enisei-STM and Timișoara Saracens of Romania who are both competing in this season's Challenge Cup.\nThe aim of the Continental Shield is to widen the footprint of club rugby across Europe and to give both emerging and established clubs in different territories the opportunity to qualify for the Challenge Cup.\nThe Continental Shield, which was won for the second time by Enisei-STM in Bilbao in 2017–18, is organised by EPCR in conjunction with Rugby Europe and the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR)."

        "title": "Marcus Thornton (basketball, born 1993)",
        "text": "Marcus Alexander Thornton (born February 9, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for Lavrio of the Greek Basket League. He was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the 45th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft. Thornton completed his collegiate career at the College of William &amp; Mary (W&amp;M) in 2015 and was named the 2014–15 Colonial Athletic Association Player of the Year. Thornton spent 10 days on the NBA roster of the Cleveland Cavaliers, but never played.\nOn February 25, 2015, Thornton surpassed 2,052 career points to overtake Chet Giermak's long-standing school record. Giermak's mark stood for 65 years – the longest-lasting NCAA Division I school record in the nation at the time it was broken.\nHigh school career.\nThornton, a native of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, fell in love with basketball at an early age and was considered very talented throughout his youth. He attended Bishop McNamara High School, a perennial basketball power, not because of the sport but because of its academic reputation and its proximity to his home. He suited up for the varsity team as a sophomore but did not play, largely because he was playing behind future NCAA Division I players Talib Zanna (Pittsburgh), Rashad Whack (Mount St. Mary's), Lawrence Smith (North Carolina A&amp;T), and Jerome Couplin III, who went on to play football at William &amp; Mary (and eventually, the NFL).\nHe made the most out of his two-year varsity career at Bishop McNamara. Thornton scored 1,254 points, set the school career scoring average at 19.9 points per game, three-point field goal percentage (.430), and three-pointers made (161). He was named the Gatorade Maryland State Player of the Year as a senior after averaging 23.4 points, 4.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1.7 steals per game, all while competing in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference, the toughest high school basketball conference in the country. In his final game for Bishop McNamara, he scored a career high and school record 43 points.\nCollege career.\nThornton became the first William &amp; Mary Tribe signee to be named a Gatorade state player of the year. He chose William &amp; Mary over other schools partly because of its academic reputation and partly because of the attention then-assistant coach Jamion Christian paid him during recruitment. Although Christian ended up taking an assistant coaching job at VCU the spring before Thornton enrolled, it did not affect his decision to attend.\nThe 2011–12 season, his freshman year, saw the Tribe go 6–26 and finish third from the bottom of the CAA standings. He averaged 11.1 points, scoring 355 on the year, and was named to the CAA All-Rookie Team. He increased his scoring to 18.8 points per game in 2012–13 while he began to establish himself as a player who could create his own shot late in a possession. Thornton was named Second Team All-CAA, becoming just the second W&amp;M player to earn a second team honor in his sophomore year. After scoring 565 points that season, entered his junior year just 80 points shy of 1,000 for his career.\nThornton junior season of 2013–14 was a historic one for both himself and the team. The Tribe recorded 20 wins (20–12 overall), finished third in the CAA, and advanced to their third CAA tournament championship game in seven seasons. The Tribe lost by one point to Delaware, 75 to 74, barely missing out on the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Thornton's potential game-winning jump shot rattled off the back of the rim as time expired. He was the tournament's high scorer with 59 points in three games and was named to the All-CAA Tournament Team along with teammate Brandon Britt. His 599 total points for the season rank fifth-most in school history and Thornton became just the second W&amp;M player to be named NABC All-District 10 First Team in back to back seasons. He also became the third W&amp;M player to be named First Team All-CAA. Thornton ended the season with 1,519 career points, the most in school history for a player through his first three seasons.\nEntering his senior season, Thornton was selected by the league's coaches as the preseason CAA Player of the Year. \"Lindy's\" also chose Thornton as the league's most versatile player and its top NBA prospect. He also entered 2014–15 as the only returning All-CAA First Team player with a legitimate shot at breaking the school's scoring mark of 2,052. During the February 18, 2015 game against Northeastern, Thornton surpassed the 2,000-point mark and ended the game with 2,016. The W&amp;M mark of 2,052, set by All-American Chet Giermak, was broken by Thornton exactly one week later in a game against Towson. The school record had stood since 1950 and was the longest-standing Division I men's basketball school scoring record in the country. Thornton guided the Tribe to a 12–6 CAA record as they finished in a four-way tie for the regular season conference championship with James Madison, Northeastern, and UNC Wilmington. On March 5, Thornton was named as the 2015 CAA Player of the Year, becoming the first W&amp;M player to win it in the 32-year history of the award. He also repeated as an All-CAA First Team selection, becoming just the second W&amp;M player to earn the honor twice (joining Adam Hess in 2003 and 2004).\nFor the second consecutive season, William &amp; Mary earned a berth in the CAA tournament championship game. However, for the first time in school history, the Tribe entered the tournament as the number one seed. They went on to lose the 2015 tournament's final game to Northeastern, 72 to 61, thus ending their chance at a bid into the NCAA tournament. Thornton, however, was named to the CAA All-Tournament Team as well as being the tournament's leading scorer in both 2014 and 2015. By owning the regular season tie-breakers over the other three co-champions, William &amp; Mary earned the automatic National Invitation Tournament (NIT) bid, making the 2015 appearance their third in school history. On March 17, 2015, in the NIT's first round, Thornton scored a game-high 23 points despite the Tribe's 70–67 loss to Tulsa. Thornton finished his collegiate career having amassed 2,178 points, which is the most in William &amp; Mary history and seventh most in CAA history as of the end of the 2014–15 season. He scored 659 points in his senior season, which stands as the second most for a season in school history behind Giermak's 740. He also set the single season three-point field goals made (102) and most career games played (127 – tied) records.\nOn March 30, the Associated Press named Thornton an honorable mention All-American. He was the first W&amp;M player since 1981 (Mike Strayhorn) to earn the distinction and only the sixth overall to that point.\nProfessional career.\nNBA Draft and Summer League.\nOn June 25, 2015, Thornton was selected with the 45th overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, making him the first William &amp; Mary player ever taken in the modern draft format (two rounds; since 1989). He later joined the Celtics for the 2015 NBA Summer League and averaged 5.1 points and 1.1 rebounds in eight games.\nSydney Kings (2015–2016).\nOn July 22, 2015, Thornton signed with the Sydney Kings for Australia's 2015–16 National Basketball League season. On October 10, 2015, he made his debut for the Kings against the Cairns Taipans. In 29 minutes of action as a starter, he recorded nine points, three rebounds and three assists in an 87–63 win. On November 1, he scored a season-high 29 points on 11-of-17 shooting in a loss to Melbourne United. He appeared in all 28 games for the last-placed Kings, averaging 12.8 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game, but shot just 37.7 percent from the field and 28.1 percent on three-pointers.\nMaine Red Claws (2016).\nOn March 1, 2016, Thornton was acquired by the Maine Red Claws, the Celtics' D-League affiliate. Four days later, he made his debut for Maine in a 122–106 win over Raptors 905, recording seven points, one rebound, three assists and one steal in 15 minutes.\nConsultinvest Pesaro (2016–2017).\nOn July 30, 2016, Thornton signed a two-year deal with Italian side Consultinvest Pesaro.

On March 4, he was reported to not have his second 10-day contract offered by the Cavaliers and returned to Canton Charge. Thornton never played a game for the Cavaliers.\nÉlan Chalon (2019–2020).\nOn July 4, 2019, he has signed with Élan Chalon of the LNB Pro A.

In Test cricket, Underwood took 297 wickets, including 17 five-wicket hauls. The \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" named him one of their cricketers of the year in 1969, and in 2009 was one of the 55 inaugural members of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nUnderwood made his Test debut during the third Test of the West Indies tour of England in 1966, at Trent Bridge. His first Test five-wicket haul came in the second Test of Pakistan during their 1967 tour at Trent Bridge. Underwood's seventeen five-wicket hauls places him joint-third in a list of most five-wicket hauls by England Test players, behind Ian Botham and Sydney Barnes. By the end of his career, he had claimed five-wicket hauls in both innings of a match on three occasions, twice against New Zealand He went on to take ten or more wickets in a match on six occasions. In Tests, Underwood was most successful against New Zealand, with six five-wicket hauls. His career-best figures for an innings were 8 wickets for 51 runs at Lord's, against Pakistan in 1974.

        "text": "The 2015 IAAF Diamond League was the sixth season of the annual series of outdoor track and field meetings, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It consisted of fourteen one-day meetings, starting on 15 May in Doha, Qatar, and ending on 11 September in Brussels, Belgium. Other events were held in Shanghai, Eugene, Rome, Birmingham, Oslo, New York City, Paris, Lausanne, Fontvieille, Monaco, London, Stockholm, and Zürich. All previous venues remained on the tour, with the exception that London returned to host the second meeting in the United Kingdom, having been replaced by Glasgow during the 2014 IAAF Diamond League.\nSchedule.\nThe following fourteen meetings were included in the 2015 season:\nEvents.\nThere are 16 men's and 16 women's disciplines in the Diamond League and seven events per discipline in the season. The total prize money for each competition is US$30,000, with a winner's share of $10,000. The season winner of each discipline wins US$40,000.\nWinners.\nEvents not included in the Diamond League are marked in grey background.\nMeeting highlights.\nDoha.\nThree Diamond League records were set in Doha during the opening competition of the series. Allyson Felix of the United States won the women's 200 metres with a run of 21.98 seconds to equal Veronica Campbell Brown's time which was set during the inaugural 2010 IAAF Diamond League season. Jasmin Stowers, making her debut on the circuit, broke the women's 100 metres hurdles record with a time of 12.35 seconds – this raised her to seventh on the all-time rankings for the discipline. The third record of the evening came in the men's triple jump: Cuba's Pedro Pablo Pichardo became the first person to go beyond eighteen metres in series history, setting a national record and Diamond League best of . This placed him third on the all-time lists for the sport behind Jonathan Edwards and Kenny Harrison. The reigning Olympic champion, Christian Taylor, was runner-up and moved himself up to fourth on the all-time lists with a mark of , making the contest the first in history to feature two men going beyond eighteen metres. Among the other results, Justin Gatlin of the United States became the fifth fastest man in the history of the 100 metres with his winning time of 9.74 seconds (bettering the world record of 9.77 seconds he set in 2006, which was annulled due to a failed doping test).\nShanghai.\nAlmaz Ayana of Ethiopia gave the stand-out performance at the Shanghai Diamond League by running the third fastest women's 5000 metres of all time, finishing in 14:14.32 minutes for a Diamond League record. Mutaz Essa Barshim defeated Bohdan Bondarenko in the men's high jump with a meeting record and world-leading mark of . In addition to these two performances, there were four other world-leading marks set during the competition: Silas Kiplagat (men's 1500 m), Jairus Kipchoge Birech (men's steeplechase), Gong Lijiao (women's shot put) and Nikoleta Kyriakopoulou (women's pole vault). Kyriakopoulou's vault of was also a Greek record. Aside from Gong, Lü Huihui was China's only other home nation victor, and her winning mark of from the women's javelin throw was also a meeting record.\nEugene.\nRenaud Lavillenie continued the streak of Diamond League records by winning the men's pole vault with a mark of , raising him to joint second on the all-time outdoor lists. Wind and temperature conditions suited the sprinting events. Justin Gatlin won the men's 200 metres in a world lead 19.68 seconds, while Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won the women's 100 metres in another world lead of 10.81 seconds, sharing that time with Murielle Ahouré. Six women ran under 10.9 seconds that day, and China's Su Bingtian became the first man of Asian descent to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m. Mutaz Essa Barshim continued his high jump streak with a meet record and world lead of , while Caterine Ibargüen extended her undefeated run to 24 triple jump competitions. Genzebe Dibaba attempted to top Almaz Ayana's 5000 metres run from Shanghai: although she came up short, her winning time of 14:19.76 was the fifth fastest ever run for the distance. A total of thirteen world-leading marks and six meet records were set at the two-day competition.\nRome.\nA total of five world leading marks were set at the Golden Gala. Ethiopian male distance runners provided two of these, with Mohamed Aman winning the 800 m in 1:43.56 minutes and 17-year-old Yomif Kejelcha taking his first Diamond race victory in the 5000 m with the first sub-13-minute run of the season. Hyvin Kiyeng Jepkemoi, also in her first Diamond race win, took the women's steeplechase in 9:15.08 minutes (a personal best by more than six seconds). The more experienced Ruth Beitia topped the women's high jump with a clearance of – the 36-year-old Spaniard became the oldest woman to jump over that height. American Jennifer Simpson became the first woman under four minutes for the 1500 m that year.\nTwo meeting records were bettered in Rome. Justin Gatlin knocked one hundredth off Usain Bolt's 2012 time with 9.75 seconds in the men's 100 m. Pedro Pablo Pichardo took down two much longer-standing marks in the men's triple jump with his jump of : Jonathan Edwards 1998 meet record and also Khristo Markov's 1987 stadium record, which was the winning mark of the 1987 World Championships in Athletics. Other marks of note were Thiago Braz da Silva's South American record of in the men's pole vault and men's javelin throw national records from Kenya's Julius Yego and Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott of Trinidad and Tobago. A strong women's 100 m hurdles field was notable for high-profile failures: Olympic champion Sally Pearson fell heavily and was injured, world champion Brianna Rollins clashed a hurdle and fell, and world leader Jasmin Stowers also hit a hurdle heavily and walked to the finish.\nBirmingham.\nThe best performance at the Birmingham Grand Prix came in the men's javelin with Kenya's Julius Yego greatly improving to to break the Diamond League record and the African record. This mark was the best recorded in the discipline since 2006. There was some discussion over the validity of the throw: officials initially judged the throw to be outside the allowable sector, despite the throw going beyond the area that officials had marked out, and only was the meeting had finished did they accept Yego's effort. Another world lead and African record came in the non-standard 300 m sprint as Wayde van Niekerk won in 31.63 seconds.\nSandra Perković was the only athlete to set a meeting record, doing so in the women's discus with a mark of , improving on former Olympic champion Ellina Zvereva's 13-year-old record. Perković win made her the only athlete of the meeting to have won all Diamond races in a discipline after just five meetings, as Marvin Bracy's 100 m win erased Justin Gatlin's streak. Home athlete Adam Gemili broke the 10-second barrier for the first time in that race, becoming the sixth Briton to achieve the feat.\nOslo.\nIn poor weather conditions, there were few record performances in Oslo. Genzebe Dibaba fell short in her 5000 m world record attempt, although her winning time of 14:21.29 minutes was still the seventh fastest ever recorded at that point. The sole world-leading performance of the evening was Kaliese Spencer's 400 m hurdles win in 54.15 seconds. This brought the Jamaican to twelve points in the Diamond race. Caterine Ibargüen also reached twelve points, extending her three-year unbeaten run. No men were left unbeaten in their Diamond race due to two unexpected victories. A men's high jump billed as a contest between Mutaz Essa Barshim, Bohdan Bondarenko and Ivan Ukhov saw all finish outside the top two, as China's Zhang Guowei had his first Diamond League victory and Marco Fassinotti equalled the Italian record of . Robert Urbanek ousted his fellow Pole Piotr Małachowski to prevent him from taking three straight wins in the men's discus. In the absence of Diamond race leader Kirani James, Steven Gardiner broke the men's 400 m streak and took his first Diamond League win.\nThe greatest upset of the night came through Laura Muir in the women's 1500 m. The Briton built up a 40-metre lead to have her first major circuit win ahead of the more favoured Abeba Aregawi. Marharyta Dorozhon was another first time winner, achieving the feat in the women's javelin in an Israeli record of . The only other national record of the meet was a Belgian one of 3:51.84 minutes in the 1500 m by Pieter-Jan Hannes. Asbel Kiprop had his fourth career win at the Bislett Dream Mile, which was in its 50th anniversary.\nNew York.\nAs in Oslo, poor weather meant only one world-leading mark was recorded in New York: Francena McCorory improved the women's 400 m time to 49.86 seconds – also a meeting record. The women's field events provided two more meeting records: Christabel Nettey's clearance of brought her her first long jump win on the circuit, while Ruth Beitia and Blanka Vlašić were both clear at for a women's high jump record. Ajeé Wilson brought an end to Eunice Jepkoech Sum's run in the women's 800 m and Sandra Perković became the first athlete of the series to gather four straight wins.\nIn a non-Diamond race, Usain Bolt extended his unbeaten record in the 200 m, although his winning margin was narrow and his time over a second off his best. Wayde van Niekerk took the men's 400 m in a South African record time. Nikoleta Kyriakopoulou of Greece also set a national record, but her pole vault clearance of left her second to Fabiana Murer on count-back.\nParis.\nSix world leading marks were established in Paris. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's 100 m in 10.74 was also a meeting record, as was Jairus Kipchoge Birech's steeplechase victory in 7:58.83. Nikoleta Kyriakopoulou's women's pole vault world lead also equalled the Diamond League record of and improved her Greek record. Eunice Sum (800 m), Orlando Ortega (110 m hurdles) and Silas Kiplagat (1500 m) were the others to set world leads.\nGenzebe Dibaba and Almaz Ayana were both short again in a women's 5000 m world record attempt, although Genzebe's winning time of 14:15.21 was a new meet record. Three continental records were set at the meet: Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa ran an African record of 43.96 for the men's 400 m, France's Jimmy Vicaut was runner-up to Asafa Powell in the men's 100 m but equalled the European record at 9.86, while Evan Jager of the United States set a men's steeplechase record for the NACAC region. Jager did so despite a fall to the track at the last hurdle – a mistake that cost him the win over Birech and a certain sub-8 performance. A number of national records in athletics were also broken that day: Sergey Shubenkov improved the Russian record in the 110 m hurdles, Konstadinos Filippidis broke his nation's men's pole vault (a double for Greece in the event), Konstadinos Douvalidis equalled his Greek record in the 110 m hurdles, Selina Büchel improved the women's 800 m Swiss record to 1:57.95, and in the women's 400 m hurdles Sara Petersen and Kemi Adekoya broke their respective Danish and Bahraini records.\nTwo long-standing streaks were brought to an end at the competition. Valerie Adams, returning from surgery, lost to Christina Schwanitz in the women's shot put after having had 56 consecutive wins. Renaud Lavillenie was the favourite for the men's pole vault, but finished in fifth place and recorded his first loss in seven years at the meeting on home soil. Zuzana Hejnová won the 400 m hurdles to prevent Kaliese Spencer (who was absent) from taking a fourth straight win. One streak that did continue was that of Colombia's Caterine Ibargüen, who joined Sandra Perković as the only unbeaten athletes on the Diamond League that year.\nLausanne.\nThe Athletissima meeting saw one world leading performance: by Anna Chicherova in the women's high jump. Four meet records were improved. Christian Taylor defeated Pedro Pablo Pichardo with a triple jump of – the joint fourth best jump ever at that point. David Storl's shot put of was another meet record and the best by a European since 1988. The women's steeplechase record was bettered by Virginia Nyambura, while Keshorn Walcott set a Trinidad and Tobago national record and meet record of in the men's javelin.\nYaime Pérez had her first ever Diamond League win and in doing so brought an end to Sandra Perković's unbeaten streak in the women's discus throw. Zharnel Hughes (men's 200 m) and Shaunae Miller (women's 400 m) also had their first ever wins on the Diamond League circuit.\nMonaco.\nAt the Herculis meet Genzebe Dibaba provided the highlight with her 1500 metres world record of 3:50.07 minutes, breaking Qu Yunxia's time from the 1993 Chinese Games. The veracity of the previous record had been subject to doubt and Genzebe's time—almost two and a half seconds faster than any time set outside the Chinese Games—attracted questions in addition to plaudits. In response, she said \"I want to live my own history. I`m not interested in others or the conditions\". Nearly six seconds behind her, Sifan Hassan set a Dutch record and Shannon Rowbury ran a North American record.\nOne other Diamond League record was improved that evening, by Joe Kovacs in the men's shot put whose throw of moved him to eighth on the all-time lists and was the best throw recorded in over a decade. Though not a Diamond race, the men's 1500 m saw Asbel Kiprop move up to third on the all-time lists with a run of 3:26.69 minutes. A total of six meeting records were broken – Habiba Ghribi's 9:11.28 in the women's steeplechase, Christian Taylor's men's triple jump, and Justin Gatlin's 9.78 in the men's 100 m, were the other three marks addition to the above-mentioned performances. A total of eight world-leading performances were recorded.\nAmel Tuka (men's 800 m) and Candyce McGrone (women's 200 m) both won their first Diamond League races in personal bests, with Tuka improving over a second and a half in three races in July, breaking his own Bosnia and Herzegovina record and becoming the 11th fastest performer of all time. Following defeat at the previous leg, Sandra Perković returned for a fifth win in the women's discus."

        "title": "List of Essex County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Essex County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Essex. The club was established on 14 January 1876 and has played first-class cricket since 1894, List A cricket since 1963 and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" has diminished since the 1980s. Essex have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at 14 different grounds.\nThe club's debut home fixture in first-class cricket was played at the County Ground in Leyton against Leicestershire in 1894. This ground remained the county's headquarters and principal match venue until the end of the 1933 season and was used regularly for over 80 years. Until April 2024 it had still hosted more of the county's first-class matches than any other ground. Essex played their final match at the venue in 1977, however, since when the similarly-named County Ground in Chelmsford has hosted the majority of first-class games. The ground in Leyton has continued to be used for matches in local competitions.\nThe club's first home List A fixture took place in 1965 against Derbyshire at the Old County Ground in Brentwood. This venue had been used since the 1920s for first-class matches, but only staged two List A matches, and its use was discontinued altogether in 1969. The County Ground in Chelmsford played host to the club's first home Twenty20 fixture in 2003, against Kent, and has since hosted every one of the county's home Twenty20 matches with the exception of a single game in 2014 which was played at Castle Park in Colchester.\nEssex traditionally staged annual \"cricket festivals\" in the towns of Colchester, Ilford and Southend-on-Sea, which usually consisted of two first-class matches over the course of a week, and later incorporated one List A match following the introduction of that format. The Ilford event was abandoned following the 2002 season. The Southend festival moved from its traditional home at Southchurch Park to Garon Park in 2005, making the latter venue the county's only new home ground of the 21st century. Following the 2011 season, however, Essex discontinued the Southend festival altogether, leaving Castle Park in Colchester as the only venue regularly used by the county other than its main base in Chelmsford. The Colchester festival was not held in 2017, and all the county's home games were played at Chelmsford; the Colchester festival has remained suspended.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Essex County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2023 season. Only matches played by Essex CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. The Essex Cricket Board played four List A matches at the County Ground between 2000 and 2003, including one match against Essex. The Essex Cricket Board is a separate organisation from Essex County Cricket Club and its matches are not included in the totals. The match between the Board team and Essex CCC is excluded as the Board team were officially the home team."

He served as the University of Hartford's men's head coach from 1981 to 1992 and compiled an overall record of 128–181. Phelan oversaw the transition of the program from an NCAA Division II program into Division I. His previous coaching stops included Niagara University, Saint Francis University, and Fairfield University.\nAs a player, Phelan suited up for the Saint Francis Red Flash after a high school career at Northwest Catholic High School in West Hartford, Connecticut. He scored a Stokes Fieldhouse record 42 points in his senior season against Duquesne. Phelan was chosen in the sixth round of the 1977 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, although he never played in the league.\nAfter stepping down as Hartford's head coach in 1992, Phelan went into private consulting. He eventually became a high school athletics administrator at Farmington High School in Connecticut."

Their head coach was Tom Crean, who was in his eighth season with the Hoosiers. The team played its home games at Assembly Hall in Bloomington, Indiana, as a member of the Big Ten Conference.\nThis season marked the 40th Anniversary of the 32–0 and National Championship 1975–76 Hoosiers team, a feat still unrivaled. To commemorate the anniversary, players' jerseys featured a commemorative patch on the back of the jersey. The Hoosiers also held a public recognition of the undefeated team during halftime of the home game against Wisconsin on January 5, during which the announcement was made that a statue of the seniors and starters will be erected outside the south entrance of Assembly Hall. A new banner was also revealed honoring the '76 team as NCAA's #1 All-Time March Madness Team. Tom Abernethy and Bobby Wilkerson, two players from the team, were inducted into the IU Athletics Hall of Fame.\nIU's season-opener victory against Eastern Illinois was a milestone game, as it marked 1,000 home wins in Indiana basketball history. IU finished the regular season by winning their 22nd conference title, tying them with in-state rival, Purdue, for the most conference titles.\nIndiana finished the season 27–8 overall, 15–3 in the Big Ten to win the Big Ten regular season title outright. They received the #1 seed in the 2016 Big Ten men's basketball tournament, where they made an early Quarterfinals exit by losing to Michigan. The Hoosiers received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Indiana defeated Chattanooga and Kentucky to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the third time in five years; however, in the Sweet Sixteen they fell to the North Carolina Tar Heels, 86–101.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2014–15 Hoosiers went 20–14 overall and 9–9 in the Big Ten Conference (tying for seventh place). Much of the Hoosiers' difficulties were caused by a lack of defense and post presence. The Hoosiers improved over the 13–14 season, in which they did not appear in any postseason tournament, by being selected to play in the NCAA Tournament as a #10 seed in the Midwest region. They made an early exit as the #7 Wichita State Shockers knocked them off in the second round.\nFollowing the season, assistant coach Steve McClain was hired as the new head coach at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Tom Crean named Rob Judson, who spent the 2014–15 season as Indiana's Director of Basketball Operations, as McClain's replacement.\nPreseason.\nRecruiting class.\nOn April 4, 2015, McDonald's All-American and Jordan Brand All-Star, Thomas Bryant committed to IU. With this commit, IU landed their fifth McDonald's All-American in a row, as well as secured a 6'10\" rim-protector, which was something drastically missing from the previous season. Bryant made the announcement live on ESPN during the Dick's National Tournament.\nIn addition to the three high school recruits, Indiana received a commitment from Michigan graduate transfer Max Bielfeldt. The senior forward is eligible immediately to play for the Hoosiers.\nA late addition of junior Pittsburgh transfer, Josh Newkirk, filled IU's last 2015–16 scholarship. Due to transfer rules and rehabilitating a knee injury from May, Newkirk will sit out the '15–'16 season. He will have two remaining seasons of eligibility left.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#7D110C; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#7D110C; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#7D110C; color:white;\"| Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#7D110C; color:white;\"| Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#7D110C; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament"

The American League beat the National League 8–6, in 10 innings.\nThe host city was announced on April 6, 2015, by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred; it was the fifth All-Star Game in Washington, D.C., and the first since 1969, when the second Washington Senators hosted. It was also the first time that the Nationals had hosted the All-Star Game, and the first time that the Nationals franchise had hosted it since 1982, when the franchise played as the Montreal Expos. For the second straight year, the Houston Astros led both the American League and all of baseball in sending six All-Stars to the game.\nThe two leagues came into the game with identical 43–43–2 records and both had scored exactly 361 runs each in All-Star Game history. The game also broke a home run record, as ten home runs were hit in the game; the previous record being six. All but one run was scored by way of a home run. This is the second consecutive game the AL has won in the 10th inning.\nThe national rating for the game was 5.2, down from 6.5 in 2017.\nFan balloting.\nStarters.\nBalloting began on June 1 and ended on July 5.

        "title": "List of cricketers who have carried the bat in international cricket",
        "text": "In cricket, the phrase \"carrying the bat\" refers to a situation in which an opening batter remains not out at the end of an innings where all the 10 wickets have fallen; the other 10 players in the team have all been dismissed. It may also be used in situations where one or more of these players are unable to bat due to retiring out or causes like injury or illness, and the remaining players are dismissed. It is not used, however, in any other situation where the innings closes before all 10 wickets have fallen, such as when it is declared closed, or when the team successfully chases a set run target to win the match. A rare feat, this has happened only 72 times in international cricket spanning all three formats—Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).\nIn Tests, South African Bernard Tancred was the first cricketer to carry the bat; he made 26 runs in his team's total of 47 against England in 1889. The following year, Jack Barrett of Australia became the first player to carry the bat on debut. In the 1892 tour of Australia, England's Bobby Abel scored 132 and became the first player to score a century while carrying the bat. In 1933, Bill Woodfull of Australia set a new record by becoming the first player to perform this feat twice in Tests; he scored 73 not out during the third test of England's 1933 tour. Apart from Woodfull, five other cricketers have performed this feat more than once in their in Test careers—while Bill Lawry (Australia), Glenn Turner (New Zealand) and Len Hutton (England) have done it twice, Dean Elgar (South Africa) and Desmond Haynes (West Indies) have performed the feat on three occasions. , New Zealand's Tom Latham's 264, against Sri Lanka in December 2018, is the highest score in Test cricket by a player while carrying the bat. The Australian players have performed this feat more than any other, followed by England. In all, 49 players have carried their bats on 57 occasions in Test cricket.\nIn ODIs, there have been only 13 instances of a player carrying their bat. The first occasion was when Grant Flower made 84—in Zimbabwe's total of 205—against England in December 1994. The following year, Saeed Anwar became the first player to score an ODI century while carrying his bat; he made 103 against Zimbabwe in Harare. England's Nick Knight surpassed Anwar's score and went on to make 125 against Pakistan in 1996. , this remains a record in the ODI format. Australia's Damien Martyn and England's Alec Stewart are the only other players to score a century while performing this feat in ODIs. Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga became the first cricketer from his team to carry the bat when he made 112 against Pakistan in October 2017.\nIn T20Is, Chris Gayle was the first player to carry his bat, doing so against Sri Lanka during the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, scoring 63 runs in West Indies' total of 101. As of now, only 2 players have achieved the feat in T20Is.\nFlower became the first player to achieve this feat in two different international formats when he carried his bat in a Test match against Pakistan at Bulawayo in 1998. Since then, Anwar, Stewart, Javed Omar (Bangladesh), Gayle, Latham and Dimuth Karunaratne (Sri Lanka) have also managed this feat."

Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to field. Kumar Sangakkara (SL) moved into second place in the list of players with the most runs in ODI matches, overtaking Ricky Ponting (Aus).\nAustralia vs England.\nAustralia were put in to bat by England who won the toss. After opener Aaron Finch was dropped in the first over without having scored, Australia raced away to 52, before David Warner and Shane Watson were dismissed off consecutive balls in the eighth over. In the 11th over, the dismissal of Steve Smith left Australia at 70/3. Captain George Bailey then joined Finch and the two added 146 runs in 26 overs for the fourth wicket. Finch was run out for 135 and soon Bailey was also sent back for 55. Glenn Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh then put on 53 runs in 7 overs for the sixth wicket before Marsh fell and the Australian score read 281/6 in the 46th over. Brad Haddin came into bat at 9 and shared a partnership of 61 runs off just 27 balls with Maxwell. In the final over of the innings, Steven Finn removed Haddin for a 14-ball 31 and Maxwell for a 40-ball 66 off consecutive balls. Finn completed the hat-trick getting the wicket of Mitchell Johnson off the final ball, and Australia finished at 342/9.\nEngland's chase started with Mitchell Starc breaking the opening stand of 25, following which Marsh picked the next five wickets. England were reduced to 92/6, before James Taylor and Chris Woakes steadied the innings with a 92-run partnership. After Woakes fell for 37, Australia picked two more wickets off consecutive overs. From 195/9, England could add 36 runs for the last wicket before a controversial run out ended their innings. Taylor remained unbeaten on 98 as Australia secured a 111-run victory. Finch won the Man of the Match award for his knock.\nNew Zealand vs Scotland.\nNew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and put Scotland in to bat. Trent Boult and Tim Southee picked up two wickets each within the first five overs of the innings which left Scotland at 12/4. Both Matt Machan and Richie Berrington then scored fifties before being dismissed by Corey Anderson. Scotland's lower order offered little resistance and their innings ended in 36.2 overs at 142. Anderson and Daniel Vettori picked 3 wickets each for New Zealand.\nIn reply, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals from the start and were 66/3 in the 11th over. Kane Williamson and Grant Elliott put on 40 runs for the fourth wicket, before Williamson fell for 38. Scotland picked another three wickets in quick time to leave New Zealand 137/7 in the 24th over. Vettori scored an unbeaten 8 from 4 balls and New Zealand went on to win the match by 3 wickets. Boult was awarded the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 6-1-21-2 in Scotland's innings.\nNew Zealand vs England.\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan, after winning the toss, elected to bat first. England were bowled out for 123 in the 34th over, having lost their last seven wickets for 19 runs in eight overs. New Zealand fast bowler Tim Southee picked up 7/33 in his 9 overs, which was the third-best haul in World Cup history. Joe Root, who scored 46, was the only England batsman to show some resilience.\nNew Zealand's chase got off to a brisk start, mainly due to their captain Brendon McCullum who scored the fastest World Cup fifty reaching the landmark in just 18 balls. New Zealand had made 105 in 7 overs without losing a wicket. McCullum was dismissed off the first ball of the eighth over for 77, and the other opener, Martin Guptill also fell to the bowling of Chris Woakes in the tenth over. New Zealand consolidated the innings following this and went on to win the game by 8 wickets with more than 37 overs to spare. Southee won the Man of the Match for his bowling efforts.\nAfghanistan vs Sri Lanka.\nSri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and elected to field. Afghanistan got off to a solid start before both their openers were dismissed off consecutive overs and the score read 40/2 in the tenth over. Asghar Stanikzai and Samiullah Shenwari built a steady third-wicket partnership which was broken when Afghanistan had reached 128 in the 28th over. Following this, Afghanistan started losing wickets at regular intervals to the Sri Lankan pace bowlers before finally being bowled out for 232 in 49.4 overs. Lasith Malinga and Mathews picked 3 wickets each for Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka's innings got off to a disastrous start as both openers fell for ducks within the second over. Then in the sixth over, they lost the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara with the score at 18/3. They slipped into further trouble when Dimuth Karunaratne was dismissed in the 12th over with the Sri Lankan total still at 51. Mahela Jayawardene and Mathews then added 126 runs for the fifth wicket. Mathews was run out for 44 and Jayawardene was dismissed soon after completing his 19th ODI hundred. Thisara Perera, who came in to bat with Sri Lanka in a precarious position of 178/6, struck an unbeaten 47 from 26 balls to guide his team to a four-wicket win with ten balls to spare. Jayawardene was awarded the Man of the Match for his innings of 100 from 120 balls.\nNew Zealand vs Australia.\nAustralian captain Michael Clarke won the toss and elected to bat first. Australia got off to a brisk start, putting up 48/1 at the end of the first five overs. However, Shane Watson and David Warner were dismissed off consecutive balls with the score at 80. This triggered a collapse, with Trent Boult picking up five wickets in the first three overs of his second spell. Australia were left struggling at 106/9 at the end of 22 overs, before Brad Haddin and Pat Cummins put on 45 runs for the 10th wicket to take the Australian total to 151.\nNew Zealand started off rapidly in their chase, thanks to a 21-ball fifty from their captain Brendon McCullum who took his team to 72/1 after 7 overs. Soon after, Australia fought back picking up three wickets in five deliveries. New Zealand began rebuilding with a 52-run partnership between Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson. The partnership was broken when Anderson was dismissed by Glenn Maxwell and the score read 131/5. In the next three overs, Mitchell Starc and Cummins took four more wickets between them, leaving New Zealand at 146/9 in 23 overs. With 6 runs needed from 27 overs, Williamson struck a six off the bowling of Cummins to give New Zealand a memorable one-wicket victory. Williamson ended up with an unbeaten 45 and the Man of the Match was awarded to Boult who had figures of 5/27 in his 10 overs, including three maidens. New Zealand also won the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy as a result of this win.\nEngland vs Sri Lanka.\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and elected for his side to bat first. The England openers started solidly, but they were reduced from 62/0 in the 10th over to 101/3 in the 21st. Joe Root and Morgan added 60 runs for the fourth wicket before the dismissal of Morgan. The fifth wicket partnership between Root and James Taylor yielded 98 runs in 11 overs. Taylor fell for 25, following which Root was also dismissed for a 108-ball 121. England were 265/6 in the 47th over, before Jos Buttler struck an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls to take the total to 309/6 at the end of 50 overs.\nSri Lankan innings began with Lahiru Thirimanne being dropped on 3. His opening partner Tillakaratne Dilshan was out for 44 immediately after their partnership had reached 100 runs. Kumar Sangakkara joined Thirimanne and the left-hand duo punished the England bowlers with each of the batsmen making hundreds. Thirimanne struck a six off the third ball of the 48th over to complete an emphatic 9-wicket victory. Thirimanne remained unbeaten on a 143-ball 139, while Sangakkara won the Man of the Match for his unbeaten 117 off just 86 balls.\nAustralia vs Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi won the toss and put Australia in to bat. After losing the wicket of Aaron Finch in the third over, Australia put on a 260-run second wicket partnership between David Warner and Steve Smith, before Warner was dismissed for 178 off 133 balls. Smith and Glenn Maxwell then shared 65 runs in 32 balls for the third wicket before Smith fell five runs short of a hundred. Maxwell continued scoring at a brisk rate, but, in the 48th over, he was dismissed for a 39-ball 88. Brad Haddin scored an unbeaten 20 off 9 balls towards the end of the innings to push the Australian total to 417/6 at the end of their 50 overs, which was the highest-ever total in a World Cup match.\nAfghanistan's chase was dented at regular intervals by the Australian fast bowlers. Former Afghan captain Nawroz Mangal top-scored for his team with 33 and no other batsman could go past 25. Mitchell Johnson picked up four wickets for Australia as Afghanistan were bowled out for 142 in 37.3 overs. This gave Australia a 275-run victory, the third largest victory in terms of runs in a World Cup match.\nAustralia vs Sri Lanka.\nAustralian captain Michael Clarke won the toss and elected to bat. A shaky start in the opening, led to the fall of David Warner for 9. The shaky start from Australia continued when the other opener Finch fell for 24."

        "title": "The Tennis Court Oath (David)",
        "text": "The Tennis Court Oath (French: \"Le Serment du Jeu de paume\") is an incomplete painting by the French Neoclassical artist Jacques-Louis David, painted between 1790 and 1794 and showing the titular Tennis Court Oath at Versailles, one of the foundational events of the French Revolution. \nPolitical reversals and financial difficulties meant that David was never able to finish the canvas, which measures 400 by 660 cm and is now in the Musée national du Château de Versailles.\nDescription.\nAll the deputies are shown looking at Bailly, as a device to show their support for him. The only man to refuse to take the oath, Martin-Dauch, is shown in the lower right hand corner and provides a counterpoint to the general enthusiasm. David also drew all the faces in detail so that every figure was recognisable. Above are large windows with smiling figures of the public.\nSymbolic interpretation.\nIn the 18th century, an oath had a sacred value and guaranteed a person would be faithful to their word, as in David's own \"The Oath of the Horatii\". During the French Revolution, collective oaths like the tennis court oath were considered as a factor in national unity and national unanimity. The tennis court oath – pre-Romantic, near-unanimous, almost totally middle-class, and with no popular violence – above all was considered the forerunner of the 1789 revolution and also showed that national sovereignty was made up of each individual's personal will.\nDavid's painting also portrays the monk Dom Gerle alongside the Protestant pastor Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, symbolizing a new era of religious tolerance. The wind blowing through the windows and billowing the curtains also symbolizes the wind of Revolution blowing through France.\nThis painting shows the Third Estate gathered together at an indoor tennis court after King Louis XVI locked the meeting hall at Versailles once he rejected to change the voting system. This is when Estate General proclaimed themselves as the National Assembly of France.\nHistory.\nThe first engravings showing \"The Tennis Court Oath\" only appeared in 1790, the year David convinced the Jacobin Club to launch a national subscription to fund a painting to depict the event. He exhibited a pen and brown ink drawing of his planned painting in the Louvre in 1791 but did not have enough money to follow it through as the subscription had only had a 10% take-up. The National Constituent Assembly thus decided to fund the work from the public treasury instead, topped up by selling engravings of the painting.\nDavid set up a studio in the former Les Feuillants Convent to hold sittings for the deputies, then meeting in the nearby salle du Manège. However, by 1793, he was too busy as a deputy himself to complete his sketch for the painting and French political life was no longer conducive to the work – Mirabeau, one of the heroes of 1789, had been declared an enemy of the Revolution on the discovery of his secret correspondence with Louis XVI and was now considered as a traitor by public opinion. A large number of deputies to the National Constituent Assembly had been identified as enemies of the Government of Public Safety. David therefore left the work unfinished and the subscribers reclaimed their engraving from him.\nDavid's 1810 \"The Distribution of the Eagle Standards\" and his 1814 \"Leonidas at Thermopylae\" were directly inspired by \"The Tennis Court Oath\". The work was also reprised and adapted by several artists from the late 18th century onwards. These included Auguste Couder in 1848 and Luc-Olivier Merson in 1883.\nIn 1820, David ceded the engraving rights on Jean Pierre Marie Jazet's engraving of \"The Tennis Court Oath\" to Daniel Isoard de Martouret. The canvas itself was finally acquired in 1836 by the royal museums for the Louvre, where it was exhibited from 1880 onwards."

        "title": "List of Leicestershire County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Leicestershire. The club was established on 25 March 1879. It has since played first-class cricket from 1894, List A cricket from 1963 and Twenty20 cricket from 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" has diminished since the 1980s. Leicestershire's first XI have played home matches at fifteen different grounds.\nThe club's debut home match in first-class cricket was played at Grace Road in Leicester. After the 1900 season, the club ceased using Grace Road, as it was felt that it was located too far from the centre of the city. Instead, Aylestone Road became the club's headquarters, and staged nearly 400 first-class matches between 1901 and the outbreak of the Second World War. Due to a combination of wartime damage and industrial development, however, the club was forced to discontinue using Aylestone Road after the war, and Grace Road once again became the club's main venue. In the years after the war, the county also utilised grounds in other towns including Hinckley, Melton Mowbray, Barwell and Loughborough.\nIn addition to the county's inaugural first-class match, Grace Road also played host to Leicestershire's first home games in the other formats of cricket. In 1964 it staged the county's first home List A game against Northamptonshire and in 2003 it was the venue for the county's first home game in Twenty20 cricket against Yorkshire. The ground has hosted the vast majority of the county's games, including every Twenty20 match since the introduction of that format. Since 1991, when the club played its last game at Leicester Road in Hinckley, the only venue other than Grace Road to host any of Leicestershire's matches is the Oakham School Ground, which is actually located in the adjacent county of Rutland. The school was used for five first-class matches from 2000–07 and nine List A games from 2001–08, followed by a further List A game in 2018 after an absence of ten years.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Leicestershire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Leicestershire CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches, also known as limited overs or one-day matches, are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. The Leicestershire Cricket Board team played one List A match at each of Kirkby Road and Leicester Road in 2001. The Leicestershire Cricket Board is a separate organisation from Leicestershire County Cricket Club and its matches are not included in the totals."

        "text": "The Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team was founded in 1904 to represent the University of Arizona in intercollegiate competition and has participated in the sport all but one season since its inception. Over the course of the team's history, the Wildcats' performance has ranged from losing records to resulting in a national championship.\nDuring periods of both ascendancy and mediocrity, individual Arizona players of exceptional ability have received various accolades. In total, Wildcats have been named to an All-America team 31 times, and All-Pac-12 Conference team 110 times. Of the All-America selections, thirty-seven players received first-team honors a total of fifty-eight times. Sixteen players were named consensus first-team All-Americans a total of twenty-five times.\nWildcats have won several nationally recognized individual awards, including the Bob Cousy Award, the Senior CLASS Award, Academic All-America of the Year, and several of the National Player of the Year awards. The College Basketball Hall of Fame has inducted one former Arizona player, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has enshrined three. Former Wildcats head coach have also been inducted into the College Basketball Hall of Fame.\nAll-Americans.\nEach year, numerous publications and organizations release lists of All-America teams, hypothetical rosters of players considered the best in the nation at their respective positions. Some selecting organizations choose more than one roster of All-Americans, in which case they use the terms \"first team\", \"second team\", and \"third team\" as appropriate. Some selectors also award honorable mentions to outstanding players who did not make any of their teams. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a college sports governing body, uses officially recognized All-America selectors to determine the \"consensus\" selections. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. Over time, the sources used to determine the consensus selections have changed, and since 1997, the NCAA has used these selectors to determine consensus All-Americans: Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC).\nThe following is a list of Arizona Wildcats men's basketball players that were named first, second or third team All-Americans:\nConsensus All-Americans\nSource: Arizona 2029–21 Media Guide\nFourteen Arizona players have received AP All-America honorable mention:\nAll-Pac-12 Conference.\nThe following is a list of Arizona Wildcats men's basketball players that were named first, second or third team All-Pac-12:\nFirst team All-Pac-12\nSecond team All-Pac-12\nThird team All-Pac-12\nNote\nPac-12 All Freshman Team \nNote\nPac-12 All Newcomer\nNote\nPac-12 All-Defensive Team\nPac-12 All-Academic Team\nAll-Pac 12 Tournament Team\nNote\nSource: Arizona 2020–21 Media Guide \nAward Recipients.\nPlayers.\nJohn R.

It was founded on 20 October 2004 and became affiliated to the North America Caribbean Rugby Association (NACRA) in the following year.\nRugby was introduced to the Dominican Republic in 1972 by Jean-Paul Bossuge, a French diplomat. The game began to grow, particularly within the universities, and by the 1970s the original Dominican Rugby Union had been formed with Dr. William Acosta appointed as its inaugural president. Dominican teams began competing in domestic and international tournaments and by the 1980s there were ten active clubs. However, rugby was not officially recognised by the Dominican Olympic Committee and funding for the game was low. Interest waned by the early 1990s. \nDominican Rugby was revived in 1997 with teams being sent to Trinidad and Tobago's rugby sevens tournament from 1997 to 2000. Recognising a need to retain and increase player numbers, Fedorugby was formed in 2004 to bring the Dominican rugby clubs and players together under one organising body. \nNational teams.\nThe Dominican national sevens team has played in regional competitions such as Trinidad and Tobago's Rugby Sevens tournament.

        "title": "Super Bowl LI halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LI Halftime show took place on February 5, 2017, at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, as part of Super Bowl LI. Lady Gaga headlined the show, with no special guests (the first overall solo-headlined show since the 2010 edition and the first female solo-headlined show without special guests since the 1996 edition), performing a medley of her songs, including material from her then-most recent studio album, \"Joanne\" (2016). It is currently the most nominated Super Bowl halftime show in Emmy Awards history, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special.\nGaga began rehearsing for the show in January 2017. Her sister gave her the idea of performing from atop the NRG Stadium; Gaga worked on the logistics behind it. She promoted the performance by uploading short clips on her social media accounts. Fashion house Versace created the wardrobe for the show with a custom jumpsuit for the singer, while designers Bruce Rodgers and LeRoy Bennett did the show's production work with lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees. The stage was created by All Access Staging &amp; Productions, which had also created previous Super Bowl halftime stages. During the introduction scene, Gaga was accompanied by a fleet of 300 drones provided by Intel, which formed an image of the American flag behind the singer. It marked the first time the drones had been used as part of a television broadcast.\nThe show was noted for its acknowledgment of the LGBT community, the perceived political undertones, and the technical achievement of the use of drones. It received critical acclaim, with media outlets praising Gaga for demonstrating artistic and musical qualities while citing it as one of the top Super Bowl halftime performances ever. With 117.5 million television viewers, it was the fourth most-watched Super Bowl halftime show after the halftime shows during Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl LVII and Super Bowl LVIII, and had higher average viewership than the game itself. Gaga's music catalog benefited from the performance, with sales growth for all her records. The song \"Million Reasons\" from \"Joanne\", which was part of the set list, consequently became her 14th top-ten single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart.\nSynopsis.\nThe halftime show began on the roof of NRG Stadium. Lady Gaga started singing \"God Bless America\" (1939) as drones swarm behind her emitting red, white and blue color. She then sang Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" (1945), followed by the ending of the Pledge of Allegiance: \"One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" Gaga then dove from the rooftop as the drones behind her formed the design of the US flag. She came down from the roof and stood on a tall pillar across the stage as a montage of her songs \"Dance In the Dark\" (2009), \"Just Dance\" (2008), \"LoveGame\" (2008), and \"Paparazzi\" (2008) played in the background. She then sang a line from \"The Edge of Glory\" (2011) before abruptly switching to \"Poker Face\" (2008), as fireworks lit up behind her. After the first verse and chorus, Gaga, attached to a harness, bounced from the pillar to the main stage. Her dancers joined her as she sang \"Born This Way\" (2011), which included the track's intermediate spoken verse.\nAs the song ended, Gaga headed towards a star-shaped structure on another corner of the stage before singing \"Telephone\" (2009), while holding her characteristic \"Disco Stick\" prop. A dancer carried her back to center stage where she performed \"Just Dance\" (2008) with a keytar. The singer moved from the stage to the ground as the song ended before moving to a podium with a piano. She began singing \"Million Reasons\" (2016) as the audience on the field synchronously waved LED batons. Continuing the song, she came down from the podium and embraced a fan in the audience. For the finale of \"Bad Romance\" (2009), a team of white-clad dancers strutted across the main stage as Gaga disappeared into the crowd for a quick-change. She finally ran back onto the stage wearing a white football-inspired costume as they performed the track's choreography accompanied by flamethrowers. After performing the song's bridge and last chorus on a raised platform, Gaga was carried to the edge of the stage by her dancers. As the song concluded, fireworks erupted before Gaga jumped off the stage while catching a football.\nBackground.\nAround August 2016, media outlets began reporting that Adele was in discussions with the National Football League (NFL) to perform at the Super Bowl LI halftime show, which was planned for February 5, 2017, at Houston's NRG Stadium. Pepsi Zero Sugar would sponsor the show. During her Adele Live 2016 concert tour in Los Angeles, Adele clarified that although she had been asked to perform by the NFL, she had declined since she did not believe she was suitable for the halftime show. Soon after, the NFL explained they had not signed any musician and were still in discussions with several artists.\nIn the meantime, Gaga announced that she would be releasing her fifth studio album, \"Joanne\", in October 2016. \"Billboard\" reported that the NFL was in discussions with the singer, because of her performance of the national anthem at the previous Super Bowl. On September 29, 2016, Gaga confirmed on her Instagram account that she would be performing at the halftime show. Fox Sports president and executive producer of the show, John Entz, also confirmed Gaga's involvement, and added, \"[She] is one of the most electric performers of our generation, and we couldn't be happier with the choice to have her headline the Super Bowl LI Halftime Show... It is going to be an incredible night.\"\nAccording to Emma Quigley, Pepsi's North American head of music, and Justin Toman, Pepsi's sports marketing director, choosing Gaga to headline the show made sense based on her previous musical output and endeavors. They considered various parameters—social media followers, record sales, trending topic—and then shortlisted her. Toman also took into account the total time it usually takes for the show—seven minutes for set up, 12 minutes for the main show, and another seven minutes to dismantle—and believed the singer could deliver \"power, punch, performance, singing, lights\" within that time frame.\nDevelopment.\nConception.\nIn October 2016, Gaga told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that she wanted to give \"the best show for the football fans, the ones that are watching at home\". Although indecisive about the set list, the singer wanted to play a mixture of her past and recent songs. She also confirmed that the NFL heard \"Joanne\" before its release and decided to offer her the halftime performance slot. Her inspiration came from earlier halftime performances by Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and Bruce Springsteen. Gaga remarked that she loved \"all the [past shows]\". In December 2016, Gaga launched the \"Guest of Honor\" contest with Pepsi and the NFL. This would give her fans the opportunity to see the halftime show from the stage's sidelines. The singer uploaded a video titled \"Fanifesto\", talking about the power of fandom. She explained that to win, fans had to upload a 15–60-second video on Instagram or Twitter with the hashtags #GOHContest and #PepsiHalftime by December 15, professing their fandom for Gaga.\n\"Billboard\" Colin Stutz revealed that Gaga would not be accompanied by any guest musicians, which was different from the shows of the past few years. She was the first headliner to perform with no special guests since The Who during their 2010 show and only the eighth act to do so. Pepsi confirmed in a press release that a ten-second countdown would precede Gaga's performance, when a lead-in, produced by Creator's Studio featuring jazz singer Tony Bennett, would be shown. Gaga confirmed her plan to sing from atop the dome of NRG Stadium, an idea given to her by her sister Natali Germanotta. US media had expected Gaga to do \"something overtly political\" during her performance. The NFL refuted news that they had forbidden the singer from mentioning President Donald Trump during the show. A representative from the organization issued a statement saying, \"The Super Bowl is a time when people really come together. Lady Gaga is focused on putting together an amazing show for fans and we love working with her on it; we aren't going to be distracted by this.\"\nRehearsals.\nBy January 2017, Gaga began posting images on her social media accounts, showing her practicing for the show. She first built a tent in her backyard where she rehearsed with her dancers for weeks. Gaga enlisted vocal coach Don Lawrence to help her belt out the correct notes. Lawrence worked with Gaga for her National Anthem performance the previous year, as well as during her concert tours.\nPepsi uploaded a behind-the-scenes video from the rehearsals, where Gaga explained the main challenge was to make the halftime performance different from the preceding years but to still keep it about the music. On his social media, choreographer Richy Jackson was shown in the middle of a session with the dancers, displaying the characteristic moves from the song, \"Bad Romance\". Jackson said the dancers were hand-picked and had worked before with the singer. He added the show would unveil a different aspect of Gaga, since she had never had the opportunity to perform on a big world stage like the Super Bowl.\nAs the day of the show approached, the singer kept posting short videos from rehearsals as well as behind-the-scenes. She showed her pre-game dance routines and choreography, FaceTimeing with her grandmother, warming up for the show, and the onstage activities. Toman explained that they wanted to have fans get \"a peek into the journey to halftime, tapping into the artist fanbase—that really works. Doing a behind-the-scenes content program, giving people that glimpse of what it takes to prepare. People love that. So that really worked and we continue to do that.\" In an interview with \"Billboard\", Gaga explained: \"I really had a real sense of being in the zone for this performance, worked on it for a really long time, took months, trained hard. Every second I wanted to give the world and my fans what they deserve, a great show. Its really exciting, I wanted to enjoy the moment not just be hell bent [sic] on everything.\"\nFashion.\nAfter the release of \"Joanne\", Gaga began wearing simple outfits, deviating from her previously outrageous attire. Before the halftime show, there was much uncertainty about what she would wear for the performance. Versace created all the looks for the show, including the final one inspired by the label's Spring 2017 collection. The singer wore a custom, Atelier Versace, iridescent-colored jumpsuit, beaded all over with Swarovski crystals, along with high shoulder pads and matching knee-length boots. The bodysuit facilitated swift movement onstage, aiding to Gaga's mobility.\nAccording to fashion expert Cameron Silver, Gaga's look for the performance of \"Bad Romance\" was the \"most interesting\". It consisted of sequined silver hot pants and a football shoulder-pad-like jacket. \"Billboard\" deemed both the outfits a \"customary nod\" to Gaga's past, adding, \"It was a solid balance of glam and sexy without overdoing it [...] [The dress] gave fantasy to her fans. She looked great. She sounded great. It's like she was playing football in heels.\" Gaga also wore a golden jacket which had shoulder spikes while playing the keytar.\nGaga's longtime collaborator Brandon Maxwell styled her looks; singer David Bowie's persona Ziggy Stardust influenced her makeup. Donatella Versace flew to Houston to help with the costumes, including dressing the singer before the show. Sarah Nicole Tanno did Gaga's makeup, and Frederic Aspiras coiffed her hair. Tanno used products from Marc Jacobs' cosmetics line to give Gaga a \"timeless\" look. The singer wore a pair of eye masks made of crystals, extending to her temples. According to Vanessa Friedman of \"The New York Times\" choosing Versace as her fashion brand for the costumes \"helped to support a subtler, arguably more powerful, message\" by Gaga. She had promised to make the show about \"inclusion\" and to that extent, using Versace and a number of other designers like Dr. Martens and Vera Wang made the point.\nMultimedia.\nDesigners Bruce Rodgers of Tribe Inc., LeRoy Bennett, and lighting designer Bob Barnhart of 22 Degrees handled the show's production work. All Access Staging &amp; Productions, the creators of previous Super Bowl halftime stages, built the stage. Its key features included a main platform, two towers, three star-shaped side stages, a piano dome and a stage lift. The towers were about tall and could be carried by carts to the field for set-up. All Access had just over four weeks to create the pieces and the main stage. It required 17 trucks for storage and transport. The show used an LED system from Verrents and sound by ATK Audiotek. About 5,000 LED lights were embedded in the stage. Special effects group Strictly FX handled the pyrotechnics.\nBoth Rodgers and Bennett combined their ideas for the show, with input from Barnhart and special effects designer Mark Grega from FX. Rodgers described the stage setup as \"the most intense technological and visually impactful epic possible\". The show featured a field cast led by KP Terry; they used Glow Motion LED batons, creating a 3D moving pixel show. Glow Motion, a Nashville-based company, programmed each individual baton to sync with the music played. \"All our field cast and staging experts, technicians and vendors [had] stepped up to support the vision, and Gaga herself, having embraced the concept early on, [had] taken on the task with more interest and heart than any other artist that I've worked with in the last 11 years,\" Rodgers concluded.\nProduction Resource Group (PRG) supplied the show's lighting. PRG's Chris Conti shared Barnhart's floor plan for the lighting setup, which used DMX512 to control the system. Barnhart recalled that \"[the] show was a little more complicated this year, due to the amount of scenery that we normally don't have on a halftime show\", but it was better since there were no video backdrops. An array of 36 Clay Paky Sharpy fixtures was added around the roof of NRG Stadium, which lit the Houston night sky with light beams. Barnhart also arranged a backlight array fixture, using Philips Vari-Lite VL4000 and PRG Best Boy. LED tape, controlled by the lighting team, was used around the main production area. They could light the stage from afar. Director Hamish Hamilton and his crew devised their own way of capturing and transmitting the show for the live audience.\nDrones.\nWhile performing on top of NRG Stadium, a fleet of 300 synchronized, LED-equipped \"Shooting Star\" quadcopter drones provided by Intel accompanied Gaga. They formed an image of the American flag behind the singer. This marked the first time the drones were used as part of a television broadcast. According to Intel's senior vice president Josh Walden, \"Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before ... The potential for these light show drones is endless.\" Barnhart explained he had wanted to use drones in the Super Bowl for many years, but never encountered the appropriate technology. With permission from producer Ricky Kirshner, he reached out to Intel representatives and communicated that he wanted to use their drone technology for a \"large TV show in February. I can't give you money, but I can give you exposure\"; Intel agreed.\nSince the drones did not fly indoors, Barnhart wrote a new creative segment for the opening, with Gaga singing atop the roof of the stadium and the drones flying behind her. The segment was filmed earlier in the week due to safety concerns over flying the formation over a live audience. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) forbid the use of drones within a radius of NRG Stadium (which is also located near William P. Hobby Airport). The production staff obtained special permission from the FAA to perform the drone acrobatics.\nIntel began preparing in early December 2016, working out the logistics. After coming to a consensus with the creative team, they began storyboarding the drones, finally deciding to display a star array, the American flag and the Pepsi logo. The drones used for the show had a plastic and foam body for soft impacts, which were about square and weighed . They were connected wirelessly to a central computer and each executed their unique, individual choreography.\nCritical response.\nA writer for \"Time\" described the show as \"among the very best in the history of the form, racing ambitiously through the artist's entire career and putting forward the qualities of the artist that just \"work\"\". \"The New Yorker\" review described Gaga and the show as \"an astute, intense, and disciplined performance\". Andrew Unterberger of \"Billboard\" felt the performance would go down as \"one of the best halftime sets of the century\" and that it had cemented her as a \"legacy artist... It was Gaga through and through, and every song felt more gratifying than the last... reminding you why Gaga's pop supremacy was so inarguable not all that long ago.\" He noted that there was nothing \"outrageous\" in the show.\nChris Chase of Fox Sports said the halftime show would \"go down with Michael, Prince, Beyoncé, and Bruce as the greatest ever.\" Marguerite Ward from CNBC considered the show to be Gaga's comeback, noting how she had announced in 2015 that she would retire. \"Fast forward to 2017. [Lady Gaga] is back on the global stage, gearing up for a new world tour\", she added. Writing for \"Variety\", Sonia Saraiya described the show as \"breathtaking\" and \"soar[ing]\", but felt it \"lacked an iconic moment or emotional button\". Daniel Fienberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" was disappointed the show never had a \"close-up or any sort of swooping medium-shot to accentuate [Gaga's] movement\". He felt that the show lacked any political messages and that \"the weakly presented dive\" detracted from her rendition of \"God Bless America\" and \"This Land Is Your Land\".\nNico Land of \"Salon\" noted Gaga was the first artist to refer to the LGBT community during a Super Bowl halftime show when she sang \"Born This Way\". Land considered this a \"crucial milestone\" for the community. He said, \"Putting LGBT issues on the main stage at the Super Bowl served as a powerful message of queer solidarity in the face on an unprecedented wave of challenges from our government.\" Although Gaga did not openly criticize Trump, Land viewed the singer's opening performance as a subtle \"dig\" at the President. Singing \"This Land Is Your Land\", a protest anthem for the Women's Marches across the country following Trump's inauguration, Gaga referred to Trump's policies on immigration, according to the writer. According to Joanna Robinson of \"Vanity Fair\", the performance was a \"dog whistle\" against Trump's plans to build a wall between the United States and Mexico.\nAt the 69th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, which took place in September 2017, the performance received six nominations—the most by any halftime show. It won for Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special, while nominated for Outstanding Special Class Program, Outstanding Production Design for Variety, Nonfiction, Event or Award Special, Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Limited Series, Movie, or Special, Outstanding Music Direction, and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Variety Series or Special.\nCommercial reception.\nIn the United States, the Super Bowl LI halftime show experienced the first increase in viewership since 2015 (and the last such ratings rebound in the 2010s decade). The performance attracted 117.5 million television viewers, making it the fourth most watched halftime show, behind the Super Bowl halftime shows in 2015, 2023 and 2024, respectively. For the fourth year in a row, the viewership was higher than the game, which was viewed by an audience of 111.3 million. Gaga's halftime show currently holds the record for the largest average game-to-halftime show audience percentage gain - at 5.6% more viewers - since the NFL switched back to regular booking of mainstream pop acts for Super Bowl halftime shows in 2011. A total of 5.1 million tweets were made about Gaga's performance, including 2.2 million during her show, making her the most tweeted-about entertainer in the show's history. According to statistics presented by \"Billboard\", the most tweeted moments were when the show ended, followed by Gaga waving at her parents from the stage, and when the singer descended from the NRG Stadium roof in a harness. The set list was also included in the most tweets tabulation with \"Bad Romance\" getting the highest number of tweets. \"Telephone\" was the second most tweeted-about song followed by \"Born This Way\".\nAccording to Nielsen SoundScan on the day of the show, Gaga sold 150,000 digital albums and songs in the United States, up by 1,000% from the previous day. The singer sold a total of 125,000 digital song downloads, led by \"Million Reasons\" (45,000 up by 900%), then \"Bad Romance\" (13,000), \"Born This Way\" (12,000) and \"Poker Face\" (10,000). Her albums sold more than 23,000 downloads, with \"Joanne\" selling over 12,000 copies, followed by \"The Fame Monster\" (2009), which sold about 6,000. Gaga acquired over 24,000 listeners on music streaming website Pandora Radio. Total station adds for the singer went up by 1,391% week-by-week with a cumulative 14.8 million stations; her songs received 2.5 billion spins. All the songs performed received significant spin boosts. This was different from the previous halftime shows, when Coldplay was up by 225%, Bruno Mars by 62%, and Beyoncé up 60%.\nAfter the final tabulation, Gaga sold over 410,000 digital song downloads for the tracking week of February 9, 2017, an increase of 1,850%. \"Million Reasons\" (which had dropped off the chart the previous week), re-entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number four, becoming Gaga's 14th top-ten single. It also reached the top of the Digital Songs chart with 149,000 downloads. Other songs entering the Digital Songs chart were \"Born This Way\" (41,000, number seven), \"Bad Romance\" (39,000, number nine) \"Poker Face\" (34,000, number fourteen), \"Just Dance\" (25,000, number 26) and \"Telephone\" (20,000, number 39). Gaga's streaming activity increased by 196% to 41.8 million streams, led by \"Million Reasons\" with 3.9 million plays. Her album sales increased by 844% to 135,000 equivalent units, with \"Joanne\" rising from 66 to 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 74,000 units (48,000 traditional album sales). Other entries on the chart included \"The Fame\" (2008) (38,000, number 6), \"Born This Way\" (2011) (17,000, number 25) and \"Artpop\" (2013) (5,000, number 174). Gaga reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Artist 100 chart, which measures activity across various social media websites as well as record sales.\nThe Super Bowl performance also had an impact in Canada, where \"Joanne\" vaulted from 54 to 2, with a 524% gain in album-equivalent units. In the United Kingdom, \"Joanne\"s sales were up by 222%, while \"The Fame\" was up by 1,605% after the show. On the UK Albums Chart, \"Joanne\" moved from 88 to 11, with sales increasing to 5,289 copies, while the latter entered at number 38, selling 2,263 copies.\nSet list.\nThe following songs were performed during the halftime show.\nPersonnel.\nCredits and personnel adapted from \"Live Design\" website.\nMain performer\nCreative personnel\nVendors\nLighting crew\nArt design team\nStage video and projection crew\nIntel Shooting Star drone team\nAll Access staging and productions crew"

        "title": "Super Bowl LII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl LII Halftime Show (officially known as the Pepsi Super Bowl LII Halftime Show) took place on February 4, 2018, at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as part of Super Bowl LII. Justin Timberlake was the featured performer, as confirmed by the National Football League (NFL) on October 22, 2017. It was televised nationally by NBC with a total of 106.6 million television viewers, down 9% from the previous years' Super Bowl LI halftime show.\nBackground.\nIn July 2017, Britney Spears was rumored to be the headliner, but Pepsi quickly denied it. During August and September 2017, several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to perform at the Super Bowl LII halftime, first along with his frequent-collaborator Jay-Z as co-headliner, and then as the solo performer. Jay-Z was also rumored to be a solo performer, but it was reported that he turned it down due to the NFL's treatment of Colin Kaepernick, which he later confirmed in his song \"Apeshit.\" A spokesperson from the NFL stated at the time, \"along with Pepsi, we know that we will put on a spectacular show. When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his name. Or their names.\" The NFL confirmed the announcement that Timberlake would be headlining on October 22 with a video starring Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon.\nThis was Timberlake's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show. As a member of NSYNC, Timberlake appeared in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show (2001), and as a guest artist in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show (2004), which performance featured a controversial incident where Timberlake accidentally exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts on national television, described as a wardrobe malfunction. The Parents Television Council penned an open letter to Timberlake asking to keep the performance \"family-friendly.\" While the organization acknowledged that Timberlake apologized for the 2004 incident, they asked him to stay true to his word, saying \"we are heartened by your response that the events of 2004 are not going to happen in 2018,\" as the singer stated in a prior interview that \"we are not going to do that again.\"\nIn an interview with \"Billboard\", Pepsi executives expressed:\nThe Halftime Show included a remembrance for Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson, who died just hours before Super Bowl LII after being struck by a vehicle.\nDevelopment.\nDuring the performance, Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney, which consists of \"alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt, featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley,\" according to a press release. Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales-check and camouflage splatter-print suit and matching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-free leather and organic cotton.\nMarty Kudelka, a longtime collaborator of Timberlake, choreographed the set. The show featured past tour dancers, Ivan Koumaev, Dana Wilson, Natalie Gilmore, Maja Karesh, Max Pham Nguyen, Codie Wiggins, Diana Matos, Lyle Beniga, Lindsay Richardson, among others.\nTimberlake stated in a press conference that there would be no guest musicians in the halftime show and that the event would focus solely on himself and his backing band, the Tennessee Kids. Regarding the Prince tribute, the performance's creative visual lead, Fireplay's Nick Whitehouse, told \"Rolling Stone\":\nPrince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after death in a 1998 interview, citing The Beatles' \"Free as a Bird\" as an example of a practice he considered to be \"demonic.\" His family granted permission to use Prince's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a hologram, and they approved of the final result. Sheila E, a former bandmate of Prince's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness, stated that \"a bigger company\" (she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the NFL) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was not originally Timberlake's idea.\nDespite the lack of an individual guest artist, the more than 300-member University of Minnesota Marching Band was featured in the show. The band's drumline, brass, and saxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his performance of \"Suit &amp; Tie.\" The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led drill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake's performance of his song \"Mirrors\", and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the show, including the club scene at the show's opening. All members of the band were featured on the field in the show's finale, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\". The band had previously performed in the halftime show of Super Bowl XXVI.\nSynopsis.\nThe show began with Jimmy Fallon introducing Justin Timberlake, followed by a video screen depicting Timberlake performing \"Filthy\" in a club setting below the field level of the stadium. He then walked up a staircase and appeared on a ramp stage extending outward into the field, descending into a series of stages surrounded by a crowd. Timberlake proceeded to move through the crowd performing \"Rock Your Body\" with a troupe of female backup dancers, abruptly stopping short of the end of the song and shifting to \"Señorita\" on a small stage with his backing dancers. Upon reaching the main stage, he performed a number of songs, including \"SexyBack\", \"My Love\", and \"Cry Me a River\", which featured a dance break mid-field. Upon reaching the next stage, Timberlake performed his hit song \"Suit &amp; Tie\" as the University of Minnesota Marching Band, wearing black tuxedos, played backup instrumentals and marched out to meet him.\nTimberlake proceeded to walk up to a white grand piano while performing \"Until the End of Time\", then segued into \"I Would Die 4 U\" as a tribute to Minneapolis-native Prince. A video of Prince performing the song played in the background, projected onto on a large multi-story sheet. An aerial shot showed downtown Minneapolis covered in purple lighting that morphed into Prince's trademark Love Symbol, with the stadium at the center. He then returned to the main stage to perform \"Mirrors\", as hundreds of dancers and members of the marching band performed choreography with large mirrors, creating bright reflections in the broadcast and across the roof of the stadium. Timberlake closed the show with \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\", entering the stands at the conclusion of the song.\nFor the first time since the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in Indianapolis in 2012, no pyrotechnics were used throughout the performance. The show relied mostly on lasers and video screens for visual effects.\nCritical response.\nTimberlake's performance received mixed reviews. In a positive review, Bruce R. Miller of \"Sioux City Journal\" wrote \"Timberlake is a masterful live performer – which made Sunday's Super Bowl performance about the only sure bet,\" he continued commenting that the performer \"did a lot of infectious dancing and managed to play with the crowd like no other.\" Although it did not have a moment that \"stuck,\" he considered the Prince tribute the best moment of the show. In a similarly positive review, Taylor Weatherby of \"Billboard\" said \"there is no denying that Timberlake absolutely rocked his first headlining [halftime]\", further adding \"Timberlake's halftime show was undeniably mesmerizing. From starting in the concourse to making his way into the crowd (and making #SelfieKid an instant superstar) for the ending.\" She also considered it to be a \"made for a TV experience\" rather than for the public in the stadium, mainly for the sound quality difficulties, but also criticized him for including Rock Your Body in the set list. From the same magazine, Nina Braca wrote \"his moves were on point,\" and Andrew Ubterberger said two things were \"relatively certain\" about the performance. \"most of America would love it, and most of the Internet would hate it,\" and added Timberlake was \"in a situation that was both a can't-lose and a can't-win. It would've been virtually impossible for him to please the critics he'd alienated over the last couple years.\" Also from Billboard, Andrew Unterberge wrote, \"Timberlake's audio was somewhat lacking throughout...but the choreography, live-band energy and song selection were all pretty impeccable\".\nChris Willman of \"Variety\" stated that, \"Timberlake turned in a more enjoyably physical performance than just about anybody else who's done the Bowl show… and if it was more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism, you can't say that's entirely inappropriate for the occasion.\" Willman also wrote that the show, \"wasn't one for the ages, but was impressive as a show of athleticism\"\nJon Caramanica of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Timberlake's performance was, \"heavy on dance spectacle, light on vocal authority\". Daniel Fienberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the show, \"energetic, but also entirely lacking in live excitement.\" Feinberg criticized the show for largely lacking spontaneity and live vocals. Feinberg wrote that Timberlake delivered, \"one of the most over-planned, least surprising performances imaginable.\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly graded Timberlake's performance a \"C\", calling it, \"dutiful, and empty\". Franich faulted Timberlake for playing too safe with his performance. Similarly, Fran Guan of Vulture.com wrote, \"Technically speaking, Timberlake's set was a testament to precision\". Guan, however, criticized Timberlake's performance from lacking in personality, and regarded his performance as unmemorable.\n\"The Guardian\" gave Timberlake 3 out of 5 stars, calling his performance forgettable but flashy.\nIn an interview with NPR, Ann Powers said that \"the entire performance was shrouded in the sense of Timberlake not being right for this moment — and the Janet Jackson controversy haunted it.\" Daniel D'Addarrio of Time.com gave the performance a negative review, criticizing Timberlake for singing \"Cry Me A River\" and \"Rock Your Body\", calling the first song's lyrics about an evil promiscuous woman out of step with the national mood, and said that the only message from Timberlake's performance was that he loves his back catalog \"Deadline\" felt \"but you could see the motions more than you felt the music.\" Chris Richards of \"The Washington Post\" regarded Timberlake's performance as, \"unambiguously underwhelming\".\n\"USA Today\" and \"Vulture\" compared Timberlake's performance unfavorably against Prince's own 2007 halftime show. Amanda Petrusich of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Timberlake's decision to omit the end of \"Rock Your Body\" (which was performed during the controversial 2004 halftime) felt, \"less like an apology than yet more spineless deflection\". However, Andrew Unterberge of Billboard considered Timberlake's decision to cut the song short to be wise. Timberlake's Stella McCartney-designed outfit received negative reviews, with some critics regarding it as \"tacky\". The LA Times also gave a very critical review, one which also stated that Timberlake had nothing to say in his performance, and said that it lacked soul and meaning.\nAt the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Super Bowl halftime show received four nominations: Outstanding Directing for a Variety Special, Outstanding Lighting Design/Lighting Direction for a Variety Special, Outstanding Music Direction, Outstanding Technical Direction, Camerawork, Video Control for a Limited Series, Movie Or Special.\nCommercial reception.\nThe Super Bowl LII halftime show was seen by 106.6 million television viewers in the United States, 9% less than Lady Gaga's in 2017. It had higher average viewership than the game itself, and the decline for the halftime show was roughly in line with that of the game as a whole, which had lost 7% compared to the previous year.\nAccording to initial sales reports from Nielsen Music, sales of the songs Timberlake performed during the halftime show gained 534% in the United States on February 4, the day of the Super Bowl, compared to Feb 3, while his streams on Spotify gained 214%."

        "title": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Warwickshire. The club was established on 8 April 1882 and has played first-class cricket since 1894, List A cricket since 1963, and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" has diminished since the 1980s. Warwickshire have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at eleven different grounds. Six of these grounds are or were located in the cities of Birmingham and Coventry, which no longer lie within the county of Warwickshire due to changes in the county boundaries in England in 1974.\nThe county's debut home match in first-class cricket was played at Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham against Kent in 1894. At this time the ground stood on land owned by the Gough-Calthorpe family, who had developed the manor of Edgbaston into an exclusive Birmingham suburb during the 19th century, and believed that a cricket ground would enhance the image of the district. Warwickshire had previously considered locating their headquarters in Rugby or Leamington Spa, but secretary William Ansell considered Birmingham more suitable due to its large population and railway connections. Edgbaston has remained the club's primary ground, hosting the majority of the club's matches, and also played host to the club's first home fixtures in the other formats of the game; in List A cricket in 1964 against Hampshire; and in Twenty20 cricket against Glamorgan in 2003. Since 1902 the ground has also hosted matches played by the England cricket team.\nWarwickshire played all their matches at Edgbaston until 1903, when they played at the Bulls Head Ground in Coventry, which was used once a year until 1919, other than during the First World War. Over 70 years later, the club returned to the ground for three matches in the early 1990s. Prior to the First World War the club also played first-class matches at Arlington Avenue in Leamington Spa and Weddington Road in Nuneaton. In the interwar years, the county began to play matches at The Butts Ground and Morris Motors Ground in Coventry, the Griff and Coton Ground in Nuneaton and the Mitchells and Butlers' Ground in Birmingham. Of these grounds, only the latter two continued to be used after the Second World War. In 1946 the county began to use the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry and continued to play there until the 1980s.\nThe only ground other than Edgbaston used by Warwickshire for first-class cricket in the 21st century is Swans Nest Lane in Stratford-upon-Avon. Having only previously played a single match there in 1951, Warwickshire returned to the ground to play one first-class match in each of 2004 and 2005 as well as a single List A match in the latter year. Additionally, the county played a Twenty20 match at Rugby School in 2013 and planned to make this an annual occurrence, although the match scheduled for 2014 was abandoned without any play taking place due to bad weather. The team did, however, play one List A match at the school in 2015, and have scheduled three matches at the school in the 2024 One-Day Cup. Some of the grounds formerly used by the county still play host to matches at lower levels of the sport, such as those in Leamington Spa and Stratford-upon-Avon, which are used regularly by club teams playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League. Others, however, are disused, such as the Courtaulds Ground in Coventry, which in 2011 was reported to be overgrown and derelict, with only one wall of the pavilion still standing.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Warwickshire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Warwickshire CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. The Warwickshire Cricket Board team played one List A match at Swans Nest Lane in 2000 and three List A matches at the Bulls Head Ground between 2001 and 2002. The Warwickshire Cricket Board is a separate organisation from Warwickshire County Cricket Club and its matches are not included in the totals."

Nichols, who the leading scorer and rebounder for the Tigers in 2014-15, was expected to lead the team in 2015-16 and was considered a likely first team all AAC player. Memphis initially denied Nichols' transfer request before later providing a release with restrictions. Nichols' attorney made a public statement after the restrictions were made public calling the restrictions a \"calculated effort by a dysfunctional staff to punish a player for taking a step to remove himself from a failing program.\" Nichols' announcement followed the departure of 5 other scholarship players to transfer since August 2014, including Dominic Woodson, Dominic Magee, Kuran Iverson, Nick King, and Pookie Powell. It also left Markel Crawford as the only remaining scholarship player from the Tigers' heralded 2013 recruiting class. The restrictions on Nichols' release were swiftly removed by Memphis Athletic Director Tom Bowen, and Nichols ultimately transferred to the University of Virginia (a team originally on the restricted list).\nOn December 2, 2015, Coach Pastner informed media that freshman guard Raquan Mitchell, who had not logged a minute of floor time with the Tigers, would be transferring at the end of the semester.\nIn January, guard Sam Craft joined the basketball team. Craft, a running back and wide receiver for the Memphis football team, had been forbidden from playing basketball by former Memphis football coach Justin Fuente. However, new football coach Mike Norvell lifted the restriction and permitted Craft to play basketball.\nAfter a home loss to AAC last place team East Carolina in January, Memphis newspaper columnist Geoff Calkins declared the Josh Pastner era \"over\" in Memphis. The Tigers suffered a 20-point home loss to UConn on February 4, 2016, which marked the worst home loss for the Tigers since February 1999.\nDuring the season, attendance at the FedEx Forum for Tigers' games dropped significantly from prior years. \"The Commercial Appeal\" discovered via a FOIA request that the actual turnstile attendance at Tiger games had fallen below 6,000 by mid February. The Tigers had previously not announced turnstile attendance figures but rather used tickets sold as official attendance numbers. The turnstile attendance became an issue of interest in the City of Memphis for the Tigers' last three home games of the year because the Tigers' facility usage agreement with the Memphis Grizzlies specified that the Tigers receive an annual payment from the NBA franchise if their turnstile attendance averaged over 6,000 for the year. The Tigers ultimately did achieve an average turnstile attendance figure above 6,000 for the year.\nUpon losing to Temple on March 3, the Tigers clinched a losing record in conference for the first time in 16 years. The Tigers were a six seed in the AAC tournament, but they defeated each of their first two tournament opponents (3 seed Tulsa and 10 seed Tulane) by at least 20 points. The Tigers faced 5 seed UConn in the AAC Tournament championship but were soundly defeated.\nHead coach Josh Pastner left Memphis to take the head coaching job at Georgia Tech on April 8, 2016.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"| American Athletic Conference tournament\nRankings.\nThe Tigers were not ranked and did not receive any top 25 votes in either major poll during the 2015-16 season."

        "text": "Joshua O'Neal Jackson (born February 10, 1997) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Stockton Kings of the NBA G League. He played college basketball for one season with the Kansas Jayhawks before declaring for the 2017 NBA draft, where he was selected fourth overall by the Phoenix Suns.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in San Diego County, California while his mother, Apples Jones, was serving in the U.S. Navy and lived there until he was eight months old when she moved them to Michigan to be closer to her family. In the eighth grade, he was held back a grade due to his passion for basketball overtaking his grades, with Jackson going to Voyager Middle School for his repeated year before entering high school. He attended Consortium College Prep School in Detroit, Michigan his freshman and sophomore years, before moving to Napa, California to attend Justin-Siena High School for his junior and senior year.\nHigh school career.\nAs a freshman for the Consortium College Prep School, Jackson averaged 17 points, six rebounds, four assists and four blocks per game. As a sophomore, he led the school to their first state title. He averaged 28 points, 15 rebounds, and six assists per game.\nPrior to his junior year, Jackson and his family moved to California to attend Justin-Siena High School in Napa, California and play for Prolific Prep. As a Junior, he averaged 31.2 points per game and 5.4 assists. As a Senior, Jackson averaged 26.9 Points and 13.1 rebounds per game. Jackson played AAU basketball for 1Nation Elite, a program founded by his mother. In March 2016, Jackson, played in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Game and led in scoring with 19 points, whilst also recording four rebounds and three assists. He was named Co-MVP alongside Frank Jackson.\nJackson was a five-star recruit and was regarded as one of the top players in the 2016 high school class. He was ranked number one in the 2016 class by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, while ESPN ranked him at number two behind only Harry Giles. 247Sports.com ranked him both as the top rated player in the 2016 class along with giving him a 102 rating, the highest rating ever given to a recruit by the website.\nCollege career.\nOn April 11, 2016, Jackson tweeted that he would be attending the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas to play basketball, picking KU over Michigan State and Arizona. During his only season at Kansas, Jackson showcased his all-around play between scoring, rebounding, play-making, and defending. Although he started as a power forward for the Jayhawks, not Jackson's normal positions of both small forward or shooting guard, he still recorded 16.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game with the team in his freshman season. As a result of his efforts, he was named as an All-Big 12 First Team member, the Big 12 Freshman of the Year, was named as a second-team All-American according to Sporting News, and was also considered a third-team All-American according to the Associated Press and National Association of Basketball Coaches. On April 17, 2017, Jackson officially declared for the 2017 NBA draft and hired former Chicago Bulls point guard B. J. Armstrong as his agent, officially forgoing his remaining college eligibility.\nProfessional career.\nPhoenix Suns (2017–2019).\n2017–18 season.\nOn June 22, 2017, Jackson was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the fourth pick in the 2017 NBA draft, being their second straight selection at pick #4 after Dragan Bender. After he was drafted 4th by Phoenix, it was reported that Jackson had cancelled his workout with the Boston Celtics, who held the 3rd pick after trading the #1 pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, just as the Celtics management and staff were midway to Sacramento to meet him, something that reportedly angered Celtics general manager Danny Ainge, although Ainge denied that it factored into his decision to not draft Jackson. When questioned on it, Ryan McDonough, the general manager of the Suns, did not deny any collusion between the Suns and Jackson's representatives to dissuade the Celtics from drafting Jackson. However, Jackson attributed the situation to nothing more than poor timing and an inability to reschedule for a more proper date. Jackson would sign his rookie scale contract on July 3, 2017. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Jackson recorded averages of 17.4 points, a team high 9.2 rebounds, 1.6 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game at 35.0 minutes per game in the five games (out of the team's six total) he played there, which earned him All-Summer League First Team honors alongside Lonzo Ball, Dennis Smith Jr., John Collins, and Caleb Swanigan.\nJackson made his NBA debut as starting power forward for the Suns on October 18, 2017. During the third game of the season, Jackson made an inappropriate, menacing gesture with his hand towards the fans of the Los Angeles Clippers, which would result in him being fined $35,000 on October 24, 2017. He would start for the Suns at power forward before returning to his more natural small forward position (albeit off the bench) on October 23, 2017 in a win against the Sacramento Kings. On November 29, 2017, Jackson scored a then season-high 20 points in a loss to the Detroit Pistons. Jackson would be put back into a starting position on December 7 at shooting guard after Devin Booker's injury the previous game against the Toronto Raptors. Jackson would record his first double-double of his professional career on January 7, 2018 with 17 points, a season-high 10 rebounds, and a season-high 5 assists in a 114–100 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. After missing their next game against the Houston Rockets due to a strained right hip, he returned to the starting lineup as a small forward on January 14, recording a new career-high 21 points in a blowout loss to the Indiana Pacers. He would tie that career-high on January 31 in a 102–88 win over the Dallas Mavericks before putting up a new season-high with 23 points on February 4 in a 115–110 loss to the Charlotte Hornets. On his 21st birthday, Jackson would have his best all-around game in his rookie season with 20 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, 1 steal and a season-high 4 blocks in a 123–113 loss on the Denver Nuggets. He would break the previous season-high in points with 29 scored on February 28 in a 110–102 win against the Memphis Grizzlies. On St. Patrick's Day, Jackson would break that career-high with the first 30-point game of his professional career with 36 points scored while coming off the bench in a 124–109 loss against the Golden State Warriors. On March 20, 2018, he would record a double-double of 15 points and a career-high 11 rebounds in a loss to the Detroit Pistons. On May 22, 2018, he was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.\n2018–19 season.\nBefore being named an NBA All-Rookie Second Team member, Jackson was the team's representative for the 2018 NBA Draft Lottery; the Suns won the #1 pick for the first time in franchise history on May 15, 2018. He later joined the top pick, Deandre Ayton, and the Suns' other rookies and young players for the 2018 NBA Summer League. During the entire pre-season, Jackson was forced into the role of the leading shooting guard, trying to replicate the role of Devin Booker, who was out at the time due to finger surgery. In the season debut on October 17, 2018, Jackson returned to the bench for the team, as he recorded 18 points on 7/11 shooting, including 3/4 three-pointers made, in a 121–100 blowout win over the Dallas Mavericks.\nMemphis Grizzlies (2019–2020).\nOn July 7, 2019, the Suns traded Jackson to the Memphis Grizzlies. On September 27, the Grizzlies assigned him to the Memphis Hustle, their NBA G League affiliate, for the start of the season. Jackson played in 26 games for the Hustle before being called up by the Grizzlies, averaging 20.3 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.4 blocks, and 1.3 steals per game was named Midseason All-NBA G League for the Western Conference.\nDetroit Pistons (2020–2022).\nOn December 1, 2020, Jackson signed with his hometown team, the Detroit Pistons. He made his debut for the team on December 23, logging 19 points and six rebounds in a 101–111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. On April 1, 2021, Jackson scored a season-high 31 points, alongside four assists, in a 120–91 win over the Washington Wizards. He ended the 2020–21 season averaging a career-high 13.4 points per game.\nOn January 3, 2022, Jackson scored a season-high 24 points, alongside five rebounds, in a 115–106 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.\nSacramento Kings (2022).\nOn February 10, 2022, Jackson and Trey Lyles were acquired by the Sacramento Kings in a four-team trade that sent Marvin Bagley III to the Pistons. The move reunited Jackson with former Suns teammates Richaun Holmes and Alex Len.\nOn August 31, 2022, Jackson signed with the Toronto Raptors. He was waived on October 14.\nStockton Kings (2023).\nOn January 24, 2023, Jackson signed with the Stockton Kings. He was waived four days later.\nOff the court.\nPersonal life.\nJackson was raised by his mother Apples Jones and his stepfather Clarence Jones, who died in 2014 while Jackson was playing in a tournament in Las Vegas.\nJackson's mother was a standout basketball player at the University of Texas at El Paso, transferring there after two years at Allen Community College in Kansas, but was only able to play for one season after being ruled academically ineligible for her senior year leading her to leave UTEP and join the U.S. Navy as a parachute rigger. Following Jackson's birth, Jones was invited to participate in the Washington Mystics training camp but eventually decided against participating, instead choosing to raise Jackson in Michigan.\nJackson has cited chess and saxophone as his off the court passions, having started the chess club at Justin-Siena High School and having played the saxophone since he was in the seventh grade.\nJackson was arrested in Miami at a Rolling Loud concert on May 12, 2019 for allegedly attempting to enter the VIP entrance several times and reportedly attempting to evade police while being arrested. He was also suspended from the Memphis Grizzlies G-League team for violating the team's rules.\nEndorsements.\nOn June 21, the day before the 2017 NBA draft, Jackson signed a multi-year endorsement deal with Under Armour. He was later joined by Mavericks guard Dennis Smith Jr. and Thunder guard Terrance Ferguson as members of the 2017 draft class to sign with Under Armour.\nVandalism case.\nOn February 2, 2017, it was reported by the Kansas City Star that Jackson and Kansas teammate LaGerald Vick were persons of interest in a vandalism case that had occurred the previous December outside a bar in Lawrence. It was alleged that Jackson and Vick had damaged the car of McKenzie Calvert, a KU women's basketball player and Vick's ex-girlfriend. She told police that during the incident outside the bar, Jackson yelled \"for her to get out of the car and that he would beat her ass” prior to damaging her car. Following the investigation by police, Jackson was charged with one count of misdemeanor criminal damage to property and was scheduled to be arraigned on April 12. Following the announcement of the charges, Jackson released a statement apologizing for his role in the incident and offered to pay for damages. Following Jackson's charges, KU basketball coach Bill Self stated that Jackson had been disciplined internally by the administration but would not be suspended for any games due to his actions in the incident.\nAfter pleading not guilty to the vandalism charges, Jackson filed for a diversion agreement in Douglas County Court which would last 12 months. As a part of the agreement, Jackson agreed to complete an anger management course, complete community service, abstain from alcohol and drug use during the diversion period, obtain substance abuse evaluation and write a letter of apology to the victims. He also agreed to pay $250 in restitution, $158 to the court, and $150 for the cost of diversion. Although Jackson originally pleaded guilty, as a part of the diversion agreement he signed a stipulation of facts matching witness accounts of his actions during the incident. Following the successful completion of the diversion program, Jackson's case would be dismissed by the Douglas County Court. When asked about his progress during an interview on June 13, Jackson told reporters that he was nearly finished with the anger management course and that he had learned from his mistake."

        "title": "History of the South Africa national rugby union team",
        "text": " \nThe History of the South Africa national rugby union team dates back to 1891, when the British Lions first toured South Africa where they played against South African representative sides. The South Africa national rugby union team played few international matches during a period of international sanctions due to apartheid. Since the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa has once again fully participated in international rugby.\nThe most iconic moment in South Africa rugby history is when South Africa hosted and won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, with Nelson Mandela presenting the trophy to the team. South Africa also won the 2007 Rugby World Cup. And now, 12 years later again, World Champions and they create history. It is the first black South African to lift SA's third Web Ellis cup, Siya Kolisi. South Africa demolished England in the final 32–12. This is the second time the Bokke faced the English in another final showdown, the last was in 2007 when the Bokke won in a no try game.\nFirst internationals.\nThe first British Isles tour took place in 1891, with the trip financially underwritten by Cape Colony Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes. These were the first representative games played by South African sides, who were still learning the game. The tourists played and won a total of twenty matches, conceding only one point in the process. South Africa's first Tests were played, although South Africa did not exist as political unit until 1910. In a notable event of the tour, the British side presented the Currie Cup to Griqualand West, the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.\nThe British Isles' success continued on their 21-game tour of 1896. The British Isles won three out of the four Tests against South Africa. South Africa's play improved markedly from 1891. Their forwards were particularly impressive, and their first Test win in the final game was a pointer to the future. For the first time South Africa had worn myrtle green shirts, which their captain, Barry Heatlie, borrowed from his Old Diocesans club. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours, which created great interest in the South African press.\nRugby was so popular that in 1902 there was a temporary ceasefire in the Second Boer War so that a game could be played between British and Boer forces. The game had spread among the Afrikaner population through POW games during the Boer War, and afterwards Stellenbosch University became a training ground for future players and administrators.\nIn 1903 the British Isles lost a series for the first time in South Africa, drawing the opening two Tests before losing the last 8–0. In all, the tourists won just 11 of their 22 tour games. By contrast, South Africa would not lose another series—home or away—until 1956.\nSpringboks.\nPaul Roos was the captain of the first South African team to tour the British Isles and France. The team was largely dominated by players from Western Province, and the tour took place during 1906–07. The team played 29 matches; including tests against all four Home Nations. England managed a draw, but Scotland was the only one of the Home unions to gain a victory.\nDuring this tour the nickname \"Springboks\" was first used. There is often confusion as to the springbok symbol being worn before the name was invented, but this may be down to the fact the tour manager, J.C. Carden, spoke of having no 'uniforms or blazers' with the icon, though he did not appear to mean the jerseys. It was reported in the \"Daily Mail\" on 20 September 1906, seven days before the first match, that 'The team's colours will be myrtle green with gold collar... and will have embroidered in mouse-coloured silk on the left breast a Springbok'. Carden later stated:\nNewspaper reporters were to call the team \"De Springbokken\", and later the \"Daily Mail\" printed an article referring to the \"Springboks\". The team thereafter wore blazers with a springbok on the left breast pocket. Research in 1992 showed that the design for a Springbok head which was used on the cap as well as the jumping Springbok for use on the jersey and blazer was designed by a German-born artist Heinrich Egersdörfer, living at the time in Woodstock, Cape Town.\nHistorically the term 'Springbok' was applied to any team or individual representing South Africa in international competition regardless of sporting discipline. This tradition was abandoned with the advent of South Africa's new democratic government in 1994. The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride among South Africans.\nThe South Africans crossed the channel to play an unofficial match against a 'France' team drawn from the two Parisian clubs: Stade Français and Racing Club de France. The official French team were in England at the time. The Springboks won 55–6 and scored 13 tries in the process.\nThe 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa was the first to include representatives from all four Home unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The tourists won just one of their three Tests.\nThe Boks' second European tour took place in 1912–13. They beat the four Home nations to earn their first Grand Slam and also went on to defeat France.\nInter war.\nBy the first World War New Zealand and South Africa had established themselves as rugby's two greatest powers. A New Zealand Army match tour of South Africa in 1919 paved the way for a Springbok tour to New Zealand and Australia in 1921. The tour was billed as \"The World Championship of Rugby\". The All Blacks won the first Test 13–5, which included a try by All Blacks winger Jack Steel who had sprinted 50 metres with the ball trapped between his right hand and back to score. The Springboks recovered to win the second Test 9–5 thanks to a Gerhard Morkel drop-goal. The final Test was drawn 0–0 after being played in terrible conditions—resulting in a series draw.\nThe 1924 British and Irish Lions team to South Africa struggled with injuries and won only nine of 21 games. They lost three Tests to the Springboks, drew one, but despite the results, the tour produced some attractive rugby. This was the first side to pick up the name Lions, apparently picked up from the Lions embroidered on their ties.\nThe All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928, and again the Test series finished level. Despite playing most of the second half with only 14 men, with a dominant scrum and fly-half Bennie Osler, the Springboks won the first Test 17–0 to inflict the All Blacks' heaviest defeat since 1893. The All Blacks rebounded to win the second Test 7–6. After a Springbok win in the third Test, the Springboks needed to win the fourth to secure a series victory. The New Zealanders bought back Mark Nicholls for his only Test of the series, and their captain Maurice Brownlie told the team a week before the Test that \"Under no circumstances whatever is anyone of you so much as to touch a rugby ball until we play the Springboks in the last test.\" Their tactics were successful and the All Blacks won 13–5 to draw the series.\nDespite winning South Africa's second Grand Slam, the Springbok tourists of 1931–32 were an unloved team. They had a jumbo pack and a kicking fly-half in captain Bennie Osler. Their tactics of kicking for territory earned them criticism both in South Africa and abroad. It was successful however, the team winning against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as defeating all their Welsh opponents for the first time.\nIn 1933, Wallabies made a tour in South Africa, After five match, Springboks won the series against Australian (3–2), confirmed themself as the strongest team in the world.\nIn 1937 South Africa toured New Zealand and Australia and broke the deadlock with a series win in New Zealand. Their 2–1 series win prompted them to be called \"the best team to ever leave New Zealand\". Despite the All Blacks winning the first Test, the Springboks' won in the third Test 17–6 and scored five tries to none. The All Blacks' loss was considered a humiliation in New Zealand.\nThe British Isles toured South Africa again in 1938, winning the majority of their tour matches. However, the Springboks secured easy victories in the first two tests, winning 26–12 and 19–3. However, the Lions bounced back to record a 21–16 win in the third test, which was the first Lions win on South Africa soil since 1910.\nPost-war era.\nDanie Craven was appointed coach in 1949, and started his coaching career with a bang. The Springboks won ten matches in a row, including a 4–0 whitewash of New Zealand on their 1949 tour to South Africa.(details of this referencerequired) Prop Okey Geffin helped kick the Springboks to victory—they won all four Tests despite the All Blacks scoring more tries in three of them.\nThe 1951–52 team that toured Europe was considered amongst the finest Springbok sides to tour. The team won the Grand Slam as well as defeating France. Hennie Muller captained the side after original captain Basil Kenyon suffered a serious eye injury. The South African highlight of the tour was a 44–0 defeat of Scotland. The defeat of Scotland included nine tries, and was a record at the time. The team finished with only one loss, to London Counties, from 31 matches.\nIn 1953, Australia toured South Africa for the second time and although they lost the series they were given a standing ovation after defeating South Africa 18–14 in a thrilling 2nd Test at Newlands. Wallaby Captain John Solomon was chaired off the field by two South African players. This was the first Springbok defeat for 15 years.\nDuring their 1955 tour to South Africa, the Lions won 19 and drew one from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series ended in a draw.\nIn 1956, Springboks toured Australasia the All Blacks won its first series over the Springboks, in what Chris Hewett called \"in the most bitterly fought series in history.\" Surprise selection Don Clarke from Waikato—nicknamed \"the Boot\"—kicked the decisive penalties in the final Tests.\nSouth Africa had defeated France 25–3 at Colombes Stadium in 1952, and when France toured South Africa in 1958 they were not expected to compete. Georges Duthen described the mood of the French players before their first Test in 1958: \"They were going into battle. A Battle for France. And they hadn't a hope...\" France exceeded expectations and drew 3–3 with after a drop goal to French scrum-half Pierre Danos and unconverted try to South Africa's Butch Lochner. The French then secured a Test series victory in South Africa with their 9–5 victory in front of 90,000 spectators in Johannesburg. The French feared the South African forwards, especially their scrum, and focused much of their training before the series on improving the \"South African\" style of their forwards. The decisive moment of the match was French forward Jean Barthe's tackle on Jan Prinsloo near the French try-line prevented a certain try. The momentum then swung to France who scored drop-goals—one each to Pierre Lacaze and Roger Martine—to secure the historic victory.\n1960s.\nEven before the apartheid laws were passed after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nēpia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of \"The Wind of Change\" speech and the Sharpeville massacre.\nFrom this point onward, the Springboks were increasingly the target of international controversy and protest. The All Blacks toured in 1960 without their Maori players, who were excluded at the insistence of South Africa. This was controversial in New Zealand, with a \"No Maoris, No Tour\" campaign and a 150,000 signature petition opposing it. The Springboks avenged their 1956 series defeat by winning the Test series 2–1 with a Test drawn. The first match was won 13–0 by the Springboks with two tries to Hennie van Zyl. New Zealand journalist Noel Holmes said after the match \"I hang my head in shame for having suggested that your forwards might be slow, even unfit.\" The All Blacks won the second Test 11–3 which they did so with a dominant forward pack and the tactical kicking of Don Clarke. The players selected for the third and fourth Tests formed the core of Springboks side for the next three seasons. The third Test was drawn 11–11 after a last minute sideline conversion from All Black Don Clarke. The deciding Test was won 8–3 by the Springboks with the decisive try scored by Martin Pelser.\nLater that same year the Springboks themselves toured, and led by Avril Malan they defeated all four Home unions for their fourth Grand Slam. On a four-month, 34-game sweep through Europe they played a ruthless, forward-oriented game in which intimidation was a key part, and opposition players suffered a string of controversial injuries. However, they lost their final game 6–0 against the Barbarians in Cardiff, beaten when perhaps the Barbarians' pack played an uncharacteristically pragmatic game.\nIn 1962 the British Isles, won 16 of their 25 games on their tour to South Africa, but did not do so well in the Tests—losing three of the tests and drawing the other. In 1963 the touring Wallabies beat the Springboks in consecutive Tests, the first team to do so since the 1896 British team.\nWales toured South Africa and played several games and one Test in 1964—their first overseas tour. They lost the Test against South Africa in Durban 24–3, their biggest defeat in 40 years. At the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that \"it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football.\"\nSouth Africa had a disastrous year in 1965, when lost in a short tour losing to Ireland, Scotland, and in a second and long tour to Australia (twice) and New Zealand (three times) while winning just once against New Zealand.\nThe planned \"1967\"' tour by the All Blacks was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union after the South African government refused to allow Maori players.\nIn 1968 the Lions toured and won 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but lost three Tests and drew one.\nNext year the 1969–70, Springbok tour to Britain and Ireland found a new spirit and confidence had developed in Home nations rugby, and the tourists lost two of their seven games in Wales—against Newport and a composite side from Monmouthshire. Wales nearly claimed their first win against the Springboks as the game ended 6–6. The Springboks lost the Test matches against England and Scotland, drawing the one against Ireland. Throughout the tour however, large anti-apartheid demonstrations were a feature, and many matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences.\n1970s.\nIn 1970 the All Blacks toured South Africa once again—after the 1967 stand-off, the South African government now agreed to treat Maoris in the team, and Maori spectators, as 'honorary whites'. The Springboks won the test series 3–1.\nThe Springbok tour of Australia in 1971 began with matches in Perth, then Adelaide and Melbourne. The Springboks won all three Tests, scoring 18–6, 14–6, and 19–11. As in Britain three years before however, massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the team, and they had to be transported by the Royal Australian Air Force after the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. Although a tour of New Zealand had been planned for 1973, it was blocked by New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk on the grounds of public safety.\nThe Lions team that toured South Africa in 1974 led by Willie John McBride was unbeaten over 22 games, and triumphed 3–0 (with one drawn) in the Test series. A key feature was the Lions' infamous '99 call'. Lions management had decided that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, so decided \"to get their retaliation in first\". At the call of '99' each Lions player would attack their nearest rival player. The idea was that a South African referee would be unlikely to send off all of the Lions. At the \"battle of Boet Erasmus Stadium\"—one of the most violent matches in rugby history—JPR Williams famously ran over half of the pitch and launched himself at 'Moaner' van Heerden after such a call.\nThe 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead, and the Springboks won by three Tests to one, but coming shortly after the Soweto riots the tour attracted international condemnation and 28 countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest, and the next year, in 1977, the Commonwealth signed the Gleneagles Agreement, which discouraged any sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. Four years later Errol Tobias would become the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was stopped by the French government, who announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France.\n1980s.\nThe Lions toured South Africa in 1980. The team completed a flawless non-Test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-Test matches on the tour. But they lost the first three Tests before winning the last one.\nThe 1981 tour of New Zealand went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 2–1, but the tour and the massive civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby.\nSouth Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the South American Jaguars to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players, whose national team had struggled to attract strong international opposition. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980s—all awarded Test status.\nIn 1984 England toured losing both test matches on tour. Of the players selected, only Ralph Knibbs of Bristol refused to tour for political reasons.\nIn 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the New Zealand High Court. A rebel tour took place the next year by a team known as the Cavaliers. The team was not sanctioned by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, yet consisted of all but two of the original squad that had been selected. For some of the tests, the team was advertised, inside South Africa as the All Blacks whilst at the others they were advertised as the New Zealand Cavaliers. The Springboks won the series 3–1.\nIn 1989, a World XV sanctioned by the International Rugby Board went on a mini-tour of South Africa. All traditional rugby nations bar New Zealand supplied players to the team with ten Welshmen, eight Frenchmen, six Australians, four Englishmen, one Scot and one Irishman.\n1990s.\nFrom 1990 to 1991 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in 1992. They struggled to return to their pre-isolation standards in their first games after readmission. During the 1992 All Blacks tour, the first to South Africa since 1976, the Springboks were defeated 27–24 by New Zealand on 15 August 1992 and also suffered a 26–3 loss to Australia the following month. Ian McIntosh was sacked as national coach following a series defeat by the All Blacks in New Zealand in mid-1994. In October of that year, Kitch Christie accepted an offer to take over from McIntosh.\nSouth Africa was selected to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup, and there was a remarkable surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities in the lead-up to the tournament. This was the first major event to be held in what Archbishop Desmond Tutu had dubbed \"the Rainbow Nation.\" South Africans of all colours got behind the slogan coined by Edward Griffiths, then CEO of the rugby federation: \"one team, one country\".\nBy the time they hosted the 1995 World Cup, the Springboks were seeded ninth. They defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa and France to play in the final.\nSouth Africa narrowly won the epic 1995 Rugby World Cup Final 15–12 against traditional rivals the All Blacks. A drop goal by Joel Stransky secured victory in extra-time.\nWearing a Springbok shirt, Nelson Mandela presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, a white Afrikaner. The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans. Mandela's enthusiasm and support for the Springboks is portrayed in the 2009 film \"Invictus\". SARFU President Louis Luyt caused controversy at the post-match dinner by declaring that the Springboks would have won the previous two World Cups if they had been allowed to compete. The day after the World Cup victory, the Xhosa word for Springbok, \"Amabokoboko!\" appeared as the headline of The Sowetan's sports page.\nA series of crises followed in 1995 through 1997 as it became clear that South African rugby was an unreformed element of the new Rainbow Nation. The team was also struck by tragedy, as Christie, who had led them to victory in all 14 Tests he coached, was forced to resign in 1996 after battling leukaemia for more than a decade. An on-field slump saw South African sides struggle in the new Super 12 and Tri-Nations competitions. Under new coach John Hart and the captaincy of Sean Fitzpatrick, the All Blacks won a Test series in South Africa for the first time in 1996. Fitzpatrick even rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated. The 1997 Lions completed their South African tour with only two losses in total, winning the Test series two games to one.\nCoach Andre Markgraaff was fired in 1997 over a racial comment he made. Despite a successful career as a player, Markgraaff's replacement Carel du Plessis led the team to successive defeats in the British and Irish Lions 1997 tour and the 1997 Tri Nations Series. He was replaced later in 1997 by Nick Mallett, who went on to coach the unbeaten 1997 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe in late 1997. In 1998 Mallett and new captain Gary Teichmann tied the then-existing record of the 1965–69 All Blacks for longest Test winning streak, winning 17 consecutive Tests, including the 1998 Tri-Nations. In the same year, South Africa mourned as Christie's illness claimed his life.\nDespite indications that the Springboks were a team on the decline prior to the 1999 Rugby World Cup, they reached the semi-finals of the competition, where they lost to eventual champions at Twickenham.\n2000–2009.\nDuring the 2002 tour, at Twickenham in November 2002 England defeated South Africa 53–3, which was their worst ever loss, after Springbok Jannes Labuschagne was red-carded after 23 minutes and the Boks played three-quarters of the match one man short. An increasingly frustrated South African side began physically targeting England players during the match, with footage showing captain Corné Krige as a leader. In the 2002 and 2003 seasons, the Springboks also lost by record margins to France, Scotland and New Zealand. They defeated Argentina by only one point, and were eliminated from the 2003 World Cup in the quarter-final round – their worst ever showing in a World Cup record of two gold and one bronze from five appearances.\nDuring a pre-World Cup training camp, there was a highly publicised dispute between Geo Cronjé (an Afrikaner) and Quinton Davids (a coloured). Both were dropped from the team, and Cronjé was called before a tribunal to answer charges that his actions in the dispute were racially motivated. Cronjé was eventually cleared. Later, the Boks were sent to a military-style boot camp in the South African bush called Kamp Staaldraad (literal English translation \"Camp Steel-wire\", idiomatically \"Camp Barbed Wire\"). After the World Cup, then-coach Rudolf Straeuli was under fire, not only because of the team's poor results, but because of his role in organising Kamp Staaldraad. He eventually resigned, and in February 2004 Jake White was named as new national coach.\nThe Springboks then swept Ireland in a two-Test series and defeated Wales during their opponents' June 2004 tours of the Southern Hemisphere. Next came a win in the most closely contested Tri Nations in history—their only Tri Nations trophy since 1998. In November 2004, the Springboks went on a Grand Slam tour of the Home Nations. They were decisively defeated by England, and lost controversially to Ireland. They then won a hard-fought match against Wales, and prevailed comfortably against Scotland. The Springbok resurgence was honoured with a sweep of the major International Rugby Board awards. The Boks were named Team of the Year, White Coach of the Year, and flanker Schalk Burger Player of the Year.\nIn 2005 the Springboks defeated an embarrassed Uruguay by a world record margin. Zimbabwean-born new cap, Tonderai Chavanga, scored a record six tries in the match, surpassing Stefan Terblanche's previous record of five. The side finished second in the Tri-Nations that year, losing their final match to New Zealand. The springboks thought they had the match before Keven Mealamu scored the match winning try for the All Blacks in the 27–31 loss. The year ended positively with close victories away from home against Argentina, among others.\nWith several new players aboard, the 2006 Springboks defeated Scotland twice in South Africa, before a loss to France ended their long undefeated home record. A bad start to the 2006 Tri Nations Series saw them lose 49–0 to the Wallabies. The Springboks put together better games in the following two matches, losing in the final minutes in the second test against Australia. Answering the call from many South African supporters to play a more expansive style of rugby, coach Jake White fielded a more adventurous team. They broke South Africa's five-game losing streak by beating the All Blacks 21–20 at Royal Bafokeng Stadium. The All Blacks' defeat by the South Africans was their only loss of the year. The highlight of South Africa's tour to Europe was the 24–15 win over England at Twickenham, after a loss to Ireland and one to England the previous week. \nIn July 2006, Springbok coach Jake White told the press he had been unable to pick some white players for his squad \"because of transformation\"—a reference to the ANC government's policies attempting to redress the racial imbalances in national sport.\nRugby World Cup 2007.\nGrouped in Pool A at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, they opened their campaign in Paris with a 59–7 victory over Samoa. Next up was England at the Stade de France, where the Springboks triumphed 36–-0. The third pool game against Tonga in Lens was more competitive and they narrowly won 30–25. The final pool game against the US in Montpellier produced a 64–15 win.\nHaving won all their pool games, they advanced to the quarter-finals to defeat Fiji 37–20 before accounting for Argentina 37–13 in the semi-finals.\nThey prevailed 15–6 over England to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time on 20 October 2007. The Springboks won the match joining Australia as the only other national team, at the time, to have won the trophy twice (New Zealand also won it for a second time in 2011).\nAfter the World Cup.\n2008 was a mixed year for the Springboks. Going into the year as world champions, they were under pressure to perform. In January 2008, Peter de Villiers was appointed as the first non-white coach of the Springboks. De Villiers's first squad included ten of colour and managed two victories against Wales (43–17 and 37–21) and one against Italy (26–0) in Incoming Tours. They had an ultimately disappointing Tri Nations ending up last with only two wins. They did manage a historic triumph in Dunedin, a city in which they had never tasted victory in over 100 years. The Springboks beat Wales and Scotland before thrashing England on the end of year tour.\nThe 2009 season began as one of the more successful. The Boks' 2009 international campaign began with a closely fought 2–1 series win over the Lions. They followed it up with a win in the Tri Nations, sweeping the All Blacks and losing only to the Wallabies in Brisbane, adding the Freedom Cup (against New Zealand) and the Mandela Challenge Plate (against Australia) to their trophy cabinet.\nHowever, the Boks' busy year took its toll when they toured Europe in the November Test window. They lost their top spot in the IRB rankings with a loss to France. The Boks then defeated Italy, but were beaten by Ireland to close out the year.\nNonetheless, the Boks were named IRB International Team of the Year, beating out Six Nations Grand Slam winners Ireland.\n2010–present.\nThe Boks began their 2010 Test campaign on 5 June, defeating Wales 34–31 in Cardiff.\nAfter defeating Wales, the Springboks headed back to Cape Town to play against France, which they won 42–17. The Springbok victory over the French was their first since 2005. Their final preparations for the 2010 Tri-Nations tournament includes two internationals against Italy. In the first test the Springbok team beat Italy by 29–13, and in the second test beat the Azzuri 55–11.\nThe Boks were widely fancied to beat the All Blacks at Eden Park in Auckland in the first Tri-Nations test of 2010. The Boks had only previously won twice at Eden park, the last time being in 1937. However, the first test of the 2010 Tri Nations campaign turned out to be a nightmare for the Boks. They went down 32–12. Since then, the Boks lost consecutive tests to again succeed both the Tri-Nations trophy and Freedom Cup to the world number one ranked All Blacks, as well as lose the Mandela Plate and second place IRB World Ranking to Australia.\nOn 6 November 2010, the Springboks had the honour of being the first Test team to play Ireland at their new home of Aviva Stadium. Because of the historic significance of this match, the Boks had agreed to wear their change strip to allow Ireland to wear their regular green. (Normally, the home team changes in case of a colour clash.) The match was the opener of their first attempted Grand Slam tour since 2004, with the Ireland match followed by encounters with Wales, Scotland and England. The Boks followed the tour up with a match against the Barbarians.\n2011 and the Rugby World Cup.\nThe Springboks kicked off their 2011 test season with controversy, with 21 high-profile players omitted from the away leg of the 2011 Tri Nations, leaving only captain John Smit and Morné Steyn as regular members of the starting XV amongst a largely second-string side. Media sources claimed that the Boks players were simply being rested in preparation for the upcoming World Cup, thus creating outcry that the 2011 Tri Nations was being turned into a farce by the Springboks. The Boks subsequently lost both of their away games. The home leg saw the return of the first-choice players, and the Boks went on to lose to Australia, but win the following week 18–5 against New Zealand. The Springboks finished the 2011 Tri Nations with just the one win.\nThe South Africans entered the 2011 Rugby World Cup drawn in a pool against Wales, Samoa, Fiji and Namibia. Despite a close opening encounter against Wales, which was won 17–16, the Springboks went on to top their group, registering convincing wins against Fiji and Namibia, before winning another close match against Samoa 13–5.\nThe Springboks then faced Australia in a highly controversial quarter-final match, ultimately losing 11–9 and falling out of the tournament. The South African fans and pundits went on to criticise New Zealand referee Bryce Lawrence for \"one-sided\" refereeing, claiming that Australian openside David Pocock was allowed to \"reduce the breakdown to a farce\". Lawrence was dropped from the nine-man elite panel in 2012.\nFollowing the World Cup exit, several stalwarts of the 2007 World Cup-winning side and the 2011 squad went on to announce retirements or moves abroad. This included captain John Smit, influential lock pairing Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha, and scrum-half Fourie du Preez."

It is part of The New York Rowing Association which was founded in 1914, and has its roots in the Harlem Regatta Association which dates back to 1866.\nIts first clubhouse was a one-story shed on the edge of Mill Pond and Church Street. In 1882 the club moved from its original site on Pelham Road, to its present location at the east end of Davenport Neck on Echo Bay. The first building at this site was lost to fire around 1900 and was immediately replaced by the current two-story clubhouse. The building is topped by an 1864 clock tower that was removed from the former city hall on Main Street when it was demolished in the 1960s. Club members restored the cupola and added it to the building in 1974.\nIn 1886 the young club defeated the renowned New York Athletic Club, winning its first rowing competition. The sport of rowing became significantly more popular starting in the 1880s. In its early years, the New Rochelle Rowing Club’s Annual Regatta attracted as many as 1000 members and spectators to the events on Echo Bay. As the club expanded, the club bought new boats, including new four oared gigs with which they went on to claim more racing titles. The popularity of eight oared rowing did not hit until 1908 when they borrowed a boat from the New York Athletic Club and won a major match race. Over the years, the club has won three national rowing championships. The national Intermediate Single Sculls title in 1920, another National title was captured in 1947, and a third in 1964. The club has also participated in numerous major meets. It was the home club of Cy Cromwell and Jim Storm, silver medalists in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nSuperstorm Sandy slammed New Rochelle's waterfront, with Hudson Park and its facilities bearing much of the brunt. The strong tidal surge heavily damaged the hundred-year-old NRRC clubhouse resulting in its questionable future. Calls for renovation and preservation of the structure as well as those for total demolition continue nearly two years after the hurricane."

        "title": "Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas",
        "text": "Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. (lit. Volleyball Sport in the Philippines) was the national sport association for volleyball in the Philippines between 2015 and January 2021. It was recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), the Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC) and provisionally recognized by the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB). In 2021, the newly formed Philippine National Volleyball Federation became recognized by the POC, AVC and FIVB as the national sport association for volleyball in the Philippines.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nLarong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. (LVPI) was formed in a restructuring effort by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) through their president Peping Cojuangco following a power struggle which emerged at the formerly POC-recognized Philippine Volleyball Federation (PVF) due to two colliding factions between the group of PVF president Edgardo \"Boy\" Cantada and the group of PVF secretary general Karl Chan and PVF managing director Otie Camangian, but it was later reconciled and united.\nLVPI was formed together with four of the Manila-based major stakeholders - the UAAP, the NCAA, the Shakey's V-League/Spikers' Turf (under Sports Vision Management Group, Inc.) and the Philippine Super Liga (under SportsCore Events Management). Provincial stakeholders were purportedly snubbed for joining the LVPI due to current alignment with the PVF.\nThe POC withdrew its recognition of the PVF when it learned that there were two registrations with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the same name (the old 2005 recognition and the updated 2014 recognition).\nLVPI was incorporated by POC 1st vice-president, Team Philippines Chef de mission for the 2016 Rio Olympics and Asian Volleyball Confederation Board Member Joey Romasanta, POC (and University of Perpetual Help System) official Ret. Army Col. Jeff Tamayo, POC legal counsel Atty. Ramon Malinao, POC official Marine B/Gen. Benjamin \"Chippy\" Espiritu, and former Ateneo de Manila University athletics director and Sports Vision president Richard Palou with the intent of replacing PVF as the national sport association for volleyball in the Philippines. The POC received a letter dated January 27, 2014, from the FIVB indicating that it is giving provisional membership to the newly formed LVPI. The FIVB required LVPI to hold an election not before February 15, 2015.\nLVPI was introduced to the public during the opening day of the 2015 season of the Philippine Super Liga and also during the drawing of the lots for the 2015 Asian U23 Women's Volleyball Championship last March 6, 2015, despite the backlash by the current PVF president Cantada against the forming of the new volleyball NSA by the POC. Cantada claimed that the PVF is still the recognized NSA for volleyball in the country, and that the withdrawal of the recognition of the PVF by the POC is illegal and not due process.\nRomasanta, together with former Philippine Amateur Volleyball Association (PAVA, the predecessor of the PVF) president Victorico \"Concoy\" Chaves, leads the executive board of LVPI, together with Palou, Ariel Paredes, Tamayo, Peter Cayco, Ramon \"Choy\" Cojuangco Jr., and Sherwin Malonzo, among others in the presence of AVC secretary general Shanrit Wongsaprert and AVC development and marketing chairman Ramon Suzara. The first order of business for the group after their formal recognition to the AVC, is the payment of the 3 million peso debt ($80,000 from FIVB and $10,000 from Thailand Volleyball Association) of the former PAVA administration (under Roger Banzuela, which Palou and Suzara were members of the PAVA board) to the FIVB during the Manila's hosting of the 2005 Grand Prix.\nOn April 23, 2015, the PVF filed a temporary restraining order and petition for preliminary mandatory injunction against the LVPI citing the group's \"malicious intent\" against the PVF. A decision was set to be issued before the end of the year.\nIn a meeting held last May 12, 2015, presided by FIVB President Ary Graca, the FIVB officially gave its full recognition to the LVPI as the legitimate and exclusive authority for volleyball in the Philippines (without given time to the general assembly), Former FIVB and AVC president Wei Jizhong was part in witnessing the formation and given recognition for LVPI by the international governing bodies.\nOn July 29, 2015, the POC issued its letter of recognition to the LVPI as regular member of the local Olympic body in compliance to the requirements of the Membership and Accreditation Committee.\nDevelopments.\nLVPI sent different teams (with different players compositions and coaches) to represent the Philippines in all competitions within 2015 (except the Asian Men's Seniors where they backed out due to lack of funds), including the Asian Men's U23 and Asian Women's U23, Asian's Women's Seniors, 2015 SEA Games (comeback after 10 years) and the 2015 VTV Cup, which the PVF's Amihan and Bagwis program have planned to play before the LVPI intervened. Those teams were disbanded by the LVPI management due to its poor performance in the competitions. The organization also supported the Cignal HD Spikers and Petron Blaze Spikers on their stints in the 2015 Asian Men's and Women's Club Volleyball Championships.\nLVPI has partnered with the Philippine Marines 7th Marine Brigade (Reserve) to organize volleyball clinics in South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi towards peace and development but it is under drawing stages. In October 2015, LVPI together with the FIVB conducted a level 2 coaching seminar instructed by course director Shanwen Zhao of China and course instructor Razieh “Samira” Seifzadeh of Iran at the Arellano University Gym, attended by 12 volleyball coaches, including Oliver Almadro of Ateneo Men's Team and Kung Fu Reyes of the UST and Philippine Army Women's teams as preparation for the formation of the coaches commission to be headed by LVPI board member Ramon Malinao. In December 2015, the LVPI also sent four representatives, Anna Tomas, Kyle Principe, Abac Cordero and Marc Anthony Reyes, to the inaugural AVC Press Seminar held in Bangkok, Thailand.\nAmong its plans for 2016 were the formation of the commissions for coaches, referees and the athletes and looking for private sponsors to fund the national team and other projects within the scope of LVPI. The organization also focused on the formation of the permanent national team training pool that will restrict players (initially, from 19 years old below - for the Asian U19 and possibly, the FIVB U19 championships) for playing in too many leagues and exhibition games, this will be patterned to the Gilas Cadets program of the SBP and the expansion of their activities to the provinces. Eventually, some of the U19 players will compete also in the 2017 SEA Games and the Asian Seniors. President Romasanta confirmed that the PSL will support the formation of the national pool. It will also use the Arellano University Gym in Pasay, as their main office (from its original location in POC office in Pasig) and the national training center for the LVPI-formed national volleyball teams. It will also serve as a venue for different events and seminars for referees and coaches. LVPI has also appointed managing director Benjamin Espiritu to oversee the adjustments in the volleyball calendar between the four stakeholders of the federation starting in 2016.\nTop LVPI officials Romasanta, Palou, Cayco and Suzara went to the AVC Congress 2015 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in November 2015 to formally seal the hosting rights of the 2016 Asian Women's Club Volleyball Championships in Manila and the appointment of Romasanta as the board member, and re-election of Suzara as the Development and Marketing Chairman. AVC has also offered the hosting rights to the Philippines for the 2017 Asian Seniors Women's Volleyball Championship.\nIn 2016, the BEST Center's Women's Volleyball League was officially accredited as a stakeholder of LVPI. Also in the same year, the Beach Volleyball Republic officially gets pivotal support from the organization after the successful staging of its Nationwide Tour, the National Championships and the Invitationals held in Anguib Beach, Cagayan in June 2016.\nControversies.\nIn a board meeting held in July 2015, LVPI secretary-general Ricky Palou was cited and accused of misrepresenting himself as LVPI President in documents submitted to the FIVB and AVC. In these documents, he sought permission from both bodies to form a beach volleyball tournament without the consent of LVPI board. He was also accused of sealing deals with Solar Sports to cover this event, again without the knowledge and consent of the LVPI board. Palou also insisted on sending the Ateneo Lady Eagles in the 28th SEA Games, instead of the newly formed team with players from 4 stakeholders (as approved by Romasanta). He also instigated the protest against Indonesia's April Manganang over claims of being a hermaphrodite. Palou was also responsible in sending the wrong team roster sent to the Asian Women's Senior Championships in May 2015, as well as the appointments of Roger Gorayeb and Nes Pamiliar as coaches, replacing Thai coach Anusorn Bundit, for the national team in the 2015 VTV Cup, again without the permission of the board. In a caucus, Palou pointed out his assistant Sherwin Malonzo as responsible to the mess. The LVPI board has since decided to honor the deal brokered between Palou and Solar Sports in order to avoid facing legal charges.\nIn October 2015, PVF President Cantada, condemned the act of the LVPI and Score (headed by Ramon Suzara, the president of PSL, and one of the masterminds in the withdrawal of recognition of PVF in the POC, AVC, and FIVB) over the incident involving 12 imports of the Philippine Super Liga Grand Prix who have gone through the immigration process and play in the league without any necessary working permits and other documents for foreigners who will work in the country. He also criticized LVPI and Suzara for blatant disregard and abuse of the Philippine immigration and labor laws over the incident.\nIn October 2016, the LVPI was retained as the National Sports Association for Volleyball in the Philippines as the FIVB started their probe on the expulsion of the PVF, which is one of the main topics of the 35th FIVB World Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results of the investigation will be released in two years' time during the 37th FIVB World Congress, according to LVPI President Romasanta. Vice President Peter Cayco represented LVPI in the event.\nOfficials.\nElected last August 2, 2018."

        "text": "The men's single sculls competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was held from 6 to 13 August at the Lagoon Rodrigo de Freitas. There were 32 competitors from 32 nations. The event was won by Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand, the sixth man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the event. He won an exceptionally close final against Damir Martin of Croatia. Martin's silver was Croatia's first medal in the event. Bronze went to Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic. Both Drysdale and Synek earned their third medal in the event; Drysdale had taken bronze in 2008 before winning in 2012 and 2016, while Synek had twice been the runner-up in 2008 and 2012 before this third-place finish.\nThe measurer noted Martin as the winner with photo finish, while Drysdale as second, but then the result was removed. They had the same final time, 6 minutes 41.34 seconds, and the winner, Drysdale, was decided with a photo finish (five thousandths of a second) by judges. The Croatian Olympic Committee disputes the photo finish, and officially requested the International Olympic Committee and International Rowing Federation for an analysis by independent experts of the entire video and photo finish.\nBackground.\nThis was the 27th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nFour of the 12 A/B semifinalists from the 2012 Games returned, including the three medallists: gold medallist (and 2008 bronze medallist) Mahé Drysdale of New Zealand, two-time silver medallist Ondřej Synek of the Czech Republic, bronze medallist (and 2008 fifth-place finisher) Alan Campbell of Great Britain, and seventh-place finisher Ángel Fournier of Cuba. The favourites were Synek and Damir Martin of Croatia; Synek had won the three World Championships since the 2012 Games while Martin had won the last two European championships. Drysdale had been World runner-up in 2014 and 2015 as well as adding two more Diamond Challenge Sculls titles. \nBelarus, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Thailand, and Vanuatu each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its 22nd appearance, most among nations.\nQualification.\nNations had been limited to one boat (one rower) each since 1912. The 32 qualifiers were:\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event is a single scull event, meaning that each boat is propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower uses two oars, one on each side of the boat; this contrasts with sweep rowing in which each rower has one oar and rows on only one side (not feasible for singles events). The competition consists of multiple rounds. The competition continued to use the five-round format introduced in 2012. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nDuring the first round six heats were held. The first three boats in each heat advanced to the quarterfinals, while all others were relegated to the repechages.\nThe repechage was a round which offered rowers a second chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. Placing in the repechage heats determined which quarterfinal the boat would race in. The top two boats in each repechage heat moved on to the quarterfinals, with the remaining boats going to the E/F semifinals.\nThe quarterfinals were the second round for rowers still competing for medals. Placing in the quarterfinal heats determined which semifinal the boat would race in. The top three boats in each quarterfinal moved on to the A/B semifinals, with the bottom three boats going to the C/D semifinals.\nSix semifinals were held, two each of A/B semifinals, C/D semifinals, and E/F semifinals. For each semifinal race, the top three boats moved on to the better of the two finals, while the bottom three boats went to the lesser of the two finals possible. For example, a second-place finish in an A/B semifinal would result in advancement to the A final.\nThe fourth and final round was the finals. Each final determined a set of rankings. The A final determined the medals, along with the rest of the places through 6th. The B final gave rankings from 7th to 12th, the C from 13th to 18th, and so on. Thus, to win a medal rowers had to finish in the top three of their heat (or top two of their repechage heat), top three of their quarterfinal, and top three of their A/B semifinal to reach the A final.\nSchedule.\nAll times are Brasília Time ().\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first three of each heat qualified for the quarterfinals, while the remainder went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe first two in each heat qualified for the quarterfinals; the rest went to Semifinals E/F (out of medal contention).\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualified for Semifinals A/B; the remainder went to Semifinals C/D (out of medal contention).\nSemifinals.\nThe first three of each heat qualify to the better final (E, C, A) while the remainder went to the lower final (F, D, B)."

The team is a member of the Mid-American Conference East Division competing in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Bobcats have played their home games in the Convocation Center since 1973.\nHistory.\nOhio University's women’s basketball program began its unofficial debut in 1965. It was created by the Women’s Sports and Recreation Department (WRA) chapter of Ohio University. The team, led by Bev Smith, competed for 8 years before they became a part of the Women’s Intercollegiate Athletics (WICA) organization. This marked the beginning of funding from athletics as opposed to education.\nUpon its official debut, the women’s basketball team played their first game in the 1973–74 season. The Bobcats have won three Mid-American Conference tournament titles in 1986, 1995, and 2015. They have been MAC regular season champions four times, most recently in the 2015–16 season.

Their coach, 23-year-old Amy Prichard, became the first Ohio head coach to be awarded the honor of the MAC Coach of the Year.\nThe Bobcats' current head coach is Bob Boldon. Boldon played college basketball at Walsh University from 1993–97. After debuting during the 2013–14 season, Boldon's team posted a record of 9–20. During his second season at Ohio University, he led the Bobcats to their first winning season since the 2007–08 season. Boldon led the team to the MAC championship, clinching a spot in the 2015 NCAA tournament. The team lost in the first round to Arizona State, by a score of 74–55. In the 2018-19 season the Bobcats won 30 games, being the first basketball team to do so between both Bobcat men's and women's programs.\nSeasonal Results.\nas of 3/13/2024\nPostseason results.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Bobcats have appeared in three NCAA Tournaments. Their combined record is 0-3.\nWomen's National Invitation Tournament results.\nOhio has been selected to participate in five Women's National Invitation Tournaments.

Some Ohio traditions include:\nAll-time records.\nAll-time coaching records.\nAs of 3/13/2024\nAll-time MAC records.\nThe Bobcats have won 2 Mid-American Conference tournament titles in 1986, and 2015 as well as 4 MAC regular-season titles in 1986, 1995, 2015, and 2016.

The school was established in 1910 by the Lowry Bill and the first classes were held on the new campus in 1913 after the completion of the first building, Merrill Hall. Classes had begun as early as 1912, held at locations around the region. The initial enrollment for the fall 1913 semester was 140 students, of which only five were men, though more students, including additional men, arrived in the coming weeks. The school's largely female enrollment, typical for a teacher training school, participated in a number of intramural sports.\nThe men's basketball team played a schedule of nine games in late 1913 and early 1914, all against local high school, church, and company teams. Games were held in a variety of locations in Kent as a permanent gymnasium was not built on campus until 1925. There was not yet an established nickname for teams from the school, and the school colors were the original orange and blue. Alexander Whyte, the campus custodian, served as head coach. Leo Welsh served as team captain with Martin Billings as manager.\nEarly basketball games were held in various locations, such as the atrium of the original Administration Building (known as Cartwright Hall since 2006), in the basement of the original heating plant, and in the local Congregational Church gymnasium."

        "text": "An English cricket team led by Lord Hawke toured North America in September and October 1894 and two of its matches are considered to have been first-class. This was the second tour to North America led by Hawke: he had previously led a side there in 1891–92 and three of the players from the earlier tour, not including Hawke, were also on this second one.\nThe team played six matches in all, five of them in the United States and one in Canada. The games against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia were of three days' duration, though the second was finished inside two days, and are considered first-class. Other games in New York, Toronto and Lowell, Massachusetts, were each scheduled for two days and are not considered first-class; the match in Lowell was finished inside a single day and an exhibition game, also not first-class, was played on the second day without a result.\nThe team.\nHillyard, McAlpine and Wright had been part of Lord Hawke's previous team to North America in 1891–92.\nThe tour.\nHawke's team left London on 8 September 1894, sailing from Southampton that day. At the time of the departure, the team was expected to be playing matches in \"New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Boston\" and to be returning home by 1 October. The tour was in fact extended by a couple of weeks with a visit to Canada, but a report in England indicates that it was not entirely a success: \"The English cricketers in America are losing their power to attract, there is a decrease in the number of spectators at their matches with their Yankee opponents, their doings appear to excite less interest, and their victories are not so much taken to heart as they used to be,\" said a note in the \"Cheltenham Chronicle\" newspaper. \"Cricket is losing its hold upon the American public, who having gone wild over the short and exciting game of baseball, are losing all taste for our prosaic natural [sic] pastime.\"\nNot all the team came back together: newspapers record the arrival of eight members of the team in Southampton on 17 October 1894.\nFirst-class matches.\nTwo first-class matches were played on the tour, both of them against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia side. McAlpine was omitted from the team for both of these matches.\nOther games.\nThere were three other matches, each of two days' duration, scheduled on the tour, none of them first-class. The team began with a 12-a-side match against an \"All New York\" team at the Staten Island Cricket Club ground: Hawke's side batted for the whole of the first day and the second was lost entirely to rain. The first-class matches in Philadelphia came next, after which the side headed for Toronto and a two-day game against a \"Gentlemen of Canada\" side which was drawn. In what was intended to be the final game of the tour, the team played a Massachusetts side, with Hawke's team 12-strong and the Americans 15; the numbers did not help and the touring team triumphed by an innings inside a single day. A \"fill-up\" single innings match was arranged for the vacant second day, but this match appears not to have been completed, and the scorecard does not give full detail of the home side."

        "text": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines represents Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in international rugby union as the men's national team. It is ranked 81st in the world, as of 16 January 2023.\nHistory.\nThe St. Vincent and the Grenadines Rugby Union (SVGRU) came into existence on Sunday 18 January 1998, when the first game of touch rugby was played at the Sion Hill playing field using four traffic cones as pitch markers.\nIt all came about following a chance conversation. This stimulated an expatriate Englishman, John Townend, to return form his Christmas vacation in 1997 with plenty of enthusiasm and two rugby balls. John Townend contacted two Antipodean expatriates: Kelly Glass, a highly accomplished rugby player from South Island, New Zealand, and Geoff Hyde, an Australian tourism adviser, suggesting a game of touch rugby the following Sunday morning. There were seven players at the first game: Carver Alexander, Ernst De Freitas, Kelly Glass, Kirk Hobson-Garcia, Geoff Hyde, John Townend and Delon Williams, a local Rastafarian who later became known as “Speedy”.\nAfter playing for two hours, the group retired to Villa Beach with a crate of beer, to re-hydrate (any excuse would do) and to soothe aching muscles in the sea. Rugby had been introduced to St. Vincent.\nFrom the early days there was a strong interest from girls, who took an instant liking to the idea of “touch” rugby. The games then continued every Sunday, and it was soon found that between Kirk, Kelly, Andrew, and Scott Hadley that there were already some excellent and accomplished players on the island. In addition, they were able to attract other good players, namely Derek Hadley who was visiting from Australia and Father Pope Faifal from Samoa, working with the Catholic mission. In terms of the girls, Jackie De Freitas soon joined, together with some Canadian volunteers, namely Janice Madill and Lisa Lilajehto. One other girl who was to become a big favourite was Loretta “Hot Lips” Skrok. She became notorious for her trick of taking a swig of strong rum and “flame throwing” at parties. Peace Corps Volunteers Becky Buster and Maria Caluag also became great team members. The local ranks were swelled by the contribution of Lorna “Turbo” Williams from Overland in the Carib community, Delia King from Calliaqua and Yvonne Bakker from Kingstown.\nIn the early days they were definitely seen as an expatriate group of Americans, Australians, British, Canadians, New Zealanders, Trinidadians, Samoans, and a few Vincentians. Rugby was definitely perceived as a white man's sport and a relatively rough game at that. It was soon expanded to playing on Wednesday afternoons as the numbers rose and transferred Sunday practices to Saturday. Despite the expatriate character it was the Vincentians, notably Andrew Hadley and Jackie De Freitas who took the early lead in developing the club, with help from Geoff Hyde.\nSVG Rugby has a significant history of developing home grown talent. In the amateur era the female structure was highly successful, producing a large number of first team players and internationals. In the transition to the professional era it was recognized that a clear development program was needed to develop “complete” players capable of playing professional rugby at the highest level. A key difference between amateur and professional rugby is the physical demands placed on players.\nThey decided to call the team \"Amazona Guildingii\" after the rare and graceful Vincentian parrot, and selected the national colours of green, yellow and blue for their jerseys and shorts. Soon afterwards those that could afford it, purchased their own uniforms. Their motto is to \"Strive to excellence and keep on striving til the end.\"\nMatches and results.\nThe first game ever played was against the British Royal Navy destroyer , on 8 February 1998. The game was won by the home side.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines attempted to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, playing the first match of the Americas qualifying tournament. They played a preliminary qualifier against Saint Lucia in May 2005. The winner would progress to the South Pool of Round 1a, however, Saint Lucia won the match 36-25.\nOn March 29, 2008, Saint Vincent was defeated by Mexico 47-7 in a pre-qualifier for the right to enter the NAWIRA region qualifying process for Rugby World Cup 2011.\nSquad.\nSquad to 2012 NACRA Championship 23 June 2012"

Fuller attributed the change in his status on the team due to an improved work ethic resulting from a desire to honor his father's memory after his death that May. Fuller told \"USA Today\" that he was thinking about transferring, unhappy due to his lack of playing time when his sick father changed his mind \"My dad told me I'm not a quitter\", Fuller said. \"He told me I'm going to fight for everything I've got.

        "title": "Bowling Tunnel",
        "text": "Bowling Tunnel is a railway Tunnel on the Calder Valley line, south of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England. The Tunnel was completed in 1850 after some difficulty in construction, and allowed trains from the south to access the second railway terminus in the town of Bradford. The Tunnel remains open to railway traffic with trains between Halifax and Bradford Interchange using it.\nHistory.\nA tunnel through the hill at Bowling was first suggested for a line linking Leeds with Bradford in 1843, however, George Stephenson advised against this line due to the presence of old coal workings in the hill, which would hinder progress and allow water ingress from old mines. A line between Halifax and Bradford, as part of the Manchester &amp; Leeds Railway, was proposed in 1840s and by the time the line was built, it was under the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway.\nThe contractors for the tunnel, John Moulson &amp; Son, were based at Bowling, and during the construction process, over of earth had been removed with ten shafts built downwards to dig the tunnel out. The tunnel was completed on 22 March 1850, and three shafts were left in-situ to help vent steam from the tunnel, the deepest shaft being deep. Two deaths were attributed to the building of the tunnel, with the local press marvelling that more were not killed, such was the undertaking. The engineer for the project was John Hawkshaw. \nOn 19 April 1850, the government inspector travelled over the line through the tunnel and he approved the construction for opening on 1 May 1850, However, the first revenue earning traffic through the tunnel to Bradford Drake Street (later renamed Exchange), didn't go through until 9 May 1850. Until the tunnel was opened, railway traffic terminated at , and passengers were conveyed to Bradford in a horse-drawn carriage. One statistic that emerged at the time was that the tunnel was long enough to hold over 128,000 people, more than lived in Bradford at that time. Just outside of the northern portal, was Bowling Junction station, which provided access to the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax's railway line to Leeds via Stanningley. The station closed in December 1951 and the line remained open for trains avoiding the reversal at Bradford Interchange until September 1985, however, it became a long siding to Bowling Junction with no access to railway station at its eastern end.\nThe tunnel is (or ) long and is orientated in a north/south direction. The gradient in the tunnel falls at 1-in-400 northwards, towards Bradford Interchange station. In 1973, the M606 motorway was opened, which has its terminal roundabout on top of Bowling Tunnel."

        "title": "Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "The ice hockey (hockey) competitions of the 2018 Winter Olympics were played at two venues within the Gangneung Coastal Cluster in Gangneung, South Korea. The Gangneung Hockey Centre, which seats 10,000, and the Kwandong Hockey Centre, which seats 6,000, were both originally scheduled to be completed in 2016 but appear to have been completed in early 2017. Both venues contain Olympic-sized rinks ().\nTwelve teams competed in the men's tournament, which was held from 14 to 25 February, while eight teams competed in the women's tournament, from 10 to 22 February. In a historic deal, the women's tournament featured a combined Korean team with an expanded roster.\nMen's tournament.\nThe tournament featured 12 countries, eight qualifying through the IIHF World Ranking, 3 through subsequent qualifying tournaments, and the host South Korea men's national ice hockey team. The format were the same as 2010 and 2014; three groups of four competed in three games to determine seeding, each playing every other team in their group, followed by four rounds of elimination games. Each group winner received a bye into the second round, along with the highest ranked of the remaining teams. The remaining eight teams played an eliminating qualification game to advance to the quarter-final round. Each quarter-final winner advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing for the gold medal and the losers playing for the bronze.\nQualification.\nQualification was determined by the IIHF World Ranking following the 2015 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships. The top eight teams in the World Ranking received automatic berths into the Olympics, the host received an automatic berth, and the remaining teams competed to qualify for the remaining three spots. In April 2014 René Fasel indicated that the Koreans would need a ranking of 18th or better but in September of the same year the policy was apparently changed to guarantee the host a position.\nNHL players.\nOn 3 April 2017, the National Hockey League (NHL) announced that its players would not be made available for selection for the national teams in the 2018 Winter Olympics, marking the first time since 1998 that NHL players would be prohibited from participating in the Olympic men's ice hockey tournament. While it was \"open to hearing from any of the other parties who might have an interest in the issue\", the NHL \"confirmed that it [had] no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\". The main disagreement between the NHL, IIHF, and IOC appears to have been over who would cover the cost of indemnifying the NHL players participating in the Games. Even though the IOC had paid to insure NHL players for the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, at a cost of $14 million, the commission was unwilling to do so for Pyeongchang, due to concerns that this would set a precedent and other professional sports bodies might expect similar treatment.\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman explained that another factor in the decision was the IOC's refusal to allow the NHL to promote its players' involvement in the Olympics. He noted that the NHL does not directly profit from their presence in the Olympics and that the IOC's ambush marketing rules make it difficult for the league to capitalize on its players' participation, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics\".\nFollowing the decision to ban its players from selection for the national Olympic teams, the NHL secured the cooperation of the International Ice Hockey Federation and the IOC, who agreed to draw up a \"blacklist\" of players under NHL contract to help prevent national teams from nominating or accepting these players to their Olympic rosters. Consequently, the league did not schedule a break in its 2017–18 season to accommodate the Olympics. The league was required to accommodate an extended midseason break anyway because of its all-star game and league-wide bye week; to prevent players from defying the ban, the NHL scheduled the all-star game (which it traditionally does not contest in Olympic years) and league-wide bye in January.\nThe American Hockey League (AHL), a minor professional league that largely acts as a development league for the NHL, stated that it would allow its players to be loaned to national teams for the duration of the Olympics, although like the NHL, there would not be a break in the season for the Games. CBC Sports reported that AHL players under two-way contracts with NHL affiliates would still be prohibited from attending, but deputy commissioner Bill Daly initially denied the claim. Two weeks later, Daly reversed his position and confirmed that AHL players on two-way contracts would in fact be prohibited from the Olympics.\nIn July, American television company NBC Sports announced that it would not air any NHL games during the Winter Olympics on any of its national networks. However, in January they added three NHL noon games on NBC.\nIn contrast to the NHL, the vast majority of European leagues did include an Olympic break in their 2017–18 season: Russia-based KHL had a 33-day break; Sweden-based SHL took a 14-day break; Switzerland-based NL took 25 days; German-based DEL included a 26-day break; Czech Republic-based Extraliga took 18 days; and Slovakia-based Tipsport liga's break lasted for 14 days. Conversely, Finland-based SM-liiga did not accommodate a break, but allowed its top players to leave the clubs and participate in the Olympic Games.\nWomen's tournament.\nThe women's tournament ran from 10 to 22 February with eight nations competing. The format was the same as 2014. The top 4 seeded teams played in group A and the next four in group B. The top two seeds from group A received a bye from the quarterfinal round. The bottom two group A teams played the top two group B teams in the quarterfinal round. The winner of these two games played the top two group A teams in the semifinal round. The winners of the semifinal round played for the gold medal and the losers played for the bronze.\nQualification.\nQualification was determined by the IIHF World Ranking following the 2016 IIHF Women's World Championship. The top five teams in the World Ranking received automatic berths into the Olympics. South Korea gained direct entry by being host and all other teams competed to qualify for the remaining two spots.\nAttendance.\nThe 2018 Winter Olympic Ice hockey tournament saw a total of 223,892 spectators. The Men's tournament, specifically, had a total of 138,327 spectators across the 30 game event, and the Women's tournament had 85,565 spectators across the 22 game event. The tournaments were played in two locations, the Gangneung Hockey Centre, and the Kwandong Hockey Centre. The Gangneug Hockey Centre has a maximum capacity of 10,000 spectators. The Kwandong Hockey Centre has a maximum capacity of 6,000 spectators.\nAt the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, ice hockey tournament, there was an average attendance of 4,610 spectators for the men's tournament, and 3,889 spectators for the women's tournament. The top four teams with the highest attendance for the men's tournament were, respectively, Korea, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the United States. For the women's tournament, the most attended games were, respectively, the United States, Korea, Finland, and Canada.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 496 athletes from 14 nations (including the IOC's designation of Olympic Athletes from Russia) were scheduled to participate (the numbers of athletes are shown in parentheses). The IOC initially admitted 13 men's or women's teams to compete. Later, North Korean athletes were rostered to participate in the women's tournament alongside South Korean athletes in a combined women's Korean team. Men's rosters can be made up of 25 players, while women's rosters can consist of up to 23. The Czech, German, Norwegian, Slovakian, and Slovenian teams entered only the men's competition, while the Japanese team alone entered only the women's competition. All other teams played in both tournaments."

        "text": "The 2015 Kentucky Derby was the 141st running of the Kentucky Derby. The race was run at 6:44 pm Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on May 2, 2015, at Churchill Downs. It was broadcast in the United States on the NBC television network. Kentucky native Ashley Judd voiced the opening for the telecast of the race, and was the first woman to do so.\nThe weather was warm, and a record 170,513 people attended. The 2015 race also set a wagering record with parimutuel betting of $137.9 million. Jockey Victor Espinoza rode American Pharoah to victory after taking the lead in the homestretch. The race marked the fourth Kentucky Derby win for horse trainer Bob Baffert and the third win for Espinoza.\nQualification.\nThe Kentucky Derby is a race for 3-year-old Thoroughbred horses. The 2015 field was determined by a points system that was introduced in 2013.\nField.\nThe post position draw of the entries for the Kentucky Derby was held on Wednesday, April 29, 2015, at the Churchill Downs Racetrack clubhouse. American Pharoah was installed as the 5-2 morning line favorite. The day after the draw, Todd Pletcher scratched Stanford, stating that the horse was \"fine\" but they were not pleased with the draw and had been \"on the fence\" about running in the Derby. On May 1, El Kabeir was scratched due to a possible hoof problem; however, the also-eligible Tale of Verve did not get a chance to run since the scratch was made after the cutoff time that allows also-eligible runners to start in the race. Early on race day, International Star was also scratched after having problems with his left-front foot.\nOverall, the 2015 field was considered \"the deepest and most talented in decades\". Trainer Bob Baffert had the top two favorites: American Pharoah and Dortmund. Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, was 6–0 entering the race, a feat matched by 1977 winner Seattle Slew and 2004 winner Smarty Jones. American Pharoah was 4–1, having placed fifth in his debut before running off four straight victories, including an eight-length win in the Arkansas Derby. Baffert described the experience as like being \"on pins and needles all week long\", as reporters and fans expected one of his two horses to win.\nOther notable horses in the field included the undefeated Florida Derby winner Materiality; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; UAE Derby winner Mubtaahij; and Sunland Derby winner Firing Line, who had lost to Dortmund twice by very narrow margins.\nRace description.\nThe weather on race day, May 2, 2015, was warm. A record setting 170,513 fans watched the race live at Churchill Downs. The 2015 race also set a record for money wagered with $137.9 million bet from all sources on the Derby and $194.3 million for the entire day of racing. Eighteen horses started the race, which was the eleventh on the race card and started at 6:43 p.m. Television viewership was also higher than in previous years. The Nielsen ratings for the race were 9.6/23, which translated into roughly 16 million viewers.\nDortmund was the first out of the gate, followed closely by Firing Line and then American Pharoah. In the early stages of the Kentucky Derby, Dortmund and Firing Line traded the lead several times. Carpe Diem and American Pharoah were also at the front of the pack, just behind the leaders. Dortmund took the inside position and held it throughout the race. As the horses came around the final turn, it was a three-horse race. Dortmund held the lead on the inside, but Firing Line, running more toward the middle of the track, passed him. American Pharoah, ridden by Victor Espinoza, took the final turn very wide but had the lead by a head in the homestretch. From there, he increased his lead, winning with a time of 2:03.02. Firing Line finished second, one length back; Dortmund took third, three lengths off the lead. Frosted and Danzig Moon rounded out the top five.\nIt was second straight Derby win for Espinoza, who rode California Chrome to victory in 2014, and his third overall. \"I feel like the luckiest Mexican on Earth\", he declared after the race. For trainer Bob Baffert, it was his fourth Derby victory and his first since 2002. Espinoza and Baffert had teamed up to win the 2002 Kentucky Derby with War Emblem. For owner Ahmed Zayat, it was his first Derby victory and the end of a streak of losses. His horses had placed second in three of the previous six Kentucky Derbies, including 2009 when American Pharoah's sire, Pioneerof The Nile, finished second. Additionally, Zayat's 2010 entry, Eskendereya, was the morning line favorite but had to scratch with a career-ending leg injury. \"I'm speechless\", Zayat said. \"No more seconds ... This is one special horse ... This is a dream come true.\" Zayat collected $1.4 million for the win out of the $2.2 million total purse. American Pharoah became the first two-year-old champion to win the Derby since Street Sense in 2007.\nResults.\nTrack – Fast\nTimes: mile – 23.24; mile – 47.34; mile – 1:11.29; mile – 1:36.45; final – 2:03.02.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23.24) (24.10) (23.95) (25.16) (26.57)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nThe Kentucky Derby Payout Schedule\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nSeveral horses from the Derby went on to later wins at the Grade I level.

        "title": "2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier",
        "text": "The 2018 ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier was a cricket tournament that took place during March 2018 in Zimbabwe. It formed the final part of the Cricket World Cup qualification process for the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales. The top two teams, Afghanistan national cricket team and the West Indies, qualified for the World Cup, joining the hosts and the seven teams who had already qualified through their ranking in the ICC ODI Championship. Afghanistan won the tournament, beating the West Indies by 7 wickets in the final. Afghanistan’s Mohommad Shahzad was named the player of the match and Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza was named the player of the tournament.\nThe tournament was initially scheduled to take place in Bangladesh, but in May 2017 it was reported that the event would instead be hosted elsewhere as Bangladesh were close to automatic qualification, and thus would not need to participate in this tournament. Three bids were under consideration: one from Zimbabwe, one from Nepal and a joint-bid from Ireland and Scotland, who were the winners of the previous qualifier tournament.\nIn October 2017, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that Zimbabwe would host the event. In January 2018, the ICC confirmed all the fixtures and venues for the tournament. At the end of the tournament, the Netherlands (who won the ICC World Cricket League Championship) and the top three Associate Member teams earned One Day International (ODI) status until 2023.\nSummary.\nHosts Zimbabwe failed to reach the final and missed out on playing in the Cricket World Cup for the first time since 1983. As a result of their poor performance, Zimbabwe Cricket sacked all their coaching staff and their team captain, Graeme Cremer. Recently appointed Full Member side Ireland also missed the Cricket World Cup for the first time since 2007, and for the first time, no Associate Member qualified for the Cricket World Cup.\nFollowing the conclusion of the group stage, Afghanistan, Ireland, Scotland, United Arab Emirates, West Indies and Zimbabwe had all progressed to the Super Sixes, with a chance to qualify for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Hong Kong, Nepal, Netherlands and Papua New Guinea did not qualify for the Super Sixes, but advanced to the playoffs to determine their final rankings in positions seven to ten. Both Scotland and the United Arab Emirates kept their ODI status until 2022, by virtue of reaching the Super Sixes.\nHong Kong, Nepal and Papua New Guinea competed for the final ODI status spot in the playoffs. In the first round of playoff matches, Nepal beat Papua New Guinea by 6 wickets and the Netherlands beat Hong Kong by 44 runs. Therefore, with the Netherlands already guaranteed ODI status at the end of the tournament, Nepal gained ODI status for the first time. With their defeats in the first playoff matches, Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea both lost their ODI status and were relegated to Division Two of the World Cricket League. The fixture between Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea, for the ninth place playoff, was the 4,000th ODI match to be played.\nThe West Indies became the first side to qualify for the 2019 Cricket World Cup, after they beat Scotland by five runs by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method in the Super Sixes. Tournament hosts Zimbabwe lost their final match in the Super Sixes to the United Arab Emirates, meaning they would need Afghanistan and Ireland's match to end as tie to allow them to progress to the Cricket World Cup. However, Afghanistan beat Ireland by five wickets in the final Super Six match, therefore joining the West Indies in the tournament final and also qualifying for the Cricket World Cup.\nIn the final, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan became the fastest and youngest bowler to take 100 wickets in ODIs when he dismissed Shai Hope. He took 44 matches to take his 100th dismissal, breaking the previous record of 52 matches, set by Mitchell Starc of Australia.\nTeams.\nIt was decided before the 2015 Cricket World Cup that the number of participating teams at the 2019 Cricket World Cup would be reduced to ten. A new World Cup qualification structure was introduced where the host nation of the World Cup and the top seven other teams in the ICC ODI Championship on 30 September 2017 would qualify directly for the World Cup, with the remaining two spots being decided by the World Cup qualifying tournament. Following recent success, Afghanistan and Ireland were promoted into the ICC ODI Championship in 2015, taking the number of teams in the ICC ODI Championship to twelve. Afghanistan and Ireland were granted Test status in 2017, making them the 11th and 12th Test-playing nations, meaning that at least two Test-playing nations would miss the World Cup for the first time.\nThe bottom four teams in the ICC ODI Championship ranking would be joined by the top four teams from the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship and the two finalists of the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two for the qualifying tournament. Therefore, at most two associate teams could qualify for the World Cup, or none if beaten by the Test playing nations.\nICC ODI Championship.\nThe bottom four teams (9th to 12th places) in the ICC ODI Championship, as at 30 September 2017, did not receive automatic World Cup qualification and are required to play in the 2018 World Cup Qualifier. Qualification by this route was finalised after the West Indies lost the first match of their ODI series against England in September 2017, meaning they were unable to catch any of the teams above them in the rankings by the cut-off date. Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe, below the West Indies in the rankings, were confirmed as having to play in the qualification tournament before this date.\nWCL Championship.\nThe top four teams from the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualified for the 2018 World Cup Qualifier. After the conclusion of the sixth round of fixtures in the championship, both the Netherlands and Papua New Guinea had qualified. Following the first fixtures in round seven, they were joined by Scotland and Hong Kong. The Netherlands ended up winning the tournament, with Scotland finishing second followed by Hong Kong in third and Papua New Guinea fourth.\nWCL Division Two.\nThe top two teams from the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two qualified for the 2018 World Cup Qualifier. Nepal and the United Arab Emirates placed first and second in the round-robin stage, thus claiming the final places in the Qualifier. The United Arab Emirates won the final of the Division Two tournament to go into Group A, with Nepal placed in Group B.\nTournament format.\nInitially, the teams were split into two groups of five; these groups played on a round-robin basis. Two points were awarded for a win, one point for a no result and no points for a loss. The top three teams in each group went forward to a Super Six round. The results between the progressing teams were carried forward, including the corresponding points and net run rate, while the results against the teams that finished in the bottom two places in each group were discarded. Each team then played the qualifiers from the other group. The remaining four teams (that finish in the bottom two places in each group) played-off for positions 7–10. The bottom two Associate Member teams, excluding the Netherlands, were relegated to the ICC World Cricket League Division Two.\nThe top two teams at the end of the Super Six stage earned qualification to the 2019 World Cup, and also contested the final to determine the winner of the tournament. If the final ended as a tie, then a Super Over would have been played to decide the winner. In the event of a no result, the tournament's winner would have been the side that finished highest in the Super Sixes.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named ahead of the tournament:\nPrior to the tournament, Stephan Myburgh was ruled out of the Netherlands squad due to injury and was replaced by Bas de Leede. Zimbabwe initially named Ryan Burl and Tarisai Musakanda in their squad, but they were replaced by Sean Williams and Cephas Zhuwao.\nAfghanistan's captain Asghar Stanikzai missed the start of the tournament, after having his appendix removed. Rashid Khan captained Afghanistan in Stanikzai's absence. Stanikzai was eventually ruled out of the start of the tournament and was replaced by Afsar Zazai. Stanikzai returned to the squad, after he was declared fit to play, ahead of Afghanistan's final two Super Six matches. Stanikzai's replacement, Afsar Zazai, was ruled out of the last two matches due to injury. Following Afghanistan's match with Zimbabwe, Mohammad Shahzad was suspended for the final two group matches after being found guilty of damaging part of the ground.\nZimbabwe's Brian Vitori was suspended from bowling, following the match with Nepal. He was replaced by Richard Ngarava. Sheldon Cottrell was replaced in the West Indies squad by Keemo Paul, after Cottrell injured himself during the match against the United Arab Emirates. Ahead of Hong Kong's group match with Scotland, Ahsan Abbasi suffered an injury and was ruled out of the tournament. He was replaced by Kinchit Shah.\nWarm-up matches.\nTen non-ODI warm-up matches were played on 27 February and 1 March.\nGroup stage.\nThe ICC confirmed the fixtures for the tournament in January 2018. All the matches were recorded as ODIs, except those that involved the Netherlands and Nepal, as they did not have ODI status at the start of the tournament. On 8 March 2018, the venues for the final two games in Group B were switched, due to the anticipated attendance for Zimbabwe's last group match. On 13 March 2018, the ICC confirmed all the umpires for the Super Sixes and playoff matches.\nSuper Sixes.\nTeams that advance to the Super Six play three further matches against the qualifiers from the other group, with the two results against teams from their own group carrying forward from the group stage. Teams also carried forward their seeding positions from the first stage to determine the fixtures for the Super Six.\nFinal standings.\nThese were the final standings at the end of the tournament:"

The golf course, designed and built by noted golf course architect Perry Maxwell, hosted the 1952–1954 Ardmore Open as well as the 1954 LPGA Ardmore Open.\nHistory of Dornick Hills.\nThe Dornick Hills Golf Course was named from the Gaelic word \"Dornick\" meaning \"small rocks\". Thousands of these rocks had to be removed before the course could be built. There are still several outcroppings of the natural rock formations on the golf course, including the cliff at the signature \"Cliff Hole\". Course architect Perry Maxwell is buried in the family cemetery on the ridge north of the 7th fairway.\nMaxwell is credited with many of the great layouts in Oklahoma and throughout the United States. In 1913, on the site of a former dairy farm that he owned, Maxwell built the first nine holes of Dornick Hills. The remaining nine holes would not be completed until 1923. Maxwell was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. He came to be known as the \"father of Oklahoma golf\". Dornick Hills enjoys two distinctions, one being that it was Oklahoma's first golf course with Bermuda grass greens. It was also the first Oklahoma golf club to be affiliated with the United States Golf Association (USGA), which occurred on July 20, 1914. For the next six years no other Oklahoma golf club had a USGA affiliation.\nSignature hole at Dornick Hills.\nMaxwell built a green atop a 50-foot cliff on the 16th hole, a signature hole known as the \"Cliff Hole\", at Dornick Hills to make a demanding approach shot on the par 5 hole. Long hitters can risk a wood or long iron shot to the elevated green but most players have no choice but to lay up below the cliff for a short iron approach to the green. On the next hole, golfers tee off from the cliff summit and play sharply downward to a par 3 green below."

        "text": "The 2015–16 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles, during the 2015–16 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. They finished the season with a 15–17 record, the fourth time the program finished with a losing record since 1948, when John Wooden became their coach. The Bruins were led by third-year head coach Steve Alford and played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members in the Pac-12 Conference. Isaac Hamilton earned second-team All-Pac-12 honors, the only Bruin named to the all-conference team.\nWith Kevon Looney having moved on to the National Basketball Association (NBA), sophomore Thomas Welsh was promoted to UCLA's starting lineup at center, while center Tony Parker moved to forward. Freshman guard Aaron Holiday also opened the season as a starter, teaming with Hamilton and Bryce Alford to form a three-guard lineup. The Bruins lost their season opener to Monmouth and lost consecutive games in the Maui Invitational to Kansas and Wake Forest. However, they recovered to upset then-No. 1 Kentucky 87–77 at home and defeated then-No. 20 Gonzaga 71–66 on the road. UCLA finished their non-conference schedule winning six of their last seven games, and entered Pac-12 play at 9–4 and ranked No. 25 in the nation. They were comparatively better than a year earlier, when they entered conference play with five losses and a three-game losing streak.\nThe Bruins had an early conference win against then-No. 7 Arizona, but they were 4–5 halfway through the Pac-12 schedule, including 0–4 against the three teams with the quickest pace in the conference, Washington, USC, and Oregon. Their defense was weakened without comparable replacements for Looney and Norman Powell, a senior from the prior season, and sophomore György Golomán had been out for much of the season with a stress fracture in his leg. UCLA coach Steve Alford believed his big front court was \"slow\" and had sophomore Jonah Bolden start in place of the senior Parker. While Bolden was taller than Parker, he was also lighter. UCLA began their second half with a loss to USC, who swept the Bruins for the first time since 2010. The Bruins lost both games in their crosstown rivalry by double digits for the first time since 1938. In their next game, UCLA blew a 10-point halftime lead to Arizona en route to their fifth loss in seven games. The loss dropped them out of all major NCAA tournament projections and mired in 10th place in the Pac-12. The Bruins were eliminated from the Pac-12 tournament after a 95–71 loss to USC, losing three consecutive times in the same season to the Trojans for the first time in 74 years. UCLA missed the NCAA Tournament for just the third time in 10 years.\nPrevious season.\nThe Bruins finished in fourth place (11–7) in the Pac-12 conference. They earned a No. 11 seed in the NCAA Championship tournament, and advanced to the Sweet 16, becoming the lowest-seed UCLA team to ever reach the regional semifinals. They defeated SMU 60–59 in the second round and UAB 92–75 in the third round. Then the Bruins lost to Gonzaga for the second time of the season, 74-62 in the Sweet Sixteen. The program produced its 49th 20-win season. Norman Powell led the team in scoring with 16.4 points per game, followed by Bryce Alford with 15.4 points per game.\nSchedule.\nUCLA's 2015–16 schedule includes home games against Kentucky, Long Beach State, Pepperdine, Cal Poly, Louisiana-Lafayette, Monmouth, Cal State Northridge, and McNeese State. UCLA will travel to play at Gonzaga and face off against North Carolina at a neutral venue. The Bruins will also make a trip to play three of the following in the Maui Invitational: Kansas, Indiana, St. John's, UNLV, Vanderbilt, and Wake Forest.\nDuring the Pac-12 Conference schedule, UCLA will play 18 games (9 home and 9 away) and will have home-and-homes with the following teams: Arizona, Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon State, USC, Washington, and Washington State. The Bruins will only play the Rocky Mountain teams (Colorado and Utah) at home. UCLA will also only play the Bay area teams (California and Stanford) on the road.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 Tournament"

It is regularly used for international field hockey fixtures by both the Great Britain men's and women's field hockey teams. It hosted the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup. Owned and managed by Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, the site was previously known as Eton Manor and was a wheelchair tennis venue for the 2012 Summer Paralympics before being converted for public use and reopening in June 2014.\nHistory.\nEton Manor.\nThe site was originally known as Eton Manor, the name taken from Eton College, which from the 1880s had run a \"mission\" to raise living standards in the East End of London. In 1909, four Old Etonian philanthropists founded Eton Manor Boys' Club to provide sporting facilities in the Hackney area, purchasing the former Manor Farm in 1913. In 1920, an old rubbish tip site was converted into the club's new sports ground, known as The Wilderness. Facilities included nine football pitches, two rugby pitches, cricket pitches, six tennis courts, a bowling green, a squash court and a running track. Eton Manor Boys' Club closed in 1967 and the club ground fell into disuse in 2001 before being selected for use during the 2012 Olympic Games. The charitable trust set up in 1924 to run and support Eton Manor Boys' Club still continues with different aims and a new name, Villiers Park Educational Trust.\nFour sports clubs originating from Eton's \"mission\" are still in existence:\nEton College has a second connection to the 2012 Olympic Games, as the rowing events were held at the college's private facility, Dorney Lake.\nLondon 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\nDuring the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Eton Manor was the only purpose-built Paralympic venue. It hosted the wheelchair tennis. The venue comprised nine competition courts and four warm-up courts. There were a total of 10,500 seats for spectators, with a 5,000 capacity centre court. The 27-acre site also housed temporary training pools for participants in aquatics events, including three 50m pools for swimmers and smaller pools for synchronised swimmers and water polo competitors.\nBefore the Games, Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy was commissioned to write a poem about Eton Manor to celebrate its history and legacy. The poem is inscribed on a brass plaque at the entrance to the venue and was part of the Winning Words initiative, a national poetry scheme inspired by London 2012 which integrated permanent and temporary poetry on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\nPost-Olympics.\nAfter the Olympic Games, Eton Manor housed the scaled down Olympic Hockey Centre which was relocated from Riverside Arena. The venue was made public following a £30 million conversion and was renamed Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre. Run by the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, it has two hockey pitches and ten tennis courts four indoor and six outdoor. The venue offers a range of events and programmes from grassroots to elite level.\nIn December 2012, the International Tennis Federation announced that the venue would stage the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters, an annual event, on its indoor courts.\nInternational field hockey.\nSince 2014, Lee Valley has staged a number of major international events, most notably the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup, which was the 14th edition of the tournament. It also hosted the 2016 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy and the 2016 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy. From 2019, it has been the home venue of both the Great Britain women's and men's field hockey teams for their home matches in the Women's FIH Pro League and Men's FIH Pro League, most recently in May and June 2022 for the 2021–22 Women's FIH Pro League and the 2021–22 Men's FIH Pro League. The women's team played its first Pro League match at Lee Valley against the United States on 27 April 2019. For major hockey events, the stadium capacity is increased from the default 3,000 to 15,000 all seated."

A 10-year-old named Nicholas (son of referee John Cone) became the youngest champion in WWE history when he teamed with Braun Strowman to defeat Cesaro and Sheamus for the Raw Tag Team Championship. It was also the first time that the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended at a WrestleMania. \nThe US Championship was contested in a fatal-four-way match featuring Randy Orton as the champion, Bobby Roode as the previous champion, Rusev accompanied by Aiden English, and Jinder Mahal accompanied by Sunil Singh. Jinder came out on top via pinning Rusev after what some believe was the best Khallas ever (yet others still consider Sami Zayn's one to be the best).\nWrestleMania 34 received mixed to positive reviews from fans and critics, with the world title matches being subjected to more negative responses. The main event between Lesnar and Reigns particularly received heavy criticism and was decried by some as one of the worst main events in WrestleMania history. Despite this, other aspects of the show, such as the return of Daniel Bryan, the Intercontinental Championship and SmackDown Women's Championship matches, and the debut performance of Ronda Rousey, were widely praised.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". WrestleMania is ranked the sixth most valuable sports brand in the world by Forbes, and has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania.\nAnnounced on January 9, 2017, WrestleMania 34 was scheduled to be held on April 8, 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event was the second WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana and the second held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, which previously hosted WrestleMania XXX in 2014. On October 30, 2017, traveling packages for the event were sold; tickets went on sale on November 17, 2017, with individual tickets costing from $35 to $2,000.\nThe four official theme songs for the event were \"Celebrate\", \"New Orleans\" (both by Kid Rock), \"Let the Good Times Roll\" (by Freddie King) and Devil by Shinedown. On April 8, prior to the start of WrestleMania, WWE and Snickers held the WrestleMania Block Party at the Champions Square plaza. The tailgate event included appearances from Alundra Blayze and Ric Flair as well from active competitors Tamina and R-Truth.\nAmerican duo Chloe x Halle performed \"America the Beautiful\" to kick off the main card of WrestleMania.\nSince 2014, WWE attempted to establish Roman Reigns as their top babyface and the next \"face of the company\", but a significant portion of fans rejected Reigns in this role, taking issue with his perceived special treatment, real-life demeanor, wrestling moveset, speaking skills, and character presentation. This resulted in Reigns being booed while he wrestled in the main events of WrestleMania 31, WrestleMania 32, and WrestleMania 33. The perception that Reigns was the \"company's chosen one\" led to widespread expectations that Reigns would triumph in the main event of WrestleMania 34 to become WWE Universal Champion; and it was also anticipated that while doing so, he would be again received negatively by the WrestleMania crowd.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 14 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, \nwhile storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nWorld championship matches.\nAfter Brock Lesnar won the Universal Championship at WrestleMania 33, he seldom defended the title, which was often criticized, especially by Roman Reigns. As the 2018 men's Royal Rumble winner chose SmackDown's world championship, Lesnar's WrestleMania 34 opponent was determined through the Elimination Chamber match, which was won by Reigns. The two had also previously fought at WrestleMania 31 in March 2015 over Lesnar's WWE World Heavyweight Championship (now WWE Championship), but without a decisive winner as Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Reigns. Despite being advertised, Lesnar did not appear for several episodes of \"Raw\". Reigns repeatedly criticized Lesnar and also questioned WWE Chairman/CEO Vince McMahon, for which he was temporarily suspended. When Reigns nevertheless appeared on \"Raw\" to confront Lesnar, he was arrested by U.S. Marshals. The handcuffed Reigns assaulted the Marshals, but was then attacked by Lesnar. Heyman then declared that should Lesnar lose, they would not re-sign with WWE. Their match was scheduled as the main event, which would be the first Universal Championship match to main event WrestleMania.\nAt the Royal Rumble, SmackDown's Shinsuke Nakamura won the men's Royal Rumble match, earning a world championship match of his choosing at WrestleMania 34. Nakamura chose SmackDown's WWE Champion AJ Styles. At Fastlane, Styles retained the WWE Championship in a six-pack challenge, thus solidifying the Styles-Nakamura match at WrestleMania. The two expressed respect for each other, but Styles warned Nakamura to not take him lightly this time, bringing up their previous encounter in New Japan Pro-Wrestling in January 2016, where Nakamura had defeated Styles.\nUndercard matches.\nAfter failing to win the Elimination Chamber match, Intercontinental Champion The Miz demanded a WrestleMania challenger. Seth Rollins then came out and defeated Miz, followed by Finn Bálor, who also defeated him. The following week, both Rollins and Bálor confronted Miz, leading to a 2-on-3 handicap match between Rollins and Bálor and The Miz and his Miztourage (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel), in which Rollins pinned Miz. Afterwards, Raw General Manager Kurt Angle scheduled The Miz to defend his championship against Bálor and Rollins in a triple threat match at WrestleMania.\nAt the Royal Rumble, Raw's Asuka won the women's Royal Rumble match. As a result, Asuka earned the right to challenge for a women's championship of her choosing at WrestleMania. On the advice of Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon, Asuka postponed her decision until both women's champions had defended their titles at Elimination Chamber and Fastlane, respectively. Following Charlotte Flair's successful defense at Fastlane, Asuka appeared and challenged her for the SmackDown Women's Championship at WrestleMania. Asuka explained that she chose Flair as she wanted to challenge the best women's champion in WWE, while Flair vowed to end Asuka's undefeated streak.\nAfter Alexa Bliss won her second Raw Women's Championship in August 2017, she formed a friendship with Nia Jax, who also had championship aspirations. Jax failed to earn a title shot at the Royal Rumble and also lost to Asuka at Elimination Chamber in a match that would have added her to Asuka's WrestleMania championship match. After Asuka defeated her in a rematch on \"Raw\", Bliss consoled Jax and said she deserved a title match. When Asuka explained her reasons for challenging Charlotte Flair, Bliss and Mickie James confronted her and called out Jax to wrestle Asuka, but Jax did not appear. Later during Jax's match, Bliss and James, who were unaware of the live microphone, were heard disparaging Jax, who was upset by this. The following week, Bliss issued a fake apology and continued to insult Jax, who chased off the champion. When Bliss complained to Raw General Manager Kurt Angle, he scheduled her to defend the Raw Women's Championship against Jax at WrestleMania.\nAfter defeating The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson), Raw Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus said they had defeated every tag team on Raw and issued an open challenge to any tag team to face them at WrestleMania. On March 12, General Manager Kurt Angle scheduled a tag team battle royal with the winning team receiving a championship match at WrestleMania. Braun Strowman interjected himself into the match without a partner and won. The following week, Angle decided that Strowman would receive a Raw Tag Team Championship match at WrestleMania as long as he found a partner. Strowman said that he did not need a partner, but would have one. He defeated both Cesaro and Sheamus in singles matches, but did not reveal his partner prior to the event.\nAt WrestleMania 31 in March 2015, then-UFC mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey appeared alongside The Rock and embarrassed The Authority (Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon). She made some appearances over the next couple of years and was rumored to compete in the 2018 women's Royal Rumble match, however, Rousey denied that she would be at the event. Rousey eventually appeared at the end of the event, confirming that she had signed full-time with WWE. During the official contract signing at Elimination Chamber, her debut match was confirmed for WrestleMania 34. Raw General Manager Kurt Angle, whom Stephanie (now Raw Commissioner) previously had threatened to fire and whom Triple H had turned on at Survivor Series, then brought up the incident from WrestleMania 31 and warned Rousey that Triple H and Stephanie wanted revenge. Rousey threw Triple H through a table and was slapped by Stephanie before eventually signing her contract. The following night on \"Raw\", Stephanie was forced to apologize. As she was leaving the ring, Triple H attacked Angle. The following week, Stephanie said Rousey could choose any Raw wrestler as her opponent at WrestleMania except the champion; she chose Stephanie. When Triple H objected, Angle pointed out that both Triple H and Stephanie had contracts as wrestlers and scheduled a mixed tag team match pitting Stephanie and Triple H against Rousey and himself. A Q&amp;A session on the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania ended with Stephanie putting Rousey through a table.\nThroughout the summer of 2017, Kevin Owens feuded with SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon; at Hell in a Cell, Kevin Owens defeated Shane in a Hell in a Cell match thanks to the help of his friend-turned-rival, Sami Zayn. Zayn explained that he acted out of disappointment about not getting the expected opportunities at SmackDown and realized that Owens was right all along in his questionable actions. Owens and Zayn continued their feud with Shane, including attacking him at Survivor Series and Shane threatened to fire them if they lost their match at Clash of Champions, while SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan seemingly favored the two by giving them WWE Championship opportunities at the Royal Rumble, when AJ Styles retained his title in a handicap match and again at Fastlane, when Owens and Zayn were among the five challengers. During the latter match, the feud escalated as Shane broke up pinfall attempts by Owens and Zayn. Shane then took an indefinite leave of absence, however before leaving, he scheduled Owens and Zayn to fight each other at WrestleMania 34. Owens and Zayn reacted by attacking Shane. The following week, Daniel Bryan revealed that he was medically cleared to compete again; his last match was in April 2015. Later, Bryan fired Owens and Zayn for their attack on Shane and was attacked himself. In response, Bryan said he regretted favoring them and scheduled a tag team match featuring himself and Shane against Owens and Zayn, with the latter duo being rehired if they won.\nAt Fastlane, Randy Orton won the United States Championship from Bobby Roode. Following the match, Jinder Mahal, who felt that he should have been in the match, attacked both men. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Roode invoked his rematch clause for WrestleMania 34. The following week, Orton was scheduled to defend the United States Championship in a triple threat match against Roode and Mahal at WrestleMania. On the March 27 episode, after the team of Mahal and Rusev defeated the team of Orton and Roode, Rusev demanded to be added to the title match since he pinned Orton. The match was subsequently changed to a fatal four-way.\nThroughout 2017, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) and The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) fought at various events over the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. The original feud ended at Hell in a Cell in October with The Usos victorious. The New Day earned another title shot at Fastlane in March, however, both teams were attacked by The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan), injuring Jey, Kingston, and Woods. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Big E and Jimmy teamed up to exact revenge in a losing effort. On the March 27 episode, New Day lost to The Bludgeon Brothers by disqualification after The Usos attacked the latter. A triple threat tag team match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was then scheduled for WrestleMania 34.\nDetermined to compete at WrestleMania 34, free agent John Cena entered himself into the Royal Rumble match to earn himself a world championship match at WrestleMania, however, Cena made it to the final three and was eliminated. He then qualified for Raw's Elimination Chamber match, hoping to earn a shot at the Universal Championship at WrestleMania, and, using his free agent status, was among the five challengers in the WWE Championship match at SmackDown's Fastlane, but came up short in both attempts. Back on \"Raw\", Cena pondered attending WrestleMania as a fan, but then decided to challenge The Undertaker, whom he had tried to challenge a few weeks prior; Cena stated that it was not WWE executives who were preventing the match, but Undertaker himself. Over the remaining weeks leading up to WrestleMania, Cena received no answer, despite repeatedly antagonizing Undertaker. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, Cena declared he would not take a spot from any full-time wrestler in one of the other matches. He stated he was not mad about not having a match, but was mad at Undertaker for not answering.\nPre-show matches.\nOn January 23, 2018, WWE Cruiserweight Champion Enzo Amore was released from WWE, vacating the title. A separate general manager was then appointed for \"205 Live\", which was previously controlled by the Raw General Manager, to address the situation. On the January 30 episode of \"205 Live\", new general manager Drake Maverick scheduled a 16-man single elimination tournament to crown a new WWE Cruiserweight Champion, culminating with the finals at WrestleMania 34. The tournament took place over the next several weeks, with Cedric Alexander and Mustafa Ali advancing to the finals at WrestleMania's pre show for the vacant title.\nOn the March 12 episode of \"Raw\", a battle royal open to any female performer of any brand was scheduled for WrestleMania 34. The match, originally named in honor of WWE Hall of Famer The Fabulous Moolah, was introduced to serve as a female counterpart to the annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. However, a few days later, the match was renamed \"WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal\" due to backlash from fans and critics regarding Moolah's past treatment of other women. Like the men's match, the winner received a trophy, and both the men's and women's battle royals were scheduled for the Kickoff pre-show. The main storyline going into the women's match was the increasingly strained friendship between Bayley and Sasha Banks. At Elimination Chamber, Banks turned on Bayley in the namesake match. Banks then was the first to note her participation in the battle royal on the March 19 episode of \"Raw\". A week later, Bayley confirmed her participation and was confronted by Banks, resulting in a backstage brawl. On the final \"Raw\" before WrestleMania, Banks saved Bayley from a post-match ambush by Absolution's Sonya Deville and Mandy Rose. Banks expected Bayley to be grateful, but the two instead fought.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the two-hour long WrestleMania 34 Kickoff pre-show, with the second hour shown live on USA Network. During the pre-show, it was shown that John Cena had indeed attended the event as a fan, and cameras followed him as he took his seat in the audience, a few rows back from the ring.\nThe first match on the pre-show was the fifth annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. In the closing moments, \"Woken\" Matt Hardy, Mojo Rawley, and Baron Corbin were the final three competitors. Bray Wyatt, who had previously feuded with Hardy, appeared and surprisingly, Wyatt assisted Hardy in eliminating Rawley and distracted Corbin, As a result, Hardy then eliminated Corbin to win the match and trophy.\nNext, Cedric Alexander faced Mustafa Ali in the tournament final for the vacant WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Ali performed a \"054\" on Alexander, who broke the pinfall attempt by placing his foot on the bottom rope. In the end, Alexander executed a \"Lumbar Check\" on Ali to win the title.\nThe WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal culminated in Sasha Banks and Bayley teaming up to eliminate Natalya and The Riott Squad (Ruby Riott, Sarah Logan, and Liv Morgan). Banks and Bayley then shook hands only for Bayley to quickly eliminate Banks. Thinking she had won the match, Bayley began celebrating, not realizing that Naomi had not actually been eliminated. Naomi then performed a \"Rear View\" on Bayley and eliminated her to win the match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with The Miz defending the Intercontinental Championship against Seth Rollins and Finn Bálor in a triple threat match. In the end, Bálor performed a \"Coup de Gráce\" on Miz, only for Rollins to perform a \"Curb Stomp\" on Bálor on top of Miz. Rollins then performed another \"Curb Stomp\" on Miz to win the title, becoming the 19th Grand Slam Champion in the process.\nNext, Charlotte Flair defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Asuka. After an evenly contested match, Charlotte forced Asuka to submit to the \"Figure-Eight Leglock\" to retain the title and end Asuka's undefeated streak, coincidentally mimicking the end of The Undertaker's streak by Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania XXX, which was also held at the same venue four years prior. After the match, the two embraced. \nAfter that, Randy Orton defended the United States Championship against Bobby Roode, Jinder Mahal (accompanied by Sunil Singh), and Rusev (accompanied by Aiden English) in a fatal four-way match. In the climax, Singh distracted Rusev which allowed Mahal to perform the \"Khallas\" on Rusev to win the title.\nNext, Kurt Angle and Ronda Rousey faced Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in a mixed tag team match, which was Rousey's in-ring debut and Stephanie's first match at WrestleMania and Angle's first since WrestleMania 22. Angle and Triple H started the match, while Stephanie distracted the referee to attack Rousey. Rousey eventually tagged in and faced off with Stephanie. She also faced off against Triple H and at one point in the match had Triple H on her shoulders. Angle performed an \"Angle Slam\" on Triple H for a nearfall, Triple H then executed a \"Pedigree\" on Angle, but Rousey broke up the pin. In the end, Rousey forced Stephanie to submit to an armbar for the win.\nIn the next match, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defended the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston, accompanied by Xavier Woods) and The Bludgeon Brothers (Harper and Rowan) in a triple threat tag team match. In the end, Harper pinned Kingston after an aided superbomb to win the titles.\nJohn Cena had attended the first two matches in the audience until a referee had informed him that The Undertaker had arrived at the arena. Following the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match, Cena made his entrance for an expected match with Undertaker. The lights went out, but instead of The Undertaker, Elias appeared. After a brief confrontation, Cena attacked Elias. As Cena was leaving, the lights went out again and Undertaker's coat and hat (which had been left behind at WrestleMania 33) appeared in the ring and were struck by lightning. The Undertaker then made his entrance to the panicked shock of Cena and the match was made official. Undertaker dominated most of the match and utilized his \"Old School\" and flying clothesline maneuvers. Cena countered a chokeslam attempt into a spin-out powerbomb. As Cena attempted a \"Five-Knuckle Shuffle\", Undertaker sat up and performed a chokeslam followed by a \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to defeat Cena, extending the Undertaker's WrestleMania record to 24–2. This would prove to be Undertaker's final WrestleMania match in front of a live audience, as he retired in 2020.\nNext, Daniel Bryan teamed with Shane McMahon to face Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn with the stipulation that if Owens and Zayn won, they would be rehired to SmackDown. Before the match began, Owens and Zayn attacked Bryan and Shane. Owens powerbombed Bryan onto the ring apron, temporarily taking Bryan out of the match. Shane decided to face Owens and Zayn alone and the match officially started. Owens and Zayn dominated the match until Bryan recovered. Zayn performed a \"Blue Thunder Bomb\" on Shane for a nearfall. Zayn performed a \"Helluva Kick\" on Bryan for a near-fall. Owens tagged in and performed a \"Pop-Up Powerbomb\", but Bryan kicked out again. In the end, Bryan forced Zayn to submit to the \"Yes Lock\" to win the match. Per the match's stipulation, Owens and Zayn remained fired from SmackDown.\nNext, Alexa Bliss (accompanied by Mickie James) defended the Raw Women's Championship against Nia Jax. Jax attacked James before the match began, eliminating James as a distraction. In the end, Jax executed a Samoan drop on Bliss from the second rope to win her first Raw Women's Championship.\nIn the following match, AJ Styles defended the WWE Championship against Royal Rumble winner Shinsuke Nakamura. At the conclusion of the match, Styles performed a \"Phenomenal Forearm\", and Nakamura performed a \"Kinshasa\" to the back of Styles' neck, both for nearfalls. In the end, Styles countered Nakamura's attempt at a \"Kinshasa\" into a \"Styles Clash\" to win the match and retain the title. After the match, the two showed mutual respect for each other. Nakamura kneeled down to present Styles with the WWE Championship, but then attacked him with a low blow and a \"Kinshasa\" on the floor, thus turning heel.\nIn the penultimate match, Cesaro and Sheamus defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Braun Strowman and a partner of his choosing. After all three men were in the ring, Strowman said he waited until then to reveal his partner, which would be a random fan from the live audience. Strowman went out into the crowd and chose 10-year-old Nicholas, son of referee John Cone. Strowman and Nicholas won the titles after Strowman performed a running powerslam on Cesaro. With this win, Nicholas became the youngest WWE champion in history.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. Lesnar performed three german suplexes on Reigns, who performed superman punches and two Spears on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed two F-5s on Reigns with each scoring a nearfall. Frustrated, Lesnar put Reigns through an announce table with an F-5 and performed another one in the ring scoring another nearfall. Lesnar removed his gloves and attacked Reigns with elbow strikes, causing Reigns to bleed profusely from the head and performed a fifth F-5 for a near-fall. Reigns recovered and performed two more Spears on Lesnar for a near-fall. In the end, as Reigns attempted another Spear, Lesnar countered into a sixth F-5 to retain the Universal Championship, and became the fourth heel to win in the main event of Wrestlemania. The match would perhaps end up being more notable due the majority of the crowd signaling their strong disinterest by chanting among other things \"boring\", \"this is awful\" and calling for then-former WWE wrestler CM Punk. Even beach balls were also thrown around the crowd which resulted in cheers and boos.\nReception.\nJack de Menezes, writing for \"The Independent\", stated that WrestleMania 34 \"brought a mix of brilliance, bemusement and disappointment\". The Intercontinental title triple threat was \"brilliant\" and \"frantic\", the WWE Title match was an \"eye-catching affair\" culminating in a \"stunning heel-turn\", \"Rousey made a splash on her in-ring debut\", and \"Daniel Bryan once again captured the imagination of the WWE Universe\". Cena-Undertaker left \"fans stunned, bemused and feeling shortchanged at what had occurred\", while finally the main event was a \"slow-burning match\" which was \"a huge anti-climax\".\nDave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer\" noted that the main event was \"physical as hell\", but the \"crowd seemed to react more to beach balls in the crowd\" and \"didn't even pop for\" Reigns' kick-outs. Meltzer felt that the match was \"done for sympathy for Reigns when it was over to make him a babyface as they concentrated on showing him all beaten up\". For the other matches, Meltzer noted that the women's battle royal \"was rushed through\" and it was not the first of its kind at WrestleMania as promoted, pointing to a previous version in 2009. The Intercontinental title triple threat was \"all action\" which \"felt like three babyfaces\" as the Miz \"didn't work as a heel at all in the match.\" He thought Asuka-Charlotte was \"a great match\" with \"hard hitting and pretty emotional stuff\", while the mixed tag team match was \"excellent\"; he noted that Ronda Rousey \"at no point looked out of her element, she was crisp in just about everything\", and that it was \"one of the better pro wrestling debuts I've ever seen\". Finally, Meltzer noted that the announced attendance of 78,133 \"isn't even close to real although it may be August before the real number is out\".\nJoshua Needelman of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that this event was \"one of the most entertaining WrestleMania's in recent memory\" except for an \"anticlimactic\" and \"remarkably disastrous end\", as the \"New Orleans crowd made it clear the main event was not what they wanted\", which saw them booing Reigns. Meanwhile, the Styles-Nakamura match was \"surprisingly slow and plodding, with the intensity only reaching its expected level toward the end\". Also, the mixed tag match \"exceeded expectations\", while the U.S. title match result drew the ire of fans because \"fan-favorite Rusev\" was pinned. Lastly, Needelman noted that Daniel Bryan, \"perhaps the most popular wrestler of the past decade\", \"had the crowd in the palm of his hands\" during his match.\nWade Keller of \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" described the Lesnar-Reigns main event as a \"disaster\". Keller noted that the \"tired and disinterested crowd\" had booed Reigns and chanted \"CM Punk\", \"Boring\" and \"This is awful!\" As for the other matches, Styles-Nakamura was \"a letdown\" given the expectations, Cena-Undertaker was \"crowd pleasing\", the mixed tag match \"went about as well as anyone could have hoped\", and Asuka failing to \"really showcase her signature spots before losing\" \"almost felt like a downgrade in Vince McMahon's faith in her\".\nTroy L. Smith of \"Cleveland.com\" wrote, \"In my mind, Lesnar-Reigns is one of the four worst WrestleMania main events ever, based on build, execution and immediate aftermath\". After comparing the four aforementioned events, Smith concluded that the WrestleMania 34 main event was indeed the worst due to the \"utter disdain\" it produced, with there never being a more \"disinterested\" crowd for a WrestleMania main event. Smith also rated the main event as the \"worst match of the night\", but in contrast, he felt that the rest of WrestleMania 34 was \"pretty great for most of its seven hours\".\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nIn recent years, WWE has gone out of its way to warn viewers that the post-WrestleMania \"Raw\" crowd are \"non-traditional\" and will \"boo the guys they normally cheer (face)\" and \"cheer the guys they normally boo (heel)\". This announcement was repeated after WrestleMania 34, but critics pointed out that the crowd cheered wrestlers \"regardless of whether they are babyfaces or heels\" and that \"on this night, they cheered everyone that WWE wanted them to cheer with one exception... Roman Reigns.\"\nOn the post-WrestleMania 34 episode of \"Raw\", Commissioner Stephanie McMahon, with her arm in a brace, bragged about her WrestleMania performance, stating she knew that she would bring out the best in Ronda Rousey. Rousey then made her entrance and listened to Stephanie praising her. When the two hugged, Ronda grabbed Stephanie's arm, pulled the brace off, and applied the armbar.\nAlso on \"Raw\", another Universal Championship match between champion Brock Lesnar and challenger Roman Reigns was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble event, this time as a Steel Cage match, with no justification given for the match. Reigns acknowledged that Lesnar had re-signed with WWE instead of going back to the UFC, then said he was not directly told about the rematch and alleged that there was a conspiracy against him. After Reigns concluded that he would eventually beat Lesnar if he kept receiving title matches against him, a returning Samoa Joe appeared. Joe called Reigns a failure and said that after Lesnar defeats him at Greatest Royal Rumble, Joe would be waiting for Reigns at Backlash.\nNew Raw Women's Champion Nia Jax had a tag team match against Alexa Bliss and Mickie James. Nia's partner was NXT call-up Ember Moon. The team won after Moon performed the Eclipse on Bliss for the pin. Also in the women's division, Sasha Banks lost to Absolution's Mandy Rose, when interference by Bayley backfired. A match between Banks and Bayley the following week ended in a no-contest when the two were attacked by The Riott Squad, who were traded to Raw.\nBackstage, Braun Strowman and Nicholas informed Raw General Manager Kurt Angle that they were relinquishing the Raw Tag Team Championship due to Nicholas' schedule as a fourth grader, but vowed to come back for the title when Nicholas was done with school. When Cesaro and Sheamus demanded their titles back, Angle said they could regain them at the Greatest Royal Rumble. A four-team tournament to determine their opponents, called the Tag Team Eliminator, was won by André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal winner \"Woken\" Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt.\nNew Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins was interrupted by Finn Bálor. The Miz then came out and said that he wanted his contractual rematch at Backlash. Jeff Hardy then returned from injury and teamed with Rollins and Bálor in a winning effort against Miz and The Miztourage. The following week, Miz was traded to SmackDown, splitting him from The Miztourage, who remained on Raw and were later renamed to The B-Team.\nKevin Owens and Sami Zayn appeared on \"Raw\", seeking jobs from General Manager Kurt Angle. Angle scheduled a match between the two, with the winner receiving a Raw contract. However, the match ended in a double countout with neither receiving a contract. The following week during the Superstar Shake-up, Commissioner Stephanie McMahon overruled Angle and awarded Owens and Zayn each a Raw contract.\nSmackDown.\nOn the first \"SmackDown\" after WrestleMania, Commissioner Shane McMahon announced that Daniel Bryan – now a full-time wrestler on the SmackDown brand – resigned as General Manager, and introduced Paige, who retired from in-ring competition the previous night on \"Raw\" due to injuries, as Bryan's successor. She then scheduled a match between Daniel Bryan and WWE Champion AJ Styles. Shinsuke Nakamura, who had issued a mocking apology for attacking Styles, attacked both Bryan and Styles during their match. The following week, a rematch between Styles and Nakamura for the championship was scheduled for the Greatest Royal Rumble.\nThe Usos earned a SmackDown Tag Team Championship match against The Bludgeon Brothers at Greatest Royal Rumble by defeating The New Day. Also, Randy Orton defeated Bobby Roode and Rusev in a triple threat match to earn a United States Championship match. Following this, new United States Champion Jinder Mahal was traded to Raw, but lost the title to Jeff Hardy, who moved to SmackDown. The winner of the championship match between Mahal and Hardy at Greatest Royal Rumble would face Orton at Backlash.\nSmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair commented on her WrestleMania match and future challengers, but was interrupted and attacked by NXT's The IIconics (Peyton Royce and Billie Kay). After this, Carmella cashed in her Money in the Bank contract and won the title. Also in the women's division, Natalya confronted Naomi, calling her victory in the WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal a disappointment. Naomi then defeated Natalya in a match.\n205 Live.\nOn \"205 Live\", Cedric Alexander celebrated becoming WWE Cruiserweight Champion, with Mustafa Ali showing his respect. Buddy Murphy then attacked the new champion from behind and performed Murphy's Law on him.\nResults.\nWWE Cruiserweight Championship Tournament.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "Ryan Patrick Day (born March 12, 1979) is an American football coach and former college football player. He is the 24th and current head football coach at Ohio State University, a position he has held since 2019. Day was also the acting head coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes for the first three games of the 2018 season. He attended the University of New Hampshire, where he played quarterback and linebacker for the Wildcats from 1998 to 2001 before he began his coaching career in 2002.\nPlaying career.\nDay attended Manchester Central High School in Manchester, New Hampshire. As a quarterback and defensive back, he was the state's Gatorade Player of the Year for his senior season.\nDay attended the University of New Hampshire. Playing for then-offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, Day set four career records at UNH, including completion percentage and touchdowns.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nDay was the offensive coordinator for Temple in 2012, as well as the offensive coordinator for Boston College from 2013 to 2014. He was hired as the Philadelphia Eagles' quarterbacks coach on January 22, 2015. Then, in 2016, after his mentor Chip Kelly was relieved of his duties in Philadelphia, Day was hired in the same role by Kelly, who became the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. On January 3, 2017, Day was hired to replace co-offensive coordinator Tim Beck of the Ohio State Buckeyes. After being linked to the Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator position in January 2018, Day was promoted to offensive coordinator and primary play caller at Ohio State.\nOhio State.\n2018 season.\nOn August 1, 2018, Day was named acting head coach at Ohio State when head coach Urban Meyer was placed on administrative leave when news came to light of Meyer's knowledge of events surrounding then-fired Zach Smith's domestic violence accusations made by Smith's estranged wife. Day won all three games during Meyer's absence. On December 4, 2018, Ohio State announced that Meyer would retire as head coach after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by Day on a full-time basis.\n2019 season.\nIn 2019, Day's first season as a full-time head coach, he led the Buckeyes to a perfect 12–0 regular season record, the Buckeyes' first undefeated regular season since 2013. Despite being predicted to finish second in the Big Ten East Division according to the 2019 Cleveland.com preseason poll, the Buckeyes clinched the division following their November 23 victory over Penn State, and secured a spot in the Big Ten Championship, which they would go on to win beat Wisconsin 34–21. The Buckeyes were named the number two seed in the College Football Playoff and lost to the Clemson Tigers in the Fiesta Bowl. On December 3, 2019, Coach Day was named the Dave McClain Coach of the Year by the media.\n2020 season.\nDay's second season was significantly shortened due to the Big Ten Conference's policies regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Buckeyes' regular season was shortened from 12 games to 8 games, and then down to 5 because of cancellations due to the pandemic. After starting the season 4–0, Coach Day was forced to miss the December 5 game against Michigan State after testing positive for COVID-19, which the Buckeyes won, 52–12. What would have been Ohio State's sixth regular season game, against rival Michigan, was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns within the Michigan program. This was the first time since the 1917 season that Ohio State and Michigan did not play each other. The Big Ten's coronavirus policies would have prevented the Buckeyes from playing in the 2020 Big Ten Football Championship Game, as they did not meet the six-game threshold put forth by the conference. However, on December 9, 2020, the Big Ten administrative council voted to remove the six game minimum, allowing Ohio State to advance to the conference championship. The Buckeyes played in the Big Ten Championship game on December 19, where they beat the Northwestern Wildcats 22–10. Ohio State was selected as the number 3 seed in the College Football Playoff, where they faced number 2 Clemson in the 2021 Sugar Bowl. Ohio State defeated Clemson 49–28, and advanced to the 2021 College Football Playoff National Championship, to face number 1 Alabama. The Buckeyes lost to Alabama 52–24.\n2021 season.\nThe 2021 season, Day's third full season as head coach, began with the Buckeyes ranked fourth in both the AP and Coaches' Poll. After an early season upset by Oregon, Day led Ohio State through a nine-game win streak behind Heisman finalist C. J. Stroud. Ohio State had wins against then 20th-ranked Penn State and fifth-ranked Michigan State. Going into the Michigan game, Ohio State was ranked No. 2 and Michigan was ranked No. 5 by the College Football Playoff committee. Michigan defeated Ohio State for the first time since 2011. Though technically Ohio State and Michigan tied for the division championship, despite the loss, Michigan earned the right to represent the Big Ten East in the Conference Championship game. As a result, this loss effectively eliminated Ohio State from playoff contention. Ohio State was selected to play against Utah in the Rose Bowl. Ohio State won the Rose Bowl, 48–45.\n2022 season.\nThe 2022 season, which was Day's fourth full season at the helm, featured the Buckeyes starting ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' Poll. With returning quarterback C. J. Stroud, Ohio State managed to start 8–0, with double digit wins at home over a then-top 5 Notre Dame and away at the #13 ranked Penn State Nittany Lions. In the inaugural College Football Playoff rankings of the season, the Buckeyes landed at #2, a spot they would hold for four weeks. Though they struggled in games against a 1–7 Northwestern and a 6–4 Maryland, Ohio State managed to remain undefeated heading into the matchup against #3 Michigan for the series' second matchup of 11–0 teams (the first since 2006), and the third meeting between top-5 teams since they met in 2016. Despite being favored by eight points, Ohio State was utterly embarrassed 45–23, and managed to score only three points in the second half. With this loss, Ohio State failed to reach the Big Ten Championship for the second consecutive season, and Ryan Day fell to 1–2 against the Wolverines, becoming the first Ohio State head coach to lose multiple games to Michigan in the 21st century. Day is also 0–2 since infamously stating that he would \"hang 100 on them.\" Despite the loss to the Wolverines, the Buckeyes made the College Football Playoff as the 4-seed. In the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, Day and Buckeyes fell to the eventual National Champion Georgia Bulldogs 42–41.\n2023 season.\nIn the 2023 season, which was Day's fifth season at the helm, featured the Buckeyes reaching an 11–0 record and being ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the third consecutive year. This time, Michigan won 30–24. It marked the Buckeyes first three-game losing streak to Michigan since 1995–97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14–3 on December 29, 2023, to finish the season with an 11–2 record.\nPersonal life.\nDay met his wife, Christina Ourania Spirou, whom he calls Nina, when they played together on the same tee ball team when she was seven and he was six. Married in June 2005, the Days have three children.\nDay was raised by a single mother, Lisa Day, following the death of his father, Raymond Day, on January 20, 1988, of suicide. On June 5, 2019, Day disclosed publicly, for the first time, his father was a victim of suicide, when he was nine years old, with two younger brothers, Chris, seven, and Tim, five .\nDay is an advocate for mental health awareness. Since becoming head coach at Ohio State, Day and his wife have chosen to partner with an organization focused on lifting stigmas related to mental health called On Our Sleeves, a movement begun at the Nationwide Children's Hospital. An extension of this partnership is The Christina and Ryan Day Fund for Pediatric and Adolescent Mental Wellness, which the Days donated $100,000 to initiate."

        "title": "List of highest individual scores in One Day International cricket",
        "text": "One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams affiliated to the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global governing body of cricket. Men's ODI cricket is played between teams which are Full members of the ICC and the top four Associate and Affiliate members who achieve ODI status temporarily. Since 2018, matches played by Associate and Affiliate members as part of the Asia Cup or the ICC World Cup are also considered as ODIs. In women's cricket matches played between the top 10 ranked teams – as announced by ICC – are given ODI status, as are matches played as a part of the ICC Women's World Cup or ICC Women's Championship. ODIs consist of one innings per team, with a limit to the number of overs. This limit is currently 50 overs, although in the past it has been 55 or 60 overs.\nThe earliest match now recognized as an ODI was played between England and Australia at Melbourne Cricket Ground in January 1971; since then there have been over 4,000 ODIs. In the first ever ODI match John Edrich of England scored the first ever half century. He scored 82 runs which remained the highest individual score for that match. Dennis Amiss of England scored the first ever century in the second ever ODI in the following year. He scored 103 runs against Australia at Old Trafford Cricket Ground on 24 August 1972. The record of highest individual score progressed with Roy Fredericks's 105 and David Lloyd's unbeaten 116. In June 1975, Glenn Turner of New Zealand scored the first ever 150 plus score. He scored an 171 runs against East Africa at Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Birmingham on 7 June 1975. The record was bettered by Kapil Dev of India with an unbeaten 175 runs against Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup. In 1984, Viv Richards of the West Indies further bettered the record with an unbeaten 189 runs against England at Old Trafford.\nUntil December 1997, no player had achieved a score of 200 in ODIs. The highest individual score up to that point was 194 by Saeed Anwar of Pakistan, scored on 21 May 1997 against India at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. On 16 December of the same year, the Australian woman cricketer Belinda Clark broke the 200-run mark. She set the highest individual score; an unbeaten 229 runs against Denmark at the MIG Club Ground, Mumbai. This record remained for almost 17 years until Rohit Sharma of India broke it on 13 November 2014. He scored a 264 runs against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens in Kolkata; this remains the highest individual score, . Clark's score remains the highest achieved by a captain, as well as the highest individual score in the Women's World Cup.\nIn men's cricket, Zimbabwe's Charles Coventry equalled Anwar's record after 12 years. He scored 194 not out against Bangladesh at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, on 16 August 2009. In men's cricket, the first player to score a double century was India's Sachin Tendulkar. He scored 200 not out against South Africa at Captain Roop Singh Stadium, Gwalior, on 24 February 2010. After this in 2011 Virender Sehwag scored highest 219 runs against west indies. At that time Sehwag became the second player to score a double century in Men's One Day Internationals. In women's cricket Amelia Kerr of New Zealand set a new highest individual score in women's ODI when she broke Belinda Clark's 21-year-old record on 13 June 2018, scoring an unbeaten 232 runs against Ireland. Kerr is also the youngest player to score a double century, achieving the feat at the age of 17. New Zealand's Martin Guptill is the highest individual scorer in any ICC tournament with an unbeaten 237 runs against the West Indies at Westpac Stadium, Wellington. in the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Rohit Sharma is the only player with three ODI double centuries having scored 209, 264 and 208*. On 10 December 2022, Ishan Kishan became the fourth Indian batsman to score a double century. He scored 210 runs against Bangladesh in the third ODI in the India vs Bangladesh ODI Series and scored the fastest double century in ODI cricket, scoring 200 off of 126 balls. On 18 January 2023, Shubman Gill became the second youngest player to score a double century. He was 23 years and 123 days old. His score of 208 runs against New Zealand in the first ODI of the 2023 India vs New Zealand ODI Series made him the fifth Indian and eleventh overall to score a double century."

        "text": "The Ice Hockey Queensland, currently trading as Ice Hockey Q is the governing body of ice hockey in Queensland, Australia. The Ice Hockey Queensland is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia.\nHistory.\nQueenslands first ice rink.\nTo build the first ice skating venue for Queensland saw failed attempts and proposals, dating back to 1938, with the proposal of an ice skating rink on Wickham Street, Brisbane. The proposal was submitted by C. V. E. Mitchell for a dual purpose venue that would hold ice skating during the winter season and roller skating during the summer season. A few months later the formation of Brisbane Ice Skating Palais Ltd. was made 5 November 1938 who stated that they expected to open the new rink 1 May 1939. Closer to the proposed opening date for the ice rink, it was announced that the development plans for the proposed new ice skating rink were under reconstruction and details could not be given on 17 February 1939.\nThe first ice skating rink built in Queensland was proposed by Sir Oswald Stoll and built by an English refrigeration engineer, Mr. C. N. Pugh, who arrived on Friday 17 November 1939 along with 4 engineers to construct the rink as part of a traveling show in the His Majesty's Theatre in Brisbane. The show was a production called Switzerland, which had traveled through England and Africa with these same engineers and equipment. This rink was not a public ice skating rink and was only used for the season for the production where champion ice skaters Phil Taylor and Megan Taylor headlined.\nIn 1947, secretary of the Queensland branch of the Pedal Cyclists' Association, Les Cecil proposed a dual purpose venue as a solution which would see cycling in the summer season on a removable floor so that ice skating could be enjoyed when the floor was removed for the winter season.\nIn 1953 a construction engineer named Mr. W. J. Newton was to finish plans for 3 pools to be built on his land opposite the Mount Gravatt showgrounds. The proposal was to include an Olympic swimming pool, Olympic diving pool and a shallow children's pool. To also be built near the pools were 4 tennis courts, mini golf course and an ice skating rink.\nThe first public ice rink in Queensland was Mowbray Park Ice Rink which opened in 1958 and it was here that ice hockey began for Queensland. The rink was built in the former Mowbray Park Picture Palace and lasted 7 seasons until it closed in 1967.\nQueensland Hockey.\nAccording to Ice Hockey Queensland:\nIce Hockey Queensland currently sanctions three national league teams (Brisbane Lightning Women's in the Australian Women’s Ice Hockey League, Brisbane Lightning in the Australian Ice Hockey League, and Brisbane Blitz in the Australian Junior Ice Hockey League) and four clubs (Southern Stars, Brisbane Buccaneers, Gold Coast Grizzlys and Northern Lightning).\nNational Competition.\nGoodall Cup.\nIn 1977, Queensland won their first Goodall Cup and were the first state to win the Goodall Cup other than Victoria and New South Wales since the inaugural inter-state competition in 1909.\nLeagues.\nThe QJIHL (Queensland Junior Ice Hockey League) includes:"

In the game five clincher the Gauchos were up 6-1 before the Bruins rallied back with six straight points to lead 7–6. The two teams kept exchanging kills, with UCLA maintaining a slim lead to take the championship by the margin: 10–15, 15–8, 10–15, 15–11, 15–12. Leonard, Menges and Mike Normand were named to the All-Tournament team. UCLA ended the season 30–5. It was the fourth championship in five years for the Bruins.

Originally, it was announced that three more teams would qualify from the 2017–2020 ICC Women's Championship, but in 2018 this was changed to four teams plus the hosts. It was intended that the remaining three places would be determined through the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, which was postponed from 2020. However, the tournament was cancelled midway through and the remaining places allocated based on ODI rankings.\nAustralia were the first team to qualify for the semi-finals after they won their first five matches of the tournament. South Africa became the second team to reach the semi-finals, winning four out of their first six group matches, and gaining a point for a no result against the West Indies.

In the first match, England beat Bangladesh by 100 runs to secure their place in the knockout phase. In the last match of the group stage, South Africa beat India by three wickets. The result meant that India were eliminated, with the West Indies taking the final spot in the semi-finals.\nAhead of the first semi-final match, both teams were without key players in their squads.

        "title": "Tony Parker (basketball, born 1993)",
        "text": "Virgil Anthony Parker (born September 18, 1993) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins at both the center and power forward positions. He played for the Iowa Wolves of the NBA G League.\nAs a high school player in Georgia, Parker won four consecutive state championships and was named the top player in the state. He also earned national All-American honors. Parker joined UCLA in 2012 as part of the top recruiting class in the nation, and helped the school to three NCAA tournaments, including consecutive Sweet 16 appearances in 2014 and 2015. He became a starter in his junior year and finished his four-year college career ranked No. 6 in UCLA history in career games played. After graduating, he played in the G League before playing in Mexico.\nEarly life.\nParker was born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Virgil and Hazel Parker. His father played college basketball. Growing up, Parker would tag along with his older brother, Adrian, and watch him play basketball at a local court. When Parker was five, his brother was arrested and went to prison for 20 years for armed robbery. While Adrian was away, Parker helped take care of his brother's son, Jayvion.\nBy the seventh grade, Parker stood and weighed , and would be mistaken for a lineman. He attended Miller Grove High School in Lithonia, Georgia, and some doubted whether he could play basketball for them. However, he led their team to four consecutive state titles (2009–2012), the first time a player in Georgia had started for four straight state champions since Dontonio Wingfield (1990–1993). With the help of a personal trainer, his strength and conditioning improved each season. As a senior, Parker averaged 16.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. He was named Mr. Georgia Basketball as the top player in the state, and was recognized nationally as a 'Parade', McDonald's and Jordan Brand All-American.\nAs a senior, he was rated a four-star prospect, ranked No. 20 player in the nation by Scout.com, No. 26 by ESPN.com and No. 27 by Rivals.com. He was rated the No. 6 center in the country by Rivals, No. 7 by ESPN and No. 8 by Scout. Parker chose to play college basketball at UCLA over Kansas, Duke, Ohio State, Memphis, and Georgia.\nCollege career.\nParker joined Shabazz Muhammad, Kyle Anderson and Jordan Adams in a UCLA recruiting class considered the best in the nation. The four all knew each other from competing in Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). Muhammad and Anderson were also McDonald's All-Americans. Parker's former AAU coach with the Atlanta Celtics, Korey McCray, had joined UCLA the previous year as an assistant coach; Adams had played for the Celtics too.\nBothered by injuries and lack of conditioning, the , Parker did not play much as a freshman in 2012–13, averaging 2.4 points and 1.4 rebounds in 6.3 minutes per game. He was the team's only big body with an inside presence after Anthony Stover was dismissed from the team and Joshua Smith transferred mid-season. However, Coach Ben Howland rarely played Parker off the bench, relying instead on twins David and Travis Wear, who were primarily jump shooters as opposed to post players. Parker became so unhappy he considered transferring. He finished the season averaging a Pac-12 Conference-worst 10.4 fouls per 40 minutes, and the Bruins had the worst rebounding margin in the conference.\nDuring the offseason, UCLA replaced Howland with Steve Alford. Parker lost , and began 2013–14 in better shape than in his first year. On January 23, 2014, he scored a then-career-high 22 points on 9 of 14 shooting in a 91–74 win over Stanford. His averages improved in his sophomore year to 6.9 points and 4.4 rebounds. He finally became a starter in 2014–15, boosting his performance to 11.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. He was the final player remaining from the highly touted 2012 recruiting class—the other three had moved on to the National Basketball Association (NBA). Parker showed improvement on offense with his post moves, becoming the team's primary inside threat. He ranked sixth in the Pac-12 in field goal percentage (54.3). He was also more focused on defense, but was still prone to foul trouble. Alford called him the team's most important player. When Parker missed the road trip to the Oregon schools, UCLA went 0–2 and lost by a combined 29 points. He returned against Utah, when the Bruins earned their best win of the season as Parker's inside play balanced their offense that had become overly dependent on their perimeter players. On March 21, 2015, in the 2015 NCAA tournament, Parker scored a career-high 28 points and added 12 rebounds in a 92–75 win over UAB, helping the Bruins advance to the Sweet 16 for the second straight year.\nParker returned as the Bruins' lone senior in 2015–16, but the team did not advance to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in his career. With Kevon Looney having left for the NBA, Parker was moved to forward and Thomas Welsh entered the starting lineup at center. Parker was named to the initial watch list of twenty candidates for the Karl Malone Award, given annually to the top power forward in Division I men's basketball. In the season opener, he scored 19 points and established career highs of 19 rebounds, nine offensive rebounds, and four assists in an 84–81 loss to Monmouth. He became the first Bruin to have double-doubles in the first three games of a season since Bill Walton recorded nine consecutive to start 1973–74. The Bruins began the season 9–4 with Parker logging seven double-doubles in those 13 games. However, he had just two double-doubles in the final 19 games, when UCLA lost 13 times to finish with a 15–17 record. After the Bruins struggled on defense while starting 3–5 in their conference schedule, Alford believed their big front court was \"slow\" and had Jonah Bolden start against Washington State in place of Parker, who was averaging 13.5 points and 9.6 rebounds as a starter. While Bolden was taller than Parker, he was also lighter. The switch helped UCLA win 83–50 for their largest margin of victory of the season; Parker scored 11 points in 18 minutes, which was 10 minutes below his average. After five games as a reserve, Parker returned to the starting lineup in place of Welsh, who had presented the coaches with the idea. The Bruins played their best game in weeks, winning 77–53 over Colorado, but they lost their final five games of the season. Parker finished the season with averages of 12.6 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 25.1 minutes per game. He ranked eighth in the Pac-12 in rebounding, first in offensive rebounds per game (3.3), and ninth in field goal percentage (53.9). He ended his four-year career having played 136 games, which ranked sixth in UCLA history.\nProfessional career.\nParker worked out for the Los Angeles Clippers prior to the 2016 NBA draft. However, most mock drafts did not list him, and he went undrafted. He sat out the 2016–17 season with an injury.\nIn 2017, Parker participated in the NBA G League's annual Player Invitational to earn a spot in the league's upcoming draft. He was drafted in the second round of the 2017 draft with the 27th overall pick by the Iowa Wolves. He played seven games and averaged 3.1 points and 2.6 rebounds before being waived on December 27. He later played in Mexico with Frayles de Guasave of the CIBACOPA for the 2018 season, and joined Aguacateros de Michoacán in the LNBP for 2018–19."

        "text": " American expatriate baseball players in Japan have been a feature of the Japanese professional leagues since 1934. American expatriate players began to steadily find spots on Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) rosters in the 1960s. More than 600 Americans have played NPB, although very few last more than a single season in Japan.\nMany of the most celebrated American expatriate players came to Japan after not finding success in the Major Leagues. Major League Baseball (MLB) players, scouts, and sabermetricians describe play in the NPB as \"AAAA\"; less competitive than in MLB, but more competitive than in AAA minor league baseball, which may explain the American expatriate players' success overseas. (see: \"Big in Japan\")\nAmerican players hold several NPB records, including highest career batting average (Leron Lee, .334), highest single season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #3 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #5 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153).\nSince the 1970s, Americans have also made an impact in Nippon Professional Baseball's managing and coaching ranks, with Bobby Valentine and Trey Hillman managing their respective teams to Japan Series championships.\nGaijin waku and cultural differences.\nFor most of its history, NPB regulations imposed \"gaijin waku\", a limit on the number of non-Japanese people per team to two or three — including the manager and/or coaching staff. Initially each team was allowed three foreign players; in 1963 this was reduced to two. With enough service time, a non-Japanese player like Randy Messenger no longer counts against this limitation (with Messenger achieving that after nine seasons with the Hanshin Tigers).\nIn addition to the foreign culture, the language barrier, and loneliness, differences in the way the game is played in Japan are often challenges for American players. Japanese teams practice much more often than American teams, the game relies more on off-speed pitching and not as many fastballs, and team harmony is stressed over individual achievements. The American writer Robert Whiting wrote in his 1977 book \"The Chrysanthemum and the Bat\" that,\nWhile others have objected to characterizing the sport that way, many Japanese players and managers describe themselves in these terms.\nPerhaps because of these cultural differences, many expatriate baseball players don't last very long in NPB. Even star players often return home after five or six seasons. Of American expatriate baseball players in Japan, the longest tenures in NPB belong to Tuffy Rhodes (a total of 13 seasons in NPB), Wally Yonamine (12 seasons), Leron Lee (11 seasons), and Leon Lee, Greg Wells, and Randy Messenger (10 seasons each).\nRecruitment and salaries.\nThere was time when Japanese teams looked to recruit established Major League players on the downside of their careers. Now, however, Japanese teams scout American Triple-A games and monitor MLB transactions, looking for players being shuttled back and forth between the minors and the majors. A good majority of American players recruited to play in NPB are power hitters, which traditionally are in short supply in Japan.\nAlthough the average NPB salary is not comparable to MLB salaries, Japanese teams can offer much more money than a player can make in the American minor leagues. The typical American playing NPB has a higher base salary than his Japanese teammates, but his endorsement opportunities are much more limited. The Yomiuri Giants are particularly known for the high salaries they pay foreign players.\nHistory.\n1930s and 1940s.\nAmerican Major League Baseball outfielder Lefty O'Doul was instrumental in spreading baseball's popularity in Japan, serving as the sport's \"goodwill ambassador\" in the mid-1930s, and again after World War II.\nJapanese-American outfielder Fumito \"Jimmy\" Horio (who hailed from Hawaii) became the first American to play professional baseball in Japan when he joined the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (later known as the Tokyo Giants) in December 1934, touring with them in 1935. Dai Nippon was a team of all-stars organized by media mogul Matsutarō Shōriki that matched up against a visiting American All-Star team that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer. Owner Shōriki survived an assassination attempt by right-wing nationalists for allowing foreigners (in this case, Americans) to play baseball in Jingu Stadium. He received a 16-inch-long scar from a broadsword during the assassination attempt.\nHarris McGalliard (known in Japan as \"Bucky Harris\"), Herbert \"Buster\" North, and James E. \"Jimmy Bonna\" Bonner became the first Americans to play in Japan's professional baseball league, when the Japanese Baseball League was formed in 1936. (Bonner was African-American, thus beating Jackie Robinson to professional baseball 11 years before Robinson broke in with the Brooklyn Dodgers.) \"Bucky Harris\" was the fall 1937 Japanese Baseball League Most Valuable Player, with a .310 batting average.\nHarris, North, and Bonner were joined by the Japanese-American players Kiyomi \"Slim\" Hirakawa, Kazuyoshi \"George\" Matsuura, Yoshio \"Sam\" Takahashi, and Tadashi Wakabayashi.\nIn October 1940, responding to rising hostility toward the West due to World War II, the league outlawed the use of English in Japanese baseball. Pitcher Tadashi Wakabayashi renounced his American citizenship in 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (so his achievements as the Japanese Baseball League Most Valuable Player in 1944 and 1947 \"don't count\" toward the accomplishments of American players). No Americans played in Japanese pro leagues from that point until after the war.\n1950s.\nAnother Hawaiian, Wally Yonamine, was the first American to play professional baseball in Japan after World War II when he joined the Yomiuri Giants of the reorganized Japanese professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball. A multi-skilled outfielder, Yonamine was a member of four Japan Series Championship teams, the Central League Most Valuable Player in 1957, a consecutive seven-time Best Nine Award winner (1952–58), an eleven-time All-Star, and a three-time batting champion. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 1994, the only American yet admitted into the Hall as a player until Randy Bass was inducted in 2023.\nOther than Yonamine, the first Americans to play NPB were African-American veterans of Negro league baseball. The Hankyu Braves made a commitment to attracting these players, the first of whom were third-baseman John Britton and pitcher Jimmy Newberry, who both came to the Braves in 1952. Britton played for the Braves through the 1953 season, while Newberry left after one year. Infielder Larry Raines and pitcher Rufus Gaines joined Britton on the Braves in 1953. Gaines pitched well, recording 14 wins with a 2.53 ERA, but left after one season, while Raines stayed another year, winning the Pacific League batting title in 1954 with a .337 average.\nIn 1953, while serving in the military, former Boston Braves pitcher Phil Paine pitched in nine games for the Nishitetsu Lions, becoming the first former major leaguer to play in Nippon Professional Baseball. His first appearance occurred on August 23, 1953.\nIn 1954, the Mainichi Orions signed catcher Charlie Lewis and the Takahashi Unions signed catcher Sal Recca. Both men stayed in Japan for two seasons, with Lewis being a Best Nine Award-winner both years, and Recca slugging 33 home runs during his two NPB seasons.\nOutfielder/first-baseman Jack Ladra joined the Toei Flyers in 1958. He became the first American (other than Yonamine) who seemed to really find a home in Japan, staying with the team until 1964.\nThe Kintetsu Buffalo signed former pitcher Glenn Mickens and catcher Ron Bottler for the 1959 season. Mickens played for five years in Japan, compiling a record of 45–53 with a 2.54 ERA. Bottler played for the Buffalo for three seasons, gradually converting from catcher to starting pitcher, where he had more success.\n1960s.\nIn 1962, the Chunichi Dragons signed former Major League stars Don Newcombe and Larry Doby. Newcombe had been a pitcher in the Major Leagues, but played for the Dragons almost exclusively as an outfielder/first-baseman, hitting .262 with 12 home runs and 43 RBI; while Doby compiled modest numbers of a .225 batting average, 10 home runs, and 35 RBI. Newcombe and Doby each only played one NPB season before returning home to the U.S.\nIn 1964, Nankai Hawks ace Joe Stanka won 26 games to receive the Pacific League MVP award — the first American to win such an award. He pitched shutouts in Games 1, 6, and 7 of the 1964 Japan Series to win the Japan Series MVP award as well. That same year, fellow American pitcher Gene Bacque of the Hanshin Tigers compiled a 29-9 record with a 1.89 ERA, becoming the first non-Japanese player to receive the Eiji Sawamura Award. Bacque won Game 2 of the Japan Series that year, but lost Game 6 to Stanka 1-0.\nFormer Chicago Cubs major league ballplayer George Altman played professional baseball in Japan from 1968 through 1975, for the Lotte Orions and the Hanshin Tigers, where he had a .309 batting average with 205 home runs.\n1970s.\nIn 1971 former Los Angeles Dodgers player Johnny Werhas played for the Taiyo Whales. In the first trade between a Japanese team and an American team, he was dealt to the San Diego Padres' Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders, for longtime Major League infielder Clete Boyer. Boyer played professionally in Japan for the Taiyō Whales from to . His roommate was Sadaharu Oh. After retiring in 1975, Boyer became the defensive coach for the Taiyō Whales in 1976.\nIn 1972 the Hiroshima Toyo Carp became the last team to hire their first non-Japanese player (excluding Japanese-Americans), when former American League MVP Zoilo Versalles joined the team.\nFormer league star Wally Yonamine became the first foreigner to be a manager in the NPB, when he took charge of the Chunichi Dragons from 1972 to 1977.\nAfter a long successful Major League career, Joe Pepitone made an impression in a negative way. In 1973 he accepted an offer of $70,000 ($ today) a year to play for the Yakult Atoms. While in Japan, he hit .163 with one home run and two RBIs in 14 games played. Pepitone spent his days in Japan skipping games for claimed injuries only to be at night in discos, behavior which led the Japanese to adopt his name into their vernacular—as a word meaning \"goof off.\"\nIn 1974, Clarence Jones of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes hit 38 home runs, becoming the first foreign player to win a home run title in Nippon Professional Baseball. He led the Pacific League again with 36 home runs in 1976.\nIn 1975, Joe Lutz became the first Caucasian to manage a team in Japanese professional baseball. After being hired by the Hiroshima Carp in 1974 as a batting instructor, the following season, Lutz was selected to manage the Carp. Hall of Fame pitcher Warren Spahn was hired to serve as the team's temporary pitching coach, after having worked together with Lutz on the Cleveland Indians' coaching staff. As manager, Lutz had the team change the colors of its caps to red to represent the team's fighting spirit. Unfortunately, Lutz only lasted as Carp manager for 15 games, leaving the team due to an umpiring dispute (although the Carp went on to win its first-ever Central League championship under replacement manager Takeshi Koba).\nFamed manager Leo Durocher was hired as manager of the Taiheiyo Club Lions in 1976, but he retired due to illness (hepatitis) before the beginning of the season.\nWillie Davis 2 time Allstar with 17 seasons in MLB signed with the Chunichi Dragons after the 1976 MLB season and became one of the most famous American players to ever come to Japan. Willie a 3 time Gold Glove winner for the Dodgers in 1971-72-73 for his Centerfield Defense had 2547 hits upon arrival in the Land of the Rising Sun. In 1977 he won the Pacific League player of the month for June but got hurt in early July and with less than 300 ABs he hit 25 HR’s and batted over .300 for 1977. He also had a fine 1978 with the Crown Lighter Lions before coming back to the Majors to finish his career with the Angels in 1979. Davis over 2 seasons in Japan hit 43 HR’s and batted .300.\nLeron Lee played for the Lotte Orions from 1977–1987. He led the league in home runs and runs batted in his first season, and won the batting title in 1980. In 1978, he invited younger brother Leon Lee to play in Japan, and the brothers formed a feared power-hitting duo for the Orions. The African American sidekick role in the 1992 film \"Mr. Baseball\" (played by actor Dennis Haysbert) is believed to be based on the experiences of several African American players in Japan, including the Lee brothers.\nIn 1979 Charlie Manuel led the Kintetsu Buffaloes to their first pennant win, hitting .324 with 37 home runs and 94 RBI, winning the home run title and the Pacific League Most Valuable Player award — the first American to receive the league MVP honor since 1964. Wildly popular for his tenacious style of play and his power-hitting abilities, Manuel was dubbed \"Aka-Oni\" (The Red Devil) by fans and teammates.\n1980s.\n1984 was a turning point for foreign players in NPB. Three American players — Jim Tracy, Don Money, and Richard Duran — all quit their teams in the early part of the 1984 season and went back to the United States — leaving their respective teams in the lurch. The NPB commissioner at the time, Takezo Shimoda, called the American players \"spoiled,\" and proposed banning non-Japanese players from the NPB. A number of other American players enjoyed stellar 1984 campaigns, however, and the threat never was carried out. For instance, Hankyu Braves first-basemen Greg \"Boomer\" Wells hit .355 in 1984, with 37 home runs and 130 runs batted in, winning the NPB Triple Crown and the Most Valuable Player award. He was the first non-Japanese winner of the Triple Crown.\nIn 1984, at 30 years old, Warren Cromartie became the first, and perhaps the most prominent, American player still in his prime to sign with a Japanese baseball team when he joined the Yomiuri Giants before the 1984 NPB season. In , Cromartie batted .378 with 15 home runs and 78 RBIs to be named MVP of the Central League, and lead his team to the Japan Series championship. In the deciding game of the series with the Kintetsu Buffaloes, Cromartie doubled in the fourth inning to ignite a three-run rally and homered in the seventh.\nFirst-basemen Randy Bass is often credited for single-handedly turning around the fortunes of the Hanshin Tigers, which resulted in the team's run and eventual victory of the Japan Series in . Winning the 1985 Most Valuable Player award, he also won four consecutive league batting titles; in , he nearly became the first player in Japan to bat .400, finishing the season with a .389 average, a record that still stands. Bass won consecutive batting Triple Crowns (1985 and 1986). In 1985, he was on a pace to break Sadaharu Oh's record of 55 home runs in a single season, but fell short by one, because in the last game of the season the pitcher from Oh's Yomiuri Giants threw only intentional walks (allegedly to prevent the Westerner from breaking Oh's record). In Japan, his spectacular performance is a legend, and among Tigers fans he is nearly deified, being jokingly referred in conjunction with God and Buddha, \"Kami-sama (God), Hotoke-sama (Buddha), Baasu-sama (Bass)\" (\"sama\" is an honorary variation of \"san\", similar to \"Sir\" or \"His holiness\").\nKintetsu Buffaloes outfielder Ralph Bryant was one of the best left-handed power hitters in Japanese baseball history. In , Bryant hit 49 home runs to lead the Buffaloes to their third Pacific League championship. He won the season MVP award that year, and also tied Sadaharu Oh's career record for hitting three home runs in a game five times. He also struck out countless times, and holds the top four spots on the single-season strikeout records in Nippon Professional Baseball.\n1990s.\nFollowing a brief Major League career, outfielder Alonzo Powell played for seven seasons in Japan. He was just the third player in Central League history, and the first foreign player, to win three straight batting titles, hitting .324, .355, and .340 from 1994 to 1996. He was also a two-time Central League All-Star.\nIn 1995, Tokyo Swallows third-baseman Tom O'Malley hit .307 with 31 home runs and 87 RBIs. The Swallows won the Japan Series that year, and O'Malley was awarded both the season MVP award and the Japan Series MVP award. He hit .300 for six seasons in a row, a record among non-Japanese players in the Japanese professional leagues.\nYokohama BayStars second-basemen Bobby Rose is remembered as one of the best foreign players in Japanese baseball. Rose hit over .300 for seven of his eight seasons in Japan. He also hit three cycles during his career, the most in Japanese baseball history. Rose had his best season in 1999, hitting 37 home runs with 153 RBIs and a .369 batting average. This remains the highest batting average in Japanese baseball among right-handed hitters, and his 153 RBIs ranks second-most in Japanese baseball history. He also led the league with 192 hits, which was a Central League season record. He led the league in hits for the second straight season in 2000, and had the second highest batting average in the Central League.\n2000s.\nTuffy Rhodes played thirteen years in NPB; he is the all-time home run leader for foreign-born players — and tied for 11th overall — with 474 homers in Japan. In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh's Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh's record. (The following year, Alex Cabrera tied the record.) Rhodes' long career in NPB earned him free agency, in which he was treated as a \"Japanese Player\" and not bound to the restrictions of foreign players. Only three other non-Japanese players (Tai-Yuan Kuo, Alex Ramírez, and Alex Cabrera) have achieved such a classification in NPB history.\nIn April 2003, former NPB hitting star Leron Lee was promoted to manager, becoming the first African-American manager in Japanese baseball history. On May 17, 2003, the BlueWave faced the Nippon Ham Fighters, managed by Trey Hillman, for a battle between two American managers in Japan for the first time in 28 years (when Wally Yonamine's Chunichi Dragons faced Joe Lutz' Hiroshima Carp).\nIn 2005, Yomiuri Giants closer Marc Kroon set the record for the fastest pitch ever in Japanese baseball, at 161 km/h (100 mph). In 2008, he broke his own record of pitching to 162 km/h (101 mph).\nIn 2005, Chiba Lotte manager Bobby Valentine led the Marines to their first Pacific League pennant in 31 years after emerging victorious in a close playoff with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. The Marines won the Japan Series in a four-game sweep of the Hanshin Tigers. Following their Japan Series championship, the Marines won the inaugural Asia Series by defeating the Samsung Lions of the Korea Baseball Organization in November 2005. For his efforts, Valentine was awarded the Golden Spirit Award and the Matsutaro Shoriki Award — both firsts for a non-Japanese individual.\nTrey Hillman's Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters won the Pacific League championship in 2006, and returned to defend their title in 2007. It was the first pennant for the franchise in 25 years when they won the championship in 2006, and the repeated success in 2007 was accomplished despite the loss of key players such as Michihiro Ogasawara and Hideki Okajima. His team won the Japan Series and Asia Series in 2006. The team set a franchise-record 14-game winning streak during the 2007 season. Following the example of Chiba Lotte Marines manager Bobby Valentine, Hillman showed his appreciation towards fans by speaking in broken Japanese sentences. After the game in which the Fighters won the pennant in 2006, he shouted \"Shinjirarenai!\", the Japanese phrase stands for \"Unbelievable\", to the fans gathered in Sapporo Dome. He repeated the phrase after winning the Nippon Series, and repeated it again after winning the Asia Championship. Like the Boston Red Sox's \"The Impossible Dream\", Hillman's \"Shinjirarenai\" became the most popular term describing the Fighters' success in 2006. On October 19, 2007, Hillman signed a multi-year contract to manage the Kansas City Royals. He was the first Major League Baseball manager to be hired based on his Japanese baseball record.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, with 214 hits, outfielder Matt Murton of the Hanshin Tigers broke the NPB single-season hit record, and became only the fourth player in Nippon Professional Baseball history to have a 200-hit season.\nIn 2015, relief pitcher Dennis Sarfate recorded 43 saves, a new record for most single-season saves in the Pacific League. On April 2, 2017, Sarfate recorded his 178th save in Japan, setting a new record for most saves by a foreign pitcher in Nippon Professional Baseball history. On July 4, 2017, Sarfate recorded his 200th save, becoming the sixth pitcher in NPB history to reach that threshold and the first foreign pitcher. On September 5, 2017, Sarfate earned his 47th save of the season, breaking the record for most single-season saves in Japanese baseball history. He finished the season with 54 saves. Sarfate earned two saves and a win in the 2017 Japan Series, and won the Japan Series Most Valuable Player Award."

The team plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They compete in the Big Ten Conference of the NCAA, where they have been since 1917. They play their home games at Crisler Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan, named after Fritz Crisler, a former head football coach at Michigan (1938–1947).\nThe men's team has had 17 head coaches in its history. The team has played in 2,538 games over 103 seasons of collegiate play from the 1908–09 season to the 2018–19 season (excluding 1910 to 1917, when the Wolverines did not play due to low attendance and lack of interest), compiling a record of 1,504–1,041 (.591).\nSteve Fisher is the first and only head coach to have led the team to an NCAA Tournament championship, doing so in 1989. He also led the team to six other NCAA Tournament appearances, including two runner-up finishes in 1992 and 1993, but the '92 and '93 Final Fours were vacated as punishment for the University of Michigan basketball scandal.

        "text": "The Dutch cricket team is a national cricket team representing the Netherlands. It is administered by the Koninklijke Nederlandse Cricket Bond (\"Royal Dutch Cricket Association\") which is based in Amstelveen close to Amsterdam and is older than many renowned cricket clubs in the West Indies, Australia, and New Zealand. The Netherlands have participated in the 1996, 2003, 2007 2011, and 2023 Cricket World Cups.\n1996 World Cup.\nIn 1994 the Dutch finally qualified for the World Cup, after finishing third in that year's ICC Trophy. In the World Cup itself in 1996, they were eliminated in the first round, but performed with some credit in their game against England.\n2003 World Cup.\n2001 finally saw the Netherlands win the ICC Trophy, beating Namibia in the final in Toronto. They thus qualified for the 2003 World Cup. They again failed to progress beyond the first round in the tournament, but recorded their first one day international win over Namibia during the tournament. Feiko Kloppenburg (with 121) and Klaas-Jan van Noortwijk (134 not out) scored the first two One Day International centuries in the side's history.\n2007 World Cup.\nIn the 2005 ICC Trophy, the Netherlands finished 5th, qualifying for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and gaining one-day International status until the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier. The 2007 World Cup was in the West Indies, and the Netherlands were eliminated in the first round, though they did beat Scotland along the way.\nIn a match shortened to 40 overs due to wet pitch conditions, South Africa still managed their third 200-run victory at this World Cup, scoring runs at a rate faster than that recorded by Sri Lanka when they set the world record number of runs in a One-day International in July 2006 against this Dutch team. Though Dutch wicket-keeper Jeroen Smits caught Abraham de Villiers for nought in the first over, and South Africa had made four runs in the first five overs, things went South Africa's way from then on. Herschelle Gibbs hit Daan van Bunge for six sixes in the 30th over, a first in ODI cricket, Mark Boucher scored a fifty off 21 deliveries, a World Cup record and two balls off his own South African record, and added another 25 from ten balls before time was up. South Africa also became the first team to make three century partnerships in a One-day International, and hit a World Cup record of eighteen sixes in an ODI.\nFor the Netherlands, Tim de Leede, Daan van Bunge and Luuk van Troost conceded 163 runs in their 12 overs between them, and when batting, the Dutch team's only professional Ryan ten Doeschate was their only man to pass 25, making 57 before he was run out as one of three Dutch batsmen to suffer this fate. Shaun Pollock's six overs cost four runs, the most economical spell of the World Cup thus far.\nThe fourth 200-run win in ten games of the Cup thus far, with Australia becoming the first team to win consecutive One-day Internationals by 200 runs or more. Glenn McGrath became the second bowler in World Cup history to take 50 wickets at the tournament.\nAustralia chose to bat first, losing three wickets by the 20-over mark, with Tim de Leede having both openers caught, but Michael Clarke and Brad Hodge set a World Cup record fourth-wicket partnership with 204, and Australia eventually ended on 358 for five. Hodge's last 28 balls yielded 73 runs. Netherlands' openers Bas Zuiderent and Darron Reekers made 36 at nearly a run-a-ball in the first six overs, but Nathan Bracken had Reekers caught for 25, and four more wickets followed for ten runs. After van Bunge and de Leede had put on 40 for the sixth wicket, Glenn McGrath and Brad Hogg ended the innings.\n2011 World Cup.\nOn 22 February 2011, The Netherlands posted their highest ever total against a full-member nation, scoring 292 against England, batting first at the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Ryan Ten Doeschate top scored 119 from 110 balls. However, the Netherlands were unable to defend their strong total and failed to pull off a huge shock, England winning by 6 wickets with 2 overs to spare. They eventually failed to win any of their group matches and were last in their Group.\nNetherlands captain Peter Borren won the toss and elected to bat first against England, one of the contenders for the trophy. Netherlands started well, with openers Alex Kervezee and Wesley Barresi going at a quick pace but England fought back, getting both openers soon after; and after 33 overs, Netherlands were 149/4. Then Ryan ten Doeschate accelerated, and went on to score a brilliant century, and this, coupled with very poor fielding from England, helped Netherlands plunder 104 runs off the last ten overs and lead them to a strong 292/6.\nThe English started off very strongly in their reply, getting their first 100 runs at a run a ball without losing a wicket. Kevin Pietersen fell soon after, but Netherlands were unable to build on it. England captain Andrew Strauss closed in on a century but holed out and all the England top order batsmen scored runs, with Paul Collingwood and Ravi Bopara taking England home with 1.2 overs to spare.\nThe Netherlands score of 292 was the second highest score from an Associate nation playing against a Test nation."

He was the national coaching director of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, devising the strategies that led Wales to dominate rugby in Europe at that time. He was also a major influence on former Australian national coach Bob Templeton.\nA talented player in his younger years, Williams played for London Welsh, Northampton, Moseley, and East Midlands. He was selected to trial for the Welsh national team as a flyhalf. Williams trained as a PE teacher at Loughborough College and coached the West Midland's region in England. He also staged courses to help teachers become rugby coaches and was the driving force behind the creation of England rugby's coaching manual in the early 1950s. Williams was appointed to the WRU in 1967, and began a transformation of Welsh rugby through conferences and courses which gave Wales more than 300 qualified coaches by the mid-1970s.\nHe became an administrator with the WRU in the 1980s and 90s. Williams was Tournament Director of the Rugby World Cup in Wales in 1991. He received an OBE for services to rugby in 1995. Williams was awarded the International Rugby Board’s Vernon Pugh award for distinguished service in 2014, just weeks before his death after a battle with cancer."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge is a life-size memorial by Adrian Jones, installed in Whitehall, London, England.\nHistory.\nPrince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn was made chairman of the committee to erect a memorial to his cousin Prince George, Duke of Cambridge. Architect John Belcher and sculptor Adrian Jones collaborated on the project. Belcher led on the original proposal in 1905, in which he requested that Westminster City Council should allow the construction of the statue outside Horse Guards on Whitehall. In July 1906, while the statue was being sculpted at Jones' studio on Church Street, Chelsea, he was visited on one occasion by Queen Alexandra, accompanied by her daughter Princess Victoria, Crown Princess Sophia of Greece, Duchess of Sparta, and Prince George of Greece and Denmark.\nBy the following October, the committee changed its mind on the location of the statue. The new War Office building had opened in August, and they requested an amendment to the permission granted by Westminster City Council for a change of building location to place it outside that building instead. Once again, this request was approved. The construction of the plinth was contracted out to a building company, Pethick Brothers, and it was completed on 18 May 1907. Forty-five tonnes of granite was used, and the combined height of the plinth and statue was expected to be some . The statue was added shortly afterwards during the night, and then obscured until the unveiling. It was unveiled on 15 June 1907 by King Edward VII, who had been escorted from Buckingham Palace by a detachment of 2nd Life Guards. He was accompanied on the journey and at the ceremony by Queen Alexandria, Princess Victoria, Edward, Prince of Wales, the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein.\nOther attendees at the ceremony included several members of the of the German Army, of which the Duke had been an honorary colonel. The group was led by Field Marshall Wilhelm von Hahnke. A variety of British military personnel were also present, including Major-General Wykeham Leigh Pemberton. During the ceremony, the King declared, \"The statue I am about to unveil is committed to the care of the City of Westminster.\" This was unexpected, as the statue was actually owned by the Office of Works. Some two weeks passed before the two offices came to agreement that it would be handed back from the City of Westminster to the Office of Works.\nIn November 2012, a nude man mounted the statue for more than an hour until he was persuaded to come down and was taken into police custody.\nDesign.\nJones sculpted the Duke of Cambridge on horseback, while wearing the full-uniform of a Field Marshal. It included his medals, such as four orders of knighthood and his campaign medals. The sculpture holds in its hand a baton, this was intended to represent the one which was presented to the Duke's father by King William IV, and in the other hand it holds the reins of the horse. On the sides of the plinth there are two bas-relief panels showing the Duke's connection with the Grenadier Guards and the 17th Lancers."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, TSN and AP choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2015 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, and Yahoo! Sports. The scholar-athletes selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nOn February 26, 2015, CoSIDA and \"Capital One\" announced the 2015 Academic All-America team, with Matt Townsend headlining the University Division as the men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year. The following is the 2014–15 \"Capital One\" Academic All-America Men’s Basketball Team (University Division) as selected by CoSIDA:\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are called Senior All-Americans.

The plans for Quail Creek Golf &amp; Country Club began in 1960 and the golf course and clubhouse design and construction followed in 1961–62.\nJohnston envisioned turning pasture land into a residential area and a golf country club. Quail Creek came to fruition when a steering committee of businessmen headed by elected Chairman, Boston Smith, met on May 6, 1960. After much research, the committee selected a 158-acre section of farmland which was a familiar landmark to Oklahoma City residents, having been the country home of Virgil Browne, a well known civic leader. The committee agreed that 400 members had to be signed in order to assure that the club could be built and plans began to unfold.\nConstruction.\nThe contract to begin construction of the Club was awarded to Acme Construction Company and ground was officially broken on November 30, 1960. Oklahoma City architectural firm Howard, Samis and Davies was commissioned to design a 40,000 square foot building at an estimated cost of $860,000. They came forward with a building built with more than 2000 tons of creamy beige limestone rock, called Silverdale Stone brought from Silverdale, Kansas. The architects also used large areas of glass.\nAs the Club finally approached completion the gala opening was set for December 16, 1961. At the time, Ernie Vossler was serving as the head professional. Vossler, who died in 2013, was married to 26-time LPGA tournament winner Marlene Hagge. The Club's first greens superintendent was Ken Hubble.\nEvolution of the Club.\nSince 1960, Quail Creek Golf &amp; Country Club has grown and gone through many changes. It has been expanded, remodeled, repaired, redesigned and updated. The structural changes are evident. Other changes were brought about in order to provide the most modern, up-to-date equipment and improvements available.\nQuail Creek Golf &amp; Country Club has played host to many events in the past that include: the Oklahoma City Open 1962 to 1967 (won by Arnold Palmer in 1964 and Tony Lema in 1966), the Southwestern Bell Golf Classic from 1987 to 1990 and the Heartland Pro-Am benefiting the children's daycare center that was devastated in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995. In November 1999, a total course renovation was completed."

Scott's Alabama Crimson Tide football teams of the University of Alabama.\n1922.\nBartlett starred in the first ever meeting against the Oglethorpe Stormy Petrels in 1922. Alabama won 41–0 before 3,000 fans at Tuscaloosa. Bartlett scored five of their six touchdowns in the victory. He scored touchdowns on a 26-yard run in the first, a 15-yard reception from Hulet Whitaker in the second, and on a pair of runs in the third and one in the fourth. In the tie against Sewanee, Bartlett threw a 60-yard touchdown pass to Allen MacCartee. The upset of Penn 9–7 on November 4 was the highlight of the year. Alabama's own website has this account of the winning drive: \"Alabama came back strong in the second quarter on the back of leader Charles Bartlett. Bartlett drove the team down the field on most notably a 22 yard run from the 27 that put the ball on the Penn 4 yard line. Pooley Hubert went in the rest of the way but fumbled the ball in the endzone. Shorty Propst recovered the ball and gave Alabama the 9-7 lead that they would never give up.\" The next week Alabama beat LSU 47–3 in what was then the largest crowd ever to witness a game at Denny Field. Bartlett was responsible for three touchdowns. Bartlett was selected for the All-Southern team of Marvin McCarthy, sporting editor for the \"Birmingham Age-Herald\", and given honorable mention on the All-America team of Walter Camp."

In 1992 Scotland severed their ties with the Test and County Cricket Board and with English cricket, and gained associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in their own right in 1994. They competed in the ICC Trophy for the first time in 1997, finishing third and qualifying for the 1999 World Cup, where they lost all their games. They also qualified for the 2007 and 2015 World Cups.\n1999 World Cup.\n1999 was Scotland's first appearance at the Cricket World Cup, and their matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand were played in Scotland. Scotland were drawn in Group B with Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies. Scotland failed to win a single match, and were eliminated in the group stages.\n2007 World Cup.\nAfter failing to qualify for the 2003 World Cup, Scotland qualified for the 2007 tournament in the West Indies. Once again, Scotland failed to win any of their matches, and were again eliminated in the group stage.\nAustralia were put in to bat and made the seventh-highest total in World Cup history, It was nevertheless the third-lowest total in Scotland's ODI history and the third time a team had won by more than 200 runs in World Cup cricket. Ricky Ponting became the leading Australian run-scorer in World Cups, second overall only to Sachin Tendulkar. In reply, Colin Smith made his first ODI half-century on World Cup debut, and only ten men batted for Scotland; John Blain, one of two players in the eleven with previous World Cup experience, suffered an injury and was absent.\n68% of South Africa's total was made up of boundaries, as Graeme Smith and A. B. de Villiers thumped runs and South Africa qualified for the Super Eights, and the result also confirmed Australia's place. South Africa bowled first, and after Fraser Watts and Majid Haq made it through the first ten overs, South Africa took a wicket every five overs to reduce Scotland to 84 for five after 30 overs. Andrew Hall and Charl Langeveldt took the wickets, but also got hit for runs by Dougie Brown, John Blain and Paul Hoffmann as Scotland posted their highest-ever World Cup total of 186.\nNevertheless, South Africa made their way to the total in half the required time, as Graeme Smith and A. B. de Villiers hit at a rate of more than eight an over. Scotland turned to their spin bowlers in the thirteenth over, with Majid Haq and Glenn Rogers taking three wickets, though they still cost nearly eight an over between them. Justin Kemp hit the winning runs with a six off Rogers.\n2015 World Cup.\nAfter failing to qualify for the 2011 World Cup, Scotland managed to qualify for the 2015 tournament by winning the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Scotland lost all of their group matches, and were eliminated.\nNew Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and put Scotland in to bat. Trent Boult and Tim Southee picked up two wickets each within the first five overs of the innings which left Scotland at 12/4. Both Matt Machan and Richie Berrington then scored fifties before being dismissed by Corey Anderson. Scotland's lower order offered little resistance and their innings ended in 36.2 overs at 142. Anderson and Daniel Vettori picked 3 wickets each for New Zealand.\nIn reply, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals from the start and were 66/3 in the 11th over. Kane Williamson and Grant Elliott put on 40 runs for the fourth wicket, before Williamson fell for 38. Scotland picked another three wickets in quick time to leave New Zealand 137/7 in the 24th over. Vettori scored an unbeaten 8 from 4 balls and New Zealand went on to win the match by 3 wickets. Boult was awarded the Man of the Match for his bowling figures of 6-1-21-2 in Scotland's innings."

At 4,338 mm long, the new SV is 134 mm longer than the Golf Plus that it replaces, 83 mm longer than the Golf hatchback, and 224 mm shorter than the Golf Estate.\nCompared with the boot of its predecessor, the capacity is increased by 76 litres to 500 litres with the back seats at their rear-most position (versus the Golf's 380 litres and the Estate's 605 litres). Moving the rear seats forwards increases the luggage capacity to 590 litres, while folding the rear seats liberates up to 1,520 litres of room. The front passenger seat can also optionally fold fully forward, creating a load space which is up to 2,484 mm long.\nLike the Golf, the Golf SV comes with many standard and optional safety systems. These include a standard automatic post-collision braking system, which automatically brakes the vehicle after a collision to reduce kinetic energy significantly and thus minimise the chance of a second impact, and a PreCrash system (Proactive Occupant Protection) which, on detecting the possibility of an accident, pre-tensions seatbelts and closes the windows and sunroof, leaving just a small gap, to ensure the best possible protection from the airbags.\nA first for the Golf SV is a blind spot monitor, dubbed Side Scan, with an assistant for exiting parking spaces. This monitors the area behind and to the sides of the vehicle, ensuring easier and safer egress when reversing from a parking bay. It will be packaged as an option together with Lane Assist.\nPowertrain.\nPowering the SV is a range of petrol and diesel engines, all of which incorporate Stop/Start and battery regeneration systems. There are two turbocharged 1.2-litre petrol engines with 85 and 105 PS; two 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engines with 125 and 150 PS; and three turbodiesels: a 2.0-litre 150 PS, a 1.6-litre 90 PS and a 1.6-litre 110 PS. When fitted in the Golf SV BlueMotion, this last engine is expected to return fuel economy of 76.3 mpg and emit 95 g/km of . All engines apart from the 1.2-litre TSI 85 PS can be ordered with a DSG gearbox."

        "title": "Ireland at the Cricket World Cup",
        "text": "The Ireland cricket team is the cricket team representing all of Ireland. Since 2017 they have been a Full Member of the International Cricket Council. Although Cricket in Ireland has had a presence since the early 1800s, it was in 1993 the Irish Cricket Union, the predecessor to Cricket Ireland, was elected to the International Cricket Council (ICC) as an Associate member. In the 1997 ICC Trophy, Ireland narrowly missed out on qualifying for the 1999 Cricket World Cup, which was ironically co hosted by Ireland, Scotland, England and the Netherlands. Ireland qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 2007, and has since played in the 2011 and 2015 tournaments, and the 2010, 2012, and 2014 World Twenty20 competitions. Ireland's best performance was in 2007, where they surprisingly qualified for the Super 8 Stages.\nCricket World Cup Record.\nWhite: Group/Round-Robin Stage\n2007 World Cup.\nIreland's performance in their inaugural World Cup in the 2007 tournament took many pundits by surprise. Their first game was on 15 March when they tied with Zimbabwe, primarily thanks to Ireland's first ever World Cup century by man-of-the-match Jeremy Bray and economical bowling in the final overs by Trent Johnston and Andre Botha. In their second match, played on Saint Patrick's Day, they beat the fourth-ranked team in the world, Pakistan, by three wickets, thus knocking Pakistan out of the competition. These two results were sufficient to advance Ireland to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. Their final group stage game was against the West Indies, where they lost by eight wickets. In the Super 8 stage, they lost their four matches against England, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Sri Lanka, but recorded a 74-run victory against the 9th ranked team in the world and Test playing nation Bangladesh. The team received a heroes welcome in Dublin.\nGroup stage.\nIreland had a much better first outing than fellow World Cup debutants Bermuda, managing a tie against the Test nation of Zimbabwe after Jeremy Bray scored his second One Day International century in the space of six weeks. Bray put on 43 with Eoin Morgan for the second wicket, but two wickets from Elton Chigumbura set them back to 64 for four after 15 overs.\nBray remained in, however, carrying his bat to 115 not out and sharing partnerships of 54 with Andrew White, 37 with captain Trent Johnston and 39 with Dave Langford-Smith. Zimbabwe used spinners Prosper Utseya, Sean Williams and Stuart Matsikenyeri at the end, who conceded few runs, ending with combined figures of 56 runs from 17 overs. Chigumbura, who had taken the top order wickets, was not reintroduced at the death.\nIn reply, Zimbabwe made their way to 20 overs with the loss of one wicket, slightly ahead of Ireland's total. However, Johnston broke through when he had Chamu Chibhabha caught, while Vusi Sibanda crept back on the stumps, dismantling a bail to be out hit wicket for 67 as he took off to make a single, not realising his misfortune. Another misfortune struck when Brendan Taylor was run out, essentially by the batsmen on strike (Matsikenyeri) who returned McCallan's ball with a fierce straight drive, taking Taylor's wicket down in the process.\nNevertheless, after Stuart Matsikenyeri's half-century, they required 15 runs with 36 balls remaining; however, they only got six of those runs off the next 30 balls, with Gary Brent and Chris Mpofu rarely managing to get off the strike. Kevin O'Brien, whose only over had cost eight runs, was brought back in the 49th, and he took one wicket and had Mpofu run out in a maiden over. Zimbabwe now needed nine off the last over with only a wicket in hand. Matsikenyeri hit two twos and a single, Ed Rainsford got off the strike with a single off his only ball, before Matsikenyeri tied the scores with a cut for two. With one ball, one wicket and one run in contention, Rainsford's desperate dash caused him to be run out and the match a tie - the third of World Cup history.\nPakistan, ranked fourth in the ICC ODI Championship tables before the tournament, were eliminated from the tournament after five days, an event described by BBC in an online report as \"unthinkable\". Niall O'Brien made 72, but was out stumped with 25 runs still to get and had to watch as his brother Kevin O'Brien and Trent Johnston put on 20 for the eighth wicket to win the game.\nPakistan were put in to bat, and were bowled out for 132, with extras being the top scorer as Ireland offered 23 wides. Pakistan's captain Inzamam-ul-Haq still credited Ireland's bowlers with bowling \"tight lines\", while taking the blame for \"too many poor shots\", as all ten batsmen were out caught. Boyd Rankin took the most wickets, including Younis Khan and top-scorer Kamran Akmal, while Andre Botha's spell of five runs from eight overs also yielded the wickets of Inzamam and opener Imran Nazir.\nWhen Ireland batted, Bray, who had made a hundred in the previous match, fell lbw to Mohammad Sami, who took three for 29 after being left out of the side four days earlier. Ireland fell to 15 for two, but O'Brien and William Porterfield added 37 before Porterfield played a ball from Mohammad Hafeez onto his stumps and was bowled. O'Brien made shots off Hafeez, however, who ended with 15 runs off four overs, one of the three most expensive bowlers of the game. He was eventually stumped for 72, before Iftikhar Anjum struck twice in two balls, Ireland now needing 20 with three wickets in hand. Kevin O'Brien and Trent Johnston got there, however, with Ireland captain Johnston winning the game with a six, the second of the game.\nFollowing the defeat and early exit from the World Cup, there was a huge negative reaction from the millions of passionate Pakistani fans and government, calling for the captain, coach and the president of the board to resign.\nSuper 8 Stage.\nEngland won the toss and batted first, but lost both openers to Boyd Rankin in six overs, before Ian Bell spent 74 balls making his 31. When Bell got out, the run rate was slightly above 4; in the final 28 overs it was in excess of 6, with Paul Collingwood making 90, Kevin Pietersen 48 and Andrew Flintoff 43. Kyle McCallan was the most economical bowler for Ireland, and also took the wicket of Pietersen.\nChasing 267 in reply, Niall O'Brien's third One-day International fifty and his second of the World Cup helped Ireland to a total of 139 for six in the 37th over, but despite faster than a run a ball scores from Trent Johnston and Andrew White Ireland fell 48 runs short as Andrew Flintoff took the final two wickets, though they exceeded their previous World Cup record total by seven runs.\n2011 World Cup.\nThe 2011 World Cup was held between February and March and hosted by Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka. Though Ireland did not progress beyond the first round they secured a historic victory against England. Ireland beat England by 3 wickets with Kevin O'Brien hitting the fastest century in World Cup history, managing the feat in just 50 balls. In passing England's total of 327 for victory, Ireland broke the record for the highest successful run chase in the World Cup.\nBangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss against Ireland and elected to bat, after conceding 370 against India after setting them in. His decision seemed to be vindicated at the start of Bangladesh's innings, with Tamim Iqbal unleashing a flurry of boundaries immediately, to take Bangladesh to 49/0 after 5 overs. Ireland needed a moment of inspiration and they got it from wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien who did a brilliant stumping to send Imrul Kayes on his way. Ireland quickly built on it, with a direct hit from Ed Joyce catching Junaid Siddiqui short, before both Tamim and Shakib were also dismissed softly. Mushfiqur Rahim and Raqibul Hasan staged a recovery then, and at 147/4 in the 34th over, Bangladesh looked well set for a score above 250 until Mushfiqur top-edged a sweep of George Dockrell. This triggered another collapse, and only a late cameo from Naeem Islam took Bangladesh to 205.\nIreland started off solidly in their reply, but then the Bangladesh spinners led by Shakib and Mohammad Ashraful took wickets at regular intervals. The match was evenly poised with Ireland 93/4 after 25 overs. Niall O'Brien was the key to the chase but with the score at 110, he was dismissed after a brilliant catch by Tamim Iqbal. Kevin O'Brien continued to fight, taking Ireland above 150 and giving them another sniff at victory till he holed out to deep square-leg off Shafiul Islam. A pumped-up Shafiul then ran through the tail, and Ireland were all out for 178, falling 27 runs short.\nShafiul Islam recorded the best figures for a Bangladeshi bowler in World Cup matches, with 4/21.\nEngland batted first with Jonathan Trott top-scoring, with 92 from 92 balls. During his innings, Trott reached 1,000 runs in ODI cricket, from just 21 innings, equalling the record set by Vivian Richards and team-mate Kevin Pietersen. England batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell also hit half-centuries, with Trott and Bell sharing a 177 run partnership. England finished on 327/8 from their 50 overs, having only scored 33 runs from their last 5 overs. \nIn reply, Ireland lost their captain, William Porterfield in the very first ball, and were struggling at 111/5 after 25 overs. Kevin O'Brien came in with the score at 106/4, and made 100 in just 50 balls, the fastest century in World Cup history. Ireland scored 62 runs in their batting powerplay, and by the time that Kevin O'Brien was run out for 113 from 63 balls, Ireland required only 11 from 11 balls. Ireland won the match by 3 wickets, with five balls to spare; it was the largest successful run chase in Cricket World Cup history.\n2015 World Cup.\nIreland qualified for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, and were promoted to the ICC ODI Championship, leaving the World Cricket League, but not the ICC Intercontinental Cup. In their first match of the World Cup, Ireland defeated the West Indies by 4 wickets, chasing down 304 runs with 25 balls to spare. In their second match they beat the United Arab Emirates by two wicket with four balls to spare; the target was 279. Out of only five successful World Cup chases of 300 runs or more, Ireland have provided three of them.\nThe West Indies were put into bat by Ireland, who reduced them to 31/2 and 87/5 before Lendl Simmons and Darren Sammy shared a 154 run partnership. They finished their 50 overs with a score of 304/7. In reply, Ireland made 71 runs before losing their first wicket. Paul Stirling and Ed Joyce made a partnership of 106, before Stirling was dismissed. Niall O'Brien finished 79* from 60 balls, to get Ireland over the line with more than four overs remaining. This was Ireland's fourth World Cup victory over a Test playing side and their third successful chase of 300 or more runs in a World Cup."

        "title": "Super Bowl XLV halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XLV halftime show took place on February 6, 2011, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas as part of Super Bowl XLV. The Black Eyed Peas headlined, performing a medley of their songs, with Slash and Usher making guest appearances. Intended to bring youth back into the halftime show, the show received negative reviews from critics.\nBackground.\nA country music halftime show was originally in the planning stages before the Black Eyed Peas agreed to perform. After months of speculation, the selection of the Black Eyed Peas was announced on November 25, 2010. The choice of the Black Eyed Peas was intended to bring youth back into the halftime show, after the NFL had booked legacy artists in the years following the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show and its controversy.\nDevelopment.\nThe show also displayed a long list of other performers, including Prairie View A&amp;M University's \"Marching Storm\" Band.\nThe performance experienced some audio issues.\nFashion.\nMembers of the Black Eyed Peas each wore outfits that were unique from one another's. However, they coordinated their look, with each having a futuristic black-colored outfit.\nFergie wore an LED-embedded costume designed by Anouk Wipprecht and B. Akerlund. Her shoes, on which Wipprecht collaborated with Dutch shoemaker Rene van den Berg, were integrated with Luminex, a light-emitting synthetic fiber. The outfit had a leather skirt and a belt studded with many Swarovski crystals. A football-inspired chest-piece design with flashing LEDs was engineered by Tom Talmon for the outfit.\nTaboo's outfit featured a digital chest plate that switched images to match what song was being performed, for instance, displaying a red heart shape during the performance of \"Where Is the Love?\".\nwill.i.am's outfit was accessorized with a transparent skullcap.\nDuring his guest appearance, Slash wore a top hat, a signature look of his. The top hat he wore was sequined.\nThe show's sizable group of dancers wore LED costumes which could be illuminated various colors. Some in the media likened the visual effect of the illuminated dancers to the visuals of the Tron franchise.\nSynopsis.\nThe show began with the four members of the Black Eyed Peas (will.i.am, Fergie, apl.de.ap, and Taboo) descending via cables onto the stage. The Black Eyed Peas started their performance with \"I Gotta Feeling\". The Black Eyed Peas then began their second song, \"Boom Boom Pow\". Dancers in glowing costumes arranged themselves on the field into shape formations such as arrows and a giant eye. During the performance of \"Boom Boom Pow\", the dancers costumes were illuminated in green. \"Boom Boom Pow\" transitioned into \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", with the two songs briefly overlapping. Slash then rose onto the stage, with Will.i.am. introducing him, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the one and only Slash.\" Fergie then joined Slash, singing the lyrics to \"Sweet Child o' Mine\". For the performance of \"Sweet Child o' Mine\", the dancers' costumes were illuminated in red. This was followed by renditions of \"Pump It\" and \"Let's Get It Started\". Usher then descended onto the stage in a manner similar to how The Black Eyed Peas had originally entered. He performed \"OMG\" with will.i.am.\nThe stage, which consisted of several moving platforms and was illuminated by many lights, was then rearranged to spell the word \"love\". Fergie declared, \"Super Bowl XLV, show us some love,\" before The Black Eyed Peas launch into the song \"Where Is the Love?\".\nThe performance then ended with the song \"The Time (Dirty Bit)\" and a reprise of \"I Gotta Feeling\".\nCritical reception.\nThe performance received a negative critical reception.\nVince Cestone of Bleacher Report called the performance \"uninspiring,\" and wrote that \"The Black Eyed Peas were pathetic—or mediocre at best.\" However, he praised the visual effects of the performance as \"impressive.\" JP Starkey of SB Nation Dallas wrote, \"It wasn't entertaining, it wasn't fun, the songs were brutally bad and didn't translate to a live setting whatsoever.\" Paul Cashmere of Undercover.fm called the performance \"hideous.\" Nekesa Mumbi Moody of the Associated Press declared, \"The Black Eyed Peas brought the youth, but little else,\" but praised Usher's part of the performance as a \"brief exhilarating moment.\" Ben Werner of the \"Orange County Register\" called the performance a \"glittering bore.\"\nA national viewer poll conducted by ESPN found that 35% (a plurality) of respondents graded the performance an \"F\".\nWhen reviewing the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show in 2013, the Associated Press' Mesfin Fekadu retrospectively called the Black Eyed Peas' performance \"disastrous.\" In 2019, Maeve McDermott of \"USA Today\" retrospectively ranked the show as the fifth \"most disastrous\" Super Bowl halftime show, writing, \"The Black Eyed Peas revealed themselves to be a woefully inadequate live act for the halftime show.\" In 2020, Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the performance as the worst-ever Super Bowl halftime show. In 2021, Patrick Ryan of \"USA Today\" wrote that it ranks among the worst halftime shows of the 2010s, calling it a \"futuristic eyesore\".\nSetlist.\nSource: \"Billboard\"/Associated Press"

        "text": " is a 2014 Japanese television drama, starring Yuto Nakajima of Hey! Say! JUMP, Kento Yamazaki and Sakurako Ohara. It is the first drama to have water polo as their main sport. The drama aired from 12 July 2014 to 20 September 2014 with a total of ten episodes.\nPlot.\nNaoya Inaba, who spends the majority of his adolescence abroad, returns to his hometown for his third year of high school. He enrolls in Saku High, which he admires thanks to one of its graduates, Yoshio Kurosawa, a yankee (20th century Japanese delinquent) who saved him from bullies and who encouraged him to never give up in pursuit of his dreams. However, to his dismay, he finds out that Saku High is inhabited by low-lives who resign to being underdogs in the town, and the school itself is about to be closed due to a lack of popularity. Naoya determines to resurrect the spirit of old Saku High by creating a water polo club to compete with Suiran High, a private rival high school whose successful water polo team brings the town out of obscurity.\nNeeding seven members to start the club, Naoya builds friendship with the playful trio Tomoki Kimura, Kohei Shimura, and Shinsuke Kato, the pessimistic but good water polo player Ryuji Mifune, as well as the wild Ryo Chiaki and his friend Koki Miyaguchi. He is assisted by the school math teacher Chiharu Aoyama for advisory purposes. Naoya also gets emotional support from his childhood friend, Nagisa Iwasaki despite her being associated with Suiran High's water polo team, who grows to accept the current Naoya after her initial disappointment of seeing him changing into a yankee.\nSlowly, Naoya learns about the team's problems and bring them from their sulking with a determination to beat Suiran High, whose water polo team is aced by Torao Kitajima, a frenemy of Ryuji who strives to beat the latter to win the heart of Rei Fujisaki, despite the fact that Rei is unconditionally in love with him. Later, Naoya also reunites with Kurosawa, but his expectation is temporarily stripped when he learns that Kurosawa has given up his pride on Saku High. During the Inter-High tournament against Suiran High, Naoya overcomes an injury brought upon by a member of Suiran High and manages to score his team's victory. After the match, Naoya confesses his feelings to Nagisa, who accepts.\nThe epilogue, narrated in a letter from Nagisa to Suiran High's water polo teams' adviser, Mayu Shoji, tells of the events happening after the Inter-High tournament: Saku High is successfully prevented from being closed and its water polo team continues to thrive; Ryuji competes for the national championship team thanks to his performance in the Inter-High tournament; while Kurosawa has regained his faith in Saku High and is training to be its teacher. The series ends with Naoya saving a boy from bullies and advising him never to give up, just as Kurosawa has done to him years before."

Passing into British Railways ownership in 1948, the line was, like the rest of the former GNoS lines along the Moray coast, considered for closure as part of the Beeching report and closure notices were issued in 1963.

        "title": "2016–17 Formula E Championship",
        "text": "The 2016–17 FIA Formula E Championship was the third season of Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) Formula E (FE) motor racing. It featured the 2016–17 FIA FE Championship, a motor racing championship for open-wheel electric racing cars, recognised by FIA, the sport's governing body, as the highest class of competition for electrically powered vehicles. 25 drivers representing 10 teams contested 12 ePrix, starting in Hong Kong on 8 October 2016 and ending in Montreal on 30 July 2017 as they competed for the Drivers' and Teams' Championships.\nThe calendar featured eleven significant changes from the 2015–16 season. The first two were the introduction of the Hong Kong and Marrakesh races, with the latter taking the championship to its first African city. The third was the return of the Monaco ePrix, held for the first time since the 2014–15 season. The fourth was the Berlin ePrix returning to Tempelhof Airport after the event was held along the Karl-Marx-Allee in 2016. The fifth was the New York City ePrix double header, which brought motor racing back to the city for the first time since 1896. The sixth was FE's first visit to Canada for the season-closing Montreal ePrix. The final four changes saw the Long Beach and Punta del Este rounds discontinued due to financial issues, the London double header was cancelled because of opposition to it being held in a public park and the Beijing and Putrajaya were dropped for undisclosed reasons. There were two new teams: car manufacturer Jaguar returned to motor racing as a works team for the first time in 12 years, and Team Aguri was bought by public entity and venture capital firm China Media Capital and renamed Techeetah.\nABT Schaeffler Audi Sport driver Lucas di Grassi secured his first Drivers' Championship in the season-closing race in Montreal. The runner-up was defending champion Buemi, 24 points behind, after missing the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring. Rookie driver Felix Rosenqvist of Mahindra was third, another 30 points adrift. While neither of their drivers won the drivers' title, Renault secured their third consecutive Teams' Championship, ahead of ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport and Mahindra.\nTeams and drivers.\nThe following 10 teams and 25 drivers competed in the 2016–17 FIA Formula E Championship (FE): All teams used Spark chassis.\nTeam changes.\nSeveral team changes took place before the season began. Car manufacturer Jaguar announced their return to motor racing in December 2015 as a works team for the first time since its withdrawal from Formula One (F1) at the end of 2004. It entered the sport in collaboration with Williams Grand Prix Engineering, as a means of expanding their electric vehicle portfolio. Dragon Racing manufactured its own powertrain after using one supplied by Venturi in the previous season. It entered into a technical partnership with American start-up technology company Faraday Future in July 2016 for the next four seasons, with an option for a further four years after the current agreement expires.\nAndretti announced a two-year technical partnership with BMW, enabling the German marque to familiarise itself with the series in view of a potential works team for the 2018–19 season. Team Aguri principal Aguri Suzuki announced he would leave the team in April 2016 as senior personnel entered \"a period of consultation\" over a future change in ownership. In the week before the 2016 London ePrix, the Chinese public equity and venture capital firm China Media Capital announced its purchase of Team Aguri and established a new entity named Techeetah in its place. Senior personnel from Team Aguri, including team principal Mark Preston, retained their jobs with Techeetah, and the cars ran a custom Renault powertrain.\nDriver changes.\nJoining Formula E and changing teams.\n2015 FIA Formula Three European Championship winner and two-time Macau Grand Prix victor Felix Rosenqvist joined the series with Mahindra to partner Nick Heidfeld, in lieu of Bruno Senna, who focused on the World Endurance Championship (WEC) in 2017. Defending FIA GT World Cup champion Maro Engel, who had not driven a single-seater car since the 2007 British Formula Three Championship, was hired by Venturi to replace WEC driver Mike Conway, who left FE to focus on endurance racing. Three-time World Touring Car champion José María López was employed by Virgin Racing to join its regular driver Sam Bird. López had previously driven in single-seater motor racing series such as the GP2 Series with Super Nova Racing, along with occasional testing for the Renault F1 team in 2006.\nJean-Éric Vergne's future at Virgin Racing was under review since February and it was later confirmed he had left the team on 4 July. He signed with the Techeetah team three days later, and was joined by Ma Qinghua, who drove in the 2015–16 season's final three rounds. António Félix da Costa, who spent the previous two seasons with Team Aguri, joined the Andretti team, replacing Simona de Silvestro who moved to Nissan Motorsport in the Australian Supercars Championship in 2017. Jaguar announced their drivers after the pre-season test session at Donington Park. Four drivers were evaluated: 2008–09 A1 Grand Prix champion Adam Carroll, GP2 Series drivers Mitch Evans and Alex Lynn, and European Le Mans Series competitor Harry Tincknell to determine who would suit their team. In September 2016, Jaguar nominated Carroll and Evans to drive for them with three-time FE starter Ho-Pin Tung their reserve driver.\nMid-season changes.\nThe season saw five driver changes. The first was the former Haas F1 driver Esteban Gutiérrez entering FE in January 2017 having explored options with three teams before joining Techeetah. Gutiérrez replaced Ma who could not match teammate Vergne's form in the season's first three rounds; he remained at Techeetah as its third driver. Duval and Engel did not participate in the Paris ePrix because of a Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) commitment at the Lausitzring and were replaced by Conway and Formula V8 3.5 Series champion Tom Dillmann respectively.\nHeading into the Berlin race, Stephane Sarrazin—who had raced for Venturi since the championship started in 2014—was granted permission to leave the team and joined Techeetah to replace Gutiérrez, who deputised for the injured Dale Coyne Racing driver Sébastien Bourdais in the IndyCar Series. His position at Venturi was assumed by Dillmann for the rest of the season. Because the New York City ePrix clashed with the 6 Hours of Nürburgring, López and Sébastien Buemi were required to prioritise the WEC by Toyota and Lynn and 2016 GP2 Series champion and Super Formula driver Pierre Gasly replaced them.\nSeason calendar.\nCalendar changes.\nNew and returning races.\nThe idea for a Hong Kong race first arose in 2013 when a design team visited the city. It was intended for inclusion in the 2014–15 season before schedule negotiations and approval from local authorities, and motorsport's international governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), delayed its debut. In October 2015, the Hong Kong ePrix was announced by FE's CEO and founder Alejandro Agag at a press conference at the Central Harbour Front Event Space pending further review by the FIA. In February 2016, Stéphane Roux, the chief organiser of the World Touring Car Championship, announced to the local press that FE was \"keen\" to hold a race on the streets of Marrakesh in the \"near future\". Both races were confirmed in the final version of the calendar in a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in September 2016.\nAfter being left out of the 2015–16 calendar because it takes the place of the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco every other year, the Monaco ePrix was reinstated for the 2016–17 season with a scheduled date of 13 May to start a three-round streak in Europe. It had been proposed that the principality hold a race following the cancellation of the Moscow ePrix the previous season; it did not proceed because of a lack of preparation time. In December 2016, Berlin city officials voted against the ePrix returning to the Karl-Marx-Allee, citing \"unreasonable road closures and restrictions for residents and road users,\" prompting race organisers to find an alternative venue. Following consultation with city authorities, it was announced two months later that the Berlin ePrix would return to the venue that held the event's first edition in 2015, Templehof Airport, on a revised layout.\nIn March 2014, it was announced that FE was working with New York City authorities to bring a motor race to the area. Agag told CNN in May 2016 that he was \"very optimistic\" about the possibility of hosting an event in the city: \"I've just come from New York looking at different venues, different possibilities. It's far from done yet but we are very optimistic. Our dream would be to have a race in New York.\" On 21 September 2016, officials announced that the New York City ePrix would be held on the 1.210-mile (1.947 km) long Brooklyn Street Circuit in the neighbourhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn. Montreal's Mayor Denis Coderre announced in September 2014 that he had entered into advanced discussions with FIA's President Jean Todt over holding a race in the city. After flying to Miami to meet with series officials six months later, Coderre said in May 2015 that \"informal agreements\" had been reached, and planning for the event commenced in January 2016.\nFailed races.\nA planned race in Brussels was removed from the calendar after local government officials could not agree on a suitable location to hold the ePrix. It was initially agreed that the race be held in the Heysel Plateau area north of the city, until the idea was dropped because finances for it were withdrawn and the Couleur Café music festival was relocated to the area. The series located a replacement venue south in Koekelberg; officials opposed this because of the disruption to early summer transport links. A venue was not found and the race was officially cancelled on 9 March, prompting the series to upgrade the Berlin ePrix to a double header.\nThe Long Beach round was discontinued because a financial agreement to continue hosting the event was not reached, and the Punta del Este ePrix was dropped from the calendar owing to similar consequences with the Uruguayan government. The London ePrix double header was cancelled after a local community group brought a High Court challenge against FE because it opposed the race being held in Battersea Park. The Beijing and Putrajaya races were discontinued for undisclosed reasons.\nRule changes.\nThe start of the first practice session took place 15 minutes later to accommodate Roborace, the autonomous racing car series which held demonstration runs during the season. Unlike previous seasons, only one point was offered to the driver who recorded the fastest lap of a race to reduce the possibility that the championship would be decided by the additional award.\nA 50% increase in the available regeneration progress from to was made possible by an evolution of the Williams Advanced Engineering-constructed battery, expanding the amount of possible strategies to drivers. The maximum amount of usable power during the race weekend remained at for season three. It was planned to increase the maximum amount of permitted power to in season four and in season five following extensive battery performance and cost analysis. Battery cell weight was increased from to and the car's maximum weight fell from to .\nWith regard to battery management, \"power ramping down\" was introduced whereby cars that exceeded their maximum power usage during the race were required to linearly ramp down to within five seconds on the track, and the car's rain light had to illuminate to alert other drivers. After the car crossed the line to mark the entry to pit lane, the driver had to engage the motor-generator unit to continue racing or return to the pit lane if this was unsuccessful. The change was introduced to aid spectators on energy usage rule transgressions without relying on a steward's decision.\nFor the new season, tyre supplier Michelin introduced an upgraded version of its all-weather tyre, which provided less rolling resistance, a weight reduction, and better energy management. The tyres were expected to gain optimum temperature faster and have the same high amount of longevity as the previous generation of tyres. The front wing mounted on all cars was redesigned for a more aggressive cosmetic appearance, and to give the series \"a strong visual identity\" to distinguish itself from other motor racing championships. Cars also ran with a redesigned steering wheel, which provided drivers with additional functionality options and provided them with the new strategic choices made possible by battery modifications. Starting from the Berlin ePrix, teams were required to display a driver's name and racing number on the car's external bodywork for improved visual identification for spectators.\nRace summaries.\nPre-season.\nTwo pre-season test sessions, held at Donington Park, were conducted on 23 to 25 August and 5 to 7 September 2016. The test sessions saw quick times laid down throughout, and marked the first usage of Michelin's new tyre compound in both dry and wet weather conditions. Reigning champion Sébastien Buemi and Jean-Éric Vergne were the two fastest overall drivers on the third day of running; 1.5 seconds covered the field in terms of outright pace on a circuit almost twice the length of a standard ePrix track.\nRound 1 – Hong Kong.\nThe season opener in Hong Kong had its qualifying shortened due to multiple crashes causing several stoppages. The starting order was determined by the fastest drivers in the four qualifying groups. Nelson Piquet Jr. earned the first pole position of his career ahead of his teammate Oliver Turvey in second. He took an early lead from Turvey as the field was bottle-necked by contact in turns one and two. Di Grassi was caught off guard by Ma braking, and rammed into his car, removing the right-front section of his nose cone. While Piquet pulled clear from the rest of the field, di Grassi was required to enter the pit lane for a replacement front wing and made his stop on the eighth lap.\nBird had risen to second after passing Turvey two laps previously; he took the lead from Piquet when the latter reacted late to López's stricken car at the complex composing turns three and four on lap 17, and crashed into a barrier. Piquet resumed by selecting reverse gear and emerged without damage to his car. The safety car was deployed to enable the extrication of López's car from the track and for marshals to repair the barrier. Some drivers elected to switch into their second cars at the end of the 20th lap. Having chosen not to make a pit stop, Bird led for five laps until a problematic pit stop lost him positions, and elevated Buemi to first place and di Grassi second. Buemi was unchallenged for the rest of the race en route to his first victory of the season and the seventh of his career.\nRound 2 – Marrakesh.\nIn the first FE race on the African continent, Rosenqvist earned his maiden career pole position in his second race start and Mahindra's first. Buemi, who took second, was demoted five places on the starting grid because of an underweight fire extinguisher that was emptied by a possible leak. Rosenqvist took an early lead with a brisk getaway off the line. Shortly after, an information display error on his steering wheel's dashboard limited the information available to him. Rosenqvist had opened a five-second advantage over Bird; Vergne caught Rosenqvist by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Albeit with less electrical energy, Vergne caught and overtook Bird for second on the 16th lap. On the same lap, the pit stops for the mandatory car change began when Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane, promoting Bird and Buemi to first and second. Buemi was faster than Bird and passed him on the following lap before both drivers made their pit stops.\nAfter the pit stops, Rosenqvist retook first place and retained most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. The latter incurred a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane and took it on lap 23, ending his chances of winning. Because he made a pit stop one lap earlier than the rest of the field, Rosenqvist slowed to conserve electrical energy, allowing Buemi to draw closer at the rate of two seconds per lap with FanBoost aid. Buemi slipstreamed Rosenqvist and braked later than him to gain the lead on the 29th lap. Rosenqvist struggled with his energy usage, and his slower pace allowed Bird to pass him for second with two laps to go. While Rosenqvist focused on preserving electrical energy, Buemi took his second consecutive win, and the eighth of his career.\nRound 3 – Buenos Aires.\nThe championship resumed four months later in Buenos Aires. It was announced in November 2016 that the Buenos Aires race would be the last to be held at the Puerto Madero Street Circuit due to redevelopment in the Puerto Madero area. For the third consecutive race, the pole sitter secured his maiden first position start. This time di Grassi secured the accolade by nearly-two-tenths of a second over Vergne. Di Grassi kept the lead at the beginning of the event, and Vergne held off Buemi for second place. Carroll remained stationary at his grid slot on the opening lap; he was able to start his car and racing resumed on the next lap. Vergne immediately began challenging for first and overtook di Grassi at turn four on the third lap to move into the lead.\nBuemi passed di Grassi three turns later to claim second place while Vergne established a small lead over Buemi. Buemi got a better exit leaving the final corner and out-braked Vergne for the lead three laps further on. Di Grassi struggled with his car's handling, enabling Turvey to pass him for third, and he was put under pressure by the other car of Prost. The pit stop phase began on lap 18 and when it ended Buemi regained the lead. Six laps later, di Grassi returned to third by capitalising on a driving mistake by Prost. Di Grassi pushed hard in an attempt to close up to Vergne; the latter responded by stabilising the time deficit to two seconds. Buemi had braking difficulties with his second car rendered him unable to brake in a straight line, and won his third race of the season and the ninth of his career. He also became the first driver in FE to win three consecutive ePrix.\nRound 4 – Mexico City.\nPrior to the race, Techeetah announced that former Haas F1 driver Esteban Gutiérrez would replace Ma Qinghua in the team's second car. For the only time in the season, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start from pole position. Daniel Abt set the fastest time; a hefty grid penalty for tyre pressures that were below the minimum of left him 18th overall. Second-place qualifier Maro Engel was demoted ten places because of a gearbox change. This promoted Turvey to his first career pole position. He retained his startline advantage on the first lap. As the field concertinaed through turns three and five, Engel hit di Grassi's car and damaged his rear wing. Di Grassi made an unscheduled pit stop for a replacement rear wing. The safety car was deployed on the second lap for marshals to clear debris and di Grassi avoided going a lap behind the leaders. Turvey kept the lead at the restart three laps later. López followed Turvey until the latter retired with power issues, promoting López to first place, and necessitating the safety car's second appearance.\nWith the field closed up, di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch to their second cars on the 18th lap. The change enabled the duo to gain positions when other drivers made their stops; it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the end of the race's. Di Grassi and d'Ambrosio moved into first and second places after the field entered into their second cars between laps 24 and 26. The safety car was deployed after Loïc Duval retired with a battery issue. The safety car was withdrawn on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead and conserved his electrical energy usage enough to make the finish, securing his first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Elsewhere in an action-packed race, Buemi finished 14th after spinning attempting to overtake Rosenqvist, and earned one point for setting the fastest lap. Di Grassi's victory brought with it twenty-five points and put him five points behind Buemi in the championship contest.\nRound 5 – Monaco.\nThe European leg of the season commenced in Monaco. The fifth consecutive driver to clinch pole position in the season came to fruition when Buemi recorded the fastest time in qualifying. He took an early lead with second-place starter di Grassi close behind. Buemi established a small advantage of one second over di Grassi. On the eighth lap, Bird drove over the kerbing at Tabac corner and damaged his suspension in an impact with a barrier. He was shown a black flag with an orange disc, requiring him to enter the pit lane for car repairs. His teammate López was mandated to do the same after officials noted damage to his rear wing. Both drivers began a battle to set the race's fastest lap. Piquet could not remain with the leaders and Vergne closed up to him. Vergne steered right onto the inside line on lap 21. As the two locked their tyres, Piquet clambered with his steering wheel, and the two made contact. Vergne's race ended prematurely at the wall, and Piquet continued driving. The safety car was deployed to enable Vergne's car to be extricated from the track, and drivers made pit stops for the compulsory switch into their second vehicles.\nBuemi led the field at the lap-26 restart, followed by di Grassi and Nick Heidfeld. After one lap under racing speeds, Buemi again pulled clear from di Grassi to establish a one-second advantage over him. Buemi attempted to level out the electrical energy difference between himself and di Grassi by conserving energy and used his FanBoost to keep the lead. Di Grassi narrowed the gap to Buemi—who had less electrical energy available—to half a second with six laps to go. While pondering an overtake on Buemi, slower traffic delayed the two, causing di Grassi to drop back. Di Grassi was also awarded FanBoost; he could not use it because of battery voltage limitations. He drew closer to Buemi on the final lap and forced the latter to defend his position, as he could not find the space to get ahead as the run to the start/finish line was not long enough. It allowed Buemi to repel di Grassi, for his fourth win of the season, and the tenth of his career.\nRound 6 – Paris.\nDuval and Engel missed the Paris ePrix because of a DTM commitment at the Lausitzring and were replaced by Toyota WEC driver Mike Conway and Formula V8 3.5 Series champion Tom Dillmann. In qualifying Buemi became the first driver to achieve his second pole position of the season. Buemi blocked an overtake by Vergne to maintain the lead at the start. After the first lap passed without incident, the field established themselves and the first on-track battles commenced. Upfront, Buemi led Vergne by one second as Gutiérrez lost positions because he was slower than the leaders. After passing Dillmann, Antonio Félix da Costa gained on di Grassi and overtook him; di Grassi remained close behind Félix da Costa.\nDi Grassi attempted to pass Félix da Costa on lap 16. He moved in front, as both cars made contact, causing them to spear into the wall. The stewards investigated the collision and took no action against di Grassi. The incident prompted the activation of the full course yellow procedure. Most drivers, including Buemi, clambered into their second cars. Conway led for three laps before making his own stop. Vergne drew closer to Buemi on lap 34. He suspected a defective mechanical arm loosening his steering. He ran wide leaving turn 13, damaging his vehicle's front-right corner in a collision with a barrier, ending his race. Vergne's stricken car necessitated the safety car's deployment, and racing resumed four laps later with Buemi closely followed by López and Heidfeld. With two laps remaining, di Grassi locked his tyres and crashed into the wall, prompting the race to end behind the safety car for the second consecutive year. This enabled Buemi to take his fifth victory of the season and the 11th of his career. The result gave Buemi a season-high Drivers' Championship lead of 43 points.\nRounds 7 and 8 – Berlin.\nFirst race.\nOne week before the first Berlin ePrix, two more driver changes occurred when Gutiérrez left Techeetah to deputise for the injured Dale Coyne Racing driver Sébastien Bourdais in the IndyCar Series. Stéphane Sarrazin took his seat with Dillmann driving the second Venturi car. Di Grassi—nursing an ankle injury he sustained in a charity football match four days prior to the first race— took his second pole position of the season with the closest margin in FE history, 0.001 seconds over López. Di Grassi took an early lead, as a slow getaway from López meant the Mahindras of Heidfeld and Rosenqvist passed him. By the start of lap five, di Grassi led Rosenqvist by 1.2 seconds and the latter required extra electrical energy to attack in the race's closing stages.\nEntering the pit stop phase, Rosenqvist reduced di Grassi's lead to three-tenths of a second, and took the lead from the electrical energy conservative di Grassi on lap 22. After every driver switched into a second car, Rosenqvist remained the leader with di Grassi in second and holding back on using his FanBoost for an attack on him. Heidfeld began to close up on di Grassi. Rosenqvist opened up a two-second advantage over the slower di Grassi and the latter activated his FanBoost to defend from the closing Heidfeld. Rosenqvist led the rest of the race to achieve his (and Mahindra's) first FE victory. Elsewhere, Buemi recovered from a sub-par qualifying performance to finish fifth on the road. He was later disqualified because all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of .\nSecond race.\nRosenqvist carried over his strong form into the second race with his second career pole position by nearly one-tenth of a second over Buemi. He maintained his pole position advantage on the first lap and opened up a two-second lead over Buemi. At this early stage of the race, Rosenqvist was instructed over the radio to preserve electrical energy by lifting and coasting. His teammate Heidfeld— who qualified 20th (and last) because a throttle sensor malfunction prevented him from recording a maximum power lap— caught Mitch Evans's Jaguar and challenged him for the final points-scoring position of tenth by the 13th lap. Upfront, Rosenqvist and Buemi pulled away from López and both were separated by a second. López was challenged by teammate Bird for third; the latter had difficulty overtaking until Bird executed a failed overtake four laps later that resulted in contact. Bird fell to seventh behind Vergne, di Grassi and Abt.\nAt this stage, Buemi was 1.3 seconds adrift of Rosenqvist; the latter was aware of the situation and glanced at his rear-view mirrors to ensure his advantage was large enough to remain ahead after the pit stops. The mandatory pit stop phase for the switch into a second car began on lap 23 when the leaders entered the pit lane. After exiting his team's garage, Rosenqvist was released into teammate Heidfeld's path, causing the latter to swerve and nearly enter another team's pit lane gantry. Even after the delay, Rosenqvist remained the leader. He was immediately investigated by the stewards, and built up a steady advantage over Buemi as he was aware of the possible implications of his pit stop release. After reviewing Rosenqvist's pit stop release, he was imposed a ten-second post-race time penalty. Rosenqvist crossed the start/finish line after 46 laps to finish first on the road, 2.9 seconds ahead of Buemi. With the application of Rosenqvist's penalty, Buemi was declared the winner, his sixth of the season and the 12th of his career.\nRounds 9 and 10 – New York City.\nFirst race.\nBuemi and López missed the New York City ePrix since the race clashed with the 6 Hours of Nürburgring. They were replaced by 2016 GP2 Series champion and Super Formula driver Pierre Gasly and GP2 Series driver Alex Lynn. In the first motor race held in New York City since 1896, Lynn clinched pole position in his maiden ePrix ahead of Abt. Wheelspin from Lynn at the start promoted Abt to first place. He could not pull away from the field because he conserved electrical energy. Bird grew frustrated with teammate Lynn defending and was later granted permission to overtake him for second on lap nine and quickly challenged Abt for the lead. Meanwhile, Abt had brake trouble and his team requested he focus on restoring electrical energy. Bird used this handicap to his advantage, and after twice failing to pass him, overtook Abt for the lead on lap 16. Electrical energy management issues swiftly demoted Lynn from second to fifth by lap 17. By this point, Heidfeld attacked Abt, as Vergne drew closer to him; both demoted Abt to fourth.\nAbt regained the lead temporarily for one lap when the field made pit stops. Bird later reclaimed the position with Vergne second. Swift work from Sarrazin's crew enabled him to gain the most places and move into fourth while Heidfeld fell to eighth. Di Grassi drove cautiously in his attempt to find space for a pass on Rosenqvist. He passed Rosenqvist when the latter spun into a barrier on lap 33 and was required by officials to make a pit stop for car repairs. Heidfeld's right-rear suspension collapsed from heavy contact with a kerb and stopped on the track on the 37th lap, necessitating the safety car's deployment. This prompted a two-lap sprint to the finish from lap 42 with Bird leading. Sarrazin took third after Abt slowed with a battery management system failure on the final lap; Abt narrowly avoided collecting his teammate di Grassi as he endeavoured to rejoin the race. Vergne attempted to pass Bird by braking later than him, but he was not close enough to affect an overtake. Bird held the lead to claim his fourth career victory and become the first driver to win a motor race in New York City.\nSecond race.\nBird carried his winning form from the previous day's race to earn pole position with a 0.037-second margin over Rosenqvist. Drivers ran six more laps in the second race, making battery management the primary concern. For the second consecutive ePrix, it was not the pole sitter who led as Rosenqvist accelerated faster than Bird to lead the first lap. Bird kept within reach of Rosenqvist in the opening laps, as Heidfeld gained on both drivers. The first full course yellow was prompted on lap nine when Evans hit a barrier near the entry to the pit lane and had difficulty reversing. Shortly after the restart, Bird caught Rosenqvist off guard and passed him for the lead on lap 11. Bird began to pull away from the field. A second full course yellow came nine laps later when Lynn stopped on the back straight with a technical problem, and it prompted several drivers to make pit stops. Bird remained on track for one additional lap before making his stop, giving him more electrical energy than the drivers behind him.\nWhen racing resumed, Bird used the restart to increase his lead to three seconds over the Mahindra cars without overusing electrical energy. Mahindra located an energy readout issue on Rosenqvist's car, and the team prompted Heidfeld to pass him for second on lap 36 to see whether he could draw closer to Bird and pass him. Rosenqvist fell behind quickly so that his problem could be solved in a calmer environment. This allowed Bird to extend his advantage by another second. Heidfeld allowed his teammate Rosenqvist to reclaim second on the 48th (and penultimate) lap. An oversteer in the race's final moments did not deter Bird, who took his second consecutive victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Gasly caught Rosenqvist and Heidfeld on the final lap; all three drivers concertinaed through the final turn. As he challenged Heidfeld for third, an overspeed for Gasly caused him to drift into a wall lining the track. He hurled a detachable barrier onto the circuit, which no other driver collected. After the race weekend, di Grassi narrowed Buemi's championship lead to ten points heading into the season-closing Montreal ePrix.\nRounds 11 and 12 – Montreal.\nFirst race.\nA maximum of 59 points were available for the final ePrix which meant Buemi could still win the title if di Grassi won both races and Buemi took two pole positions and finished second twice. A heavy crash in the second practice session by Buemi prompted his team to construct a new car around a spare monocoque. He incurred a ten-place grid penalty for a change of battery. Di Grassi took his third career pole position by 0.196 seconds over Buemi in qualifying; the latter's penalty demoted him to 12th. Di Grassi held off Sarrazin at the start to lead the first lap. Buemi's conservative driving delayed him in a tight pack of cars and sustained steering damage from contact with Robin Frijns. While di Grassi pulled away to establish a large lead, attention switched to Buemi who gained positions. On the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to pass Duval; the latter defended and the two made contact. Duval continued driving and Heidfeld sustained front-right suspension damage. The full course yellow procedure was activated to allow for Heidfeld's damaged car to be removed from the track. This prompted most of the field to enter the pit lane and switch into their second cars.\nBuemi was frustrated at Abt in the pit lane and Abt rammed into Buemi's rear. Swift work from Vergne's pit crew elevated him to third. His teammate Sarrazin ceded second and Vergne gained on di Grassi. López lost control of his car's rear on lap 24, and spun into a barrier, necessitating the safety car's deployment. The safety car was withdrawn five laps later, and racing resumed with di Grassi using his FanBoost to pull clear from Vergne's Techeetah. Vergne drew close to di Grassi in the final two laps. Di Grassi defended the lead from Vergne. Buemi closed up to third-place Sarrazin on the final lap; he did not get ahead, as di Grassi won the event. A visibly angered Buemi argued with Félix da Costa, Frijns and Abt after the race. He was later disqualified due to an underweight second car. Renault did not appeal. Hence, di Grassi displaced season-long championship leader Buemi and held an 18-point advantage going into the season's final race.\nSecond race.\nIn qualifying for the second Montreal race, Rosenqvist took his third pole position with Bird in second. Di Grassi took fifth while a driving error restricted Buemi to 13th. Rosenqvist kept his pole position advantage on the first lap. Sarrazin spun following contact with Piquet, and Abt and blocked the track at the first turn. Buemi's right-rear wheel guard flailed and detached from contact with Félix da Costa. He was shown a black flag with an orange disc, requiring him to enter the pit lane for repairs. The loose bodywork part fell off his car and his short pit stop lost him positions. After ten laps, Vergne mounted an attack on Rosenqvist for the lead as the former had more usable electrical energy than the Mahindra ahead of him. He could not find any space to move in front. The mandatory change for drivers to switch into their second cars began on lap 18 when Engel and Piquet became the first drivers to enter the pit lane. Rosenqvist followed on the next lap with Vergne, López and both ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport cars of di Grassi and Abt staying on track for an additional lap to allow all four drivers to run in clean air.\nDi Grassi's strategy of staying out for one extra lap did not work as his pit stop lasted two seconds longer than the agreed minimum pit stop time. He emerged in tenth, behind his teammate Abt. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist reclaimed the lead with a five-second advantage over Vergne. Vergne drew closer to race leader Rosenqvist on the 29th lap and took advantage of the latter lifting and coasting to overtake him for the lead. The improved top speed of Vergne enabled him to pull away quickly from Rosenqvist. López caught and could not pass Rosenqvist in the race's final laps. Vergne maintained the lead for the remainder of the race to clinch his maiden FE victory after securing eight podium results in the preceding three seasons. It was Vergne's first motor racing victory since the 2011 Formula Renault 3.5 Series round at Circuit Paul Ricard. Di Grassi advanced through the field to finish seventh and won his first Drivers' Championship. As Buemi finished 11th, and Prost took a solitary point for the fastest lap, Renault retained the Teams' Championship for the third successive season.\nResults and standings.\nDrivers' standings.\nPoints were awarded to the top ten classified finishers in every race, the pole position starter, and the driver who set the fastest lap, using the following structure:\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance.\nTeams' standings.\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance."

        "text": "The Fiji national under-19 cricket team represents the Republic of Fiji in international under-19 cricket. The team's first recorded match came at the 1997 Youth Asia Cup, but the majority of its matches have come in the EAP Under-19 Trophy, against other teams in the ICC East Asia-Pacific (EAP) region. Fiji won the 2015 edition of the tournament, and consequently qualified for the 2016 Under-19 World Cup, becoming the first team to qualify from the region after Papua New Guinea.\nHistory.\nCricket has been played in Fiji since 1874, during the time of the Kingdom of Fiji, when British sailors aboard HMS \"Pearl\" introduced the sport to Levuka. It quickly became popular amongst the native Fijians, and the Fijian national side became regular visitors to Australia and New Zealand, playing a number of first-class matches. The Fiji Cricket Association gained associate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1965, one of the first three countries to do so, along with Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and the United States.\nOrganised under-19 international cricket dates only from the 1970s – the first under-19 Test and One Day International (ODI) were played in 1974 and 1976, respectively, while the first Under-19 World Cup was held in 1988. The Fijian under-19 side's first recorded matches came at the 1997 Youth Asia Cup, which was part of the qualification process for the 1998 World Cup. Their first game was a 134-run loss to Singapore, which was followed by nine-wicket losses to Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong.\nAlthough both Fiji and Papua New Guinea had each recently left the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) to join the recently formed ICC East Asia-Pacific (EAP) organisation, they continued to participate in ACC tournaments for several years, as few EAP tournaments had yet been organised. Fiji did not participate at the 1999 Youth Asia Cup (the qualifier for the 2000 World Cup), but the following year hosted the inaugural edition of the EAP Under-19 Cricket Trophy. With Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea the only other participating teams, the tournament was played as a double round-robin, with Fiji winless from their four matches. However, in Fiji's first game against Hong Kong, Colin Rika score 129 runs opening the batting, the team's first recorded century, and a tournament record until surpassed by Vanuatu's Andrew Mansale at the 2007 tournament.\nNo standalone EAP qualifying tournament was held for the 2004 and 2006 World Cups, with two EAP teams (Fiji and Papua New Guinea) instead participating in a combined tournament with African Cricket Association teams. Fiji finished last at the 2003 combined tournament, hosted by Namibia, but did win their first competitive match, defeating Tanzania by two wickets. However, they had earlier lost their opening match against Kenya by 320 runs, conceding 356 runs before being bowled out for 36. At the 2005 combined tournament, Fiji lost all its group matches, but defeated Nigeria by two wickets in the eighth-place playoff, having bowled them out for 46.\nThe 2007 EAP Under-19 Trophy, the first since 2001, included Japan and Vanuatu for the first time, and Fiji were consequently able to win their first match against another EAP side. In their first innings against Japan (playing only its third recorded under-19 match), Fiji scored 440/8 from its 50 overs, with their captain, Josefa Rika, scoring 257 runs from 147 balls, including 37 fours and 9 sixes. They then dismissed Japan for 53 runs, winning the match by 387 runs. Sekope Biauniceva took 6/13, and both he and Rika's performances remain Fiji under-19 records. A writer for ESPNcricinfo described Rika's innings as \"what must rank as one of the most breathtaking knocks in the history of age-group cricket\"."

Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota and featured the East Regional Champion, #1-seeded Duke versus the Midwest Regional Champion, #2-seeded Arizona.\nParticipants.\nArizona Wildcats.\nFeaturing future NBA stars Richard Jefferson and Gilbert Arenas along with Wake Forest transfer Loren Woods, future NBA player and coach Luke Walton and future Harlem Globetrotter Eugene \"Wildkat\" Edgerson, Arizona entered the season ranked #1 and entered the tournament as the #2 seed in the Midwest Regional.\nThe Wildcats would crush Eastern Illinois and Butler to reach the Sweet 16. Arizona would beat #3 Ole Miss 66-56 and #1 Illinois to reach the Final Four.\nIn an emotional season in which coach Lute Olson suffered the loss of his wife Bobbi, he would be just 40 minutes away from a second national championship after his Wildcats blew out defending national champion Michigan State. The game was close at halftime with Arizona leading by just 2. However, Arizona outscored Michigan State 48–31 in the second half en route to the 19-point victory.\nDuke Blue Devils.\nFeaturing Carlos Boozer, Jay Williams and national and Defensive Player of the Year Shane Battier, the Blue Devils would travel the same path they took nine years ago when they claimed their last championship in 1992 and became the first team since UCLA in 1972 and 1973 to repeat as national champions, from Greensboro to Philadelphia to Minneapolis. In their first four games of the tournament, Duke bested Monmouth, Missouri (coached by Duke player and assistant and future NBA coach Quin Snyder) and Los Angeles rivals UCLA and USC all by double digits.\nIn the Final Four, they met ACC rival Maryland for the fourth time that season after both road teams won during the ACC regular season before Duke won 84–82 in the ACC tournament semifinals in Atlanta en route to winning the tournament. Finding themselves down 39–17 with 6:57 to play in the first half and down 49–38 at the half, Duke went on to stage a comeback against the Terrapins and win 95–84 to advance to the championship game. Duke's 22-point deficit and 11-point halftime deficit marked the largest comeback in Final Four history.\nGame Summary.\nThe second-ranked team coming into the NCAA Tournament would leave giving both the school and coach Mike Krzyzewski their third national championship. Arizona cut Duke's lead to 39–37 early in the second half, but Mike Dunleavy Jr. – with his father, NBA coach Mike Dunleavy Sr., in the stands – connected on three consecutive three-pointers during an 11–2 Duke run on his way to a team-high 21 points. The Wildcats got back within 3 four times, including twice inside the four-minute TV timeout. However, Battier proved himself too much for the Wildcats to handle as he hit two critical shots to keep the Blue Devils comfortably ahead. Jay Williams, despite a poor shooting night, iced the game with a three-pointer from the top of the key off a Battier screen that gave give Duke an 80–72 lead with under 2 minutes to play.\nFollowing the season, Krzyzewski was also inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Earlier in the season, the court at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham had been named Coach K Court after the Blue Devils' second game of the year, a victory over Villanova in the second round of the NIT Season Tip-Off (then the Preseason NIT) that was Krzyzewski's 500th victory as Duke head coach."

        "text": "Armée de terre, officially Équipe cycliste Armée de terre, () was a French UCI Continental cycling team. It was sponsored by the French Army and all the cyclists were professional soldiers. After competing with success in the French amateur structure, the team was registered as a Continental-level team from the beginning of the 2015 road cycling season until its disbandment at the end of the 2017 season.\nHistory.\nAmateur racing.\nThe team was founded in 2010 by David Lima Da-Costa following a long history of the French Army supporting soldiers in their cycling careers, with the team's first season of racing being the 2012 cycling season. It was founded with the intention of aiding in the Army's recruitment efforts. The team offered unusual benefits to its riders, such as a potential career in the Army, accommodation and training facilities rarely provided by a domestic team. The team received approximately 40 applications from riders wishing to join it for its first season, which included top-level amateurs and some professional riders. The hiring process was made more complicated by the requirement to enlist the riders as soldiers.\nThe team had a budget that would have supported a Continental team, but the management initially chose to set the team up to compete in the French domestic championship, the Division Nationale. In the team's first season, it finished fourth in the second division of the Division Nationale and was promoted to the first division for the 2012 season. After 22 victories in 2012, the team finished a close second in the 2013 Coupe de France Division Nationale 1, finishing behind Vendée U despite leading for three quarters of the season. The team went on to dominate the 2014 domestic racing season in France, winning 61 races as they won the amateur Coupe de France.\nContinental team.\nHaving received continued support from the military leadership for another four years, the team began exploring promotion to become a UCI Continental team, with support from civilian sponsors. The success of this application was announced in December 2014, with the team finding out through a leak to the press. This promotion was complicated by the rules about French cyclists. Riders on UCI Continental teams are not considered professionals by the UCI, but the rules of French cycling mandate professional contracts for them. Since the riders on Armée de terre are soldiers rather than professional cyclists, a special exception had to be made to allow the team to compete. The team retained several of its riders from the 2014 season into the international ranks, including French under-23 champion Yann Guyot. The riders continued to live in the team's base, two to each room; if a race did not provide accommodation to the riders, they stayed in the nearest military barracks. Each rider did military training in the two months of the off-season, learning a military specialism as well as training as a cyclist.\nThe team's jersey in this as in previous years is a camouflage design promoting the team's military foundation. The team's bicycles, provided by Mario Cipollini's company, are also decorated with a camouflage pattern.\nThe team made its debut at this level in the 2.1-ranked Étoile de Bessèges. They then rode the 2015 Tour du Haut Var, where Quentin Pacher finished fifteenth overall and won the white jersey for the best young rider. The following weekend, the team achieved top 10 results in two French races: eighth place in the Classic Sud-Ardèche for Romain Combaud and seventh in the La Drôme Classic for Yann Guyot, who was the leading group behind the race winner, Samuel Dumoulin ().\nThe team's first victory came at the Tour du Loir-et-Cher, where Guyot won stage 3 in a two-man sprint.\nTeam roster.\nRiders' military ranks.\nAs the members of the Armée de terre team were all soldiers as well as cyclists, they all had military ranks. Most of them were graded as \"soldat de deuxième classe\", the lowest rank in the French Army. Barbas, Le Roux and Levasseur were \"soldats de première classe\", the next highest rank; Combaud and Guyot were \"caporaux\", while Sinner held the equivalent rank of \"brigadier\"; Canal was a \"caporal-chef\". The highest-ranked rider was Julien Gonnet, who was a \"sergent-chef\"."

        "text": "The Princeton Tigers women's basketball team is the intercollegiate women's basketball program representing Princeton University. The school competes in the Ivy League in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Tigers play home basketball games at the Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton, New Jersey on the university campus. Princeton has won sixteen Ivy League championships and will make their ninth appearance in an NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship in the 2022 tournament.\nHighlights.\nThe Tigers first season was the 1971–72 season. They began play with their first ever game being played on February 2, 1972. The 2009–10 team began one of the best overall record streaks in Princeton women's basketball history. Entering the post-season with a 26–2 overall record, the Tigers were one of five teams in the country with two or fewer losses. The other four teams earned No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament. Sweeping the Ivy League with a 14–0 mark, the Tigers earned a No. 12 seed to the NCAA Tournament. In 2011–12, Princeton was the first-ever Ivy League women's team to receive a national ranking. The Tigers moved into the AP Top 25 Poll, earning a No. 24 national ranking in the Week 18 poll. The Tigers won their third consecutive Ivy League Championship that season and earned the No. 9 seed into the NCAA Tournament. In 2012–13, Princeton earned the No. 9 seed, after winning the Ivy League for the fourth consecutive season. Niveen Rasheed earned an Associated Press All-American recognition that season. The 2014–15 team finished the season 31–1, 14–0 to win the Ivy League regular season title to earn an automatic trip to the 2015 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, which they lost to Maryland in the second round. The Tigers' No. 13 ranking in both the Associated Press Top-25 and USA Today Coaches polls are the highest in conference history. Princeton's No. 8 seed is the best an Ivy program has ever earned, and the Tigers' first round win over Green Bay was just the second NCAA victory for an Ivy team, joining No. 16 Harvard's upset over No. 1 Stanford in 1998.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, head coach Courtney Banghart notched her 200th win, all within her Princeton tenure.\nDuring the 2021–22 season, Abby Meyers led Princeton with 17.9 points and 5.8 rebounds per game, as she shot 45.9 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from three-point range. She ranked first in the conference in three-point percentage, effective field goal percentage, true shooting percentage, and player efficiency rating, second in scoring, third in 2-point field goal percentage (15.9%), and eighth in rebounds. She helped lead Princeton to a third consecutive Ivy League championship. Following the season she was named the Ivy League Player of the Year and a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy First Team. She was also named an Associated Press All-American honorable mention, becoming the fourth All-American in program history.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I.\nThe Tigers have made the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament eleven times. They have a record of 3–11.\nAIAW College Division/Division II.\nThe Tigers made one appearance in the AIAW National Division II basketball tournament, with a combined record of 1–1."

        "text": "This is a list of grounds that Kent County Cricket Club have used since the formation of the first county club in August 1842. The club has used 29 grounds for first-class, List A and Twenty20 home matches. Prior to the formation of the first county club an informal county team had appeared in first-class matches from 1773 and cricket had been played in the county from at least the 17th century.\nWhite Hart Field in Bromley played host to the club's first home fixture in first-class cricket against an All England cricket team in 1842. The county was based at the Beverley Ground in Canterbury until 1846 and Canterbury Cricket Week was first established at this ground. From 1847 the base for the county moved to the St Lawrence Ground, also in Canterbury, and this ground was later established as the county's formal headquarters. It is now the main ground for the county and hosts the majority of home matches, although it was typically only used for county cricket during Canterbury week until well into the 20th century. The ground is famous for having had a tree, the St Lawrence Lime, on the playing area for most of its history.\nUnusually for a first-class county, Kent have played over 100 home fixtures at seven grounds and continued to play the majority of its matches away from the St Lawrence Ground until well into the 20th century. The out-grounds still in use as of 2018 are the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells, which hosts the annual Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week, and the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham.\nThe 29 grounds that Kent have used for home matches since 1842 are listed below along with The Oval in London, which is the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club which was used for two home matches by Kent.\nGrounds.\nBelow is a list of grounds used by Kent County Cricket Club in first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Grounds are listed in order of their first use by the county. The count only includes matches where Kent were the home team. Many grounds have been used by other teams, including for international matches.\nThe Oval.\nKent have used The Oval, the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club, for \"home\" matches on two occasions. The quarter-final of the 1981 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup against Warwickshire was scheduled to be played on the St Lawrence Ground but, following heavy rain, the ground was deemed unplayable. Play was impossible on the first two days allocated for the fixture and an inspection on the third day also ruled out play and the match was switched to use The Oval at short notice.\nThe second Kent \"home\" match on the ground was a 2010 Twenty20 Cup fixture against Essex which Kent chose to play on the ground in an attempt to increase attendance and, as a result, income. The experiment was not repeated.\nBibliography.\nMilton H (2020) \"Kent County Cricket Grounds\". Woking: Pitch Publishing. "

        "title": "Byron Jones (American football)",
        "text": "Byron Philip Jones (born September 26, 1992) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the UConn Huskies, and was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft after a stellar combine performance. He holds the unofficial world record for the standing long jump at 12 feet 3 inches (3.73 meters). He played five seasons for the Cowboys, where he was once named Second-team All-Pro and made the Pro Bowl. A free agent after his fifth season, Jones signed a five-year, $82 million contract with the Miami Dolphins, making him the highest-paid cornerback in the NFL at the time.\nEarly years.\nJones attended St. Paul Catholic High School in Bristol, Connecticut and played for Jude Kelly. He was a gifted track &amp; field athlete, and was one of the state's top performers in the 200m and 400m. At the 2010 NVL Outdoor T&amp;F Championships, he earned first-place finishes in both the 200-meter dash (22.13s) and 400-meter dash (48.43s).\nIn football, he received Class MM All-State and All-Naugatuck Valley honors as a senior and team captain. He was considered a two-star recruit by \"Rivals.com\". He also played basketball.\nCollege career.\nJones accepted a scholarship from the University of Connecticut Huskies. As a redshirt freshman, he started 2 games at cornerback and six of the final seven games at safety. He recorded 51 tackles (sixth on the team), one fumble recovery, 2 interceptions and 4 passes defensed. He returned a fumble for a game-winning touchdown against the University of South Florida.\nAs a sophomore, he started 12 games at safety, tallying 88 tackles (third on the team), one interception and 2 passes defensed. The next year, he was switched to cornerback, starting 11-of-12 games, while registering 60 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 interceptions and 8 passes defensed.\nJones started 7 games at cornerback as a senior, posting 24 tackles, 2 interceptions and 4 passes defensed. He had a 70-yard interception return against the University of South Florida in what ESPN announcers called \"what might be the UConn play of the year\". He missed the rest of the season after undergoing surgery for a shoulder injury suffered in a loss against East Carolina University. He finished his college career with 223 total tackles, 8 interceptions and 2 touchdowns.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nPrior to the NFL Scouting Combine, Jones was ranked the 25th best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFL.com. He was one of 54 defensive backs to receive an invitation to the NFL combine. At the NFL combine, he set a new combine and world record for standing broad jump by leaping 12 feet, 3 inches (3.73m), surpassing Jamie Collins's old record of 11 feet, 7 inches (3.53m) set in 2013. He was limited to the bench press, vertical jump, broad jump, short shuttle, and three-cone drill. Jones also finished first of all combine participants in the vertical leap. His combine performance gave him an immediate rise up draft boards and made him a top defensive back prospect.\nOn March 31, 2015, Jones attended UConn's pro day, along with Deshon Foxx, Geremy Davis, B. J. McBryde, and five others. He completed his combine drills and ran positional drills run by Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer. Zimmer was one of the team representatives and scouts from 29 NFL teams who attended his pro day, along with Philadelphia Eagles head coach Chip Kelly. Jones had private workouts and visits with the Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, and San Francisco 49ers. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Jones was projected to be a first round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the third best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com, was ranked the seventh best cornerback by NFL analyst Mike Mayock, and was ranked the seventh best cornerback in the draft by \"Sports Illustrated\".\nDallas Cowboys.\n2015 season.\nThe Dallas Cowboys selected Jones in the first round (27th overall) of the 2015 NFL draft. He was the fourth cornerback selected in 2015. On June 11, 2015, the Cowboys signed Jones to a four-year, $8.60 million contract that included $6.93 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $6.51 million.\nThroughout training camp, Jones competed for a job as a starting cornerback, against Morris Claiborne and Tyler Patmon, after Orlando Scandrick tore his MCL and ACL. Head coach Jason Garrett named Jones the backup cornerback behind Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Cowboys' season-opener against the New York Giants and made his first career tackle on Eli Manning during their 27–26 victory. On October 25, 2015, Jones recorded a season-high seven combined tackles and two pass deflections in the Cowboys' 27–20 loss at the Giants. On November 1, 2015, Jones earned his first career start at free safety in place of J. J. Wilcox. He made three combined tackles and a pass deflection in their 13–12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. In Week 11, Jones earned his first start at cornerback after Morris Claiborne sustained a hamstring injury and missed two consecutive games (Weeks 11–13). He finished the Cowboys' 24–14 victory at the Miami Dolphins with three solo tackles and had difficulties in pass coverage after giving a 47-yard touchdown reception to Jarvis Landry and a 29-yard touchdown reception to Kenny Stills. He finished his rookie season with 67 combined tackles (47 solo) and nine pass deflections in 16 games and 11 starts. Jones started the final ten games of the season, with three starts at safety and four at cornerback and nickelback.\n2016 season.\nJones entered training camp as the favorite to start at free safety and competed with Wilcox. Defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli opted to name him as the starting free safety to start the regular season, alongside strong safety Barry Church.\nIn Week 10, Jones recorded a season-high 12 combined tackles (11 solo) during a 35–30 victory at the Pittsburgh Steelers. On December 18, 2016, he made seven combined tackles, broke up two passes, and recorded his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Jameis Winston in the Cowboys' 26–20 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Jones finished the season with 88 combined tackles (73 solo), ten pass deflections, and an interception in 16 games and 16 starts. Pro Football Focus gave Jones an overall grade of 83.4 in 2016.\nThe Cowboys finished first in the NFC East with a 13–3 record and a first round bye. On January 15, 2017, Jones started his first career playoff game and recorded five solo tackles and deflected two passes in a 34–31 loss at the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional round.\nHe posted 16 starts, 102 tackles (fourth on the team), 10 passes defensed, one forced fumble and his first career interception.\n2017 season.\nJones remained the starting free safety to begin the 2017 regular season, alongside strong safety Jeff Heath. In Week 4, he recorded a season-high seven solo tackles in the Cowboys' 35–30 loss against the Los Angeles Rams. \nOn October 29, 2017, he made five combined tackles, broke up a pass, and returned an interception by Kirk Cousins for a 21-yard touchdown in a 33–19 victory at the Washington Redskins. On December 10, 2017, Jones collected a season-high nine combined tackles during a 30–10 win at the Giants. \nHe finished the season with 16 starts, 74 tackles (4 for loss), five pass deflections, an interception, a touchdown and led the team with 11 special teams tackles. Pro Football Focus gave Jones an overall grade of 76.8, which ranked 54th among all qualifying safeties.\n2018 season.\nIn the offseason, Jones announced that he would be switching from free safety back to cornerback. On April 22, 2018, the Cowboys picked up the fifth-year option on Jones' contract.\nHe started all 16 games, registering 76 tackles (2 for loss) 14 passes defensed (career-high), no interceptions and 2 special teams tackles. He was ranked the fifth-best corner in the league by Pro Football Focus and was elected to his first career Pro Bowl.\n2019 season.\nJones had offseason hip surgery, which caused him to miss the offseason program and training camp. He started 14 of the 15 games in which he appeared at right cornerback. He missed the season finale because of an ankle injury suffered in practice. \nHe posted 45 tackles, 6 passes defensed, one forced fumble and 2 special teams tackles. Although he did not record an interception, he only gave up 3 touchdowns and quarterbacks completed just 53% of their passes directed at him.\nMiami Dolphins.\n2020 season.\nOn March 21, 2020, Jones signed a five-year, $82 million contract with the Dolphins, making him at the time the highest-paid cornerback in the NFL. He was paired up with Xavien Howard, giving the Dolphins the two highest-paid corners in the NFL at the time.\nIn Week 14 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Jones forced a fumble on Mecole Hardman that was recovered by the Dolphins and intercepted a pass thrown by Patrick Mahomes during the 33–27 loss. This was Jones' first interception since the 2017 season.\nIn Week 17 against the Buffalo Bills, Jones recorded his career high second interception of the season off a pass thrown by Josh Allen during the 56–26 loss.\nHe finished with 14 starts at left cornerback, 37 tackles, 2 interceptions, 4 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He was declared inactive in 2 games against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Seattle Seahawks.\n2021 season.\nIn 2021, another Dolphins cornerback, Xavien Howard, held out during the off-season and asked to be traded, because he was no longer the top paid cornerback on the team. On August 8, his contract was restructured in order to keep him on the team. \nJones dealt with a quad injury and an Achilles injury during the season. He was declared inactive for one game against the Atlanta Falcons. He totaled 16 starts at left cornerback, 58 tackles, 10 passes defensed and one forced fumble.\n2022 season.\nOn July 21, 2022, Jones was placed on the reserve/PUP list at the start of training camp, but ultimately missed the entire season while recovering from a left Achilles surgery performed in March.\nOn February 25, 2023, he wrote on Twitter: \"Today I can't run or jump because of my injuries sustained playing this game. DO NOT take the pills they give you. DO NOT take the injections they give you. If you absolutely must, consult an outside doctor to learn the long-term implications\". On March 15, 2023, the Dolphins designated Jones for release after he failed a physical exam, citing salary cap reasons."

The Organizing Committee's goal is to have the best athletes competing at the Games and thus the schedule for the five aquatics disciplines had to be changed to accommodate athletes. The synchronized swimming competition actually was moved to the day before the opening ceremony, diving events began on the day of the opening ceremony (when events are traditionally not held on the day of the ceremony), open water swimming was moved to the first weekend of the games, swimming was reduced to a five-day schedule (down from seven in Guadalajara, Mexico), and water polo competitions began three days before the opening ceremony. All events were scheduled to be completed by July 24, six days before the opening ceremonies of the World Championships, which in itself was moved back a week to accommodate the games. The change in schedule meant that for the first time ever, events were held before the opening ceremony.\nThe 2015 World Archery Championships were scheduled later in July, not to conflict with the games, while the 2015 World Fencing Championships, which would finish the day before the fencing competitions begin, would have events coordinated to allow athletes to compete at both events. Finally, the second round of the 2015 Davis Cup was moved ahead one week not to conflict with the tennis competitions. Tennis competitions also began before the opening ceremony, to allow athletes to compete in both events.\nCalendar.\nIn the following calendar for the 2015 Pan American Games, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport are held. The number in each box represents the number of finals that will be contested on that day.\nDay (–3) – Tuesday 7 July 2015.\nThe first competitions of the Games took place."

Approximately 6,132 athletes from 41 NOCs participated in 364 events in 36 sports and 51 disciplines.\nThe United States led the medal table both in number of gold medals won (103), and in overall medals (265). Behind the United States, Canada was second on the medal table by golds (78), and second by overall medals (219) – their best result ever, while Brazil was third by golds (42), and third by overall medals (141). For first time since 1971, Cuba finished outside top-2, leading to a 4th place.\nHigh jumper Levern Spencer won St. Lucia's first Pan American gold medal.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is based on information provided by the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) and is consistent with PASO convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nIn badminton, boxing, judo, karate, racquetball, squash, taekwondo, table tennis, and wrestling two bronze medals will be awarded for each event. Also in bowling, fencing and squash two bronze medals will be awarded in some events. Therefore, the total number of bronze medals will be greater than the total number of gold or silver medals.\nTwo gold medals, one to the United States and one to Colombia, were awarded for a first-place tie in the men's pommel horse. Two gold medals were also awarded for a first-place tie in the men's coxless pair, one to Chile and one to Argentina. No silver medal was awarded for both events. Two bronze medals were awarded for a third-place tie at the men's K2 200m, one to Brazil and one to Canada.\nEleven NOC's did not win medals: Aruba, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Guyana, Haiti, Nicaragua, Suriname and the Virgin Islands.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The lowest team total was 31, against Railways in 1958–59.\nThe best innings bowling figures were 6 for 35 by William Ghosh. The best match figures were 9 for 48 (5 for 15 and 4 for 33) by Som Prakash in Jammu and Kashmir's inaugural first-class match in January 1960. That match, which Eastern Punjab won by an innings, was the only one in which they dismissed their opponents twice.\nAfter the team disbanded, many of the players joined Southern Punjab or Northern Punjab, which both competed in the Ranji Trophy from 1960 to 1961 and 1967–68.

It features a moorland course, broad ridges, tree clusters, and rock outcroppings. Due to its proximity to the Arctic Circle, it is possible to play golf at Akureyri Golf Club at night under the midnight sun during the summer.\nAkureyri Golf Club was established in 1935. It is Iceland's second-oldest golf club after Reykjavik Golf Club.\nAkureyri Golf Club established its current location at the Jadar farm in 1970. For ten years, the members played a 9-hole course which is now the front nine, designed by Magnus Gudmundsson. In 1980, the second nine holes were added. The second nine holes were developed and implemented by Magnus Gudmundsson and Gunnar Thordarson.\nThe Arctic Open is held at Akureyri Golf Club during the summer solstice. It was first held in 1986. It is a four-day championship event, open to international professional and amateur golfers.\nIn 1997, four men completed the longest daytime round of golf in history by playing 306 holes at Akureyri Golf Club during the summer when it stays light through the night.\nReferences.\nCitations\nSources"

It is situated in the Blythswood Estate, near to the River Cart and the River Clyde.\nHistory.\nThe club was established on 28 September 1894. A group of wealthy businessmen from Renfrew and Govan held a meeting and subsequently leased land from Speirs of Elderslie Estates. The course was opened on 22 October 1894 by Andrew Brown, Provost of Renfrew. It was originally a nine-hole course at Haining Road and was extended by James Braid in 1920 to eighteen holes and a par of 73. This made the course the longest in the West of Scotland at that time. A club house was opened on 20 May 1925.\nA demand for housing in the area led to the club giving up the lease on the land at Haining Road. It was acquired by Ravenstone Securities Ltd, headed by chairman Reo Stakis. As part of the deal Ravenstone would provide 105 acres of land at Blythswood Estate for a new course to be built. On 29 September 1973 the new course at Blythswood was opened by James T Douglas, President of the Scottish Golf Union.\nThe course has played host to several tournaments including the Scottish Amateur Championship in 1984 and 1994. The European Boys Team Championship 1988 and the Sunderland of Scotland Masters 1991 were held at Renfrew. In 2000 and 2004 the course was used for the Scottish Regional Qualifiers for The Open Championship."

        "title": "Premier Boxing Champions",
        "text": "Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) is an ongoing series of televised boxing events and promotion connected to manager Al Haymon.\nPBC was initially promoted as an effort to return boxing to mainstream broadcast and cable television, as opposed to premium channels and pay-per-view. The first \"Premier Boxing Champions\" card was broadcast by NBC on March 7, 2015, and the promotion reached deals with an array of other broadcasters, with brokered cards scheduled across all four of the major television networks in the United States (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC) and their affiliated sports-oriented cable networks (ESPN, CBS Sports Network, FS1, and NBCSN, respectively), as well as on outlets such as Spike and Bounce TV.\nIn parallel with the focus on major cards on broadcast television, the events initially featured a more elaborate in-arena staging than other boxing events, featuring an entrance stage, and a circular marquee and jumbotron suspended above the ring. The telecasts also employed various technologies, including a 360-degree camera rig above the ring, and sensor-equipped gloves and shorts for gathering additional statistics. However, these features were phased out from later events. By 2018, PBC had established long-term deals with Fox Sports and Showtime, with the networks paying traditional rights fees, and holding the rights to produce PBC pay-per-view events.\nAlthough it promotes the media rights of its associated events, PBC is not considered to be a promoter, in compliance with the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act (which forbids a manager from also serving as a promoter). Haymon considers himself an \"adviser\" and manager. Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank both filed lawsuits against Haymon and the investors of \"PBC\", arguing that through \"PBC\" and other internal intricacies, Haymon was serving as both a manager and promoter—actions which are forbidden under the Ali Act. Additionally, the two promoters claimed violations of antitrust law, with Top Rank in particular claiming that Haymon was trying to effectively monopolize professional boxing in the United States by consolidating boxers with overpaid contracts, venue bookings, the events themselves, and broadcast rights under his ownership. Top Rank settled its suit in May 2016, while the Golden Boy suit was dismissed in 2017 after a judge ruled that it had \"failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact\".\nProduction.\n\"Premier Boxing Champions\" was part of an effort by Al Haymon—best known as the representative of Floyd Mayweather Jr.—to bring mainstream prominence back to the sport of boxing. In the United States, although popular among a niche audience, most major boxing events were relegated to premium television channels (such as HBO and Showtime) and pay-per-view, limiting their mainstream exposure to those who are willing to pay. The growing popularity of mixed martial arts has also affected the popularity of boxing within the young adult demographic; the UFC's broadcast rights contract with Fox allowed some of its cards to air on the main Fox network—which proved successful in terms of overall viewership. In a survey conducted by Haymon, only 2% of the 35% of viewers who identified themselves as fans of boxing had watched it.\n\"PBC\"s chief operations officer Ryan Caldwell acknowledged that when broadly distributed, major sporting events can attract a large number of live viewers as event television, and in turn, advertisers: he explained that they were \"whacking our key demographic with a lot of fees on premium cable and pay-per-view. Broader distribution is key. When you look across other sports, there's a reason they aren't pay-per-view distributed.\" Caldwell also noted the success of WWE Network, which similarly subverted the professional wrestling promotion's traditionally PPV-oriented business model by offering its premium events and other archive programs as part of an over-the-top subscription service. \"PBC\"s vice president of operations Lamont Jones explained that the goal of the promotion was to build loyalty, believing that \"the [same] way the customer goes to the grocery store and sees USDA on the steak and wants to buy it, we want the boxing fan to see to PBC on the telecast and know they can expect high-quality, competitive match-ups.\"\nExecutive producer Michael Marto felt that the in-arena experience of boxing events had been compromised by the focus on their television broadcasts, leading to a lack of \"entertainment\" for those attending in person. A concert-style stage setup known as the \"Ring of Honor\" was therefore developed for PBC events; inspired by the Colosseum and the stage setup of U2's \"360° Tour\", its centerpiece was a Jumbotron-like rig above the ring with an ultra high definition scoreboard screen and a circular marquee display. The screens were used as a scoreboard, and to play instant replays and other features. At the end of the arena was an entry stage known as the \"Wall of Thunder\". There were three different configurations of the stage components for different venue sizes. Film composer Hans Zimmer was commissioned to create theme and soundtrack music for the events.\nNew technologies were also developed for use during \"PBC\" events to provide improved insight and second screen experiences to viewers; Aqueti developed camera technology for use during the events, such as a headband-mounted camera for the referee, \"Round-a-Bout\"—a circular frame with 36 cameras to provide a 360-degree view of the ring below and \"bullet time\" effects, and 250-megapixel \"microcameras\" consisting of multiple digital camera processors linked together. Gloves and shorts were equipped with sensors for measuring the force of punches and other medical data respectively.\nBroadcasting.\nHistory.\n2015–2018.\nAs opposed to most major boxing events, Haymon sought carriage for the \"Premier Boxing Champions\" cards on mainstream cable networks, and on the United States' major television networks. Haymon reached multi-year deals with NBC Sports (NBC and NBCSN), Viacom (Spike), CBS Sports (CBS, CBS Sports Network) and Bounce TV to air \"PBC\" cards through their outlets on either weekend afternoons or in prime time; rather than having the broadcasters pay the promotion a rights fee, the telecasts are brokered by Haymon to the networks in exchange for a cut of advertising revenue. Prior to these deals, boxing telecasts on the major networks in recent years had been limited to occasional one-off broadcasts, such as a broadcast by CBS in December 2012 in conjunction with sister premium network Showtime. All PBC broadcasters entered into exclusivity agreements with the group. CBS's contract contained an option for Showtime to carry PBC cards non-exclusively.\n\"PBC\" cards on Spike were first broadcast as part of the network's combat sports brand \"Friday Night Lights Out\". Antonio Tarver, who served as a member of Spike's broadcast team, explained that \"I remember back in the day when fighters started their careers on NBC. Network TV. That's how legendary stars were made. I think NBC and Spike are going to do the same for today's fighters.\"\nUnder its contract with NBC, Haymon paid the broadcaster $20 million per year; NBC Sports' first 20 \"Premier Boxing Champions\" events included nine prime time cards on NBCSN, and five prime time cards on the NBC network—marking the first time in thirty years that NBC had broadcast a boxing event in prime time. The first \"PBC\" card aired on March 7, 2015, on NBC, and featured Keith Thurman in a welterweight bout against Robert Guerrero, and Adrien Broner against John Molina in a junior welterweight bout. Al Michaels served as the host, joined by Marv Albert and Sugar Ray Leonard as commentators. Viewership of the premiere broadcast peaked at 4.2 million viewers; NBC claimed that it was the most-watched professional boxing telecast since Fox's March 1998 \"Oscar De La Hoya's Fight Night\" (which reached 5.9 million viewers).\nOn March 19, 2015, ESPN announced a two-year deal with \"Premier Boxing Champions\", in which the network would air 12 cards per year, with eleven prime time cards on ESPN and in Spanish on ESPN Deportes (airing under its \"Noche de Combates\" brand), and an afternoon event on ABC. ESPN's inaugural telecast aired on July 11, 2015. Concurrently, ESPN announced that after a seventeen-year run, it would end ESPN2's boxing series \"Friday Night Fights\"; its on-air staff of Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas were carried over to ESPN's \"PBC\" telecasts. On August 4, 2015, Fox Sports 1 announced that it would air 21 \"PBC\" cards on Tuesday nights (\"Toe-to-Toe Tuesdays\") on the network from September 8, 2015, through June 2016. The telecasts were also simulcast in Spanish by Fox Deportes. The announcement came following the end of a contract between Fox Sports and Golden Boy Promotions.\nOn April 7, 2015, \"PBC\" announced a deal with SiriusXM to broadcast several of its cards on satellite radio via its Sports Zone channel.\nOn January 20, 2016, the \"PBC\" broadcast featuring headliners Danny García and Robert Guerrero was the first to be broadcast live in virtual reality by Fox Sports and NextVR.\nOn June 25, 2016, CBS broadcast its first primetime \"PBC\" card, featuring a WBA welterweight championship fight between Keith Thurman and Shawn Porter (won by unanimous decision by Thurman to retain his title), which marked the first boxing event broadcast by CBS in primetime since 1978. The telecast was produced by Showtime as a special edition of \"Showtime Championship Boxing\".\n2018–present.\nBy 2018, most of PBC's broadcasting agreements lapsed. In September of that year, PBC reached a four-year deal with Fox Sports, covering a series of 10 \"marquee\" cards per-year on the Fox broadcast network, 12 per-year on FS1, as well as Fox-produced pay-per-view events. Unlike the previous time-buy arrangements, Fox is paying rights fees; \"The Ring\" reported that Fox was paying $60 million per-year. Prior to the announcement, PBC reached a long-term deal with Showtime, through 2021. Despite PBC's previous aversion to them, Fox and Showtime would also began producing pay-per-view events as part of their respective deals.\nIn June 2019, Mike Coppinger of \"The Athletic\" reported that Ari Emanuel, co-CEO of Endeavor (parent company of UFC), had been in talks with Haymon to potentially acquire PBC, with Haymon maintaining his involvement (as Dana White had after its acquisition of UFC).\nOn December 7, 2023, with Showtime winding down its sports division, PBC announced an exclusive agreement with Amazon Prime Video. Amazon will stream a regular \"PBC Championship Boxing\" series in the United States and other countries on Prime Video, as well as ancillary content such as original documentaries and archive content. In the United States, Amazon will also distribute PBC pay-per-view events; they will not require an Amazon Prime subscription to purchase.\nUnited States audiences.\n, the highest PBC audiences have been Errol Spence Jr. vs Leonard Bundu (NBC, 2016, 4.8 million), Keith Thurman vs Robert Guerrero (NBC, 2015, 3.4 million), and Keith Thurman vs Danny García (CBS, 2017, 3.1 million), all of them at welterweight division.\nReception.\nIn its review of the inaugural \"Premier Boxing Champions\" event on NBC, \"Bad Left Hook\" praised the event's on-air production style for feeling more like a \"modern\", \"true mainstream sports show\" than the boxing events of HBO and Showtime, along with the performance of Al Michaels, Steve Smoger, and BJ Flores. The performance of Marv Albert was panned, noting that he \"[missed] a lot of the action\", along with Steve Farhood's lack of contributions beyond scoring the fights. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was also criticized for being \"generic\" and \"[robbing] fighters of their own personalities.\" \"Bleacher Report\" was similarly mixed, describing the atmosphere as being too \"sterile\" for a sport that \"thrives on chaos\", and that \"the bland short walks to the ring and generic music presenting the fighters as interchangeable automatons [are] more NFL than WWE\". NBC's on-air talent also received mixed reviews, especially the poor performance of Albert, explaining that \"Albert, who hasn't called boxing since 1985, sounded like a guy who hadn't called boxing in 30 years. He had a hard time keeping up with the action, eventually giving up on play-by-play and occasionally adding a booming 'Yes!' whenever a particularly telling blow landed.\"\n\"Bloody Elbow\" noted that PBC's initial ambitions \"largely failed in the short-term; poor ratings, inactive fighters, questionable matchmaking, and planned event dates falling through (among other things) led to genuine concern that they would falter by the end of 2016.\" In September 2016, ESPN writer Dan Rafael observed that PBC's events had been diminishing in scale (presumed to be the result of dwindling funding), with lower-profile fights at smaller venues (as opposed to the higher-profile main events at major arenas), dropping the staging and production elements that were associated with the early events, and a lower saturation of events overall than there were at the onset (although noting that they were also likely trying to avoid competition with football season).\nControversy.\nOn May 6, 2015, Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions filed a $300 million lawsuit against Al Haymon and the financiers of Premier Boxing Champions, alleging a violation of antitrust laws and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act. Golden Boy alleged that Haymon had violated the act's requirement that managers not serve as promoters, stating that he had \"forbidden hundreds of boxers he manages to sign with any other promoter; and he has acted to cut off legitimate promoters not only from promoting boxers he manages, but also from essential network television of boxing matches and from the quality arenas necessary for the effective presentation of their bouts. His illegal conduct, designed to eliminate all competition, also constitutes an 'unlawful ... business act or practice' constituting 'unfair competition' under California Business and Professions Code.\"\nOn July 1, 2015, Top Rank filed a similar lawsuit against Haymon and \"Premier Boxing Champions\" investor Waddell &amp; Reed, seeking an injunction to cease the events and $100 million in damages. Top Rank alleged violations of the Ali act and antitrust laws, arguing that Haymon was attempting to monopolize boxing through internal practices such as using \"sham\" promoters that are ultimately connected to Haymon, attempting to prevent major venues from being booked by competing promoters by reserving them for a different event, but cancelling and moving the event elsewhere after a competing event is forced to re-locate, and entering into exclusivity agreements with broadcasters through \"Premier Boxing Champions\" to prevent them from broadcasting competing events. Top Rank alleged that \"with the financial backing, complicity, and material assistance of Waddell &amp; Reed and other financiers, Haymon is rigging the boxing industry so they can act as manager, promoter, sponsor, and ticket broker for nearly every major professional boxer competing in the United States\". An attorney representing Haymon denied the lawsuit, claiming it was \"entirely without merit and is a cynical attempt by boxing’s old guard to use the courts to undermine the accessibility, credibility and exposure of boxing that the sport so desperately needs.\"\nThe Top Rank lawsuit was dismissed in October 2015, with the court ruling that the promoter had failed to provide specific examples of the conduct that it had alleged, nor evidence that the alleged actions harmed Top Rank, but in the decision federal judge John F. Walter allowed Top Rank to file an amended complaint after removing Premier Boxing Champion financier Waddell and Reed, which Top Rank did. After receiving the amended complaint, Judge Walter allowed the case to continue and ruled against Haymon's motion to dismiss on January 6, 2016. Top Rank and Haymon agreed to a settlement in May 2016; it was reported that the settlement also contained an option to explore the possibility of a Mayweather/Pacquiao rematch, although this was not confirmed.\nPre-trial documents of the Golden Boy lawsuit revealed that PBC's contract with NBC Sports called for Haymon to pay the broadcaster per-broadcast at intervals (with NBC being required to contribute $150,000 to cover a portion of the production costs for each telecast). It was also established that while PBC would produce the telecast, actual promotion of the event was to be contracted by Haymon to a \"duly licensed\" promoter. It was also revealed that the exclusivity clauses associated with the PBC television contracts had been waived in May 2016. In January 2017, the Golden Boy lawsuit was dismissed, with the court ruling that the promoter had \"failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to any of their federal claims for relief\".\nAwards.\nSince its inception, \"Premier Boxing Champions\" has given out end-of-year awards for various categories:"

        "title": "Rules of water polo",
        "text": "The rules of water polo are the rules and regulations which cover the play, procedure, equipment and officiating of water polo. These rules are similar throughout the world, although slight variations do occur regionally and depending on the governing body. Governing bodies of water polo include FINA, the international governing organization for the rules; the NCAA, which govern the rules for collegiate matches in the United States; the NFHS, which govern the rules in high schools in the USA; and the IOC, which govern the rules at Olympic events.\nCore rules.\nNumber of players.\nSenior games consist of seven players from each team (six field players and a goalkeeper) that are allowed in the playing area of the pool during gameplay. FINA reduced the number of players in U20 (and younger) competitions that they sanction to six (5 field players and a goalkeeper) in 2014. If a player commits an exclusion (major) foul, then that team will play with one player fewer until the player is allowed to re-enter (typically 20 seconds). If a player commits a particularly violent act, such as striking a player, then the referee may signal a brutality foul, in which case that team is required to play with one fewer player in the water for 4 minutes, besides the culprit being ejected [\ni.e. they must leave the pool area and not return]. Plus, the culprit may not be allowed to compete in a given number of future games depending on the governing body.\nPlayers may be substituted in and out after goals, during timeouts, between quarters, and after injuries. During game play, players enter and exit in the corner of the pool (called the re-entry area), or in front of their goal. When play is stopped, they may enter or exit anywhere.\nIf at any time during play a team has more players in the pool than they are allowed, a penalty is given to the opposing team. If a team starts with less than six outfield players, the referee may yellow card the coach for allowing it to happen and give a major foul to the opposition on 6 metres, if the 6th player then joins the game illegally.\nA variation is Beach water polo, which has four players including the goal keeper, and a smaller field, and some other differing rules.\nCaps.\nThe two opposing teams must wear caps which contrast:\nIn practice, one team usually wears dark caps and the other white (usually white for the home team, and dark for the away team for FINA). Teams may choose to wear different cap colors (e.g. their team colors). For instance, Australia's women's water polo team wears green caps.\nFor NFHS, CWPA, and NCAA rules (United States) the home team is dark and the away team is white.\nThe water polo cap is used to protect the players' heads and ears, and the numbers on them (1-13) make them identifiable from afar, especially by the referee(s). Both goalies wear red or red striped caps. The first choice goalkeeper is usually marked \"1\" with the reserve being marked \"13\" (under FINA rules) or \"1A\" (under NCAA and NFHS rules).\nDuration of the game.\nThe game is divided into four periods; the length depends on the level of play. There is no overtime nor ties in international water polo, and games proceed to a shootout if a victor is required. At the collegiate level there are two straight 3-minute periods; and if still tied, multiple 3-minute golden goal overtime periods thereafter. Lower levels of play have different overtime rules depending on the organization.\nA two-minute break follows every period (including overtime/shootout), but there's also a 5-minute halftime intermission.\nGame and shot clock.\nThe game clock is stopped when the ball is not in play (between a foul being committed and the free throw being taken, and between a goal being scored and the restart). As a result, the average quarter lasts around 12 minutes of real time. A team may not have possession of the ball for longer than 30 seconds without shooting for the goal unless an opponent commits an ejection foul. After 30 seconds, possession passes to the other team, and the shot-clock is reset. The clock is also reset for 30 seconds after a goal or neutral throw, or penalty in which possession is exchanged.\nHowever, if a team shoots the ball within the allotted time, and regains control of the ball (e.g. after a rebound from the goal post), the shot clock is reset to 20 seconds. It is also reset for 20 seconds after a major (exclusion) foul, corner throw, or rebound from a penalty throw if the attacking team retain possession.\nPool dimensions.\nDimensions of the water polo pool are not fixed and can vary between 20×10 and 30×20 meters (FINA approved matches require a 30x20 meter pool for men, and 25x20 meter pool for women), therefore short course pools can be used. Minimum water depth must be least 1.8 meters (6 feet), but this is often not the case due to nature of the pool (as many have shallow ends). The goals are wide &amp; high.\nThe middle of the pool is designated by a white line. Before 2005, the pool was divided by 7 and 4 meter lines (distance out from the goal line). This has been merged into one 5 meter line since the 2005–2006 season, and '6 meter' line since the 2019–2020 season. The 6 meter line is marked by a yellow line. It was brought in by FINA in 2019, and relates to the method of taking a free throw after an ordinary or exclusion foul. The '5 meter' line is where penalties are shot and it is designated by a yellow line. The '2 meter' line is designated with a red line; and no player of the attacking team can receive a ball inside this zone. Those are being used since the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021.\nWater polo balls are generally yellow and of varying size and weight for juniors, women and men.\nIn a game, if the ball goes out of the playing area (or hits the edge of the pool then falls back in to the water), a free throw is given to the team that did not touch the ball last before it went out of play.\nAlso, the referee should not pick up the ball when it is at the side of the pool during a break in play, and hand it to the attacking team - as this can lead to an advantage to that team.\nGameplay.\nBeginning of play.\nIn an all-deep water pool, the home team starts on the left side (looking across the pool from the scoring table). The teams change ends at halftime. In a pool with a shallow end, there is a toss of a coin to decide which team starts on which side. The teams change ends at the end of two quarters.\nAt the start of each period and after every score, teams line up on their own goal line. The most common formation is for three players to go to each side of the goal, while the goalkeeper stays in the goal. If the ball is to be thrown into the pool's center, the sprinter will often start in the goal, while the goalkeeper begins either in the goal as well, or to one side of the goal.\nAt the referee's whistle, both teams swim to midpoint of the field (known as the 'sprint' or the 'swim-off') as the referee drops the ball on to the water. Depending on the rules being played, this is either on the referee's side of the pool or in the center. In international competitions the ball is normally placed in the middle of the pool and is supported with a floating ring. The first team to recover the ball becomes the attacker until a goal is scored or the defenders recover the ball.\nExceptionally, a foul may be given before either team reaches the ball. This usually occurs when a player uses the side to assist themselves gain a speed advantage (i.e. by pulling on the side to move faster). The non-offending team receives a free throw from the halfway line in such scenarios.\nThe swim-off occurs only at the start of periods &amp; after scores. There 4 swim-offs in a game, as the game is divided into 4 quarters of 8-minutes each.\nThe referee(s) should check the players' nails before the start of play (to prevent scratching). Goggles and jewelry are not normally allowed.\nMoving the ball.\nPlayers can move the ball by throwing it to a teammate or swimming with the ball in front of them. Players are not permitted to push the ball underwater in order to keep it from an opponent, or push or hold an opposing player unless that player is holding the ball. If a player does push the ball underwater when it is in their possession, this is called 'ball under' and will result in a 'turnover' which means the offending player has to hand the ball over to the other team. It does not matter if the player holding the ball underwater is forced to do so by an opponent. The foul is still given against them.\nWater polo is an intensely aggressive sport, so fouls are very common and result in a free throw during which the player cannot shoot at the goal unless outside the 6 meter line. If a foul is called outside the 6 meter line, the player may either shoot (in one movement, ie without faking), pass or continue swimming with the ball.\nScoring.\nA goal is scored if the ball completely passes between the goal posts and is underneath the crossbar. If a shot bounces off a goal post back into the field of play, and the ball is regained by the attacking team, the shot clock is reset (to 20 seconds), and play continues. If the shot goes outside the goal and touches the rope, or onto the deck (outside the field of play), a goal throw (to the defence) occurs, and the clock is reset (to 30 seconds). This has to be taken without delay (time limit not specified in rules). If the goalie, however, is the last to touch the ball before it goes out of play behind the goal line, or if a defender purposely sends the ball out, then the offense receives the ball for a 'corner throw' on the two meter line. From a corner, which also has to be taken without delay (again time limit not specified in the rules), the player can swim with the ball, shoot at goal or pass. Goals are also scored if shots are taken before shot clock hits 0 and/or game clock hits 00.0, provided the ball is free from the player's hands.\nWhen the goalie blocks a shot, the defense may gain control of the ball, and make a long pass to a teammate who stayed on his offensive end of the pool when the rest of his team was defending. This is called \"cherry-picking\" or \"seagulling\". This can occur as there is no offside rule in water polo, unlike football (soccer). So a defending player can 'hang around' the opposition's goal.\nThe 'own goal' concept also does not exist in water polo like football (soccer). But they do occur (rarely) and then the goal is awarded to the attacking player that last touched the ball.\nRestart after a goal.\nAfter a goal is scored, the teams may line up anywhere within their own half of the pool. In practice, this is usually near the center of the pool. Play resumes when the referee signals for play to restart and the team not scoring the goal puts the ball in to play by passing it backwards to a teammate.\nTimeouts.\nEach team may call a variable (according to the rules being used) number of one 1-minute timeouts (USA/FINA) or 2-minute timeouts (NCAA/NFHS); and one timeout if the game goes into overtime/shootout. During game play, only the team in possession of the ball may call a timeout. Timeouts don't carry over to overtime/shootout. The penalty for calling a timeout during play without possession of the ball is a penalty foul going against the team.\nFINA Water polo rules allow for two timeouts for each team in a match. They can be taken in the same period.\nNCAA and NFHS rules allow for three timeouts during regulation play. If the game goes into overtime, each team is allowed one timeout for the duration of overtime.\nThree short whistles are blown by the referee at 45 seconds (after a prompt from the scorers on the scoring table) during the timeout, and he/she waves the attacking players forward into the opponents’ half. At 60 seconds, the ball is thrown to the goalkeeper (usually) on the halfway line, who can play the ball when another (single) long whistle is blown.\nSubstitutions.\nA substitute can enter the pool from any place during the intervals between quarters, after a goal has been scored, during a timeout and to replace an injured player; but not after a penalty. If a substitution is made during play, the head of the player leaving should be visible in the re-entry area, before the player entering the pool can go under the rope. Neither can lift the rope.\nControl over conduct.\nWater polo referees utilize red and yellow cards when handling bench conduct. A verbal warning may be issued depending on the severity of the infraction.\nA yellow card may be issued at any point in the game and can be issued via a \"walking yellow\" in which the referee pulls a yellow card out without stopping live play. Following the issuance of a \"walking yellow\", at the next stoppage of play, the referee may pull the ball out to inform the table and partner referee of the issuance of that card.\nA red card can be issued to any team personnel (head and assistant coaches, team managers, players, and other officials with the team) or supporters. Following the issuance of a red card, the individual must leave the pool area, and have no further contact with the game (by any method). Red cards carry at least a one-game suspension for the offender with a report being filed to the appropriate governing authority. A red card is also given to players acquiring their second yellow card.\nFouls.\nOrdinary fouls.\nOrdinary fouls occur when a player impedes or otherwise prevents the free movement of an opponent who is not holding the ball, but has it in or near their possession. The most common is when a player reaches over the shoulder of an opponent in order to knock the ball away while in the process hindering the opponent. Offensive players may be called for a foul by pushing off a defender to provide space for a pass or shot.\nThe referee indicates the foul with one short whistle blow and points one hand in the direction of the attacking team (standing roughly in line with the position of the foul), who retain possession. The attacker must make a free pass without undue delay (time period not specified in the rules) to another offensive player. If the foul has been committed outside the 6 meter line, the offensive player can attempt a direct shot on goal, but the shot must be taken immediately and in one continuous motion (i.e., with no faking). If the offensive player fakes a shot and then shoots the ball, it is a turnover.\nThe defender (usually the one that has conceded the foul) has to back off (a distance not specified in the rules, but usually taken to be 1.5–2 meters) to allow the free throw to be taken. In other words, they cannot simply hold their ground to block the offensive player. The defender, at a reasonable distance, can raise their arm to compete at the free throw. The throw (and all throws after infringements) has to be taken without delay. The maximum time period for this (also not stated in the rules) is usually taken to be about 3 seconds.\nIf the same defender repeatedly makes minor fouls, referees will exclude that player for 30 seconds. To avoid an ejection, the \"hole\" (centre) defender may foul twice, and then have a wing defender switch with him so that the defense can continue to foul the \"hole man\" (centre forward) without provoking an exclusion foul. The rule was altered to allow repeated fouls without exclusions, but is often still enforced by referees.\nThere are quite a few other infringements that lead to an ordinary foul, including standing if there is a shallow end, delaying taking a throw (free, goal or corner), taking a penalty throw incorrectly, touching the ball with two hands (if not the goalkeeper), simulating being fouled, time-wasting, and being within two metres of the goal.\nMajor fouls.\nMajor fouls (exclusion and penalty fouls) are committed when the defensive player \"holds (especially with two hands), sinks or pulls back\" (a key phrase in water polo) the offensive player. This includes swimming on the other player's legs or back, stopping the other player from swimming, or otherwise preventing the offensive player from preserving his advantage.\nA referee signals a major foul by two short whistle bursts, then a long burst, and indicates that the player must leave the field of play and move to the penalty area for twenty seconds. The referee will first point to the player who commits the foul and will blow the whistle, then they will point to the ejection corner and blow the whistle again. The player must move to their re-entry area without impacting the natural game play and in reasonable time (or a penalty is given). A player that has been ejected thrice must sit out the rest of the match.\nThere are several other infringements that can lead to an exclusion foul:\nA brutality foul is called when a player kicks or strikes an opponent or official with malicious intent. The strike must make contact with the player for a brutality to be called, and must be with intent to injure. Otherwise the player is punished with a misconduct foul, with substitution allowed after 20 seconds or a change of possession. The player who is charged with a brutality is red-carded; that team plays shorthanded for 4 minutes, and is forced to play with one fewer player than the other team for that duration. In addition to the exclusion, a penalty shot is also awarded to the opposing team if the foul occurs during actual play. Previously, the team who was charged with a brutality would be required to play the remainder of the game with one fewer player. All brutalities have to be reported by officials and further actions may be taken by the relevant governing body. These actions could include more games added onto the one-game suspension.\nA flagrant misconduct foul is the NFHS/ NCAA wording of FINA's brutality. Following the issuance of a flagrant misconduct foul the player is given a red card. The penalty for a flagrant misconduct is a penalty shot followed by a 6–on-5, regardless of the team scoring off the penalty throw. Like a brutality foul, officials must report to their relevant governing body.\nA misconduct foul is an unsportsmanlike act; these include unacceptable language, violence or persistent fouls, taking part in the game after being excluded, or showing disrespect. The player is red-carded with substitution after 20 seconds has elapsed. There are two kinds of misconduct fouls that a player can incur. If the incident does not involve physical (or attempted) contact, the referee can impose a Misconduct charge.\nFive meter penalty.\nIf a defender commits a major foul within the six meter area that prevents a likely goal, the attacking team is awarded a penalty throw or shot. This is usually when the attacking player is impeded in taking a shot at goal, from behind or the side. According to the FINA rule changes in 2019, the referee no longer has any discretion in awarding a penalty (e.g., taking into account whether a goal was likely or not).\nAn attacking player lines up on the five meter line in front of the opposing goal. No other player may be in front of him or within 2 meters of his position. The defending goalkeeper must be between the goal posts. The referee signals with a whistle and by lowering his arm, and the player taking the penalty shot must immediately throw the ball with an uninterrupted motion toward the goal (i.e., without pumping or faking). The shooter's body can not at any time cross the 5 meter line until after the ball is released. If the shooter carries his body over the line and shoots the result is a turn over. If the shot does not score and the ball stays in play then play continues. Penalty shots are often successful, with 63.7% of shots being scored from them.\nThere are quite a few other infringements that can lead to a penalty: a player that has been excluded interfering with the game as they exit the pool, an excluded player entering the pool without a signal from the referee (or scoring table), a player or substitute exiting or entering the pool incorrectly (during game time, e.g., lifting the rope), a brutality foul, a coach or captain requesting a time out when not in possession of the ball, and a coach delaying the return of the ball.\nOvertime.\nFINA.\nIf the score is tied at the end of regulation play, a penalty shootout will determine the winner. Five players and a goalkeeper are chosen by the coaches of each team. A player cannot be chosen if s/he is ineligible to play from receiving (i.e. 3 personal fouls or red carded). Players shoot from the 5 meter line alternately at either end of the pool in turn until all five have taken a shot. If the score is still tied, the same players shoot alternately until one team misses and the other scores.\nNCAA.\nDiffering from FINA rules which require shootouts, NCAA rules require teams to play two three-minute overtime periods, and if still tied play additional three-minute sudden death periods until a team scores a goal and wins the game.\nNFHS.\nAmerican high school water polo plays overtime as two 3 minute periods followed by multiple 3-minute sudden death periods if the tie persists after the 2 periods of play.\nTournament hosts can modify their rules to incorporate regulation, such as sudden death immediately following 4 periods of the game, or a shoot-out.\nOfficials.\nThe game of water polo requires numerous officials. The four main categories are: referee, secretary, timekeeper and goal judge. These can again be qualified into two broader categories: game officials and table officials.\nGame officials.\nBecause water polo is a fast, high scoring game, several officials are required: (ideally) two referees, a secretary, two game/shot clock operator(s), and two goal judges. For many lower level games one referee and two people on the scoring table is sufficient. Game officials are broadly responsible for ensuring the game runs smoothly and that correct and fair decisions relating to the game are made.\nReferee.\nThe referees have ultimate power over decisions relating to the game, even (if necessary) overruling decisions from goal judges, secretaries or timekeepers. They have the responsibility of signalling fouls (ordinary, exclusion, misconduct and brutality), goals, penalties, timeouts, start of play, end of play (to an extent), restart of play, neutral, corner and goal throws. The referee must attempt to keep to all of the rules of water polo to the governing body they are using.\nThere are always one or two referees in a game of water polo. At a higher level, two referees are virtually always used; but at lower levels, if there are limited available referees, a referee may officiate the game without another. When goal judges are not present or available, the referee(s) may take their place in that they have the decision as to whether the ball has crossed the line etc.\nReferees have a variety of methods for signalling fouls, most of which are done by hand and with the aid of a whistle. The purpose of these signals are to inform players, coaches, spectators and other officials of the decision being made, with sometimes information as to why the decision has been awarded. They have the power to remove anyone from the pool area (for Misconduct), including coaches and spectators.\nReferees have dress codes at higher (and sometimes lower) levels of water polo, and are expected to abide by this. Often, the dress code is all white, but some associations deviate this slightly.\nGoal judge.\nDepending on the availability of officials goal judges may or may not be used. Goal judges are often seen at high level competition.\nThe goal judges are responsible for several parts of the game. These include: signalling when a goal is scored, signalling corner throws, improper re-entry (after an exclusion), to signal when play can start (at the beginning of quarters) and to signal improper restart at the beginning of quarters.\nThe goal judge is situated (normally sat) perfectly in line with the goal line - one at either end and usually on opposite sides. They remain seated throughout the game.\nTable officials.\nThe table officials in water polo are the timekeeper(s) and the secretary/secretaries. They are overall responsible for the timings of the game and keeping correct information regarding the events of the game, as well as informing of the players of very specific information (notably to do with personal fouls).\nTimekeeper.\nThe timekeeper (or timekeepers) have varying responsibilities depending on the equipment available. Only one is required if no 30 second clock is being used, with two being required otherwise (shot clocks are supposed to be used, but sometimes due to unavailability games are played without them). In higher level matches sometimes there are more than two timekeepers used.\nOften (though not always) one timekeeper is responsible for running the shot clock. This means that he or she resets it when necessary. When this is the case, the other timekeeper is often responsible for the game clock and score. If an electronic scoreboard and game clock is being used, the timekeeper will update the score when necessary, and has a similar job with the game clock. If not, then the timekeeper will manually time the periods with a stopwatch (or similar device) and alert the players when the period is over with a whistle. If an electronic scoreboard is used, a synthetically produced sound is often produced at the end of periods to alert other officials and players of the end of the period.\nTimekeepers are essentially responsible for keeping record of: the current score (though this is done more officially by the secretary), the 30 second clock, the length of the quarters (at the end of each quarter they indicate this with a whistle blow if this is not done synthetically), the time of exclusion (and when re-entry is thus allowed), the length of timeouts, the length of time between periods and to signal (if not done synthetically) by whistle 30 seconds before the end of quarter or half time and 15 seconds before the end of a timeout. Timekeepers are also responsible for the last minute bell: a bell (or other device - can be audible) showing one minute remaining before full-time.\nSecretary.\nThe secretary (or secretaries) are responsible for keeping written accounts of notable events in the match, and at what point in the match they occur. Where necessary, the player (or players) involved in an event have their hat number and colour noted next to the event including:\nThe secretary is also responsible for keeping a record of how many personal fouls each player has. If a player receives three personal fouls, the secretary is required to hold up the red flag as indication of the player's banishment from the remainder of the match. Should the third personal foul be a penalty foul, then the red flag should be raised and a whistle sounded by the secretary simultaneously."

        "text": "Jim Wood (born July 27, 1936) is an American former gridiron football player and coach. He played college football at the end position at Oklahoma State University from 1956 to 1958. He was selected by the American Football Coaches Association as a first-team end on its 1958 College Football All-America Team, and as a third-team player by the Associated Press. At the end of the 1958 season, an experiment was conducted in which data from 145 football coaches was input into a Univac computer to determine who was the best college football player in the country. The computer ranked Wood as the nation's second best player behind George Deiderich of Vanderbilt. Wood capped his collegiate career by leading Oklahoma State to a 15–6 victory over Florida State in the 1958 Bluegrass Bowl.\nWood later coached at the collegiate and professional levels, including a five-year stint as the head coach at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico from 1968 to 1972. He was the head coach for the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) from 1973 to 1975."

The Crest Tunnel, at is the longest tunnel in Arkansas, and is its only curved tunnel. Both tunnels were built by the White River Division of the Missouri Pacific Railroad in the early 20th century. The tunnels were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.\nCricket Tunnel.\nThe Cricket Tunnel is oriented roughly northwest to southeast, and passes under Old United States Route 65 south of Omaha. It is long, with a concrete-finished northwestern portal from which retaining walls extend, topped by a projecting cornice. The southeast portal is unfinished, as its opening was excavated out of bedrock. Much of the interior of the tunnel is lined with steel and concrete, as it passes through an area of mud and watery clay.\nBoth tunnels were built at the same time in 1903-05 by crews of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Construction of the Cricket Tunnel took longer than anticipated due to the clay encountered, and by a rockslide in the tunnel in September 1904. The concrete lining was added to the tunnel in 1906 amid concerns of continuing rockfalls, and additional work in 1916 removed the top from the southern of the tunnel.\nCrest Tunnel.\nThe Crest Tunnel also runs in a northwest-to-southeast direction, and is located northwest of Omaha, passing under Arkansas Highway 14 east of its junction with US 65. Its northwest portal is unfinished. The tunnel is, at in length, the longest in the state. It is also distinctive for a curve near the southwestern portal. It is bored entirely through bedrock."

        "title": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club grounds",
        "text": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, representing the historic county of Gloucestershire, is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship. The club was established in 1846 following the merger of the Mangotsfield Cricket Club and West Gloucestershire Cricket Club and played under the latter name until 1867, after which it became the Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. It has played first-class cricket since 1870, List A cricket since 1963 and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" away from the club's main headquarters has diminished since the 1980s. Gloucestershire have played home matches at eighteen different grounds.\nThe club's first home match in first-class cricket was played at Durdham Down in the Clifton district of Bristol. This was the only time the county used this venue for a match. The following year Gloucestershire began to play matches at the Clifton College Close Ground in the grounds of Clifton College in the same part of the city, and this remained a regular venue for the county until the 1930s, hosting nearly 100 first-class matches. In 1872 the county used a venue outside Bristol for the first time when they played at the College Ground in the grounds of Cheltenham College. This venue has continued to be used regularly for the county's annual \"Cheltenham festival\" event, which in the modern era incorporates additional charity events and off-field entertainment. In 1889 Gloucestershire began to play matches at the County Ground in Bristol, which has subsequently served as the club's main headquarters and hosted the majority of the county's matches. It was here that the club played its first List A match in 1963 against Middlesex, and its first Twenty20 match forty years later against Worcestershire. Bristol is not officially part of Gloucestershire and has been considered an independent county since 1373, though it was officially part of the county of Avon from 1974 until 1996. Somerset have played first-class matches at other venues in the city.\nIn the 1920s Gloucestershire ceased playing at the Spa Ground in Gloucester, which had been in use since 1882, and switched to the Wagon Works Ground in the city. This ground remained in use for nearly 70 years, hosting over 150 first-class matches, until its use was discontinued in 1992. In 2012 the club investigated the possibility of returning to the Wagon Works Ground and making it their permanent headquarters after being refused permission for extensive redevelopment of the County Ground in Bristol, but ultimately this did not occur. In 1993, the club moved its base in Gloucester to Archdeacon Meadow, a ground owned by The King's School. This venue was only used for first-class matches until 2008 but was used for four Twenty20 matches in 2010 and 2011, the most recent county games to take place in the city. All subsequent matches have taken place in either Bristol or Cheltenham.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Gloucestershire County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2020 season. Only matches played by Gloucestershire CCC at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\"\nNotes.\nA. First-class cricket matches are designed to be contested over multiple days, with each team permitted two innings with no limit to the number of overs in an innings. List A matches, also known as limited overs or one-day matches, are intended to be completed in a single day and restrict each team to a single innings of between 40 and 60 overs, depending on the specific competition. Twenty20 matches restrict each team to a single innings of 20 overs.\nB. The County Ground, Swindon is located in the adjacent county of Wiltshire.\nC. The County Ground, Trowbridge is located in the adjacent county of Wiltshire."

        "text": "The Philadelphia Bulldogs were a professional American football team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that played in the Continental Football League beginning in 1965. Their regular season games were played at Temple Stadium and in December 1966 they won the league title there by a 20–17 score in overtime against the Orlando Panthers after finishing the regular season 9–5 and tied for the East Division lead with the Toronto Rifles. The winning field goal was kicked by former NFL/Canadian FL player Jamie Caleb. The team disbanded in 1967. The 1966 team was coached by Wayne Hardin, who also coached Temple University afterwards and had come to the Bulldogs from the Naval Academy. The starting quarterback throughout the team's tenure was Bob Brodhead, who was later athletic director at Louisiana State University. The Bulldogs were ranked 21st of the top 25 Philadelphia championship teams of all time in 2011.\nAmong the top players in their championship year were rushing back Claude Watts (who gained 488 yards rushing and 454 receiving) and receivers John Michael Drew (most receptions with 68), Dave Washington (1018 yards gained on 63 passes with 14 TDs) and H.D. Murphy (10 TDs on 57 receptions) while the defense included Bruce Puterbaugh and Tony Golmont (who had 6 interceptions). In 1966 Brodhead (who was not only the team's quarterback but business manager) completed 258 of 491 passing attempts with 27 interceptions for 3199 yards and 39 TDs; he had been the most valuable player in the United Football League before signing with the Bulldogs. In 1966, he was voted All-Star quarterback by the league's coaches. Hardin was named Coach of the Year in 1966 by the Touchdown Club of Philadelphia after the championship.\nThe team also signed Walter Chyzowych as a place kicker and punter, when the prior kicker, George Potts, was injured. Chyzowych was a coach for the U. S. National Men's Soccer team and various other clubs, including Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science and the Philadelphia Fever of the Major Indoor Soccer League. Steve van Buren, the Hall of Famer with the Philadelphia Eagles, was listed as an assistant coach on the team and the broadcasters for the team were the well-known Al Meltzer, on WFIL-560, and Les Keiter on Channel 6.\nHistory.\nThe team was originally formed as the Cleveland Bulldogs in 1961 and played in the minor league United Football League. While in Cleveland the Bulldogs played their home games at Cloverleaf Speedway Stadium in Valley View, Ohio. In 1964 Cleveland's franchise rights were granted to an ownership group based out of Canton, Ohio. The Canton Bulldogs were not the same team as the Cleveland franchise but did have first option to sign any ex-Cleveland players and had exclusive rights to any prospects within 100 miles of Canton.\nThe 1964 Bulldogs won the UFL's Western Division and ended the season with a 19–14 win over the Indianapolis Warriors in what would be the United Football League's final season. Just days prior to the win, head coach Babe Dimancheff announced his resignation amidst reports that the team was nearly $100,000 in debt. The UFL revoked Canton's franchise on December 7 for failure to meet its financial obligations.\nIn December 1965 the Bulldogs franchise was purchased and transferred to Philadelphia, where it became a charter franchise in the Continental Football League. The Bulldogs played their COFL home games at Temple Stadium. The team finished in 2nd place in the COFL's Eastern Division in 1965. Dimancheff was fired as head coach after the season, and was replaced by former Navy head coach Wayne Hardin. Under Hardin the Bulldogs clinched a postseason berth and won the COFL championship. Less than six months later it was announced that the team was withdrawing from the COFL, with an eye toward possibly returning for the 1968 season based out of Tampa, Florida or Charlotte, North Carolina."

        "text": "The 2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship was the 19th staging of the FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the \"\" (FIVB), the sport's global governing body. The final tournament was held in Italy and Bulgaria from 9 to 30 September 2018. For the first time, the tournament was jointly-hosted by more than one country. The final six was hosted by Italy at the Pala Alpitour in Turin.\nPoland defended their world title, defeating the reigning Olympic champions Brazil in straight sets at a repeat of the 2014 final. This was Poland's third title overall, and the third time in the last four editions of the World Championship that Brazil and Poland contested the final. This was also the fifth straight World Championship with Brazil reaching at least the final. United States won the 3rd place match, defeating Serbia in four sets. Bartosz Kurek from Poland was elected the MVP.\nThe first round match between Russia and Tunisia set the new all-time lowest-scoring record in a World Championship set since the new volleyball scoring rules were adopted, with Russia winning the second set by 25–6. The previous record was a 25–8 achieved by United States against Puerto Rico during the 2014 World Championship.\nHost selection.\nOn 9 December 2015, FIVB announced that the tournament would be held in Italy and Bulgaria. For the first time the championship will take place in more than one country. The tournament will take place in six Italian cities (Bari, Bologna,\nFlorence, Assago, Rome and Turin) and three Bulgarian cities (Ruse, Varna and Sofia).\nBoth Italy and Bulgaria have previously hosted the Men's World Championship. Italy last organised the 2010 edition, when Brazil claimed the title their third straight title. Italy also hosted the men's event in 1978 as well as the 2014 Women's World Championship. Moreover, Italy hosted the 1985 Men's U21 World Championship, the 1985 Women's U20 World Championship and the 2009 Boys' U19 World Championship. Bulgaria, on the other hand, hosted both the men's and women's senior editions in 1970. Both countries have also played hosts to other important volleyball competitions, including the Men's European Volleyball Championship and the World League final round.\nQualification.\nThe qualification process was a series of tournaments organised by the five FIVB confederations to decide 21 of the 24 teams which would play in the final tournament, with Italy and Bulgaria qualifying automatically as hosts and Poland also qualifying automatically as the defending champions. All remaining FIVB member associations were eligible to enter the qualifying process.\nAt first, 150 associations registered teams to compete in the qualification process, but 19 associations withdrew from the qualifying process after they registered and India were suspended and then expelled from taking part in the process as a punishment for internal problems in the India Volleyball Federation.\nThe five regional governing bodies were allocated the remaining 21 spots; CAVB (Africa) was granted three, AVC (Asia and Oceania) four, NORCECA (North America) five, CSV (South America) two, and CEV (Europe) seven spots.\nOf the 24 nations qualified to play at the 2018 World Championship, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Slovenia qualified for the first time. Other teams returning after absences of the last tournament(s) include: Dominican Republic, returning to the finals after their only previous appearance in 1974, Netherlands, who last competed in 2002, and Japan, who missed the 2014 edition.\nNotable countries that failed to qualify include the 2014 third placed Germany, Venezuela (for the first time since 1998), South Korea and Czech Republic.\nFormat.\nIn the first round, the 24 teams were spread across four pools of six teams playing in a single round-robin format. The top four teams in each pool qualified for the second round, featuring four pools of four teams playing in four cities.\nThe second round featured four pools of four teams playing once again in a single round-robin format. At the end of the second round matches, the rankings of the four pools were drawn up taking into account the points scored by each team in the first and second rounds. The four pool-winning teams of the second round qualified for the third round, together with the top two of the second placed teams.\nThe six teams competing in the third round were divided into two three-team pools by a draw. After the matches played once again in a single round-robin format, the top two teams in each pool qualified for the semifinals and finals.\nThe third round pool winners played against the runners-up in this round. The semifinals winners advanced to compete for the World Championship title. The losers faced each other in the 3rd place match.\nPools composition.\nFirst round.\nTeams were seeded in the first two positions of each pool following the serpentine system according to their FIVB World Ranking as of 7 July 2017. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pools A and D regardless of the World Ranking. All teams not seeded were drawn to take other available positions in the remaining lines, following the World Ranking. Each pool had no more than three teams from the same confederation. The draw was held in Florence, Italy on 30 November 2017. Rankings are shown in brackets except the hosts Italy and Bulgaria who ranked 4th and 14th respectively.\nThird round.\nThe third round draw was held in Turin, Italy on 24 September 2018.

        "title": "Singapore Swimming Association",
        "text": "Singapore Aquatics (abbreviation: SAQ) is the national governing body for competitive swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, water polo and open water swimming in Singapore. SAQ is also charged with selecting the Singapore Olympic Swimming team and any other teams that officially represent Singapore, as well as the overall organisation and operation of the sport within the country. \nSwimming is the country's strongest sport. Singapore was the best nation at the inaugural Asian Games for swimming. It peaked when Singaporean swimmer Joseph Schooling won an Olympic gold medal at the Men's 100 metre butterfly, the first Asian swimmer ever to do so, having also broke the Olympic record in the process. Singapore is also a powerhouse in swimming at the regional Southeast Asian Games, having consistently been the best nation for most of its editions and winning the most medals by a wide margin.\nFounded in 1939 as the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association (abbreviation: SASA); the body adopted its current name in 2002. It has been a member of FINA since its founding, and is one of the founding members of the Asia Swimming Federation. Its headquarters are located at 7 Stadium Drive in Kallang.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nIn April 1939, 3 major swimming clubs (namely the Singapore Swimming Club, Chinese Swimming Club, and the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)) formed the Singapore Amateur Swimming Association (SASA). Immediately after this formation, the Tiger Swimming Club, Singapore Cantonese Swimming Union, Overseas Chinese Swimming Union and the land, sea and air force units of the British Armed Forces joined SASA as Affiliates.\nHalt in activities.\nAll SASA activities were halted from 1939 to 1945 due to World War II.\nParticipation in international competitions for swimming, diving and water polo resumed in 1948 after the war.\nRenaming and growth.\nJune 1986: Four training branches were established under the SPEX21 Development Programme: Bedok, Clementi, Queenstwon and Toa Payoh with the full support and endorsement of then Singapore Sports Council (now Sport Singapore).\n2002: SASA was renamed Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) to signify the movement towards professional management of swimming, water polo, diving, and synchronised swimming and its governance.\n2004: Leadership transition and changes from SSA occurred due to a need to comply with the Code of Governance.\n2007: SSA Branches and the People's Association joined forces under the auspices of The Grassroots Aquatic Club (TGAC).\n2023: SSA rebranded itself as Singapore Aquatics.\nSwimming.\n2005: SSA introduced a new concept of competition focus (Target vs Preparatory) at the different elite and developmental levels. Performance-based selection criteria, with stipulated Qualifying Windows, were introduced and published on the web for the public to access.\nFollowing the new concept, SSA revamped the 1st Singapore National Swimming Championships 2005 held in June, which incorporated international competition format. This meant heats were swam in the morning, evening finals sessions, dope testing, etc.\n2006: Singapore hosted its first major regional swimming competition with the Milo 7th Asia Swimming Championships Singapore 2006 in March.\nIn the same year on the FINA front, SSA won the right to host the FINA Swimming World Cup Series 2007–2009 (April). SSA also hosted two FINA events: the FINA Marathon Swimming World Cup 2006 and the FINA 7th World Swimming Officials Seminar Singapore 2006 (October).\nThe latter event saw over 100 officials from nearly 50 different countries in attendance.\n2007: SSA successfully hosted the FINA/Arena Swimming World Cup 2007 Singapore at the Singapore Sports School Swimming Complex in October. It was the first highest-level aquatics competition to ever be run in Singapore. In a fitting tribute, Natalie Coughlin (USA) broke the 100m Backstroke (SCM) World Record, 'christening' this world-class competition venue.\nIn the same month, SSA also hosted the FINA Fuji Xerox 10 km Marathon Swimming World Cup 2007.\n2009: Former National Swimmer and Olympian Ang Peng Siong was appointed as Singapore's first National Head Coach of Swimming.\n2010: SSA organised the 1st Inter-School Synchronised Swimming Competition held at the Co-Curricular Activities Branch.\nSingapore also hosted the first edition of the 2010 Summer Youth Olympic Games (YOG) at the Singapore Sports School Swimming Complex.\n2012: International coach Ian Turner was appointed SSA's national swimming technical director and head coach.\n2014: The opening of the Singapore Sports Hub began with the opening of its first facility, the OCBC Aquatic Center, which henceforth will serve as home to Singapore Aquatic Sports (namely, Swimming, Synchronised Swimming, Water Polo, and Diving).\n2015: Former Olympian and competitive swimmer Sergio Lopez was appointed as the national head coach (swimming). He and national assistant head coach Gary Tan then established the National Training Center (NTC), where all national swimmers will train together.\nSSA then launched its \"Swim With Us\" campaign, announcing a brand new identity for the National team. The campaign was an initiative to rally the public behind aquatic sports in Singapore.\nThe perfect opportunity for Coaches Sergio and Gary to put the effectiveness of the new system to the test arrived in the form of the 28th South-East Asian Games in June. All aquatic events of the 2015 SEA Games were held at the OCBC Aquatic Center, Singapore. A total of 29 swimmers represented Singapore, competing on home ground. They walked away at the end of the meet with a record-breaking 42 medals, the highest medal tally amongst all other sports in Singapore.\nIn the same year, SSA sent a total of 11 athletes to compete in the 16th FINA World Championships held in Kazan, Russia.\nSSA also successfully hosted the 5th FINA World Junior Swimming Championships at the OCBC Aquatic Center.\nWater Polo.\n2006: Water Polo began its rebuilding process with leadership renewal.\n2008: SSA hosted its first major international water polo tournament, The Road To Beijing Pre-Olympics Water Polo Invitation 2008. The event saw top water polo teams from Australia, China, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Russia engage in a talented display of strategy and athleticism.\nDiving.\n2007: SSA restarted its diving programme after a lapse of 12 years.\n2010: Despite SSA's efforts to make its mark on the diving scene, they saw little success with the National Diving Team. It was only at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympic Games (YOG) where Singapore Diving made its comeback after 7 years. All diving events of the 2010 YOG were held at the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex.\n2016: In January, Shannon Roy was appointed National Head Coach (Diving), following the resignation of Former National Head Coach Xiu Jie who returned to Canada to be with his family."

The season saw seven new manufacturers, who were allowed to develop new power trains, specifically the e-motor, the inverter, the gearbox and the cooling system. Nelson Piquet Jr. was the defending Drivers' Champion and Renault the defending teams' champion. After ten rounds, Sébastien Buemi won the championship by just two points over Lucas di Grassi after setting the fastest lap in the final race, where neither driver finished following an opening lap crash and several attempts to set the fastest lap in their second cars. Renault retained the teams' championship.\nTeams and drivers.\nThe second season was planned to again feature ten teams that were essentially identical from the inaugural season. But, the withdrawal of Trulli after failing to enter the first two races left nine teams competing for the 2015–16 season. Additionally, there were eight manufacturers of power trains that worked together with or were part of the individual teams. Initially only Team Aguri decided to keep the power train from the previous season, while Dragon used the Venturi power train. Due to the regulations, all teams used the same chassis as in the first season. The eight manufacturers were homologated by the FIA in August 2015. After troublesome preseason testing, Andretti decided to revert to the power train from the inaugural season. All teams used the mandated Spark chassis.\n‡ Drivers were present at the first two rounds of the championship, but the team failed to pass scrutineering both times.\nCalendar.\nThe season was scheduled to include 11 races, held between October 2015 and July 2016. The final calendar was approved by the World Motor Sport Council in October 2015. However, in May 2016, the Moscow ePrix was cancelled \"due to recent and unforeseen circumstances related to road closures\", reducing the season to 10 races.\nChampionship standings.\nChampionship points are awarded as follows:\nUnlike the previous season, all results count towards the total.\nDrivers' Championship.\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance.\nTeams' Championship.\n† – Drivers did not finish the race, but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the race distance."

Races are typically between 45 and 60 minutes and are conducted on circuits with little to no vehicle traffic. Racing caters for all levels of riders, from elite male and female professionals to juniors and novice riders. It is not uncommon for 300+ riders to attend a day's racing.\nAt the elite end, A Grade has hosted some of the world's best riders, including:\nGlenvale Crescent has also hosted some of the world's leading female riders, including:\nFor most of the season, women race alongside men, with prizes paid for the first ~3 women across the line in each grade (depending on overall numbers). There also 2–3 women's only races held over the course of the summer criterium racing season.\nThe club also conducts a cycling clinic for junior riders at both Glendale Crescent and Sandown each week. Riders are taught bunch riding and racing skills by Tokyo Olympian Mick Hollingworth for around 20 minutes before they are set free to race for 10 minutes.\nRace entries are accepted on the day.\nCarnegie Caulfield's summer criterium are internationally renowned and have been cited as some of the best racing in Australia.\nMultiple independent websites provided advice to new riders looking to get into racing with Carnegie Caulfield\nTrack racing.\nCarnegie Caulfield offers track racing for riders of all levels.
