        "text": "The men's slalom in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of ten events, including the discipline final. \nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The men's slalom was held in Courchevel on 19 February.\nSeason Summary.\nThrough six races, Lucas Braathen of Norway held a narrow lead over countryman and defending champion Henrik Kristoffersen and Swiss ace Daniel Yule, with each having won twice. In the seventh race, Braathen widened his lead by being the only member of that trio to reach the podium. However, just a few days later, Braathen learned that he had an appendix infection and needed immediate surgery, which forced him to miss the next slalom at Chamonix and potentially the 2023 World Championships, with his return still uncertain post-surgery. \nBraathen did return, although Kristoffersen won the World Championships in slalom with Braathen seventh. Coming into the finals, Braathen was still 32 points ahead of Kristoffersen, meaning that he was assured of the discipline title if he finished no worse than second in the final. And finishing second was exactly what he did, with Kristoffersen finishing just behind in third, which gave Braathen the season title. Switzerland's Ramon Zenhäusern won the last race (by 0.06 seconds) to complete the race podium and thus placed third for the season ahead of his countryman Yule, who failed to finish.\nThe World Cup discipline finals took place on Sunday, 19 March 2023, in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 in the slalom discipline ranking and the winner of the Junior World Championship were eligible to compete in the final, except that all skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification were able to compete in any discipline (but none did in slalom). Only the top 15 finishers in each discipline final scored points."

As softball grew in popularity Dr Fredericks moved to the Marsa Sports Complex, and using borrowed equipment from the Verdala International School he started to teach baseball. The early players of the sport on the island, under the tutelage of Dr Fredericks, were mainly Canadian and US citizens living in Malta. Maltese children soon began to take up the sports, the legacy of which can be seen today in that Patrick Pace, the founder of the Mustangs Baseball Club was one of those children.\nThe Malta Baseball and Softball Association was formed in 1983, with the support of representatives from the Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball. MABS joined the Confederation of European Baseball in 1983 and in 2010, it joined the European Softball Federation (ESF).\nMABS Board.\nThe current MABS board is comprised as follows:"

The Golden Gophers represented the University of Minnesota and were coached by Elwin Romnes in his 1st season.\nSeason.\n\"Doc\" Romnes took over after the retirement of long-time coach, Larry Armstrong and put the team through its paces. Early in the season, Minnesota welcomed in a junior team from Winnipeg as a tune-up for their slate of collegiate opponents. Unfortunately, the Canadiens already had several games under their belt and they used that experience to full effect, dropping the Gophers in back-to-back contests. After the game, Romnes switched up his forward lines in the hopes of producing a better result for the team. Unfortunately, the Gophers lost each of the next three games. They were able to get wins in the two matches against California to salvage their 10-day road trip, but the team was likely already out of the running for an NCAA tournament berth.\nWhen the team returned home they dispatched Harvard in a pair of games to give their fans some hope. The reprieve was short, however, as the Gophers lost the next 5 games and lost any chance they had at being in the postseason. To make matters worse, just prior to the series with North Dakota, the team lost its starting goalie, Jack McEwan, due to academic ineligibility and would have to rely in Ken Austin for the remainder of the year.\nThe team recovered to go 5–2 in the later portion of the season but that couldn't stop the Gophers from ending the year with a losing record for the first time in a decade.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular Season"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a shortstop leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. Shortstop, abbreviated SS, is a baseball or softball fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and third base, which is considered to be among the most demanding defensive positions. The position is mostly filled by defensive specialists, so shortstops are generally relatively poor batters who typically hit lower in the batting order. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the shortstop is assigned the number 6.\nShortstops typically record a double play by fielding a ground ball and then either throwing to the second baseman to force out the runner advancing to second base, or stepping on the base themselves before throwing to first base to retire the batter/runner, or by receiving a throw from another player to force a runner at second base before the throw to first base is made. Shortstops generally benefit in this respect from playing alongside an excellent second baseman with great range and quickness; strong middle infields are regarded as crucial to a team's defensive play, and double play totals are regarded as a strong indicator of their defensive skill. Double plays are also recorded when the shortstop catches a line drive, then throws to a base before the runner can tag up, or another infielder or the pitcher catches the line drive and then throws to the shortstop in the same situation; on occasion, the throw might come from an outfielder after an unexpected catch of a fly ball. Other double plays occur when the shortstop records an out at second base, then throws out a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, or on a double steal attempt in which the catcher throws out a runner attempting to steal second base, and the shortstop throws back to the catcher to retire a runner trying to steal home. Double plays are also occasionally recorded when a rundown play is involved, almost always as the second out. Because of the high number of ground outs, shortstops and second basemen typically record far more double plays than players at any other position except first base.\nMost of the career leaders are relatively recent players who have benefitted from improved infield defense, with equipment of better quality; nine of the top twelve players made their major league debut after 1969, and only one was active before 1951. Five of the top nine players spent their entire careers with one team. Longer careers have compensated for the fact that as strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined, with double play totals for shortstops likewise declining; 18 of the top 25 single-season totals were recorded between 1944 and 1988, and none of the top 478 were recorded before 1920. Omar Vizquel holds the record for the most career double plays by a shortstop with 1,734. Only three other shortstops have recorded 1,500 career double plays."

Saudi Arabia won the match by a score of 3–2 to claim their first World Cup title.\nTeams.\nCommittees and players.\nEach country has a National Competition Committee, consisting of a general manager, head coach, and social lead, who are responsible for organizing tryouts for their country. Blizzard chose committees via an application process, which began in February 2023. Throughout three weekends in February, every committee hosted an open format tournament, called World Cup Trials. The winning team of each World Cup Trial won and earned an automatic invitation to their country's team tryouts in March 2023.

It is scheduled to be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in October and November 2027. This will be the second time that South Africa and Zimbabwe will have co-hosted the tournament, after the 2003 edition, while Namibia will host it for the first time. The tournament will expand to 14 teams, and will have the same format that was used during the 2003 edition. Australia are the defending champions, having defeated India in the final of the previous edition.\nQualification.\nSouth Africa and Zimbabwe as co-hosts along with the top eight teams in the ICC ODI rankings as of 31 March 2027 will qualify directly for the competition, while the remaining four spots will be decided through global qualifier tournaments. Although Namibia will co-host the competition for the first time, they will not be guaranteed a spot because they are not a full ICC member, and as a result, they will have to go through the standard qualification pathway.\nFormat.\nThe competition will use two groups of seven teams, with the top three teams in each group progressing to a Super Six stage, followed by semi-finals and a final. Each team in a group will play all the other sides in the same group once. The format was previously used in the 2003 edition. However, a modified version of points carry forward (PCF) from 1999 edition will be re-introduced in the 2027 edition.\nVenues.\nOn 10 April 2024, Cricket South Africa confirmed the eight shortlisted venues for the tournament. Pholetsi Moseki, CEO of the board told that out of eleven ICC accredited venues in South Africa, the final eight venues were selected based off of various factors like availability of airports and hotel accomodations. Venues for Namibia and Zimbabwe have not been decided as of April 2024."

It was the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the 2023 ATP Tour.\nThis is the 54th edition of the tournament (49th in doubles), and the third time Turin hosted the ATP Tour year-end championships.\nPoints and prize money.\nThe 2023 ATP Finals rewarded the following points and prize money, per victory\nFormat.\nThe ATP Finals group stage has a round-robin format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four and each player/team in a group playing the other three in the group. The eight seeds were determined by the Pepperstone ATP rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches, including the final, were best of three sets with tie-breaks in each set including the third. All doubles matches were two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.\nIn deciding placement within a group, the following criteria were used, in order:\nIf after criterion 4 there was one superior/inferior player and the other two were tied, the head-to-head result was used to sort these two players. Criteria 5-6 were thus used only in case three players were all tied after the evaluation of criteria 1-4. \nThe top two of each group advanced to semifinals, with the winner of each group playing the runner-up of the other group. The winners of the semifinals then played for the title.\nQualification.\nSingles.\nEight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the \"ATP Race to Turin\", coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP Tour, United Cup, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Tour tournaments. Players accrue points across 19 tournaments, usually made up of:\nDoubles.\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternate. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in singles.

        "text": "The rowing competitions at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are scheduled to run from 27 July to 3 August at the National Olympic Nautical Stadium of Île-de-France in Vaires-sur-Marne. The number of rowers competing across fourteen gender-based categories at these Games has been reduced from 526 to 502, with an equal distribution between men and women. Despite the slight changes in athlete figures, the rowing program for Paris 2024 remains constant from the previous edition as the competition will feature an equal number of categories for men and women, with seven each.\nCompetition format.\nThe rowing program featured a total of fourteen events, seven each for both men and women in identical boat classes. This gender equality was suggested by the World Rowing Federation at its February 2017 congress, with the recommendation adopted by the International Olympic Committee in June 2017. As a result, this balance deleted the men's lightweight four and added the women's coxless four classes. The women's coxless four previously ran at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics; the only time this boat class was an Olympic event. The changes to the Olympic rowing schedule were the first since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\nEvents for the 2024 Paris Olympics consisted two rowing disciplines: sweep rowing, where competitors each use a single oar, and sculling, where they use two placed on opposite sides of the boat. They also included a single lightweight (weight restricted) event for each gender: the lightweight double sculls. Sculling events included men's and women's singles, doubles, lightweight doubles, and quads. Sweep events included men's and women's coxless pairs, coxless fours, and eights.\nQualification.\n502 rowing quota places are available for Paris 2024, about twenty-four less overall than those in Tokyo 2020. Qualified NOCs are entitled to enter a single boat for each of the fourteen categories.\nThe qualification period commences at the 2023 World Rowing Championships, scheduled for 3 to 10 September in Belgrade, Serbia, where about two-thirds of the total quota will be awarded to the highest-ranked crews across fourteen categories. Explicitly, these quota places will be distributed to the NOCs, not to specific rowers, finishing among the top nine in the single sculls (both men and women), top seven in the lightweight double sculls, fours, and quadruple sculls, top five in the eights, and top eleven each in the pairs and double sculls. The remainder of the total quota will be attributed to the eligible rowers at each of the four continental qualification regattas in Asia and Oceania, the Americas, Africa, and Europe, and at the final Olympic qualification regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland.\nAs the host country, France reserves one quota place in the men's and women's single sculls. Four quota places (two per gender) are entitled to the NOCs competing in the same category under the Tripartite Commission. \nParticipation.\nEvents by number of boats entered.\nEach event shares the same number of boats entered for men and women."

        "text": "A glass basketball court is a basketball court with a glass floor that uses light emitting diodes (LEDs) to display the court lines and other graphics. \nHistory.\nASB GlassFloor, a German manufacturer, first demonstrated a glass court for sports including basketball in 2011. Its first installation was for a 3x3 basketball event in Berlin in 2014. The company makes two different kinds of glass floor that are approved by FIBA for tier 1 competitions: ASB MultiSports, which offers LED lines, and ASB LumiFlex, which allows full motion video and player tracking. The LumiFlex option can display statistics and advertising for spectators in the arena in ways comparable to digital on-screen graphics on television broadcasts. \nIn 2017, FIBA had allowed another manufacturer to supply LED-lined glass floors for tier 2 and tier 3 competitions, noting that it passed the association's requirements for player and ball reaction against the surface, and avoided the redundant lines on many existing multi-use courts. After successful trials, FIBA approved glass courts on October 1, 2022, for tier-1 competitions such as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, and a glass court would be used for the first time during the 2023 FIBA Under-19 Women's Basketball World Cup in Madrid.\nIn 2014, Nike developed a glass court with AKQA, Rhizomatiks and WiSpark for an exhibition in Shanghai. The company invited 30 players to practice with Kobe Bryant on the court, nicknamed the \"House of Mamba.\" The custom court included motion tracking and lighting that could track players as they ran drills.\nGlass courts are installed in several European basketball arenas, including the BallsportArena Dresden, the OYM Performance Center in Switzerland, and an arena at the University of Oxford.\nIn February 2024, the NBA held the Saturday night activities of All-Star weekend, including the skills challenge, on a glass court at Lucas Oil Stadium. The All-Star Game proper was played at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, on a traditional court.\nDisadvantages.\nAs of June 2022, a MultiSports floor costs about $80–90 (USD) per square foot and a LumiFlex floor costs about $500 per square foot; a full NBA court with LumiFlex technology would cost about $2 million, leading to doubt about its viability for widespread adoption. \nA glass court cannot be laid atop an ice surface, making it unsuitable for multi-purpose arenas which host both ice hockey and basketball games during overlapping schedules."

        "text": "Taylor Samantha Baker (born July 30, 1997) is a Hungarian-Canadian ice hockey defender for New York of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) and member of the Hungarian national team.\nPlaying career.\nBaker began playing ice hockey early in her childhood, around 3 or 4 years of age, and developed on minor teams in her home city of Toronto. Her junior career was played with the Toronto Jr. Aeros in the Provincial Women's Hockey League (Provincial WHL). She played one regular season game with the Jr. Aeros in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 Provincial WHL seasons before fully joining the team for the 2014–15 season. Across her final two seasons with the team, 2014–15 and 2015–16, she scored 10 goals and 19 assists for 29 points in 72 games and racked up 62 penalty minutes. During Baker’s four seasons with the Jr. Aeros, the team's roster featured a number of future Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) and Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) players, including Jessie Eldridge, Loren Gabel, Mikyla Grant-Mentis, Emma Greco, Sarah Knee, Daryl Watts, and Breanne Wilson-Bennett.\nNCAA.\nHer college ice hockey career was played with the RIT Tigers women's ice hockey program in the College Hockey America (CHA) conference of the NCAA Division I during 2016 to 2020. A traditional stay-at-home defenceman, Baker amassed modest collegiate statistics in offensive categories but was a standout in blocked shots. She led the team in her first season with 60 blocked shots and tallied 49 and 45 blocked shots respectively in the following two seasons.\nProfessional.\nThe end of Baker’s college career coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America. Options to play in Canada or the United States were suddenly in short supply, so she pursued opportunities in Europe and opted to sign with the women’s ice hockey team of MAC Budapest, which plays in the European Women's Hockey League (EWHL) and the Női OB I bajnokság. She played the 2020–21 season and 2021–22 season with MAC Budapest. \nReturning to Canada after six years playing abroad, Baker signed with the PHF's newest expansion team, the Montreal Force, one day before the 2022–23 PHF season began. That season, she and Christine Deaudelin tied as the Force’s top scoring defencemen, with 9 points each. \nInternational play.\nBaker was offered Hungarian citizenship and the chance to compete with the Hungarian national team while playing with MAC Budapest. She made her debut with the Hungarian national team in the qualification tournament for the 2022 Winter Olympics, at which Hungary narrowly missed qualifying. Her first IIHF Women's World Championship was the 2022 Top Division tournament in Denmark and she also represented Hungary at the 2023 Top Division tournament.\nPersonal life.\nBaker was born on July 30, 1997, in Toronto to Nancy and Peter Baker.

The Panthers represented Middlebury College and were coached by Duke Nelson, in his 6th season.\nSeason.\nMiddlebury's season began with a trip to Clinton, New York for a tournament held by Hamilton. The first two games could hardly have gone better for the Panthers as they pumped 39 goal into the net to post the two most overwhelming wins in program history. They concluded the series by defeated the host Continentals in a much closer game and began the year with a stirling record.\nA week later, the team headed down to Boston to begin their conference slate and came away with mixed results. While they were swamped by Northeastern in the first game, the Panthers managed to pull out a victory against MIT the following night. By the end of the week they had returned to Vermont for their first two home games of the year and produced two more wins against in-state rivals. After coming from behind to force a tie with Williams, Jim Marchese broke a bone in his foot at practice and was expected to miss the remainder of the season.\nhe team did not play again until after the exam break. In their first game following the layoff, it appeared that the team had retained its form from earlier when they downed Union for the third time. However, they lost the very next evening to Norwich. The loss put them in 3rd place in the NEIHL standings but they had a rough road ahead. Before that happened, Middlebury wrapped up its unofficial state championship with a second won over Vermont. Unfortunately, the victory was bittersweet as Fluff Grocott joined Marchese on the injured list while Bill McNamara, the team's leading scorer, was removed from the team.\nMiddlebury ended its season with a southern swing and ended up losing its final three games of the year. While the loss to Army didn't harm the Panthers' chances for a postseason bid, the whitewashing at the hands of Boston College meant that the team needed to beat Boston University in order to finish in the top four. Against all odds, Middlebury put forth a commendable performance versus one of the nation's top teams but fell just short, losing 4–5. The pair of losses dropped the Panthers to 6th place, just behind MIT and Bowdoin and signaled the end of the season.\nRobert H. Shahan served as team manager.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Silver Anniversary Hamilton Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

As a result, the offense could barely score for most of the season while the defense was porous. The only thing that seemed to keep the Royals in any of their games was the play of the goaltenders. Elliot Schafer was the best player for the opening match against Tufts while George Adams, the understudy, had a marvelous performance versus Bowdoin by making 75 saves.\nIt's unclear how many games the team managed to play as the school's records cease after the match with Bowdoin.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#002E5D; \" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The archery competitions at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are scheduled to run over a seven-day period, from 25 July to 4 August, at Les Invalides. 128 archers (64 for each gender) will compete across five events, with the successful mixed team recurve returning to the Olympic program for the second time.\nQualification.\nIn the initial quarter of 2022, the International Olympic Committee and World Archery agreed to change the rules on the allocation of the Olympic quota places, ensuring the vast promotion of geographical universal opportunities for the archers around the world at the Games. A total of 128 quota places, with an equal distribution between men and women, will be awarded at the top-level global and continental meets.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) is permitted to enter a maximum of six archers, three per gender. NOCs that qualify for a gender-based team recurve can select three members to form a squad, ensuring that each of them must compete in the individual recurve. \nTwelve slots are available for each gender in the team recurve events, with thirty-six individuals competing against each other through a team-based qualification pathway. While three tickets remain available at the final qualifying meet, the number of quota places at the Worlds has been reduced to three that climb the podium. The other five tickets will be assigned instead to the continental team champions from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and to the top two teams vying for qualification through the world rankings after the final qualifying meet.\nThroughout the process, twenty-eight individual quota places will be awarded to the highest-ranked archers at the 2023 World Championships in Berlin, Germany, the continental Games (European Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games), whether mixed team champions or individual recurve gold medalists, the standalone continental meets (Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas), and at the final qualification tournament, scheduled for mid-2024.\nHost nation France reserves three quota places each for the men's and women's events, along with the mixed team recurve, while four coveted spots are entitled to the eligible NOCs interested to have their archers compete in Paris 2024, as granted by the Universality principle.\nCompetition format.\nA total of 128 athletes are expected to compete across the five events: the men's and women's individual recurve, the men's and women's team recurve, and the mixed team recurve, an event added to the program since Tokyo 2020.\nAll five events are scheduled to be recurve archery events, held under the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and rules. The competition begins with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer will shoot a maximum of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1–64 according to their score. Aside from the individual marks, the ranking round will seed the men's and women's teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team. Additionally, the ranking round is scheduled to determine the 16 pairs qualifying for the mixed team event (specifically, for the nations consisting of both a male and a female archer, the top men's score and the top women's score are combined), along with the top 16 seeds.\nEach event is staged through a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semifinal losers, who played off to decide the bronze medal winner.\nIndividual events.\nIn the individual events, all 64 archers entered the competition in the first round. The draw is seeded based on the result of the ranking round, so the first seed shoots against the sixty-fourth seed in the initial round.\nEach match will be scored through the Archery Olympic Round, consisting of the best-of-five sets, with three arrows per set. The winner of each set receives two points. If the scores in the set are tied, then each archer receives one point. If at the end of five sets the score is tied at 5–5, a single arrow shoot-off is held and the closest to the center will be declared the winner.\nMen's and women's team events.\nIn the team events, the top four seeded teams from the ranking round will be advanced directly to the quarterfinal stage. The remaining eight teams, seeded fifth to twelfth, will contest against each other for the remaining half of the quarterfinal places.\nThe team event follows the same Archery Olympic Round set system, as the individual event, although each set consists of six arrows (two per team member) and only four sets are held.\nMixed team event.\nIn the mixed team event, the top 16 seeded teams from the ranking round will compete in a single-elimination bracket. Similar to the men's and women's team events, the set system uses two arrows per team member (which denotes four arrows per NOC in the mixed team) and four sets.\nTechnical officials: 2024 Olympics.\nSource:"

        "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for archery at the 2024 Summer Olympics. The competition at these Games will comprise a total of 128 archers, with an equal distribution between men and women (64 per gender), coming from their respective NOCs; each is permitted to enter a maximum of six archers, three per gender. NOCs that qualify for a gender-based team recurve can select three members to form a squad, ensuring that each of them must compete in the individual recurve.\nTwelve slots are available for each gender in the team recurve events, with thirty-six individuals competing against each other through a team-based qualification pathway. While three tickets remain available at the final qualifying meet, the number of quota places at the Worlds has been reduced to three that climb the podium. The other five tickets will be assigned instead to the continental team champions from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and to the top two teams vying for qualification through the world rankings after the final qualifying meet.\nThroughout the process, twenty-eight individual quota places will be awarded to the highest-ranked archers at the 2023 World Championships in Berlin, Germany, the continental Games (European Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games), whether mixed team champions or individual recurve gold medalists, the standalone continental meets (Africa, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas), and at the final qualification tournament, scheduled for mid-2024.\nHost nation France reserves three quota places each for the men's and women's events, along with the mixed team recurve, while four coveted spots are entitled to the eligible NOCs interested to have their archers compete in Paris 2024, as granted by the Universality principle.\nTo eligibly participate at the Games after obtaining a quota place for NOC, all archers must attain the following minimum qualification standards (MQS) on a 72-arrow, 70-metre round between the first day of the 2023 World Championships and the final entry at a registered World Archery event.\nQualifying standards.\nQualification occurs through a hierarchy of events instead of dates, so the qualified NOC might vacate the coveted spot through an earlier low-priority meet if it eventually grants a qualifying pathway in a higher-priority event (this particularly affects the European Games, held before the World Championships). The following priority order will be respected from highest to lowest to allocate the quota places: (1) World Championships, (2) continental games, (3) continental championships, (4) final qualification tournaments.\nThe medal-winning squads (gold, silver, and bronze) in the team event from the 2023 Worlds will secure a quota place for their NOC at the Olympics. If the host country France obtains a team place at the Worlds, the vacant slot will be reallocated to the fourth-place team. Three more tickets will each be assigned to the men's and women's team recurve champions from the 2022 Asian Games, the 2023 European Games, and the 2024 Pan American Championships, respectively. The top three or four NOCs per gender (depending on whether France uses its direct host place or qualifies for the Games through the regular competition pathway) will secure three quota places at the Final Olympic Qualification Tournament (FOQT), scheduled for mid-2024, while the remaining team tickets will be awarded to the two highest-ranked NOCs vying for qualification through the world rankings after FOQT.\nTwenty-eight individual quota places will be awarded across the five competition phases and through the universality invitation. Three highest-ranked archers outside the team-based qualification will secure a single quota place for their NOC in the men's and women's individual recurve, respectively, at the 2023 Worlds, while six spots will be assigned to each of the top two archers from Europe, Asia, and the Americas at the continental Games. All five continents will stage standalone continental tournaments throughout the qualifying calendar with a specified number of quota places available: Europe (3) and Asia, Africa, and the Americas (2 each), and Oceania (1). The Final Olympic Qualification Tournament, held at the end of the qualifying period, will allocate two more spots per gender for the highest-ranked eligible archers from their respective NOCs. The remaining tickets in each individual recurve are entitled to the eligible NOCs whose archers are interested to compete in Paris 2024 as duly recognized by the Universality principle.\nThe mixed team recurve champions from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania will obtain a quota place per gender in the individual events for Paris 2024 at their respective continental Games.\nWomen's events.\nFrance finished in the top three at the World Championships, so an additional team quota space is allocated to the Final Team Qualification Tournament."

        "title": "BYU–Gonzaga men's basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The BYU–Gonzaga men's basketball rivalry is a college basketball rivalry between the Gonzaga Bulldogs team of Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington and the BYU Cougars team of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. BYU has played Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament final in 2014, 2015, 2018, and 2021 with Gonzaga winning all four of these matchups. Gonzaga leads the overall series 25–7, with the most recent meeting on February 11, 2023. On September 10, 2021, the Big 12 Conference unanimously accepted BYU's application to the conference, joining for the 2023–24 season and leaving the future of the series in doubt.\nSeries overview.\nFirst meetings.\nBYU and Gonzaga first played on December 16, 1949, at a neutral court holiday tournament in California. The two teams would not meet again until March 19, 2011, in the third round of the NCAA tournament, as a BYU team led by National Player of the Year Jimmer Fredette advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. Fredette scored 34 points and the Cougars defeated the Zags 89–67, the largest BYU win in the series to this day. The following season, BYU left the Mountain West Conference and joined the West Coast Conference for the 2011–2012 season.\nConference foes.\nSince the Cougars joined the WCC, Gonzaga has compiled a 24–6 record against BYU. However, BYU is one of few teams to win multiple times at the McCarthey Athletic Center in Spokane over the last decade, with three consecutive wins at the Kennel in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (the first two were later vacated by the NCAA due to a scandal involving BYU guard Nick Emery). BYU was the only team to beat #1 ranked Gonzaga during the 2016-17 regular season in which Gonzaga earned its first trip to the Final Four and National Championship game. The Cougars triumphed 79–71 over the 29–0 Zags, overcoming an 18–2 deficit in the game's opening minutes and a 12-point second half hole. BYU's Eric Mika led the way with 29 points and 11 rebounds to hand undefeated Gonzaga its lone loss of the regular season on senior night.\nIn 2020, on Senior Night at the Marriott Center, No. 23 BYU knocked off No. 2 Gonzaga 91–78 in front of a sellout crowd. As the final buzzer sounded, delirious fans rushed the court for a jubilant celebration — just weeks before the NCAA Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That was the most recent Cougar win over the Bulldogs.\nIn the final WCC campaign for BYU, Julian Strawther etched his name into the rivalry's lore when he knocked down the game-winning 3-pointer in the Zags’ 75–74 win in Provo. Gonzaga won the return game 88–81 in Spokane, finishing 9–3 at the Kennel against the Cougars. Those three losses were the most inflicted by a WCC opponent since BYU joined in 2012; fellow WCC powerhouse Saint Mary's is 2–9 and all other conference programs are 1–75 on the road against the Zags during this period. This is the last scheduled regular season meeting, as BYU prepares to move to the Big 12 Conference next season. Both programs and their respective head coaches have expressed interest in continuing the rivalry in non=conference play; Gonzaga star Drew Timme emphasized the importance of the series: “I think it’s a special rivalry. And one that should continue even past them leaving the conference,” he said. “I think it’s something that we should do home-and-homes forever. … I feel like it’s developed into such a great rivalry.”.\nRival Accomplishments.\nThe following summarizes the accomplishments of the two programs.\nGame results.\nBelow is a complete list of series results. Rankings are from the AP Poll at the time of the game."

        "text": "David Richard Peterson (January 5, 1931July 17, 1997) was an American ice hockey coach. He grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota, graduated from Hamline University, and played semi-professional hockey as a goaltender for the Minneapolis Millers. He served as head coach of ice hockey at Southwest High School from 1955 to 1982, where he also taught business. His teams qualified for 14 Minnesota State High School League tournaments, which included an undefeated 1969–70 season to win the state championship.\nPeterson was the director of coaching and player development for USA Hockey, wrote its coaching manual for goaltenders, served as the goaltender coach on the United States men's team at the 1984 Winter Olympics, and was head coach of the team at Ice Hockey World Championships in 1985, 1986, and 1987. As head coach of the United States men's team at the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics, his teams finished in seventh and fourth place respectively. He also served as head coach of the United States men's junior team which won its first World Junior Championship medal with a bronze in 1986. He verbally sparred with media at the 1988 Winter Olympics, and was criticized for his coaching strategy, player selection, and gruff disposition.\nThe American Hockey Coaches Association recognized him with the John \"Snooks\" Kelley Founders Award in 1993. He was inducted into the Minnesota State High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame, and the Minneapolis Hockey Hall of Fame. USA Hockey annually gives the Dave Peterson Goalie of the Year to a junior ice hockey goaltender. Minnesota Hockey operates an annual Dave Peterson CCM High Performance Goalie Camp for high school students, and gives the Dave Peterson Award to a high school coach for leadership in developing hockey.\nEarly life and playing career.\nDavid Richard Peterson was born on January 5, 1931, in Superior, Wisconsin, to parents Hiram and Marie Peterson. Peterson was the son of a barber, his family had German, Irish, and Norwegian heritage, and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota, when he was two years old. As a youth, he played ice hockey outdoors at a local park, and also played baseball and American football.\nFirst playing as a goaltender as a freshman at Harding Senior High School in Saint Paul, Peterson then participated in the Minnesota state hockey championships during his senior year. His high school hockey team won the Region IV championship in 1948, then won the consolation championship at the Minnesota State High School League tournament, with Peterson winning two games as their goaltender.\nPeterson attended Hamline University to play football, and earned a teacher's degree. He was a top-scoring placekicker in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and also played offensive and defensive guard. He also played hockey at Hamline, and semi-professional hockey for per game.\nCoach John Mariucci signed Peterson to play for the Minneapolis Millers in the American Amateur Hockey League, during the 1951–52 season. Peterson returned to the Millers for the 1952–53 season, now in the Central Hockey League, and later played for the Minneapolis Bungalows in the Minnesota Hockey League during the 1954–55 season.\nMinnesota high school coaching.\nIn 1953, Peterson began teaching business and coaching basketball at Braham, Minnesota, then moved to Minneapolis North High School in 1954. After one season of coaching hockey at Minneapolis North, he became head coach of hockey and assistant coach of football at Southwest High School in 1955. He also served as the school's first soccer coach, and taught business classes including typing, shorthand, and bookkeeping. He coached hockey at Southwest High School from 1955 to 1982, and retired as a teacher in 1984.\nPeterson maximized practice time for the senior hockey team by maintaining an outdoor rink at Pershing Park with assistance from the players, rather than travelling longer distances to an indoor rink. He also made goaltender masks for high school players. Peterson's teams at Southwest High School qualified for 14 Minnesota State High School League tournaments, including one state championship, one second-place finish, two third-place results, and one consolation championship. His 1969–70 team had an undefeated season, and won the state championship versus Edina High School.\nUnited States national coaching.\nPeterson began working for the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS) in the mid-1970s, writing a manual on coaching goaltenders. He served as an assistant coach to Lou Vairo on the United States men's junior team at the 1983 World Junior Championships. Peterson later served as the goaltending coach for Vairo on the United States men's team which placed seventh in ice hockey at the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nAs head coach of the United States men's team at Ice Hockey World Championships, Peterson led them in 1985, 1986, and 1987. He also served as head coach of the United States men's junior team which won its first IIHF World Junior Championship medal with a bronze in 1986, and a fourth-place finish in 1987. He later served as head coach for the US men's national team at the 1987 Pravda Cup.\n1988 Winter Olympics.\nThe AHAUS chose Peterson as head coach of the United States men's team for ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics, when it desired a coach who was committed to the players and teaching, instead of furthering his own career. National team general manager Art Berglund stated, \"it doesn't matter whether it's high school, college or the pros, [Peterson] knows how to handle young men\", and that \"he's been part of our developmental program for years\". \"Chicago Tribune\" journalist Bob Verdi felt that Peterson was expected to be a father figure to the players, who played a schedule of exhibition games with the national team during the 1987–88 season. Peterson opted against last-minute additions of National Hockey League (NHL) players to the Olympic roster, as not to be unfair to the players who played the season.\nPeterson was criticized by media at the 1988 Winter Olympics for his coaching strategy, player selection, and gruff disposition. He defended his team's offensive-style system despite losses early in the Olympic tournament. He had a verbal exchange with Klauss Zaugg, a German-language reporter from Switzerland, who questioned the offensive style and lack of defense. After losing to the West Germany national team and being eliminated from medal contention, Zaugg stated, \"What is your system, Coach? You have no system\". Peterson called the international media \"dishonest, lazy and uninformed\", and also stated \"I have a tough time believing some of you have ever seen a hockey game\".\nPatrick Reusse wrote in the \"Star Tribune\", that Peterson deliberately took the role of a villain, to alleviate the pressure on the players. \"Sports Illustrated\" wrote that United States men's team \"massively underachieved\" with a seventh-place finish, and noted that twelve of the players were in the NHL within four years of the Olympics. \" Sports Illustrated\" also wrote that the exhibition season prior to the Olympics included games against college teams, which were easily defeated while falling into \"bad defensive habits\".\nAfter the 1988 Winter Olympics, Peterson worked as the director of coaching and player development for AHAUS. He conducted coaching clinics across the nation, and wanted to change the perception that a player had to go to a college-preparatory school in the Eastern United States for better coaching. He also advocated more quality coaching time for youths, and to have two practices per game played.\n1992 Winter Olympics.\nUSA Hockey chose Peterson as head coach for the United States men's team in ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics. Despite the previous criticism, Art Berglund felt that Peterson deserved a second chance, and stated that \"most of the criticism was unfair\". Selection committee chairman Bob Fleming, stated that Peterson was chosen because he had more continuous international experience. The choice of Peterson as coach was criticized by \"Sports Illustrated\", which wrote that teaching was Peterson's primary weakness, and reported that national team players compared the instruction they received from Peterson and his staff compared to coaching in college, instead of preparing them for a high-level games.\nThe exhibition schedule for the 1991–92 season included 60 games, more practice time, and higher-caliber opponents. Peterson coached the national team in 21 games versus NHL teams, 14 versus the Canada national team, and eight versus the Russia national team. USA Hockey also had Peterson coached on public relations and dealing with the media. Patrick Reusse wrote in the \"Star Tribune\", that Peterson later proved he could coach by leading a lesser-talented team to a fourth-place finish at the 1992 Winter Olympics. After the Olympics, Peterson worked as the director of coaching and player development for USA Hockey from 1992 to 1997.\nPersonal life.\nPeterson married Janice Amsden, a fellow Hamline physical education student, with whom he had four daughters. He was a recreational golfer, and umpired baseball games in Minnesota with fellow hockey coach Bob Johnson.\nPeterson had a heart attack on June 22, 1997, at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He subsequently had an angioplasty and recovered at home awaiting coronary artery bypass surgery. He died on July 17, 1997, following complications from the surgery at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. His remains were cremated and interred in Lakewood Cemetery in Minneapolis.\nHonors and legacy.\nPeterson received the John \"Snooks\" Kelley Founders Award from the American Hockey Coaches Association in 1993, in recognition of his contributions to coaching with the AHAUS and USA Hockey. He was inducted into the Minnesota State High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1996.\nAfter Peterson's death, USA Hockey president Walter Bush said, \"The sport of hockey has lost a true leader, a man who touched the lives of countless players, fellow coaches and friends during a remarkable career\". Since 2001, USA Hockey annually gives the Dave Peterson Goalie of the Year award to an outstanding junior ice hockey goaltender.\nPeterson was posthumously inducted into the Minneapolis Hockey Hall of Fame in 2016. Minnesota Hockey operates an annual Dave Peterson CCM High Performance Goalie Camp for high school students, and gives the Dave Peterson Award to a high school coach for leadership in developing hockey."

He is a World Youth Master and won a PDC Challenge Tour tournament in 2021. He also qualified two times for the WDF World Darts Championship.\nCareer.\nAfter winning the World Youth Masters in 2002, hopes for a strong career for McDonald were high. A year later he was in the men's field for the first time, but didn't make it past the second round. In 2006, McDonald made his UK Open debut, where he was eliminated after winning in the second round. McDonald took part in the PDC Pro Tour, which was still open at the time, on several occasions, where he once reached the Last 16 phase.\nIn 2021, McDonald played in the PDC Q-School and then the 2021 PDC Challenge Tour series. Here he celebrated his greatest career success, because he was able to win the fifth event of the year. In November, McDonald then secured the title at the Irish Classic, after a quarter-final at the Denmark Open. 15 years after his last appearance at the UK Open, he celebrated his comeback there in 2022, but conceded a whitewash against compatriot Jamie Clark right at the start. McDonald's consistent results saw him participate in the 2022 WDF World Darts Championship, where he lost to Dave Parletti in the first round by 1–2 in sets.\nDuring the 2022 Winmau World Masters he advanced to the third round, where he lost to eventual winner Wesley Plaisier by 0–5 in legs. On 13 December he won the qualification for the 2023 WDF World Darts Championship."

The state of women's rights in Qatar and a British tourism executive hired to promote the country dying under suspicious circumstances have also been sources of controversy.\nIn a December 2021 interview with \"Al Jazeera\", FIFA's secretary-general Fatma Samoura said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its human rights responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations.\nMigrant workers.\nIndentured servitude.\nKafala system.\nOne of the most discussed issues of the Qatar World Cup was the treatment of workers hired to build the infrastructure. Most Qatari nationals avoid doing manual work or low-skilled jobs. They are given preference in the workplace. In May 2014, Qatar announced plans to abolish the kafala system, but implementation was delayed until 2016, and even if the promised reforms are implemented, employers would still have considerable power over workers (for example, a proposed requirement that wages must be paid into a designated bank account would not cover labourers paid in cash).\nHuman Rights Watch and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) state that the kafala system leaves migrants vulnerable to systematic abuse. Workers could not change jobs or even leave the country without their sponsor's permission. In November 2013, Amnesty International reported \"serious exploitation\", including workers having to sign false statements that they had received their wages in order to regain their passports from their sponsors' custody. An investigation by \"The Guardian\" in the same year claimed had their identity papers taken away from them, were compelled to perform forced labor, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them effectively slaves. \"The Guardian\" also reported that companies refused to pay salaries and administer necessary worker ID permits, rendering the workers illegal aliens and forcing them to stay. The report stated that there was evidence to suggest that workers face exploitation and abuse as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO).\nBy 2015, Michael van Praag, president of the Royal Dutch Football Association, requested the FIFA Executive Committee to pressure Qatar over the allegations to ensure better workers' conditions. He also stated that a new vote on the attribution of the World Cup to Qatar would have to take place if the corruption allegations were to be proved. In March 2016, Amnesty International accused Qatar of using forced labour, forcing the employees to live in poor conditions, and withholding their wages and passports. It also accused FIFA of failing to act against the human rights abuses. Migrant workers told Amnesty about verbal abuse and threats they received after complaining about not being paid for up to several months. Nepali workers were denied leave to visit their family after the 2015 Nepal earthquake.\nIn August 2022, Qatari authorities arrested and deported over 60 migrant workers who protested about non-payment of wages by their employer, Al Bandary International Group, a major construction and hospitality firm. Some of the demonstrators, from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Egypt and the Philippines, had not been paid for seven months. London-based labour rights body Equidem said most were sent home. Qatar's labour ministry said it was paying Al Bandary workers and taking further action against the company - already under investigation for failing to pay wages.\nIn September 2022, Amnesty published the results of a poll of over 17,000 football fans from 15 countries which showed 73% supported FIFA compensating migrant workers in Qatar for human rights violations. FIFA responded with a statement noting progress on Qatar's migrant worker policies, adding \"FIFA will continue its efforts to enable remediation for workers who may have been adversely impacted in relation to FIFA World Cup-related work in accordance with its Human Rights Policy and responsibilities under relevant international standards.\"\nOn 24 November 2022, during the tournament, the European Parliament adopted a resolution requesting FIFA to help compensate the families of migrant workers who died in Qatar, and for Qatar conduct a full human rights investigation. Before the tournament was over, several individuals involved in the European Parliament had been arrested on charges of colluding in organised crime with Qatar, including aiming to improve Qatar's human rights reputation ahead of the World Cup.\nLabour reforms.\nIn October 2017, the ITUC said that Qatar had signed an agreement to improve the situation of more than two million migrant workers in the country. According to the ITUC, the agreement provided for substantial reforms in the labour system, including ending the kafala system, and would positively affect the general situation of workers, especially those working on 2022 FIFA World Cup infrastructure projects. The workers would no longer need their employer's permission to leave the country or change their jobs. Amnesty International have questioned whether Qatar would complete the promised labour reforms before the start of the World Cup, a sentiment that FIFA backed. Amnesty International found that abuses were still occurring despite the nation taking some steps to improve labour rights. Law No. 13 of 2018 abolished exit visas for about 95 percent of migrant workers. On 30 April 2018, the ILO opened its first project office in Qatar to monitor and support the implementation of the new labour laws. In February 2019, Amnesty International said Qatar was falling short on promised labour reforms before the start of the World Cup, a sentiment that FIFA backed. Amnesty also found that abuses were still occurring. In May 2019, an investigation by the UK's \"Daily Mirror\" newspaper discovered that some of the 28,000 workers on the stadiums were being paid 750 Qatari riyals per month, equivalent to £190 per month or 99 pence an hour for a typical 48-hour week. In October 2019, the ILO said that Qatar had taken steps towards upholding the rights of migrant workers.\nIn April 2020, the government of Qatar provided $824 million to pay the wages of migrant workers in quarantine or undergoing treatment for COVID-19. In August 2020, the Qatari government announced a monthly minimum wage for all workers of 1,000 riyals (US$275), an increase from the previous temporary minimum wage of 750 riyals a month. The new laws went into effect in March 2021. The ILO said \"Qatar is the first country in the region to introduce a non-discriminatory minimum wage, which is a part of a series of historical reforms of the country's labour laws,\" but the campaign group Migrant Rights said the new minimum wage was too low to meet migrant workers' need with Qatar's high cost of living. In addition, employers are obligated to pay 300 riyals for food and 500 riyals for accommodation, if they do not provide employees with these directly. The No Objection Certificate was removed so that employees can change jobs without consent of the current employer. A Minimum Wage Committee was also formed to check on the implementation. These reforms removed the kafala system and a contractual system was introduced – the European Union's \"Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2021\" noted Qatar's labour law reforms had incorporated non-discriminatory minimum wage systems and removal of the Kafala system in 2021.\nAt the March 2022 FIFA Congress in Doha, Lise Klaveness—head of the Norwegian Football Federation—criticised the organisation for having awarded the World Cup to Qatar, citing the various controversies surrounding the tournament. She argued that \"in 2010 World Cups were awarded by FIFA in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality, democracy: the core interests of football were not in the starting XI until many years later. These basic rights were pressured onto the field as substitutes by outside voices. FIFA has addressed these issues but there's still a long way to go.\" Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of Qatar 2022, criticised her remarks for ignoring the country's recent labour reforms. In May 2022, Amnesty accused FIFA of looking the other way while thousands of migrants worked in conditions \"amounting to forced labor\", arguing that FIFA should have required labour protections as a condition of hosting.\nShortly before the tournament began, France 24 broadcast a report titled \"The plight of migrant workers in Qatar\", adding more details to the controversy and how many reform laws have not been followed. In June 2023, Human Rights Watch said it \"acknowledges and applauds\" reforms in the migrant sector made by Qatar during the World Cup, including the creation of a department for Occupational Health and Safety.\nConditions of migrant workers.\nThe issue of migrant workers' rights attracted greater attention once the World Cup was awarded to Qatar, with the 2013 investigation by \"The Guardian\" claiming that many workers were denied food and water.\nAfter visiting a labour camp in 2012, Sharan Burrows of the ITUC stated that \"If two years on [since the award of the 2022 World Cup] the [Qatari] Government has not done the fundamentals, they have no commitment to human rights\". The Qatar 2022 Committee said: \"Our commitment is to change working conditions in order to ensure a lasting legacy of improved worker welfare. We are aware this cannot be done overnight. But the 2022 FIFA World Cup is acting as a catalyst for improvements in this regard.\" A video shown to labour rights groups in 2013 showed men living in dilapidated labour camps under unsanitary conditions.\nIn November 2017, the ILO started a three-year technical cooperation programme with Qatar to improve working conditions and labour rights. Qatar introduced new labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights: Law No. 15 of 2017 introduced clauses on maximum working hours and constitutional rights to annual leave.\nDeaths of migrant workers.\n\"The Guardian\" estimated that, by the time the competition would be held, without reforms of the kafala system, out of the 2 million-strong migrant workforce up to 4,000 workers could die due to lax safety and other causes. These claims were based upon the fact that 522 Nepalese workers and over 700 Indian workers had died since 2010, when Qatar's bid as World Cup's host had been won, about 250 Indian workers dying each year. The Indian government said the number of deaths could be considered quite normal based on the figure of half a million Indians working in Qatar.\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported in June 2015 the ITUC's claim that over 1,200 workers had died while working on infrastructure and real-estate projects related to the World Cup, and the Qatar Government's counter-claim that none had. The BBC later reported that this often-cited figure of 1,200 workers having died in World Cup construction in Qatar between 2011 and 2013 is not correct, and that the 1,200 number is instead representing deaths from all Indians and Nepalese working in Qatar, not just of those workers involved in the preparation for the World Cup, and not just of construction workers.\nIn 2019, the Planning and Statistics Authority of the State of Qatar reported that 15,021 non-Qataris had died between 2010 and 2019 in its Vital Statistics Annual Bulletin - Births &amp; Deaths 2019.\nIn February 2021, another investigative report published by \"The Guardian\" used data from embassies and national foreign employment offices to estimate a death toll of 6,500 migrant workers since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar. The figures used by \"The Guardian\" did not include occupation or place of work so deaths could not be definitively associated with the World Cup construction programme, but \"a very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup.\"\nIn a September 2021 report, Amnesty criticised Qatar for failing to investigate migrant workers' deaths.\nOn 8 September 2020, Qatar introduced reforms that apply to all workers, regardless of their nationality; the main reform was wage protection. Qatar introduced a national minimum wage of 1000Qatari riyals. Additionally, workers who are housed by their employers must be provided with accommodation and food, or accommodation and a food allowance of 300riyals on top of their wage. The wage protection system included measures to make sure workers knew their entitlements and enforce them.\nInteractions with foreign companies.\nIn 2015, a crew of four journalists from the BBC were arrested and held for two days after they attempted to report on the condition of workers in the country. The reporters had been invited to visit the country as guests of the Government of Qatar. At the start of the tournament, the BBC refused to broadcast Qatar's 2022 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, instead showing a panel discussion led by host Gary Lineker delivering a critique of Qatar's records on LGBT rights and treatment of migrant workers. Jim Waterson of \"The Guardian\" commented that the Qatari authorities \"probably hoped [the opening ceremony] would be the moment when the global media finally focused on football rather than human rights\".\nIn March 2021, Hendriks Graszoden, the turf supplier for the 2006 World Cup and for the European Championships in 2008 and 2016, refused to supply Qatar with World Cup turf. According to company spokesperson Gerdien Vloet, one reason for this decision was the accusations of human rights abuses.\nOn September 28, 2022, Danish sportswear company Hummel unveiled Denmark's \"toned down\" kits for the tournament in protest of Qatar's human rights record. One of these kits includes a black alternate kit that represents \"the color of mourning\", which references the dispute between Hummel and World Cup organisers in Qatar in which Hummel claimed that thousands of migrant workers died during the construction of the venues. Hummel said in their statement on their official Instagram:\nSinger Dua Lipa denied speculations that she would be performing in Qatar, stating in her Instagram Stories post that she looked \"forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it won the right to host the World Cup.\" Rod Stewart, meanwhile, claimed he had refused over $1 million to perform at the tournament.\nDefenses of Qatar and FIFA.\nIn March 2022, FIFA president Gianni Infantino claimed in an interview that the Gulf nation is being progressive in terms of the labour rights and migrant rights issues that prevailed previously, adding \"I am pleased to see the strong commitment from the Qatari authorities to ensure the reforms are fully implemented across the labour market, leaving a lasting legacy of the FIFA World Cup long after the event, and benefiting migrant workers in the host country in the long term.\"\nIn a news conference preceding the tournament on 19 November 2022, Infantino defended criticism of Qatar from the West as hypocritical, stating that \"I think for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\" He asked, \"how many of these European companies who earn millions and millions from Qatar or other countries in the region—billions every year—how many of them have addressed migrant worker rights? I have the answer: none of them, because if they change the legislation it means less profits. But we did. And FIFA generated much, much, much less than any of these companies, from Qatar.\"\nAmid popular criticism, political commentary magazine \"The Economist\" also provided a defence for FIFA's choice, stating that Qatar was \"a more suitable country to host a big sporting event\" than both China and Russia, who hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2018 World Cup respectively, and who both have arguably worse human rights records. Moreover, it added that \"Western criticism\" failed to \"distinguish between truly repugnant regimes and merely flawed ones\", and that many \"indignant pundits\" simply sounded as if they did \"not like Muslims or rich people\".\nDeath of Marc Bennett.\nMarc Bennett was a British travel advisor who died under mysterious circumstances in Doha. Bennett was employed by the Qatar Airways company Discover Qatar to promote the image of Qatar following the nation's selection as the host of the World Cup. After leaving the job and showing interest in a rival Saudi company, Bennett was arrested and tortured. He was found hanged in his hotel room on 25 December 2019. Following his death, Qatar Airways reported that he was arrested for stealing company secrets. The Qatari authorities said that he killed himself, Qatar Airways said this was unrelated to his work because he was a popular and valued former employee. Bennett's family dispute both stories; a British coroner did not record the death as suicide.\nWomen's rights.\nDiscrimination against women was also criticized. Women in Qatar must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.\nIn February 2022, a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee working as an economist was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape. However, the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case against the Organizing Committee employee was dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar. Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision to close the case."

Often described as the \"Little Augusta\" of North Texas, the course is located just west of Downtown Dallas and nestled between the Stevens Park Estates and Kessler Park neighborhoods.\nHistory.\nStevens Park golf course was opened in 1924 in Oak Cliff as the second municipal course in Dallas. Park golf course was originally designed by Jack Burke Sr. (father of 1956 Masters champion Jack Burke Jr.) in 1924 with 9 holes and later expanded to 18 holes.\nIn 2011, the course underwent an $8 million renovation by Fort Worth-based Colligan Golf Design. The complete renovation produced new routing with new tee boxes, fairways, greens, and 38 new sand bunkers. Infrastructure for irrigation and cart-paths were a $4.5 million part of the renovation budget.\nAs part of the renovation, trees were added throughout the golf course along with rosebushes to enhance the beauty of the course and compliment the surrounding Kessler Park neighborhood. 2021 review from Dallas city hall showed over 42,000 rounds of golf with over $1 million in revenue beneficial to the city with the citation from GolfWeek 2014 listing Stevens Park among the 50 best municipal golf courses in the United States.\nIn 2017, design critic Andy Johnson wrote a review of the property highlighting six holes.\nStevens Park golf course was added to the National Register on June 17, 1994 as part of the Kessler Park Historic District."

        "text": "The 2023 World Baseball Classic championship was the final of the 2023 World Baseball Classic, the fifth edition of the World Baseball Classic, a men's international baseball tournament sanctioned by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) in partnership with World Baseball Classic Inc. (WBCI). The game was played on March 21, 2023, at LoanDepot Park in Miami, Florida, United States, between hosts and defending champion United States and two-time champion Japan. Japan won 3–2 to earn a record-extending third World Baseball Classic title. Shohei Ohtani won the most valuable player award.\nUnlike in 2009, 2013 and 2017, the 2023 U.S. lineup attracted distinguished players, which some commentators claimed contributed to generating excitement for the final. The U.S. general manager Tony Reagins credited Mike Trout, a three-time major league MVP, for committing to the team early (in July 2022) which made it easier to convince others to join.\nThe championship game was one of the most watched games in baseball history with the game attracting an average television viewership of 5.2 million people in the U.S. and a reported 62 million television viewers in Japan representing a total of 42.4% of households in the country despite the game taking place at 8 am JST. The game was widely praised as an instant classic, with the ending duel between team captains Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani being considered as one of the greatest moments in the history of the sport.\nRoad to the championship.\nThe United States was the victor of the previous edition of the WBC, in 2017 defeating Japan in the semi-final round. Japan won the 2006 and 2009 editions of the WBC. \nIn 2023, Japan won all four games in Pool B, which it hosted at the Tokyo Dome. They then defeated Italy in the quarterfinals. Japan defeated Mexico in the semifinals to advance to the championship.\nThe United States went 3–1 in Pool C, advancing as the pool's runner-up behind Mexico, who they lost to in an upset 11–5 result. The United States defeated Venezuela in the quarterfinals and Cuba in the semifinals.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nGame.\nSummary.\nThe starting pitchers for the championship game were Shōta Imanaga for Japan and Merrill Kelly for the United States. Trea Turner hit a solo home run for the United States off of Imanaga in the top of the second inning. Turner tied Lee Seung-yuop (South Korea) in the 2006 tournament for the most home-runs in a single WBC tournament. Munetaka Murakami tied the game with a solo home run off of Kelly in the bottom of the second inning. Japan continued the inning by loading the bases with singles from Kazuma Okamoto and Sosuke Genda and a walk to Yuhei Nakamura. After Aaron Loup relieved Kelly for the United States, Lars Nootbaar hit a RBI ground out. In the bottom of the fourth inning, Kazuma Okamoto hit a solo home run for Japan off of Kyle Freeland to give Japan its final run.\nBoth teams then remained scoreless until the top of the eighth inning, when Kyle Schwarber hit a solo home run for the United States off of Yu Darvish. Leading 3–2 in the ninth inning, Japan used their designated hitter, Shohei Ohtani, to record the save. \nDuring the final at-bat, in a moment often described as storybook-like, Ohtani struck out Mike Trout, fellow renowned teammate of the Los Angeles Angels, to win the tournament for Japan. Ohtani threw a 87.2 mph slider on a full count to secure the victory, the previous two strikes being down-the-middle swung-on 100 mph fastballs. \nOhtani won the WBC's most valuable player award after batting .435 with a 1.86 earned run average pitching. Following the final, Takuya Mitsuda, the author and illustrator of the \"Major\" baseball manga that was adapted into an anime series, created a commemorative illustration featuring Ohtani alongside \"Major\" protagonist Goro Honda (Shigeno) that was published in \"Sports Nippon\". \"Major\" fans had compared Ohtani's duel with Trout to Goro's duel with Joe Gibson Jr. in one scene.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Box /&gt;&lt;section end=Box /&gt;"

Under the rules in effect at the time, three races in the discipline were required to award a crystal globe to the discipline champion (and, in a change, fewer than three races might still be sufficient, after no crystal globes were handed out in the discipline for the three previous seasons).\n2016 overall champion Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland won the super-combined but then lost the season combined championship (and the crystal globe) to her Swiss teammate Wendy Holdener, who placed first and second in the two Alpine combineds. However, Gut's third-place finish in the last race of the season, which was run in reverse order (slalom first, then Super-G), was sufficient for her to clinch the overall title for the season. \nAt this time, combined races were not included in the season finals, which were held in 2016 in St. Moritz, Switzerland."

        "text": "The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, officially the Mundial de Clubes FIFA 25, is the planned 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, an international club soccer competition organized by FIFA. The tournament is scheduled to be played in the United States from June 15 to July 13, 2025. It is planned to be the first under an expanded format with 32 teams, including the winners of the four previous continental championships.\nManchester City is the defending champion.\nBackground and format.\nSince its return from hiatus in 2005, the FIFA Club World Cup had been held annually in December and limited to the winners of continental club competitions. As early as late 2016, FIFA president Gianni Infantino suggested expanding the Club World Cup to 32 teams beginning in 2019 and rescheduling it to June/July to be more balanced and more attractive to broadcasters and sponsors. In late 2017, FIFA discussed proposals to expand the competition to 24 teams and have it be played every four years by 2021, replacing the FIFA Confederations Cup. The expanded format and schedule of Club World Cup, to be played in June and July 2021, was confirmed at the March 2019 FIFA Council meeting in Miami. China was appointed as host in October 2019, but the 2021 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn June 23, 2023, FIFA confirmed that the United States will host the 2025 tournament as a prelude to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The host cities for the tournament remain undecided. The 32 teams will be divided into eight groups of four teams with the top two teams in each group qualifying to the knockout stage. The format will be the same that was used in the FIFA World Cup between 1998 and 2022, with the exception of a third-place play-off.\nIn January 2024, it was reported that the tournament would take place on the East Coast to be closer to European broadcasters and viewers while also avoiding conflict with the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, which will also take place primarily in the United States around the same time but on the West Coast.\nSlot allocation.\nOn February 14, 2023, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation for the 2025 tournament based on a \"set of objective metrics and criteria\". UEFA was awarded the most slots with twelve, while CONMEBOL was given the second most with six. The AFC, CAF, and CONCACAF were all given four slots, while the OFC and the host association were given one slot each. On March 14, 2023, the FIFA Council approved the key principles of the access list for the tournament. The principles are as follows, considering competitions completed during a four-year period from 2021 to 2024:\nIf a club wins two or more seasons of its confederation's top club competition, additional teams will be determined by a club ranking of the four-year period. A restriction of two clubs per association will be applied, with an exception for champion clubs if more than two clubs from the same association win their confederation's top club competition. The calculation method for the four-year club rankings within each confederation will be based on sporting criteria during seasons completed between 2021 and 2024, and will be finalized after consultation with confederations and stakeholders.\nQualified teams.\nThe following teams have qualified for the tournament:\nCriticism.\nThe proposed expansion was criticized by FIFPRO, a global union of professional players, as well as the World Leagues Forum, which represents professional leagues; both organizations raised concerns about player welfare due to the added fixtures in an already congested playing calendar. The Spanish top division league, La Liga, also criticized the plan and said in a statement that it would consider legal action to block the expansion. Many clubs and national federations have opposed its scheduling, accusing FIFA of prioritizing money over the health of the players. The addition of the new FIFA Intercontinental Cup tournament will allegedly generate an overload of competitions and further put the health of the players at risk."

        "text": "The 2023 Monaco Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2023) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 28 May 2023, at the Circuit de Monaco in the Principality of Monaco. It was the sixth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship.\nThe race, which was affected by rain during the middle stages, was won by polesitter Max Verstappen, ahead of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon, the latter receiving his third podium in his Formula One career after the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 26–28 May 2023. It was the sixth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship, after the previously scheduled Emilia Romagna Grand Prix was cancelled due to floods in the region.\nDue to this, Mercedes, a team with pending upgrades intended to be introduced during the Imola race, had to implement them during the Monaco race. The team's car, which, going into the weekend, still utilised the \"zero-pod\" design introduced in the previous year's car, was brought into Monaco with an upgrade that reintroduced the sidepods. In addition, the Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin and Alpine teams sported upgrade packages for the weekend.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nGoing into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the World Drivers' Championship with 119 points, 14 points ahead of his teammate Sergio Pérez in second, and 44 ahead of Fernando Alonso in third. Red Bull Racing, with 224 points, led the Constructors' Championship from Aston Martin and Mercedes, who were second and third with 102 and 96 points, respectively.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4, and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held for the event. The first free practice session was held on 26 May 2023, at 13:30 local time (UTC+2). Carlos Sainz Jr. topped the session ahead of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton. The second free practice session was held on 26 May 2023, at 17:00 local time (UTC+2). Max Verstappen topped the session ahead of Charles Leclerc and Sainz. The third free practice session was held on 27 May 2023, at 12:30 local time (UTC+2). Verstappen again topped the session ahead of Sergio Pérez and Lance Stroll.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on 27 May 2023, at 16:00 local time (UTC+2).\nQualifying report.\nMax Verstappen set the quickest time across all three sessions. During the first session, Carlos Sainz Jr.'s time on his first lap was deleted due to exceeding track limits. Sergio Pérez crashed out of the opening St. Devote corner, red-flagging the session and damaging his car. Due to this, he started in the last position. Due to the narrow nature of the track, his car had to be craned out; the second time such had happened during the weekend following Lewis Hamilton during the third free practice session, which was red-flagged. Pérez's teammate Verstappen tapped the wall following the restart, but no damage was reported. By the end of the first session, Logan Sargeant, the Haas duo of Kevin Magnussen and Nico Hülkenberg, Zhou Guanyu, and Pérez found themselves knocked out.\nDuring the second session, Lando Norris found himself hitting the wall at the Tabac chicane, inflicting minor damage to his car. However, he found himself progressing through the third session; his teammate Oscar Piastri would not. Joining him were Nyck de Vries, Alexander Albon, Lance Stroll and Valtteri Bottas.\nDuring the third and final session, Norris would go out later after quick repairs to his car, though he could not beat Yuki Tsunoda (who would qualify ninth) to the line. The session proved to be the tightest of the weekend as Verstappen set the fastest lap during the closing minutes of the session. Just before the session ended and before Verstappen set his pole time, Fernando Alonso (in second), Esteban Ocon (in fourth), and Charles Leclerc (in third with a brief investigation for impeding Norris) all set the fastest lap. Leclerc was dissatisfied with the result, saying he \"struggled a lot with the car\", while Verstappen said that \"in qualifying, you need to go all out and risk it all\". Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton, Pierre Gasly and George Russell made up sixth, seventh and eighth position respectively. This is Verstappen's first Monaco Grand Prix pole position. With penalties applied, this is the third time Ocon achieved a starting position of third following the 2017 Italian Grand Prix and 2018 Belgian Grand Prix.\nLeclerc was dropped to sixth after the stewards investigated his impeding of Norris earlier in Q3.\nQualifying classification.\nNotes\nRace.\nThe race was held on 28 May 2023, at 15:00 local time (UTC+2).\nRace report.\nFollowing the formation lap, George Russell made a mistake with his start but was not penalised. As the race began, Nico Hülkenberg made contact with Logan Sargeant, which granted the Haas driver a five-second penalty. Sergio Pérez made an early stop to swap to the hards. By lap 14, Carlos Sainz Jr. ran off the Nouvelle chicane, his front wing making contact with Esteban Ocon's right-rear. Sainz decided to continue on. Valtteri Bottas jumped Alexander Albon, with the latter granting himself a new set of hard tyres. His teammate Sargeant would follow, first on hards, and again on softs. By lap 30, Lewis Hamilton put on fresh hards and came out behind Russell.\nBy lap 20, Ferrari engineers told Sainz to come in to overtake Ocon, though he was then told to stay out. The order was repeated six laps later, with Ferrari once again telling him to stay out afterwards. Sainz eventually boxed by lap 33 with new mediums, rejoining in seventh and behind Ocon. Sainz was frustrated with the strategy, criticising it over team radio. Soon, Pérez came in with new mediums and a new front wing, coming out in last. Lance Stroll reported damage during lap 38, having made contact with Kevin Magnussen. Charles Leclerc went in for fresh mediums, dropping him to eighth; Pierre Gasly failed to overcut Leclerc with new fresh mediums. Lando Norris came in for hards, dropping him a position lower.\nA threat of rain was reported during the race; Russell reported drops by turn 3. The first two drivers to switch to intermediates were Stroll and Bottas; soon Zhou Guanyu and Albon followed. While everyone else went for intermediate tyres, Fernando Alonso decided to use medium tyres; he switched to inters the following lap, with Ferrari deciding to double stack. Sainz spun twice, though did not hit the barriers at high speeds. Stroll, however, received damage to his car following his front wing lodging itself underneath his front wheels. Max Verstappen grazed the wall at Portier while on mediums, but saved the car from retirement. Magnussen took full wets, having had hards as the rain began; Pérez would utilise the compound later on. However, Magnussen crashed out with damage to his front wing. His mechanics, unprepared for such a change, had to prepare it on the spot, lengthening his time in the pits. Meanwhile, Sargeant hit the wall at the hairpin, though he recovered the car. Magnussen would go off on turn one, and Stroll went into an escape road at turn five; Russell followed Stroll into the escape road, only to be hit by Pérez. Meanwhile, Hülkenberg was given a 10 second penalty for serving the first one incorrectly, Gasly was shown a black and white flag for exceeding track limits, Pérez swapped to inters, and Yuki Tsunoda reported problems with his brakes.\nThe running order on the top three did not change throughout the race. Verstappen's victory marks his second Monaco Grand Prix victory. Alonso finished second; his former teammate Ocon finished third and was awarded driver of the day; the first time a French driver was on the podium in Monaco since Olivier Panis in 1996, and his first podium since the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix, which was also his first win. Hamilton took the fastest lap. A five-second penalty was given to Russell after an unsafe rejoin, though his final position was not affected.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

        "title": "2000 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2000 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 63rd season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2000–01 began on July 15, 2000, and the host school for the season was also UST.\nThe Tigers ended the double round-robin eliminations in joint fourth place with the UE Red Warriors, with eight wins and six losses. They won their playoff match for the fourth and final semifinal slot over the Warriors, 65–61. UST has qualified in each of the UAAP seasons' semifinal series since the Final Four format took effect in 1994.\nFour of their games went into overtime, with three resulting to wins over the UP Fighting Maroons, the Adamson Falcons and the NU Bulldogs, and one ending on a loss to the FEU Tamaraws, all in the second round of eliminations.\nThey had an average winning margin of 6.4 points and an average losing margin of 6.5 points.\nThe Growling Tigers once again faced the De La Salle Green Archers in the Final Four on a twice-to-win disadvantage, and went unsuccessful with a 62–65 defeat.\nRoster changes.\nThe Tigers lost team captain Gelo Velasco to graduation, as well as their defense specialist in forward Jeff Valeriano. Among UST's new players are the rookie forward Christian Luanzon, who is coming off back-to-back championships with Saint Stephen's High School in the Metro Manila Tiong Lian Basketball Association, and returning guard Apol Tuadles.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nThe Growling Tigers joined the inaugural season of the six-team National Basketball League in May. Games were played in a double round-robin home and away format, and were televised on ABS-CBN.\nUST failed to make it to the semifinals of the Father Martin Cup Invitational tournament, even as they tied the UE Red Warriors, the PCU Dolphins and the San Sebastian Stags with 7–1 records due to an inferior quotient.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and all of UST's games were televised on Studio 23.\nSummary.\nEven without the already-graduated Gelo Velasco, the Growling Tigers remained formidable for Season 63 due to their near-intact lineup that featured the strong front line of Marvin Ortiguerra, Gilbert Lao, Mel Latoreno, and Alwyn Espiritu. They also had their shifty wing men in Cyrus Baguio, Niño Gelig, Emmerson Oreta, and Derick Hubalde, who all had gained added experience while playing in the Philippine Basketball League in the off-season.\nTheir runner-up finish from the past year has made them contenders, and the players' overconfidence and complacency has gotten head coach Aric del Rosario concerned. Another issue was the various injuries that his starters incurred in the buildup to the opening of the season. Latoreno was expected to be out for six weeks due to a stretched cartilage, while Lao had surgery on his lower back and needed time for recuperation. Hubalde also fractured a finger on his left hand, and Oreta had been suffering from a sprained ankle.\nFirst round.\nThe Growling Tigers' error-filled plays allowed FEU to erect an 11-point 53–42 lead early in the second half. Latoreno was called for an unsportsmanlike foul on FEU's Rysal Castro, as his elbow hit and bloodied Castro's mouth. UST was trailing by two at 27–29 with 3:43 left in the first half, but the Tamaraws went on an 8–2 run to close the half with an eight-point lead.\nThe Tigers defeated Adamson, 67–53 as their three-point shooting found their range during the game. They began the game with 13 unanswered points and ended the half on a 30–23 lead.\nOreta fired five of the Tigers' 10 three-pointers to lead the team with 20 points. Hubalde chipped in 9 points, with all of his points coming from beyond the arc. UST led by as high as 21 points in the second half at 53–32, but the Falcons went on a 12–5 rally to come within 14 at 58–44.\nRookie guard Dondon Villamin came off the bench to orchestrate the Growling Tigers' plays to a come-from-behind win over the Ateneo Blue Eagles. The first half ended with UST trailing, 27–39, and after the halftime huddle, with head coach Aric del Rosario lashing out at his players, the boys erupted with an 18–8 run to begin the second half.\nEmmerson Oreta converted his and-1 to give UST the lead at 51–50 as they limited Ateneo to only five field goals in the second half, with the Eagles going scoreless for seven minutes. Four of the Tigers scored in double figures with Alwyn Espiritu finishing with 13 points. Oreta and Cyrus Baguio contributed 12 points apiece, while Niño Gelig added 11.\nUST relied on their big men, Alwyn Espiritu and Mel Latoreno to take advantage of the NU Bulldogs' shorter defenders as they attacked the shaded lane for a 70–63 win. Latoreno and Derick Hubalde topscored for the Tigers with 15 points apiece.\nThe Tigers made 8 out of their 10 free throws at endgame to defeat the UP Fighting Maroons, 49–45. UST had trailed for almost the entire game, until they tightened up on defense to gain the upperhand. Already up by 2 points at 47–45 in the final 12 seconds, they forced a turnover on the Maroons' Rob Bornancin, as he was made to pass to teammate Edrick Ferrer. The Tigers scored the last basket for the win. Marvin Ortiguerra and Alwyn Espiritu topscored with 14 and 10 points respectively.\nSecond round.\nUST's first round of eliminations ended with four wins against three losses. With the exception of the Ateneo Blue Eagles, who won the Father Martin Cup in the preseason, all their other wins were against teams with losing records. The Tigers have shown inconsistency in their losses due to the absence of a playmaker after former team captain Gelo Velasco's departure from the team. The one advantage that the Tigers have with their inconsistency is in their offense, as no player in their roster made it to the top ten in scoring averages. This trend has left their opponents guessing in terms of defense, as to who they will need to guard more or switch with a double team on.\nCyrus Baguio missed both his free throws with time running out in regulation, sending the game into overtime with UP at 64–all. In the extra period, Baguio added nine to his total 19 points, pulling UST to a five-point 69–64 lead. The Maroons came to within two points, but they sent Baguio to the line anew after a foul from Bornancin was called. He split his charity for a 75–72 score, with 5.7 seconds remaining. UP's Mike Bravo went for a running three-point shot, but missed, giving the Tigers their fifth win in eight games. Derick Hubalde and Mel Latoreno chipped in 15 and 11 points as they joined Baguio in scoring double-digits for UST.\nThe Tigers blew hot and cold throughout the game and were only saved by Adamson's missed free throws in the dying seconds of the overtime period.\nOreta's 1 of 2 from the charity stripe gave the Tigers a three-point cushion with seven seconds remaining in regulation, but Baguio fouled the Falcons' Joshua Ramirez, who was going for a three-point shot.\nUST was trailing, 37–42 in the last three minutes of regulation time, until Baguio sparked a four-point run that included a difficult twisting undergoal basket to tie the score at 42–all in the last 23 seconds. Marvin Ortiguerra towed his team to a 54–51 overtime lead with his back-to-back mid-range jumpers.\nDondon Villamin and Derick Hubalde were unable to finish the game when they suffered separate injuries. Villamin dislocated his shoulder, while Hubalde twisted his ankle during one of the plays.\nUE placed the game under protest with the Warriors' coach Itoy Esguerra claiming a three-point shot by Baguio should have been nullified because the halftime buzzer has sounded before the ball was released.\nThe Warriors' rookie James Yap fired a three-pointer to pull his team within one at 56–57 in the last 24 seconds. A miss by Oreta in the next play gave the Warriors the last possession and a chance to steal the game, but Yap missed a 14-foot jumper and his teammate Ronald Tubid, who had gotten the rebound was called for stepping out of bounds.\nCyrus Baguio led the team with 24 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists. He scored 20 points in the first half.\nUST was held scoreless by the FEU Tamaraws in the last seven minutes and were forced into overtime, where they scored only two points, eventually losing, 57–61. Glenn Manching converted a three-point basket to pull the Tigers to a seven-point 55–48 lead late in the second half before his team went on a scoring drought. FEU's Edwin Bacani had the chance to send the Tamaraws to victory at the end of regulation, but he missed his jumper, ten feet away from the goal. The Tigers got the rebound, with Niño Gelig attempting and missing his shot as time expired.\nThe Tigers were tentative in their offense throughout the game, as evindenced in their zero fast break points and only five free throw attempts.\nThe Growling Tigers' 59–60 loss to Ateneo pushed them down to a 7–6 record and put them in danger of missing the Final Four, as the UE Red Warriors, sporting a 7–5 record were looking to overtake them by winning their last two games of the eliminations.\nCyrus Baguio was fouled and sent to the free throw line in the closing seconds of the game. He converted his first foul shot to give the Tigers the lead at 59–58, but he missed the second charity which was rebounded by the Eagles' Enrico Villanueva, who then made a pass to teammate Wesley Gonzales for a fast break. Gonzales, in turn passed the ball to Magnum Membrere for the game-winning shot.\nThe Tigers were trailing, 66–69 with six seconds left, when Emmerson Oreta drilled his sixth three-point shot to send the game into overtime.\nThey limited the Bulldogs to a single point in the extra period, as they forced four errors on them. Niño Gelig earlier scored a triple to push UST up by three at 72–69. The game went down to a battle of free throws until time expired, with the Tigers winning, 75–70.\nOreta topscored for the Tigers with 20 points, with Marvin Ortiguerra and Cyrus Baguio adding 15 and 12 respectively.\nPlayoffs.\nCyrus Baguio, Marvin Ortiguerra, and Jake Agleron conspired to quash UE's persistence at making repeated comebacks the entire game, to topscore in their 65–61 win with 12, 12, and 10 points respectively.\nUST made a crucial turn when Ortiguerra blocked the Warriors' Ronald Tubid, with the ball landing on Baguio's hands. Tubid fouled Baguio and sent him to the line and was able to convert both shots. Agleron added two more free throws to give the Tigers a 64–58 lead. UE's Aldwyn Manubag fired a triple to cut down UST's lead to three with time running down. The Warriors fouled Baguio to stop the clock, and the Growling Tiger made one of two for the final count of 65–61.\nThe Growling Tigers fell victim to a 0–11 uprising by the Green Archers, midway in the first half to drop behind, 12–25. They ended the first period trailing by seven points at 32–39. They played catch-up the rest of the way as the team could not get the usual big plays from Ortiguerra, Baguio, and Alwyn Espiritu.\nNiño Gelig and Jake Agleron sparked an 8–1 run that brought the score to within three at 62–65 with 1:03 left in the game after being down, 54–64. Derick Hubalde then stole off La Salle's Mon Jose and streaked down for a fast break, but failed to pass off to an open Cyrus Baguio, and instead took a three-point shot and missed. The Archers were able to collar the rebound with 26 seconds remaining. La Salle's Renren Ritualo missed his shot, giving UST a chance to equalize, but Hubalde, who earlier converted three triples missed his potential game-tying attempt as the game clock expired.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nMarvin Ortiguerra was picked eighth in the first round of the 2001 PBA draft by the Norman Black-led Sta. Lucia Realtors team on January 14, 2001. Gilbert Lao, meanwhile applied for the draft the following year and was selected in the second round by the Chot Reyes-coached Coca-Cola Tigers as the 11th overall pick in the 2002 PBA draft on January 13, 2002."

        "text": "The 2023 Challenge Cup, known for sponsorship reasons as the 2023 Betfred Challenge Cup, was the 122nd edition of the Challenge Cup, the main rugby league knockout cup tournament in British rugby league run by the Rugby Football League (RFL). It began over the weekend of 11–12 February 2023 and ended with the final, at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 12 August.\nThe defending champions were Wigan Warriors, who won the 2022 Challenge Cup Final, by narrowly defeating Huddersfield Giants 16–14, but they were eliminated in the semi finals, as Brad Schneider kicked a drop goal in extra time, to win the game for Hull KR 11–10.\nBackground.\nThe competition started on 11 February and concluded with the final on 12 August. The final returned to its traditional home, Wembley Stadium in London, after being played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2022. League One team Cornwall R.L.F.C. made their first appearance in the competition having declined to enter in their debut season.\nAll professional RFL member clubs were invited to participate as well as a number of invited amateur teams including teams representing the British armed forces. This year the entry of the amateur clubs was split; in round 1, the armed forces teams entered along with the Scottish, Irish and Welsh champions with English teams from outside the National Conference League Premier Division making up the 36 teams to compete in the round. Ten teams from the National Conference League Premier Division joined in round 2, together with the 10 teams from League One. Shortly after the format for the tournament was announced, West Wales Raiders withdrew from the competition. The RFL announced that rounds one and two would be altered slightly to cope with this by increasing the number of teams in round one to 36 and reducing the numbers of new clubs in round two from 21 to 20.\nThe Championship clubs with the exception of Toulouse Olympique who declined to enter, joined the tournament in round 3. Rounds 4 and 5 reduced the lower league clubs to four before the Super League clubs entered in round 6.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first and second rounds were made at Wembley Stadium on 12 January 2023. Ties were played over the weekend of 11 and 12 February 2023.\nThird round.\nThe third round draw was made on 27 February.\nFourth round.\nThe draw for the fourth and fifth rounds was made on Wednesday 15 March at Millom RLFC, the oldest amateur club. No new teams enter in these rounds so the fourth round comprises just eight matches.\nFifth round.\nDrawn immediately after the fourth round draw, the four fixtures determined which teams from below Super League would progress to the draw with the 12 Super League teams.\nSixth round.\nThe draw for the sixth round took place live on BBC News' Sportsday on 24 April. The draw was made by England women's captain Jodie Cunningham.\nTies were played over the weekend of 19-21 May.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals was made live on BBC Two after the conclusion of the sixth-round tie between Castleford and Hull FC. The draw was made by John Kear. Ties were played over the weekend of 17–18 June.\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals was conducted on 18 June, during half time in the Wigan v Warrington match. The draw was made by Lois Forsell, head coach of Leeds Rhinos.\nTies took place over the weekend of 22–23 July, each being a double header with one of the semi-finals of the women's competition. \nFinal.\nOn 12 August 2022, the RFL announced that the Challenge Cup Final would return to Wembley after its one year hiatus, and be played as a triple header, alongside the women's final, and the 1895 Cup final. The final was played on 12 August 2023."

The tournament was played from April 6–9 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, United States.\nJon Rahm became the fourth Spaniard to win the Masters, shooting a three-under-par 69 in the final round for 276 (–12), four strokes ahead of runners-up Brooks Koepka and Phil Mickelson. Seeking his fifth major championship, Koepka led by two shots after the third round, but shot 75 to drop to second. Ten shots back, 52-year-old Mickelson recorded a 65 (–7) to jump into a tie for second, becoming the oldest player in Masters history to finish inside the top five.\nCourse.\nThe most notable change for 2023 came at the par-5 13th hole, where Augusta National purchased land from the adjacent Augusta Country Club that allowed it to push the tee boxes further back.

Séamus Power recorded an ace on consecutive holes to finish his round, becoming the fourth player in the event's history with two holes-in-one in the same year. Bubba Watson and defending champion Scottie Scheffler also made holes-in-one.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, April 6, 2023\"\nAt the conclusion to the first round, the lead was shared by three players, Viktor Hovland, Brooks Koepka, and Jon Rahm, who returned scores of 65 (7 under par). Rahm began his round with a double-bogey on the first hole after taking four putts; he was nine under par for the remainder of his round, including an eagle on the eighth hole. Hovland had no bogeys in his round; he made five birdies, and an eagle on the second hole. Koepka was five under par through 12 holes and, following a bogey on the thirteenth hole, birdied three of the last four holes to tie for the lead.\nCameron Young made a birdie on each of the first three holes and finished on 67 (5 under par), alongside Jason Day in a tie for fourth place. Reigning U.S. Amateur champion Sam Bennett started his round with a birdie on the first hole and an eagle on the second; he made another birdie on the sixth hole followed by twelve straight pars for a four under par round of 68. He was the first amateur to be placed in the top 10 after the first round since Ryan Moore in 2005. He was part of a seven-way tie for sixth place along with defending champion Scottie Scheffler, Sam Burns, Shane Lowry, Xander Schauffele, Adam Scott and Gary Woodland.\n63-year-old Fred Couples, the 1992 champion, scored 71 (1 under par), as did 2020 champion Dustin Johnson and three-time champion Phil Mickelson. Rory McIlroy made five birdies, three bogeys and a double-bogey to finish on 72 (even par). Tiger Woods bogeyed three of the first seven holes and was three over par before making birdies on the 15th and 16th holes; he made another bogey on the 18th to finish on 74, in a tie for 54th place.\nTwo players withdrew from the tournament. Kevin Na was unwell and stopped playing after nine holes, and Will Zalatoris withdrew prior to the start of his round with an injury.\nSource:\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, April 7, 2023\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, April 8, 2023\"\nOn Friday, tee times were moved forward 30 minutes to accommodate possible inclement weather. The second round of the tournament was suspended twice on Friday due to the threat of approaching thunderstorms; with play being suspended for the day following the second stoppage and resuming on Saturday. A few moments before the second suspension, three trees fell near the 17th tee.\nBrooks Koepka made three birdies and an eagle in a round of 67 (5 under par) to take a two-shot lead after 36 holes. Koepka's total of 132 (12 under par) was the third-best 36-hole score in Masters history, behind Jordan Spieth in 2015 and Raymond Floyd in 1976. Jon Rahm was two under par for his round, three behind Koepka, when play was suspended for the day on Friday; having resumed his round on Saturday morning, he made three birdies and two bogeys on the back nine to finish at 134 (10 under par), two off the lead and in second place. It was the first time in Masters history that two players finished the second round double-digits under par.\nSam Bennett had a second round of 68 to lie in third place, four behind Koepka. His two-round total of 136 (8 under par) was the best by an amateur through 36 holes since Ken Venturi in 1956, and he was the first amateur to finish the second round inside the top three on the leaderboard since Ricky Barnes in 2003. Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa were tied for fourth place on 138 (6 under par), with Sam Burns, Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Cameron Young a further stroke behind in a tie for sixth place.\nThe cut came at 147 (3 over par), with 54 players making it to the weekend. Tiger Woods finished at three over par after bogeys on his final two holes but made the cut for the record-tying 23rd consecutive Masters. Fred Couples, the 1992 champion, made the cut at +1, becoming the oldest player to make the cut at the Masters at the age of 63 years, six months. He surpassed Bernhard Langer, who had set the record in 2020 at 63 years, two months. Notable players to miss the cut included reigning PGA Champion Justin Thomas, 2020 U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, and four-time major champion and world number two Rory McIlroy. Larry Mize and Sandy Lyle, champions in 1987 and 1988, both missed the cut in their final Masters appearances.\nThere was one withdrawal during the second round: Louis Oosthuizen, who withdrew prior to the resumption of play on Saturday, having completed 17 holes on Friday before play was suspended.\nSource:\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, April 8, 2023\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Sunday, April 9, 2023\"\nWith persistent rain causing several greens to become unplayable due to flooding, play was suspended for the day at 3:16 pm Eastern time on Saturday. At the time, Brooks Koepka was leading by 4 strokes over playing partner Jon Rahm, with both men on the seventh green.\nWhen play resumed on Sunday, Koepka's lead was quickly halved as he made a bogey and a birdie on the seventh and eighth holes, while Rahm made two birdies. The lead was reduced to one stroke on the 12th hole when Koepka made a bogey. Further bogeys by Rahm at the 13th and 16th holes, and by Koepka on the 17th meant both players were round in 73 strokes (1 over par) and Koepka took a two-stroke lead into the final round later in the day.\nViktor Hovland was three over par on his round through ten holes but made five consecutive birdies on holes 11 through 15 to finish at 70 (2 under par) and move up to third place, one stroke behind Rahm. Patrick Cantlay made three straight birdies on the front nine and three more on the back in a round of 68 (4 under par) to move into fourth place. Hideki Matsuyama, the 2021 champion, began his round with a bogey and double-bogey but was five under par for holes 8 through 15, which lifted him into a tie for fifth place with Russell Henley. Sam Bennett made only one birdie in his round of 76 (4 over par) to fall to seventh place alongside Collin Morikawa; he became the first amateur to enter the final round of the Masters inside the top-10 since Deane Beman in 1964.\nTiger Woods withdrew due to injury prior to the resumption of play on Sunday.\nSource:\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 9, 2023\"\nSummary.\nJon Rahm came from two shots behind at the start of the final round to become the fourth Spaniard to win the Masters title.\nRahm birdied the third hole and tied Brooks Koepka for the lead when Koepka missed a par putt on the fourth. Koepka also bogeyed the sixth hole and Rahm took a two-shot lead when he chipped to four feet on the par-5 eighth hole and made the putt for birdie, while Koepka missed a long birdie putt after being forced to chip out from the trees off his drive. Both players bogeyed the ninth hole, Rahm when his approach shot spun off the front of the green into the fairway. Koepka added another bogey on the par-3 12th when his tee shot went over the green and he left his chip shot short. Now leading Koepka by three shots, Rahm chipped to within five feet on the par-5 13th and made birdie, while Koepka also birdied the hole after getting up and down from off the green, his first birdie in 23 holes.\nRahm hit his approach into the 14th hole to four feet and made the putt to get to 12-under for the tournament. He parred his last four holes, including an up-and-down from short of the green on the 18th, to win his second major championship and first career Masters with a three-under 69. Koepka, meanwhile, three-putted for bogey on 14 to fall to third place but made consecutive birdies on holes 15–16 to get back to nine-under. Another bogey on the 17th left him at eight-under for the tournament with a three-over 75 in the final round.\nThree-time champion Phil Mickelson began the final round 10 shots off the lead before going two-under on his front nine. He holed a 23-foot putt for birdie on the 12th and two-putted for birdie on both the 13th and 15th. At the 17th, his approach shot settled within a foot of the hole for another birdie. He then closed his round with an 11-foot putt for birdie on the 18th, finishing with a seven-under 65 to tie Koepka for second place. The round tied Mickelson's best career score at the Masters and was the lowest by a player over the age of 50. He also became the oldest player to finish in the top-five at the Masters, surpassing the record of Jimmy Demaret in 1962.\nJordan Spieth, the 2015 champion, was playing with Mickelson and made six birdies from holes 8 to 17 as he went seven-under on his round before a bogey at the last. He finished with a 66 (−6) and tied for fourth place, his nine birdies tying the Masters record for most in a final round. Another past champion, Patrick Reed, double-bogeyed the second hole but made six birdies over his next 11 holes. He also birdied the 18th hole to shoot 68 (−4) and tie Spieth for fourth, along with Russell Henley.\nViktor Hovland, who began the round three shots off the lead, did not make a birdie until the 13th and double-bogeyed the sixth as he fell back with a two-over 74, finishing tied for seventh place. Cameron Young eagled the 13th and birdied 17 to get to seven-under, but dropped back to six-under with a closing bogey to tie Hovland. Sahith Theegala, playing in his first Masters, chipped in for birdie on the 16th as he shot 67 (−5) to climb into the top 10 and finish alone in ninth place. Defending champion Scottie Scheffler was four-under on his round and within four shots of the lead before hitting his tee shot on the 12th into the bushes over the green, leading to a double-bogey after taking a drop; he finished at four-under, tied for 10th place. Sam Bennett began the round in seventh place but made only one birdie as he shot 74 (+2). His 16th-place finish was the best by an amateur since Ryan Moore was 13th in 2005.\nFinal leaderboard.\nSource:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nSource:"

        "text": "The men's overall competition in the 2016 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved 44 events in 5 disciplines: downhill (DH) (11 races), Super-G (SG) (8 races), giant slalom (GS) (11 races), slalom (SL) (11 races), and Alpine combined (AC) (3 races). The newly introduced \"Parallel giant slalom\" event at Alta Badia, Italy—which was included in the giant slalom season standings—was a relatively short Giant slalom course that pitted the men against one another in a modified bracket-reduction format from a field of thirty-two qualifying skiers, eventually whittled down to just four final-round racers in a \"large final\" (for the championship) and a \"small final\" (for third).\n27-year-old Marcel Hirscher of Austria won the overall title for the fifth consecutive time, tying two all-time records: most overall World Cup titles by a man (five, tied with Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, and one less than the overall record of six held since 1979 by Annemarie Moser-Pröll), and most consecutive titles (five, also held by Moser-Pröll).\nAn odd incident threatened to mar the early season as a small, remotely-piloted camera drone, operated by broadcast media to give viewers a taste of the skiers' field of vision, crashed and narrowly missed Hirscher during his second run in the slalom at Madonna di Campiglio just before Christmas. Hirscher nevertheless finished second in the race, but shortly after the incident, the International Ski Federation banned remotely-piloted vehicles from flying over their events as a matter of safety and concern for the welfare of their athletes, staff and viewers.\nThrough midseason, possession of the overall crystal globe for the season was closely fought between four-time overall champion Hirscher and two-time overall champion Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, with Svindal actually in the lead, but on 23 January, in the legendary \"Streif\" downhill on the Hahnenkamm at Kitzbühel, Austria, Svindal fell and suffered a season-ending ligament tear in his right knee. Because of poor visibility and dangerous winds, which already had led the course to be shortened, the downhill produced three serious crashes in just 30 skiers, the minimum number for the race to be deemed official, before it was stopped—but the damage had already been done.\nAfter Svindal's departure, Hirscher won the overall crystal globe by almost 500 points over Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway. In addition to Svindal and Kristofferson, two other Norwegians placed in the top 7 in overall points: Kjetil Jansrud and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde.\nThe finals were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland from 16 to 20 March 2016."

The university sponsored varsity ice hockey from 1939 to 1949.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s students at Georgetown attempted to form an ice hockey team by flooding the tennis courts. Unfortunately, weather conditions were far too warm for the endeavor to succeed and any such plans were shelved until a more suitable arrangement could be made. The school had to wait until 1938 when the Riverside Stadium opened and an informal team was formed. The club's success in its first year led the school to eventually recognize the team for the 1939–40-year and Georgetown played its first official game on February 12, 1940.\nIn 1941 the larger Uline Arena opened and the team moved to a new home. With the change of venue, the team responded by going undefeated and raising the profile of the program. The prospects for the team's 4th season were high, however, there was a major hang-up. Due to the effects of the United States entry into World War II, The Hoyas had trouble getting access to the Uline Arena and ended up having to cancel their entire 1943 season. The team remained mothballed until the 1946–47 but, once they got back on the ice, they seemed to pick up right where they left off.\nWhile there was renewed hope for the team, the viability of the program was harmed by forces beyond their control. Despite a small number of nearby opponents, the team was able to continue until 1949. Unfortunately, that year the Washington Lions folded. As a result, Uline Arena curtailed its ice availability and was only open for public skating on Sunday. Without a rick to use, the school had little choice but to suspend operations.\nGeorgetown did eventually return to the ice once other rinks were opened in the area. However, the school has never seen fit to return the team to varsity status (as of 2023)."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a first baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs.\nMost of the career leaders are relatively recent players who have benefitted from improved infield defense, with equipment of better quality; 10 of the top 13 players made their major league debut after 1970. Longer careers have compensated for the fact that as strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined, with double play totals for first basemen likewise declining; 16 of the top 20 single-season totals were recorded between 1944 and 1980. Because a right-handed first baseman needs to turn their body before throwing across the infield, left-handed first basemen are often preferred for defensive purposes; 14 of the top 21 career double-play leaders are left-handed. Mickey Vernon holds the record for the most career double plays by a first baseman with 2,044. Eddie Murray (2,033) and Todd Helton (2,028) are the only other first basemen who have recorded 2,000 career double plays."

He currently plays for the Somerset Patriots, the Double-A affiliate of the team. He played College Baseball at Northeastern University in Boston, MA and played High School Baseball at St. Johns Preparatory School in Danvers, MA.\nBurt stands at 6'1\" and weighs around 200lbs. He bats and throws with his right hand.\nAmateur career.\nSt. Johns Preparatory School (High School) 2011–14.\nBurt played High School Baseball at St. Johns Preparatory School in Danvers, MA, where he was the captain of the baseball team as well as playing basketball all 4 years at St. Johns and golf for 2 years. He had a .330 career batting average at St. Johns while leading them to win the league championship in 2013 and 2014 as well as earning multiple awards at St. Johns.\nNortheastern University (College) 2015–18.\nHe then played college ball for the Northeastern Huskies from 2015 to 2018, batting .260/.333/.367 with 214 hits, 12 home runs, 109 RBI and 33 stolen bases in 224 games.\nProfessional career.\nYankees organization 2018–present.\nBurt was drafted by the New York Yankees in the 28th round of the 2018 MLB Draft, 847th overall.\n2018- Pulaski Yankees (Rk.).\nBurt spent the entire 2018 season with the Yankees Rookie Ball team the Pulaski Yankees, where Burt slashed .274/.347/.366 with 51 hits and no home runs in 51 games.\n2019- 3 teams: Charleston RiverDogs (A), Tampa Tarpons (A+), Trenton Thunder (AA).\nBurt played in three different levels of the minor leagues in 2019 going from Single-A Charleston RiverDogs to the High-A Tampa Tarpons to the Double-A Trenton Thunder. He hit .222/.272/.313 with 80 hits and 8 home runs in 106 games across all three levels that season.\n2021- 3 teams: Tampa Tarpons (A), Somerset Patriots (AA), Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (AAA).\nBurt again played in three different levels in 2021 (No 2020 MiLB season due to the pandemic), this time starting the season in Double-A with the Somerset Patriots before being sent down to Single-A Tampa, and back up to Somerset. This eventually led up to his first career call up to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders. He slashed .237/.303/.373 with 70 hits and 7 home runs in 91 games across all three levels in 2021.\n2022- Somerset Patriots (AA).\nBurt spent the entire 2022 season with Double-A Somerset, hitting .205/.269/.373 with 55 hits and 11 home runs in 85 games.\n2023- 2 Teams: Somerset Patriots (AA), Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders (AAA).\nHe began the 2023 season in the same place he spent all of the 2022 season, with the Double-A Somerset Patriots. Burt started off his 2023 campaign strong, going 11-for-21 (.524 Batting Average) with 3 Home Runs, and an Eastern League Leading 12 RBI and 1.625 OPS in the first seven games of the season. Burt credited an adjusted mentality while batting as a key component to his early success, saying \"It's all mental for me. I knew I had all the physical attributes and stuff like that, but for me I needed to take a step up mentally and I knew that was my next step to kind of take me to that next level. I'm still working on it every day. You're only as good as your next at-bat.\" Burt attributed this change in mindset to Somerset's hitting coach, Jake Hirst, saying he helped him \"dumb everything down\" while in the batter's box, so he's not flooded with thoughts as the pitch is coming in. He reflected on his struggles at the plate in 2022, saying \"Last year [2022] was too much life and death with every at-bat, where this year, I'm thinking more about the whole process. This season, every pitch is its own pitch, every pitch is its own entity. The at-bat I have in April is hopefully going to be the at-bat I have in October, so I'm viewing every pitch the exact same this year.\" His good play earned him a promotion to the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on June 22, 2023. It was his second trip to Triple-A in his career, and the first since his 36 game stint in 2021 where he slashed an underwhelming .187/.261/.290 (.550 OPS) and struck out 33 times compared to only 11 walks, 1 home run, and 20 hits. His time in Triple-A this time around was even shorter than the last, playing in only seven games, where he went 2-for-16 with no home runs, and slashed .125/.300/.125 before being sent back down to the Patriots. He finished the season with Somerset, hitting a career-high 12 home runs in 2023, and finished with an overall slash line of .235/.319/.393 across 98 games with Somerset and Scranton."

        "text": "The 1947–48 Brown Bears men's ice hockey season was the 23rd season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Bears represented Brown University and were coached by Westcott Moulton, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter a 9-year absence, Brown returned to the ice with Westcott Moulton (class of 1931) now helming the program. The Bears were predictably having to contend with a lack of experienced players but, with the Rhode Island Auditorium still at their disposal, Brown could still get practice time regardless of the weather conditions. The first game for the Bruins came against Harvard who, though no longer the preeminent power, were still a tough team to beat. The Bears showed up well and kept the contest close, ending regulation with a 5–5 tie. The 10-minute overtime, however, demonstrated just how far the Brunos still had to go. Harvard was able to score 5 additional goals in the extra session which were mostly attributed to Brown's lack of depth. The team performed nearly as well in their second game when they rallied from a 2–5 deficit in the third to end just 1 goal shy of a tie. The same trend continued in Brown's third game when the Bears kept the game close only to see Princeton pull away late.\nBrown didn't play against until after returning from the winter break. In the interim, Moulton was able to put together a third line with new addition Rod Scheffer teaming with Henry Healy and Charlie Bryant while Warren Howard took over as the starter in goal. Unfortunately, they were met at home by one of the top teams in the nation. Boston University had little sympathy for the returning Bears and throttled Brown 2–13. Near the end of the game the Bruins, unable to match the offensive punch of the Terriers, fought back in the only way they could when Ned Dewey got into a fight with Don Cleary. While it had no impact on the outcome of the game, the scuffle buoyed the team for their match with Colby. The inspired Bears tore through the Mules and posted their first win on the season in dominating fashion.\nThere was renewed hope after the victory and Brown was looking for revenge against Harvard. Unfortunately, just like the BU game, very little went right for the Bears. The Crimson squad eviscerated Brown to the tune of 3–17, posting the most goals scored against the Brunos in program history (still a record as of 2022). The only consolation in the game was that star center Fred Nelson was able to keep his scoring streak alive.\nUnbowed by the severe defeat, Brown played well in the next game against Fort Devens State. While the score was close, it was only through the efforts of Chiefs' netminder Hal Downes. Brown was obviously the better team throughout the game and were able to post their second win of the season. After an unfortunate but predictable loss to the best team in the country, Dartmouth, Brown headed to West Point for their final game before the semester break. Leading up to the game the Bears were unable to practice due to the Ice Capades being at the Auditorium. That and the fact that it was the third road game that week made the Bears sluggish and unable to counter a fairly strong Cadet team. Brown entered the examination period with a disappointing 2–6 mark but had played far better than their record indicated.\nThe Bruins went down the home stretch of their season with three games in four days after the break. Joining the team were newcomers George Menard, Dan Rawson and Jim Ferry. After a strong win over MIT, the Bruins stunned Yale with an 8–7 win. The winning streak was ended by Cal goaltender Ian Watson who stymied the Bears for much of the match. Menard proved himself to be a great addition to the team when he played the entire game against New Hampshire and scored the Bears' final two goals in the match. The Bears ended the season with a narrow defeat to MIT, however, despite the poor record the year was seen as a success; Brown had won several games and even in some of their losses they did not look out of place with some of the college hockey regulars.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "The 1947–48 California Golden Bears men's ice hockey season was the 18th season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Bears represented the University of California, Berkeley and were coached by Julius Schroder.\nSeason.\nAfter a rather poor season, Cal got under way early with a game before Thanksgiving. While they lost the match, it did reveal the two best players on the team, Pat Finnegan and Ian Watson. Cal played sparingly over the succeeding month but were able to get in enough practice time to improve their play and earn their first victory in the rematch with the Olympic Club. A couple of weeks afterwards, the Bears stunned British Columbia to the tune of 6–2 with Finnegan's hat-trick leading the way.\nWith renewed optimism, the team welcomed a pair of midwestern colleges to the Pacific for a three-game slate over the winter break. Cal kept close in all of the games but lost each match despite their best efforts. Though the losses stung, the team could hang their hat on drawing 5,500 spectators to the game in Los Angeles. That plus the potential of UCLA returning to the ice gave hope that the Golden Bears program would be able to continue. While the future appeared rosy, the present was a bit murky. Cal's losing streak was extended with another loss to the Olympic Club. Just before the exam break, Cal lost another pair of games to the Olympics, dropping their record to 2–7.\nDuring the break, the team went on a 6,000 mile journey to play several other college teams. Their first stop was in Colorado where they took on one of the strongest outfits that season, the Colorado College Tigers. Once more, Cal was able to keep the score close in the two-game series but ended up dropping both contests. A few days later the team was in New England and were finally able to end their losing streak with a win over Yale. Unfortunately, Ian Watson was injured in the game when a puck struck him in the face. He finished the match but was out for the following night's tilt against Dartmouth. His absence couldn't have come at a worse time as the Indians were the best team in the nation and throttled the Golden Bears 4–13 while the green's backup netminder manned the goal crease for Cal.\nWatson was healthy enough to return for the game at Brown and Cal proved to be the superior species of Bruin as the Golden Bears swamped the Brunos 10–4. Cal then travelled to face Michigan on their return trip but they were woefully outmatched by the superb Wolverine squad. The Maize and Blue trounced Cal 2–11 in the first meeting while Watson's stellar play allowed the team to at least save face in the rematch. While the trip didn't turn out as they might have hoped, the five losses they suffered were all against teams that would make the NCAA tournament. Cal ended its season with a final game against the Olympic Club and produced their best effort to date. Their performance in the 15–6 win was perhaps too little too late but Cal had performed well in many of their games despite possessing far fewer players than their collegiate opponents.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

Cal, along with most other schools, shuttered its program for the duration of World War II but was the only Pacific coast team to return after the war. The Golden Bears attempted to continue their program but, without a nearby rival to keep the interest up, Cal was forced to shutter the program in 1949.\nThe team was partially revived as a club sport later and continues to operate on an informal basis as of 2023."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Peacocks represent Saint Peter's University in the NCAA's Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.\nSaint Peter's began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1930. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Saint Peter's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "The Miami Indians were a minor league baseball team based in Miami, Oklahoma. In 1921, the Indians played the season as charter members of the Class D level Southwestern League, finishing in seventh place. Miami hosted home minor league games at Miami Field, that lied within Riverview Park, which is still in use today. The Indians were succeeded in minor league play by the 1946 Miami Blues of the Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri League.\nHistory.\nBeginning minor league play in 1921, the Miami \"Indians\" became a charter member of the eight team, Class D level Southwestern League. The Bartlesville Braves, Coffeyville Refiners, Independence Producers, Muskogee Mets, Parsons Parsons, Pittsburg Pirates and Sapulpa Sappers teams joined Miami in beginning league play on April 21, 1921.\nThe \"Indians\" nickname corresponds with local and regional history. The city of Miami was founded in 1891 and is named for the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, with the city still serving today as the capital of the federally recognized Miami Tribe of Oklahoma.\nThe president of the Miami Indians franchise was former major league player Benny Meyer. Meyer gained control of the team in March 1921 with no players on the roster. He put ads for players in \"The Sporting News\" and held a tryout at Robison Field in St. Louis, Missouri, where over 30 players showed up. Meyer left the team during the season to become a minor league scout.\nAt the Indians' opening day at Miami Field on April 27, 1921, there were 2,500 in attendance at the 2,000-seat ballpark. The game against Muskogee was preceded by a luncheon for the team and a parade leading to the ballpark.\nIn their first season of play in the league, the Miami Indians placed seventh. With a record of 59–84, playing the season under the direction of manager Bobby Byrne, Miami finished 43.5 games behind the first place Independence Producers (103–38), who finished 19.0 games ahead of the second place Muskogee Mets. The 1921 final standings featured the Independence Producers, followed by the Muskogee Mets (93–56), Pittsburg Pirates (87–63), Coffeyville Refiners (71–72), Sapulpa Sappers (68–76), Bartlesville Braves (64–80), Miami Indians (59–84) and Parsons Parsons / Cushing Oilers (34–110).\nMiami players Ray Flaskamper and Bill Walker advanced to play major league baseball. Invited by Benny Meyer, Walker was discovered by scouts at a tryout at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis in 1921. After the tryout, Walker was put under contract and assigned to play for Miami at age 17. Walker later won the National League ERA title in 1929 and 1931, making the 1935 All-Star team. Miami Player/manager Bobby Byrne had previously played eleven seasons in the major leagues.\nIn 1922, the Southwestern League became a Class C level League, however the Miami franchise did not return to league play. Miami next hosted minor league baseball with the 1946 Miami Blues, an affiliate of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began a seven-year stretch as members of the Class D level Kansas-Oklahoma-Missouri League.\nThe ballpark.\nThe Miami Indians played 1921 home minor league games at Miami Park. Later called \"League Park\" during the 1921 season, the ballpark was within the public park, known as Riverview Park. Riverview Park was opened in 1917 and the park has been prone to flooding in its location on the Neosho River. 1921 ticket prices were .25 cents for children, .50 cents for general admission, .75 cents for a grandstand seat and $1.00 for a box seat. Still in use as a public park today, Riverview Park is located at 700-798 South Main Street in Miami."

        "title": "Premier Rugby Sevens",
        "text": "Premier Rugby Sevens (PR7s) is the top annual North American men's and women's rugby sevens competition. The competition follows a touring model and involves 16 teams (8 men's and 8 women's teams) competing against each other across the country. The league was founded in 2021 and is officially sanctioned by USA Rugby as the highest level of rugby sevens in the United States.\nThe League is the first professional rugby union competition in North America to offer contracts to women.\nHistory.\nPremier Rugby Sevens was launched in 2021 by CEO and Founder Owen Scannell. Former USA Men's XV head coach Mike Tolkin joined the league in 2021 as general manager. In May 2021, the league announced 10 ambassadors from the USA Men's and Women's Rugby Sevens teams would join, including Perry Baker, Naya Tapper, Alev Kelter, Danny Barrett, Folau Niua, Stephen Tomasin, Kevon Williams, Abby Gustaitis, Ilona Maher and Carlin Isles. Neither Maher nor Isles would compete in 2021. In August 2021, USA Rugby announced that the league would be officially sanctioned as the highest level of rugby sevens in the United States.\n2021.\nThe league's Inaugural Championship took place at AutoZone Park in Memphis, Tennessee, on October 9, 2021. The League initially began with 10 teams with 6 men's and 4 women's teams. The Experts, Loggerheads, Loonies and Headliners would have a men's team and women's team competing in the two separate tournaments while the Locals and Team would play with only a men's team entered into the competition.\nThe women's Loonies coached by Olympian Kelly Griffin won the women's tournament, with standout play from Alev Kelter and tournament MVP and Canadian international Delaney Aikens. The men's Experts won the Inaugural Championships behind performances from Perry Baker and tournament MVP Logan Tago. Tago would go on to receive his first USA cap shortly after. The men's final was notably in that it was decided by a drop goal contest with a similar format to association football.\n2022.\nThe competition scaled to a three stop circuit in 2022, with tournaments held in San Jose, California, at PayPal Park, Washington, D.C., at Audi Field, and the 2022 Championship at Q2 Stadium. The League scaled back to include only the men's and women's teams, with the Team and Locals removed from competition. The parity between men's and women's teams led to the adoption of nomenclature of \"franchises\" with each franchise having a men's and women's team. The franchises would then compete for a United Championship which combined the results of the two competitions.\nThe Headliners were the first United Champions and won the Kathy Flores Women's Championship while the Loggerheads won the A. Jon Prusmack Men's Championship. Notable players appearing in 2022 included All Black Sevens star Brady Rush, USA Rugby Stars Alena Olsen, Martin Iosefo, Matai Leuta and Madison Hughes.\nExpansion.\n2023.\nThe League announced in December 2022 that in 2023 it would expand into a conference structure and play a five-tournament circuit. Franchises would be split between the Eastern and Western Conferences, with tournaments alternating play each week between the two conferences. Each conference plays two weekends, with the top two men's and women's teams from each conference qualifying for the Championship weekend. Additionally, the 2023 expansion added regional names to the teams for the first time in league history. The rebranded Texas Team and New York Locals would rejoin the men's competition, and add women's teams for the first time. Additionally, the league announced that the Golden State Retrievers and the Pittsburgh Steeltoes would join the league as expansion franchises.\nOn May 2, New Zealand Black Ferns star Ruby Tui announced that she had signed for the 2023 competition alongside her return to the Black Ferns Sevens team. The All Blacks subsequently announced that other New Zealand stars Stacey Waaka, Kelsey Teneti, Tysha Ikenasio, Manaia Nuku, Rhodes Featherstone and Kitiona Vai would also be competing. Teneti would ultimately not compete due to injury and would be replaced by Alena Saili.\nFor the Eastern Conference, the Kickoff Weekend took place at Q2 Stadium in Austin, Texas with the Conference Final held at Highmark Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Western Conference opened at TCO Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while the Conference Final took place at PayPal Park in San Jose. The Championship was held at Audi Field in Washington, D.C. The Pittsburgh and Minneapolis events were the first ever professional rugby events in those cities.\nThe Northern Loonies would win the women's championship while the Rhinos x SoCal Loggerheads would win the men's. The Rocky Mountain Experts would win the United Championship by virtue of being the only franchise to have both the men's and women's teams qualify for the Championship tournament.\nCompetitive Format.\nThe league has played single day tournaments since inception, with men's and women's matches interchanging throughout the day. In the 2021 and 2022 seasons, all teams in the league would be onsite and play group stage matches with results determining participants in the final. The 2022 season had the first two tournaments determine the seeding for the knockout round championship.\nIn 2023, franchises were split between the Eastern and Western Conferences, with tournaments alternating play each week between the two conferences. Each conference plays two weekends, with the top two men's and women's teams from each conference qualifying for the Championship weekend. The league eliminated group stage play and instead moved to a knockout only format with semifinal matches leading into consolation and finals. Points are allocated based on finish, with the two conference kickoff weekends would award 13, 6, 3, 1 points for 1st through 4th place, respectively while the conference finals would award 19, 11, 5, 2. Teams would also be awarded points for finish in the Championship weekend for purposes of determining the United Championship winner.\nBroadcast.\nUnited States and Canada.\nThe 2021 championship matches of the tournaments were aired live on FS2 in the United States, and TSN in Canada. Preliminary matches were aired on FoxSports.com and TSN.ca.\nAll matches from the 2022 Championship were aired live on Fubo Sports Network.\nIn 2023, Fox Sports and CBS Sports televised portions the 2023 Championship season, with live programming on FS1, CBS Sports Network and Tubi. The championship finals were aired live on FS1.\nEurope.\nDAZN would acquire the broadcast rights for Europe in 2023.\nSponsors.\nSamurai Sportswear has been the official kit and ball supplier since the league began in 2021. Samurai has provided the match kits for all teams and referees.\nThe league has had a data partnership with Sports Info Solutions (SIS) since 2022.\nThe Loggerheads franchise has been licensed by Rhinos Rugby Academy since 2022. In 2023, the Loggerheads were referred to as the Rhinos x Loggerheads as a part of the licensing agreement.\nOn the league announced GoodSport as the official hydration partner.\nLeague champions.\nIn 2022, the league named its women's and men's championship trophies after Kathy Flores and A. Jon Prusmack, respectively."

In 1874 the British Major Walter Clopton Wingfield he patent the House of London Crafts the invention of a new game, which consists of a shaped field hourglass, divided in the middle by a net suspended. The game was packaged in a box containing some balls, four paddles, the network and the signs to mark the field. The game was based on the rules of the old real tennis and, at the suggestion of Arthur Balfour, was called lawn-tennis. The official date of birth of the court would be February 23, 1874.\nThis year the world's first two official tennis tournaments for men are held, one the All Ireland Lawn Tennis Championships organised by the All Ireland Lawn Tennis Club and held at the Champion Ground, Lansdowne, Dublin. The other the South of Ireland Championships in Limerick, County Limerick. The following year the tournament would staged the first Open championships in Ireland took place in August 1877, the same year as the first All-England championships of Wimbledon. The event was not held in Dublin but at the Limerick Lawn Tennis Club, putting Limerick in a premier position on the tennis map predating Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club by two years.\nCalendar.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match.

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Aggies represent Texas A&amp;M University in the NCAA's Southeastern Conference.\nTexas A&amp;M began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1912. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Texas A&amp;M's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "title": "2023 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Men's overall",
        "text": "The men's overall in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of 38 events in four disciplines: downhill (DH) (10 races), super-G (SG) (8 races), giant slalom (GS) (10 races), and slalom (SL) (10 races). The fifth and sixth disciplines in FIS ski events, parallel (PAR). and Alpine combined (AC), had all events in the 2022–23 season cancelled, either due to the schedule disruption cased by the COVID-19 pandemic (AC) or due to bad weather (PAR). The original calendar contained 43 events, but in addition to the parallel, four downhills were cancelled over the course of the season.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, from 6–19 February 2023. During the world championships, Norwegian star Atle Lie McGrath, who then was in 11th place overall, fell during the super-G and suffered a ACL tear, which required season-ending surgery.\nSeason summary.\nFrom the very first race of the season, defending champion Marco Odermatt of Switzerland seized the lead in the standings due to his abilities in all disciplines except for slalom. After the first fifteen races, he had built a lead of over 300 points over speed specialist Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway. However, after Odermatt was injured during a downhill at Kitzbühel on 20 January and had to miss the following few races, Kilde was able to draw within 200 points by 25 January. However, Odermatt won the next two races to push his lead back over 300 points. \nWhen Kilde did not enter the two giant slaloms in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia on 11-12 March, Odermatt clinched the season championship due to holding a lead of over 400 points, while the maximum points potentially available to Kilde were only 400. But after winning both races, Odermatt entered the World Cup finals needing just 174 points from his three specialties to surpass Hermann Maier's men's all-time points record of 2,000 in one season, set in the 2000 season and only surpassed so far by two women: Tina Maze in 2013 and Mikaela Shiffrin in 2019 and this year. In his first two races during the finals, Odermatt finished 15th in downhill (16 points) and won the super-G (100 points), leaving him just 58 points short of Maier's record; a finish of third or better in the giant slalom would give Odermatt the record. He then won the giant slalom (by 2.11 seconds!) to set a new Men's World Cup points record of 2,042 points.\nThe victory also enabled Odermatt to tie the men's record of 13 victories in a season on the World Cup circuit, a record Odermatt now shares with Maier (2001), Ingemar Stenmark (1979), and Marcel Hirscher (2018) -- and behind only two women: Shiffrin (17 wins in 2019; 14 wins this year) and Vreni Schneider (14 wins in 1989).\nFinals.\nThe last events of the season took place at the World Cup finals, Wednesday, 15 March 2023 through Sunday, 19 March 2023 in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline were eligible to compete in the finals, with the exception that any skier who has scored at least 500 points in the overall classification was eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of his standing in that discipline for the season."

The Golden Knights represented the Clarkson College of Technology and were coached by Jack Roos, in his 17th season.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, coach Roos had few returning players and had to rely on an influx of freshmen to help fill out the team. The result was that the team wasn't quite as cohesive as the squads that Roos had put together in the past but the Golden Knights still showed that they could compete at the same level as other top programs. After sweeping a series against Carleton, Tech jumped right into the fire with a game versus Dartmouth at Watertown, New York. The knights did well to limit one of the top offensive teams to just two goals but they were only able to get a single marker themselves. Clarkson then began a road trip with an overpowering performance against Champlain but couldn't quite pull out a victory over either Princeton or Yale.\nOnce they returned home, Clarkson appeared to be a bit tired from their junket and were soundly beaten by Colgate. After the worst performance of the season, Tech rallied to defeat nearby rival St. Lawrence before romping to two shutout wins over rather weak opponents. The rematch with Dartmouth ended with the same result as the first game, leaving little doubt that the Indians were the better team. Afterwards, Tech was able to defeat two more Canadian schools, but ended the year losing to a much improved Army squad.\nThe revamped lineup had shown some progress throughout the year but there was still room for improvement from the Knights. Unfortunately, coach Roos would not be around to lead the team; he retired from his position following the season after 19 years with the school.\nCharles Hyde and Martin Gabey served as team managers.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

After winning the next-to-last race of the season in Jasná, Brem opened a 52-point lead over Rebensburg, meaning that as long as she finished no worse than fourth in the finals in St. Moritz, Brem would win the championship no matter what Rebensburg did. And that was exactly what happened, as Rebensburg stormed through the last run of the giant slalom at finals for a commanding victory, but Brem, running last, barely managed to hold onto fourth by 0.03 seconds to win the season championship by two points (592 to 590)."

He was also a national representative in the sports of squash and table tennis.\nThe son of an all-round sportsman, Kemp had his best period on the tennis tour in the late 1940s, debuting for the Ireland Davis Cup team in 1946. He made 9 Davis Cup appearances for Ireland from 1946 to 1952. He was singles runner-up at the Irish championships in 1946 and 1947, and won the event in 1950. His run at the 1947 Irish championships included an upset semi-final win over Tom Brown, who was fresh off making a Wimbledon final. In 1948 he won through to the third round at Wimbledon, before losing to the top seeded Frank Parker.\nAlice Marble (USA), the greatest woman player of her day, came to Dublin in 1939 to compete in the Irish Championships at Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club and during her stay played an exhibition match against Kemp. Marble, who in the week before her appearance in Dublin had become the first woman of the century to win the Triple Crown at Wimbledon — the Mixed Doubles, the Ladies’ Doubles, and the Ladies’ Singles titles — won the hard-fought match 9-7, 8-6. A full account of the match can be found in the Irish Times edition of 14th July 1939. "

        "text": "Douglas Hugh Reid, OAM was an Australian professional tennis player, influential figure in the Australian horse racing industry, and esteemed member of the Victoria Racing Club (VRC). Reid's contributions to both tennis and horse racing left a lasting impact on the sporting landscape of Australia.\nBorn 12 July 1934 in Moreland a suburb of Melbourne Victoria, Reid played tennis at Wimbledon in 1954, making the quarter final at Queen’s where he lost to fellow Australian Ken Rosewall that same year. Later Doug Reid along with his brothers Wayne Reid and Jim Reid, John Brown and Frank Sedgman would start professional promotions company Tennis Camps of Australia (TCA) \n which would go on to establish and run the professional era of the Australian Open Tennis tournament at Kooyong. TCA’s innovation in promotion of the Open would ensure the Tournament’s future success, for example in 1974 cigarette company Marlboro became a naming rights sponsor – a move that was described at the time as “groundbreaking”. \nDoug Reid would also have a successful career in the horse racing industry, breeding and racing Champion mare Maybe Mahal who was named the 1977/78 Australian Racehorse of the Year. Trained by Bart Cummings, Maybe Mahal was a dominant sprinter/miler in the late 1970s, winning both handicaps and weight-for-age contests with notable victories that included two Lightning Stakes, a Newmarket Handicap, Craven A Stakes, George Adams Mile, Doomben 10,000 and Doncaster Handicap. Reid also served on the VRC Committee for almost 30 years and in 1996 was awarded an OAM for his services to the racing industry. \nReid served the VRC in many capacities during his 28 years on the Committee including the following positions:\n- Committee Member of the Australian Stud Book\n- Chairman of VRC Program Sub-Committee\n- Chairman of VOBIS\n- Member of Racing Appeals Board\n- Chairman Racing Products Pty Ltd. In the racing industry, Reid championed strategic moves that enabled Victorian horse racing to prosper driving boosts to prize money, corporate sponsorship and hospitality packages, slick promotion and significant TV deals. Reid was chief negotiator when the Melbourne Cup become a million-dollar race with sponsorship by Foster's in 1985. With Reid having earlier convinced his fellow VRC Committee members that a live broadcast of the Melbourne Cup carnival in 1978 with ATV-0 would not damage but rather bolster on course attendance.\nReid, most active in competitive tennis during the 1950s, competed at all grand slam tournaments during his career. His only overseas tour was in 1954 and included a first round loss to Ham Richardson at the U.S. national championships. He was later a Victoria Racing Club committee member and bred and raced racehorse Maybe Mahal, Australian Horse of the Year in 1978. His brothers Jim and Wayne were both noted sports administrators.\nOn 30 May 2014, Douglas Hugh Reid passed away, leaving behind a legacy that continues to be celebrated in the realms of tennis and horse racing. His expertise, dedication, and profound contributions to the Victoria Racing Club and the Australian sporting community remain deeply respected and cherished. The loss of Reid was mourned by his many friends in the racing world, especially at Flemington, where he had left an indelible mark."

        "text": "The 1947–48 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 26th season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Eagles represent Boston College and were coached by John \"Snooks\" Kelley, in his 12th season.\nSeason.\nWith the NCAA instituting a college hockey tournament for the first time, BC had high hopes of being one of the two eastern teams invited to participate. Unfortunately, the Eagles had to contend with the absence of several key players early in the season. Star center Warren Lewis came down with an illness before the first game was played and was out of the lineup for their opening game against cross-town rival Harvard. His scoring touch was missed as BC fell to the Crimson 3–4. After two less-than-comfortable wins over Fort Devens State and MIT, the team lost their top two defensemen when Butch Songin and John Gallagher were injured in a car accident just before Christmas. However, by that time Warren Lewis had recovered and was back in the lineup. Filling in for the missing players were new additions Frank Shellenback and Ed Clasby but they could not make up for the missing defensive prowess.\nOver the succeeding five weeks, BC posted a mediocre 3–3 record and surrendered an average of 5 goals per game. It was only though the exploits of Mason, Lewis and Corcoran that allowed BC to remain in contention for the national tournament. Their biggest game during that stretch was against perennial powerhouse Dartmouth when they handed the Indians their first loss of the season. Songin returned just in time for the match against the green and was vital in keeping the high-powered Indians away from Bernie Burke and the BC cage. The reprieve was short-lived, however, as Songin missed several of the following games.\nThe three-game losing skid had BC in a precarious position, however, Ed Songin returned healthy in time for the game against New Hampshire, rejoining the team along with Gallagher. The result was an overwhelming victory over the Wildcats which began a streak of dominating play that would last until the end of the regular season. After slicing through the Georgetown Hoyas, BC shutout Fort Devens State in the rematch with both Burke and backup Norm Dailey getting a turn in the crease.\nBC ended the regular season with revenge wins over Harvard and Boston University in overwhelming fashion. In doing so they finished second in the NEIHL and appeared in the conference's first postseason tournament. They met Bowdoin in the Semifinal and eviscerated the Polar Bears 10–1 with a total team effort. In the championship game BC faced off against Northeastern, who had upset the top-seeded Terriers. The Eagles relied heavily on Burke to keep them in the game and their BC netminder faced a withering array of shots. He was up to the task and BC entered the third down just a goal. After the Huskies increased their lead to 2, BC rallied to score four consecutive goals in just over 6 minutes of game time to capture the championship.\nThe title, along with their stellar overall record, enabled BC to earn the second eastern bid for the inaugural NCAA tournament. They travelled to Colorado Springs and faced a powerful Michigan squad. The two teams proved to be the equal of one another as BC got three separate 1-goal leads only to see Michigan tie the score each time. The Wolverines earned their first lead of the match in the third period and jealously held on to the advantage as time ticked away. With under a minute to play, and Burke sitting on the bench in favor of a sixth skater, Jim Fitzgerald tied the game and sent the match into overtime. The NCAA rules at the time followed the original college hockey format that allowed for all 20 minutes of an overtime period to be played regardless of how many goals were scored. This meant that when Wally Gacek scored just 18 seconds into the extra period, BC still had a chance to win the game. Unfortunately, the Wolverines played a stingy defensive game for the rest of the contest and the Eagles were unable to tie the game. Instead, Gacek added a second marker with 30 seconds left in the 4th period, leaving the final score 4–6 in favor of Michigan. Because the NCAA changed the rules afterwards to mirror the more modern sudden-death rules, this was the only game in NCAA tournament history where more than one overtime goal was scored.\nRoster.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | NEIHL Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n&lt;br&gt;\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "Fort C. F. Smith was a bastion fort constructed in Warren County, Kentucky, between 1861 and 1865, as part of the Civil War defenses of Bowling Green, Kentucky (see Kentucky in the American Civil War). It was named in honor of General Charles Ferguson Smith, who died from a leg infection that was aggravated by dysentery on April 25, 1862.\nPart of a series of fortifications built to defend the city of Bowling Green, Fort C.F. Smith initially began construction under the supervision of the Confederate States of America, who occupied the city between September 1861 and February 1862. Construction was completed under the supervision of the Union Army after the city was captured by Union forces on February 15, 1862.\nHistory.\nCivil War.\nThe city of Bowling Green served as an important military stronghold for both Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. The city's position between Louisville, KY and Nashville, TN along the Louisville and Nashville Railroad made it a strategic defensive position midway along the Confederate line between Kentucky and Tennessee. On September 18, 1861, General Simon Bolivar Buckner occupied Bowling Green with 4,500 troops and began constructing a series of eight earthen fortifications on hills surrounding the town, including what would become Fort C.F. Smith. When Fort Henry and Fort Donelson were captured by Union forces in early February, 1862, the Confederate position in Bowling Green became untenable. As the Union Army approached, General Bolivar ordered his forces to evacuate the city on February 14, 1862. After occupying the city on February 15, Union forces continued construction on the city's incomplete fortifications. Fort C.F. Smith was completed in 1862 under the supervision of General Ormsby M. Mitchel and Colonel Benjamin Harrison, future 23rd President of the United States.\nPost-War.\nAbandoned by the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the war in 1865, the land was purchased by the City of Bowling Green in 1869 for use as a park and reservoir. Known locally as Reservoir Hill, the site has been continuously maintained as a neighborhood park.\nExisting remnants of the original earthen fortifications remain visible in the southwest portion of the park, though only approximately 10% of the fort's original construction have survived."

        "title": "History of Porin Ässät (men's ice hockey)",
        "text": "The history of the Porin Ässät starts in 1925, when Porin Palloilijat was established, even though PoPa is often considered as a separate club from Ässät.\nIn 1932, Porin Kärpät was established and six years later RU-38 started operations in sports. PoPa and Kärpät merged in 1960 to become the Porin Karhut. Only seven years after the establishment of Karhut, it merged with RU-38 to become Ässät.\nKarhut won the Finnish Championship of ice hockey in 1965. RU-38 won it two years later in 1967. Ässät claims neither of said championships.\nÄssät themselves have won three championships in ice hockey and one Finnish Cup.\n1925–1967: Before the establishment.\nÄssät's history in ice hockey can be traced back to the 1950s, when Porin Kärpät played their first official match in the Maakuntasarja. Ässät's history in other sports can be traced back to 1925, when PoPa was established.\nRU-38 was established in 1938 by Oy W. Rosenlew Ab.\nIn 1960, PoPa and Kärpät merged to form Porin Karhut. Both Kärpät and PoPa were re-established as independent clubs years after the merger. PoPa did not have any ice hockey programs and only played football and basketball. Kärpät also had bandy in its programme.\nIn the early 1960s, two clubs from Pori joined the SM-sarja: Karhut and RU-38. Both quickly rose to the top of the league and achieved success in the SM-sarja. Karhut won the Finnish championship in 1965, followed by RU-38 two years later in 1967. There was fierce competition between the two clubs both on and off the ice. The town was divided into the Karhut and RU-38 fan clubs; the Karhut were more popular because the majority of the people considered it the city's own club. The RU-38, on the other hand, was considered a Rosenlew factories-funded team, but it still had its own supporters. The relations between the clubs were not very good.\nEstablishment of Ässät (1967).\nAlthough the RU-38 won the Finnish championship in 1967, the Rosenlew company seriously considered giving up sports activities, as Rosenlew felt that hockey did not bring enough positive publicity to the company. The leaders of Karhut and RU-38 negotiated the unification of the clubs during the spring and early summer so secretly that even the insiders of the teams did not get to know about the merger negotiations. The problem for the Karhut was the economic downturn, as the club had heavily invested in player acquisitions. The income was not enough to cover the expenses, especially after some supporters had moved to the Rosenlew club.\nAs Rosenlew was abandoning the sports club, it was suggested that the RU-38 was simply \"melted\" into Karhut. When an agreement was finally reached, Rosenlew took over a large portion of Karhut's debts and promised to support the new team financially in the early years. The new club was named Porin Ässät. The birth of the club was announced at the end of June 1967. The name of the club was given by Vilho Santala, who acted as a negotiator in uniting the clubs and was elected the first chairman of Ässät. The club's logo was designed by Vesa Antikainen. The colors of the club were chosen as red, black and white.\nIn addition to hockey, the Ässät football team inherited RU-38's place in the Mestaruussarja, while Karhut continued to play as Ässät's secondary team until 1968. Ässät's football club was later disestablished in 1981.\n1967–1970: First seasons.\nThe early days of Ässät did not go smoothly, with Karhut and RU-38 players on the same team creating a heated atmosphere. The merger of the two top clubs also raised hopes of a very strong team, but one line of national team-level players joined different teams, and the players who left were mainly RU-38 players from the previous season. The first team of Ässät thus consisted mainly of Karhut players.\nThe first games of Ässät went well, and even before the start of the 1967 SM-sarja season, Ässät won the Suomen Cup championship. In the final match played in Savonlinna, SaPKo collapsed. Thanks to inheriting the RU-38 championship, Ässät also played in the 1968 European Cup, where it won its first two rounds before being beaten by SC Dynamo Berlin in the quarter-finals.\nIn its first season in the 1967–68 SM-sarja, Ässät placed fourth with Rauli Virtanen's coaching. The new club did not receive unreserved support from the people of Pori, as the number of spectators decreased by 10,000 from the last season of Karhut. In the second season of Ässät attendance started to rise, with the numbers rising to the same level as Karhut had. Lasse Heikkilä, the former coach of Karhut, became the coach for the second season and served as the team's coach until 1974 and later in 1976–1981. In the 1968–69 season, Ässät were again fourth. For the following season, 1969–70, Ässät suffered two heavy losses when Veli-Pekka Ketola and Alpo Suhonen left for Jokerit for a year. Ässät finished sixth in the series.\n1970–1971: First national championship.\nFor the season 1970–71, Ässät got a high-class returnee from Helsinki when Veli-Pekka Ketola returned to Pori after playing for one season in Jokerit. Alpo Suhonen also returned to Ässät after Ketola. Ketola's return to his home club gave rise to a huge training enthusiasm in other players as well, and coach Lasse Heikkilä took the team on a training trip to Moscow before the start of the season. The trip to the Soviet Union started training very early, by the standards of the time, because there was no ice on Pori in early autumn. In the 1970–71 season Ässät finished third in the regular season after Jokerit and HIFK. In the final series, everything fell into place, Ässät lost only one of their ten matches and overtook the Helsinki clubs ahead. The gold medals were finally secured by a five-point difference to the Jokerit who came in second. The first championship came under the leadership of the forward trio Erkki Väkiparta - Veli-Pekka Ketola - Tapio Koskinen. Other lines behind No. 1 were also able to provide to the team. There were also big names in the defense, such as Antti Heikkilä and Pekka Rautakallio. Veli-pekka Ketola was the highest point scorer in the SM-sarja during the 1970–71 season with 42 points, of which 25 were goals and 17 were assists. Ässät's captain during the season was Raimo Kilpiö. Ässät's number one goalie was Jorma Valtonen who played every game of the season. Valtonen finished the season with a .922 save percentage.\n1971–1977.\nNot much was expected from Ässät in the following seasons. Ässät remained the same after the championship season and an arena was built in Pori, but no lasting success was achieved. In the four seasons following the championship season, the club placed in the middle caste of the series and did not seek medals, but there was no threat of relegation either.\nNot was much expected for the 1975–76 season. The worst loss was Pekka Rautakallio's departure to North America. However, promising young people came to Ässät; Tapio Levo filled the gap left by Rautakallio. The net was blocked by the young Antero Kivelä. The young team of Ässät showed their potential in the series by beating the clubs that were predicted to be at top of the series. It was worst experienced by the future champion TPS, who Ässät beat 14–0. However, the access for Ässät to the top four in the playoffs was only decided in the final round against Lukko. In the semi-finals, Ässät challenged Tappara, who advanced to the finals 2–0. In the bronze matches against HIFK, Ässät's hunger for victory was greater and the team took the bronze winning the series 2–0.\nAt least as good a performance was expected for the following season, 1976–77, but Ässät remained fifth in the series and thus did not make the playoffs.\n1977–1987: Medal streak and the downfall.\nChampionship 1977–78.\nThe 1977–78 season again raised hopes of success when Pekka Rautakallio and Veli-Pekka Ketola returned to Ässät from North America. In addition, promising young people played in the club, such as Arto Javanainen, Kari Makkonen, Tapio Levo and Harry Nikander. Ässät finished second in the regular season after Tappara and defeated TPS 3–2 in the semi-finals. The final series against Tappara did not start promisingly, as Tappara won the first match in Tampere 8–0. However, Ässät won the rest of the games, and the club achieved its second Finnish Championship. The last match at the Porin jäähalli (now Isomäki Areena) was estimated to have been attended by more than 13,000 spectators, even though only 8,600 spectators should have been allowed into the arena at that time. There were more spectators in the auditorium than in any other previous hockey match played in Finland. In the early years of the SM-liiga in the second half of the 1970s, Ässät was one of the league's absolute top teams. The most important player on the team was the captain, center Veli-Pekka Ketola, who had returned from the North American WHA League. Ketola broke the point record in the playoffs at the time.\nSilver 1978–79.\nThe season that followed the championship, 1978–79, went as expected for Ässät in the regular season. The team won it by five points to Tappara. In the semifinals, Ässät knocked out HIFK with a win of 3-0 and advanced to the final against Tappara. Last year's finalists struggled again for the championship. The final series became a thrilling play. Tappara won the first two matches, Ässät the next two and the final series thus stretched to the fifth, decisive match. The match played in Pori ended with Tappara's 2–5 victory, so Ässät was left with silver.\nSilver 1979–80.\nIn the following season, 1979–80, Ässät were nowhere near the previous season in the regular season, finishing fourth. In the semi-finals, TPS was defeated by Ässät 3–1, winning the finals for the third time in a row. HIFK came up against Ässät. HIFK took the championship 3–0, so Ässät were silver medallists again.\nSilver 1983–84.\nAfter the silver seasons, Ässät suffered bad losses when Veli-Pekka Ketola went back to North America. Tapio Levo also joined the NHL. In addition, Risto Tuomi and Veli-Matti Ruisma went to the Swedish league and Erkki Väkiparta retired. In the following seasons, Ässät placed in the middle caste of the SM-Liiga. For the 1983–84 season, the team received well-known returnees when Tapio Levo returned from the NHL and Risto Tuomi and Harry Nikander from Sweden. The team was also strengthened by its own juniors, from whom more top players of the future were emerging; In addition to Javanainen and Levo, Kari Takko and Christian Ruuttu, among others. The team placed second in the regular season and beat Oulun Kärpät 3–2 in the semi-finals. In the finals, the opponent was again Tappara. The series was close. Ässät won the first match in overtime but Tappara took the next three. The overtime goal of the decisive match secured Tappara the championship with 3–1 victories.\n1984–1987.\nIn the following season, 1984–85, Ässät survived to the medal games, but still finished fourth. In the next three seasons, 1985–88, the team's success slowed down and Ässät were placed in the middle caste of the SM-liiga. However, access to the top four playoffs was only a few points away each time, so there was no threat of relegation. Ässät also saw the first foreigner in the 1986–87 season, when a Canadian Mark Jooris played in Pori for two seasons.\n1988–1990: New momentum from Division 1.\nFor the 1988–89 season, Ässät prepared without major goals. A handful of regular players left the team, and no new high-class players were acquired due to the tight economic situation, but playing time was given to young promises. Sean Toomey, Rejean Boivin and later Risto Tuomi were acquired from abroad to replace Brad Beck, who was acquired to replace this injury. The season started well, but as the series progressed, Ässät sank to the tail end of the league. In the final round, Ässät met Oulun Kärpät in the \"jumbo final\". The set-up was that with the win, Ässät would rise to tenth above the qualifying line and retain their place without qualifying. In any case, Kärpät had to play the qualification games. Kärpät won the match 2–1 and Ässät were the last in the series, having to qualify for their league place against JoKP. The qualifiers became a thrilling play. The first qualifying match in Joensuu ended bitterly for Ässät, JoKP won with an overtime goal. Ässät won the next match in Pori, but in Joensuu JoKP won again. Ässät won the fourth match at home again. In the decisive match, the club's veterans Levo, Makkonen and Nikander and a few others gave their all in front of their team, but the Yankee reinforcements acquired unnecessary coolers, and the spirit of the game was not entirely clear to everyone else from outside Pori. JoKP won the game 5–3 and Ässät fell to the I Division.\nHowever, relegation to Division I for the period 1989–90 raised the hockey boom in Pori as the townspeople stood behind their team. Audience numbers increased from previous league seasons as Ässät's excerpts were followed with interest. For the I Division season, Ässät received top confirmations when Arto Javanainen returned from TPS and Arto Heiskanen from Lukko. Alexei Frolikov and Vladimir Durdin from Riga Dynamo. Matti \"Mölli\" Keinonen became the coach. The division visit was only for the duration of the season. The aces were superior in the regular season, breaking numerous Division I records and progressing effortlessly to victory and league qualifiers in the series. In the qualifiers, JoKP was met. Ässät won the series 3-0 and returned to the SM-liiga.\n1990–1995: A new start with Vasily Tikhonov.\nÄssät did not celebrate their return to the SM-liiga for a long time, and the club immediately began preparing for the next season, 1990–91. Ässät had a Liiga-level team already during the I-divisioona times and the team body remained the same. A contract extension was signed with foreign players Alexei Frolikov and Vladimir Durdin, who proved to be strong players, but luck wasn't on Ässät's side as Durdin died in a car accident while on his way to his hometown Riga. Andrei Pyatanov from the Riga Dynamo was a replacement for Durdin. The most significant acquisition for the coming years was Jari Korpisalo from Karhu-Kissat. Matti Keinonen continued as coach. Re-learning to play Liiga-level hockey took the early part of the season. At times, the team played steadily against the top teams in the series but on the other hand often collapsed against the weaker ones. The club management decided to hire Vasily Tikhonov, the son of Viktor Tikhonov, the long-time coach of the Soviet hockey national team, as the coach to replace Keinonen. The rise of Ässät began immediately. It defeated the reigning champion TPS in the next match and eventually battled all the way for sixth place and the final playoffs, but was still two points behind.\nThe meager loss of the playoff spot lowered the morale of the team, and the target for the following season, 1991-92, was already set higher. There was potential, as the team's body consisted of experienced players: Arto Javanainen, Arto Heiskanen, Tapio Levo, Harry Nikander, Juha Jyrkkiö and Aleksei Frolikov. The team also had good young players, such as Jokke Heinänen, Rauli Raitanen, Janne Virtanen, Olli Kaski and Jari Levonen. A new Latvian player was acquired again when Pyatanov was replaced by Andrei Matitsin. Promising young people were acquired from Division I when Petri Varis came from KooKoo and Jouni Vento from FoPS. Ässät also got a high class player when goalie Kari Takko returned from the NHL to his home club. In the second Liiga season after the promotion, Tikhonov's coaching was on the rise, with the Ässät finishing fifth in the regular season and taking out Lukko in the playoffs. Ässät advanced to the semi-finals against Jokerit. Ässät had to fight fiercely against Jokerit, whose brightest star was the young Teemu Selänne. Ässät won both of their home games and thus stretched to the fifth game of the series, but in the decisive battle, Jokerit was the better in the final with a 5–0 win. In the bronze medal game, HIFK took the medals with a 2–0 win, so Ässät finished fourth in the second post-division season.\nFor the 1993–94 season Ässät lost coach Vasily Tikhonov to the San Jose Sharks. The new coach was former Ässät player Veli-Pekka Ketola. Ketola's merits as a player were great, but his coaching skills were highly questioned. Doubts were dampened when Ässät finished second in the regular season. The performance was quite good, as the team had weakened a bit with the departure of Petri Varis. In the semi-finals, äsät and Tappara met. Tappara wom Ässät in the first two games. Ässät managed to level the wins to 2–2, but Tappara won the last match 1–4 and, to the disappointment of the Pori crowd, advanced to the semi-finals.\nÄssät suffered significant losses just before the 1994–95 season, when Olli Kaski left for Sweden, Vjačeslavs Fanduļs went to TPS and Arto Javanainen moved to Denmark to end his successful career. Ässät does not remain idle. Veli-Pekka Ketola's job description was expanded from coaching to the role of general manager. Ässät replaced the lost players with Timo Nykopp, Harri Laurila and Teppo Kivelä, as well as Czech players Jaroslav Otevřel and Jiri Veber. Pasi Peltonen, who later had a long career in Ässät, was also raised from the juniors. Ässät finished sixth in the regular season and dropped HIFK 3.0 from the playoffs. In the semi-finals against Jokerit, Ässät only lost their home game in overtime, but in the Helsinki games the Jokerit was overwhelmingly superior and progressed deservedly to the final. Ässät played for the bronze medal against Satakunta's local opponent Lukko. The winners of the match played in Rauma were Ässät with 3 goals, so the bronze medals ended up in Ässät.\n1995–2001.\nAfter the bronze season in 1995–96, Ässät was considered to be the number one challenger to TPS and Jokerit, who already dominated the SM-liiga. New reinforcements were Pekka Virta and Tomáš Kapusta. Ässät's effective number one line, consisting of Jari Korpisalo, Tomáš Kapusta and Jaroslav Otevřel, was unbeatable, but the line broke down after Kapusta was injured in the middle of the season. Ässät started the season with a winning streak and everything looked good. However, Jokerit and TPS were far ahead of other teams, but Ässät were firmly in third place until the final meters. However, the situation changed in February 1996, when the match against JyP HT in Pori was the most serious accident in the history of the SM-liiga, when Ässät's Otevřel was seriously injured. There were only seven rounds left in the regular season, but Ässät's players who were shocked by the incident had lost their desire to play and Ässät won two more matches during the season. In the semi-finals, TPS defeated Ässät straight, winning 3–0.\nAfter the 1997–98 season, Ässät's playing success no longer carried the team into the playoffs, and the following years were quite a toddler at every level of the organization. Bankruptcy was not far off, and senior officials were arrested on suspicion of tax evasion, although charges were subsequently dropped. The base quotation was the season 2000–01, when Ässät were the last in the league.\n2005–06: Back to the finals.\nWith the club's toddler, the fanatical audience in Pori had time to level off due to the team's weak performances, until the hockey boom was revived in the 2005–06 season with the success of Ässät. The team survived fifth in the regular season, with Marko Kivenmäki and Kristian Kuusela as their brightest stars. The team also included enterprising promising young people such as Jesse Joensuu and Leo Komarov. Ässät first surprised Tappara, who was the favorite in the quarterfinals, with a 4–2 match win. In the semi-finals, the champion favorite Oulun Kärpät met. Ässät won the series 3-1 and advanced to the final after a 22-year break. In the final series against HPK, Ässät's efforts were no longer enough, and HPK won the championship 3–1. Winged by surprising success, the Pori hockey boom helped the club rise from years of financial distress.\n2009–2010.\nÄssät started the 2009–10 season under the coaching of a new head coach, Pekka Rautakallio, a former Ässät player and former NHL player. Until the end of January, the team was very much involved in the battle for a direct playoff spot in the top six, but the season ended in 13th place. On the junior side, all age groups made it to the playoff games and the B-juniors achieved bronze medals.\n2012–2013: Surprise championship.\nThe 2012–13 season went differently for Ässät. It started the season strongly, but by the turn of the year had fallen below the playoff line. The team sold its No. 1 center, Stephen Dixon to a KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. At the end of January Ässät started the longest winning streak in their history, ending only in the last previous round of the regular season with an overtimetime loss against Oulu Kärpät. The standings rose to twelfth to fourth. In the quarterfinals, Ässät won KalPa 4–1. Semifinals against JyP Ässät started with an overtime win when Michael Ryan scored the winning time in 92.51. Ässät won the second match in Pori 2–0 and the third in Jyväskylä 1–4. JyP narrowed the situation with their 1–2 away victory, but Ässät won the fifth match 0-1 and advanced to the finals. Tappara won the first final 2–1 after Jukka Peltola scored five seconds before the end of the regular time. The second final match in Pori was won by Ässät 5–1. In the third match, Tappara was better with 3-2 goals, and the winning goal was scored by Niclas Lucenius just one second before the end of the actual game time. Ässät won the fourth match 4–0 in their home arena. In the fifth final match, Ässät took the away victory with goals 1–2. Veli-Matti Savinainen finished the winning goal from Ville Uusitalo's pass in the third overtime in 108.59. The match was the longest final match in SM-liiga history and the third longest in all playoffs. Ässät won the Finnish Championship after winning Tappara in the sixth final 3–2 with Jyri Marttinen's goal, and at the same time the whole series was won by Ässät 4–2. The Pori team had won their previous championship in 1978. A real generational change was seen after the match, when the captain of the 1978 championship team, Veli-Pekka Ketola, came on the ice to hand over the Kanada malja to captain Ville Uusitalo.\n2013–2019: After the championship.\n2013–14.\nIn the season following the championship, Ässät was coached by Pekka Virta. Ässät signed a former NHL forward Niklas Hagman. The team played variedly, being well involved in the competition for a playoff spot until the November World Championships break. After that, however, a downturn began, from which the team no longer recovered and they ended the season in 12th place in the regular season.\n2014–15.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Pekka Rautakallio returned to the Ässät. The team started the season with a young team and played in the regular season variably except for the losing streak in October and February. During autumn, Ässät lost the lead several times in the third period, losing in regular time or overtime. Ässät finished 9th in the regular season and faced SaiPa in the 1st round of the playoffs. SaiPa sent Ässät directly to the summer holidays in two games.\n2015–16.\nIn the beginning of the 2015–16 season, Ässät had to start with a long guest tour. The team clearly picked up after the start of the home games and was well involved in the playoff competition until the end of January, when it started to lag behind. Mikael Kotkaniemi replaced Pekka Rautakallio as the coach of Ässät in mid-February. In the following season, Jyrki Aho took over the lead responsibility for the team.\n2016–17.\nIn the 2016–17 season, Ässät signed many new players. The team did well, ranking directly to the playoffs for most of the season. At the end of the regular season, however, Ässät were unable to secure a direct playoff spot. In the first round of the playoffs, Tampereen Ilves settled, who sent Ässät to the summer holidays with a win of 1–3.\n2017–18.\nIn the 2017–18 season, Ässät were renewed more. Jesperi Kotkaniemi was put in the Liiga line-up from the U20 league. During the World Championship break in November, Ässät strengthened their team with high-class returnees when Jarno Kärki, who moved to Tappara at the end of the previous season, and Sakari Salminen, who had played abroad for many years, returned. In January, Tommi Taimi returned to Ässät. Ässät were among the top six in the regular season throughout the autumn season, returning to 4th place after the Christmas break. The course of Ässät improved and the team started to win again, finishing in 8th place at the end of the regular season. Ässät sent Lukko directly to the summer holidays with a win of 2–0 and advanced to the semi-finals against Oulun Kärpät. In the series against Kärpät, Ässät were able to challenge them, but the Kärpät eventually won the series 4–1.\n2018–19.\nAfter the 2017–19 season, Ässät lost four defencemen and eight forwards. Ässät replaced the lost players with four forwards and two defenceman and additionally signed two junior players, Juuso Ketola and Otto Kivenmäki to professional contracts. In September 2018, Ässät took Severi Sillanpää and Tuomas Huhtanen on one month long try-out contracts. In October, Ässät signed a two-year contract with defenceman Jyri Marttinen, after he had terminated his contract with the Rauman Lukko. Ässät finished last place in the series with 47 points. Ässät's leader in points was Sakari Salminen with 31.\n2022–present: Rebuild.\nAfter Ässät finished 15th (last) place in the 2021-22 season, Ässät started a rebuild by firing their coach, Ari-pekka Selin and hiring Karri Kivi and Jere Härkälä.\nBack to the playoffs: 2022–2023.\nÄssät signed players considered as top tier players like Jesse Joensuu, Roope Talaja, Jan-Mikael Järvinen, Ian McCoshen, Dominic Turgeon, Niklas Rubin and Joachim Rohdin. Ässät also picked up some of their own junior players from the U20 league. Ässät also published their future plans like the player budgets for example. Ässät named Jesse Joensuu as captain. Alexander Ruuttu, Niklas Appelgren and Jan-Mikael Järvinen were named as assistant captains. Ässät hired a new sports manager, Janne Vuorinen, to replace Tommi Kerttula.\nÄssät started the 2022–23 season by winning the Pitsiturnaus tournament for the first time since 2004. Ässät's first regular season game was against Ilves, Ässät lost 3–0. Ässät's first victory came at a home in a game against JYP HT, Ässät won 5–0. The first Satakunnan derby game was played in the West Areena on 21 October 2022, the game ended in Lukko's 2–6 victory.\nOn February 13, Ässät announced that it had signed goaltender Cody Porter to a contract covering the rest of the season due to Niklas Rubin's injury on 8 February. Porter was later sent back to RoKi on a loan.\nOn 4 March 2023, Ässät secured a playoff spot with a 2–1 win against Lukko in the last Satakunta derby of the regular season. Ässät and Lukko played 6 regular season games against each other with 3–3 wins and 9–9 points.\nÄssät finished 8th in the regular season with 91 points and faces HC TPS in the first round of the playoffs in a best-of-three series. Ässät beat TPS in the first game 2–1. TPS beat Ässät in the 2nd game 2–1. TPS scored their winning goal in the last minutes of the third period after a rather questionable penalty when TPS player Taneli Ronkainen pushed Ässät player Emil Erholtz on TPS goaltender Lassi Lehtinen, which got Erholtz a 2 minute penalty, during which TPS scored their goal. The linesman director of Liiga, Jyri Rönn, admitted the mistake and apologized to Ässät after the incident. Ässät beat TPS in the last game 2–1 and will face Ilves in the 2nd round.\nÄssät's first game against Ilves ended in a 5–1 loss. The second game ended in Ässät's 5–2 victory. Ilves beat Ässät 4–1 in the third and the fourth game. Ässät's season came to an end after a 3–2 loss against Ilves.\nCurrent season (2023–24).\nÄssät started the work on the 2023–24 season by promoting Jere Härkälä to head coach. On 4 April 2023, Ässät's sporting manager announced that it did not use the additional year on Eemeli Virtanen' and Samuli Aaltonen's 2+1 style contracts, but it did use Will Graber's additional year on his 1+1 contract. On the same article it was told that Ässät's training would start on 2 May 2023 and all contracts would be published throughout April. Ässät's elite goaltender, Niklas Rubin, had already signed a one year extension to his contract during the 2022–23 season. Defenceman Nikolas Matinpalo extended his contract by two years, but he signed a one-year deal with the Ottawa Senators. Jami Virtanen also signed a two-year extension.

He won two National Championships with Minnesota Duluth in 2018 and 2019.\nPlaying career.\nKrieger attended Saint Thomas Academy, a Catholic military academy near his home town, and played on the ice hockey team for three years. After graduating in 2012, he continued his junior hockey career first with the Aberdeen Wings and then the Waterloo Black Hawks. After being a point per game scorer for nearly that entire five-year period, Krieger headed up to Alaska to begin his college career.\nHe debuted for the Nanooks in 2014, however, due to prior NCAA recruiting violations, Alaska was ineligible for the postseason that year. With Alaska eligible for the playoffs in his sophomore season, Krieger began to show the scoring touch he had possessed in juniors and led the club with 16 assists. Unfortunately, the Nanooks fell from 4th to 8th in the standings and were swept out in the first round.\nAfter his second year, Krieger decided to transfer closer to home and join Minnesota Duluth. He sat out the next season per NCAA transfer requirements and then played his first game as a Bulldog in 2017. Krieger saw his goal totals explode with his new team, scoring nearly three times his totals as a sophomore. Krieger finished second on the team with 30 points, however, it was on the defensive end where Duluth made its name. UMD was one of the top teams in the country and, though they had a slightly disappointing regular season, they were still able to earn one of the final at-large bids for the NCAA tournament. Krieger helped his team earn four consecutive 1-goal victories to capture the National Championship. Krieger's scoring declined slightly in his final season but it didn't hurt the Bulldogs as UMD won a second consecutive NCAA championship. \nWith his college tenure now over, Krieger headed to Sweden to kick of his professional career. He joined Västerviks IK of the second Swedish league and finished in a tie for the team lead in goals. Västerviks made the postseason that year, however, the playoffs were abruptly ended on March 15 due to the Coronavirus pandemic.\nKrieger returned to North America and played with the Indy Fuel during the abbreviated 'Covid year'. He performed well enough to earn a stint with the Manitoba Moose but ended up finishing the year in the ECHL.\nAfter things returned to normal following the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Krieger travelled back across the Atlantic. He spent the 21-22 season with HKM Zvolen and led the club in both goals and points (tied). After helping Zvolen to a second-place finish in the regular season, Krieger was again their top scorer in the playoffs but couldn't prevent them from bring eliminated in the semifinals. After the year, Krieger was again on the move and signed with HC Vítkovice Ridera of the ELH on May 4, 2023."

First-time tournament medalists Lativa won silver and Finland rounded out the medal table with bronze. Germany, Slovakia, and tournament host Italy placed fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively.\nThe Swiss team featured the top seven point scorers of the tournament: scoring leader Joel Grossniklaus, who scored 2 goals and 6 assists for 8 points; followed by Yannik Ponzetto and Loris Wey, who both tallied 7 points on 2 goals and 5 assists; Daniil Ustinkov, the tournament's top scoring defenseman, and Jordan Forget, who both notched a goal and 5 assists; David Bosson, who scored 4 goals and 1 assist; and Jamiro Reber, who recorded 3 goals and 2 assists.

In the preliminary round rematch between the 2022 gold medal match teams, Sweden onceagain pushed the Czech Republic to overtime before ultimately losing in the shootout. With the overtime loss as the only blemish on their record, Sweden finished second in Group B. Continuing in dramatic fashion, Sweden tied the score against Finland in the last five minutes of regulation to push the bronze medal game to overtime. After a scoreless overtime period, Abigail Byskata scored the lone goal of the shootout to solidify Finland's second consecutive bronze medal victory.\nAustria and Italy both made their EYOF girls' ice hockey debuts in 2023, making the fifth place game a matchup between two tournament newcomers.

Play resumed at 7:00 am EST on Friday.\nBryson DeChambeau made three birdies over his final nine holes to shoot 66 (−4) and move atop the leaderboard at the end of the first round.\nEric Cole, making his PGA Championship debut after getting into the field as an alternate, made three straight birdies on holes 2–4 and was alone in first place at five under when play was halted. He double-bogeyed the sixth hole (his 15th) on Friday morning to drop back to three under and a shot behind DeChambeau. Scottie Scheffler did not make a bogey in a round of 67 to join Cole in a tie for second place, along with Dustin Johnson who was tied with DeChambeau until a bogey on the 18th. Adam Scott also got to four under until a double bogey on the 18th dropped back to two under and a four-way tie for sixth place that included 2011 champion Keegan Bradley.\nDefending champion Justin Thomas made a double bogey on the sixth hole and shot two-over 72 in his opening round. World No. 1 Jon Rahm made six bogeys, including on his final three holes, and a double bogey as he began the tournament with a six-over 76.\nSource:\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, May 19, 2023\"\nCorey Conners, Viktor Hovland, and Scottie Scheffler tied for the lead through 36 holes at five under. Scheffler, one back at the start of the round, birdied the first hole after hitting his approach to within two feet. He bogeyed the seventh hole, his first bogey of the tournament, before hitting his tee shot on the par-three 15th hole to a foot for a birdie and a share of the lead with Conners. A closing bogey dropped Scheffler back to five under after a two-under round of 68.\nConners was three under on his round and alone in first place at six under before a bogey at the seventh hole (his 16th) to match Scheffler's 68. Hovland birdied his first two holes, including holing a 20-foot putt on the second, then made another 18-footer for birdie at the 10th. At the 18th, Hovland hit his approach to five feet and made the putt for a closing birdie and a 67 (−3). It was Hovland's 10th consecutive major championship round inside the top 10 on the leaderboard.\nFirst-round leader Bryson DeChambeau double-bogeyed the sixth hole after hitting his approach shot into a greenside bunker and fell as many as five shots off the lead before making three birdies on the back nine to get back to four under. He found another bunker on the 18th and made bogey to fall to three under, two shots back of the lead. Justin Suh joined him in a tie for fourth place after making a 33-foot birdie putt on the eighth hole, his 17th.\nTwo-time champion Brooks Koepka made five birdies on his closing nine holes, including both the 17th and 18th, to shoot a four-under 66 and climb into a tie for sixth place at two under. Michael Block, a club pro in California, was three under on his round before a bogey at the par-5 fourth hole and double bogey on the par-3 fifth after his tee shot struck a tree. He finished at even par and tied for 10th place, the first PGA professional to be inside the top 10 after the second round since 1988.\nThe cut came at 145 (+5), with 76 players making it to the weekend. Defending champion Justin Thomas needed a seven-foot putt to save bogey on the 18th hole and make the cut on the number, as did two-time champion Phil Mickelson. Notables to miss the cut included 2015 champion Jason Day and reigning U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick.\nSource:\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, May 20, 2023\"\nTwo-time champion Brooks Koepka shot a second consecutive round of 66 (−4) to take the 54-hole lead. Koepka made three birdies on the back nine, including a 46-foot putt on the 17th to reach six under for the tournament and a shot ahead of Corey Conners and Viktor Hovland.\nConners, part of a three-way tie for the lead at the start of the round, reached seven under after a birdie at the par-3 15th hole. At the 16th, he drove into a bunker off the tee then had his second shot embed in the bank, leading to a double bogey that dropped him back to five under and an even-par round of 70. Hovland was two-over on his round before making three birdies in a five-hole span from 8-12. He holed an 18-footer for birdie at the 11th, then hit his approach on the 12th to four feet and made the putt to tie Conners for the lead at six under. He failed to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker on the 18th for a closing bogey, matching Conners' 70.\nBryson DeChambeau double-bogeyed the sixth hole after finding water off the tee and also bogeyed the par-5 13th to fall to two-over on his round. He rebounded with birdie on the short par-4 14th after driving near the green, then hit his approach on the 15th to seven feet for another birdie to shoot 70 and finish alone in fourth place at three under, three shots off the lead. Scottie Scheffler, tied with Conners and Hovland for the lead at the start of the round, made four bogeys on his front nine and did not make his first birdie until the 14th as he fell back with a three-over 73, ending up in a tie for fifth place at two under.\nClub pro Michael Block shot even-par 70 for the third consecutive round and was tied for eighth place, becoming the first PGA professional to be inside the top 10 after the third round since Jay Overton in 1988.\nSource:\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, May 21, 2023\"\nSummary.\nBrooks Koepka shot a final-round 67 to win his third PGA Championship and fifth major championship by two shots over Viktor Hovland and Scottie Scheffler.\nBeginning the round with a one-stroke lead, Koepka made three straight birdies to increase the gap to three shots after four holes. He hit his tee shot on the sixth hole into the hazard and made his first bogey of the round, then made another bogey on the seventh when his approach shot hung in the rough around a greenside bunker. Koepka rebounded with birdies on the 10th and 12th, holing a 10-foot putt from just off the green, to offset another bogey on the par-3 11th after his tee shot plugged in a bunker.\nHovland, meanwhile, made two birdies on the front nine including a 17-foot putt on the par-3 fifth hole as he stayed within one shot of Koepka's lead making the turn. He also birdied the 13th and 14th to go three under on his round and was still a shot behind Koepka heading to the 16th. He hit his tee shot into a fairway bunker, then had his second shot embed in the bank forcing him to take a drop and settle for a double bogey. Koepka birdied the hole after hitting his approach inside five feet as he opened up a four-shot lead with just two holes to play. Despite a bogey on the 17th, Koepka was able to two-putt for par on the 18th to finish at nine under.\nScottie Scheffler made four birdies on the back nine and got within two shots of Koepka's lead as he shot a five-under 65, tying the lowest round of any player in the tournament, to tie Hovland for second place. Scheffler's finish coupled with Jon Rahm's T50 finish returned Scheffler to world number one. Corey Conners, who began the round a shot off the lead, made seven bogeys in a five-over 75 to fall into a tie for 12th place. Club pro Michael Block made a hole-in-one on the 15th hole and shot 71 (+1), his tie for 15th place the best finish by a PGA professional since 1986.\nScorecard.\nSource:"

Following a good showing against Boston University, the Wildcats got their revenge over the Huskies with an 8–5 win. After a second loss to BU, UNH knocked off Norwich to put themselves into contention for the inaugural NEIHL tournament.

To support the team, a temporary rink was built behind Fernald Hall and ex-pro player Thomas Filmore was brought in helm the team. Despite their best intentions, the program had to deal with some significant hurdles. Not least of which were that virtually none of the players had played college hockey before. Additionally, because they had started putting their schedule together so late in the school year, the Aggies had trouble getting other teams on their slate. However, the biggest issue was probably the lack of practice facilities. While the Fernald Hall Rink had been built in earnest, weather conditions rendered it unsuitable for long swaths of time. UMass was able to schedule six games, however, half of those were cancelled. After the first game on January 6 was scrapped, the team played a pair of contest just before the exam break and a third upon return.

David Brown, owing to this powerful physique, is better than Marshall in getting clear of a mess whether of his own, or another's making. It was noticeable at Murrayfield that Brown was able to kick for touch even when an opponent was on top of him, and usually it was the opponent that was bowled over by the impact.\nThe Herald went on to note that neither full back was perfect, Brown could have done with Marshall's agility and pace; and Marshall could have used Brown's weight and power. Nevertheless, despite the Possibles 21-9 defeat, it was Brown that the selectors chose for international recognition, with Marshall having to wait to the following year for his selection.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 3 times for in 1933.\nHe won all three matches he played and guided Scotland to the triple crown that year.\nFamily.\nHis father was Robert Charles Brown, born in Buenos Aires, from a Berwickshire family; his mother Agnes Jane Collart (1867-1938) from Kells in Kirkcudbright.\nDavid had 2 brothers and 2 sisters."

        "title": "2023 Northeast Conference men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2023 Northeast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the Northeast Conference for the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The tournament took place on three dates between March 1 and 7, 2023, and all tournament games were played in the home arenas of the higher-seeded school. The winner, Merrimack, did not receive the conference's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament due to not being eligible because of a transition from Division II. Instead, the runner-up, Farleigh Dickinson, was awarded the conference's automatic bid by winning the seminfinal game over Saint Francis (PA).\nThere was no defending champion for the 2023 tournament, as Bryant moved to the America East Conference after the 2021–22 academic year.\nSeeds.\nAll eight eligible teams of the nine members of the conference qualified. Effective for the 2022–23 academic year, NEC teams transitioning from Division II became eligible for the NEC tournament during their third and fourth years of the transition period. If a reclassifying institution won the NEC tournament championship, the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament went to the NEC tournament runner up. The conference's rule change regarding reclassifying institutions resulted in Merrimack being eligible for the 2023 NEC tournament, since it was in its fourth transition year.\nTeams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.\nStonehill College joined the Northeast Conference from the Division II Northeast-10 Conference. Stonehill is ineligible for the NCAA tournament until the 2026–27 season during its four-year reclassification period and won't be eligible for the NEC tournament until the 2024–25 season.\nTournament notes.\nQuarterfinals.\nZiggy Reid had a career-high 33 points, including 20 in the first half, to lead Merrimack to a 91–76 quarterfinal win over LIU. Reid shot 11 for 13 from the field, including 6 for 7 from three-point range, and added nine rebounds for the Warriors, who led 54–33, at halftime. Midway through the first half, Merrimack stretched a six-point lead to 18 with a 12–0 run, which started and concluded with three-pointers by Reid. Javon Bennett scored 26 points on 10-for-13 shooting, including 4 for 5 from beyond the arc, and added three steals for the Warriors, while Jordan Minor contributed 17 points, five rebounds, five steals, four blocks and two assists. Jacob Johnson had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Sharks.\nIn what would prove to be the final men's basketball game in the history of St. Francis Brooklyn, Fairleigh Dickinson scored the first seven points and led wire to wire to complete a season sweep of three games over the Terriers with an 83–75 victory. The Knights were led by Sean Moore and Ansley Almonor, who scored 18 points each. Almonor shot 7 for 11, including 4 for 6 from three-point range, and added five rebounds. Moore had seven rebounds and five steals for Fairleigh Dickinson. The Knights' biggest lead was 16, at 30–14, in the first half, and they led, 45–30, at halftime. St. Francis Brooklyn cut the deficit to four points with 1:48 to play, after an 11–4 run, led by redshirt freshman Zion Bethea, but the Knights hit their free throws down the stretch. Bethea and Tedrick Wilcox Jr. finished with 17 points each for the Terriers. Wilcox added six assists and three steals.\nJosh Cohen's 25 points and 12 rebounds led Saint Francis (PA) past Central Connecticut, 83–69. Trailing 26–24, the Red Flash got eight points from Ronell Giles, Jr. during a 15–2 run that helped them secure a 39–30 lead at the break. Cohen had 15 of his points in the first half. After Saint Francis pushed their lead to 14, at 51–37 with 14:26 to play, the Blue Devils got no closer than an 11-point deficit the rest of the way. Maxwell Land scored 23 points, on 9-for-15 shooting, and Giles finished with 14 points for the Red Flash. Jayden Brown and Kellen Amos each scored 13 points for Central Connecticut. Brown added six rebounds and two blocks. Andre Snoddy contributed 12 points and 12 rebounds for the Blue Devils.\nTanner Thomas and Nico Galette scored 14 points each to lead Sacred Heart to a 67–55 victory over Wagner. The Pioneers used a 10–2 run to expand their 46–44 lead and go up by 10 points with 5:45 to play. Thomas added eight rebounds for Sacred Heart. Brandon Brown scored 15 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to lead the Seahawks.\nSemifinals.\nJordan Minor had 18 points, 12 rebounds, four steals, and six blocks to lead Merrimack to a 71–60 victory over Sacred Heart. With the game tied at 9, Devon Savage, who had eight points in the first half, hit a layup and a three-pointer to put the Warriors ahead for good. A Minor layup extended Merrimack's lead to 23–13. The Pioneers used a 7–0 run late in the first half to pull within a single point, but baskets by Javon Bennett and Jordan Derkack in the closing moments gave the Warriors a 33–28 lead at the break. Merrimack put the game away with a 14–3 run in the second half, which included two dunks by Minor and gave them a 60–43 lead with 6:24 to play. Bennett had 17 points, five assists and six steals for the Warriors. Sacred Heart got 15 points, 13 rebounds and two blocks from Tanner Thomas. Nico Galette added 13 points and seven rebounds, and Bryce Johnson had 12 points, 14 rebounds and two steals for the Pioneers.\nSince the NEC's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Tournament was given to the tournament runner-up, if an ineligible team won the NEC Tournament, Merrimack's victory in the semifinals, which was completed before the second semifinal between Fairleigh Dickinson and Saint Francis (PA) began, meant that both teams knew that the winner of their semifinal game would get the automatic bid. In the closing minutes of a tight first half, Fairleigh Dickinson went on an 8–2 run to build a 10-point lead, but Maxwell Land's buzzer-beating deep three-pointer left the Knights up by 35–28 at halftime. Fairleigh Dickinson took control of the game in the opening minutes of the second half and built a 45–30 lead. A 9–2 run extended the Knights' lead from 12 to 19 points. Josh Cohen, who finished with 12 points and eight rebounds, fueled an 8–0 Red Flash run that cut the Fairleigh Dickinson lead to 12 points with 6:06 to play, but Saint Francis got no closer the rest of the way, and the Knights cruised to a 70–50 victory that clinched a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Demetre Roberts had a game-high 18 points and added five assists for Fairleigh Dickinson, while Ansley Almonor contributed 15 points and seven rebounds. Land finished the game with 13 points, including three three-pointers, for the Red Flash.\nFinal.\nWith the NEC's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament already settled, the top two seeds in the tournament, Merrimack and Fairleigh Dickinson, met for the conference tournament championship. The Warriors closed the game on an 8–0 run, capped by a Jordan McKoy free through with 8.3 seconds remaining, that gave them a 67–66 lead. After McKoy missed his second free throw, Demetre Roberts dribbled up the floor but was long on a contested three-pointer from the top of the key at the buzzer, sealing the victory and first NEC tournament title for Merrimack. The game featured 11 lead changes during the first 37 minutes and was close throughout, but a Grant Singleton three-pointer gave the Knights a 66–59 lead, their largest of the game, with 2:59 to play. Tournament MVP Ziggy Reid scored a three-point basket 16 seconds after Singleton's shot. Jordan Minor then tied the game at 66 with 39.7 seconds left with a free-throw that completed a three-point play. On the ensuing possession, Singleton drove the lane and passed to Ansley Almonor in the corner for a three-point attempt that was long. McKoy was fouled on the rebound, setting up his winning free throw. Reid scored a game-high 23 points and added six rebounds. Minor had 19 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots for the Warriors. Roberts led the Knights with 15 points and six assists, and Cameron Tweedy added 13 points off the bench.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=BracketGraphic /&gt;Teams were reseeded after each round with highest remaining seeds receiving home-court advantage.\nAwards and honors.\nTournament MVP: Ziggy Reid"

        "title": "Zhang Boxing (Qing dynasty)",
        "text": "Zhang Boxing (, 15 January 1652 – 28 February 1723) was a Han Chinese politician and scholar in the Qing dynasty.\nBiography.\nZhang was a native of Yifeng, Henan. He was awarded a \"jinshi\" degree in the imperial examination of 1685, becoming a secretary in the Grand Secretariat in 1692. He returned home early in 1695 after his father's death and spent the next few years of his life teaching and studying. In 1699, Zhang led local efforts to combat flooding after a dike in the Yellow River burst and flooded Yifeng. His work caught the attention of the director-general of River Conservancy, Zhang Pengge, who subsequently tasked Zhang with supervising seventy miles of repairs. He was then made intendant of the Jining Circuit, Shandong, where he helped relieve famine and floods in 1703. Three years later, Zhang was appointed judicial commissioner in Jiangsu before becoming governor of Fujian in 1707 and receiving a special commendation from the emperor. As governor, he quickly relieved famines in three districts in Formosa and stabilized the price of grain in Fujian. In addition, Zhang paid special attention to education, establishing academies and converting temples into free schools.\nZhang continued his work fighting floods and famine when he became governor of Jiangsu in 1710. However, his reputation for integrity and clean government soon put him at odds with his superior, Gali, the Manchu governor-general of the province. According to historian R. Guy Kent, 'Both officials broke the code of silence, indicting each other in one of the loudest and most colorful exchanges of official broadsides in the early eighteenth century.' Among other offences, Gali accused Zhang of dereliction of duty and reading on the job while Zhang claimed his Manchu superior accepted bribes from juren candidates in the provincial examinations.\nTheir famously heated conflict eventually led to the establishment of a commission charged with investigating the accusations they made against each other. Although Zhang was sentenced to death by the Ministry of Justice, his honest character convinced the emperor to dismiss the unfavourable reports made against him. While both Gali and Zhang were officially dismissed, the latter was allowed to remain at his post. In 1715, Zhang was summoned to Beijing. The emperor appointed him to the Imperial Study and also made him acting superintendent of government granaries. In 1720, Zhang was made vice-president of the Board of Revenue, which he served concurrently with his role as superintendent of granaries. He was made Minister of Rites by the Yongzheng Emperor in 1723. He died in 1725 and was honoured with the posthumous name \"Qīngkè\" (淸恪‎) and the title of Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent. In 1878, Zhang was further honoured with his name's inclusion in the Temple of Confucius.\nLiterature.\nDuring his life, Zhang wrote fourteen titles noted in the Imperial Catalogue, mostly concerning philosophy and ethics. He was an avid proponent of Zhu Xi's work and edited two collections of major works of Song dynasty philosophy. He also published a work on river conservancy."

The tennis tournaments will feature six rounds in the men's and women's singles, five in the men's and women's doubles (draw size of 32), and four in the mixed doubles (draw size of 16). The players and pairs advancing to the semifinal stage will guarantee their medal contention with the two losing semifinalists competing for a bronze medal. All singles matches will be best of three sets with a standard tiebreak (first to seven points) in every set, including the final set. In all doubles competitions, a match tiebreak (first to ten points) will be contested instead of a third set. The Paris 2024 event is the first Olympic clay court event since the Barcelona 1992 event was played at Tennis de la Vall d'Hebron. It will also be the first Olympic tournament to be played on a natural surface and the first at a Grand Slam venue since the London 2012 event was staged at the Wimbledon Championships venue, the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.\nQualification.\nTo be eligible for Paris 2024, a tennis player must satisfy the key criteria to play on Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup teams. The qualification pathway for the singles tournaments is primarily based on the ATP and WTA rankings of June 10, 2024, with 56 players entering each of the men's and women's singles (limited to four per National Olympic Committee (NOC)). Six of the remaining eight slots are attributed to the NOCs with no other qualified tennis players across five continental zones (two for the Americas and one each for the rest). The final two spots are reserved, one for the host nation France and the other for the previous Olympic gold medalist or Grand Slam champion. In the men's and women's doubles tournaments, thirty-two places will offer for the highest-ranked teams with ten of them reserved for players in the top ten of the doubles rankings, who could select his or her partner from their NOC ranked in the top 300 of either singles or doubles. The remaining spots are attributed through the combined rankings with a preference given to the singles players once the total quota is filled. One team per gender is reserved for the host nation France if none has already become eligible otherwise. With no quota places available for the mixed doubles, all teams will consist of players already entered in either the singles or doubles, including the top 15 combined ranking teams and the host nation France."

The players entering are formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings will be determined based on the performances achieved in the previous 52 weeks of the qualifying window.

Hence, those ranked outside the top 56 and from NOCs with less than four entries are permitted to compete. A player could only participate if he or she is allowed and drafted to represent the player's country in Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup for three of the following years: 2022, 2023, and 2024. Four of the remaining eight slots are attributed to the NOCs who have not already qualified four tennis players across three continental zones (the winner and runner-up from the 2023 Pan American Games; the gold medalist each from the 2022 Asian Games and 2023 African Games). The final four spots are reserved, one for the host nation France, two for previous Olympic gold medalists or Grand Slam champions, and one for applicants for the Universality place.\nFor the men's and women's doubles, thirty-two places will offer for the highest-ranked teams with ten of them reserved for players in the top ten of the doubles rankings, who could select his or her partner from their NOC ranked in the top 300 of either singles or doubles. The remaining spots are attributed to the pairs with the highest combined ranking until the 32-team field is complete. If the total quota of 86 players in the relevant gender remains incomplete, additional places continue to be allotted through the combined ranking. Once the field completes, the remaining pairs with both players qualified in the singles are officially selected based on their highest combined ranking; otherwise, additional places are assigned to the pairs with one player qualified in singles, followed by the remaining pairs without any qualified player in the singles tournament, if necessary. One team per gender is reserved for the host nation France if none has already become eligible otherwise.\nWith no quota places available for the mixed doubles, all teams will consist of players already entered in either the singles or doubles, including the top 15 combined ranking teams and the host nation France."

        "text": "Jimmy Rogers (born 1988/1989) is an American football coach and former player who is currently the head coach for the South Dakota State Jackrabbits of the Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC). After playing college football for the Jackrabbits, he served as a graduate assistant with them for two years before joining Florida Atlantic in 2012. He returned to South Dakota State in 2013 as linebackers coach, later receiving a promotion to defensive coordinator in 2019, the position he served in until being named head coach in 2023. He closed his first season as Jackrabbit head coach by leading his team to the NCAA Division 1 FCS National Championship in Frisco, TX, January 7, 2024. \nEarly life and education.\nA native of Chandler, Arizona, Rogers attended Hamilton High School where he was a three-year letterman in football. He was the region defensive player of the year in 2004 and was named first-team all-state. He compiled 320 career tackles and also made 16 sacks and eight interceptions while helping the team win back-to-back state titles in his junior and senior years.\nRogers played college football for the South Dakota State Jackrabbits, enrolling in 2005 and spending his first year as a redshirt. As a redshirt-freshman in 2006, he appeared in all 11 games and posted 43 tackles, placing ninth on the team. In a game against UC Davis that season, he recorded 15 tackles, the highest for any South Dakota State player on the year.\nIn 2007, Rogers started all 11 games and posted 110 tackles, leading both the team and the conference and earning first-team All-Great West Football Conference (GWFC) honors. He was named second-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) as a junior in 2008 after starting all 12 games and recording 93 tackles. As a senior, Rogers was team captain and tallied 66 tackles, helping them reach the FCS playoffs. He finished his college career with 312 stops in 46 games played. He additionally forced three fumbles and intercepted three passes.\nCoaching career.\nRogers began a coaching career shortly after graduating from South Dakota State, serving as a graduate assistant from 2010 to 2011 at the school. He assisted the defensive backs in his first year before moving on to the linebackers in 2011, additionally assisting the special teams. In 2012, he became a graduate assistant for the Florida Atlantic Owls, working with the offensive line in his first year and spending early 2013 with the linebackers.\nRogers returned to South Dakota State for the 2013 season and served as linebackers coach. After serving in the position from 2013 through 2018, he was given the additional roles of co-defensive coordinator and assistant head coach in 2019, while remaining linebackers coach. By the start of the 2022 season, Rogers had coached at least one 100-tackle linebacker in all but one of his nine years in the position. He became the sole defensive coordinator for the 2022 season and helped the Jackrabbits defense lead the FCS in rushing defense and interceptions, while having the third-lowest points allowed. He was named the FCS Coordinator of the Year as South Dakota State went on to win the NCAA Division 1 FCS National Championship beating North Dakota State. John Stiegelmeier retired as SDSU's head coach following 26 seasons capped by the 2022 NCAA D-1 FCS National Championship and Rogers was named head coach of the Jackrabbits. Rogers was awarded the Eddie Robinson coach of the year in his first year as head coach for the Jackrabbits.\nPersonal life.\nRogers is married and has two children."

        "text": "Skeleton Psalms is the thirteenth studio album by Christian rock band Disciple. It is the band's first album in four years, and was produced by the band's guitarist, Josiah Prince, at his home studio The Ranch.\nBackground.\nOn January 13, 2023, the band released the first single for the album, \"The Executioner\", which marked the first new music the band had released since \"Love Letter Kill Shot\" back in 2019. On February 1, 2023, the album's second single, \"Promise to Live\", was released. The final single \"Bad Words\" was issued with the preorder for the album and tracklist.\nThemes.\n\"Every single song is intertwined and connected with each other,\" vocalist Kevin Young stated. \"They all deal with similar themes, they all have an element of being autobiographical. It's almost like chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3: human depravity, the unconditional love of God, then victory.\" \n\"The Executioner\" deals with \"coming to grips with your flaws, your failures, your shame, your sin. It's realizing that no, I don't want to celebrate anything about what I've done in this life. I want to lay my life down in exchange for a better one that God has for me.\" \n\"Promise to Live\" was derived from a sermon Young used to make. \"It's the idea that we all are in this world together, and are all in recovery together, from the trauma of this world and this life. We're not fighting alone. We're fighting together. We make this promise to God and to each other: to not give up. To not lose hope. To not give up fighting. To live for the most precious gift we have, which is life.\" \n\"Bad Words\" is concerned with Christians being told what to say and what not to say: \"We really like to write songs that make people excited about their faith, hopefully not make people annoying, abusive or violent Christians. More that they've set the constitution of their heart to where they are unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ: I am going to love you. I'm going to love you no matter your political party, or your race, or any other kind of adjective that separates you from someone else. For God so loved the world, and therefore I so love the world. But if you think it's a bad word for me to say Jesus? I just need you to know that I'm going to say what I believe, because of my love and my passion for Him and my love and my passion for people. That they need to know that there is a God. And He did not come to the world to condemn the world, but He came to the world to save them. That's our message: this bad word known as Jesus.\""

        "title": "Larry Kennedy (baseball)",
        "text": "Lawrence William Kennedy (May 1917 – March 4, 1995) was an American professional baseball player. A left-handed pitcher, he played two seasons in the minor leagues with the Mayfield Clothiers, Siloam Springs Travelers and Lincoln Links, and was known for going from living at Boys Town to playing professional baseball. He also twice served as the mayor of Boys Town, and was for a time their police commissioner as well as director of public safety.\nEarly life and time at Boys Town.\nKennedy was born in May 1917 in Des Moines, Iowa. Due to family circumstances, he went to live at Father Flanagan's Boys' Home in March 1929. There, he often played sports with the others boys, showing \"keen athletic ability.\" Although he participated in \"all forms of sport,\" he showed the most promise in baseball, where he played as a pitcher. With the Boys Town high school baseball team in 1936, Kennedy won 14 consecutive games, including three no-hitters. He batted and threw left-handed, and his pitching style was considered unusual as he relied on an overhand fastball, while most left-handed players threw sidearm curves. In the winter of 1936, Kennedy worked out in the gym between 30 minutes and one hour every day to improve his abilities. He was trained by Ken Corcoran, a brother of former National Football League (NFL) player Jack Corcoran.\nIn addition to his athletic ability, Kennedy was also a highly respected citizen of Boys Town and was twice elected mayor, in 1935 and 1937. He also served as police commissioner around this time, with his \"honesty, integrity, and fairness\" being a \"byword\" to the community, according to \"The St. Louis Star and Times\". He began his professional baseball career while he was still the mayor.\nProfessional career.\nNear the end of June 1937, Kennedy and Corcoran attended a baseball school held in Des Moines, sponsored by the St. Louis Browns of Major League Baseball (MLB). At the event, he \"fanned four of the eight batters he pitched against, wasted few balls, showed fine speed and a fairish hookball,\" according to \"The Home Journal\". Several Browns scouts were in attendance, and one commented \"He throws easy. He's got plenty of size (Kennedy was six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds). He ought to go some place with those powerful shoulders and good legs.\"\nAfterwards, Kennedy was sent two contracts by the Browns to sign. The contracts stated that he would attend training camp with Des Moines in the Western League, and if he was not retained by them, would go to a lower level team. He received much media coverage for going from Boys Town to professional baseball, and several articles compared him to Babe Ruth, one of the greatest players in the sport's history, who had also played as a left-handed pitcher and had been basically unknown prior to becoming a pro player.\nAfter the collapse of the Western League in 1938, Kennedy was sent to the Class B Springfield Browns instead of Des Moines. After spending the spring training period with them, he moved to the Class D Mayfield Clothiers of the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League (also known as the KITTY League). Kennedy saw little action as a pitcher in 12 games with the team, and afterwards was transferred to the Siloam Springs Travelers in the Arkansas–Missouri League so he would have more of an opportunity. He was referred to in a scene in the 1938 film \"Boys Town\", where one character says \"One of our guys plays in the St. Louis Browns' organization!\"\nAfter finishing his first year of professional baseball, Kennedy returned to Boys Town and began training every day in the gym for the 1939 season. In March 1939, he was given a trial by the Lincoln Links of the Western League. He made the team and played in seven games, pitching 41 innings and posting a 4–2 win–loss record with an earned run average of 4.02. After the season ended, Kennedy played in the Junior American Legion's \"Little World Series\" and caught the attention of Pittsburgh Pirates scouts, who promptly had him signed. He was assigned to the Class C Hutchinson Pirates, but suffered an injury to his arm which ended his professional career. Kennedy later played in local sandlots.\nLater life and death.\nKennedy worked as a secretary for the Boys Town welfare office from 1940 to 1941. He attempted to join the Army in 1941 to serve in World War II, but was declined due to having a high blood pressure. He subsequently accepted a clerical position with the FBI and assisted agents in South America. After the war, Kennedy was hired at Boys Town by Father Flanagan, who placed him in charge of the Boys Town Security Patrol and the souvenir shop. He was their first official police chief and also served as Director of Public Safety, retiring after being in these positions for 38 years.\nWith his wife, Pat, Kennedy had two daughters. He enjoyed coaching youth baseball teams and was a dedicated fan of the Omaha Royals, having his own reserved seat at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium. He often arrived at their games over an hour and a half early, and enjoyed watching the pregame practice as well as playing with children in attendance.\nKennedy died on March 4, 1995, at the age of 77. He was posthumously inducted into the Boys Town Alumni Sports Hall of Fame in 2008."

        "text": "The 2023 Iga Świątek tennis season officially began on 31 December 2022 as the start of the 2023 WTA Tour. Iga Świątek entered the season as the world number 1 player in singles for the first time in her career.\nSeason summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nŚwiątek started 2023 as only the fourth woman in WTA history to be ranked world No. 1 for 40 or more consecutive weeks in their first stint as the top-ranked player. In her first tournament of the year representing Poland at the United Cup in Brisbane, Świątek defeated Yulia Putintseva, Belinda Bencic and Martina Trevisan on the way to the semifinals where she lost to Jessica Pegula in straight sets. At the 2023 Australian Open, the top seeded Świątek reached the fourth round after winning against Jule Niemeier, Camila Osorio and Cristina Bucșa. In the fourth round she was defeated by reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in straight sets.\nMiddle East tournament and Sunshine Double.\nIn February 2023, Świątek successfully defended her title at the WTA 500 Qatar Ladies Open when she defeated Jessica Pegula in the final in straight sets. This was her first title of the year and the twelfth of her career. She did not drop a set throughout the tournament and only lost five games. At the Dubai Championships, she defeated Leylah Fernandez, 14th seed Liudmila Samsonova, Karolína Plíšková (by walkover) and fifth seed Coco Gauff, all matches in straight sets with only nine games lost, to reach the final. She lost to Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets, ending her six match winning streak.\nOn 13 March she reached her 50th consecutive week at world No. 1. At the Indian Wells Open she defeated Bianca Andreescu and Emma Raducanu in rounds three and four, both in straight sets. However, she lost once again to Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, preventing Świątek from defending her Indian Wells title. Due to a rib injury suffered during the Indian Wells event, Świątek withdrew from the 2023 Miami Open, which also prevented her from defending her Miami Open title.\nMid-year clay season.\nAt the Stuttgart Open in April, Świątek entered the tournament as the defending champion. She reached her third WTA final of the season by defeating Zheng Qinwen, Karolína Plíšková and Ons Jabeur (retired). In the final, she defeated world No. 2, Aryna Sabalenka, in straight sets in claiming her 13th career singles title. At the Madrid Open she reached the quarterfinals for the first time at this tournament defeating 16th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova. In the finals, she lost to Aryna Sabalenka in a rematch of the 2023 Stuttgart Open. \nIn May, Świątek entered the Italian Open as the defending champion. In the second round, she doubled-bageled Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova before defeating Lesia Tsurenko and Donna Vekić in the following rounds. In the quarterfinals, she faced Elena Rybakina and was forced to retire in the third set after sustaining a right thigh injury. At the French Open, Świątek reached her fourth major final without dropping a set. She won her third French Open and fourth major title overall, defeating Karolína Muchová in three sets in the final. She also became the first woman to defend the title since Justine Henin in 2007.\nGrass court season and home event.\nAt the Wimbledon, Świątek reached her first ever quarterfinal at the tournament after eliminating Zhu Lin, Sara Sorribes Tormo, Petra Martić and Belinda Bencic. In the quarterfinal, she lost to Elina Svitolina in three sets, which ended her 14-match win streak.\nIn July, Swiatek competed in the Poland Open and reached the final after achieving victories over Nigina Abduraimova, Claire Liu, Linda Nosková and Yanina Wickmayer. In the final, she defeated Laura Siegemund claiming her first WTA 250 title and 15th overall.\nUS Open series.\nIn preparation for the Canadian Open, Świątek was seen practicing with her mouth taped shut. She explained that this was a breathing exercise she did to improve endurance. She reached the semifinals at the event losing to Jessica Pegula, in three sets.\nAt the Cincinnati Open, Świątek defeated Danielle Collins, Zheng Qinwen, and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Markéta Vondroušová, before being upset for the first time by Coco Gauff in the semifinals.\nAt the US Open, Świątek began her title defense with convincing victories in the first three rounds. However, in the fourth round she was upset by 20th seed Jeļena Ostapenko, in three sets, and consequently ceded the world No. 1 ranking to Aryna Sabalenka, ending her 75-week streak in the top position. Świątek’s 75-week reign at No.1 is the third-longest streak among players in their first stint as the top player behind only Steffi Graf and Martina Hingis. On 25 September, Świątek began her 100th consecutive week in the top 10 of WTA ranking becoming the second Pole (after Agnieszka Radwańska) to achieve this milestone.\nClosing tournaments.\nShe reached her third WTA 1000 final and seventh overall for the season at the China Open, defeating third seed Coco Gauff ending her 16-match win streak. She won her fifth title of the season and 16th overall with a straight sets win over Liudmila Samsonova.\nShe won the 2023 WTA Finals defeating Jessica Pegula in straight sets in under an hour and returned to year-end World No. 1 for a second consecutive year. It was her 68th match win of the season. She became the first woman since Serena Williams in 2012 to win the title without dropping a set.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head match-ups.\n\"Ordered by percentage of wins\""

The tournament took place on March 19, 2023 at Estadio de Béisbol Charros de Jalisco in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, Mexico. The 2023 edition of the tournament featured three-person teams, referred to as \"trios\" in \"Lucha Libre\"; this differed from the previous edition of the event which featured traditional two-person tag teams. \nThe tournament showcased teams with wrestlers from numerous international promotions including Mexico's Nación Lucha Libre (NLL), America's All Elite Wrestling (AEW), Impact Wrestling (Impact), and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), Japan's Dragon Gate and Oz Academy (Oz), and Qatar Pro Wrestling (QPW). The men's tournament was won by Team Mexico (Taurus, Pentagón Jr., and Laredo Kid) and the women's tournament was won by Team United States (Deonna Purrazzo, Kamille, and Jordynne Grace).\nBackground.\nThe Mexican \"lucha libre\" promotion AAA, with the financial support of the Mexican brewing company \"Grupo Modelo\" organized the first ever Lucha Libre World Cup in the summer of 2015. The tournament itself was a one-night eight-team tournament for \"trios\", or tag teams of three wrestlers. AAA reached out to several promotions both in Mexico and around the world and arranged for six of the eight teams to come from outside AAA. Japanese wrestling promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah both sent teams. Both Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and Ring of Honor (ROH), based in the United States, also sent representatives to the tournament, in each case bolstered by representatives of Lucha Underground, an AAA joint-venture project based on Los Angeles. The tournament took place on May 25, 2015, and had the AAA labelled \"Dream Team\" of Rey Mysterio Jr., El Patrón Alberto and Myzteziz win the tournament, defeating Team TNA/Lucha Underground (Matt Hardy, Mr. Anderson and Johnny Mundo) in the finals. A second World Cup was held in the summer of 2016. The second edition featured two tournaments, one for male wrestlers and another for female wrestlers. The men's tournament was won by Brian Cage, Chavo Guerrero Jr., and Johnny Mundo of Team Lucha Underground while the women's tournament was won by Faby Apache, Lady Apache, and Mari Apache of Team Mexico.

The events are located in Norway, the Czech Republic, and Italy. The 2023 World Orienteering Championships in Switzerland are not included in the World Cup, but the European Orienteering Championships in Italy are part of the World Cup program. Non-European Orienteers can hence participate in the European Championships as well. Russian and Belarusian competitors are still banned, but this season saw Natalia Gemperle returning to the world cup, now competing for Switzerland.\nThe season started in Østfold, Norway, with a long distance race won by reigning champions Tove Alexandersson and Kasper Harlem Fosser. Fosser also won the middle distance but Alexandersson finished in second place, ten seconds behind teammate Sara Hagström. Both the relays were won by Swedish teams.\nWhen the season continued in Česká Lípa all individual women's races were won by Tove Alexandersson, giving her a 130 point lead ahead of Sara Hagström in the world cup. Almost securing her ninth total world cup win. On the men's side the races where won by Ralph Street, Jannis Bonek and Kasper Fosser. The relay was won by the Swiss team before the Czech and Swedish teams.\nThe World Cup Finals included the European Orienteering Championships and competitions were held in northern Italy. In the Sprint, Matthias Kyburz won with 4 seconds ahead of Kasper Fosser, putting Kyburz only 23 points behind Fosser in the World Cup standings heading into the Knock Out Sprint. In the Women's class, Hagström was the winner ahead of Alexandersson, but Alexandersson's 80 points for finishing second place was still enough to guarantee her the overall world cup victory with one round still to go, her score of 560 points now being impossible to reach for second placed Hagström even if Alexandersson did not finish and Hagström won the final round. By winning the overall world cup, Tove Alexandersson tied with Simone Niggli with 9 overall wins and one overall second place. \nIn the Knock Out Sprint, Alexandersson won the final round to end her season with 5 victories from 7 races. In the Men's class, a quarter final collision between current world cup leader Kasper Fosser and Swiss runner Joey Hadorn lead to both runners being unable to finish, leaving the World Cup open to Kyburz to overtake Fosser and win the World Cup if he finished in 4th place or better in his semi-final. In the end, Kyburz easily surpassed this, winning the Knock Out Sprint outright to take his 6th World Cup overall victory and his first since 2018.\nPoints distribution.\nThe 40 best runners in each event are awarded points.

Defending discipline champion Sofia Goggia of Italy fractured her ankle prior to the start of the season and missed five of the eight events, ending her chances to repeat. In addition, 2018 runner-up Lindsey Vonn of the USA, who had closed the prior season by winning all of the final four downhills and needed only four more victories to equal Ingemar Stenmark's all-time World Cup victory record, began the season injured and announced her planned retirement at the end of the season, but was hampered during her comeback by her cumulative injuries, and finally retired immediately after the conclusion of the 2019 World Ski Championships. \nAmong this wide=open field, Austrian skier Nicole Schmidhofer grabbed the lead in the discipline going into the next-to-last race of the season at Crans Montana in Switzerland, where a bizarre timing mishap occurred. In a race won by Goggia after her return, Schmidhofer was originally announced as placing third in the downhill, but before the podium, the placings were controversially changed and Schmidhofer was demoted to fourth behind Goggia and two Swiss skiers, Joana Hählen and Lara Gut-Behrami. However, three days later, the official standings were again changed as, after a review of the adjustments made due to a timer misplacement, it turned out that four Swiss skiers (including both Hählen and Gut-Behrami) had been given incorrect adjustments, and Schmidhofer was moved up to second, giving her a 90-point lead with one race to go, virtually clinching the discipline championship for the season. Schmidhofer then secured the title for 2019 at the season finals in Soldeu, Andorra when her nearest rival, fellow Austrian Ramona Siebenhofer, failed to win the race.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2019 World Ski Championships, which were held from 4–17 February in Åre, Sweden.

Current coaches are Mike Knezevich and Kevin Boyle. \nHistory.\nLacrosse in Croatia started in 2011 as a project of local fans of the sport who started with the first Lacrosse trainings in Zagreb with limited knowledge and equipment. Thanks to the help of coaches from North America, the sport began to grow in popularity in Croatia. At the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2015, with the help of American lacrosse enthusiasts, the plans to form the Croatian national lacrosse team began. First plan was to compete in 2016 European Lacrosse Championship, however due to financial constraints, the Croatian national lacrosse team competed in a smaller parallel tournament for freshly formed national teams instead.\nIn 2018, Croatian national lacrosse team competed in its first official international tournament, 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. In the tournament, Croatia scored its first win against Chinese Taipei in first play-in game of a lower bracket, after losing both games in group stages against New Zealand and Spain. After further loses against Hungary, Bermuda and China, victory against Turkey ensured the 43rd place in their first international tournament. The next international tournament appearance was supposed to happen at 2020 European Lacrosse Championship, however due to COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was postponed and eventually in 2022 replaced with European Lacrosse Qualifiers for the 2023 World Lacrosse Championship. In European Qualifiers, Croatian team started strong with a 7–5 victory against Hungary, however a crushing 1–9 defeat against Austria lowered the qualifying chances drastically. Croatian team defeated Slovenia 14–7 before ultimately losing to Switzerland 7–8 and Italy 7–12 to finish 4th in a group of 6 and missing out on qualifying to 2023 World Lacrosse Championship. In 2023, Croatian men's lacrosse team participated in Lacrosse Prague Cup, finishing 3rd."

        "text": "The 1934 America's Cup was the 15th challenge for the Cup. It took place in Newport and consisted of a series of races between the defender \"Rainbow\", entered by a syndicate of New York Yacht Club members headed by Harold S. Vanderbilt, and \"Endeavour\", owned by Sir Thomas Sopwith.\nBackground.\nThomas Sopwith had bought the challenger for the 1930 America's Cup, \"Shamrock V\", after the death of its owner, Sir Thomas Lipton. After sailing the yacht in the 1933 season, Sopwith decided to mount his own challenge for the Cup, and communicated this to the New York Yacht Club. The NYYC accepted the challenge, again to be a competition between J-class yachts, and with a new condition this time that the yachts carry quarters for their crews. In recent contests, the yachts had been practically empty shells, and in the 1930 race in particular, the winning boat, \"Enterprise\" had been criticised as a \"mechanical boat\" because her winches were carried below decks and the crew that worked them were similarly below decks and out of view. Installation of living quarters would bring the action back above deck. \nOther changes to the rules this year included:\nOnce again, the winner was to be the winner of the majority of seven races.\n\"Endeavour\" was towed across the Atlantic by Sopwith's motor yacht \"Vita\", arriving at Newport in late August. Sopwith had already arrived separately and had been given a tour of the defender, \"Rainbow\" by its skipper Harold S. Vanderbilt. This tour led to a protest by Sopwith that \"Rainbow\" had not followed the spirit of a new rule introduced to the competition that year that yachts should be fitted out with crew accommodations. Below decks, \"Rainbow\" was spartan, while \"Endeavour\" even carried a bathtub in the captain's cabin. The Cup Committee responded to the protest by allowing Sopwith to strip out large parts of \"Endeavour\"s interior prior to racing.\nCompetition.\nThe first race of the competition was attempted on Saturday, September 15, 15 miles to windward and return. Winds had been very light, and shortly after the yachts rounded the mark, they dropped away even further. The race was eventually abandoned because neither yacht could complete the course within the allowed time limit for the race. When the time limit expired, \"Rainbow\" was within a mile of the finish, and nearly a mile ahead of \"Endeavour\".\nAfter that, \"Endeavour\" won the first two races by a wide margin, and indeed won a course record on the second race, with Sopwith himself at the helm.\nIn the third race, \"Endeavour\" led the way until the final leg. Vanderbilt, skipper of \"Rainbow\" considered the race — and the Cup — lost, and handed the helm over to a member of his afterguard, Sherman Hoyt. Hoyt correctly anticipated how Sopwith would maneuver during this leg, and was able to lure his opponent into losing momentum and the race. \nThe fourth race proved very eventful and controversial. The two yachts nearly collided at the start line, yet neither signalled a protest. \"Endeavour\" went on to establish a lead early in the race, but a poor decision by her navigator allowed \"Rainbow\" to take it from her. Realizing what was happening, Sopwith maneuvered hard to try to force \"Rainbow\" to give way under the Racing Rules of Sailing. \"Rainbow\"s skipper, Vanderbilt, chose not to give way, risking a collision, and also risking disqualification from the race if Sopwith signalled a protest and the Committee upheld it. Sopwith chose to bear away and not risk a collision, but did not signal a protest. \"Rainbow\" finished the race more than a minute ahead of \"Endeavour\", but as \"Endeavour\" crossed the line and approached the Committee boat, Sopwith hoisted the protest flag. Controversy arose because according to the British rules with which Sopwith was familiar, protests were signalled at the end of the race. However, under American rules, the protest had to be signalled at the time of the incident. For his part, Vanderbilt argued that no collision was imminent and that the two yachts had not come within thirty metres of each other. \nAfter deliberation, the Committee awarded the race to \"Rainbow\", ruling that the near-collision at the start line had been \"Endeavour\"s fault, and if any disqualification was to happen, \"Endeavour\" should already have been disqualified long before the incident that Sopwith was protesting. This decision was still controversial in 2021, nearly 100 years later.\n\"Rainbow\" went on to win two more races and successfully defend the Cup.\nThe results of the four races were:"

Vanderbilt, and \"Endeavour II\", the second in Sir Thomas Sopwith's line of Cup challengers.\nIn 1935, Sir Richard Fairey issued a challenge to the New York Yacht Club for the America's Cup. In it, Fairey proposed that the race be held among K-class yachts, smaller than the J-class raced in the previous two competitions. The NYYC declined this challenge, preferring to keep the competition among the J-class.\nThe following year, Sir Thomas Sopwith, the challenger in the 1934 competition issued a new challenge of his own, for J-class yachts. The NYYC accepted this challenge, but since 1936 was an American presidential election year, they opted to hold the races in 1937.\nHarold S. Vanderbilt who had been central to the NYYC's previous two defenses, attempted to form a syndicate to fund a defense to Sopwith's challenge. However, the poor state of the American economy meant that he could not attract backers, and eventually funded the entire defense himself, investing $400,000 (around $8.5 million in 2022 dollars). His yacht, \"Ranger\" was designed by Olin Stephens and Stanley Burgess and built at the Bath Iron Works. \nSopwith commissioned \"Endeavour II\" from Charles Nicholson and brought her across the Atlantic with \"Endeavour\" to conduct tests with different combinations of sails and spars. \nBecause \"Ranger\" was the only candidate put forward to defend the Cup, there were no selection trials, but Vanderbilt practised racing the yacht against the J-class \"Yankee\" which had been an unsuccessful contender for the defense of the cup in 1930. \nAs in the previous two competitions, the winner was to be the best of seven races. The first three races were uneventful, and \"Ranger\" won them easily — the second race by over eighteen minutes. In the fourth race, Vanderbilt maneuvered towards the start buoy in a way that forced \"Endeavour II\" to pass the buoy before the starting gun fired. Because of this, \"Endeavour II\" had to circle the buoy and begin the race again, having lost 75 seconds in the maneuver. \"Ranger\" won this race by three minutes and successfully defended the Cup."

The dip in temperature allowed the team to return to a full schedule on the Stuart Rink for the first time in three years. Unfortunately, the lack of practice time over that stretch was still hampering the team and, after opening the season with a win, Army dropped eight contests in a row. Through that losing skin, the Cadets were barely competitive on most nights, however, as the season progressed the results slowly began to improve.\nTeam captain Normando Costello was lauded for his play in goal and was regarded as the team's best player for much of the season. Observers put most of the blame on the high numbers of goals against on the poor play of the team's skaters.\nBeing able to practice on Stuart Rink for most of the season allowed Marchand to coach his team into a decent unit. In the last four games of the year, Army was able to score at least three goals in each game, a far cry from the 13 total markers they had earned in the first nine matches.

        "text": "Robert Rowell is an American sports executive who worked for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 16 years. Rowell was team president from 2003 to 2011.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAfter completing his degree at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Robert Rowell worked for the university as business manager in the athletic department. In that role, he led an upgrade in the school's NCAA status from Division II to Division I-A.\nIn 1995, he was hired by the Golden State Warriors as assistant controller. He focused on marketing the team better, leading a re-branding campaign using the slogan: \"It's a Great Time Out.\" He also improved the Warriors' website, increasing the number of visits and sales there, as well as installing an in-arena cybercafé and experimenting with live webcasts. Game attendance and season ticket sales increased.\nRowell's successful marketing efforts led to increased responsibilities in the organization's front office, becoming chief operating officer in 2001, at 34 years old. He represented the team at the NBA Board of Governors and received Sports Business Journal's Forty Under 40 Award the same year.\nWarriors president.\nIn June 2003, Rowell was promoted to team president, reporting to Chris Cohan, owner of the team at that time. Rowell's tenure as president was marked with success from a business operations standpoint but mostly disappointment on the basketball side.\nAfter a disappointing finish to the 2003-04 season, head coach Eric Musselman was fired, and stars Nick Van Exel and Erick Dampier were traded. Rowell made his first major hires, attempting to better the team's basketball prospects. He hired Chris Mullin as executive vice president of basketball operations, similar to a general manager role, and Mike Montgomery as head coach.\nThe team underperformed under Montgomery, remaining at 12th place in the western conference for both years. However, flashes of potential came from the drafting of Monta Ellis and a trade for Baron Davis. In September of 2006, Don Nelson replaced Montgomery as head coach and the team returned to the playoffs and shocked many in the basketball world when they defeated the top seeded Dallas Mavericks.\nThe Warriors would not return to the playoffs under Rowell. Jason Richardson was traded in June 2007, Baron Davis left in free agency the following year. The decision to suspend Monta Ellis for 30 games for his moped accident created a rift between Rowell and Mullin in the team front office. This, as well as differences of opinion in player contract negotiations, led to Mullin's ouster in May 2009. Larry Riley became the new GM.\nIn July 2010, ownership of the team changed, with Cohan selling it to a group led by Joe Lacob and Peter Guber for a then-record price of $450 million. Rowell stayed for a year but was terminated as team president in 2011, as part of an organization-wide shake up under the new ownership group.\nPost-Warriors work.\nAfter Rowell left the Warriors, he went on to work for The Wagstaffe Group, a legal publishing company, as a partner. He also serves as an advisor to EPIC Leisure Management."

The Whalers ended the 1915 season with a record of 56–45, as John O'Brien served as manager, ending the season 1.0 game behind the first place Hartford Senators in a close race. In 1915, the Colonial League had essentially become the minor league feeder for the Federal League, a structure that was the downfall for the Colonial League. The Federal League was forced to fold following the 1915 season, leaving the Colonial League unable to continue following the conclusion of the season.\nIn the era, the \"Whalers\" nickname was shared by the semi-professional New Bedford Whalers soccer team, also based in the city. The team played as members of the Southern New England Soccer League from 1914 and 1918 and continued to play until 1932 in two other leagues. The team also played at Sargent Field, sharing it with the baseball team.\nNew England League 1929 &amp; 1933 / Northeastern League 1934.\nIn 1929, New Bedford returned to minor league play. The New Bedford \"Millmen\" returned to play as members the eight-team Class B level New England League. The New Bedford Whalers placed third in 1929 New England League standings, finishing 12.0 games behind the first place Lynn Red Sox. With a record of 62–51, the Whalers played the season under manager Jack Ryan. The Millmen folded after the 1929 season and did not play in the 1930 New England League.\nThe 1933 New Bedford \"Whalers\" returned to play and played their final New England League season, finishing in first place. New Bedford played under manager Freddie Maguire and finished the 1933 season with a record of 58–33, placing first in the New England League regular season standings. The Whalers ended the season 2.0 games ahead of the second place Worcester team. After having the league's best record, New Bedford refused to participate in a post season playoff. Second place Worcester and third place Winchester began a playoff that was cancelled due to weather with each team winning one game. Edward Baker of New Bedford won the New England League batting title, hitting .413.\nIn 1934, the Whalers played their final season in a new league, joining the eight-team Class B Northeastern League, which played only the 1934 season before permanently folding. The Cambridge Cantabs, Hartford Senators, Lowell Hustlers, Manchester Indians, Springfield Ponies, Waltham Rosebuds and Watertown Townies teams joined the Whalers in beginning league play.\nPlaying their final season, New Bedford placed fifth in the Northeastern League standings. Playing the season under manager Jean Dubuc, the Whalers ended the season with a record of 46-60, finishing 18.5 games behind the first place Worcester Rosebuds.\nAfter the Northeastern League folded after one season, New Bedford has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballparks.\nIn the 1895 to 1898 seasons, the New Bedford teams played home minor league games at the \"Olympic Field.\" The ballpark was located at Kempton Street &amp; Jenny Lind Street. Today, the site contains both commercial and residential properties.\nWhen the Whalers resumed minor league in 1903, New Bedford began play at \"Sargent Field\" and would continue to host home games at the ballpark until the minor league Whalers played their final season in 1934. The ballpark had a capacity of 3,500. The Sargent Field site was first named after William E. Sargent, who was a teacher and administrator at New Bedford High School, until his death in 1910, when he was serving as principal of the school. In 1990, the athletics field site was renamed to include school board member Dr. Paul F. Walsh. The ballpark site is still in use today, located adjacent to the school at 1121 Ashley Boulevard."

        "title": "Great Britain women's national baseball team",
        "text": "The Great Britain women's national baseball team is the national women's baseball team of the United Kingdom. It is governed by the British Baseball Federation, and is also a member nation of the Confederation of European Baseball.\nHistory of women's baseball in the United Kingdom.\nThe emergence of women's baseball in the London region.\nIn 1929 an exhibition baseball match took place between the women of the West End theatre production company of The Five O'Clock Girl at Stamford Bridge. In the early 1930s informal women's baseball teams such as Middlesex Ladies were being formed in the London region and playing occasional games in Wealdstone. By this time the Kodak research facility had been established at the Kodak Harrow site, and with ties internationally to Rochester, New York it appears more than coincidental that baseball was popular in the area. Initially formed in 1926, by 1931 the baseball section of the Kodak Recreation Society had three teams in a works based women's league.\nThe most successful of these teams was Hawkeye, who had won the previous two Kodak League Cups, played under ‘Canadian softball rules’. The Coach of the baseball players was Toronto native Eddie Lynch, who was so impressed with Hawkeye that he openly challenged all-comers to try and defeat his team, with the winner to be crowned winners of the ‘European Championship of Baseball’. The first club to accept the challenge were St Dyfrig's Girls Team, of Cardiff, who were defeated 10–8, with the Kodak Hawkeye team made up predominantly of factory typists, and thus claimed the title of European Champions of Baseball.\nBritish Celanese were another manufacturing company who encouraged baseball among its female workers via works teams, Kodak's Hawkeye team defeated them twice prior to the European Championship challenge had been laid down by Lynch. The Kodak works baseball teams were still going strong as late as 1935. In 1936 two women's clubs were formed at Hackney, by the founder of the Hackney Royals, Fred Whitehead, and to be coached by Royals Coach Irving ‘Snooker’ Ruvinsky. Ruvinsky, a catcher originally from Montreal, was part of the Great Britain roster that won the 1938 Baseball World Cup. Whitehead proposed that the players would be female staff from the Hackney greyhounds and local female speedway fans. In 1937 the Kodak girls were invited to challenge West Ham girls, prior to a senior men's West Ham game, in an effort to promote the women's game, and the Kodak team were described as \"pioneers of ladies baseball\".\nThe rise and fall of organised women's baseball in Yorkshire.\nIn April 1936 Alfred T. Grogan, honorary Secretary Treasurer of the newly formed Yorkshire County Baseball Association, was bombared by requests from women in the region for the establishment of a women's team, which would be the first of its kind in the North of England. It was not long before Leeds Pioneers and Greenfield Amazons (Bradford) were formed and preparing to play against each other. That August the first ever women's baseball game played in Leeds took place at Elland Road and in Bradford, at Greenfield Stadium. Grogan reportedly received an invitation for these West Yorkshire clubs to form a representative England team to tour Australia.\nBy October 1936 two women's clubs had also appeared in Kingston upon Hull and Grogan turned his attention to the establishment of a formal women's league, these two teams were given coaching by Elliott Lydiatt. It was noted that 40% of spectators at men's baseball games in Hull were women, which was a primary driver for Grogan to develop women's organised baseball in the area. Six women's teams were formed, including works sides of Reckitt and Sons and Needler's.\nA formal league was finally established for the 1937 season, with the support of Chet Adams, who was the newly appointed Manager of the men's Hull Baseball Club. At a meeting at Christ Church, Hull, attended by representatives from Reckitts along with Lydiatt, Grogan and Rev H. J. Munday, Chairman of Hull Amateur Baseball League. It was agreed that Lydiatt, a well known pitcher and member of the National Baseball Association, would organise good coaching for the women. Grogan stated that teams were being formed in Leeds and other parts of Yorkshire, along with Hull, and that it was expected that a Yorkshire representative side would be selected to challenge a London representative side at West Ham Stadium.\nIn May 1937 members of Castleford Urban Council formed a women's team to play against Castleford Tigers, another local woman's team. The women were starting to create an impression in the press, in June 1937 Irene Lockwood of Leeds Pioneers was described in the Daily Mirror as \"the Babe Ruth of Leeds\", following their 19–9 victory over Castleford Tigers. Young girls were also being inspired by the baseball playing ladies, Castleford Tigers chose four-year old Greta Scott as their mascot.\nBy this stage Hull had established a league with six women's teams, Castleford had two teams, Bradford had two teams, Leeds had one, and Eddie Gladu was coaching the women of Sheffield, and the establishment of an inter-city league was a genuine prospect. In fact baseball had really caught the imagination of the women of Yorkshire, Hull Nomads were so inundated with applications to play for them that they were forced to create two additional teams alongside their senior side and Craven Park, Hull was often used for games. The 1937 season saw teams from across the Hull area join the league, including Young Women's Christian Association, Co-Op Ladies, Hull Pioneer White Caps and Boulevesco.\nIn January 1938 Mr R. E. Lewis, Secretary of newly formed the Coventry Thursday Baseball League, asked for women interested in forming women's teams to contact him. He erroneously believed this league would be the first women's baseball league in the country. In truth, the league in Hull was the only women's league in the United Kingdom. By the 1938 season the women's section of the Hull Amateur League was expanded to two divisions of six teams, with Hull G. Girls and Alexandra Laundry joining the league. Teams were also competing for the Yorkshire Ladies Baseball Cup and the Infirmary Cup. During this golden age Hull Nomads were dominant, much to the joy of their president, the Sheriff of Hull, Wallace Rockett, such was the impact of the league that the American Consul in Hull, Ilo Clare Funk, donated a silver trophy for the league winners.\nThe 1939 season had eight teams competing, including Alexandra Nationals and Hammonds Royals The impact of World War II began to negatively affect the league, it was expected that in the 1940 season some clubs would play friendlies rather than join the league and that teams would be created from local defence units. Indeed, on the eve of the 1940 season only four teams had joined the league Across this era Hull Nomads won the league championship, Ladies Baseball Cup and the Infirmary Cup multiple times. The Nomads had incredibly won the league every year, since its inception in 1937 and had even defeated the men's team, Beetonsville Diamonds.\nWartime decline.\nAs war took hold on life in the United Kingdom there were opportunities for the baseball playing ladies to use their experience against the military. Hull Nomads competed against a men's team for the second time, in an exhibition game versus Hull Air Cadets. The exploits of North American service personnel playing baseball in wartime United Kingdom have been documented, but few are aware that the people of Birmingham were lucky enough to witness the women of \"Six Triple Eight\" playing baseball in their city. In 1945 the Birmingham Mail described how locals would often enjoy watching the ladies from the all black 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion enjoying playing baseball, during their down time. In the Aldershot area, Canadian women serving in the United Kingdom established the Canadian Women's Baseball League.\nAt the conclusion of hostilities there was an effort to revive women's baseball in the United Kingdom, especially in the former hotbed of Hull. In 1948 preparations got underway to revive the league, but this never came to fruition. In 1949 it was announced that some women were already in training and that a women's section of the Hull Baseball League was to be formed, but again it proved futile. Whilst men's domestic baseball shrunk after the war, women's all but vanished.\nNational team formation and controversy.\nBaseball in the United Kingdom has a long history, and a well established men's senior representative side, but it was not until 2020 that a women's side was established by the British Baseball Federation. Amanda ‘Doris’ Hocking, who had spearheaded the formation of Women's Baseball UK, the body that created the first women's domestic league in the United Kingdom for 80 years, was appointed as the first General Manager.\nHowever, in April 2021 Hocking resigned in protest over a tweet made by the British Baseball Federation's Twitter account, which was widely perceived to have sexualised women in baseball. Amongst those who supported Hocking for her stance was men's senior team Manager, Drew Spencer. The President of the British Baseball Federation, Gerry Perez, was forced to resign, after a week of defending the tweet and refusing to remove it.\nFirst international tournament.\nIn preparation for their international debut at the Women's European Baseball Championship Sheffield Bruins women's team Head Coach, Josh Taylor, was appointed as Pitching Coach and Fiona Brambley was appointed as team Trainer, to travel out to France with the squad. The team's debut international championship got off to an explosive start, with the women piling on the runs in a commanding victory over the Czech Republic, on the first day of the competition. Laura Hirai scored six runs in the game. Dora Lau and Gabriella Sassoli both crossed the plate four times. Sassoli also collected four RBI. During the tournament catcher Marianna Casal placed emphasis on the importance of the team making its international debut, hoping to inspire other girls and women to take up baseball in the United Kingdom, by leading her team in the European Championship. She said \"Even if we do come back in fourth, we will have been the first women in Great Britain to go a baseball Euros. That is an achievement, we are making history.\"\nNotable figures.\nAlthough she never played domestically in the United Kingdom, nor represented Great Britain, it is important to note the legacy of Elizabeth Stride, known professionally as Lizzie Arlington. Stride was born to English parents in the United States, in 1877, and was the first woman to play for a professional men's team.\nLaura Hirai was the first ever batter for the senior women's team, scoring the first run. Hirai was also the first ever Ball Girl in New York Yankees history, at the 2019 MLB London Series. Hirai is the first woman to represent both the Great Britain Baseball Youth National teams (U16 and U18) and the Great Britain Baseball Women's Senior National Team, and also play for the Great Britain Softball Women's Senior National team.\nTournament records.\nWorld Cup.\nGreat Britain have yet to qualify for the Women's Baseball World Cup, the most recent tournament was scheduled to take place in Monterrey, Mexico in 2020 but was postponed until 2021 then cancelled due to covid. The finals of the next tournament are scheduled to take place in 2024, in Thunder Bay, Canada.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\nGreat Britain were not formed in time to compete at the 2019 2019 Women's European Baseball Championship, in Rouen, France, and were therefore not eligible to qualify for the 2020 Women's Baseball World Cup.\nThe 2022 Women's European Baseball Championship was held on Wednesday, 3 August to Saturday, 6 August 2022 in Montpellier in France, with France as defending champions. Once again the championships also served as qualifying event for the next Baseball World Cup. Great Britain, in their first ever international tournament, finished 4th and therefore did not qualify for the Baseball World Cup.\nCurrent roster.\nThe team's most recent roster, for the 2022 Women's European Baseball Championship."

        "text": "The men's downhill in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of ten events, including the final. The season had been planned with fourteen downhills, but early in the season, two scheduled downhills on 29/30 October 2022 on the Matterhorn, running from Switzerland (Zermatt) into Italy (Cervinia), were canceled due to lack of snow and not rescheduled. Later in the season, a downhill scheduled for Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 28 January 2023 was also cancelled for lack of snow and not rescheduled. Finally, on 3 March, a scheduled downhill at Aspen was canceled due to poor visibility and deteriorating weather conditions, even though 24 racers had already started. The first out of the starting gate, Norway's Adrian Smiseth Sejersted, held the lead and was hoping for six more competitors to start so that the race would become official, but the weather conditions prevented that.\nAfter eight events, defending champion Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway had won five times, and held more than a 150-point lead over three-time winner Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria. The remaining downhills will take place in March 2023, by which time four-time former discipline champion Beat Feuz of Switzerland will have retired, joining longtime star Matthias Mayer of Austria with an in-season retirement, even though both were currently in the top 10 in the discipline. After another cancelation, Kilde won the downhill in Aspen, thus clinching the season championship prior to the finals.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (since 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The men's downhill was held on 12 February at Courchevel on the L'Éclipse course.\nThe season final took place on 15 March at Soldeu, Andorra. Eligible to partake were the top 25 in the downhill standings, others who have at least 500 points in the overall standings, and the downhill gold medalist at the Junior World Championships. With the reduced field, only the top 15 earned points."

The season was originally planned with eight races, but two were cancelled early in the season and were not planned to be rescheduled. However, when two races planned at Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 28-29 January 2023 were cancelled due to a lack of snow, the two previously-cancelled Super-G races were rescheduled on those dates at Cortina d'Ampezzo, restoring the original Super-G schedule plan. \nAfter four events, both defending champion Aleksander Aamodt Kilde and last year's runner-up Marco Odermatt had won two races each and finished second once, but Odermatt led the standings by 28 points due to the fourth result (third versus eighth). Odermatt then won the fifth race (with Kilde second) to add to his lead, and after he won the sixth race as well, his discipline lead was up to 148 points over Kilde. Odermatt then won the next-to-last Super-G of the season in Aspen to close out Kilde, who finished third, and clinch the discipline championship for the season.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (since 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The men's super-G was held in Courchevel on 9 February.\nThe World Cup discipline final took place on 16 March 2023 in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 in the Super-G discipline ranking and the winner of the Junior World Championship were eligible to compete in the final, except that all skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the overall classification may participate in all disciplines (but none did in Super-G). Only the top 15 finishers in each discipline scored points."

        "text": "In January and February 1983, a representative team of West Indian cricket players undertook a so-called \"Rebel tour\" to South Africa, to play a series of matches against the South African team. At the time, the International Cricket Council (ICC) had placed a moratorium on international cricket teams making tours of South Africa, due to the nation's government policy of apartheid, leaving South Africa with no official international competition.\nBackground.\nThe West Indian players were mainly talented understudies struggling to break into the great West Indian Test team of the period, or men past their prime as Test players. First-class cricketers in the West Indies were then poorly paid and the participants, many of whom had irregular or no employment in the off-season, received between US$100,000 and US$125,000 for the two tours. West Indies cricket was so strong that Clive Lloyd had little need for the likes of Lawrence Rowe, Collis King and Sylvester Clarke. Rowe has since stated that he and several other players were disillusioned with the West Indies Cricket Board for not selecting them despite good performances.\nThe previous season a Sri Lankan team toured South Africa which was theorised to have helped pave the way for players from the West Indies to tour by demonstrating it possible for a non-white cricket team to tour South Africa safely.\nThe strength of Caribbean cricket was evidenced in the 'international' matches, where South Africa received their first real test. A fiercely contested four-week series in 1982–3 took 'unofficial internationals' to new heights, the Springboks winning the one-day series 4–2 while the 'Test' series was drawn 1–1. The dominant theme of the match-ups was West Indian fast bowling. Colin Croft was one of four World Cup winners in the party. Their pace battery, featuring Clarke, Croft, Stephenson, Bernard Julien and Ezra Moseley, the Springbok batsmen wore helmets for the first time. The frantic first series, organised in secret and conducted on the hoof, set up a fierce battle when the West Indians returned for a full tour the following season.\nAftermath.\nThe West Indian players were given life bans in all forms of the game, depriving West Indian cricket of a large amount of player talent. Despite earning much money from the tour many West Indian players faced social stigma and unemployment afterwards with nine leaving the Caribbean altogether as a result. Though the ban was lifted in 1989 only one of the players, Ezra Moseley, was selected to play for the West Indies post 1989."

Unlike the previous edition, the continental championships will be counted as part of the three-star events, with the national meets excluded from the qualification strata.

Athletes will be selected by name at the end of the period, respecting the three-member quota limit for each NOC, gender, and event, until the list is complete.

        "title": "Seattle Golf Club",
        "text": "The Seattle Golf Club (SGC; until November 2, 1912 Seattle Golf and Country Club or SCC) occupies about in Shoreline, Washington, immediately north of Seattle. Although accounts disagree, Lou Gellos's history of the club confidently states that the 18-hole golf course was originally designed by Minneapolis-based Scottish golf course designer John Ball. It was most recently redesigned in 1996 by Arnold Palmer. The golf course and clubhouse (built in 1908, designed by Cutter &amp; Malmgren) were developed in conjunction with The Highlands, an adjacent residential development. The club had purchased , and the portion not used for the course was divided into fifty parcels of land, all of which were initially sold to members of the club; those fifty parcels constitute The Highlands. Membership can be obtained only by invitation \"through the sponsorship of Active members.\"\nWhile the club always has been, and remains, specifically a men's club, many women also play the course. In the early years, about twenty wives of members played; they paid dues under a status of Lady Golfers. In 1975, longstanding practice was formalized and any wife of a member was welcome to join as a Lady Golfer without a separate process of application. A women's locker facility was added when the clubhouse was remodeled in the 1980s.\nHistory.\nAt the time the club was founded in 1900, Seattle's only golf course was a 5-hole course with a tent clubhouse near present-day Gas Works Park. The Seattle Golf Club was incorporated August 8, 1900 with the intention to build a proper course. From the outset, it was an elite organization. The initial US$50 initiation fee and US$30 annual dues were among the highest in western North America at the time. The club's initial president was judge Thomas Burke. Other founders included Seattle fire chief (later state senator) Josiah Collins; former Seattle corporation counsel George Donworth; Manson F. Backus (banker, philanthropist, book and art collector); Ira Nadeau, who would later serve as director general of the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition,; banker Jacob Furth; Pierre P. Ferry, whose home later became the official residence of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Olympia; former Seattle mayor John Leary; businessman Horace Chapin Henry, whose art collection became the basis for the Henry Art Gallery; and a number of Seattle's other leading attorneys and businessmen.\nOn September 5, 1900 the Board approved a 10-year lease on a property in what is now the Laurelhurst neighborhood sufficient for a 9-hole course. In the initial years, the course doubled as pasture for landlord David Ferguson's cows and goats. At some unknown date in the next several years the club purchased the land outright. The course was designed by a Scot, John Ball, who lived in Minneapolis, with assistance from another Scot, Willie Watson, who designed several golf courses in the Pacific Northwest. A farmhouse was converted to a clubhouse; that building was later moved about a block and is still extant as a residence at 5100 NE Latimer Place.\nAt that time the area was known as \"Yesler\" (after Seattle pioneer Henry Yesler) and was outside city limits and rather remote. To reach it from Seattle, golfers took the Madison Street Cable Car to the end of the line on Lake Washington, the took a naptha-powered launch called the \"Sunny Jim\" to a landing near the present-day Shoreline Street End 127, where 51st Ave NE hits the west shore of Lake Washington. (The \"Sunny Jim\" was operated strictly for the golf club, and riders had to give a password to board.) Golfers then needed to climb up a ravine to the clubhouse. (There was an alternative land route, that required a long walk from the Floyd station of the Seattle-Everett Interurban.)\nThe six holes closest to the clubhouse (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9) were completed by the time the course opened on September 6, 1901, and three more were added later. However, the club decided to move. Accounts of the reasons for this vary. Lou Gellos dismisses the claims that the space at Laurelhurst was inadequate. Thirty members of the club, organized as the Seaboard Security Company, owned a large, mostly logged-off, tract of land on the Puget Sound shore north of the city, about four miles north of Ballard. They proposed to buy the club's Yesler/Laurelhurst property for US$100,000. The rest of the transaction is a bit foggy: money from the Meadows racetrack (on the site of present-day Boeing Field) may have been involved. In any case, the club used US$40,555 of this same money to purchase the tract up north. Another US$44,000 was set aside for a clubhouse, and dues were significantly increased.\nOn March 21, 1907, after deciding to purchase the at their current location, the Board approved the sale of the Laurelhurst property, and agreed to lease back that property while building their new facility. That location was purchased April 4, 1907, and work began once again with course designer John Ball and with Spokane-based clubhouse architects Cutter &amp; Malmgren. The Laurelhurst lease ended June 30, 1908 and official play at the new location began June 12, 1909.\nIn that era, transportation to the new site in present-day Shoreline was a problem as well. This was an issue both for construction and for golfers to reach the course. For construction purposes, it appears that Joshua Green's Puget Sound Navigation Company brought materials to the nearby Puget Sound shore; these were then hauled up by an \"overhead tram\" powered by a donkey engine.\nAs for the golfers, although the property could be reached by dirt and plank roads that went to Richmond Beach, most people, even most wealthy people, didn't own automobiles, or considered the primitive road inadequate. It took an hour to drive the 11 miles from Downtown Seattle. That was solved when Stone &amp; Webster agreed to build an east-west branch line off of their Seattle-Everett Interurban line to serve the new location with an electric shuttle car. By 1918, members either lived in the nearby Highlands or arrived almost entirely by automobile, and the shuttle was discontinued, as eventually was the Interurban.\nDespite a 1912 fire and various alterations and renovations, the Cutter &amp; Malmgren clubhouse remained essentially the same until the mid-1980s, but it was not always well-maintained. By 1987, it was \"literally coming apart.\" A renovation in 1987-1988 cost nearly $US3 million, and was essentially a rebuild except for the exterior walls: they gutted the interior, rebuilt the basement shear wall, and rearranged the interior design so that an elevator could be added. Chimneys were rebuilt, steel beams were added, and for the first time the building joined the irrigation system in being connected to the city water supply rather than its own well.\nThe course.\nThe Seattle Golf Club course is somewhat unusual for an American golf course in that virtually no private homes (or, really, any man-made structures other than the clubhouse) are visible from any part of the course. The club is also somewhat unusual for being strictly a golf club: no tennis courts, no swimming pool, not even a billiards table.\nUntil 1920, only the greens were watered; the greens were hand-mowed, but the fairways were meadows, left to nature. As gasoline-powered mowers became available, the fairways began to be watered and mowed as well, and golf became more of a spring and summer game, less of a fall and winter game. Some time in the 1920s, a city water supply connection was obtained to water the course via wooden irrigation pipes, which were replaced by cast iron in 1931, and were in turn replaced again circa 1960 as the course switched over to a built-in sprinkler system.\nDue in part to problems caused by maple trees planted in the course's early years, the course underwent a significant remodeling in 1968-1969. Under a design by Ted Robinson, all of the greens and most of the tee boxes were reworked. Two holes (the 8th and 12th) were completely redesigned. The project required closing the whole course for the duration, took longer than expected to be completed, and resulted in several club members resigning in anger, while others pitched in and assisted by walking the courses and picking up rocks that had surfaced during the construction. The remodel was completed May 19, 1969. The new course was \"christened\" by a foursome of some of the club's oldest members, including the 98-year-old Joshua Green.\nA further renovation in the early 1990s by Arnold Palmer went much more smoothly. Palmer was initially brought in because there was a general consensus that the 18th hole didn't allow for enough strategic choices. Palmer redesigned that hole to make it a more reasonable gamble to try to start off with a long drive in an effort to birdie. He also ended up completely redesigning the 8th hole, and re-engineering several bodies of water He also improved the practice area and convinced the club to remove about 300 trees, including one that had stood in the middle of the 3rd-hole fairway and had made it almost impossible to approach the hole in anything like a conventional manner. The renovation also lengthened the course by some .\nPlayers and tournaments.\nU.S. President William Howard Taft, an avid golfer, played both the Laurelhurst course when he visited Seattle in 1907, and the current course when he visited as president in 1909 for the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\nAmong the tournaments held at the current course have been the 1952 U.S. Amateur, the 1961 Walker Cup, and the 1981 U.S. Senior Men’s Amateur."

        "title": "Francis Lopez (basketball)",
        "text": "Francis Leo S. \"Lebron\" Lopez (born May 17, 2003) is a Filipino-Angolan college basketball player for the UP Fighting Maroons of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). After breaking out in the Philippine high school basketball scene, he was set to play in the Overtime Elite (OTE) league, but due to visa issues, never got to play there. Instead, he committed to play for UP.\nHigh school career.\nLopez first played varsity basketball for Augustinian Abbey School (AAS) at 13 years old. He also continued growing in height, from 5'3\" when he 10 years old, to 6'3\" at 13 years of age. He then gained significant attention after starring for Las Piñas in the 2018 edition of NCR Palaro, an annual sporting competition for youth from all over Metro Manila, where they just missed the medal rounds.\nLa Salle Green Hills.\nLSGH assistant coach and scout Anton Brodett recruited Lopez to play for La Salle Green Hills (LSGH) after seeing him play in a neighborhood basketball court in Las Piñas. However, he averaged 2.3 points and 1.3 rebounds in 3.4 minutes, seeing action in only 10 of their 22 games in all. He was also set to play in the NCAA Season 94 Shooting Stars competition, but didn't get to compete and was replaced by Sebastian Locsin. LSGH went on to finish as runner-ups to Mapúa for Season 94.\nAteneo de Manila.\nAfter Season 94, LSGH underwent changes in management. That, and talks with Ateneo assistant coach Ford Arao, prompted Lopez to transfer to Ateneo de Manila.\nLopez debuted in Season 82 with 14 points and seven rebounds in a win over the Adamson Baby Falcons. In their first loss of the season, which was against the FEU Baby Tamaraws, he had 18 points, 14 boards, and five blocks. Ateneo bounced back with a win over the UPIS Junior Maroons, in which he had 20 points and three blocks. He then had a double-double of 17 points and 18 rebounds over the UST Tiger Cubs. At the end of the first round of eliminations, he was fifth in the MVP race as Ateneo had a record of 4–3. Against the NSNU Bullpups, he had 17 points, nine rebounds, and five blocks, but missed a go-ahead dunk that eventually led to a close loss. At the end of eliminations, he was third in the MVP race as Ateneo went on to clinch the 3rd seed. However, they lost in the first round of the playoffs to Adamson. He was awarded a spot on the UAAP Juniors Mythical Team at the end of the season, and finished with averages of 16.0 points on 45% shooting, 9.2 rebounds and 3.0 blocks.\nIn 2020, Lopez made it to the NBTC 24, a list of the top high school basketball players in the country. He was named among the 2020 SLAM Philippines Rising Stars. Two years later, he got to play in the SLAM Rising Stars Classic.\nLopez did not graduate from Ateneo, opting to pursue a professional basketball career.\nFailed stint with Overtime Elite.\nOn July 13, 2021, Lopez opted to leave Ateneo and signed with the Overtime Elite basketball league. However, he never got to join the league, as his visa was constantly rejected by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). He only received $25,000 of his $100,000 deal but it was supposedly only for the use of his image and likeness in the promotional materials of OTE. He then spent time with the Philippines' men's national team and attempted to play for the Illawarra Hawks in the NBL, but due to his Filipino-Angolan heritage, did not qualify as an Asian import.\nCollege career.\nUP Fighting Maroons.\nFor the next phase of his basketball career, it was expected that Lopez would either play overseas or play for the Ateneo Blue Eagles. On January 21, 2023, on the night Ateneo was celebrating its Season 85 basketball championship with a bonfire, it was reported that Lopez had committed to playing for the UP Fighting Maroons. Aside from his family and friends, he also credited UP star player and Gilas teammate Carl Tamayo for helping him in his decision. His former agency also released a letter saying that since he didn't attain a US visa, his contract with them is considered void ab initio (void from start), clarifying eligibility concerns. On September 27, 2023, the UAAP board officially cleared him to play for UP. \nLopez made his debut in Season 86 in a win over the Adamson Soaring Falcons, in which he only scored five points, but grabbed 13 rebounds. In a win over the NU Bulldogs, he scored 14 points, seven rebounds, four assists, two steals, and a block. In a 31-point win over the UST Growling Tigers, he had 11 points and four assists. Against Ateneo, he tweaked his ankle. He was able to play the following game, and had 11 points and seven rebounds in a rematch against Adamson. In a win over the FEU Tamaraws, he had a near double-double with 12 points, nine rebounds, and four assists. The Maroons got the first seed that season. In the Final Four, UP beat Ateneo, making a return to the finals. In Game 1 of the finals against the DLSU Green Archers, he led the team with 15 points and 11 rebounds to a 30-point win. He played in that game despite having low sugar, and had to wear an armband that monitored his sugar levels. For Game 2, he dealt with flu, and had to take in IV fluids and meds before the game. La Salle extended the series and beat UP in Game 3 to win the championship. He won the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the sixth Maroon to win the award after Eric Altamirano (1983), Woody Co (2006), Kyles Lao (2013), Juan Gómez de Liaño (2017), and Carl Tamayo (2021).\nNational team career.\nJunior national team.\nIn 2019, Lopez was named to the Gilas U-19 team for the 2019 FIBA Under-16 Asian Championship.\nSenior national team.\nIn 2021, Lopez made his senior national team debut against Indonesia in the third window of the 2022 Fiba Asia Cup qualifiers. He contributed eight points and five rebounds in just nine minutes as Gilas beat Indonesia. That year, he was the final cut of the team before Gilas competed in the Olympic Qualifying Tournament.\nIn 2022, Lopez joined Gilas Pilipinas for that year's Southeast Asian Games. On his 19th birthday, he had 17 points, five rebounds, two blocks, and a plus-minus rating of 23 in a win over Cambodia. He followed it up with 18 points on 7-for-7 in a win over Malaysia. They were on the verge of sweeping the tournament until they lost to Indonesia in the finals, settling for a silver medal. Later that year, he played in both the 2023 FIBA World Cup qualifiers and the FIBA Asia Cup.\nPersonal life.\nLopez is Filipino-Angolan. He got his nickname \"LeBron\" from his family and friends, as he was the tallest in their neighborhood. He also looks up to NBA superstar LeBron James."

Simmons in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nWhen Lehigh opened their season, they had agreed to participate in a 3-game tournament in Clinton, New York. Unfortunately, as most of the team were new additions who had only 4 practices to get used to one another, the Engineers performed rather poorly. After getting stomped by the hosts 3–17, the squad was throttled by Middlebury 0–22, setting numerous program records on both sides. While the results of the final match with Union were comparatively much better, the Dutchmen were very weak competition.\nAs if to drive the point home about just how much ground the Engineers had to make up, a further game with Hamilton shortly thereafter ended 0–15. In fact, Lehigh would be shutout in five consecutive games, an NCAA record (since broken), and would not score again until their meeting with Georgetown on February 14. After a further pair of lopsided losses, the Engineers played probably their best game of the season when they took on the Harrison Maple Leafs. While their comeback ultimately fell short, it was the closest the team came to a victory all year and showed that the offense did have some fight in them.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Silver Anniversary Hamilton Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Eastern Illinois' record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

        "text": "Mathew Hicks (born ) is an American former professional basketball player. He played part of the 1973–74 NCAA Division I men's basketball season for the DePaul Blue Demons men's basketball before being discovered to be academically ineligible. He immediately transferred from DePaul University to Northern Illinois University to join Northern Illinois Huskies men's basketball. At Northern Illinois, he was a two-time All-Mid-American Conference first-team selection and 1977 Mid-American Conference Player of the Year. He had played for West Aurora High School in Aurora, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, before college.\nHigh school.\nMatthew Hicks barely made his school's 8th grade \"B\" basketball team. When he was a high school junior, he only scored 72 points for the varsity team. As a senior, in 1973 he tallied 718 points. In 2007, the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" dubbed the 1973 game between West Aurora and East Aurora High School, as the best athletic contest in school history. Although Hicks contributed 20 points, the final margin in the 50–48 contest was a tipin by teammate Craig Hardy. In an early-round Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class AA playoff game, Hicks had a storied face off against Ernie Kent of Rockford West High School, in which he outscored the foul-plagued Kent 29–17 as part of a 60–52 victory. In the 1973 IHSA Class AA state championship tournament, Hicks, who went by the nickname Skip at that time, went 5–16 (3–12 in the second half) in scoring 13 points in the semifinal 39–33 upset loss to New Trier High School. Hicks rebounded in the consolation game with 30 points to defeat Lockport Central High School 67–45 for third place, the highest finish for West Aurora since the 2nd place 1959 team. Hicks finished with a tournament high 87-point four-game total. He made the All-Tournament team along with future NBA All-Star Rickey Green, Alvin Green, future MLB Rookie of the Year John Castino, and Bob Bone.\nDePaul.\nAs a freshman for , Hicks started some early-season games. Described as a \"great leaper\" with an wingspan, Hicks' first start was on December 8, 1973, when DePaul visited Northwestern at McGaw Hall. Hicks averaged 11.8 points and 8.9 rebounds in DePaul's first 10 games. \nHicks' high school grades were below the 2.0 GPA meaning that he should have been ineligible to play as a freshman, but he was on the roster due to an oversight by head coach Ray Meyer. Even though he had a B− average during his first quarter at DePaul, when another Chicago area school reported that he should have been ineligible, the National Collegiate Athletic Association investigated and ruled him ineligible. As of January 5, 1974, Hicks was still a highly regarded performer for the DePaul team and had just made an early season All-Tournament team. However, he was sidelined pending a meeting to consider his eligibility before DePaul's January 6 game against .\nNorthern Illinois.\nOn January 16, 1974, Hicks enrolled at Northern Illinois University (NIU). In his January 14, 1975, debut for Northern Illinois, he contributed 13 points off the bench including 2 overtime baskets in the 87–86 victory over Weber State. At Northern Illinois, he was a two-time All-Mid-American Conference first-team selection as a junior and as a senior in 1976 and 1977 earning Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year honors in 1977. He led the conference in scoring (25.0 and 25.3) and rebounding (12.8 and 13.0) as both a junior and a senior. He was an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press (1976, 1977), \"Sporting News\" (1976, 1977), and Converse (1977). \nAfter his 2.5 season career at NIU, Hicks left the school as its all-time leader in career points (1,513) scored, single-season points scored (682), single-MAC conference game points (42, March 7, 1977), single-MAC conference game rebounds (23, March 3, 1976) and career double-doubles (50). The single-MAC conference game rebounds record was still listed as the current record in the 2019–20 school record book. Paul Dawkins eclipsed some of Hicks' records including career points in 1979. He was named MAC player of the week twice as a junior (January 28 and March 2, 1976) and three times as a senior (Jan 2, Feb 1 and 8, 1977).\nHicks was not listed on the 1977 Pizza Hut All-American game ballot, but an organized write-in campaign in which his 950 dormitory mates cast 65,000 write in ballots got him selected. The Northern Illinois sports information director Bud Nangle and Rochelle, Illinois, Pizza Hut owner organized the effort to get him voted into the top 8 positions in the voting. The ballot box stuffing also pushed Chicago ballers Green and Bo Ellis into 2nd and 3rd place in the ballot. Hicks finished 7th. He lost the halftime slam dunk contest to Marques Johnson.\nPersonal life.\nHicks' younger siblings and his son Theo played high school basketball for West Aurora. His younger brother, Ron, played basketball at George Williams College."

For the second straight time, Paris 2024 will witness both men and women fence against each other in the individual and team events held in all three weapons (foil, épée, and sabre).\nQualification.\n212 fencing quota places, with an equal distribution between men and women, are available for Paris 2024, similar to the Tokyo 2020 roster size. Qualified NOCs can enter a maximum of eighteen fencers (nine per gender), with each consisting of a trio, whether men's or women's, across all weapon-based team events (foil, épée, and sabre). \nAbout two-thirds of the total quota will be attributed to the world's top fencers based on the points accrued in the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) Official Ranking between April 3, 2023 and April 1, 2024, with further individual places available at each of the four zonal qualifying tournaments (Africa, Asia &amp; Oceania, Europe, and the Americas). \nThe team events will offer eight to nine spots for all registered NOCs competing in each weapon. Each team must be composed of three fencers (or a fencing trio). The top four teams in each weapon will qualify directly for the Games, with the next set of places assigned to the highest-ranked nation from each of the continental zones (Africa, Asia &amp; Oceania, Europe, and the Americas) between fifth and sixteenth position. If a zone does not field any teams within the specific ranking (from fifth to sixteenth place), the top-ranked team eligible for qualification will secure a spot irrespective of the continent.\nFor the individual events, quota places vary from a minimum of 34 to a maximum of 37. With the team members directly entered into their respective individual competitions, six more places will be awarded to the eligible fencers based on the FIE Adjusted Official Ranking list by the continental zone of April 1, 2024: the top two fencers each from Europe and Asia &amp; Oceania; and the highest-ranked fencer each from the Americas and Africa. The zonal qualifying tournaments will offer four available spots with one each to the NOCs without a qualified fencer, male or female, in one or more weapons by the two previous pathways.\nHost nation France reserves six quota places to be distributed between the team and individual events, respecting the eighteen-member NOC limit and the 37-fencer limit for each weapon-based individual event. Two further spots are entitled to the eligible NOCs interested to have their fencers compete in Paris 2024 under the Universality rules.\nOlga Kharlan qualification in sabre fencing.\nSince July 1, 2020 (and reconfirmed by FIE public notice in September 2020 and in January 2021), by public written notice the FIE had replaced its previous handshake requirement with a \"salute\" by the opposing fencers, and written in its public notice that handshakes were \"suspended until further notice.\" Nevertheless, in July 2023 when Ukrainian four-time world fencing individual sabre champion Olga Kharlan was disqualified at the World Fencing Championships by the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime for not shaking the hand of her defeated Russian opponent, though Kharlan instead offered a tapping of blades in acknowledgement, Bach stepped in the next day. As President of the IOC, he sent a letter to Kharlan in which he expressed empathy for her, and wrote that in light of the situation she was being guaranteed a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympics. He wrote further: \"as a fellow fencer, it is impossible for me to imagine how you feel at this moment. The war against your country, the suffering of the people in Ukraine, the uncertainty around your participation at the Fencing World Championships ... and then the events which unfolded yesterday - all this is a roller coaster of emotions and feelings. It is admirable how you are managing this incredibly difficult situation, and I would like to express my full support to you. Rest assured that the IOC will continue to stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and the Olympic community of Ukraine.\""

The top four teams in each weapon will qualify directly for the Games, with the next set of places assigned to the highest-ranked nation from each of the continental zones (Africa, Asia &amp; Oceania, Europe, and the Americas) between fifth and sixteenth position. If a zone does not field any teams within the specific ranking (from fifth to sixteenth place), the top-ranked team eligible for qualification will secure a spot irrespective of the continent.\nFor the individual events, quota places vary from a minimum of 34 to a maximum of 37. With the team members directly entered into their respective individual competitions, six more places will be awarded to the eligible fencers based on the FIE Adjusted Official Ranking list by the continental zone of April 1, 2024: the top two fencers each from Europe and Asia &amp; Oceania; and the highest-ranked fencer each from the Americas and Africa. The zonal qualifying tournaments will offer four available spots with one each to the NOCs without a qualified fencer, male or female, in one or more weapons by the two previous pathways.\nHost nation France reserves six fencing spots to be distributed between the team and individual events apart from the qualified fencers through the pathways mentioned above, respecting the maximum quota of athletes per NOC (three per weapon). If the French fencers qualified directly for the team event, they can use two quota places if the NOC contains a single qualified fencer in a corresponding individual event; or three if none of them compete in a corresponding individual event. Two further spots, along with those unused by the host country, will be attributed to the eligible NOCs interested to have their fencers compete in Paris under the Universality rules, respecting the 37-fencer limit for each weapon-based individual event.\nControversy.\nOlga Kharlan qualification in women's sabre.\nSince July 1, 2020 (and reconfirmed by FIE public notice in September 2020 and in January 2021), by public written notice the FIE had replaced its previous handshake requirement with a \"salute\" by the opposing fencers, and written in its public notice that handshakes were \"suspended until further notice.\" Nevertheless, in July 2023 when Ukrainian four-time world fencing individual sabre champion Olga Kharlan was disqualified at the World Fencing Championships by the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime for not shaking the hand of her defeated Russian opponent, though Kharlan instead offered a tapping of blades in acknowledgement, Bach stepped in the next day. As President of the IOC, he sent a letter to Kharlan in which he expressed empathy for her, and wrote that in light of the situation she was being guaranteed a spot in the 2024 Summer Olympics. He wrote further: \"as a fellow fencer, it is impossible for me to imagine how you feel at this moment. The war against your country, the suffering of the people in Ukraine, the uncertainty around your participation at the Fencing World Championships ... and then the events which unfolded yesterday - all this is a roller coaster of emotions and feelings. It is admirable how you are managing this incredibly difficult situation, and I would like to express my full support to you. Rest assured that the IOC will continue to stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian athletes and the Olympic community of Ukraine.\""

The Raiders, led by seventh-year head coach Scott Nagy, played their home games at the Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio as members of the Horizon League.\nSeason summary.\nFor Wright State, 2022-23 began under the shadow of having lost its two leading scorers not to graduation or injury, but to the new open transfer rules. Grant Basile left for the Virginia Tech Hokies and Tanner Holden for The Ohio State Buckeyes. This fueled the concerns of supporters who worry about Wright State’s ability to compete in the NIL era. Veteran CJ Wilbourn was also unavailable much of the season due to injury.\nIt was a frustratingly mediocre season. After winning 20 or more games for the last six non-shortened seasons, they finished 10-10 in the Horizon league and only 18-15 overall. The losses and many of the victories were marked by turnovers and defensive breakdowns. Like most Scott Nagy teams, the Raiders were one of the top-scoring teams in the nation averaging nearly 80 points per game with a 49.6% field goal percentage.\nNew red-shirt freshman Brandon Noel was able to make up some of the loss in the front-court, winning Horizon League Freshman of the Year honors while displaying a surprising level of athleticism. However, like many freshman his scoring and defense proved inconsistent game to game, in particular against veteran opponents who could match him physically.\nTrey Calvin led the team with outstanding play at point guard, serving both as court general and the most consistent offensive weapon. He finished the season first team all Horizon League. Sophomores Alex Huibregtse and Andrew Welage showed good improvement as the season went on, hinting at better things to come.\nPrevious season.\nThe Raiders finished the 2021–22 season 22–14, 15–7 in Horizon League play to finish in fourth place. As the No. 4 seed, they defeated Oakland, Cleveland State, and Northern Kentucky to win the Horizon League tournament. They received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 16 seed in the South Region, where they defeated Bryant in the First Four, before losing in the first round to Arizona.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Horizon League tournament\nSources"

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Hawkeyes represent the University of Iowa in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference.\nIowa began competing in intercollegiate women's basketball in 1974, before the NCAA governed women's sports; in that era, the main governing body for women's college sports was the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW). The NCAA began governing women's sports in the 1981–82 school year; after one year in which both the NCAA and AIAW held national championship events, the AIAW folded. Because of Iowa's relatively recent history in women's basketball, there is no \"pre-modern\" era of limited statistics; full box scores are available for all Iowa games, and the only rules change that seriously impacted statistical totals was the advent of the three-pointer, which was made mandatory in NCAA women's basketball in the 1987–88 season.\nThe NCAA has recorded individual scoring and rebounding totals since it began sponsoring women's sports championships. However, it did not officially record the other statistics included in this page until later. Assists were first officially recorded in women's basketball in the 1985–86 season. Blocks and steals were first officially recorded in 1987–88, the same season in which the use of the three-pointer was made mandatory. Iowa only includes three-point statistics since the national adoption of that rule, but otherwise includes statistics from the entire history of Iowa women's basketball.\nThese lists are updated through the end of the 2023–24 season. Players and their performances from the 2023–24 season are indicated in bold. Iowa's record books list only the record-holder in single-game statistics (including ties for the top spot) and not a full top 10."

        "title": "New Zealand Women's Ice Hockey League",
        "text": "The New Zealand Women's Ice Hockey League (NZWIHL) is New Zealand's top-tier women's ice hockey league. Established in 2014 as New Zealand's first women's national league, the NZWIHL has amateur status and is sanctioned by the New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation (a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation). The NZWIHL is currently contested by four teams from both the North and South Islands. The league champion is awarded the Championship Trophy and gold medals and the league premier is awarded the Premiership Trophy. The most successful team in NZWIHL history is Auckland Steel, who have claimed four championship titles. The current champion, from 2022, is the Wakatipu Wild, who claimed their first title.\nHistory.\nThe New Zealand Women's Ice Hockey League (NZWIHL) was established in 2014 as New Zealand's top level women's national league. The newly formed league was setup to support the National Women's team, the Ice Fernz, for their IIHF World Championship seasons. The league would provide opportunity for female players of all ages to develop their skills and play together in a competitive environment. The league was founded with three teams, including: Auckland Steel, Canterbury Devilettes and Southern Storm.\nThe Auckland Steel topped the league standings in the first season to claim the first league premiership before they won the inaugural 2014 NZWIHL season grand final, to become the league's first championship team. The NZWIHL remained a three team league between 2014 and 2019, with Auckland establishing itself as a dominant force in the league, with four championship titles during this time. Canterbury were crowned champions in the second NZWIHL season and Southern Storm won the 2018 season. In 2020, a league decision saw the disbanding of the combined Southern Storm team and the establishment of two separate teams for the NZWIHL. The Dunedin Thunder and Wakatipu Wild were formed and based in Dunedin and Queenstown in the Otago region respectively. They joined the league and first competed in the 2020 NZWIHL season. Before the 2021 season, in July 2021, the Canterbury Devilettes changed their name to the Canterbury Inferno to create a separate identity from the Red Devils men's team. In August 2021, the league had to be cancelled midway through the season due to the New Zealand Government lock-downs to help minimise the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally the league still hoped to play finals at a later date, but that too got cancelled in November 2021. In 2022, Wakatipu Wild was the first of the two new teams to claim a league premiership and championship, when it went almost undefeated for the regular season and then won both games in finals.\nTeams.\nAuckland Steel.\nThe Auckland Steel ice hockey organisation was established in 2014. They are one of three founding teams of the NZWIHL, along with the Canterbury Devilettes (now known as the Inferno) and Southern Storm. The Steel are based at Paradice Avondale, located at in the western Auckland suburb of Avondale. Auckland are four times NZWIHL champions and one time NZWIHL premiers.\nGerman coach, Andreas Kaisser, known as Andy, was appointed inaugural head coach of the Auckland Steel ahead of the foundation season of the NZWIHL in 2014. He was joined by Canadian pair Garret Ferguson and Jonathan Albright as his assistants. Philippa Kaisser was appointed the Steel's first general manager (GM). On 29 November 2014, Auckland contested the very first NZWIHL game against the Southern Storm in Auckland. Forward, Hannah Shields, scored the Steel's and the League's inaugural goal after five minutes in the first period to give the home team the lead. Southern tied the game five minutes later but Auckland Steel controlled the game after that and went on to score their maiden win, defeating the Storm 11–4. The Steel turned that good first result into solid form for the remainder of 2014, winning ten of twelve games. This form propelled them to the top of the league standings and the maiden NZWIHL Championship title.\nAuckland established itself as a powerhouse in the NZWIHL, finishing top the table and winning four Championships in the first six years of the competition, including titles in 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. In 2020, the league brought in a playoff format (Finals). The Steel finished the season on top of the league standings once more, to claim the first ever NZWIHL Premiership title. Auckland went on to lose the first NZWIHL Grand Final to Canterbury Inferno 4–2, claiming silver medals at the post-game medal and trophy ceremony. The 2021 season was incomplete and abandoned following travel restrictions imposed by the New Zealand Government during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the NZWIHL returned to a full season. The Steel finished third in the regular season standings before claiming bronze medals in the NZWIHL Finals. They won their bronze-medal play-off against Dunedin Thunder 5–4, in a tightly contested game.\nCanterbury Inferno.\nThe Canterbury Inferno was established in 2014 as the Canterbury Devilettes. They are one of three original teams of the NZWIHL, along with the Auckland Steel and Southern Storm. he Inferno are based at Alpine Ice Centre, located at in the Christchurch inner-city suburb of Opawa. Canterbury are two time NZWIHL champions.\nThe team's original name, the Devilettes, was a derivative of the already well-established men's team Canterbury Red Devils. who have competed in the New Zealand Ice Hockey League since 2005.\nFormer New Zealand international player with the Ice Fernz, Angelique Mawson, was appointed inaugural head coach of Canterbury prior to the 2014 NZWIHL season. On 6 December 20214, Canterbury contested their opening NZWIHL game against the Southern Storm in Dunedin. Shannen Kennedy scored the Devilettes first ever NZWIHL goal in the second period against the Storm. After a close game for the first two periods, Canterbury out performed the Storm in the third period to defeats the hosts 8–2 and secure the team's maiden win. The Devilettes finished their first season last in the regular season standings, two points behind the Storm above them. Canterbury performed better in the second NZWIHL season, finishing the season with the same points as Auckland at the top of the league table. The Devilettes claimed their first championship title on goal difference, with their free-scoring forwards proving the difference to the Auckland Steel. Canterbury had five of the top six scoring leaders for the season, including Marisa Blanco, who topped the leaders chart with 38 points from ten games. In 2020, Canterbury claimed their second NZWIHL championship title with a 4–2 come-from-behind grand final victory over Auckland. It was the first ever NZWIHL grand final, since the league introduced a Finals series ahead of the 2020 season. In July 2021, following the team's second league title, the Canterbury Devilettes changed their name to the Canterbury Inferno to create a separate identity from the Red Devils men's team. In 2022, the Inferno made it to their second NZWIHL grand final. However, unlike in 2020, they were defeated by Queenstown based Wakatipu Wild 2–0 in the grand final, held at Dunedin Ice Stadium.\nSeason structure and rules.\nRegular season.\nThe NZWIHL regular season is typically played over three months, with dates varying from season to season. The regular season consists of twelve games in total, with each team playing six games. The regular season is broken up into two rounds with a round-robin format used. An overtime period (OT) and shootout (SO) are used to ensure there is always a winner when time permits during the regular season. In the unlikely event of there being no time for OT or SO, then a draw will be declared.\nGame length.\nThe NZWIHL has adopted the international standard three 20-minute stop-time periods length for all regular season and finals games. All games progress to overtime and then a shootout in case teams are tied at the end of regulation time. In order to allow appropriate time for overtime to occur, rinks are booked to hours as a minimum requirement in the NZWIHL.\nGame rules and points system.\nAll games and NZWIHL events are to be played in accordance to the rules set out in the NZWIHL events manual, followed by the International Ice Hockey Federation Rule Book. Governance for the events manual falls to the NZWIHL executive, headed by the General Manager (GM), and oversighted by the New Zealand Ice Hockey Federation (NZIHF) Management Committee. The NZWIHL points system, follows similar systems widely used in Europe and Australian ice hockey leagues. 3 points is awarded for a regulation time win, 2 points for a shootout win, 1 point for a shootout loss and 0 points for a regulation time loss. In the unlikely event of a draw, both teams will be awarded 1 point each.\nRoster &amp; import rules.\nThere are no maximum roster limits in the NZWIHL. Players must be 13 years or older to play in the NZWIHL. NZWIHL players are broken up into two categories, regional players (New Zealand or Australian citizens) and import players (a citizen of any other country). Import players must have a cleared international transfer card (ITC) in order to be eligible to play an NZWIHL game. There are no limits on the number of import players allowed on a team's roster, however there is a limit on the number of import players teams are allowed to dress for a game. As of 2022, five import players from each team (10 total) are allowed to dress for any one game. Players from the Wellington region are provided additional travel supports by the league to play in the NZWIHL, given they do not have a representative team of their own in the league. The NZWIHL covers the travelling costs of travelling teams up to 15 skaters, two goaltenders and three staff (20 in total). Any additional travelling players or staff need to be financial covered by the teams themselves.\nPlayoffs.\nPlayoffs are known in the NZWIHL as the Finals. They are played over a single weekend in a chosen location. The NZWIHL executive chooses the finals location. As of 2022, the Finals weekend involves four games in total, two semi-finals played on the Saturday followed by a third-place playoff and grand final on the Sunday. The top four teams from the regular season qualify for the finals weekend. The top seed plays the fourth seed in the first semi final followed by two verses three in the second semi. The two teams who win the semi-finals games progress to the grand final and the two teams who lose progress to the bronze medal game. The winner of the grand final is named NZWIHL champion and lifts the championship trophy. Gold, silver and bronze medals are given to rostered players and team officials on the teams who finish first, second and third in finals.\nLeague champions.\nNZWIHL champions by seasons (2014-present).\nReferences: \nBroadcasting.\nCurrent:"

        "text": "The boxing competitions at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are scheduled to run from 27 July to 10 August. Preliminary boxing matches will occur at Arena Paris Nord in Villepinte, with the medal rounds (semifinals and finals) staged at the iconic Roland Garros Stadium. \nThe boxing program for Paris 2024 will feature the same amount of weight categories as those in the previous three editions, consisting of thirteen in total (seven for men and six for women). Pursuant to the International Olympic Committee's mission of attaining full gender equality, the program continues to remain updated with the number of men's weight classes reduced by one contrary to the women's side by an increase of one weight category. \nIn June 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) barred the International Boxing Association's (IBA) rights to run and organize the tournament due to \"continuing irregularity issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, refereeing, and judging\". Hence, the IOC executive board established and ratified a new qualification system for Paris 2024 that would witness the boxers obtain the quota spots through the continental multisport events, such as Asian Games, European Games, Pan American Games, African Games, and the Pacific Games.\nCompetition format.\nPursuant to the IOC's mission of attaining full gender equality, Paris 2024 will institute another significant change to the boxing program, with the number of weight categories for men reduced from eight to seven, ultimately removing the light heavyweight division. On the other hand, the women's weight classes witness a corresponding rise from five to six with the bantamweight category introduced.\nThe male boxers will contest matches in these seven weight classes:\nThe female boxers will contest matches in these six weight classes:\nQualification.\nA total of 248 quota places, with an equal distribution between men and women, are available for eligible boxers to compete in Paris 2024, almost forty fewer overall than those in Tokyo 2020. Qualified NOCs could only send one boxer in each weight category. The host nation France reserves a maximum of six quota places to be equally distributed between men and women in their respective weight categories, while nine places (four for men and five for women) will be entitled to eligible NOCs interested to have their boxers compete in Paris 2024 as abided by the Universality principle.\nThe qualification period commences in five regional multisport events (African Games, Asian Games, European Games, Pacific Games, and the Pan American Games), set to be served as continental qualifying meets, where a total of 139 spots will be assigned to a specific number of highest-ranked boxers in each weight category. Following the continental phase, the remainder of the total quota will be decided in two world qualification tournaments organized by the IOC in the initial half of the 2024 season, offering another batch of spots available to the highest-ranked eligible boxers in each weight division."

Each NOC could only send a single boxer in each of the thirteen weight categories (seven for men and six for women).\nIn June 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) barred the International Boxing Association's (IBA) rights to run and organize the tournament due to \"continuing irregularity issues in the areas of finance, governance, ethics, refereeing, and judging\". Hence, the IOC executive board established and ratified a new qualification system for Paris 2024 that would witness the boxers obtain the quota spots through the continental multisport events, reducing the complexity of the process.\nThe qualification period commences at five regional multisport events in the middle of the 2023 season (African Qualification Tournament in Dakar, Senegal; Asian Games in Hangzhou, China; European Games in Kraków, Poland; Pacific Games in Honiara, Solomon Islands; and the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile), set to be served as continental qualifying meets, where a total of 139 spots will be assigned to a specific number of highest-ranked boxers in each weight category. Following the continental phase, the remainder of the total quota will be decided in two world qualification tournaments organized by the IOC in the initial half of the 2024 season, offering another batch of spots available to the highest-ranked eligible boxers in each weight division.\nThe host nation France reserves a maximum of six quota places to be equally distributed between men and women in their respective weight categories, while nine places (four for men and five for women) will be entitled to eligible NOCs interested to have their boxers compete in Paris 2024 as abided by the Universality principle. Because France obtained a total of seven quota places (three male and four female) at the 2023 European Games, the unused host places would thereby be redistributed to the next highest-ranked boxers in their respective weight divisions at the second World Qualification Tournament.\nMen's events.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's quota table\"/&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Men's quota table\"/&gt;\nWomen's events.\n&lt;section begin=\"Women's quota table\"/&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Women's quota table\"/&gt;"

        "text": "Douglas Gene Fisher (March 10, 1947 – February 12, 2023) was an American professional football player who was a linebacker for two seasons in the National Football League (NFL) for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football at Reedley JC and San Diego State and was selected by the Steelers in the 12th round (290th overall) of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft.\nEarly life and education.\nFisher was born on March 10, 1947, in Fresno, California. He attended Monroe Junior High School and later Caruthers High School, at which he was one of the top track and field players in the state, specializing in the discus throw and shot put. He set a divisional record in discus and tied one in shot put. Fisher also played football for the school, and is their only attendee to ever play in the National Football League (NFL). Standing at and weighing , he was described in newspapers as a \"mountain of muscle\" and was nicknamed \"Locomotive.\"\nAfter graduating from Caruthers, Fisher began attending Reedley Junior College in 1965. He played for their track and field and football teams, and played both fullback on offense and guard on defense. In a game near the end of the 1965 season, Fisher scored two touchdowns and helped Reedley win the CCJCAA championship. He received the team's Most Outstanding Lineman award for the year and was an all-conference selection.\nIn his first season with the Reedley track team, Fisher broke the school record for discus throw with a toss measuring and was awarded the team's trophy. He placed second at that season's state junior college championship tournament. The following year, he won the state discus championship over Joe Keshmiri and posted a throw that was the best in the nation among junior colleges. Fisher also was ranked in one list as one of the top 20 track and field participants in the US, and top 10 in college.\nFisher was scouted by San Diego State University, and upon graduating from Reedley JC, was offered a full scholarship by the school. He continued playing track and football there, although he changed his position to linebacker in the latter. He received praise from coach Don Coryell, who said that Fisher could be a great professional player. As a senior in 1968, he was named first-team All-Coast by United Press International (UPI). Fisher graduated with a double degree in marketing and sociology.\nProfessional career.\nFisher was selected in the 12th round (290th overall) of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was waived at the start of September and afterwards was brought back as a member of the taxi squad. He was activated near the end of October after the team released John Campbell, and was put back on the taxi squad in late November after Jerry Hillebrand was activated. Fisher was activated once further in , for the season finale against the New Orleans Saints.

        "text": "The 2023 Singapore Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix 2023) was a Formula One motor race held on 17 September 2023 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore. It was the fifteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship. \nThe race began with 19 drivers, following Lance Stroll's crash at the end of Q1, which triggered a red flag. It was won by Carlos Sainz Jr. for the second victory of his Formula One career. Sainz took pole position and led the entire race, finishing ahead of Lando Norris and Lewis Hamilton. For most of the race George Russell was looking at a podium but crashed out on the last lap at turn 10. The Grand Prix was the only race of the 2023 season that was not won by a Red Bull Racing driver; it also ended Max Verstappen's record streak of ten consecutive wins and Red Bull Racing's record streak of fifteen consecutive wins. AlphaTauri driver Liam Lawson scored his first points in Formula One by finishing ninth in the race.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 15–17 September. It was the fifteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship and the 22nd running of the Singapore Grand Prix.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nComing into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 145 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Fernando Alonso third, a further 49 points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Mercedes by 310 points and Ferrari by a further 45 points.\nCurrent World Constructors' Championship leader Red Bull Racing had an opportunity to secure their sixth title, their second in a row. Red Bull Racing would win the title if they claimed a 1–2 result with a bonus point for the fastest lap (44 points), with second-placed Mercedes scoring one point or fewer. If Red Bull Racing had achieved a 1–2 without the fastest lap (43 points), with Mercedes failing to score, their advantage would have been the same as the number of the obtainable points remaining in the season (353), but Mercedes would not have been able to win on a tie breaker due to Red Bull Racing achieving more wins than Mercedes.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were initially the same as the season entry list, with the exception of Liam Lawson, who was in the seat originally held by Nyck de Vries. Lance Stroll withdrew before the race following a crash in qualifying.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4 and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nTrack changes.\nTurns 16 through 19 of the previous layout were removed to facilitate the construction of NS Square, which is replacing The Float @ Marina Bay where the track previously went through. They were replaced by a new straight leading from turn 15 to the new turn 16, which was designated as turn 20 in the previous layout.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held for the event. The first practice session was held on 15 September 2023, at 17:30 local time (UTC+8). Charles Leclerc topped the session, with his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. recording the second-fastest time and Max Verstappen recording the third-fastest.\nThe second practice session was held on 15 September 2023, at 21:00 local time (UTC+8). Carlos Sainz Jr. topped the session, with his teammate Charles Leclerc recording the second-fastest time and George Russell recording the third-fastest. Alexander Albon reported engine issues during the session, and he was forced to sit out for the rest of the practice. The third practice session was held on 16 September 2023, at 17:00 local time (UTC+8). Carlos Sainz Jr. topped the session, with George Russell recording the second-fastest time and Lando Norris recording the third-fastest.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on 16 September 2023, at 21:00 local time (UTC+8).\nQualifying report.\nThe first session saw Yuki Tsunoda record the fastest time ahead of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg after a heavy crash for Lance Stroll brought out the red flag in the closing moments, taking himself, Valtteri Bottas, Oscar Piastri, Logan Sargeant and Zhou Guanyu out of qualifying. The second session was delayed due to debris on the final corner where Stroll had crashed. Following the session, Stroll was taken to the circuit medical centre and was deemed fit to race, but withdrew from the event.\nThe second segment saw Carlos Sainz Jr. top the session ahead of George Russell and Fernando Alonso. Pierre Gasly, Alexander Albon and Tsunoda were all knocked out of the session, but most notably, the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and his teammate Pérez were both knocked out in this session. Liam Lawson beat Verstappen to the line and into Q3 – Lawson's first – by a gap of 0.007 seconds. This is Red Bull Racing's first double Q2 exit since the 2018 Russian Grand Prix.\nThe third segment saw Sainz take pole position ahead of Russell and Charles Leclerc, his and Ferrari's second consecutive after the preceding Italian Grand Prix.\nFollowing qualifying, Max Verstappen and Logan Sargeant were given reprimands for various impeding incidents. Prior to the following Japanese Grand Prix the FIA stated that not giving either of the drivers grid penalties for their offences had been a mistake.\nRace.\nThe race was held on 17 September 2023, at 20:00 local time (UTC+8).\nRace report.\nZhou Guanyu started the race from the pit lane due to power unit changes. As the race began, Carlos Sainz Jr. kept the lead while teammate Charles Leclerc, starting on the soft tires, jumped ahead of George Russell to take second place. Meanwhile, Russell's teammate Lewis Hamilton took the turn 1 run-off and was noted by the stewards for gaining an advantage, so he gave the position back to Russell.\nHaving made contact with Sergio Pérez, Yuki Tsunoda suffered a puncture early in the race and retired on lap one due to damage to his sidepods. He safely parked his car behind the barriers. His retirement triggered a yellow flag for a brief time period. Not long afterward, Logan Sargeant crashed into a barrier and broke his front wing. He returned to the pit lane while his car spewed debris onto the track, triggering a safety car. Red Bull Racing chose not to pit their drivers during the safety car period, meaning both were running older hard tyres at the restart. Russell, Lando Norris, and Hamilton were thus able to pass Pérez and Max Verstappen, who were both struggling due to their older tyres. After dropping track position, Verstappen and Pérez came into the pits, coming out in fifteenth and eighteenth respectively, but recovered to fifth and eighth respectively. The race resumed with Sainz holding his pace at the front. A few laps later, Esteban Ocon stopped on track with a gearbox issue, triggering a virtual safety car. Mercedes took advantage of this to double-stack their drivers in the pits for new medium tires. Fernando Alonso, who had received a penalty during the earlier safety car period due to crossing the pit entry line, had a slow stop, leaving him last. Russell and Hamilton both passed Leclerc to claim third and fourth respectively.\nAs the race entered its closing stages, Sainz strategically allowed Norris, running in second place, to remain in range for DRS. The DRS benefit made it harder for Russell and Hamilton (third and fourth) to overtake Norris and challenge Sainz for the lead. On the final lap, Russell clipped the wall and broke his suspension, causing him to slam into the wall at turn 10 and ending his podium hopes. Norris had clipped the same wall just before Russell's crash but his car was undamaged. Having led the entire race, Sainz won the race, his first since the 2022 British Grand Prix and Ferrari's first since the 2022 Austrian Grand Prix, breaking Verstappen and Red Bull Racing's winning streak, with Norris claiming second place and Hamilton claiming third place after Russell's crash. In only his third race in Formula One, Liam Lawson scored his maiden points by finishing ninth, driving for AlphaTauri. Hamilton's finishing third and Alonso's fifteenth place meant Hamilton moved up from fourth to third in the championship.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

It was the sixteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship.\nMax Verstappen started from pole position, set the fastest lap and won the race for Red Bull Racing, allowing the Austrian constructor to win their sixth Constructors' Championship, their second consecutive win after . Mathematically, the team also effectively secured the Drivers' Championship, with Verstappen securing the championship at the Qatar Grand Prix sprint event. At that point, Sergio Pérez remained in the title contest behind Verstappen. Additionally, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both finished on the podium for McLaren, marking the team's first double podium since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix and Piastri's first career podium.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 22–24 September.

Valtteri Bottas, Lance Stroll, Nico Hülkenberg, and Zhou Guanyu were also knocked out. During the second segment, Liam Lawson, Pierre Gasly, Alexander Albon, Esteban Ocon and Kevin Magnussen were all knocked out while Charles Leclerc topped the session. During the third segment, Verstappen set the fastest lap, granting him pole position, bettering his own time by over a tenth to secure it. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris completed the top three.\nRace.\nThe race was held on 24 September 2023, at 14:00 local time (UTC+9).\nRace report.\nFollowing his Q1 crash the previous day, Williams engineers rebuilt the car of Logan Sargeant. However, using too many new replacement parts not from the original ones meant the car was deemed to be a third car, and Logan was given a ten-second time penalty to serve during the race. He also was required to start from the pit lane due to changes being made in parc fermé. \nAs the race began, Oscar Piastri dropped to third with Lando Norris taking his position. Meanwhile, Valtteri Bottas hit the car of Alexander Albon, bringing out the safety car due to excessive on-track debris. Lewis Hamilton was forced onto the grass after trying to pass Sergio Pérez, whose car was damaged by the contact; the Red Bull Racing driver went into the pit lane and swapped his front wing, dropping back into the race in last place. Pérez also received a five-second penalty for infringing on safety car regulations. Albon took a new front wing.\nIn lap 5, Bottas was hit by a locked-up Sargeant and retired four laps later after complaining of his car's handling, resulting in another five-second penalty for Sargeant. Pérez would then hit Kevin Magnussen, at turn 11 on lap 12. Debris on the circuit from the incident led to the virtual safety car being briefly deployed on lap 14 in order to allow the marshals to remove the debris. Meanwhile, Lance Stroll entered the pits and did not come out, and was soon joined in retirement by Albon. Both Mercedes ran wide at Spoon Curve as George Russell attempted to overtake his teammate who subsequently pitted for fresh tyres. Russell would pit later, running a one-stop strategy. There was confusion about Pérez's retirement from the race; having hit Magnussen earlier, he went into the pit lane and appeared to have retired. Several laps later he rejoined the race, was immediately called to box and then served his penalty, in a tactic designed to ensure the unserved penalty was not carried over to the following Qatar Grand Prix in the form of a grid penalty. Once the penalty was served, Pérez retired once again.\nAt this point, polesitter Max Verstappen led the field with a dominant 16 seconds ahead of second-placed Norris. Behind, Piastri passed Russell for third place. Soon, Charles Leclerc passed Russell for fourth. Verstappen won the race 20 seconds ahead of Norris and Piastri, the latter winning his first career podium position. Through Verstappen, who also set the fastest lap, Red Bull Racing won their sixth Constructors' Championship, their second in a row. Norris and Piastri's podium finish marked McLaren's first double podium since the 2021 Italian Grand Prix and Piastri's first career podium position.\nThis race was the first of two events to feature a special trophy designed by Lenovo, the title sponsor of the race, in collaboration with Pininfarina, that lit up in the colours of the winning driver's flag when a special button on the backside of the trophy is kissed.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

Verstappen, Sergio Pérez and polesitter Carlos Sainz Jr. of Ferrari made up the podium, Sainz's second podium at Monza Circuit. \nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 1–3 September. It was the fourteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship and the 93rd running of the Italian Grand Prix.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nComing into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 138 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Fernando Alonso third, a further 33 points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Mercedes by 285 points and Aston Martin by a further 40 points.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list, with the exception of Liam Lawson, who was in the seat originally held by Nyck de Vries. Felipe Drugovich drove for Aston Martin in place of Lance Stroll during the first practice session.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C3, C4 and C5 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nA reduction in allocated tyre sets from the standard 13 to 11, referred to as the Alternative Tyre Allocation (ATA), was trialled again during this Grand Prix, with the intention of making tyre usage more sustainable. This is the second and last time this season that it was trialled after the Hungarian Grand Prix. The usage of tyre compounds during qualifying was mandated as hard in Q1, medium in Q2 and soft in Q3, assuming that the weather is dry.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held for the event. The first practice session was held on 1 September 2023, at 13:30 local time (UTC+2). Max Verstappen topped the session, with Carlos Sainz Jr. recording the second-fastest time and Sergio Pérez recording the third-fastest.\nThe second practice session was held later that day at 17:00 local time (UTC+2). It was topped by Carlos Sainz Jr., with Lando Norris recording the second-fastest time and Sergio Pérez recording the third-fastest. The session was red-flagged early when Lance Stroll's fuel system failed, forcing him to sit out the rest of the session. It was later red-flagged again when Sergio Pérez spun into the gravel at turn 11. However, Pérez's crash was late enough in the session to retain the third-fastest time. The third practice session was held on 2 September 2023, at 12:30 local time (UTC+2), with Sainz topping the session ahead of Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on 2 September 2023, at 16:00 local time (UTC+2).\nQualifying report.\nMax Verstappen topped the first session, which was to be set on hard tyres, ahead of Alexander Albon and Charles Leclerc while Zhou Guanyu, Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon, Kevin Magnussen and Lance Stroll did not advance to the second session. Zhou, Oscar Piastri, who would recover by recording the eleventh-fastest time, Fernando Alonso and Verstappen had their lap times deleted due to track limits violations.\nThe second session, set to medium tyres, was also topped by Verstappen, ahead of Leclerc and Carlos Sainz Jr. This time, Yuki Tsunoda, Liam Lawson, Nico Hülkenberg, Valtteri Bottas and Logan Sargeant did not advance to the final qualifying session.\nThe third session was run on soft tyres. In his fastest lap, Verstappen's left-rear wheel snapped into the gravel but he still set the provisional fastest lap. However, Sainz beat Verstappen to pole by 0.013s, taking pole position in front of the Tifosi.\nRace.\nThe race was held on 3 September 2023, and was scheduled at 15:00 local time (UTC+2), but was delayed by 20 minutes due to an aborted start procedure.\nRace report.\nThe formation lap was aborted after Yuki Tsunoda broke down on track; his car was wheeled off via truck. Initially, the drivers were sent round for an additional formation lap, before a 20-minute delay was imposed. A third formation lap was held at the end of the delay, before the race start. As two unscheduled formation laps had taken place, the race distance was reduced by two laps.\nPolesitter Carlos Sainz Jr. had a good start and held off second-placed Max Verstappen for the first 14 laps. Even when Verstappen was allowed DRS, he was unable to make an overtake as Sainz continued to make a strong defence. Sainz locked up coming into the first corner on lap 15, giving Verstappen a chance. Verstappen eventually passed Sainz and led the race for the next five laps until he came in for a stop. Meanwhile, George Russell and Sergio Pérez were having their own fight for fourth place behind Charles Leclerc. On lap 14, Pérez was able to pass Russell at the first corner, but both cars missed the chicane and Pérez had to give the position back. Due to another incident against Esteban Ocon at the same corner after his stop, in which Russell overtook Ocon off the track, Russell was given a five-second penalty.\nBehind Verstappen, who quickly pulled several seconds ahead, the other drivers were having close battles, with Pérez and Leclerc duelling at the second corner. Lewis Hamilton made an error trying to pass Oscar Piastri, cutting across him in the braking zone of turn 4. Piastri's front wing was damaged and he had to make an unscheduled pit stop for repairs. Hamilton was given a five-second penalty for the collision but he had enough of a gap over Alexander Albon at the end to avoid losing any positions when the penalty was applied. Meanwhile, Sainz would run out of room at the first corner. He was forced not to only take the run-off area, but give Pérez second place. As the race was reaching its closing stages, Leclerc locked up twice and almost collided with Sainz. Sainz himself would lock up into the first corner as Verstappen won his second consecutive Italian Grand Prix. With ten consecutive wins since the Miami Grand Prix, this broke Sebastian Vettel's record of nine consecutive wins in a row – and Red Bull Racing extended their record of most consecutive wins for a constructor to 15, having won every race since the 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

It was the tenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship.\nThe race, which saw a record 480,000 people attend throughout the weekend, was won by polesitter Max Verstappen ahead of the McLaren of Lando Norris and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. This race also marked the last Grand Prix start to date of Dutch driver Nyck de Vries who was replaced at Scuderia AlphaTauri by Daniel Ricciardo from the next race at the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards.\nBackground.\nThe event was held across the weekend of 7–9 July. It was the tenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship and the 74th running of the British Grand Prix.\nChampionship standings before the race.\nComing into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 81 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Fernando Alonso third, a further 17 points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Mercedes by 199 points and Aston Martin by 202 points.\nEntrants.\nThe drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.\nThis Grand Prix was the last for Nyck de Vries, who was removed from his AlphaTauri seat two days after the race. De Vries was replaced by Daniel Ricciardo, who was the third driver for AlphaTauri's sister team Red Bull Racing, from the Hungarian Grand Prix onward.\nTyre choices.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2 and C3 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.\nFilming.\nThe Grand Prix was used as a filming set and background film for an untitled Formula One drama film. Pitt's run around Silverstone in a Formula 2 car would be inserted into racing scenes filmed from the race.\nPractice.\nThree free practice sessions were held for the event. Two one-hour sessions on 7 July and a one-hour practice session on 8 July, two hours before qualifying. The first session ended with Max Verstappen fastest ahead of Red Bull Racing teammate Sergio Pérez and Williams driver Alexander Albon. The second session ended with Verstappen fastest ahead of Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. and Albon. The third session ended with Charles Leclerc fastest, driving for Ferrari, ahead of Albon and Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on 8 July 2023, at 15:00 local time (UTC+1).\nQualifying report.\nQualifying was held under cloudy skies, with a small patch of rain during the closing moments the first segment of qualifying, Q1.\nOn his first qualifying lap, Lewis Hamilton spun at Stowe corner, sending him into the gravel and bringing out a brief yellow flag; he was able to recover back onto track. Following his spin, Hamilton looked at risk to face another Q1 elimination, but improved his time significantly. Max Verstappen and Alexander Albon both had lap times deleted for track limits violations. After the Haas of Kevin Magnussen broke down between the Stowe and Vale corners, a red-flag was shown with three-minutes to go in Q1 to allows it recovery. Albon was in the elimination zone as he had his lap times deleted again while Logan Sargeant ended up in the grass; following the restart, Albon would set a time for Q2 going seventh fastest. Meanwhile, Nyck de Vries was released onto the path of Oscar Piastri with no investigation being made. When pulling out of the garage to resume qualifying after the red flag, Verstappen understeered and hit the pit wall, breaking his front wing, which had to be replaced.\nWhen the session resumed, Sergio Pérez set the first time and topped the session, though other drivers improved with faster times, resulting in him being eliminated in Q1. This continued a streak of poor qualifying performances in which he failed to make Q3 (the third segment) on five consecutive occasions, with his teammate Verstappen securing pole in those races. The Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas broke down at the end of Q1; despite setting a time for Q2, he was unable to run in the rest of qualifying. Magnussen joined Pérez, Yuki Tsunoda, Zhou, and De Vries in being eliminated, with Lando Norris topping the session ahead of Charles Leclerc, George Russell, Hamilton, and Verstappen.\nThe second session (Q2) was delayed to allow the recovery of Bottas's car and saw the rain dissipate. As the session began, Lance Stroll and Sargeant's laps were deleted due to more track limits violations. Norris topped the session momentarily before Fernando Alonso, Albon, Leclerc and Sainz set faster times. Pierre Gasly, Piastri, Hamilton and Norris all set the fastest lap, with Verstappen securing fastest lap by session's end ahead of Piastri, Norris, Albon and Sainz. Bottas, who could not run any laps, joined Stroll, Ocon, Nico Hülkenberg, and Sargeant all out of qualifying in Q2.\nWith no threat of rain over the last ten minutes of qualifying, DRS was enabled. Verstappen took provisional pole after the initial laps, ahead of Hamilton and Piastri, before everyone pitted for new tyres. The drivers' second laps in Q3 saw Verstappen maintain his pole position with Norris and Piastri taking second and third respectively in McLaren's highest qualifying result of the season. Norris and Piastri were astonished by their respective performances during the session; Piastri said that it was a \"massive step in the right direction\" for the team.\nPost-qualifying.\nBottas was subsequently disqualified during post-qualification scrutineering due to insufficient fuel sample; he was allowed to start the race under stewards' discretion, though he was sent to last place.\nQualifying classification.\nNotes\nRace.\nThe race was held on 9 July 2023, at 15:00 local time (UTC+1).\nRace report.\nLando Norris got a better start off the line against polesitter Max Verstappen; he proceeded to lead the race for four laps before a DRS-assisted Verstappen overtook him by lap four. Verstappen would take the fastest lap and lead the rest of the race.\nAs the first lap began, numerous cars tussled at the rear of the field. Lewis Hamilton passed Pierre Gasly and would begin to chase Fernando Alonso, only to be held up behind him; he eventually passed him with a DRS move. Lance Stroll and Esteban Ocon fought for position before Ocon retired on lap 12 due to a hydraulics leak, Alexander Albon was in tenth.\nRain was reported during the race, but was not heavy enough to warrant the usage of wet weather tyres. Drivers began to change to differing types of dry tyres, with Yuki Tsunoda being the first to do so with a change onto the softs. Charles Leclerc changed onto hard compound tyres. At this point, Verstappen had extended his lead; meanwhile, Norris, who turned his attention to the drivers behind him, felt satisfied with his pace. His teammate Oscar Piastri, reacting to Pérez's stop, changed his tyres and rejoined ahead of Leclerc and George Russell.\nThe Ferrari power unit in Kevin Magnussen's Haas caught fire on lap 32, forcing his retirement. The virtual safety car was initially deployed, this was later upgraded to a full safety car. The safety car allowed the field to change their tyres. Hamilton jumped Piastri and Russell in the pit lane and came out in third place. The Ferrari drivers of Carlos Sainz Jr. and Leclerc were unlucky with the two losing positions during the stop. Meanwhile, Zhou Guanyu reported brake issues.\nOn the safety car restart, Verstappen kept the lead until the end as numerous battles were occurring behind him. Hamilton was behind Norris and was unsuccessful in his attempts to overtake. Albon and Leclerc also had a battle through the final laps. Stroll made contact with Gasly's rear-right suspension, which forced the latter into retirement. Stroll was given a five-second penalty for the incident. Sergio Pérez recovered from qualifying fifteenth to finish in sixth place.\nVerstappen's victory was his first British Grand Prix win and his second at Silverstone after his triumph at the 2020 70th Anniversary Grand Prix. Norris' second place was his and McLaren's first podium since the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix and his joint best Formula One result, having previously finished second at the 2021 Italian Grand Prix. The podiums of Hamilton and Norris ensured that this was the first time since David Coulthard and Eddie Irvine finished first and second, respectively, in the 1999 British Grand Prix that two home drivers representing the United Kingdom stood on the podium together in the race. Norris also became the first British driver other than Hamilton to score a podium position on home soil since Coulthard did so with victory at the 2000 British Grand Prix.\nRace classification.\nNotes"

The Moroccan government invested in seaside tourism infrastructure in Taghazhout Bay surf village as part of the 2001 Azur Plan, with the aim of creating 20,000 jobs for local people.

        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. \nMost of the career leaders are relatively recent players who have benefitted from improved infield defense, with equipment of better quality; only six of the top 25 players made their major league debut before 1966, none of them before 1944. Only seven of the top 84 single-season totals were recorded before 1949, and only two of the top 152 were recorded before 1918. Brooks Robinson holds the record for the most career double plays by a third baseman with 618. "

        "title": "Preston North End Baseball Club",
        "text": "Preston North End Baseball Club were a short lived English professional baseball club, who played their home games at Deepdale, competing for the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain. Preston North End Baseball Club Limited were formally established on 21 June 1890, with £2,000 in £10 shares, with the Directors being Thomas Slaney, William Sudell, J. Brown (both of Preston North End), Morton Betts, Jim Hart and Newton Crane, and were registered by Richard Barnes.\nBallpark.\nDue to being owned by the President of Preston North End and playing games during summer, when football was not played, the baseball club were able to use Deepdale Stadium.\n1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain.\nPreston hosted Derby Baseball Club on 21 June 1890, the first baseball game to be played at Deepdale, with Derby winning 6–9. A crowd estimated to be either 300 or 500 spectators cheered on Preston in their second game, versus Aston Villa at Perry Barr Stadium, Birmingham. It was noted that this crowd was nearly three times larger than the opening day attendance. Interestingly, it was reported that \"it was openly whispered around the field on Saturday that Mr. Fancis Ley, the presiding deity of the Derby baseball club had promised the Deepdale players so much a man in the event of taking down the Brums\". This is telling, as the league ended acrimoniously, amid accusations of cheating. Things remained unsettled for Preston in the early weeks of the championship, when some of the players, who had been paid to practice since May, reportedly refused to sign professional terms for the club.\nIn August Preston travelled with Aston Villa to put on an exhibition game at Cathkin Park in Glasgow. At this point the captain of Preston, Leech Maskrey returned to his native United States, having been presented with a gold watch chain and fob by his teammates. In November 'Sir' John Woods, Chairman of both Preston North End and Preston North End Baseball Club visited Philadelphia, and made comments to the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\" regarding the success of baseball in Britain, comments which were subsequently picked up and printed by the local press in Preston. Woods appears to have claimed that his baseball club had won the national championship and that his football were the \"champion association football club of the world\"! Woods went on to praise his long time partner in organising sports in Preston, William Sudell, for his efforts in establishing baseball in England, stating that Spalding had personally come to Preston North End to ask for Sudell and Woods to take on the responsibility for creating a national baseball championship. Financially the season had been a success, with Preston charging spectators a 3d. admission fee per game, and \"their expenses were nothing like that amount\".\nProfessional roster.\n\"W. Livesey was a sprinter of some regional notoriety who played as a reserve for Preston North End, local rugby union and as a professional baseball player for Preston North End. He was killed in 1893.\"\n\"J. Brown, Colford and Maskrey were all American professionals.\"\n1890 Amateur Championship Baseball Cup winners.\nIn August 1890 an amateur side was formed. On 29 September, at Perry Barr Stadium in Birmingham, the Preston amateur side met with their counterparts from Aston Villa. Preston scored an amazing 42 runs, which was said to be a British record. F. Brown, captain of the amateur side, was presented with the Amateur Championship Baseball Cup of Great Britain, the trophy was provided by Spalding and Co. and was put on display in Preston Town Hall.\nPost professionalism and demise.\nPreston North End were adamant that they were committed to professional baseball and would be fielding both professional and amateur teams in the 1891 season but by June 1891 the local press were bemoaning that there were no professional teams for Preston to play, and that Derby, who had been professional in 1890, were unwilling to play Preston without assurances the game wouldn't be \"fixed\". The conclusion was that the people of Preston should follow baseball organisers in Derby and establish a prominent local amateur community first, before attempting professionalism again. In any case the two clubs managed to arrange a four-game series, with Preston Secretary Mr Nuttall agreeing to two games at each stadium. Crowds of 700 then 1,000 attended the two games of the series hosted at Preston which suggests that locally in Preston baseball remained a viable professional sport. In May 1892 Preston took on a representative 'All England' team for 2,000 spectators at Belle Vue Stadium. Mr Lawson, President of an amateur New York Baseball Club was received in Preston by Suddell, who arranged for a baseball game to be played at Deepdale for his entertainment.\nIn October 'Sir' John Woods passed away at his home in Preston, aged just 42. Woods was a partner in the famous Preston tobacco manufacturers W.H. and J Woods and along with Sudell was one of the founders in athletic meetings in Preston, that led to the formation of Preston North End Preston North End, of whom he was still a Committee member at the time of his death. In their next game, versus Blackburn Rovers, the football club players wore black armbands and the flag on the main gate was flown at half mast. The baseball club then appears to have become fully defunct.\nShelved plans for a revival.\nIn August 1933 it was proposed that a new \"first class\" Preston Baseball Club be formed for the following year, and that it would apply to join the Lancashire Baseball League. A game under the code of the English Baseball Union was played at Preston on 26 August, to promote the sport ahead of this new club's formation. This match, and the endeavour to bring baseball back to Preston, was organised by J. Pickworth-Hutchinson. This exhibition game between a Preston team featuring no men from Preston took place at Farringdon Park, a Liverpool representative team were the opponents. It was hoped that, as in 1890, both sides would feature prominent footballers from their respective local Football League clubs, crowds of over 5,000 was expected. Pickworth-Hutchinson hoped that the rosters of the clubs in the new Lancashire League would once again be full of football stars, hoping to keep fit during the summer off-season."

Defending discipline champion Marco Odermatt of Switzerland opened over a 100-point lead in the discipline by winning four of the first five races and finishing third in the other, although he then missed a race due to injury. Odermatt clinched the discipline championship by winning both giant slaloms on 11-12 March in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The men's giant slalom was held in Courchevel on 17 February.\nThe World Cup final took place on Saturday, 18 March 2023, in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship in the discipline, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 finishers earned World Cup points in the discipline.\nStandings.\nLegend.\nUpdated at 18 March 2023 after all events."

        "text": "Wally Green (born 1979) is an American table tennis player. He has played for the U.S. in more than 35 International Pro Tour competitions.\nEarly life.\nGreen grew up in a low-income housing project in Brooklyn, New York. He became part of a gang and his juvenile rap sheet included carjacking and gun possession. He was shot twice, says that he grew up with domestic violence, and that he owned six guns when he was 13 years old. He was sent to boarding school in Nigeria for a time, and in New York he went to Lafayette High School. At Lafayette, he played basketball, football and volleyball, among other sports.\nTable tennis.\nGreen started playing table tennis due to a chance encounter at a pool hall, and discovered that other black people played the game. Playing sports was also a way to avoid his step-father. He found a mentor, who paid for him to train in Hanover, Germany. He played his first International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) game as global pro in 2001 in Germany. During the following years, he didn't win a lot, but he traveled globally, camera crews noticed him and Rockstar Games became his sponsor. According to \"The New York Times\", he \"brought charisma and showmanship\" to the sport. He won his first international match in the 2009 Korea Open.\nIn 2015, he decided to participate as the only Westerner in the Pyongyang Open in North Korea. He said later that \"I wanted the North Koreans to realize that Americans aren't their enemies\" and, about playing in front of 5,000 North Koreans, that \"You can feel the eyes of everyone looking at you because you're very different ... It's the most eerie, like really strange, feeling.\"\nGreen stopped competing internationally in 2016. His record in ITTF events is one match won in singles, and two in doubles. In 2018 he said \"I'm not the best player in the world, but I'm definitely the coolest. I'm sure of it. That beats being the best.\" He credits table tennis with saving his life.\nOther activities.\nGreen was involved in the promotion of the 2006 video game \"Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis\" in Tokyo, and provided motion capture for one of the characters. In 2009, he co-founded the table tennis franchise SPiN with, among others, Susan Sarandon. On his initiative, table tennis tables were installed in Bryant Park in New York City, initially as marketing for SPiN.\nIn 2013, he released a hip-hop song called \"A Game Nobody Knows (Ping Pong Song)\". In 2022, he was featured in Unanimous Media's \"The Greatest Sports Stories Never Told\".\nPersonal life.\nGreen suffered from pain for several years, and underwent hip resurfacing in 2018."

        "title": "English cricket team in India in 2023–24",
        "text": "The England cricket team toured India from January to March 2024 to play five Test matches. The Test series formed part of the 2023–2025 ICC World Test Championship. The teams competed for the Anthony de Mello Trophy. The series overlapped with the first-class series between India A and England Lions, which took place in January and February 2024.\nIn the first Test, England recovered from a first innings deficit of 190 to win by 28 runs. Ollie Pope scored 196 in England's second innings, and then debutant Tom Hartley took 7/62 to seal the win.\nIn the second Test, India posted 396 in their first innings. However, a strong counter from England reduced the deficit to 143. Aided by a century from Shubman Gill, India posted a 399 run lead. England saw initial success in their second innings, but a combined bowling attack by Jasprit Bumrah and Ravichandran Ashwin saw India win by 106 runs, and level the series at 1-1. Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 209, a career-best performance, in India's first innings.\nIn the third Test, India posted 445 in their first innings. A good spell from Ben Duckett helped England reduce the deficit to 126. In excellent form, Yashasvi Jaiswal scored 214* (another career best performance) to help India post a 557 run lead. England were all out for 122, majorly due to a 5 wicket haul by Ravindra Jadeja. India won by 434 runs (the biggest ever Indian win in terms of runs), and took a lead in the series at 2-1.\nThe fourth Test saw a century from Joe Root in the first innings, but England were halted at 353 with Ravindra Jadeja taking 4 wickets. India could not close the lead set by England despite Dhruv Jurel scoring 90 runs and were halted by Shoaib Bashir's maiden 5 wicket haul. England set a 192 run lead in their second innings after being curtailed by Ravichandran Ashwin's 5 wicket haul. A 72 run partnership by Dhruv Jurel and Shubman Gill helped India secure the series win.\nIn the final record breaking test, India bowled out England early before Rohit and Gill both scored centuries, setting a target of 477. The 100th test of both Ashwin and Bairstow, this match saw for the first time ever, a test series having more than 100 sixes hit. India eventually bowled England out again to clinch an innings win.\nBackground.\nIn the 131 Tests played between the two teams before the series, England had won and drawn 50 each, and lost 31. In India, they had won 14 and lost 22, while 28 matches ended in draws. In a total of 16 series played in India between the two sides, the hosts had won eight and lost five. England were the last visiting side to win a Test series in India, in 2012–13. The last Test series between the two sides, played in England, and interrupted by COVID-19, had ended in a 2–2 draw. However, India boasted an enviable record playing at home, having won 36 of the 46 Tests played over the previous decade. India's previous Test outing was a 1–1 draw away from home against South Africa, while England last featured in a 2–2 draw in the Ashes at home. Ahead of the series, England and India were ranked number three and two in the ICC Men's Test Team Rankings. \nGoing into the series, England had been playing the Bazball style of cricket for over two years. They had won 13 of the 18 Tests played in this fashion. The away India series was touted by the English media as its ultimate test. \"The Telegraph\" wrote: \"India will be the ultimate stress test of the first rule of Bazball, which is to be endlessly positive.\" Captain Ben Stokes had stated that India was the \"hardest place to come and win a game, let alone a series\". Their top-order batter Ollie Pope had earlier stated that England would use \"Bazball as hard as ever in India\". England's coach Brendon McCullum stated that \"India is the best in their own condition. It is going to be a good challenge for us. If we have success, then fabulous; if we don't, then I know we will go down in the style that we want to go down.\" However, former English Test captain Michael Vaughan warned that the English side might get \"absolutely destroyed\" against an Indian side that has superb spinners. Former batter Kevin Pietersen, part of the team that won there in 2012–13, said that England's performance would be dictated by how their spinners perform. He stated, \"It's how England's spinners bowl. Don't worry about Bazball. I'm sure they'll get their runs because it's the most beautiful place to bat. In the first innings, it's a great place to bat. If they get enough runs, [it's] all about how the spinners bowl.\" \nThe Indian media too speculated the viability and the potential success of Bazball on Indian soil. \"The Hindu\" wrote that for Bazball to work in India \"requires sound technique rather than quick reflexes. It will all depend on how much the England batters allow these two Indian spinners (Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja) to take up space in their heads. England need to bat long and positively to put pressure on India. It is their best chance.\"\nFormer English captain Michael Atherton felt that India were favorites to win the series, while former paceman Steve Harmison felt the \"underprepared\" English side \"deserve[d] to get beat 5–0\". Criticism was directed at the English preparation after the squad decided against playing a tour game in India, instead holding a 11-day training camp in Abu Dhabi.\nSquads.\nThe England squad for the tour was announced by the England Cricket Board on 11 December 2023. Three uncapped players made the squad — Surrey paceman Gus Atkinson and off spinners Tom Hartley (Lancashire) and Shoaib Bashir (Somerset). On 21 January 2024, Harry Brook withdrew from the tour due to personal reasons and was replaced in the squad by Dan Lawrence. The squad arrived in India the following day after holding a training camp in Abu Dhabi. Bashir had returned home from Abu Dhabi in order to resolve a visa delay that prevented him from travelling to India with the rest of the squad. However, he joined the squad in Hyderabad after belatedly receiving his visa, a few days later.\nIndia's squad for the first two Tests of the series was announced on 12 January 2024. KS Bharat and Dhruv Jurel were named in the squad as wicketkeeper-batsmen. Mohammed Shami, still recovering from the injury he sustained during the World Cup the previous year, was not named. Virat Kohli withdrew from the first two Tests due to personal reasons on 22 January; Rajat Patidar was named his replacement.\nOn 29 January, after the First Test, injured KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja were ruled out of the Second, and Sarfaraz Khan, Saurabh Kumar and Washington Sundar were added to India's squad. Two days later, England's Jack Leach was ruled out of the Second Test with a bruised knee. He was later ruled out of the series. Rahul and Jadeja were named in the squad for the final three matches, subject to medical clearances. Shreyas Iyer and Avesh Khan were dropped, Kohli remained unavailable for selection, and Akash Deep earned his first Test call-up. An injured Rahul was replaced by Devdutt Padikkal in India's squad. Khan and Jurel made their debut in the Third Test. For the Fourth Test, Jasprit Bumrah was rested, while Rahul still remained unavailable for selection.\nOn 23 February 2024, England's Rehan Ahmed was ruled out from the last two Tests due to personal reasons"

        "text": "The women's giant slalom in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup included ten events, including the final. The season was scheduled to open in Sölden, Austria on 22 October 2022, but the race was cancelled due to bad weather and rescheduled to Semmering, Austria on 27 December.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's giant slalom was held in Méribel on 16 February.\nSeason Summary.\nAfter six races, 2021 discipline champion Marta Bassino of Italy, who had podiumed in five of them (one win, two seconds, and two thirds), held a slim lead over 2019 discipline champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, who had three wins, in the season standings. However, Shiffrin's victory in the seventh race (her fourth win) not only propelled her into the discipline lead for the season but also broke Lindsey Vonn's all-time women's record for World Cup victories, as it was Shiffrin's 83rd overall win. Shiffrin's later victory in Åre, Sweden (her sixth giant slalom win of the season) gave her the season championship with one race remaining and also enabled her to tie two records: Ingemar Stenmark's all-time overall record of 86 World Cup wins, and Vreni Schneider's all-time women's record of 20 giant slalom victories.\nShiffrin then broke Schneider's women's record for giant slalom victories by winning the finals, her seventh World Cup victory in the discipline for the season and her 21st career victory in the discipline (but still trailing Stenmark, who had 46, as well as three other men: Marcel Hirscher (31), Ted Ligety (24), and Michael von Grünigen (23)). Also, Switzerland's Lara Gut-Behrami, who finished fourth, moved past Bassino, who finished sixth, into second place in the discipline for the season.\nThe World Cup finals took place on Sunday, 19 March 2023 in Soldeu, Andorra, which previously hosted the finals in 2019. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup giant slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points."

        "text": "Cycling in Turkey is held back by poor infrastructure. It is sometimes done for health reasons, and infrastructure is being improved. The World Health Organization has called for transport in Turkey to include more active transport such as cycling.\nHistory.\nAt first the Ottomans cycled for transport and later also for sport. The army used bicycles. Many women in Turkey cycled, and cycling helped the feminist movement towards the end of the Ottoman Empire. Thomas Stevens went through Constantinople on his round the world trip, as did others later in the 19th century, publishing accounts such as \"Across Asia on a Bicycle: The Journey of Two American Students from Constantinople to Peking\".\nRahmi Koç Museum has a display of bicycles.\nUtility cycling.\nA 2019 survey of Turkish college students found that 10 percent of cyclists wear a bike helmet. Respondents to a 2018 survey in Isparta said that Accident Prone Areas were the most important factor for integration with public transport. Some of the bike lanes created in that city in 2016 were removed in 2018, partly because roadside businesses wanted the space for car parking.\nPolicy and manufacturing.\nThe Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation and Climate Change has published a guide for cycle paths. There is not much data available to help plan where bicycle routes should go.\nInfrastructure.\nIn 2019 a new regulation on cycle paths was issued, but according to a 2020 study cities are not bike friendly. Cycle paths are sometimes not well connected. In 2021 a bicycle route master plan was published.\nSuggestions have been made for Istanbul. Improvements were made in Istanbul during the COVID-19 pandemic. Locations close to shorelines are thought to be best for bike sharing stations. Konya has the most bike lanes with over . Bikes (except tandems) are allowed on the Istanbul metro outside peak hours and if folded at any time. The city's sustainable urban mobility plan in 2022 suggested cycle feeder routes and junction improvements.\nHatay claimed to have opened in 2020 the longest uninterrupted bike path in the world. Some of Turkey's bike paths have been integrated into the EuroVelo route network. The EV13 The Iron Curtain Trail follows of the border with Bulgaria via Edirne. Around of existing bike paths in İzmir were incorporated into the EV8 The Mediterranean Route in 2019.\nFor sport and recreation.\nThe governing organisation for cycle sport in Turkey is the Turkish Cycling Federation. There is a velodrome in Istanbul.\nThere are cycling festivals. Dogs such as Kangal can be a problem in rural areas, and some recommend dismounting.\nRides.\nFancy Women Bike Ride (Turkish: Süslü Kadinlar Bisiklet Turu ) was started by Sema Gur, a high school teacher from Turkey. In 2013, three hundred women from Izmir, Turkey, participated in a Chic Women Bike Ride, which in subsequent years grew as an annual international event known as the Fancy Women Bike Ride on Car-Free Days. For the Fancy Women Bike Ride, women decorate their bikes and instead of wearing sporty biking gear, they dress and make themselves up as colorfully and fancifully as they like.\nRules.\nBicycles include electric bicycles whose maximum continuous rated power does not exceed 250 W, whose power decreases as they accelerate, and whose power is completely cut off after reaching a maximum speed of 25 km/h or immediately after the pedaling is interrupted. To ride on a highway cyclists must be over 11 and physically and mentally healthy. All traffic rules apply to cyclists. Helmets are not obligatory."

        "text": "Scott Foster (born April 8, 1967) is an American professional basketball referee for the National Basketball Association (NBA). He began officiating games for the NBA in the 1994–95 season and wears number 48.\nNicknamed \"The Extender\" because teams trailing in playoff series have often won games he has officiated, thus lengthening the number of games played, Foster's refereeing has drawn criticism from fans and players. In an anonymized survey of nearly three dozen NBA players by the Los Angeles Times in 2016, and a separate anonymized survey of 108 NBA players by The Athletic in 2023, he was voted the worst referee in the NBA.\nEarly life.\nFoster was born on April 8, 1967, in Silver Spring, Maryland. He attended Magruder High School, and then the University of Maryland.\nOfficiating career.\nBefore his career in the NBA, Foster worked as a referee for two years in the Continental Basketball Association and in college basketball, and for six years in high school basketball. As of the 2021–22 NBA season, he had officiated 1,617 regular-season games and 226 playoff games in 28 seasons. One of his most notable games was the deciding Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics; he officiated along with Danny Crawford and Joey Crawford.\nCritics of Foster in the NBA have asserted he has assessed technical fouls for seemingly arbitrary reasons, missed crucial foul calls, and favored teams. James Harden called Foster “rude and arrogant.”\nFoster's relationship with former NBA referee Tim Donaghy, who pled guilty to two federal charges for fixing games, has also been called into question. According to court records, Donaghy made 134 phone calls to Foster between October 2006 and April 2007, during which time Donaghy admitted to betting on games or passing on game information to gamblers. The majority of the calls lasted less than two minutes and occurred prior to and after games Donaghy officiated and on which he admitted to gambling on. In March 2024, NBA player Rudy Gobert was fined $100,000 for rubbing his fingers together in a so-called money gesture at Foster during a game. Gobert later implied, in a postgame interview, that Foster is an unfair officiator while raising the issue of gambling's influence on the sport."

        "text": "The women's slalom in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of eleven events, including the final. The original schedule also called for eleven events, but a night slalom at Zagreb on 5 January was cancelled due to high winds and warm weather and not immediately rescheduled. However, a week later (12 January), the race was rescheduled as a second slalom at Špindlerův Mlýn on 28 January, accompanied by a shift of the giant slalom scheduled there that day to Kronplatz on 25 January. \nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's slalom was held in Méribel on 18 February.\nSeason summary.\nAfter setting an all-time World Cup record by finishing in the top 3 in a discipline 30 times without ever recording a race win in that discipline, Wendy Holdener of Switzerland won both the third and fourth slaloms of the year to finally end that streak.\nHowever, after the first 8 races, Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, who had won five of them and finished second in two others, led the season standings by 175 points. Holdener was in second place, and defending discipline champion Petra Vlhová of Slovakia was 20 points further back in third. In the ninth race, Shiffrin finished second by 0.06 seconds, but she clinched the season title in the discipline with a 255-point lead over Holdener and Vlhová with just two races to go. In the next slalom at Åre, Sweden, Shiffrin's victory was her 87th World Cup victory, surpassing the all-time record of 86 set by Swedish technical specialist Ingemar Stenmark in the 1970s-1980s. Meanwhile, Holdener held off Vhlová by 25 points to claim second.\nThe World Cup finals in women's slalom took place on Saturday, 18 March 2023, in Soldeu, Andorra, which previously hosted the finals in 2019. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup slalom discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points."

        "text": "The women's overall competition in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of 38 events in four disciplines: downhill (DH) (9 races), super-G (SG) (8 races), giant slalom (GS) (10 races), and slalom (SL) (11 races). The fifth and sixth disciplines, parallel (PAR). and Alpine combined (AC), had all events in the 2022–23 season cancelled, either due to the schedule disruption cased by the COVID-19 pandemic (AC) or due to bad weather (PAR). The original schedule called for 42 races, but in addition to the parallel, two downhills and a super-G were cancelled during the season.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France, which are located in Les Trois Vallées, from 6–19 February 2023.\nSeason summary.\nFrom the very first race of the season, defending champion (and four-time overall champion) Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States seized the lead in the standings due to her abilities in all four disciplines. After the first thirteen races, she had built over a 300-point lead over 2021 overall champion Petra Vlhová of Slovakia. In addition, with her victory in a slalom at Semmering, Austria on December 29, Shiffrin, 27, became only the third skier (and second woman) to win 80 World Cup races, as well as the first ever to win 50 races in a single discipline. \nAfter 24 races, almost two-thirds of the season, Shiffrin held a lead of over 500 points over Vlhová, with 2016 overall champion Lara Gut-Behrami of Switzerland close behind in third; however, the focus of the moment was on Shiffrin's quest to break Lindsey Vonn's all-time women's record of 82 World Cup victories (which she had already tied) and then Ingemar Stenmark's all-time overall record of 86 such victories. She shattered Vonn's record with victories in back-to-back giant slaloms in Kronplatz on 24-25 January, increasing her overall lead (now with Gut-Behrami in second) to over 600 points. \nBy the end of January, which was the time for the break for the 2023 World Ski Championships, Shiffrin had 11 wins on the season (1 in super-G and 5 each in giant slalom and slalom) and 85 wins for her career. Shiffrin's fifth-place finish in a downhill at Kvitfjell on 4 March was sufficient to clinch the season championship, although there were still seven races left in the season. The overall title represented Shiffrin's fifth, tying her with Luxembourg's Marc Girardelli, who also won five, and placed her behind only two Austrians: Annemarie Moser-Pröll, who won six in the 1970s, and Marcel Hirscher, who won eight in a row in the 2010s. \nShiffrin's later victories in both a giant slalom and a slalom at Åre, Sweden (her sixth of the season in each discipline) enabled her to equal and then break Ingemar Stenmark's all-time overall record of 86 World Cup wins (with 87), as well as tying Vreni Schneider's all-time women's record of 20 giant slalom victories (to go along with her all-time record 53 slalom wins, plus 5 super-Gs, 5 parallels, 3 downhills, and 1 combined). And to top the season off a week later, Shiffrin won the giant slalom at finals, breaking Schneider's women's career victory record in that discipline with 21 and also breaking Lindsey Vonn's record for career World Cup podiums with 138 (in only her 249th World Cup start).\nIndicative of the degree of specialization in the World Cup this season (despite the end of the COVID separation between the speed skiers and the technical skiers) is that Shiffrin was the only skier, male or female, to place in the top 25 in all four disciplines, and only four women and one man even scored points in all four disciplines: Shiffrin, Federica Brignone (#4), Michelle Gisin (#13), and Franziska Gritsch (#23) among the women, and Marco Schwarz (#7) among the men.\nFinals.\nThe last events of the season took place at the World Cup finals, Wednesday, 15 March 2023 through Sunday, 19 March 2023 in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 in each specific discipline for the season and the winner of the Junior World Championship in each discipline were eligible to compete in the finals, with the exception that any skier who has scored at least 500 points in the overall classification was eligible to participate in any discipline, regardless of her standing in that discipline for the season."

The team currently operates an unofficial club team but the university previously sponsored varsity ice hockey between 1936 and 1941.\nHistory.\nThe first attempt at forming an ice hockey team at Lafayette came in the 1920s. While nothing materialized at the time, the students did eventually put together the first unofficial hockey club in 1935. Finding ice time was difficult without a local rink, however, there was enough interest from the student body that the school allowed a formal team to be formed two years later. Arranged and coached by then-Athletic Director Henry W. Clark, who was aided by Religious Studies professor Dale H. Moore, Lafayette played its first official game in February 1937. A few weeks later, the team won its first game by defeating nearby rival Lehigh.\nAfter a second season, the school decided to discontinue its support for the team, which then continued in an unofficial capacity. A successful campaign from the student body restored the team's varsity status in 1939 and was followed by the club's entry into a small conference. While Lafayette now had a little more stability with its schedule, the biggest impediment for the club remained; it did not possess a home rink. The lack of attention from the student body caused the number of prospective player to sharply decline after the team's first winning season and the program was mothballed in 1942.\nAfter World War II, the team was reformed, however, it only did so in an unofficial capacity. The club continued for a few years before disappearing altogether. In the succeeding years it has resurfaced but there have been no attempts to return it to varsity status.\nSeason-by-season results.\nVarsity.\nSource:"

Featuring sixty-four teams, it was played in March 2023, following the 2022–23 season, concluding with the championship game on March 18, 2023.\nThe national semifinal and championship rounds were held at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Christopher Newport won their first national championship, beating Mount Union 74–72 on a buzzer-beating layup by Trey Barber.\nTournament schedule and venues.\nFirst and second round games were played at campus sites on March 3 and March 4.\nOn the basis of team strength and geography, these locations were chosen to host first and second round games in the 2023 tournament:\nThird and fourth round games were played at campus sites on March 10 and March 11.\nAt the conclusion of the second round, the NCAA announced the following locations would host third and fourth round games.\nThe National Semifinals and Championship were played on March 16 and March 18.\nFort Wayne hosted the Final Four for the third time, having previously hosted in 2019 and 2022. Fort Wayne was also scheduled to host the Final Four in 2020 and 2021, before those editions of the tournament were canceled due to COVID-19 concerns.\nQualifying teams.\nA total of sixty-four bids were available for the tournament: 44 automatic bids—awarded to the champions of the forty-three NCAA-recognized Division III conference tournaments—and 20 at-large bids.\nWhile this was the first season for the newly established Collegiate Conference of the South, its conference tournament champion was not eligible for an automatic bid until the 2025 tournament.\nThis was also the final year that the Colonial States Athletic Conference and New England Collegiate Conference received bids; the members of the CSAC merged into the United East Conference ahead of the 2023–24 season, consolidating its bid into the UEC's as part of the process. Meanwhile, after steady losses of membership in recent years, the four remaining members of the NECC joined other conferences for 2023–24 and beyond.\nAutomatic bids (44).\nThe following 44 teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2023 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid (except for the UAA, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nAt-large bids (20).\nThe following 20 teams were awarded qualification for the tournament field by the NCAA Division III Men's Basketball Committee. The committee evaluated teams on the basis of their win–loss percentage, strength of schedule, head-to-head results, results against common opponents, and results against teams included in the NCAA's final regional rankings."

Teams were sent to one of 16 locations, each hosted by one team from the group of four.\nThe third and fourth rounds (sectional semifinals and finals) also took place at campus sites from March 10–11, 2023.

It was also the final year for the New England Collegiate Conference as an all-sports league. After steady losses of membership in recent years, it had only four members in the 2022–23 season. All four would join other conferences for 2023–24 and beyond.\nBrackets.\nSource\nSectional hosting controversy.\nWhen sectional hosts were announced on March 5, there was some controversy as three of the four hosts were placed in the state of Massachusetts and all four in the Eastern Time Zone. Most of the controversy came when Tufts, with its 21–6 regular season record, was granted hosting rights over 26–1 Trinity (TX), with top seed Christopher Newport unable to host due to the men's sectional being held at CNU the same weekend. Three teams would have to travel via air regardless of where the pod was placed, an unusual occurrence for a Division III sectional. D3sports.com's Pat Coleman observed \"[Division III] Texas teams get screwed so often [\"by the NCAA\"], in every sport. This was a chance for a makeup call that was sorely missed, and it's an example Texas teams can point to and say, even when the number of flights is equal, we still get screwed.\" Further analysis by Coleman showed a long-standing NCAA policy to deny sectional hosts in Texas or the larger Region 10 (which also includes the states of Colorado, California, Oregon, and Washington). Since the sectional concept was introduced to the men's and women's tournaments in 2000, there had been 84 sectionals in each tournament through the 2023 editions. On the women's side, no Region 10 school had hosted a sectional since 2014, and the previous Region 10 host had done so in 2008, meaning that only one of the past 56 sectionals had been held in Region 10. The perceived snubbing of Region 10 was even greater in the men's tournament; only one sectional had been held in Region 10, with none since 2004."

Within those areas, the lists identify single-game, single-season, and career leaders. The Musketeers represent Xavier University in the NCAA's Big East Conference.\nXavier began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1919. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Xavier's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

        "text": "William Berkley (14 June 1904 – 19 May 1973) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nBerkley played for Oxford University. He was given an 'Oxford Blue' for playing Cambridge University from 1924 to 1926.\nAfter playing for Oxford he then moved to play for London Scottish.\nHis London Scottish and international career was curtailed by Berkley moving to the East, he returned on furlough to play in the 1929 Five Nations Championship and the Exiles side again.\nInternational career.\n\"The Scotsman\" newspaper of 21 December 1925 noted this on Berkley's call up to the Scotland squad:\nAs W . V . Berkley was not even called upon for the trial on Saturday, his inclusion came as a complete surprise. It was not generally known that he had a Scottish qualification. His qualification, however, is quite a sound one, and is on the maternal side. His father is a clergyman in England, and both father and son are Old Fettesians. He showed excellent form in the three matches which Oxford University have played in Scotland recently and proved the best of the Oxonian forwards.\nHe was capped 4 times by Scotland in the period 1926–29. He played in both the 1926 Five Nations Championship and the 1929 Five Nations Championship, both of which Scotland won.\nHis later selection in the 1928–29 season also caused a surprise. The \"Dundee Evening Telegraph\" of 9 January 1929 reporting:\nShortly after the team was published. I heard many comments on the matter, and these could summed up in three questions:— \"Who this W. V. Berkley?\"; \"What club does Berkley belong to?\"; and \"Where has Berkley been?\" No doubt these questions are reflected in the minds of the majority of Scottish Rugby enthusiasts, and the people cannot be blamed for their curiosity. Berkley played against France in 1926 but was immediately dropped, and even the wisest and most experienced of critics had no idea of forecasting him for a place in this year's team. He was an outstanding member of the Oxford University pack in seasons 1924-25-26; is now home from abroad, and on the last Saturday of December played for London Scottish. He has been chosen without playing in a single trial match, an experience which also befell him in 1926.\nTeaching career.\nHe became a headmaster in 1952 at The Downs Malvern, Colwall in Herefordshire, and stayed there till 1969.\nFamily.\nHis father was the Reverend. Maurice Berkley (1872-1947), and his mother Grace McDonnell (1876-1957). They had 2 sons, including William, and 2 daughters.\nWilliam Berkley married Edith Greenstock (1908-1991) in India in 1936.\nDeath.\nHe died at the age of 68 years old, not long after his retirement as a teacher. He is buried in Shillingstone Churchyard in Dorset."

        "text": "The 1947–48 Harvard Crimson men's ice hockey season was the 48th season of play for the program. The Crimson represented Harvard University and were coached by John Chase in his 4th season.\nSeason.\nAfter having played just 20 games over the previous 2 seasons, Harvard was ready to finally shake off the last vestiges of World War II by putting together a 22-game slate, the most ambitious in the history of the program. Before the first game could be played, however, the Crimson encountered problems. One of the team's starting defensemen, Charlie Coulter, contracted viral pneumonia and would be out until after Christmas. His partner, Lou Preston, who was talented enough to be a candidate for the US Olympic Team, was then placed on probation and would be unavailable until after the mid-year exams. Without his top two blueliners, coach Chase had to rearrange the defense quickly for the team's opening games. Luckily for Harvard, Boston College was dealing with roster problems of their own while Brown was playing its first game in 9 years. This enabled the Crimson to open the year with a pair of wins.\nHarvard's aspirations were diminished in after the third game when Harvard was thumped by Boston University but the team had the chance to show how good it was with a subsequent 5-game road trip that would tame them through Canada and out into the Midwest. The trip could hardly have gone worse for the Crimson as the team lost all 5 games and most by sizable margins. To make matters worse, John Crocker and Bill Yetman were injured during the trip and unable to compete in the final few games.\nWith the season spiraling out of control, coach Chase reshuffled the lines, moving Shawn McKean to the top unit with Dave Key and Wally Sears. With Dick Greeley holding the back end with the rest of the defensive corps, the offense stepped to the fore and helped Harvard arrest its slide by scoring 28 goals over two a two-game stretch. After an extended layoff, the scoring continued at a high pace in early February and nearly enabled the Crimson to reach .500.\nWhile the team's 6-game losing streak meant that it would be nearly impossible for the Crimson to earn an NCAA tournament bid, the team could still play spoiler for other hopefuls as it sought to finish out she season strong. Unfortunately, Harvard had not been able to fully resolve its defensive issues and lost three consecutive games, all while averaging 5 goals themselves. After brief interlude when they defeated Williams, Harvard lost another trio of games and sat dead last in the Pentagonal League standings.\nThe team's final home stand in March saw the defense stiffen and hold Princeton to 2 goals. The following game, which was initially slated to be the last of the season, provided the Crimson with a 1–0 victory over Yale, the team's only shutout on the season. Because the season series with the Elis was a draw, a final rubber match between the two was added and took place the following week. The game turned out to be more of a brawl than a hockey game with both teams complaining about the lack of officiating. While Yale was the better team on the ice, tempers were running high all night and several fights broke out between the two teams. With just 75 seconds remaining in the match, Dave Abbott and Artie Moher got into a confrontation in front of the Yale cage. After being told to go to their respective locker rooms, the two reengaged and Abbott was hit in the mouth Moher's stick. He had to be taken to the local hospital where he received 12 stitches. In order to prevent further chaos, coach Chase pulled his players off of the ice and ended the game prematurely. While it was unclear at the time as to whether or not the game would be ruled a forfeit, eventually the final score was allowed to stand at 10–3 for Yale.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n&lt;br&gt;"

Under the rules in effect at the time, three races in the discipline were required to award a crystal globe to the discipline champion (and, in a change, fewer than three races might still be sufficient, after no crystal globes were handed out in the discipline for the three previous seasons). The declining popularity of combined skiing (reflected in the small number of events the past three years) led the three combined races scheduled for 2016 to be run under three different formats. The first race, at Wengen, was run as a traditional super-combined (downhill followed by slalom); the second race, at Kitzbühel, was run as a traditional Alpine combined (Super-G followed by slalom); and the third race, at Chamonix, was run as an inverted super-combined (slalom followed by downhill).\nAlexis Pinturault of France had been co-champion in two of the previous three seasons where too few races had been held for the discipline champion to be awarded a crystal globe and runner-up, 2013-14 in the other (2015). However, with three races back on the schedule in 2016, Pintaurault won the last two of them to claim the crystal globe for the season.\nAt this time, combined races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2016 in St. Moritz, Switzerland."

He played for UIC Flames men's basketball from 1990 to 1994 in the Mid-Continent Conference (now Summit League), earning MCC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1994. He played high school basketball at Lyons Township High School. After college, he played in several international leagues, highlighted by a 1999 Polish Basketball League All-Star game appearance.\nHigh school.\nAt Lyons High School, Kenny Williams played point guard. He shared the backcourt with John Hornacek, brother of Jeff Hornacek. His 1988–89 junior season Lyons team was mediocre (11-12, 4–6) on February 12. His senior season team commenced with a 9–1 start. He was a 1990 Chicagoland All-area selection by the \"Chicago Tribune\", who received one third-place vote in the Illinois Mr. Basketball voting. He committed to the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) in March 1990 after leading Lyons to the West Suburban Silver conference championship.\nCollege.\nOn January 22, 1994, Williams became the all-time leading scorer at UIC, surpassing Chuck Lambert totals from his 1971–75 tenure with the team. He was the 1994 Summit League Men's Basketball Player of the Year as well as both a three-time All-Mid-Continent Conference (MCC, now Summit League) First Team selection and a three-time MCC All-Tournament selection (both 1992–1994). For each of his All-conference and All-conference tournament seasons, the Flames finished as runner up in the conference tournament and did not play in any postseason tournaments. Williams was the first UIC Flame to record 2000 career points (2,025) and is the All-time Flames leader in steals with 237. During his junior season, he was second in the MCC in scoring to Bill Edwards (25.2–21.7). As a senior he led the MCC in assists (4.6) and steals (2.5), while trailing only teammate Sherrell Ford in scoring (24.3–21.5).

He became the third Flame (Ford and Mark Miller) to have his number retired on February 19, 2016.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduation, Williams tried out for the Chicago Rockers of the Continental Basketball Association, but a wrist injury hampered his 1994 training camp and he was released.\nIn 1997, Williams initially signed in Spain but later played two games with Trefl Sopot in Poland. He finished the 1997–98 season in Portugal with Porto. In December 1998, Williams re-joined Trefl Sopot and averaged 24.2 points in 22 games. In January 1999, he had a game with 54 points and 14 3-pointers, which set a Polish Basketball League record.

        "title": "2008–09 Boston University Terriers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2008–09 Boston University Terriers Men's ice hockey season was the 81st season of play for the program and 25th in Hockey East. They represented Boston University in the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The Terriers were coached by Jack Parker, in his 36th season, and played their home games at Agganis Arena. The team won the 2009 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 5th national championship in program history.\nSeason.\nEntering the year, Boston University had been a program in limbo for several years. While Jack Parker had no trouble recruiting talented players for the Terriers (nearly half of the roster was made up of NHL-drafted players), that hadn't translated into many victories for BU. Over the previous four years, the Terriers had good finishes in the regular season but had squandered several tournament appearance by losing 3 of their last 4 postseason games.\nThis year, the team's fortunes would hinge on the performance of two freshmen goaltenders, Kieran Millan and Grant Rollheiser, who would vie to take over the starting from the less-than stellar Brett Bennett. At the beginning of the year, the two netminders shared the crease and both played well over the first few weeks of the campaign. By late-November, however, Millan had established himself as the better of the two and would remain a fixture in goal for the rest of the season. Rollheiser got some playing time and did look very capable when he was in the cage, but Millan put up one of the most stellar freshman performances in the history of the NCAA.\nBU's goaltenders were insulated by a star-studded cast of defensemen, many of whom would reach the highest level of the game, including Eric Gryba, Brian Strait and Kevin Shattenkirk. It was, however, Matt Gilroy, the team's senior co-Captain who led the defensive corps. While Gilroy led the club in points from the blueline, he was also a standout by wearing the number 97. Jack Parker typically did not allow his players to wear any number above 39, however, Gilroy was a special case. Growing up, Matt and his younger brother Timmy wore numbers 98 and 97 respectively in honor of Wayne Gretzky. That changed when Timmy died in a bicycle accident at the age of 8. Afterwards, Matt Gilroy wore his brother's number and when he told Parker his reasons why, the old-school BU coach made an exception for Gilroy.\nUp front, the Terriers were a very deep team. Led by a 7th-overall pick in Colin Wilson, the Terriers had the #1 offense in the nation. BU had 17 players reach double-digit points on the year and averaged just under 4 goals per game. With all of those elements, the Terriers produced one of the best single-season performances in college hockey.\nEarly season gauntlet.\nFrom the beginning of their campaign, the Terriers faced a difficult test. In their first eleven games, nine came against ranked teams. Despite the tall task, BU shot out to a 6–1 record and were ranked #1 just a month into the season. The team hit a bit of a rough patch in mid-November and lost three of four games. They dropped down to #8 in the polls but jumped back into the top 5 when they took a weekend series from arch-rival and then-#2 Boston College.\nPiling up wins.\nAfter returning from the winter break, BU kicked off the second half of their season by winning the Denver Cup. After a poor performance against conference bottom-feeder Providence ten days later, BU went on a long streak and didn't lose another game for the rest of the regular season. The Terriers went 13–0–3 down the stretch and trounced most of their opponents. During their run, they also captured the Beanpot title, dropping #3 Northeastern in the process. By not losing, BU was able to rise up to #1 in the polls and finish atop the Hockey East standings by a single point.\nConference tournament.\nDespite being the prohibitive favorite for the NCAA title, BU faced tough challenge from 8th-seeded Maine in the quarterfinals. After eking out a narrow victory in game 1, the Terriers played one of their worst games of the year in the rematch and lost for the first time in over two months. Millan's 6 goals against was by far a season high and put the Terriers on the precipice of getting knocked out of the Hockey East tournament. The shocking loss appeared to wake up the team and they came storming back in the deciding game 3, scoring 6 goals in the first two periods and sailing to an easy victory.\nThe semifinal pitted BU against BC once more and, at least early-on, it appeared that the Eagles may finally have figured out how to defeat this year's team. The Terriers were held scoreless over the first 50 minutes of the game and were held in check by a stingy Boston College defense. In the second half of the third, BU's offense exploded for 3 goals in 44 seconds and took a 3–1 lead over the stunned BC squad. The Eagles were able to cut into the lead with a second goal just after a BU penalty had expired but Millan held the fort for the rest of the game and allowed the Terriers to escape with a win.\nThe championship game turned into a goaltending dual between Millan and Massachusetts–Lowell's Nevin Hamilton. It took almost all of the first period for Brandon Yip to net the Terriers' first marker but that was all BU could get past the River Hawk goalie. Fortunately, Millan stood on his head all game long and turned aside all 32 shots to earn a 1–0 shutout and the 31st victory on the year for the Terriers.\nNCAA tournament.\nBU was given the #1 overall seed for the NCAA tournament, which was typically the kiss-of-death for a team's championship hopes. Since 1996, only Wisconsin in 2006 had won a championship as the top overall seed. While history may have been against them, The Terriers were able to open against a relatively weak Ohio State team and complete dominate the Buckeyes. BU scored the first six goals of the game and were able to relax in the second half, cruising to an 8–3 victory. They received goals from six different players but it was Matt Gilroy who led the way with 4 assists.\nThe Terriers' road grew much more difficult after the opening round breeze and they got a fight from conference-rival New Hampshire. The Wildcats limited BU to just 23 shots on the night but that didn't stop Corey Trivino from opening the scoring. UNH took over the second period and even the score but, uncharacteristically, it was the Wildcats that got into penalty trouble in the third. Jason Lawrence scored his 24th goal of the year on BU's second power play of the frame with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation to give the Terriers the win and send them to the Frozen Four for the first time in twelve years.\nIn the national semifinal against another conference rival, Vermont, BU got off to a tremendous start; they outshot the Catamounts 2:1 and led 2–0 after 20 minutes. While it appeared that the Terriers were on their way to another easy win, Vermont came charging back in the second, scoring three consecutive goals in a 6-minute span to take the lead. Vinny Saponari netter a power play goal just before the end of the period to tie the game. The Catamounts retook the lead mid-way through the third on their second power play goal of the game but Chris Higgins became the hero a few minutes later. He scored his 14th of the year on a rush to tie the game and then had Wilson score off of his rebound to put the Terriers ahead for good.\nAfter the wild semifinal, only Miami remained and Boston University met the RedHawks for the championship. Chris Connolly opened the scoring in the first, however, true to form, the Terriers were hampered by having to kill 7 penalties during the game. While Miami wasn't able to score on any of the man-advantages, they were able to keep the Terriers hemmed in their zone for much of the time. The limited offensive opportunities enabled the RedHawks to tie the game in the second and then take a lead in the second half of the third. A third Miami goal with just over 4 minutes remaining in the match appeared to be the final nail in the coffin for BU. After calling a timeout, Parker pulled Kieran Millan with 3:32 remaining. Due to the tough defensing from Miami, it took a while for BU to establish themselves in the offensive zone but eventually they were able to leaky goal from a Zach Cohen backhander. With approximately one minute left, BU needed another goal to tie and the team appeared to be far more energetic. The Terriers were able to get into the Miami end fairly easily and passed the puck around with aplomb. Eventually the rubber made its way through a sea of lumber and legs to the stick of Nick Bonino who fired it into a half-open cage to tie the score with just 17 seconds remaining. The team's momentum carried over into the overtime where BU outshot Miami 9–4. About halfway through the extra period, Colby Cohen fired a shot from the blueline but it was blocked by Kevin Roeder. The puck deflected off of Roeder's leg up into the air, causing Miami's goaltender Cody Reichard to lose track of the shot. The puck arched like a rainbow right over Reichard's shoulder and into the net, giving BU its 5th national championship and one of the more improbable comebacks in the history of all sports, let alone college hockey.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Wyoming's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.

Unfortunately, in the very next downhill race a week later, at the \"Streif\" downhill run in Kitzbühel (where Svindal had won a Super-G two days before), Svindal crashed and suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear in his right knee, ending his season. Because of poor visibility and dangerous winds, which already had led the course to be shortened before the race even started, the \"Streif\" downhill was stopped after just 30 skiers, the minimum number for the race to be deemed official -- but it already had produced three serious crashes among the best downhillers in the world. \nHowever, the surprise winner on the \"Streif\" was Peter Fill of Italy, who had started the day 245 points behind Svindal but picked up 100 for the win. After four more downhills, and heading into the finals, Fill and Svindal were tied on points (436) with Italy's Dominik Paris only four points behind. In the finals at St. Moritz, although both skied cautiously, Fill placed tenth, scoring 26 points, but Paris finished nineteenth and failed to score any points (as only the top 15 score at the finals), thus allowing Fill to become the first ever Italian man to win the downhill crystal globe."

However, two days after winning the Super-G in Kitzbühel, Svindal (along with Austria's Georg Streitberger) suffered a season-ending injury in a downhill there. That opened up the race for the discipline title, which then became a wide-open battle that also included 23-year-old Norwegian skier Aleksander Aamodt Kilde. After Jansrud won the next-to-last Super-G of the season in Kvitfjell, Kilde had a five-point lead on the inactive Svindal, a 37-point lead on Austria's Vincent Kriechmayr, and a 40-point lead over Jansrud. In the finals, Kilde and Jansrud tied for second, earning each 80 points and giving the crystal globe to Kilde (extending Norway's dominance to five seasons) as part of an all-Norwegian podium with Jansrud and Svindal."

Live.\nIt is the largest outdoor 3-on-3 tournament in California, with over 1,500 teams, 5,000 players, and 25,000 spectators attending the event every year, and was first started in 2008. In 2018 and 2017, the winners of the elite division for men and women were able to participate in the official 2018 and 2019 USA Basketball 3×3 National Tournament, and were able to win $20,000 in prize money and advances to the FIBA 3X3 World Tour Nanjing Masters in China. Ryan Golden, Commissioner of the Nike Basketball 3ON3 Tournament said “We’re thrilled that our tournament continues to attract talent throughout the country in addition to the attention of FIBA, who this year, designated the men’s Nike Elite Division an official FIBA 3X3 Satellite Tournament,” and, “It’s an exciting time for 3x3 basketball, and even more so to realize that players from our tournament could potentially represent the USA in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.”\nThe tournament was however cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with COVID-19 social gathering guidelines.\nTeams.\nThe event hosts 6 different groups divided based on age and talent, and teams within the same group will compete against each other. The 6 groups are youth (ages 8-9 and 10-12, with a fee of $200), teen (ages 13-19, with a fee of $220), adult (ages 20 and over with a fee of $220), adult elite (ages 18 and over, with a fee of $260), wheelchair, and special Olympics (All-ages and no fee).\nPrizes.\nThe champion team of each group's bracket wins an award t-shirt, and a medal. The runner-ups for each bracket will also win a t-shirt. In 2019, Nike partnered with Bennett Awards to create a custom Nike 3ON3 Basketball trophy for the winning teams in each elite bracket that year.\nSponsors and partners.\nNike 3ON3 Basketball is sponsored by Nike Basketball, Big 5 Sporting Goods, Spartan, and is partnered with L.A. Live. They partnered with Bennett Awards in 2019 to create a custom trophy for the 2019 Nike 3ON3 Tournament winners, and Dash Radio for the 2018 Nike 3ON3 Basketball Tournament to help host the Nike 3ON3 Celebrity Basketball Game. In the past, they have also partnered with Powerade, Toyota, and Bodybuilding.com.\nFundraising.\nIn 2012, 2013, and 2014, Nike hosted the Josh Hutcherson Celebrity Basketball Game benefitting the Straight But Not Narrow Foundation. In 2016 and 2017, that year partnering with REAL 92.3, Nike hosted the ESPN LA 710AM All-Star Celebrity Game with their 3ON3 tournament, and all proceeds from that event went to the Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund at The V Foundation.\nExtra events.\nDuring the 3ON3 Tournament, Nike also hosts several events.

        "title": "LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "There are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy.\nLGBT fans.\nPublic displays of affection.\nAs early as 2010, concerns had been raised about the rights of members of the LGBT community who would attend the tournament, since homosexuality was illegal in Qatar. After Qatar was chosen as host, Sepp Blatter, the then-president of FIFA, was criticised for apparently jokingly telling a reporter inquiring about these concerns that gay attendees \"should refrain from any sexual activities\". While apologizing for that statement, Blatter assured that FIFA did not tolerate discrimination, and stated that \"[FIFA] don't want any discrimination. What we want to do is open this game to everybody, and to open it to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022.\"\nThe Human Rights Watch reported that Qatar had arbitrarily arrested LGBT people and subjected them to ill-treatment in detention. The \"Gay Times\" reported that while Muslims can be sentenced to death for homosexuality under Sharia law, there have been no known cases of the death penalty being enforced for homosexuality in Qatar.\nIn 2013, Hassan al-Thawadi stated that everyone would be welcome at Qatar 2022, but warned against public displays of affection because they were \"not part of our culture and tradition\". The Qatar organising committee seemed to retract this in September 2022, when Football Association (the FA; England's federation) chief executive Mark Bullingham said there had been assurances that LGBT couples would not face arrest while holding hands or kissing in public in Qatar. However, shortly before the tournament commenced, former Qatar international player and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman described homosexuality as a \"damage in the mind\" in an interview with German broadcaster ZDF, which led to further criticism, including from the German government. The interview was cut short following the comments; Salman later said that his comments had been misrepresented by news agencies.\nRumours of homosexuality medical test.\nAfter rumours and allegations that Qatar would introduce medical screening tests to detect and ban homosexuals from entering the country, LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell said that \"FIFA now has no option but to cancel the World Cup in Qatar\". However, no such screening test exists. It was later revealed that this proposal came from Kuwait and, while involving other nearby nations, did not involve Qatar.\nFIFA defence and legacy in football.\nIn a news conference on the day before the opening match, confronting renewed criticisms that LGBT+ fans felt unsafe, FIFA president Gianni Infantino continued to defend that \"everyone who comes to Qatar is welcome, whatever religion, race, sexual orientation, belief she or he has, everyone is welcome. This was our requirement and the Qatari state sticks to that requirement\", and argued that anti-LGBT laws \"exist in many countries in the world\", and \"existed in Switzerland [where FIFA is based and Infantino was raised] when they organised the World Cup in 1954.\"\nThe BBC published a report based on interviews with LGBT+ fans from Qatar and from Western nations in December 2022. It looked at the effect that the attitude of the organising committee and FIFA (particularly Infantino) towards LGBT+ rights in preparation for and during the World Cup had on fans' feelings and views of football culture and homosexuality in football. Many fans reflected that they had previously felt that the footballing world was at or approaching a positive and supportive place in terms of accepting LGBT+ fans and players. The British attitude noted in the BBC report was that fans considered LGBT+ people being treated equally to be an uncontroversial matter of fact, and a fundamental human right, with fans having become used to seeing overt support from the footballing world. By instead seeing FIFA allow LGBT+ rights to revert to a debate, and one based on culture rather than human rights, during the World Cup, these fans were shocked; the BBC also noted that there was shock at Infantino repeatedly saying that people who wanted FIFA to condemn Qatar's stance on LGBT+ rights were only trying to stir a culture war.\nIt concluded that the legacy of the Qatar World Cup would be to set back LGBT+ acceptance in football, discouraging LGBT+ fans from feeling that they have a place. The attitude of FIFA, suggesting that it will not support LGBT+ rights as \"divisive\", was said by the report to make football seem more hostile to LGBT+ players; it quoted Finnish women's footballer Linda Sällström ironically asking what FIFA would do to the numerous openly gay female players set to compete at the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup if an armband with implicit awareness of homosexuality had been enough to warrant punishment in 2022.\nPromotion of LGBT rights in Qatar.\nIn January 2022, openly gay Australian footballer Josh Cavallo suggested he would support the World Cup happening in Qatar if it could cause laws to be changed, describing this possibility as \"a fantastic opportunity\" for the nation, having previously expressed fear of travelling to the nation before the organising committee told him he would be welcome.\nIn October 2022, Human Rights Watch called on FIFA to press Qatar to launch reforms that protected LGBT people after a Qatari official denied that there were cases of LGBT people beaten in jail. Qatari officials also rejected allegations that there were conversion therapy centers in Qatar.\nThe openly queer BBC Sport television pundit Alex Scott reported throughout the World Cup in Qatar, saying ahead of the opening match that there were people who had suggested she stay at home, but she had instead wanted to use the platform of being at the World Cup to highlight and address the issues, which she did on several occasions.\nJoe Lycett stunt.\nOn 13 November 2022, a week before the tournament was due to kick off, British comedian Joe Lycett released a video criticising David Beckham for his lucrative sponsorship deal promoting the World Cup, due to the country's stance on LGBT rights. In the video, Lycett promised to give £10,000 to charities that support queer people in football if Beckham pulled out of the deal. If Beckham did not pull out of the deal, he said he would shred the money during a livestream on 20 November, just before the opening ceremony. After the deadline passed with no response from Beckham or his representatives, Lycett broadcast such a livestream; it was later revealed that this was a ruse, with Lycett saying that he had donated the money to charity, having had no intention from the start of destroying money.\nTeam apparel.\nOneLove armband.\nSeveral European captains – those of England, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands – were planning to wear OneLove armbands, which feature a multi-colored design and the phrase \"OneLove\". This was intended \"to promote inclusion and send a message against discrimination of any kind\". Widely seen as tacit support of the LGBTQ+ community, some felt it targeted Qatar's anti-LGBT laws. FIFA, who impose a fine on teams who wear unofficial armband designs at the World Cup, did not immediately comment on the issue. On 21 November, after the tournament had started but before any of the European nations had played, however, the relevant football associations were told the players would receive yellow cards if they wore the armband. It was later revealed by the Danish Football Association (DBU) that FIFA had not planned to tell the European teams of the potential punishment for wearing the OneLove armband; that the FA called FIFA to their team hotel for an emergency meeting on 21 November, the day of England's first match; and that at this meeting FIFA told the collected teams that a yellow card would be the \"minimum\" punishment for wearing the armbands, with other possibilities including banning the captains altogether.\nFIFA were criticised by fans and the football associations for forcing captains to choose between representing their countries and using their voice, with the Pride in Football LGBTQ+ supporters group also criticising the players for not doing so anyway, saying: \"A token gesture from the start that has turned into another embarrassment from FIFA. FIFA have had since September to sort this, and yet they wait until now to threaten sanction. Fifa is denying players their fundamental and most basic human right to freedom of speech. Countries, teams and players are happy to defend LGBTQ+ people until they themselves are at risk. LGBTQ+ Qataris face a bigger punishment than just a yellow card. The gestures and the activism ended quite easily at the thought of reprimand.\"\nThere were multiple incidents relating to LGBT symbols in Group B matches, with the United Kingdom and United States (England, Wales, and the US were all in Group B) governments also criticising FIFA for introducing player punishment for the armbands. Later in the week, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney criticised the world football governing body in his country's parliament, describing it as \"absolutely extraordinary\" that FIFA not only took the decision to ban the armbands, but kept changing their reason as to why, including shifting the blame by saying it was because of other national teams. Coveney also said: \"That is a political intervention by FIFA to limit freedom of expression, which is worthy of significant mention and criticism.\" In the media, British newspaper \"Metro\" changed its website logo to a rainbow to protest the FIFA decision. Alex Scott wore the armband pitch-side before the England vs Iran match. Scott had earlier (during the opening ceremony, which the BBC elected not to broadcast, holding a studio panel discussion of Qatar controversies instead) criticised Infantino for a rambling speech in which he, in a seeming attempt to downplay the controversies of the tournament, claimed he understood what gay people in Qatar (among other minorities) felt like because he had experienced discrimination before.\nOn 22 November, the German Football Association (DFB) announced that they were taking legal action against FIFA for the decision, submitting a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The German team played their first match the next day, and covered their mouths with their hands during their team photo as a protest against FIFA, signalling that they had been silenced. Qatari television hosts later mimicked the gesture when Germany were eliminated from the World Cup in the group stage, seen to be mocking the campaign. The FA, England football's governing body, also announced they were exploring legal options, saying that it understands World Cup rules would only administer a fine for kit violations and that FIFA may be attempting to enforce IFAB rules, which could allow them to implement other sanctions and which England believe should not apply to the World Cup, instead.\nOn 23 November, the DBU, as well as revealing FIFA's threat of significant player punishment, confirmed that they and other UEFA teams were discussing a blanket withdrawal from FIFA, and said that they would not support the reelection of Infantino as FIFA president while they were still members. On the same day, a Danish TV 2 reporter wearing a OneLove armband while broadcasting from outside a stadium was approached by security officials, who told him to remove the armband and tried to block the camera.\nFans began buying OneLove armbands after the ban and according to Badge Direct, who produce the armbands, they were sold out by 24 November. In response, FIFA allowed teams to wear the official \"no discrimination\" armbands intended for the quarter-finals during the group stage.\nOther team items.\nOn 21 November, FIFA rejected Belgium's away jerseys due to the word \"Love\" being on the inside of the collar, even though it was unrelated to any campaign supporting LGBT rights.\nThe United States included a rainbow in their team branding, replacing the red stripes in their logo with differently-coloured ones to create a Pride rainbow, but only used this for facilities used by the team, not on their jerseys. The Football Association of Wales said they would not withdraw from FIFA over the armband ban, but were otherwise heavily critical and put up rainbow flags at their outdoor training grounds in protest.\nRainbow flag confiscations.\nOn several occasions the Qatari organisers promised to comply with FIFA rules on promoting tolerance, including LGBT issues. In December 2020, Nasser Al-Khater, the Qatar World Cup chief executive, assured that, in accordance with FIFA's inclusion policy, it would not restrict the display of pro-LGBT imagery and symbols (such as rainbow flags) at matches during the World Cup, saying: \"When it comes to the rainbow flags in the stadiums, FIFA have their own guidelines, they have their rules and regulations, whatever they may be, we will respect them.\"\nHowever, in April 2022, a senior security official overseeing the tournament stated that there were plans to confiscate pride flags from spectators, claiming it to be a safety measure to protect the fans from altercations with spectators that are anti-LGBT. Fare network criticised the report, arguing that actions against the LGBT community by the state were of a greater concern to those attending the World Cup than the actions of individuals.\nA Brazilian journalist had his phone seized by authorities when people mistook a flag representing his state, Pernambuco, which includes a rainbow within a larger design, for an LGBT flag. Other Brazilian fans from the region reported similar incidents of having flags taken from them because of the rainbow.\nOther rainbow apparel.\nGroup B.\nUS journalist Grant Wahl was detained for half an hour, before the United States' opener against Wales. He was wearing a black shirt with a rainbow on the front. He was told his shirt was not allowed due to it being \"political\". After 25 minutes, a security commander allowed him into the venue and apologised, and he also received an apology from a representative of FIFA. Wahl later passed away from an aortic rupture secondary to an aortic aneurysm on 10 December while reporting on a match in Qatar.\nFemale Wales fans and Football Association of Wales (FAW) staff (including former Wales women's football captain Laura McAllister) had rainbow bucket hats, produced by the FAW, confiscated at the same game. The FAW said they were \"extremely disappointed\" and they would be raising the incidents with FIFA the following day; FIFA subsequently opened talks about rainbow apparel with Qatari officials on 22 November.\nAccording to BBC reporter Natalie Perks, she and a cameraman were prevented from entering Al Bayt Stadium ahead of the England vs United States Group B game on 25 November because the cameraman was found to have a rainbow-decorated watch and strap in his possession, which had been gifted to him by his son. Perks said they were eventually permitted entry to the stadium after dialling a number aimed specifically at media personnel to help them if they encountered difficulties. According to \"The Guardian\", a reporter for \"The Times\" newspaper was questioned at the same stadium around the same game because of a wristband they were wearing.\nOther matches.\nDespite FIFA reassuring fans that rainbow coloured apparel would be allowed inside the stadium after the Group B incidents, Qatari officials continued to confiscate rainbow-coloured items from several fans.\nOne fan attending a Group A final round game involving the Dutch national team on 29 November claimed to have had a security guard scream in his face, was forced to take off a multi-coloured baseball cap he was wearing and then was forced to strip his clothes, including his underwear. He then said his cap disappeared and security staff claimed he wasn't wearing it at all, only for it to emerge from behind a scanner. Then, when his ticket was being checked he was told to stand in the corner, where he was surrounded by seven people, four of whom were police and one of whom was wearing a FIFA uniform, where further threats were made.\nIn a match between Portugal and Uruguay, in which Uruguay lost 2–0, a protestor invaded the pitch, waving a rainbow flag.\nHomophobic football chants.\nA perennial issue in the sport in some countries, homophobic football chants were reported to be heard at the first matches involving Mexico and Ecuador, particularly from Ecuador fans towards Chile and the Qatar team during the tournament's opening match, with FIFA opening hearings to determine disciplinary action. Mexico was subject of a second disciplinary measure by FIFA after the final group stage match against Saudi Arabia because of homophobic chants during the course of the game."

That event was initially held at Litchfield, Staffordshire. From the mid-1880s to 1890s the tournament was known as the Staffordshire Lawn Tennis Tournament. In 1893 the Staffordshire Lawn tennis Association was formed. By the early 1920s it had become a county level event that ran until 1984.\nHistory.\nIn July 1878 the Staffordshire County Cricket Club Lawn Tennis Tournament was held for the first time at the Staffordshire County Cricket Club grounds, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England. In 1886 the tournament moved to Coton Hall Institution grounds in Stafford, where it was renamed as the Staffordshire Lawn Tennis Tournament.\nIn 1920 the event was officially elevated to county level status and called the Staffordshire County Lawn Lennis Championships. In 1930 it changed venue to the Wolverhampton Lawn Tennis Club (f.1885). The championships were staged as an open international tour event until the late 1960s before being downgraded from the annual circuit. It was held up until at least 1984 as local county championships As of 2019 the Staffordshire Championships were still being staged."

The Red Raiders represented the Colgate University and were coached by J. Howard Starr, in his 13th season.\nSeason.\nAt the start of the season, Colgate had to contend with the loss of its star goaltender as Mark Galloway accepted an invitation to try out for the US national team for the 1948 Olympics while on academic probation. While he was ultimately left off of the team, understudy Bill Taylor had to substitute in for the team's season-opening trip up to Buffalo. The three-game series began with Colgate losing to Princeton, snapping a 16-game winning streak for the Raiders. The second game was against Dartmouth, widely regarded as the best team in the country. Colgate had an addition problem as goaltending equipment failed to arrive in time and necessitated Lou Reycroft taking a turn in goal. Despite the problems, Colgate put forth a credible performance and kept the game close until the final period. The team reversed the trend in the final game of the trip and downed Williams 5–0.\nThough Galloway may have missed out, Tommy Dockrell and Bruce Gardner were both invited to join the AAU team that travelled to St. Moritz. They would miss several games for the Red Raiders, however, the travelling was all for naught as the AAU squad would not be allowed to participate as there was a conflict with the AHA team. In the meantime, Colgate won games over three other New York schools and put themselves into position for a possible, if unlikely, NCAA tournament bid.\nAfter returning from the exam break, Colgate lost the services of Herb Muther to graduation but saw Dockrell and Gardner return while Galloway was off of probation and now eligible to play once more. Colgate evened the season series with Princeton, however, they had the same trick inflicted upon them by Clarkson. After the loss, Colgate headed over to Ithaca and swamped Cornell, perhaps venting some of their frustration on the hapless Reds. After defeating Norwich in the final game of the regular season, Colgate was invited to participate at the AAU tournament in Buffalo. The Raiders ended up defeating three amateur clubs over a 25-hour span to win the championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | National AAU Tournament\n&lt;br&gt;\nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

It called for the Russian-led International Boxing Association to disclose its financial dealings with Russian energy giant Gazprom, determine the detrimental effects of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and for IBA to take stronger action against the Russian Boxing Federation.\nIn May 2022, Dutch official Boris van der Vorst, who heads the group was ruled ineligible to challenge incumbent IBA president and Russian official Umar Kremlev in an election. In September 2022, an extraordinary IBA congress decided against holding any new election, this allowing Kremlev to retain the presidency. By December 2022, the membership of the Common Cause Alliance has grown to 25 federations.\nFormation of World Boxing.\nWorld Boxing was launched in April 2023 with its interim board including officials from member organizations of the Common Cause Alliance."

        "title": "Jim O'Brien (rugby league, born 1896)",
        "text": "James Lawrence O'Brien (2 August 1896 – 6 April 1988) was a New Zealand rugby league player. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in 1 match in 1925 against Queensland. In the process he became the 182nd player to represent New Zealand. He also represented Auckland 20 times from 1922 to 1927, and the North Island side in 1927. He played his club rugby league in Auckland for the North Shore Albions (who at this time were named Devonport United) from 1921 to 1928, captaining them at times later in his career. He played for the Maritime club in 1920 and 1921 in his early years after returning from World War 1.\nEarly life.\nJames (Jim) Lawrence O’Brien was born on 2 August 1896, in Stillwater, Grey, on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. His parents were Catherine (Kate) O'Brien (née Hughes) (1856–1908), and James O'Brien (1859–1927). Kate was born in Kilmore, Dublin, Ireland, while James was born in Tipperary, Ireland. He had 4 sisters; Elizabeth Mary O’Brien (1887–), Johanna Theresa O’Brien (1890–), Margaret O’Brien (1891–), and Mary Kathleen O’Brien (1894), and 2 brothers; John Terence O’Brien (1897–1975), and Patrick William O’Brien (1900–1983). His mother died in 1908 in Stillwater aged 52 when Jim was 12 years old. His father died in 1927 in Brunner, West Coast aged 68.\nWorld War 1.\nIn 1915 O’Brien enlisted in the World War 1 effort. It appears as though he falsified his age as he was only turning 19 in this year which was too young to be eligible. On his enlistment papers it was stated that his date of birth was 2 August 1894. At the time he was a sheep farmer and living at \"Sea Homestead\". His fathers address was the Liverpool Collieries, Rewanui, on the West Coast. It was the Liverpool State Coalmine which had opened in 1889 and was closed in 1994. His sister, Mrs. H. Day, was listed as his next of kin and was living at 17 Milton Street in Nelson.\nDistinguished Conduct Medal.\nHe commenced duties on 13 December 1915. O'Brien was part of the 11th Reinforcements in J Company as a Private but was later promoted to Sergeant serving in the Auckland Infantry Regiment in the 2nd battalion. He fought in Egypt in 1916 and Western Europe in 1916–18. O'Brien was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. In the London Gazette on May 30, 1919, it was written that it was awarded \"for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has fought in every action but one in which the battalion has been engaged. He distinguished himself at Grevillers and Bancourt in August, 1918, by the cool handling of his section and his gallantry under heavy fire. One 10th October, in the advance of the River Selle, he was again noticed for his excellent work\". He served overseas for 3 years and 60 days with his total service 3 years and 179 days. He was also awarded the British War Medal, and Victory Medal. In an extract from the fifth supplement to the London Gazette on the same date it was also stated that \"His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal to the undermentioned Non-Commissioned Officer for gallantry and distinguished service in the field ... 10250 Sergt. J.L. O'Brien, Auck. Inf. Battln.\".\nAfter the war he was due to arrive back into Wellington, New Zealand on 27 May 1919 on the troopship S.S. Pakeha, but ultimately arrived on 30 May. He was discharged on 27 June 1919. After returning to New Zealand he moved to Auckland and took up residence at 12 Rutland Rd, in Devonport, on the North Shore of Auckland.\nPlaying career.\nRugby league for Maritime.\nJim O'Brien began his rugby league career playing for the Maritime club in Auckland Rugby League in 1920. His debut was on 17 April against Otahuhu Rovers in a practice match. He did not play in their opening game on 8 May but made his first appearance in an official competition match a week later against Marist Old Boys at Victoria Park. They won 16 to 11 and the Auckland Star said \"Arndt, Herring and O’Brien did good work for the pack\". He played in 8 further matches before scoring his first try. Maritime had \"worked the ball to the City line, where from a scrum O'Brien obtained possession and struggled over the line\" to give Maritime a 15–8 lead with them holding on to win 15–11. The following week they defeated Ponsonby United to win the championship. It is unclear if he played in Maritime's remaining 4 matches but it is likely that he played in at least 3 of them.\nTransfer to Devonport United.\nIn 1921 O’Brien was elected on to the Maritime committee. He only played in 3 matches for Maritime out of their first 5, not being selected to start in games against Newton Rangers on 14 May, or Ponsonby United on 28 May.\nOn 25 June O'Brien was surprisingly listed in the Devonport United squad for their match against Newton. There had been no reports in any of the newspapers of his transfer which was normally the case. The match was postponed. He made his senior debut for Devonport United on 2 July in a loss to Ponsonby 18–11. It was then reported that he was being \"reinstated as a member of the North Shore club\" implying that he had played there initially after returning from the war, most likely in a junior side.\nIn 1923 O'Brien began the season in Devonport's second grade team with his brother Terence playing in their 3rd grade side. Teams were typically listed in the Friday edition of the Auckland newspapers in their approximate playing order with the first thirteen named being the starting side. O'Brien was listed from 14 to 18 most weeks and was not mentioned in any match reports so it is unlikely he played until their round 10 match on 15 July when they defeated Fire Brigade 21–7. He was named in a match report as playing a \"great game\" along with Alf Scott, Harry Douglas, Neville St George, and Wheeler. O’Brien was involved in a try on 5 August against Athletic in an 11–9 loss. It is possible that he played in additional matches though he was not named in any other match reports.\nAuckland debut.\nAt the end of the 1922 season Auckland traveled to Bay Of Plenty to play the fledgling Bay of Plenty side that George Iles had been instrumental in starting. O’Brien was chosen in the second row alongside W Hanlon, with Devonport teammate Harry Douglas at lock. Early in the match when Australian boxer Mike Flynn had made a break \"Somers and O'Brien further improved, and Johnson joining issue the last mentioned swept over to open the visitors’ score\". Auckland went on to win the match by 33 points to 26 at the Tauranga Domain.\nO'Brien became established in the Devonport side in 1923 when he played in 12 matches and scored 3 tries. After their first match with Athletic on 5 May the New Zealand Herald said that \"O'Brien and St George were very busy among the forwards\". In round 4 he scored a \"fine try\" in a 12–3 win over Richmond Rovers at the Devonport Domain. He \"secured from the loose and scored a brilliant try\". In their round 6 loss to Ponsonby United he was \"the pick of the forwards\" along with Johnston and Harry Douglas. He scored a week later in another loss, this time to Marist Old Boys by 18–13 at the Devonport Domain. His try came after he \"made the best of an opportunity and dribbled over, falling on the ball, giving Devonport their initial try\". He \"shone in the attacking\" along with St George and Douglas. He \"showed up well\" in the forwards in 14–8 loss to Athletic at Carlaw Park on 30 June. The following week against City Rovers he scored a try in a 13–10 win when he followed a break by Garrett and \"took the ball on [and] beat the opposition, and scored between the posts\". He was again \"the pick of the forwards\" with Douglas and Johnstone where they were \"prominent in all the good work\". He played in a match with Richmond before not being listed in the side in their round 11 and 12 matches before returning for round 14. In their round 1 Roope Rooster final win over Athletic by 21 to 16 he was \"frequently prominent\". His club season finished a week later in a Roope Rooster semi-final loss to City Rovers.\nO'Brien's good form was rewarded when he was selected for Auckland in their match against Hamilton on 12 September at Carlaw Park. He was chosen at prop however there were several changes made to the side on the day of the match and he did not play. He was picked again for Auckland's match against an Auckland Province side on 29 September. He was named in the second row with Hec McDonald, while Nelson Bass was at lock. The Auckland City side won by 44 points to 15 before 7,000 spectators at Carlaw Park. He was involved in Hec McDonald’s try after toeing the ball through the Province sides defence. He took the ball and passed to McDonald who scored in the corner. O’Brien later scored a try when Clarrie Polson \"got the ball and sent it to O’Brien, who transferred to Dufty, and when being crowded out he sent a long pass to O’Brien, who gathered in to score\". The Auckland Star said afterwards that McDonald was easily the best forward and \"he received solid support from Stack and O’Brien\". O’Brien was then selected for Auckland's next match against South Auckland (Waikato) which was their final game of the season. The match was played once again at Carlaw Park and saw Auckland win 35–11 before a crowd of 6,000. Early in the second half with Auckland trailing 7–8 \"Thomas and O’Brien made an attack but lost the ball when within an ace of scoring\".\nIn 1924 O’Brien played 15 matches for Devonport and once again played 2 games for Auckland. Interestingly former All Black Andrew O'Brien switched codes and joined the Marist Old Boys rugby league club. He also went by the name Jim O'Brien which caused some confusion at times as to which player was being named in newspaper reports as they also both played prop and would be regularly selected for Auckland and later the New Zealand side.\nIn Devonport's second match on 10 May \"O'Brien, who had been playing well, distinguished himself by tackling Mike Flynn, who was making a good run with the ball\" with the match finishing a 2–2 draw. The following round he had a try disallowed in a 13–7 win over Richmond on 24 May. After round 5 on 31 May he was selected in a 22-man Auckland squad to prepare for the touring Australian University side. With the first match scheduled for midweek on 4 June. O'Brien was not selected for the starting side with Auckland winning the match 15 to 7. He was again left out of the starting side initially for the second match 3 days later on 7 June but was then brought into the side to replace Bill Stormont due to injury. Stormont would tragically die a year later from rheumatic heart disease. Auckland won the second match 17 to 2 before 4,000 spectators with the two Jim O’Brien's propping the scrum and Alf Townsend at hooker. Jim O'Brien (Devonport) was involved in the lead up to the first try to Ben Davidson. He was named to start again in an unchanged front row for the third match on 14 June. The match was drawn 14–14 before 12,000 spectators. O'Brien was involved in Auckland's first try when Craddock Dufty made a good run before \"he handed on to O'Brien [who] transferred to Douglas, who dashed over and scored a fine try\". The Auckland Star said that Hec McDonald was the best forward on the ground, \"and of the others O'Brien (Devonport) played a great game\".\nBack playing for Devonport he scored a try in a 16–15 win over Athletic. Of the Devonport forwards he \"showed up the most\". Then in a 24–3 win over Mangere he and Harry Douglas \"were the best of the forwards\". On 12 July Devonport were playing their rivals for the championship, Marist, and were thrashed 37–0 before 10,000 at Carlaw Park. The backs drew most of the criticism and Douglas, O'Brien, and Alf Scott were mentioned as being the \"only ones to display their best form\" in the losing side. He was then selected to play for Auckland B against Hamilton in a midweek match on 16 July. Auckland B won 28 to 18 in a side which still featured 9 current or future New Zealand representatives.\nDevonport continued their good run of form and after a loss to Ponsonby in round 10 they won against Ellerslie, Newton, and Mangere United with O'Brien involved in a try to Tommy Taylor in the later match which was played on Victoria Park. It was said that \"O'Brien and St George were always to the fore in the forward movements\". After the win Devonport led the championship with 19 competition points with Marist 2 behind on 17. They then lost a match to City Rovers before beating Marist and Athletic. This meant that Devonport had an 11–1–3 record through 16 rounds and Marist had a 10–1–3 record at the same time but had played one fewer match. The Auckland Rugby League decided to have the two sides play-off for the championship on 27 September. The match was played in front of an enormous club record crowd of 17,000 at Carlaw Park. Devonport were defeated 20–17 with Marist scoring a try in the last minute. O'Brien had had to leave the field with an injured shoulder early in the match with the score 5–2 to Marist. Marist also debuted Jack Kirwan, whose grandson John Kirwan would one day represent New Zealand at rugby union.\nNew Zealand selection.\nThe 1925 season saw O'Brien play 13 matches for Devonport and score 5 tries, a career high for him. He also played in 5 matches for Auckland and made his only appearance for New Zealand against Queensland.\nIn Devonport's opening round win over Richmond on 18 April by 29 points to 9, O'Brien passed to Allan Seagar who scored. Against Marist in a round 2 loss the Herald said \"[Norman] Veart, O'Brien, and [Horace] Dixon were the best of an even pack\". In round 4 Devonport was thrashed by Ponsonby 40–5, with O'Brien scoring their only try after a break by Horace Dixon saw him pass to O'Brien on the try line. It was said that aside from Dixon, \"O'Brien and [Norm] Veart worked very hard\". Then in their following match, another loss, this time to Athletic 8–6, \"O'Brien and Veart played a hard ruck game, keeping the ball at their feet\". He scored a try in their 29–11 win over Newton at the Devonport Domain on 30 May. After Alf Scott made a break he passed to Greig who passed \"to O'Brien who eluded his opponents and scored\" to give Devonport a 19–11 lead. He scored again a week later against City taking a pass from Stan Webb. Tom Haddon and Horace Dixon had been involved in the lead up toeing the ball ahead before Stan Webb had picked it up and handed it off to O'Brien \"who raced over to score\". The Herald said after the match that \"J. O'Brien was the best of the Devonport forwards. He played very ably, handling well and running strongly\". Then two weeks later on 20 June Devonport beat Marist 19–11 with O'Brien scoring once more. Marist tried a relieving kick through Charles Gregory near their line which was charged down with \"the ball going over the line, O'Brien diving for it\" and scoring. The Auckland Star wrote of the Devonport forwards that they \"worked hard all the time, particularly O'Brien, who is one of the best in Auckland\". While the New Zealand Herald said \"he showed up best with the ball at toe and worked very hard in the scrums\".\nO'Brien's form saw him chosen in an Auckland trial match in the B team along with Wally Somers and hooker and John Stormont at prop just 16 days after the death of his brother Bill. The match was played as curtain raiser to the inter-island match between the North Island and the South Island. O'Brien's B team won the match 5–0 with their try coming after he \"kicked hard over the A team's line\" following a scrum and J. Payne followed up to score. A third match was also played between an Auckland side and South Auckland and the New Zealand selectors chose the touring squad for Australia with O'Brien missing selection. He was however selected for the Auckland team to play against the touring New Zealand side. The match was played on 2 July at Carlaw Park with New Zealand winning 16–9. After some attacking movements \"O'Brien dived over\" to make the score 8–6 to New Zealand during the first half.\nHe returned to the Devonport side with several matches and was once again one of their best players despite a 22–5 loss to Ponsonby on 11 July. In a round 1 Roope Rooster win over Marist Old Boys, O'Brien scored the winning try after Alf Scott kicked high and the ball ricocheted off the base of the goal post to him and he \"gathered it up and fell over the line\". The try gave them a 13–12 lead with the conversion making the final score 15–12. When he scored he \"hit the post hard … and play was held up for sometime\". The Herald during the week said that O'Brien had been \"in the thick of the play, his deadly tackling being a feature of the game\". Devonport were knocked out of the Roope Rooster competition the following week and this ended their season.\nAfter the conclusion of the club season O'Brien was selected for a series of representative games. He was first chosen in the Auckland team to play South Auckland on 19 August. The other prop was Arthur Singe, with Alf Townsend at hooker. Auckland won the match by 24 points to 16 to reclaim the Northern Union Challenge Cup which South Auckland had held since 1922. He was then selected to play for Auckland again against the returning New Zealand side who had come home from their Australian tour. He was propping again with Arthur Singe but this time his Devonport teammate Neville St George was at hooker. New Zealand won easily by 41 points to 17 before a large crowd of 17,000 at Carlaw Park. In the first half O'Brien broke quickly from a scrum and took play down to halfway. The \"New Zealand Truth\" newspaper said that \"O'Brien, with dribbling rushes, was prominent amongst the forwards, and on one occasion he had a run of nearly 50 yards, being only stopped by Gregory, the All Black full-back\". After the match the \"Auckland Star\" said that the best of Auckland's forwards were \"O'Brien and Singe, and they were equal to any in the New Zealand pack\". He and Singe, along with Ben Davidson were added by the New Zealand selectors to their squad to prepare to play against the touring Queensland side. The Herald had also noted that \"a feature of the game was the excellent display given by the Devonport forward, O'Brien, who was a great worker and must have impressed the New Zealand selectors. He was not selected in the starting thirteen and was named as one of the two forward reserves along with Horace Dixon.\nHe was however chosen for the Auckland side to play the Queensland tourists on 9 September. His team mate Neville St George was at hooker while his Marist namesake Jim O'Brien was the other prop. In a curious mystery one of them scored a try in their 18–18 draw but it has remained unclear ever since as to which of them scored. The try came late in the match after a \"cross-kick by [Maurice] Wetherill was badly missed by [Bill] Spencer, and O'Brien following up gathered in the ball to score\". It is perhaps slightly more likely that it was the Devonport O'Brien due to the nature of the try as he was well known for following up on kicks with several of his tries coming from them. The try was converted by Frank Delgrosso and it tied the score at 18 which it remained. The \"New Zealand Herald\" described the try in different detail saying that \"following a high kick by Singe, Spencer mulled the ball and was bustled by Avery and O'Brien. The latter gathered up the ball and scored\".\nJim O'Brien was finally selected to make his New Zealand debut in the second test with Queensland on 12 September at Carlaw Park. He was chosen to play in the second row with Arthur Singe, with Jim O'Brien (Marist), and Ernie Herring in the propping positions. The match was won comfortably by Queensland 35–14 before a crowd of 15,000. He was mentioned in both main newspapers match reports but they did not distinguish between the two of them so it is difficult to know who was featuring though much of it was in good open attacking play.\nFollowing the test O'Brien was chosen for Auckland to play South Auckland in a Northern Union Challenge Cup defence on 19 September. He scored a try after he \"accepted a pass which was sent across by Riley\" in a 36–19 win. He was named in the reserves for the Auckland Province side to play the touring Queensland side but was not required to take the field and his season was over.\nContinuation of Devonport and Auckland representation.\nThe 1926 season saw O'Brien play 13 matches for Devonport, scoring 4 tries, and a 6 matches for Auckland scoring 5 tries, both career highs for Auckland. The New Zealand selectors were playing several trial matches to try to find the touring side for the England and Wales tour and he played in some of these matches too.\nIn March he was elected on to the committee of the Devonport United committee at their annual meeting with \"about 100 members\" in attendance. In their opening match of the season on 24 April against Ponsonby they had several injuries and were only left with three forwards, namely O'Brien, Neville St George, and Horace Dixon. O'Brien and Dixon were \"always on the ball\", and if not for the injuries may have won the match. In round 4 against Grafton Athletic he was part of a forward pack that \"broke away time after time with O'Brien putting in great work\". In round 8 he scored in a loss to Ponsonby (19–16) after Cleaver kicked high and the ball struck the goal posts and rebounded into O'Brien's hands. The \"Auckland Star\" said that he and teammate Ernest Ruby, \"were in the thick of everything\".\nMissed New Zealand selection.\nJim O'Brien was then selected for Auckland’s opening representative match of the season against South Auckland on 26 June. The club competition went into a hiatus for a month as a series of representative matches were played prior to the New Zealand team being selected. He played prop along with Arthur Singe, with Alf Townsend at hooker. The selectors were Edward Fox, Ernie Asher, and Scotty McClymont. The \"New Zealand Herald\" remarked that \"J O'Brien and [Alf] Scott, both of Devonport, are two players who by sheer ability have earned the right to wear the Auckland jersey… O'Brien is a great worker, His tackling at times is a treat to watch\". Auckland thrashed the Waikato-based side 49–15 before 8,000 spectators at Carlaw Park with O'Brien scoring 2 tries. The game was so one sided that when Auckland led 33–3 at halftime they gave no fewer than five players to the South Auckland team to start the second half. His first try came after Hector Cole \"made an opening\" for him to get across the try line, while his second try was the last of the match and happened after \"Avery, Singe, Townsend, and O'Brien broke away, O'Brien scoring for Singe to goal\".\nAfter the match the North Island selectors chose their side to play the South Island but Ernie Herring and Arthur Singe were both preferred at prop. O'Brien was however chosen in the curtain raiser which was a New Zealand trial match between A and B sides. He was in the A team with Joe Menzies (Waikato) in the other propping position and they were up against Thomas and Avery. The sides were dominated by Auckland players with only 4 of the 26 named players from outside the Auckland club competition. The match was played on 3 July and saw the B side win 25–16. A massive crowd of 18,000 were present for the inter-island game which followed. He initiated a try early in the second half when from a ruck in the centre of the field he dashed through and set Lou Brown away to combine with Hec Brisbane before Brown scored between the posts. Then shortly after he \"heaved a long pass to Brown on the wing, the latter making a short dash, then in-passing to Brisbane, to Riley, who got across wide out\". Near the end of the game he got over the line but lost the ball and the game finished shortly after. Four days later on 7 July, O'Brien played in a match for Auckland against \"The Rest\" of New Zealand. All the matches were being played at Carlaw Park. He was prop with Ernie Herring on the other side of the scrum. Joe Menzies and Alphonsus Carroll were the opposing props. The \"Rest of\" New Zealand side won the match 28–21 before a midweek crowd of 4,000. O'Brien was then chosen in the final trial match which was for the Possibles in a New Zealand trial. He was at prop along with Menzies and J. Tallentire of the West Coast at hooker. The props for the Probables side were Vivian of Canterbury and Ernie Herring of Auckland.\nHis Possibles side won the match 32–15 with a crowd of 10,000 on hand. After the match, and an A/B trial played as curtain raiser, the New Zealand selectors chose the touring side for England with O'Brien missing selection. He was named in group of 4 forwards as reserves in case any of those selected was unable to tour. It was said in particular that if a front row forward was to be unavailable O'Brien would have taken their place. The Auckland Star in an article on the selections said that \"Clarke, O’Brien (North Shore), and Hutt (Ponsonby) are three good forwards unlucky to miss selection, but in regard to forwards it must be admitted that the selectors greatest difficulty was to decide who to leave out\". While the \"New Zealand Herald\" said that \"it will be recognised that in Menzies and O'Brien two very good forwards were omitted, and both are a little unlucky… O'Brien was always conspicuous by his dashing play and he is equal to any of the front-row forwards chosen\".\nFollowing the naming of the New Zealand side the Auckland club competition resumed. In Devonport’s first game on 17 July they won 24–0 over Richmond with O'Brien scoring a try after Allan Seagar \"despatched O'Brien for a very fine try\". After a win over Marist on 24 July the Auckland side was named to play the New Zealand side before their departure. Joe Menzies had been added to the New Zealand touring side as L. Vivian of Canterbury was unable to travel. This meant that if a single forward had thereafter been unable to tour O'Brien would have come into the side. He was propping for Auckland with Jim O'Brien of Marist, up against Frank Henry, and Ernie Herring. It is unlikely that the touring side took the match overly seriously as they were trounced by Auckland 52–32 before a crowd of 14,000 at Carlaw Park on 31 July. O'Brien scored twice with his first coming after a kick from Craddock Dufty was \"smothered [by George Wade and] in the scramble for the ball\" he secured possession and scored. His second came after the crowd were allegedly shouting \"change jerseys\" with the Auckland side leading 42–24 and \"O'Brien thought he would get a try, so he went over, and St George placed a goal\". He was also involved in a first half try to George Wade when \"speed from the scrum saw Peckham send O'Brien away. He passed to Wade, who showed rare pace and completed the effort with a fine try\". A writer for the \"Auckland Star\" said during the following week that \"Herring and Thomas are fortunate in getting a trip in preference to O'Brien (Devonport), and [John] Stormont and Jim O'Brien, both of Marist Bros.\".\nAuckland selection.\nO’Brien's next match was for Auckland against Otago. He was originally named in a 19-man squad before making the starting team. It was the first ever time that an Otago team had played in Auckland and they were defeated 14–4. O’Brien and Alf Scott were said to be \"the pick of the forwards\".\nHe scored the final try for Devonport in their 42–8 round 11 win over Maritime. He was said to be Devonport's \"best forward\" along with Alf Scott. He was picked to play for Auckland once more against Canterbury on 28 August at Carlaw Park. Auckland won 33–15 with 7,000 in attendance. It was commented afterwards that \"O’Brien again proved a fine forward in the open, and he handled the ball with the ability of a three quarter\".\nIn Devonport's final championship match of the season against City he was said to be the best forward in their 14–9 loss which saw them finish 4th of 7. A photograph of O’Brien being tackled by John Stormont was published in the New Zealand Herald after the Roope Rooster semi-final win over Marist 28–11.\nHe was then chosen in the Auckland side to play the South Auckland team from the Waikato on 9 October. Auckland won 35 to 8 with O’Brien gathering a \"head high\" pass to \"gallop straight through and score under the bar\". He also initiated a try earlier after he \"made an opening for List, whose straight running carried him to the visitors 25, where he passed to Seagar, who cut in nicely and scored\". It was commented later how hard he and Lou Hutt worked for Auckland.\nHis final match of the season was against Richmond Rovers on 16 October in the Roope Rooster final. Devonport lost 16–15 before 4,000 spectators. With the score 16–10 in Richmond's favour he scored a try following a break by Cleaver who passed to Seagar, \"who cut in prettily and sent the ball on to O’Brien, who dashed over\". O’Brien was \"in everything that was going\" during the match along with Douglas and Alf Scott.\n1927, Devonport captaincy and sendoffs.\nThe 1927 season was to be the last significant season of O’Brien's playing career. With Alf Scott not playing for Devonport, O’Brien took over the captaincy of the senior side. He played 11 matches for Devonport, 5 for Auckland, and he also made his solitary appearance for the North Island. At the beginning of the season in early April he was asked to go into training with 18 others to prepare for a match between Auckland and the returning Auckland members of the New Zealand side from their controversial tour of England and Wales. Eight players had gone on strike after falling out with the team coach and would be suspended for life. One of these was fellow Auckland prop, Arthur Singe who had his place taken in the side by Joe Menzies of the Waikato. O’Brien was chosen for the match day side and Auckland won 24–21 before 14,000 spectators. Early in the game he \"sent a long pass to List, and the Kingsland centre, racing on a diagonal line, got across with a couple of black backs hanging on to him\". The conversion gave Auckland a 5–3 lead. A while later \"passing by Clarke to O’Brien to Clarke to Hutt, and back to Clarke – brilliant dove tail play that shattered the tourists’ defence – let Clarke in to score with ease\". he later lost a scoring opportunity when Clarke \"raced through, sending Hutt and O’Brien away, but\" O’Brien's \"pass to Dixon was forward, and a certain try was lost\". It was said after the match that he was \"often prominent\" with Dixon. In Devonport's season opening game against City O’Brien scored a try in a 23–19 loss. He \"stood out for wonderful all-round play\" and was a \"tireless worker\". A week later in a 12–8 loss to Marist O’Brien was badly injured and \"treated in the casualty ward for an injury to his head\". He had \"stood out\" among the forwards along with Dick Moisley before he had to go off and was a \"fine leader\". A spectator commented in a letter to the editor that \"O’Brien played a brilliant game marred by an unlucky accident. We have no doubt he would have scored otherwise\". He missed Devonport's next match against Grafton but returned for their next match against Richmond on Friday 3 June as part of the King's Birthday celebrations. He scored a try late in the match won by Devonport 17–13. The try put Devonport in the lead 14–13 but the game was marred by the sending off of 4 players near the end. Neville St George had exchanged words with the referee and was sent from the field, then Stewart from Richmond was ordered off 2 minutes later before Stan Prentice and the O’Brien soon received their marching orders too. The New Zealand Herald said \"it is to be regretted that O’Brien, the Devonport captain, and Prentice, Richmond, earned the displeasure of the referee\", though \"O’Brien’s sound handling was a feature of his play\".\nIn an article on the representative sides for the season the Auckland Star suggested that O’Brien, Bert Avery, Alan Clarke, Lou Hutt, and J. Payne were the best prospects for the loose forward positions. In Devonport's 32–8 win over Newton on 18 June O’Brien \"played splendidly in the forwards\" After their 10–3 win over City the following week he was said to be \"always in the picture\" and a portrait photograph of O’Brien was published in the article. While the Herald said he \"is undoubtedly one of the finest forwards playing the code\". In their 2 July loss to Marist by 16 points to 6 O’Brien was sent off for the second time in the season in front of a large crowd of 11,000. A punch had been thrown by a Devonport player and then \"a moment later when the referee sorted out a tangle of players and gave J. O’Brien (Devonport) a free pass to the side line, the crowd cheering a sympathetic action when J. O'Brien (Marist) stopped to shake hands with his namesake\". After the match the Devonport supporters went on to the field to voice their opinion. It was reported that \"penalties against Devonport were responsible for most of the outbursts of derisive comment and shouted protest, and a particularly active demonstration followed the ordering off of O’Brien, the Devonport captain, for alleged rough play. When the full-time whistle blew an angry crowd surged toward the referee, who was closely attended by two policemen as he walked from the field\". The referee was H. Taylor who was pulled in to referee prior to the match after W. Ripley was unable to due to illness. The Sun reported that \"the play went perilously close to getting completely out of hand and after a general warning to the two teams, O’Brien… was sent from the field\". Jack Kirwan of the Marist side asked the referee to allow O’Brien to stay on the field. it was also reported that \"up to the time that the referee sent him off, O’Brien was playing a great game. His alleged misdeed was not in sight-seeing range of the press bench, and the first indication of something untoward was the Shore forward trekking for the sideline, holding uplifted hands as a token of injured innocence\". The Auckland Rugby League judicial committee recommended that O’Brien should be stood down for one game and the recommendation was approved. During the week the Devonport club sent a letter to the Marist club stating \"my club wishes to place upon record its keen appreciation of the fine sporting spirit displayed by Kirwan and O'Brien when they interceded on behalf of J. O’Brien (Shore) on the occasion of the player being ordered off. The attitude taken up by the players mentioned calls forth our highest admiration\". He missed the match against Grafton before returning to play Richmond on 6 August. Devonport won 18–8 with O’Brien grafting hard along with Sid Rule and Neville St George, and he and Ruby \"were outstanding in the loose\". In Devonport's last match for the championship where they finished third of seven they lost 5–0 to City. O’Brien \"was keen in the loose and strong in the ruck\".\nAuckland vice-captaincy and North Island selection.\nOn 28 August the Auckland selectors (Asher, Fox, and Blakey) chose O’Brien among a squad of 18 for their southern tour.\nTheir first match was against Canterbury at Monica Park in Christchurch on 10 September. Before a crowd of 3,000 Auckland won 24–13 with O’Brien and Lou Hutt making \"many openings for their side by fine play\". He was one of their outstanding players along with Maurice Wetherill, Stan Prentice, Wilson, and Wally Somers. In their next match against a combined West Coast/Buller team, won by Auckland 42–15 at Victoria Park, in Greymouth, O’Brien was \"conspicuous\" among the forwards.\nO’Brien had been named vice-captain for the tour with Maurice Wetherill as captain. They were also appointed selectors along with William Mincham who was on tour as the manager.\nTheir next match came at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin and saw Auckland beat Otago 201–3 with O’Brien scoring a try. It came after Wetherill initiated a clever movement near halfway got the Auckland backs going, with George Wade carrying on with O’Brien who scored near the posts with Craddock Dufty converting to give Auckland a 10–5 lead. O’Brien was not selected (by himself) for the final tour match against Wellington at Newtown Park, Wellington in a match Auckland won 41–23.\nHe was then selected to make his first ever appearance in the inter-island match between North Island and South Island on 24 September at Carlaw Park. He was chosen at prop along with Timms from the Waikato and Wally Somers at hooker. Auckland won 13–8 before 7,000 spectators. O’Brien was said to have been \"in everything that was going\" and provided good support to Timms who was outstanding.\nO’Brien was then named in the Auckland team to play Buller but he informed the selectors that he was unavailable and Trevor Hall replaced him in the side. He was however available to play in Auckland's final representative match of the season against South Auckland on 15 October. Auckland lost the match 29–12 before 5,000 spectators and they also relinquished the Northern Union Challenge Cup. His final match of the season was for Devonport in their Roope Rooster final defeat to Richmond by 7 points to 6.\nFinal season and first club championship.\nAt the start of the season it was reported that O’Brien was likely to play once more. However he had retired and after 5 rounds with the representative season approaching the Herald said that the selectors had a difficulty in the front row as \"last season with O’Brien (Marist) and O’Brien (Devonport), Auckland had two of the best front row forwards seen for years. The pair were masters in scrum work and deadly tacklers in the loose\". The Auckland Star also wrote that \"the selectors will probably be faced with the difficulty of getting the class of forward for the front row that is required, seeing that since last season two stalwarts in J. O’Brien (Marist) and J. O’Brien (Devonport) have dropped out, and there is the obvious difficulty in finding two players of similar physique and skill to take their places\".\nTwo weeks later however in round 8 O’Brien of Devonport came out of retirement to play for Devonport in their match with City Rovers at the Devonport Domain. Devonport won the match narrowly by 8 points to 6. They were undefeated to this point with 7 wins from 7 matches. He was listed in the reserves but started the match. It was said that he \"did some solid tackling\" and \"making his first appearance, played an excellent game\". Two weeks later after consecutive losses to Newton and Marist it was commented that he \"lacked condition\". The match was also notable because his Marist namesake had come out of retirement to play for them. After another loss to Richmond the Herald said that \"O’Brien proved he has the offside rule down to a fine art\". The match was played at a frenetic pace and was widely praised in the media. The Sun noted that he \"was frequently in the picture\" along with Sid Rule and Neville St George. While the Star said \"O’Brien’s reappearance has strengthened the side, and on his showing he merits consideration for the representative selections\". In a 24–6 win over Ponsonby in round 13 O’Brien scored his first points of the season when he crossed for 2 tries. The first came when he fielded a wild clearing kick from Letton \"and, being unmarked, went across for an easy try\" with Len Scott converting to give Devonport a 10–0 lead. Then in the second half Ernest Ruby \"raced through the Ponsonby backs, passing to O’Brien who raced in between the posts\" with Ruby converting for a 21–0 lead. Then a week later Devonport sealed their third ever championship which was the first of O’Brien's career. The North Shore club had previously won in 1913, and 1914. Remarkably despite being a strong club in the 1920s it was their only major title. O’Brien scored another try in the 33–16 win, with \"poor tackling by Ellerslie enabling him to race over from the twenty-five\". The Sun said that he and Ruby were the two \"crack Shore forwards\". it was also suggested that he \"was one of the shining lights of the Shore van and is a much better forward than some people – even rep. selectors – think that he is\".\nO’Brien was then selected for the Auckland squad to go into training for their match with Otago on 15 September. He played in a round 1 Roope Rooster win over Ellerslie before being selected for the starting side for the Auckland match. Despite this he did not play in the game so must have been unavailable.\nHe finished the season with two final games for Devonport. The first was a semi-final loss to Marist on 22 September before his last ever match which was against Marist again in the Stormont Shield final which was played between the winners of the championship and the winners of the Roope Rooster knockout competition. In the Roope Rooster semi-final loss it was said that he \"played well\" along with Rule and Casey. O’Brien was selected for the Auckland team to play North Auckland on 6 October in Whangārei but withdrew and so ended his career after nine seasons of senior rugby league at the age of 32. The following year in 1929, he was on the junior management committee of the Devonport club.\nCoaching.\nIn 1931 O'Brien was chosen to coach the Devonport senior side. They finished runner up in the championship with a 10 win - 2 loss record before going on to win the Roope Rooster competition when they defeated Ponsonby 34-17 in the final. They then played Marist (who had won the championship) for the Stormont Shield and won 25-6.\nLife and death.\nJim O’Brien was a painter by trade. In the early 1920s he was living at 12 Rutland Road in Devonport with his brother John Terence. They still resided there in 1925 and 1928 according to the censuses. In 1925 he was the president of the Dominion Painters’ Federation and represented them at the bi-annual conference of unions in Napier. In 1927 his father, James died while still living on the West Coast of the South Island in Brunnerton, Grey.\nHe was also a fire fighter and in 1929 won a competition at the Marine Borough Fire Brigade competition for the Fletcher Cup at Takapuna. It involved a \"two man coupling event (old style)\" and he won with foreman Colley. In August 1930 he was presented with a certificate for 3 years service in the fire brigade at the annual smoke concert of the Devonport Municipal Volunteer Fire Brigade.\nThe following year in 1931 O’Brien married Dorothy Franklin on 6 April at the All Souls’ Church, Devonport. Dorothy had been born on 9 September 1903, in Rotherham, England. She was the eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C.F. Franklin, of Empire Road, Devonport. After leaving the church the couple \"passed through the guard of honour formed by the Children of Mary, and under the raised hatchets of members of the Devonport Fire Brigade, of which the bridegroom is a member\". Dorothy was \"a sister of Sister Nellie, of the 3rd Order of Mary, France, who left New Zealand 13 months [prior] to devote her life to nursing the lepers at Makogai\". They had a son on 31 July 1932, at the Pentlands Private Hospital in Devonport. The hospital was located at 19 Buchanan Street and existed from 1926 to 1975. At the time they were living on 6 Grove Road, Devonport and remained there until the early 1950s according to census records.\nIn February 1935 O’Brien travelled to a National fire brigade competition at Blenheim. In 1940 he presented \"gold stars\" to fire brigade members for 25 years service.\nBy 1957 the family had moved to the Devonport Fire Station to live as he was the fire officer there. Then in 1960 they had moved to 12 Waimana Avenue on Northcote Point though he still had the position of fire officer. By the early 1960s he had retired and remained living on Waimana Avenue for several decades.\nJim and Dorothy had another two daughters. One of whom (the youngest) was Mary O'Brien-Specht who was born at Pentlands in 1937. Mary left New Zealand in 1963 to pursue an operatic singing career. She had been tutored by Dame Sister Mary Leo who had also tutored Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Dame Malvina Major. Mary won the John Court Memorial Aria competition in 1958 and in 1959 won the Mobil Song Quest which had started in 1956. In 1959 she joined the New Zealand Opera Company. In 1963 she moved to Sydney to perform and then in 1965 made the move to Europe and sang in Linz, Austria. She performed throughout Europe and later moved to the United States and married Don Specht. When she phoned up her father Jim to tell him of her engagement he replied \"so you’re going to marry a Yank?\". She last performed in the late 1980s and retired in Los Angeles before he husband's death. She then returned to live in New Zealand. As of 2016 both her siblings were still alive, her brother living in Papakura and older sister in a convent in Dunedin after she had become a nun aged 20.\nJim O'Brien's brother John died in 1975 and his other brother Patrick died in 1983.\nJim's wife, Dorothy died on 19 January 1987, and Jim died a little over a year later on 6 April 1988, aged 91 while they both still resided on the North Shore of Auckland. Jim is buried in the military section of the Waikaraka Cemetery."

        "text": "The 2022 FIFA Club World Cup (officially known as the FIFA Club World Cup Morocco 2022 presented by Visit Saudi for sponsorship reasons) was the 19th edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised international club football tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions. The tournament was held from 1 to 11 February 2023 in Morocco.\nChelsea were the defending champions, but they were not able to defend their title as they did not qualify after being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League by eventual winners Real Madrid. The Spanish side went on to win the Club World Cup for a record fifth time, beating Al Ahly of Egypt 4–1 in the semi-finals before a 5–3 win over Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in the final.\nThis edition also marked the first time a club from the United States (Seattle Sounders FC) took part in the tournament.\nBackground and host appointment.\nWhile the Club World Cup was typically played annually in December, the 2022 tournament could not take place during this period due to the scheduling of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar in November and December 2022. This, in conjunction with FIFA's planned future expansion of the Club World Cup, resulted in few public details on whether the 2022 tournament would take place. However, US$20 million was allocated for the Club World Cup in FIFA's 2023 budget. In December 2022, CONCACAF president Victor Montagliani implied the Club World Cup would take place in 2023, but would not be hosted by the United States. On 14 December, FIFA announced the host and tournament dates would be confirmed at the FIFA Council meeting in Doha, Qatar, on 16 December.\nIn May 2022, \"UOL Esporte\" reported that Japan were interested in hosting the tournament, having won hosting rights for the previous tournament before backing out due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. \"UOL Esporte\" also reported in August that China were interested in holding the tournament, having originally been chosen to host an expanded Club World Cup in 2021 which was postponed due to scheduling issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In September, \"Diario AS\" reported that the United States and the United Arab Emirates, hosts of the previous tournament, were also interested in staging the tournament. In December, \"Diario AS\" reported that Morocco, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were the final contenders to host the tournament. On 16 December 2022, the FIFA Council appointed Morocco as the host for the tournament, and confirmed it would take place from 1 to 11 February 2023. \"Diario AS\" also reported that the final of the 2022 AFC Champions League, which had been pushed back to finish in May 2023 due to scheduling issues, would be moved forward to facilitate the scheduling of the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup. However, the AFC confirmed on 23 December 2022 that as the 2022 AFC Champions League would not be completed in time, Al-Hilal would be their representative at the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup as the reigning champions from the 2021 AFC Champions League.\nQualified teams.\nNotes\nVenues.\nThe matches were played at two venues, the Ibn Batouta Stadium in Tangier and the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat.\nMatch officials.\nOn 14 January 2023, FIFA announced that six referees, twelve assistant referees and eight video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament.\nSquads.\nEach team named a 23-man squad (three of whom had to be goalkeepers). Injury replacements were allowed until 24 hours before the team's first match.\nMatches.\nThe draw of the tournament was held on 13 January 2023, 12:00 CET, at the Mohammed VI Football Academy in Salé, Morocco, to decide the matchups of the second round (between the first round winner and teams from AFC, CAF and CONCACAF), and the opponents of the two second round winners in the semi-finals (against teams from CONMEBOL and UEFA). In the second round draw, Wydad Casablanca and the winner of the first round match were pre-allocated to separate fixtures, with their opponents selected from the draw pot. The match kick-off times and venues were confirmed after the draw.\nIf a match was tied after normal playing time:\nAll times are local, CET ().\nMatch for third place.\nThe match for third place, originally scheduled to be played at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium, Rabat, was moved on 9 February 2023 to Ibn Batouta Stadium, Tangier, in order to preserve the pitch for the final.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. Vinícius Júnior of Real Madrid won the Golden Ball award.\nFIFA also named a man of the match for the best player in each game at the tournament.\nSponsorship.\nPresenting Partner\nFIFA Partners\nTournament Supporter"

Coming into the finals, Gut was still behind Vonn, but she and two other racers (Liechtenstein's Tina Weirather and Austria's Cornelia Hütter) could overtake Vonn with strong performances in the finals. Gut's second-place finish (worth 80 points) gave her the season title, while Weirather's victory (worth 100 points) enabled her to edge into second, with Vonn relegated to third."

        "text": "The women's super-G in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup included eight events, including the final. The original schedule called for nine events, but a scheduled downhill at St. Anton on 14 January was converted to a super-G due to the inability to hold pre-race practice runs on either of the two days prior to the event. A later super-G at Cortina was converted into a downhill to restore the original schedule balance, but then a downhill at Crans Montana on 25 February had to be delayed a day due to fog and dangerous course conditions, and the super-G previously scheduled for that day was cancelled and not rescheduled.\nAfter seven events, there had been seven different race winners from five different countries. The seventh race, in Kvitfjell, was particularly unusual because it started during a blizzard, but conditions eased for the later starters; the entire podium (all Austrians) had starting positions located after the break taken after the top skiers in the discipline had finished (the first 22 positions).\nGoing into the eighth race (the World Cup final), last season's Super-G runner-up, Elena Curtoni of Italy, held a narrow lead in the discipline standings, although the top five (Curtoni, Lara Gut-Behrami, Ragnhild Mowinckel, Cornelia Hütter, and defending discipline champion Federica Brignone) were separated by only 44 points. That final was won by Gut-Behrami (with Brignone second and Mowinckel third), who thus became the only two-time winner in Super-G for the season and repeated as discipline champion for the fourth time (along with 2014, 2016, and 2021).\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's super-G was held in Méribel on 8 February.\nThe World Cup final took place on Thursday, 16 March in Soldeu, Andorra. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup Super-G discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points. The only \"500-point\" skiers in the race were Ilka Štuhec of Slovenia and Petra Vlhová of Slovakia, who did not earn points."

Clark in his 4th seasons.\nSeason.\nContinuing with the increasing profile of the program, Lafayette was set to join a new 6-team conference for 1941. The initial group included former conference opponents Lehigh and Penn, as well as St. Joseph's, La Salle and Drexel. On top of those league games, the Leopards were also expecting to play Penn State and Georgetown and Princeton J.V., which would nearly double the number of games they had played the year before. Owing to the eastern shift of the new conference, all league games would be played at the Philadelphia Arena on Mondays.\nFor the first time in its short history, Lafayette won its season opener. Largely on the strength of Tony Cavallo and Donald Bush, the team was able to hold Drexel off the scoresheet in mostly defensive battle. They were originally schedulted to play Temple the following week but that game was cancelled and the Leopards didn't play again until February. Once they returned to the ice, they lost a hard-fought game to Lehigh due to the spectacular exploits of the Engineer goalie. The team's offense finally began to click in their third game and Lafayette thumped La Salle to the tune of 9–0. A further trouncing of St. Joe's put the Leopards into a three-way tie for first place in the league standings.\nLafayette had its big chance to win the title when they took on Penn in mid March. However, in what was expected to be a close affair, the Quakers dominated and shattered the Leopards championship dreams with a 6-1 drubbing. Unfortunately for Lafayette, that was the final game of the season. None of the non-conference games ever materialized and the solid Leopard team wasn't able to build upon its success.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

He is known for his participation in the 1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton men's basketball game, and was the 1989 Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. He is the son of professional gridiron football player Bob Scrabis.\nEarly life.\nScrabis is the son of Bob and Janis, and has two sisters, Amy and Kristin. His father played football at Penn State before playing in the American Football League for the New York Titans. Raised in Avon-by-the-Sea, New Jersey, Scrabis attended Red Bank Catholic High School where he played point guard and graduated as the school's all-time leading scorer. In high school, he was included in the \"Sports Illustrated\" \"Faces in the Crowd\" section of the March 12, 1984, edition of the magazine for a 23–24 free throw shooting performance in a victory over Long Branch High School. As a senior, he averaged 20.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists.\nCollege career.\nScrabis had several memorable performances in the Penn–Princeton men's basketball rivalry. As a sophomore, he hit a jumper with three seconds left to force overtime against Penn on February 3, 1987, but Princeton lost by a point. In the rematch held three weeks later, he established a career high with 24 points to lead Princeton to a 63–59 victory. In the March 1988 Penn–Princeton game, Scrabis connected on 2 free throws with 11 seconds remaining for the 67–65 victory over .\nOn December 30, 1988, Scrabis helped defeat 16th-ranked South Carolina with a 26-point performance. In the final game of the regular season of his senior year on March 4, 1989, Scrabis scored 19 second half points to lead Princeton to a 74–63 Ivy League-clinching and NCAA Tournament bid-clinching victory over .\nThe March 17, 1989 Georgetown vs. Princeton men's basketball game was a first-round game in the 1989 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament that pitted the number 1 seed Georgetown Hoyas against the number 16 seed Princeton Tigers. Scrabis took the first of two shots in the closing seconds of the game that were blocked by Alonzo Mourning to preserve a 50–49 margin of victory for Georgetown. He rebounded a missed free throw with 23 seconds remaining. Then, his three point shot was blocked with 8 seconds left. With 15 points, he was Princeton's high scorer in the game. Because of his role in preserving NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament invitations for lesser automatic bids, Bleacher Report described Scrabis as \"the face of Cinderella\".\nScrabis was an All-Ivy first team selection in 1988 and 1989 and earned Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1989. He ended his career as Princeton's 4th leading scorer (behind Bill Bradley, Pete Campbell and Craig Robinson). He played forward for Princeton. As a senior he served as captain of the 1988–89 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team.\nProfessional career.\nIn October 1989, following his basketball career he was invited to the training camp at Princeton's Jadwin Gym for the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association by Willis Reed, but he was released after 9 days. He retired from basketball and eventually went into finance."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a catcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. The catcher is a defensive position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to these primary duties, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the catcher is assigned the number 2.\nDouble Plays Turned as C.\nCatchers typically record double plays by throwing out a runner attempting to steal a base immediately after the batter has struck out, by tagging out a runner attempting to score a run after receiving a throw from an outfielder on an attempted sacrifice fly, by stepping on home plate to force out a runner with the bases loaded and then throwing out another runner (often the batter trying to reach first base), or by tagging out a runner attempting to score after an out has been recorded at another base. Double plays are also occasionally recorded when a rundown play is involved, almost always as the second out. On August 2, 1985, Carlton Fisk of the Chicago White Sox recorded a double play by tagging out two New York Yankees moments apart at home plate when both tried to score on a double. The feat was duplicated by Paul Lo Duca of the New York Mets in Game 1 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nMany of the career leaders were active during baseball's dead-ball era when runners made more aggressive attempts to advance around the bases in risky situations; 13 of the top 18 single-season totals, and 28 of the top 37, were recorded before 1928. Ray Schalk holds the record for the most career double plays by a catcher with 222. Steve O'Neill is second with 198; only seven other catchers have recorded 150 career double plays."

        "text": "1880 Women's Tennis season was mainly composed of national, regional, county, local regular amateur tournaments. This year, 13 tennis events for women were staged, one in India, three of them in Ireland and nine events in England between May and October 1880.\nSeason summary.\nThe women's amateur tennis seasons covers a period of thirty five years from 1876 to 1912. During this period there was no single international organization responsible for overseeing tennis. At the very start in tennis history lawn tennis clubs themselves organized events and some like the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in England (f.1877) and the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club, Ireland (f.1879) generally oversaw tennis in their respective countries.\nThis would later change when tennis players started (those that could) traveled the world to compete in events organized by individual national lawn tennis associations (NLTA)'s the oldest of which then was the United States Lawn Tennis Association (f. 1881). In certain countries that did not establish a national association until later, had provincial, regional or state lawn tennis associations overseeing tournaments in a province, region or state within a country, such as the Northern Lawn Tennis Association in Manchester, England (f.1880), had responsibility for coordinating tournaments staged by clubs in the North of England region. In Australia the Victorian Lawn Tennis Association (f.1904) organised tournaments in the state of Victoria, Australia.\nIn 1880 twelve tournaments for women were staged four of them in Ireland, and nine of them in England. In the spring in May the second Irish Championships are held this was the first major national championships in the world to feature not only a women's singles event won by a D. Meldon, but also a ladies doubles event, and a mixed doubles event. In August the Armagh Tennis Tournament is staged at the Archery Lawn Tennis Club, Armagh that features a mixed doubles event. In India at the close of May the Calcutta Cricket Club (f.1792), inaugurated an open lawn tennis tournament that featured 21 entries.\nIn June two tournaments are held featuring women's events. At the Devon and Cornwall Archery Society Tournament held at Manadon , Plymouth, Devon, England a mixed doubles event is won by Miss Keate and Mr. A. Radcliffe. From June 14 to 22 the Kemptown Tournament was staged at Kemptown, Brighton, East Sussex, England that featured a ladies doubles event, that was won by two sister Miss Adshead and Miss. Eva Adshead, this event was notable in that this match was played over five sets. On 16 August the fourth annual Waterford Lawn Tennis Tournament was begun. On July 1 the Mersey Bowmen Archery Club Tournament began at Sefton Park, Aigburth in Liverpool, England, however it was not concluded until August 19. On August 16 the Devonshire Park Lawn Tennis Club began the Devonshire Park Championships at Eastbourne, England. Between 16 and 17 August the Mount's Bay Archery and Lawn tennis Clubs staged a two-day Mount's Bay Lawn Tennis Tournament at Mount's Bay. Penzance, Cornwall, England, the ladies singles being won by Miss. Jackson and the gentleman's singles by Mr. H. H. Ley of Truro.\nIn September 1880 the fifth edition of South of Ireland Championships in Limerick the singles event was won by Annie Rice. The same month the Ealing Cricket Club staged its first Ealing Cricket Club Lawn Tennis Tournament, that was to feature a mixed pairs event won by Blanche Bingley. On 16 September the second Saint Leonards-on-Sea Tournament began at the Archery Gardens, St Leonards-on-Sea, Hastings, East Sussex, England that ended on 18 September. On 24 September the Truro LTC Tournament commenced at Truro, in Cornawall, England. On 1 October 1880 the Sussex County Lawn Tennis Tournament that began on 26 September concluded. At this time 'open' tournaments usually meant men's and women's players can compete.\nAt the 1880 Wimbledon Championships the world's first major tennis tournament, it still remained an all men's event, no women's events were staged. By 1881 for women there was a tennis circuit of sorts starting to form.\nIn 1913 the International Lawn Tennis Federation was created, that consisted of national member associations. The ILTF through its associated members then became responsible for supervising women's tour events.\nResults.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match. The challenge round was used in the early history of tennis (from 1877 through 1921), in some tournaments not all.* Indicates doubles ** mixed doubles\nNotes 2:\"Tournaments in italics were events that were staged only once that season\"\nKey\nJanuary to April.\n\"No events\"\nJuly.\n\"No events\"\nOctober.\nNote: The Sussex County tournament was the autumn edition of the event that featured a women's competition.\nNovember to December.\n\"No events\""

        "title": "1947–48 Dartmouth Indians men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1947–48 Dartmouth Indians men's ice hockey season was the 42nd season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Indians represented Dartmouth College and were coached by Eddie Jeremiah, in his 8th season.\nSeason.\nWith the NCAA instituting a national tournament for the first time for this season, Dartmouth was expected to be one of the two teams selected from the east for the competition. The Indians had won the last four eastern intercollegiate titles contested (one tied) and still boasted many of the players that had helped earn those championships. While the did lose scoring star Jack Riley to graduation, his place in the lineup was filled ably by brother Joe Riley, a transfer from the defunct program at Illinois. Joe was teamed with middle brother and team captain Bill Riley and Bob Merriam to form one of the top scoring lines in the nation and keep Dartmouth atop the college hockey landscape. The defense was also a strength of the team, led by Crawford Campbell and Bob Thayer, while Dick Desmond took on the role as the starter in goal.\nAfter narrowly escaping Boston University in the season opener, Dartmouth settled in and reeled off several dominating victories. During the winter break the club headed to Buffalo and ran roughshod over the other three teams assembled. The Indians ran their hot start to a 7–0 mark before Boston College dented their record. The narrow defeat seemed to spur the team and they responded with several overpowering performances. The greens were, however, able to get their revenge against the Eagles in the rematch and continued their winning ways for the rest of the regular season.\nDartmouth reeled off 13 consecutive wins to finish their slate of game with a 20–1 record and were the obvious choice as the top eastern representative. However, before the beginning of the tournament, Dartmouth still had a few game to play. After the annual alumni game, the Indians headed up to Toronto to take on the eastern Canadian champions, the Toronto Varsity Blues. The northerners handed Dartmouth its worst defeat in eight years and shut out the Indians for the first time since February 1941. Just three days later, the team was in Colorado Springs and having to fight through both fatigue and a mile-high altitude as well as a strong Colorado College outfit. Dartmouth's scorers were not deterred and the team doubled up the nation's top offense to advance to the first national championship game in history.\nThe final game of the season pitted the top teams from each region and Dartmouth would have its hands full against Michigan. While the Wolverines weren't quite as productive on the offensive side as the Indians, their defense was possibly the best in the nation. The title tilt was kicked off by Michigan gaining a lead just 50 seconds into the game. Bill Riley tied the game shortly thereafter and the two then traded goals before the end of the first period to leave the score at 2-all. Dartmouth scored twice in the second period to take a 2-goal lead just past the midway point of the game. With everything appearing to break in the Indians' favor, the second half of the game turned into a tragedy for the greens.\nMichigan cut the lead in half with five minutes remaining in the second. Just over a minute later, Gordon McMillan tied the score but the play was whistled down. Just prior to the goal, Al Renfrew had finished serving a penalty and had returned to the ice rather than his team's bench, as was required by some rules at the time. The referees decided to nullify the goal and the period ended 4–3 in Dartmouth's favor, however, Michigan's coach, Vic Heyliger protested during the intermission. The NCAA rules committee conferred and decided to reverse the decision, officially awarding Michigan the goal and leaving the two tied going into the third. While its unknown how this turn of events affected the team, it was the Wolverines' offense that provided the biggest turning point in the match. Michigan went on a tear in the final frame, scoring three times in the first seven minutes. Dartmouth was unable to respond and all of the shots they fired on goal were turned aside. Michigan finished the game on a 6-goal run and captured the inaugural national championship, much to the chagrin of the Dartmouth faithful.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nScoring statistics.\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Black Bears the University of Maine in the NCAA's America East Conference.\nMaine began competing in intercollegiate basketball in 1904. However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983–84 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985–86 season, but Maine's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons. These lists are updated through the end of the 2021–22 season."

Defending discipline champion Alexis Pinturault of France upset overall slalom discipline leader Marcel Hirscher in the slalom leg to win the first combined of the season at Santa Caterina, Italy. When Hirscher opted to skip the second combined, Pinturault was heavily favored in the race at Wengen, Switzerland as well, but heavy falling snow during the downhill leg (which, for a change, was run last due to the conditions) provided a huge edge to the early starters and led to a shock podium topped by Niels Hintermann of Switzerland, who had never before finished in the top 20 in a World Cup race—and Pinturault only placed 20th after sitting fourth following the slalom leg. Nevertheless, combining that showing with his prior victory was sufficient to give Pinturault the discipline crown (and the crystal globe) for the 2016–17 season.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2017 World Ski Championships, which were held from 6–20 February in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The men's combined (run as a super-combined, with a downhill followed by a slalom) was held on 13 February.\nAt this time, combined races were not included in the season finals, which were scheduled in 2017 in Aspen, Colorado (USA)."

        "text": "The Ukrainian Fencing Federation (Federation d'Escrime d'Ukraine; National Fencing Federation of Ukraine) commonly known by the acronym NFFU, established in 1992, is the governing body of Ukrainian fencing. Through 2022, Ukrainian fencers won 230 medals combined in the Olympic Games, World championships, and European championships.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe federation was established in 1992. It is headquartered in Kyiv, Ukraine.\nAt the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Ukraine performed as an independent team for the first time. It included six athletes participating in individual competitions: Sergei Golubitsky (foil), Vadym Gutzeit (saber), Viktoriya Titova (épée), Yeva Vybornova (épée), and Oleksii Bryzghalov (foil). Golubitsky and Gutzeit took sixth place, and the Ukrainian team took 11th place with 2 points.\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Ukrainian fencers were represented by three teams (foil (h), saber, foil (w), as well as one participant in individual competitions - Oleksandr Horbachuk (épée). Results: foil team (men) - 5th place, saber team - 6th place, foil team - 8th place Golubitsky took 6th place in the individual foil competition, while the rest of the Ukrainian fencers did not make it to the top.\nDuring 2004–08, Ukrainian athletes won seven medals. These are representatives of the young Ukrainian school of fencing: Vladyslav Tretiak (saber), Volodymyr Lukashenko (saber), Oleh Shturbabin (saber), Olha Kharlan (saber), Olena Khomrova (saber), Dmytro Karyuchenko (épée), and Dmytro Chumak (épée).\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Athens, Vladyslav Tretiak won a bronze medal in men's individual sabre.\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics, two types of weapons were supported: women's saber and men's épée. They took part in individual and team competitions and two athletes (Olha Leleiko - foil, Yana Shemyakina - épée) - in individual competitions. The women's saber team led by 17-year-old Olga Kharlan won the gold medal, and the men's épée took 7th place.\nKharlan won the sabre gold medal at the 2009 European Fencing Championships, both in the individual event and the team event with Team Ukraine, in which Ukraine overcame Russia.\nAt the 2009 World Fencing Championships, Anfisa Pochkalova won the bronze medal in the individual épée competition. Kharlan made her way to the women's saber final, only to be stopped by American two-time Olympic champion Mariel Zagunis. In the women's saber team event, Ukraine defeated France in the final to come away with the gold medal. For this performance the Ukrainian team was named team of the year and Kharlan was named athlete of the year at the Ukrainian Heroes of Sports Year ceremony held in April 2010.\nIn the 2009–10 season Kharlan won her fourth Junior World Championship in a row. At the 2010 European Fencing Championships Ukraine won gold in women's saber, after beating Russia in the final.\n2010–19.\nAt the 2010 World Fencing Championships in Paris, Olha Kharlan won the silver medal in the individual women's saber competition, and Olena Khomrova won the bronze medal. In the team competition, 13 female sabers received silver medals. Rostyslav Hertsyk won 7th place in the men's individual foil competition. At the 2010 European Fencing Championships, Team Ukraine won a gold medal in women's sabre, defeating Russia in the final.\nIn the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Kharlan won a bronze medal in the individual women's saber event. Yana Shemyakina became the Olympic champion in women's épée. At the 2012 European Fencing Championships, Kharlan won the gold medal.\nAt the 2013 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Olga Kharlan won the gold medal in the women's individual saber fencing competition, her first individual world championship. The national women's saber team of Ukraine won the gold medal in the team competition, defeating Russia in the finals.\nAt the 2014 European Fencing Championships in Strasbourg, France, Kharlan earned her fourth European gold medal in a row and the fifth of her career.\nAt the 2014 World Fencing Championships in Kazan, Russia, Olga Kharlan became the world champion in the individual women's saber competition. The Ukrainian saber team took third place in the team event, winning a bronze medal. Yana Shemyakina won a bronze medal in the individual épée fencing competition.\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Kharlan bested French competitor Manon Brunet for the bronze medal, and Team Ukraine won the women's sabre silver medal. At the 2018 European Fencing Championships, Team Ukraine won the silver medal in women's sabre.\nAt the 2019 World Fencing Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Kharlan won 15–14 against Russia's Sofya Velikaya in the women’s saber finals; it was Kharlan’s sixth world championship title. At the 2019 European Fencing Championships, Kharlan won the gold medal in women's individual sabre.\n2020–present.\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Ihor Reizlin won a bronze medal in individual men's epee.\nIn July 2023 in Phoenix, Arizona, at the 2023 US Summer Nationals, Ukrainian fencer Darii Lukashenko and tournament sabre champion Konstantin Lokhanov of Russia embraced and held the Ukrainian flag together to express support for Ukrainians during the Russian invasion.\nLater in July 2023, Ukrainian four-time individual world sabre champion Olga Kharlan was disqualified by the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) at the World Fencing Championships in Milan, Italy. Kharlan defeated Russian Anna Smirnova 15-7. Smirnova extended her hand to Kharlan, who in turn extended her saber in an offer to the Russian to tap blades. Kharlan said her choice of salute was meant as a sign of respect for her opponent, while still acknowledging the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. After a long delay during which Smirnova protested and sat on the strip for 45 minutes, Kharlan was ultimately black-carded and eliminated from the championship by FIE officials. The Russian had been allowed to compete as a neutral athlete. The National Fencing Federation of Ukraine filed an appeal. \nRussian Olympic fencer Konstantin Lokhanov, who had denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine and in reaction to it has defected to the United States, said in a \"New York Times\" interview that he thought the Russian fencer might have set a trap for Kharlan, to seek her disqualification. Lokhanov said that on the one hand, the FIE had rules about shaking hands. On the other hand, he noted, the tapping of weapon blades -- in lieu of a handshake -- was the accepted acknowledgment of an opponent during the pandemic, and was still considered suitable by many fencers. Lokhanov said: \"I support Olga. In my opinion she made the right decision. I understand why she made it. But I don’t see any reason why this Russian woman had to make that drama. She could have just touched blades; the bout was over.”\nOn 28 July at the behest of the IOC, the FIE's disqualification of Kharlan was cancelled by the FIE, making it possible for her to enter the team event on 29 July. Kharlan was also told by the IOC that due to the circumstances she was being granted automatic qualification into the 2024 Paris Olympics.\nDuties of organization.\nNFFU, a non-profit organization, is focused on developing fencing in Ukraine by involving broad circles of the population in classes, and increasing the skill level of fencers. The organization holds all-Ukrainian competitions for various ages and levels, and organizes official international fencing competitions in Ukraine and all-Ukrainian sports events, and represents Ukraine fencing at official international fencing competitions. Through 2022, Ukrainian fencers won 230 medals combined in the Olympic Games, World championships, and European championships."

The Terriers represent Boston University and were coached by Harry Cleverly, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nWith the advent of a national tournament for this season, Boston University was one of the eastern teams favored to receive one of the two available bids. The Terriers didn't disappoint early when their offense, led by the top line of Dana Hixon, Irving Haynes and Jack Clopeck, showed up in force. BU scored in bunches and dominated their first four opponents. Their fifth game would be their biggest test, however, as Dartmouth was another prospective tournament hopeful, having won the last four eastern intercollegiate titles. Both teams were the measure of the other in the match and the two heavyweights fought to a draw in regulation. Unfortunately for the Terriers, Dartmouth pulled out the victory in overtime.\nBU responded to their first loss of the season by going on a tear through eastern teams, winning their next four games by wide margins. After a week off the Terriers slowed down a bit but continued to pile up the victories and ran their record to 11–1. The team was hoping to break even with Dartmouth in the rematch, however, the second edition looked eerily similar to the first as the Indians took the match 5–6 in regulation. With the two losses to the greens and Dartmouth being the best team in the east, Boston University would need to win its conference championship if it had any hope of making the tournament.\nTo that point, the Terriers had been undefeated in league play and that trend continued as BU went on a third winning streak. Their final game of the regular season came against rival Boston College and was a rematch of an earlier BU victory. While the game would not affect BU's position in the standings, as they had already guaranteed themselves the NEIHL title, It could still impact the selection committee's decision on who would be the second eastern team. The Eagles, who were now playing with a full complement of players, stunned BU with a 2–9 drubbing and evened the season series. Fortunately, the Terriers had a chance to improve their standing because the NEIHL had instituted a conference tournament this season. BU was set against 3rd-place team Northeastern and were expecting the beat the Huskies for the third time that season, however, BU's defense faltered for the second straight game and the Terriers fell 5–8. The loss all but guaranteed that BU would not be selected for the tournament and the Terriers took their frustration out on Bowdoin in the consolation game, hammering the Polar Bears 18–4 and setting a new program record (since broken) for the most goals scored in one game.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | NEIHL Tournament"

While the Cadets were members of the Pentagonal League, they had gone winless against the other four members the year before and, as a result, only scheduled one game against their four other teams as opposed to the normal two. However, when the Cadets began their season they were performing better than they had in years.\nAfter opening the season with a win, Army defeated Yale in what was considered to be a major upset. Army flagged a bit in their next match, losing to Colgate but then rallied to dominate in two shutout victories, albeit against inferior competition.\nBy the end of January Army was sitting with an enviable record with both of their close losses coming against strong foes. They travelled to Boston for just their second road game of the year and were humbled by Harvard to the tune of 1–7. The Cadets returned to West Point to lick their wounds and then took revenge against a hapless Lehigh squad, nearly equaling the 12–1 drubbing they had handed out the year before.\nIn Army's showdown with Dartmouth, the Cadets faced off against the top team in the nation. Though they lost the match, the fact that they were able to keep the score close indicated just how far they had come.

        "text": "The 2023 Overwatch League season was the sixth season of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional esports league for the video game \"Overwatch 2\". The teams were split between two regions: the East and the West. The season commenced with a preseason pro-am tournament held in the West Region, where Overwatch Contenders teams competed against Overwatch League teams. In the East Region, Overwatch Contenders teams joined the regular season alongside the established Overwatch League teams. The regular season was divided into two stages: Spring and Summer. The Spring stage, which began on April 27, concluded with the Midseason Madness, an interregional midseason tournament hosted in Seoul, South Korea. The Summer stage concluded with play-ins, season playoffs, and the Grand Finals. The playoffs were scheduled to take place at the Mattamy Athletic Centre in Toronto, Canada.\nSeveral teams changed branding and regions for the 2023 season. The Paris Eternal relocated to Las Vegas and rebranded as the Vegas Eternal, becoming the league's first team to switch cities. The Philadelphia Fusion shifted its base to Seoul and rebranded as the Seoul Infernal. The Los Angeles Valiant returned to the West Region after competing in China, while the Dallas Fuel moved from the West to the East Region. Furthermore, the Chengdu Hunters disbanded.\nOverwatch League teams initiated a collective bargaining process, seeking financial assistance to address operating costs and viewership challenges. The teams enlisted the representation of British law firm Sheridans to negotiate with Activision Blizzard. This collective bargaining process led to the agreement between OverActive Media, the owner of the Toronto Defiant, and the Overwatch League. As part of the deal, Toronto Defiant signed a sponsorship agreement with the league, and the Overwatch League agreed to waive the outstanding franchise fees owed by all of the teams.\nLeague format and changes.\nFormat.\nIn contrast to the previous seasons, which were usually split into four stages, the 2023 season was divided into two stages: Spring and Summer. The Spring stage culminated in the Midseason Madness, an interregional midseason tournament. The Summer stage was followed by the play-ins, season playoffs, and Grand Finals. In each stage, the Eastern region was divided into three sections: opens, qualifiers, and knockouts. Overwatch Contenders teams competed in the Opens, Overwatch League teams competed in the qualifiers, and both competed in the knockouts. In the Western region, no Contenders teams competed, and each stage started with qualifiers, with only the Spring stage having knockouts. In the Spring Stage, the top teams from the knockouts advanced to the Midseason Madness.\nRosters construction.\nPrior to the start of the season, all teams were required to have a minimum of six players and a maximum of 12 players signed to season-long contracts. Teams could sign players for a minimum of one season and could add an option to extend that contract for an additional year if they chose to do so. Teams were also allowed to sign players to short-term 30-day contracts, which could only be used on a given player once per season, and two-way contracts. The league reduced the minimum age required to compete from 18 to 17. Additionally, the minimum salary was increased to . The free agency window was initially planned to open on November 19, 2022. However, after the announcement that Blizzard's licensing agreement with NetEase in China would expire on January 23, 2023, the league delayed the beginning of free agency to December 2, 2022. A day before the new start of free agency, the league once again moved back its starting date to December 23.\nTeams and regions.\nSeveral teams relocated for the 2023 season. The Paris Eternal relocated to Las Vegas and rebranded to the Vegas Eternal. With their relocation, they became the first OWL team to relocate to a different city. The relocation also left the London Spitfire as the only European representative in the league. The Philadelphia Fusion also relocated to Seoul and rebranded to the Seoul Infernal, marking the first time that an OWL team has made a full rebrand. Since the 2020 season, the Fusion had been running their operations in South Korea; with the rebrand, the Infernal made Seoul their permanent base of operation. The Los Angeles Valiant, who had been competing out of China in the East Region for the past several seasons, returned to the West Region. The 2022 season champions Dallas Fuel also moved from the West region to the East.\nDue to Blizzard's licensing agreement with NetEase in China ending, which resulted in the four Chinese OWL teams not being legally allowed to play \"Overwatch 2\" in their country, the East Region expanded to allow Contenders teams to compete in the OWL. A total of 12 teams from several Contenders regions played in Spring Stage Opens, and the top teams from the Opens played in the OWL Spring Stage. Moreover, the league announced on April 18, 2023, that the Chengdu Hunters would not play in the Spring Stage qualifiers, as the Hunters were \"[contemplating] the future direction of their team.\"\nPreseason pro-am.\nThe official start to the season was preceded with a pro-am tournament in the West Region that began on March 23, 2023, in which Overwatch Contenders (OWC) teams played against OWL teams. A total of 20 teams — seven OWC teams and the 13 OWL Western Region teams — were split equally into four groups. The top eight teams from the group stage advanced to a single-elimination tournament, and the winner of the tournament will won $100,000.\nOverall standings.\nThe overall standings determined which teams advance to the postseason. Qualification for the postseason is different for the East and West regions. \nEast region.\nQualification for the postseason was determined by average placements in the Spring and Summer knockouts. The top two teams from the East advanced directly to the playoffs, and any OWL teams that were not already in the top two advanced to the play-ins. \nWest region.\nQualification for the postseason was determined by winning percentage in the Spring and Summer qualifiers. The top three teams advanced directly to the season playoffs, while the following seven teams advanced to the play-ins. The remaining two teams that emerged from the play-ins also advanced to the season playoffs, finalizing the 5 teams advancing to the season playoffs.\nRegular season.\nSpring stage.\nThe Spring Split began on April 27, 2023. \nEast region.\nThe Eastern region Spring stage was divided into three sections: opens, qualifiers, and knockouts. The Spring stage began with opens, where Overwatch Contenders teams competed to play in the OWL. The top four teams that make it past the opens joined Overwatch League teams in the Spring Eastern regional knockouts. Then, the Eastern Overwatch League teams competed in the qualifiers; every team advanced past the qualifiers, as they only acted as seeding for the knockouts. All Eastern OWL teams and qualified Contenders teams then competed in the Eastern knockouts. The top two teams from the knockouts advanced to the Midseason Madness.\nWest region.\nThe West region Spring stage was divided into two sections: qualifiers and knockouts. The top two teams from the qualifiers advanced directly to the Midseason Madness, while the following eight advanced to the knockouts. The top two teams from the knockouts also advanced to the Midseason Madness.\nMidseason Madness.\nThe Midseason Madness was a double elimination tournament that was the culmination of the Spring Stage and featured six teams — four from the West and two from the East. The event took place from June 15 to 17 in Seoul, South Korea, at the Korea International Exhibition Center. It marked the first time that the OWL has held a live event in the APAC region.\nSummer stage.\nThe Summer stage began on July 12, 2023.\nEast region.\nSimilar to the Spring stage, the Eastern region Summer stage was divided into three sections: opens, qualifiers, and knockouts. The Summer stage began with opens, where Overwatch Contenders teams competed, and the top teams there advanced to the Summer Eastern regional knockouts. Unlike the Spring stage, both the Eastern Overwatch League teams and Overwatch Contenders teams that competed in the Spring stage knockout also competed in the qualifiers. Every team advanced past the qualifiers, as they only acted as seeding for the knockouts.\nWest region.\nFor the Summer stage, the West region only had qualifiers.\nPostseason.\nPlayoffs.\nFive teams from the West Region and three teams from the East Region advanced to the season playoffs, which took place at the Mattamy Athletic Centre in Toronto, Canada. These teams were divided into groups of four and competed in separate double-elimination brackets over three days. The top two teams from each bracket then entered a four-team, single-elimination Grand Finals bracket. All matches in the Grand Finals bracket were held on October 1, and the winner was crowned the 2023 Overwatch League champion, receiving a trophy and a prize of . Second and third places also earned substantial rewards, with $400,000 and $225,000, respectively. Monetary rewards extended to the sixth-place team.\nAwards.\nRole Stars.\nSource:\nNotable events.\nCollective bargaining and Defiant deal.\nAccording to esports journalist Jacob Wolf, Overwatch League teams retained British law firm Sheridans to start a collective bargaining process against the league, in an attempt to receive financial assistance after several years of high operating costs and low viewership. OverActive Media, the owners of the Toronto Defiant, was leading this collective bargaining effort, as reported by Wolf.\nOn June 5, 2023, OverActive Media announced that Toronto Defiant had signed a sponsorship deal with the league, and the Overwatch League agreed to waive the outstanding franchise fees that OverActive Media had paid to enter the league. The agreement between OverActive Media and the Overwatch League consisted of three distinct components. Firstly, OverActive Media received an early payment of the league revenue share. Secondly, they secured a sponsorship agreement with the Toronto Ultra, their Call of Duty League franchise. Lastly, the Overwatch League eliminated the entry fees, which amounted to . Prior to the deal, it had been reported that the Overwatch League teams collectively owed Activision Blizzard a considerable sum, with each team owing approximately $6 to $7.5million, totaling $120 to $150million. Although OverActive Media's CEO and co-founder, Adam Adamou, stated that it is \"fair to assume that an agreement like this covers all of the teams,\" he did not explicitly confirm whether other teams received the same deal. However, Adamou did acknowledge that the agreement was part of the collective bargaining process. It was later confirmed by \"Sports Business Journal\" that this waiver of outstanding entry fees applied to the entire Overwatch League, not just the Toronto Defiant.\nBlizzard's contract with NetEase expires.\nOn January 24, 2023, Activision Blizzard and NetEase ended their 14-year licensing agreement. With the termination of the agreement, all Activision Blizzard titles that were operated by NetEase, which includes \"Overwatch 2\", went offline in China. This resulted in the four Chinese Overwatch League teams — Chengdu Hunters, Guangzhou Charge, Shanghai Dragons (owned by NetEase), and Hangzhou Spark — no longer being able to play in their home country. Additionally, competitions related to unapproved games in China are not allowed to be broadcast on Chinese live-streaming platforms. While some unapproved games have been broadcast in China in the past, the Chinese government is expected to \"strictly enforce\" this policy as it pertains to Blizzard titles.\nChengdu Hunters disband.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Overwatch League announced that the Chengdu Hunters would not be participating in the 2023 Spring Stage qualifiers, which were scheduled to begin on April 29 in the East Region. This marked the first time in the history of the Overwatch League that a team had effectively dropped out of competition, even temporarily. According to a statement from the Chengdu Hunters posted on social media, the team was contemplating the future direction of their team, leaving open the possibility of their participation in the Summer Stage but providing little concrete information to fans.\nThe situation surrounding the Chengdu Hunters became even more uncertain when on May 4, 2023, \"The Esports Advocate\" reported that the team had disbanded. The Chengdu Hunters were owned by Huya, Inc., a Chinese gaming livestreaming platform. Doubts about the franchise's future first arose in January when the team tweeted about the shutdown of Overwatch 2 in mainland China due to a breakdown in the longstanding relationship between Activision Blizzard and NetEase, the game's Chinese distribution partner. Financial instability may have played a role in the Chengdu Hunters' absence this season. Huya, Inc., facing fluctuating stock prices and reported losses, replaced its board director, potentially leading the organization to reduce esports spending.\nOn June 20, 2023, it was confirmed that the Chengdu Hunters franchise would be officially leaving the Overwatch League. This decision made them the first team to fully exit the league.\nMedia.\nIn early 2020, Activision Blizzard signed a three-year broadcasting rights deal with YouTube, making the streaming platform the exclusive broadcasting partner for the OWL. On April 21, 2023, it was confirmed that the Overwatch League season would continue to be exclusively broadcast on YouTube, despite the expiration of the previous exclusive broadcast rights deal between Blizzard and YouTube. The choice of streaming platform for the 2023 season garnered mixed responses from fans, with some fans expressing disappointment over the exclusive availability on YouTube rather than Twitch.\nPrize pool.\nTeams in the 2023 season competed for a prize pool across the midseason tournament and playoffs, with the payout division detailed below. The Midseason Madness and season playoffs had a prize pool of over ."

        "text": "The 2023 United States Open Championship was the 123rd U.S. Open, the national open golf championship of the United States. It was a 72-hole stroke play played from June 15–18 on the North Course of Los Angeles Country Club in Los Angeles, California. It was the first U.S. Open to be played in Los Angeles since Riviera Country Club hosted the tournament in 1948.\nWyndham Clark, who had never finished better than 75th in a major championship and had missed the cut in his previous two U.S. Opens, shot a final-round 70 to finish at 10-under-par for the tournament and hold off four-time major champion Rory McIlroy by one shot for his first career U.S. Open and major championship .\nRickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele both broke the U.S. Open scoring record by shooting 62 (−8) in the first round. Fowler, who was tied with Clark for the lead at the start of the final round, ended up tied for fifth place, while Schauffele finished 10th.\nCourse.\nOn July 22, 2015, the United States Golf Association (USGA) announced that Los Angeles Country Club was selected to host the 123rd U.S. Open in June 2023. The USGA had made overtures to the club for at least 26 years. Los Angeles Country Club resisted the advances because its leaders valued the privacy of the club. A new group of leaders took over and wanted to show off a renovation of the club's courses done by Gil Hanse that made the courses resemble earlier versions of the courses. More than 90% of the club's members voted to approve the deal that brought the U.S. Open to Los Angeles Country Club.\nThe layout of the Los Angeles Country Club was criticized by 2017 and 2018 U.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, stating he did not believe the course had any \"great\" holes, and a few \"bad\" holes. U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick also criticized the course layout, lamenting the blind tee shots, too much slope and fairways that did not hold the ball. He further elaborated that the slick fairways punished good tee shots which would end up rolling into the rough.\nThe layout of the Los Angeles Country Club limited the number of tickets and grandstand placement for spectators of the U.S. Open. The USGA allotted 22,000 total tickets for the event, with an estimated 8,000 available to the general public and the remainder going to corporate sponsors and club members. The proximity of the ninth green to the eighteenth green limited the placement of grandstands for the final green. The 22,000 tickets per day was below the 2022 total of 30,000 at The Country Club and well below the 50,000 per day at Oakmont Country Club in 2016. Fitzpatrick also criticized the USGA for the limited number of spectators stating he wished the tournament was louder.\nField.\nThe field for the U.S. Open is made up of players who gain entry through qualifying events and those who are exempt from qualifying. The exemption criteria include provisions for recent major champions, winners of major amateur events, and leading players in the world rankings. Qualifying is in two stages, local and final, with some players being exempted through to final qualifying.\nThere were a record 10,187 entries received. There were 109 local qualifying events from which the leading players progressed to the 13 final qualifying events, nine of which were held in the United States on June 5.\nRound summaries.\nFirst round.\n\"Thursday, June 15, 2023\"\nRickie Fowler and Xander Schauffele finished tied for the lead after the first round; their rounds of 62 were the lowest rounds in U.S. Open history and matched the lowest round in any major, set by Branden Grace in the 2017 Open Championship.\nThere were several other scoring records. The first round field scoring average of 71.38 was almost a stroke lower than the previous low first round of 72.29 at Baltusrol Golf Club in 1993. The worst score of the day was 79—the first time either of the first two rounds of a U.S. Open had not seen a score in the 80s.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 16, 2023\"\nRickie Fowler made eight birdies along with six bogeys in a two-under round of 68 to take sole possession of the lead through 36 holes at 10-under for the tournament. Fowler's 18 birdies through the first two rounds was a new U.S. Open record and the most in any two-round stretch of a major championship in 30 years. His total of 130 tied Martin Kaymer in 2014 for the tournament record.\nWyndham Clark, beginning the round two shots off the lead, made three birdies on his first nine after beginning on the 10th, including holing a 44-foot putt on the 16th. At the par-5 14th hole, he hit his second shot into the rough surrounding the lip of a bunker but recovered on his third to 13 feet and made the putt for birdie. He was alone in the lead until a three-putt bogey on the par-3 fourth hole (his 14th) but rebounded with a birdie on the eighth to finish with a 68 (−2) and close within one shot of Fowler's lead.\nRory McIlroy, also teeing off on the 10th to begin his round, was two-over on his first nine before making six birdies on his second nine, including four over his last five holes. He shot 67 (−3) to move up to third place at eight-under, two behind Fowler. \nThe cut came at 142 (+2), with 65 players surviving to the weekend. Among the notables to miss the cut included 2013 champion Justin Rose, 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, and Phil Mickelson. Two-time major champion Justin Thomas shot an 81 to miss the cut by 12 shots.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 2023\"\nThe USGA set up the par-3 15th hole to play at 81 yards for this round, making it the shortest hole in modern U.S. Open history. The previous shortest hole was the 7th hole at Pebble Beach, which played at 92 yards in the final round of the 2010 Open.\nRickie Fowler stood atop the leaderboard for the third consecutive round after shooting an even-par 70. Fowler was leading by one shot at 10-under on the 13th hole when he made a 69-foot birdie putt from just off the green to open a two-shot advantage. He then three-putted for bogey at the 18th to drop back into a share of the lead with Wyndham Clark after 54 holes.\nClark birdied two of his first three holes to take the outright lead before a bogey at the 11th dropped him back into a tie. At the 12th, his second shot flew into the rough over the green, where he failed to advance the ball on his third shot and suffered another bogey. Rebounding with a birdie at the 13th, Clark had to take a drop from an unplayable lie on the 17th hole and made another bogey to fall two back of Fowler playing the 18th. He then hit his approach to the 18th green to six feet and made the birdie to finish at 10-under after a one-under round of 69, tying Fowler for the lead.\nRory McIlroy, the 2011 champion, began the round two shots off the lead but made up the deficit with two birdies on the first three holes to tie. He then bogeyed the fourth hole and three-putted for bogey on the 13th before making birdie on the 14th to get to nine-under and a shot off the lead going into the final round.\nScottie Scheffler was one-over on his round before holing out from 196 yards on the 17th for an eagle. He then finished his round by making a 22-foot putt for birdie on the 18th to get to seven-under for the tournament and end up alone in fourth place.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 18, 2023\"\nSummary.\nWyndham Clark shot an even-par 70 to win his first career U.S. Open and major championship. Beginning the round tied with Rickie Fowler for the lead, he hit his approach shot on the par-3 fourth hole to five feet for a birdie to get to 11-under and take sole possession of the lead. He also birdied the par-4 sixth hole from the rough just short of the green, but at the eighth hole hit his second shot into the rough to the left of the green. He failed to advance the ball on his third shot and ended up with a bogey on the par-five.\nWith a two-shot lead playing the par-5 14th hole, Clark found the green in two shots and two-putted from 20 feet for a birdie to get to 12-under and open up a three-shot lead with four holes to play. He hit his tee shot on the par-3 15th over the green and failed to get up and down, settling for a bogey, then drove into a bunker on the 16th and had to chip back into the fairway. He missed a seven-footer for par to fall back to 10-under, but saved par from left of the green on the 17th. Now with a one-shot lead playing the 18th, Clark two-putted from 60 feet to win the tournament.\nRory McIlroy began the round a shot off the lead and opened with a birdie on the first hole to tie for the lead. This was his last birdie—he did not make another the rest of the round, and bogeyed the 14th after hitting his third shot into the ridge of a bunker and taking a drop for an embedded lie. He finished with 70 to end up at nine-under, a shot back of Clark.\nFowler, tied with Clark at the start of the round, made three bogeys over his first seven holes and did not make a birdie until the eighth, his first since the 13th hole in the third round. His birdie on the 14th was his 23rd of the tournament, establishing a new U.S. Open record. He shot a five-over 75 to fall back into a tie for fifth place with Tommy Fleetwood and Min Woo Lee. \nFleetwood, who began the round in 38th place, made two eagles and was eight-under through 14 holes before a bogey at the 16th. He missed a five-footer for birdie at the 18th for a 62 and settled for a seven-under 63, becoming the first player in U.S. Open history with two rounds of 63 or better (he also posted a seven-under 63 round at the 2018 U.S. Open).\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nSource:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career double plays as a second baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a double play (denoted as DP) is the act of making two outs during the same continuous play. One double play is recorded for every defensive player who participates in the play, regardless of how many of the outs in which they were directly involved, and is counted in addition to whatever putouts and assists might also apply. Double plays can occur any time there is at least one baserunner and fewer than two outs. In baseball and softball, the second baseman is a fielding position in the infield, commonly stationed between second and first base. The second baseman often possesses quick hands and feet, needs the ability to get rid of the ball quickly, and must be able to make the pivot on a double play. In addition, second basemen are almost always right-handed. Only four left-handed throwing players have appeared as second basemen in the major leagues since 1950; one of the four, Gonzalo Márquez, was listed as the second baseman in the starting lineup for two games in 1973, batting in the first inning, but was replaced before his team took the field on defense, and none of the other three players lasted even a complete inning at the position. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4.\nSecond basemen typically record a double play by receiving a throw from another player to force out the runner advancing to second base, then throwing to first base to retire the batter/runner, or by fielding a ground ball and then either throwing to the shortstop covering second base or stepping on the base themselves before the throw to first base is made. Second basemen generally benefit in this respect from playing alongside an excellent shortstop with great range and quickness; strong middle infields are regarded as crucial to a team's defensive play, and double play totals are regarded as a strong indicator of their defensive skill. Double plays are also recorded when the second baseman catches a line drive, then throws to a base before the runner can tag up, or another infielder or the pitcher catches the line drive and then throws to the second baseman in the same situation; on occasion, the throw might come from an outfielder after an unexpected catch of a fly ball. Other double plays occur when the second baseman records an out at second base, then throws out a runner attempting to advance on the basepaths, or on a double steal attempt in which the catcher throws out a runner attempting to steal second base, and the second baseman throws back to the catcher to retire a runner trying to steal home. Double plays are also occasionally recorded when a rundown play is involved, almost always as the second out. Because of the high number of ground outs, second basemen and shortstops typically record far more double plays than players at any other position except first base.\nMost of the career leaders are relatively recent players who have benefitted from improved infield defense, with equipment of better quality; 9 of the top 14 players made their major league debut after 1962, and only two were active before 1945. Longer careers have compensated for the fact that as strikeout totals have risen in baseball, the frequency of other defensive outs including ground outs has declined, with double play totals for second basemen likewise declining; 23 of the top 29 single-season totals were recorded between 1935 and 1974, and none of the top 362 were recorded before 1921. Bill Mazeroski holds the record for the most career double plays by a second baseman with 1,706. Nellie Fox is second with 1,619; only four other second basemen have recorded 1,500 career double plays."

While the scoring was spread out over the lineup, Charley Palms and Jim Smith led the way with 5 points each. The following weekend the team took a trip up to Pennsylvania and took a close meeting from Lehigh. They were supposed to play a rematch with Lafayette during the excursion but the Leopards ended up forfeiting the match. Instead, Georgetown returned home and continued their hot start with a second win over the Engineers.\nWith the team riding high, they headed up to Norwalk, Connecticut, for a two-game series. Unfortunately, the matches only served to show that Georgetown still had a long way to go to be in the same league as the college hockey elites. Afterwards, the team had a long layoff before their next game and they appeared rust in the match against the Baltimore All-Stars. However, Joe Gately stood tall in goal and made 64 saves to lead his team to a victory.\nWhile Georgetown's season wrapped up with the Baltimore win, there were reports that the Hoyas may be invited to participate in an AAU tournament in Buffalo in late March.

        "title": "2016 Alpine Skiing World Cup – Women's overall",
        "text": "The women's overall competition in the 2016 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved 40 events in 5 disciplines: downhill (DH), Super-G (SG), giant slalom (GS), slalom (SL) (which included one city event), and Alpine combined (AC) (which included one super-combined). A city event is a slalom conducted on a two-lane artificial ramp erected in a major city (for example, Stockholm this season, as well as Moscow, Munich, and Oslo); a super-combined (run at Val d'Isère in December 2015) consists of a downhill followed by a one-run slalom, as opposed to an Alpine combined (the other combined race currently contested), which consists of a Super-G followed by a one-run slalom.\nAt the start of the season, the three still-active prior overall women's champions -- two-time defending champion Anna Fenninger of Austria (2014–15), Tina Maze of Slovenia (2013), and Lindsey Vonn of the USA (2008–10, 2012) -- were all inactive. Fenninger had to miss the entire season due to a serious knee injury in October. Maze, an all-discipline skier who had been runner-up behind Fenninger in 2015, took a full-year hiatus before deciding whether to continue or permanently retire. And Vonn was still recovering from, first, her season-ending injury in early 2015, and then a dog bite, and she didn't return until December 2015. Then, in early December, just a handful of events into the season, Mikaela Shiffrin of the USA, overall fourth last season and slalom discipline champion for the last three seasons, suffered an injury during practice at Åre, which caused her to miss the two months at the heart of the season; she did not return until mid-February (and promptly dominated the competition, although it was too late to contend for the season crown).\nWith all of the injuries, Vonn, who herself missed more time due to injuries in late December, nevertheless had opened a narrow lead in the overall standings. When the World Cup went to Andorra in late February, Vonn had already won the Downhill discipline for the season and was leading in the Overall, Super-G and Combined disciplines for the season. However, on February 27, during the Super-G in Soldeu, Vonn crashed again near the end of her run while leading. She still raced the next day in the Combined event, although failing to podium, but on Monday a complete medical evaluation in Barcelona revealed multiple significant (not hairline, as she had thought) fractures in her knee from the Super-G crash, which ended her season at once.\nAfter Vonn's injury, 24-year-old Lara Gut of Switzerland, Vonn's closest pursuer, grabbed the overall lead and ended up as the season champion by almost 300 points.\nAppropriately, the World Cup season finals were held in St. Moritz, Switzerland for the first time since the World Cup season finals began in 1993, although five of the previous eleven finals were held in Switzerland (all at Lenzerheide)."

        "title": "Argentina v Peru (1978 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "Argentina v Peru was a football match between Argentina and Peru that took place on 21 June 1978 during the 1978 FIFA World Cup within Group B. In order to advance to the knockout stage and beat Brazil by goal difference, Argentina needed to win by four goals. The match ended 6–0 in an Argentine victory with two goals from Mario Kempes, two goals from Leopoldo Luque, one goal by Alberto Tarantini and one from René Houseman. The 1978 World Cup would go on to end in Argentina earning their first championship title after beating the Netherlands 3–1. The match remains to be one of the most controversial in World Cup history as it's been speculated that there has been some collusion in favor of Argentina. This was due to the World Cup taking place during the military dictatorship of the National Reorganization Process under Jorge Rafael Videla which in turn lead to speculation that the World Cup was an attempt to appease the population in the face of human rights violations.\nSeveral national football players, journalists and politicians have given different interpretations over a possible outside interference within the match to benefit Argentina with no consensus on the circumstances. The denunciation of the former Argentine Minister of Finance, Juan Alemann who claimed that a bomb detonated when Argentina scored the fourth goal needed to qualify. Players of the Peruvian national football team have given different versions of what happened as some alleged that irregular things happened before and during the match such as the visit of the Argentine dictator Videla to the Peruvian locker room while others deny any type of arrangement and claim that Argentina was vastly superior to Peru during the match.\nFIFA arranged for the Brazil-Poland match to be played before Argentina-Peru, citing television and ticket sales issues. Match times had been agreed long before the start of the World Cup. Brazil objected to the measure, since the Albiceleste team would know in advance the number of goals they had to score. FIFA generally held the matches of the same group on different days or times, but neither was it unusual for matches of the same group to be played simultaneously. After the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the defining group matches would be played simultaneously after the Disgrace of Gijón, another World Cup controversy.\nIn 2012 it was rumored that FIFA could investigate the matter, and if it found evidence that an arrangement existed, it could annul the title to Argentina. But there were no major attempts by FIFA in this regard.\nBackground.\nArgentina.\nArgentina was runner-up in the 1930 FIFA World Cup held in Uruguay where the host country won the title 4–2. After that, the furthest Argentina had gone in a World Cup was the quarterfinals at the 1966 FIFA World Cup held in England when Argentina lost 0–1 against England when Antonio Ubaldo Rattín was sent off after insulting the referee despite the fact that he did not understand Spanish. Regardless, Argentina qualified in all World Cups except for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico and declined to participate in 1938, 1950 and 1954. Due to being the hosts of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, Argentina did not have to qualify.\nArgentina had also won the Copa América in 1921, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1937, 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955, 1957 and 1959 and the champions of the 1960 Panamerican Championship and runners-up in 1916, 1917, 1920, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1935, 1942, 1959 extra (South American championship) and 1967. At the Olympic Games, the senior team achieved its greatest achievement at the 1928 Summer Olympics, winning the silver medal (after losing the gold medal also for the Uruguay).\nPeru.\nPeru participated in the 1930 FIFA World Cup but was left out in the first phase. They wouldn't participate again until the 1970 FIFA World Cup where they obtained the Fair Play Award reached the quarterfinals losing against the champion, Brazil by 2:4, to this day it was the furthest that Peru had reached in a World Cup. In 1978 they qualified again for a World Cup, after failing to qualify in the 1974 edition .\nPeru was crowned champion of the Copa América on 1939 and 1975. On the other hand, Peru competed twice in the Olympic Games and obtained the gold medal in the Bolivarian Games in 1938, 1947, 1961, 1973 and 1981.\nPeruvian Qualification for the 1978 World Cup.\nDuring the finals, Peru lost against Brazil by one goal but managed to beat Bolivia 5–0, allowing Peru to reach second place and successfully qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup.\nRecent Match History Between Argentina and Peru.\nMatches prior to the World Cup stood out, with César Luis Menotti as technical director of Argentina. All of them ended in victory for the Argentines. These are four matches for the , a friendly tournament that was played between the two teams.\n1978 FIFA World Cup.\nQualification for Group B.\nArgentina.\nArgentina qualified second in their group after beating Hungary and France 2:1 . For the third game, Argentina was already qualified together with Italy. The third and last game of the group was Italy-Argentina, which ended with a 1:0 victory for the Italians.\nPeru.\nPeru qualified first in their group by getting a 3–1 victory against Scotland, a 0–0 draw against the Netherlands and a 4–1 victory against Iran.\nGroup B.\nArgentina had qualified for the second group stage after obtaining second place in Group 1 behind Italy while Brazil had also obtained the second position of Group 3 after Austria. Both Peru and Poland had achieved first place in Group 4 and Group 2 respectively. The headquarters of this group were Mendoza and Rosario.\nThe first game pitted Brazil against Peru, ending with a 3–0 victory for the Brazilians. Argentina also beat Poland 2–0 in Rosario with two goals from Mario Kempes. The victory of Poland over Peru by 1-0 and the goalless draw between Argentina and Brazil left a group close in which, with the exception of Peru, the other three teams had a chance to reach the final. Argentina and Brazil reached the last game with 3 points, although the Brazilians had a greater goal difference. Poland arrived with 2 points but with chances to win the group if, after their victory, Argentina lost or tied without surpassing it in goal difference.\nThe matches were not played at the same time but Brazil and Poland played first at 16:45 while Argentina and Peru did so later, at 19:15. Brazil won their match 3–1, with two goals from Roberto Dinamite and one from Nelinho. With this result he finished with 5 points and +5 goal difference. In order to reach the final, Argentina had to win with a margin of four goals since they had a goal difference of +2. Argentina managed to prevail over Peru by 6-0 and thus qualify for the final.\nControversy.\nThe game was played on June 21 and it was the last turn of Group B of the second phase. Argentina came at a disadvantage against Brazil with the same points but with a goal-less difference. FIFA ordered that Brazil should play first against Poland and Argentina then against Peru. This gave the Argentine team an advantage, knowing in advance how many goals would be needed to reach the final. In January, FIFA had resolved in meetings prior to the draw for the venues that Argentina would play its first-round matches and in the event of qualifying, the second phase would always play at 7:15 p.m. while the others, except for the opening match and the final, at 1:00 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. Given the few ticket sales abroad, FIFA feared that in those matches where the local team was not involved, there would be low attendance. Therefore, if Argentina's matches were played simultaneously with others, the public that did not go to see Argentina on the field, would stay at home and watch the matches on television. At the time, no one had filed opposition to this measure. West Germany enjoyed a similar benefit in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. When it came time for the decisive group matches however, the Brazilians pushed to play their game against Poland at the same time as Argentina against Peru but FIFA objected. Its managers argued that it was impossible to change schedules on television. Thus Brazil played its game and won 3–1, forcing Argentina to win by a four-goal difference. Knowing this, Argentina played in the second turn against Peru, who were already out of the World Cup by not reaping any points within the group. Minutes before the game, President Jorge Rafael Videla visited the Peruvian locker room accompanied by former American Secretary of State and organizer of Operation Condor, Henry Kissinger and read a message to the players from the Peruvian dictator Francisco Morales Bermúdez on the Argentine-Peruvian brotherhood. Argentina finally obtained a historic result of 6–0, defeating Brazil on goal difference and agreeing to play the final against the Netherlands.\nSome years later, the result and some particular circumstances during the game raised suspicions about the legitimacy of the match. Upon returning to Lima, the Peruvian team met an angry mob who threw coins, tomatoes and other objects at them as recounted by Peruvian player Guillermo La Rosa. Ten days after the end of the World Cup, on July 6, 1978, the Argentine dictatorship sanctioned Decree No. 1463/78 \"granting an extraordinary non-refundable credit to the Republic of Peru.\" There were also versions that Brazil had given an economic incentive to the Peruvian players to beat Argentina, a rumor that would be defended by the Argentine player Mario Kempes as well as by the Peruvian players Teófilo Cubillas and Héctor Chumpitaz who admitted that they were going to receive a $5,000 incentive each. At the same time, there were rumors that local leaders gave Poland incentives to beat Brazil. Kempes denied that there could have been any agreement since Peru had some clear arrivals, including a vertical shot from the Argentine goal. Another factor of the Peruvian decline was that each match was played every three days which wore out the Peruvian team, not used to the amount of consistent playing. In addition to this, an internal division began to emerge in the Peruvian national football team between the players of Sporting Cristal and Alianza Lima.\nDifferent people and players declared that part of the Peruvian team was pressured or bribed to lose the game by a large sum. Others, based on recent investigations, suggest that there was an agreement between the two governments within the framework of Operation Condor. Years later Videla would deny any type of arrangement, stating: \"I didn't take a peso out of my pocket. There was no talk of a possible arrangement before the game, neither in the Government, nor in the Junta.\"\nIn the book \"How They Stole the Game\", the British historian David Yallop maintained that Videla ordered Rear Admiral Carlos Alberto Lacoste, in charge of EAM'78, to take charge of arranging the result with the ruling dictatorship in Peru, led by General Morales Bermúdez, 23 who decades later would be sentenced to life imprisonment by the III Criminal Court of Rome, for his participation in Operation Condor. According to Yallop, Lacoste made contact with three officials who accompanied the Peruvian team and offered them a million-dollar bribe of fifty million dollars and a donation of 35,000 tons of grains. After the World Cup, the Treasury Secretary of the dictatorship, Juan Alemann confirmed the Argentine \"donations\" made to Peru and explained that they were a type of donations that were only made in cases of humanitarian catastrophes.\nThe businessman and former Secretary of the Treasury, Juan Alemann denounced in 1982 that Vice Admiral Carlos Alberto Lacoste had been the mastermind of an attack with an explosive device at Alemann's home, when on June 21, 1978, at the precise moment in which Argentina scored the fourth goal against Peru that gave it a pass to the final, a bomb exploded in the house of the then Secretary of Finance Juan Alemann and Lacoste for overpricing in the organization of the tournament. Alemann blamed Massera himself for the attack:\nOn December 12, 2007, the Argentine journalist Ezequiel Fernández Moores interviewed Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón, capo of the Cali Cartel led by his uncle Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela who gave a detailed account of the way in which the bribery would have been carried out. He recounted what his uncle revealed to him, as he served as a mediator with Peruvian officials at the request of the Argentine military. According to Rodríguez Mondragón, the Argentine and player representative Carlos Quieto told Rodríguez Orejuela that the Argentine military and the Argentine Football Association (AFA) wanted to meet in reserve with the authorities of the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF), with which the Colombian drug lord maintained close relations. The meeting would have been held in Miraflores, Lima the next day, two days before the game and the captain of the ship \"Lacoste\" and two other people participated on behalf of Argentina with the president and treasurer of the FPF representing Peru. According to Rodríguez Mondragón, there it was agreed to pay the bribes to the Peruvian players and leaders and the donation of wheat which had already been requested.\nSeveral players of the Peruvian team maintained that, in their opinion, suspicious irregularities or bribery had taken place. In 1986, Juan Carlos Oblitas declared to the press that he felt \"ashamed\", then stating that he thought that \"this match was not normal\". In 2003, Oblitas announced that the dictator Videla and the former American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had been present in the Peruvian locker room, a few minutes before starting the game. In 2018, two starting players of the 1978 Peruvian team, José Velásquez and Germán Leguía had also declared that Videla and Kissinger entered the Peruvian locker room and read a message from the Peruvian dictator Morales Bermúdez to the players. Both former players declared that the visit was interpreted by the Peruvian team as a threat. Velásquez also said that although he lacked evidence, he knew several Peruvian managers and six players who participated to fix the match, naming Rodulfo Manzo, Raúl Gorriti, Juan José Muñante and Ramón Quiroga with the latter being born in Argentina. In an investigation carried out by Fernández Moores for Radio Continental, journalist Carlos Juvenal said that the captain of the Peruvian squad, Héctor Chumpitaz confessed to him about \"additional money\" but added that he would never admit it publicly.\nThe accused players have denied the claims, pointing out that they lacked evidence. Quiroga accused Velásquez of having a \"lack of sanity\" and responded with \"I did not sell myself. If I had taken money to go back, today I could not walk through Lima and I do it without problems.\" He also added that:\nDespite this, on another occasion Quiroga has pointed out that that day some of his teammates had acted \"strange\" in the game, such as defender Rodulfo Manzo, who ducked in the fourth Argentine goal, for which Quiroga points out that: \"'Negro' Manzo didn't stop anything, neither he nor the defense. In Argentina's fourth goal, Manzo ducked and left the shooter alone.\" In addition, the unusual lineup of Peruvian coach Marcos Calderón stood out who left several notable and experienced players out of the match. In his response, Muñante stated that Velásquez \"was delusional\" and that Calderón didn't accept any bribes. Muñante also recounted that they didn't ask the Peruvian technical director not to line up goalkeeper Quiroga, an Argentine nationalized Peruvian, and clarified that there was a meeting in which Quiroga was asked if he wanted to save with his agreement. Muñante asserted that no player missed out since Peru was able to score two or three goals against Argentina in the first 15 minutes. Manzo maintained that neither he nor his teammates had received money for the result of the match and even though there have been speculations, there has never been any real proof of any fraud. Katia Gorriti, Gorriti's daughter, stated that Velásquez's opinions were disrespectful and unfair as they stained her father's name, also indicating that she would take legal action.\nOther leading players in the match denied any bribery or match fixing and argued that there is no evidence to support the stories, which speak of corruption and agreements. Héctor Chumpitaz, captain of Peru, declared that his team was never sold. Jaime Duarte stated that \"for 29 years they have been coming up with new stories and that there is no evidence to prove such bribes.\" César Cueto declared that this match was legitimate, and that the defeat was due to poor physical preparation and fatigue after eleven days of competition, describing the accusations as \"press inventions\". Teófilo Cubillas declared that there was no arrangement and denied the rumors. He also stated that if they had played three times in those months, Argentina would have thrashed them again since shortly before Ecuador had also scored six goals against them and that Argentina itself had easily beaten them in another friendly. According to Cubillas, Peru \"was going down\" after losing to Brazil and Poland and that although they had won their group in the first phase of the Cup, the team was not doing well, unlike the Argentine team, which he described as \"a waterspout that came upon us\". Finally, Cubillas considered it absurd to think that Argentina sent tons of wheat to Peru, repaying the fact. He further added to his previous comments, stating that:\nReactions from the Argentine players have been more aware of Videla's dictatorship with Leopoldo Luque stating \"With what I know now, I can't say I am proud of my victory... but I didn't realize, most of us didn't. We just played football.” Similarly, Ricardo Villa commented “There is no doubt we were used politically.”\nIn 2020, Dutch player Johnny Rep and Brazilian player Roberto Dinamite stated that the match had probably been arranged to \"reassure the population\".\nFormer Peruvian senator Genaro Ledesma Izquieta denounced that the party's supposed arrangement was carried out during the Peruvian dictatorship under the condition that Videla would release 13 Peruvian political prisoners, this operation would have been part of the Operation Condor. In 2012, after statements by former legislator Ledesma, it was rumored that FIFA could annul Argentina's title in 1978 if it was proven that there was an arrangement in their match against Peru but the case hasn't gone any further. In an article published in 2018, the Peruvian journalist Valentín Ahón stated that he didn't believe that there were bribes or a pact between the dictatorships of Argentina and Peru.\nIn Popular Culture.\nThe match is mentioned in the song \"La argentinidad al palo\" by Argentine rock band Bersuit Vergarabat, mentioning \"the 6 to 0 at Peru\" among Argentina's several \"achievements\" in the form of a critical parody."

South Africa won the match 12 - 8.\nThe same 4 Scotland internationals that played the match were invited to play for London Counties in a return match against South Africa on 16 November 1912. However at this point the London clubs were getting frustrated by the number of representative matches their players had to face and the Scotland internationals thus took a stand and declined that invitation.\nThe \"Scottish Referee\" newspaper of 18 November 1912 noted:\nA LONDON-SCOTTISH PROTEST. Trouble has been brewing for some time in Metropolitan Rugby circles (says the \"Sporting Life\") and the action of the London Scottish forwards declining to play for London Counties against the South Africans is calculated to bring it to a head. The London clubs, with all their loyalty to the Union, have resented the introduction of so many representative matches at headquarters on Saturdays. Not without reason do they contend that the Springboks' fixtures might reasonably have been arranged for the mid-week, when they would not have clashed with the club games. For Saturday's match four of the London Scottish forwards —L. Robertson, R. D. Robertson, C. Usher, and W. D. C. L. Purves, all internationalists — were invited to play for London. They declined the honour by way of a protest. The London Scottish committee left their players free choice in the matter, though holding the opinion that the time has come when London club football should insist on more consideration in the matter of club fixtures. In their stand they have made they have the sympathy of practically all the Metropolitan Rugby clubs. Interviewed by a press representative; Mr. R. D. Robertson, the hon. secretary of the London Scottish club, said the action of the Scottish forwards in declining to play against the South Africans was in the first place due to their desire to play for their club against the Harlequins, and also as a protest against playing so many matches of a similar nature on Saturday at the expense of London club football.\nInternational career.\nHe was to play in only 1 international match, which was against France in 1912. He was not originally selected to play, but due to his London Scottish teammate Lewis Robertson who was originally selected for Scotland being unable to play in the match due to the death of his father, Robert was then drafted in as a replacement.\nAdministrative career.\nAs noted above, Robertson became the Honorary Secretary of the London Scottish club. He proposed that Duggie Lyall Grant succeed him in office in 1913.\nMilitary career.\nHe joined the Gordon Highlanders in 1911. During the First World War, Robertson was a captain in the Gordon Highlanders. Initially reported as missing in action in 1914 and presumed dead, he was later found to be wounded in battle and captured. He became later part in a prisoner swap deal with Germany in 1915 and thus made his way back to the United Kingdom. He was later promoted to Major.\nFamily.\nHe married Lucy Helen Jervois (1886-1969) in September 1933."

        "text": "John Hume (17 March 1890, Edinburgh – 20 December 1969, Leeds) was a Scotland international rugby union player.\nRugby Union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe played for Royal HSFP.\nHe played for Headingley from October 2021 and he captained the side that first season.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Edinburgh District in their match against Glasgow District on 2 December 1911. In 1920, he turned out for Edinburgh District again in the same fixture.\nHe was then picked to play for Whites Trial in their match against Blues Trial on 6 January 1912.\nThe following season he was involved in the Combined Scottish Districts match against South Africa on 27 November 1912 and the final trial and turned out for Scotland Possibles against Scotland Probables on 18 January 1913.\nHe played for Cities District against Provinces District on 11 December 1920.\nThe same season, he turned out for Provinces District in their match against Scottish Exiles on 25 December 1920. The \"Sunday Post\" of 26 December 1920 noting:\nAs half Hume again had almost a field day, and to his fine rooting and service the Home threes owed their chance to make good. Realising fairly early that Simpson was too selfish to be any help to his backs, Hume time and again slung the ball well out to Wilson or Mackenzie, a policy which paid. Whether getting the ball, spoiling, or kicking, Hume was equally excellent.\nHis form got him promoted finally to the Scotland Probables side on 8 January 1921 in the final trial match.\nInternational career.\nHe was capped 7 times for Scotland between 1912 and 1922.\nIn 1922 Hume retired from international rugby.

        "title": "2023 Major League Baseball postseason",
        "text": "The 2023 Major League Baseball postseason was the playoff tournament of Major League Baseball (MLB) for the 2023 season. The winners of the Wild Card Series faced the two best division winners (seeds) in each league in the Division Series, and the victors advanced to the League Championship Series to determine the pennant winners who played each other in the 2023 World Series. The postseason began on October 3 and ended on November 1.\nIn the American League, the Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers returned to the postseason for the first time since 2016. The Houston Astros made their seventh straight postseason appearance and the eighth in the past nine seasons, marking the first time since 2015 that both Texas teams made the postseason. The Minnesota Twins made their fourth postseason appearance in the past seven seasons. The Toronto Blue Jays returned to the postseason for the third time in the past four seasons, and the Tampa Bay Rays returned for the fifth consecutive season.\nIn the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers clinched their eleventh straight postseason berth, which is currently the longest active streak in the majors and in professional sports. The Atlanta Braves clinched the best record in the majors and made their sixth straight postseason appearance. The Milwaukee Brewers returned to the postseason for the fifth time in the past six seasons. The Miami Marlins returned to the postseason for the second time in the past four seasons. The Philadelphia Phillies made their second straight postseason appearance, and the Arizona Diamondbacks returned for the first time since 2017.\nThe only division winner to advance to the League Championship Series were the Houston Astros (AL West), following the defeat of the Milwaukee Brewers (NL Central) by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a sweep, in the Wild Card Series, then the defeats of the Minnesota Twins (AL Central) by the Houston Astros in four games, Baltimore Orioles (AL East) by the Texas Rangers in a sweep, Los Angeles Dodgers (NL West) by the Arizona Diamondbacks in a sweep, and the Atlanta Braves (NL East) by the Philadelphia Phillies in four games, in the Division Series. This also means that it was the first time in Major League Baseball postseason history that the last four remaining teams in the League Championship Series had 90 or fewer regular season wins.\nThe postseason began on October 3 and ended on November 1, with the Rangers defeating the Diamondbacks in the 2023 World Series to clinch their first title in franchise history.\nTeams.\nThe three division winners in each league and the top three non-division winners in each league qualified for the playoffs. The top two division winners receive byes to the American League Division Series (ALDS) or National League Division Series (NLDS) while the other teams who qualify for the playoffs play in the wild card series.\nThe following teams qualified for the postseason:\nPlayoff bracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nAmerican League Wild Card Series.\n(3) Minnesota Twins vs. (6) Toronto Blue Jays.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Blue Jays and Twins. They last met in the 1991 ALCS, which was won by the Twins en route to a World Series title. Minnesota ended 21 years of futility, sweeping Toronto to win their first playoff series since 2002. It also marked the end of their long streak of playoff game losses, which stood at 18 consecutive losses, the longest in North American sports history.\nThe Twins' streak of 18 consecutive playoff game losses was ended in Game 1, as Royce Lewis hit two home runs in his first two at-bats to lead the Twins to a 3–1 victory. It was the Twins' first playoff game win since Game 1 of the 2004 ALDS against the New York Yankees. In Game 2, Sonny Gray out-dueled Toronto's José Berríos and Yusei Kikuchi as the Twins won in a 2–0 shutout to win their first playoff series in 21 years.\nWhile the Blue Jays were the sixth seed, the series result was considered an upset as the Blue Jays (89–73) finished with a better record than the Twins (87–75). Toronto was awarded the sixth seed under the new playoff format, which guarantees division winners a top-3 seed.\n(4) Tampa Bay Rays vs. (5) Texas Rangers.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Rays and Rangers. The previous two meetings (2010 and 2011) were won by the Rangers. The Rangers swept the Rays to advance to the ALDS for the first time since 2016.\nThe Rangers held the Rays to one run scored in the series. Jordan Montgomery pitched seven shutout innings as the Rangers took Game 1 by a 4–0 score. Game 1 was notable for several stats – the Rays committed four errors, setting a single-game playoff franchise record and the most in a postseason game since the New York Yankees committed four errors in Game 4 of the 2019 ALCS. It was also notable for the record low attendance at Tropicana Field, as there was only 19,704 in attendance – the lowest attended postseason game (non-COVID-19 year) since Game 7 of the 1919 World Series. Nathan Eovaldi pitched a solid 6 innings in Game 2 as the Rangers blew out the Rays by a 7–1 score to complete the sweep and advance.\nWith the win, the Rangers improved their postseason record against the Rays to 3–0, previously winning in 2010 and 2011.\nNational League Wild Card Series.\n(3) Milwaukee Brewers vs. (6) Arizona Diamondbacks.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Brewers and Diamondbacks. They previously met in the 2011 NLDS, which was won by the Brewers in five games. The Diamondbacks upset the Brewers in a sweep, returning to the NLDS for the first time since 2017.\nThe Diamondbacks stunned the Brewers with a come-from-behind victory in Game 1 – the Brewers led 3–0 after the first two innings, until Arizona's Corbin Carroll, Ketel Marte, and Gabriel Moreno all hit home runs across the top of the third and fourth innings to put the Diamondbacks in the lead for good. In Game 2, the Brewers again jumped out to an early lead and had a no-hit bid going into the top of the fifth, until Arizona's Alek Thomas hit a solo home run to end it. Then the Diamondbacks rallied to win again, as Carroll doubled and Marte hit a two-RBI single to put Arizona in the lead, and then a wild pitch and then a blooper scored the next two runs.\n(4) Philadelphia Phillies vs. (5) Miami Marlins.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Marlins and Phillies. The Phillies swept the Marlins to advance to the NLDS for the second year in a row.\nThe Phillies’ pitching staff held the Marlins’ offense to one run scored in both games. Zack Wheeler gave up one run and struck out eight Marlins over 6 strong innings as the Phillies won 4–1 in Game 1. Aaron Nola pitched seven strong innings in Game 2 as the Phillies blew out the Marlins by a 7–1 score, capped off by Bryson Stott's grand slam in the bottom of the sixth.\nAmerican League Division Series.\n(1) Baltimore Orioles vs. (5) Texas Rangers.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Orioles and Rangers. They last met in the 2012 AL Wild Card Game, which was won by the Orioles. The Rangers upset the heavily favored Orioles in a sweep, returning to the ALCS for the first time since 2011.\nThe Rangers held off a late push by the Orioles to take Game 1 on the road, capped off by Josh Jung's solo home run in the top of the sixth. Game 2 was an offensive slugfest which the Rangers won 11–8, in part thanks to a third-inning grand slam hit by Mitch Garver. Nathan Eovaldi pitched seven solid innings in Game 3 as the Rangers blew out the Orioles by a 7–1 score to complete the sweep.\n(2) Houston Astros vs. (3) Minnesota Twins.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Astros and Twins. They last met in the 2020 AL Wild Card Series, which was won by the Astros in a two-game sweep. The Astros once again defeated the Twins, this time in four games, to return to the ALCS for the seventh year in a row.\nThe Astros held on to win Game 1 by a 6–4 score, as their bullpen held off a late rally by the Twins. Game 1 was notable for Justin Verlander's six shutout innings pitched for the sixth scoreless start of his postseason career, tying Madison Bumgarner and Tom Glavine for most all-time. In Game 2, Pablo López pitched seven solid innings for the Twins, as they jumped out to a big lead early and didn't relinquish it, winning 6–2 to even the series headed to Minneapolis. Game 2 marked the end of the Astros' 12-game home winning streak in the ALDS, and it was also their first loss in Game 2 of the LDS since the second game of the 2015 ALDS against the Kansas City Royals. Cristian Javier pitched five scoreless innings in Game 3 as the Astros blew out the Twins by a 9–1 score to regain the series lead. In Game 4, the Astros held off a late rally by the Twins to win by a 3–2 score and return to the ALCS.\nThis marked the seventh consecutive loss for the Twins in the ALDS, as they previously lost in 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2019. Their most recent ALDS series win came in 2002, where they defeated the Oakland Athletics in five games before falling in the ALCS to the then-Anaheim Angels.\nNational League Division Series.\n(1) Atlanta Braves vs. (4) Philadelphia Phillies.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Braves and the Phillies. They previously met in the 1993 NLCS and 2022 NLDS, both of which were won by the Phillies. This series was a rematch of last year's NLDS, which the Phillies won in four games. The Phillies once again defeated the Braves in four games to return to the NLCS for the second consecutive season.\nThe outcome of this series was nearly identical to the previous year's match. The Phillies stole Game 1 on the road in a 3–0 shutout. In Game 2, the Braves overcame a late deficit in the seventh and eighth innings to even the series, thanks to a pair of two-run home runs from Travis d'Arnaud and Austin Riley. However, when the series shifted to Philadelphia, things again got ugly for the Braves. The Phillies blew out the Braves by a 10–2 score in Game 3, thanks to multiple home runs from Nick Castellanos, Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and Brandon Marsh. Castellanos and Turner both homered again for the Phillies in Game 4 as they held on to win by a 3–1 score.\nWith the win, the Phillies improved their postseason record against the Braves to 3–0, previously winning in 1993 and 2022.\n(2) Los Angeles Dodgers vs. (6) Arizona Diamondbacks.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Dodgers and Diamondbacks. They previously met in the 2017 NLDS, which was won by the Dodgers in a sweep.\nIn a significant upset given their regular season win differential, the 84-win Diamondbacks swept the 100-win Dodgers, reaching the NLCS for the first time since 2007. This series was a reverse of the 2017 NLDS, where the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks.\nThe Diamondbacks jumped out to a big lead in the top of the first, as their first five batters scored, highlighted by a three-run home run from Gabriel Moreno. The Dodgers' ace Clayton Kershaw was pulled after giving up an RBI double to Evan Longoria, which extended Arizona's lead to 6–0. Game 1 was the shortest start of Kershaw's career, as he recorded just one out. The Diamondbacks blew out the Dodgers by an 11–2 score to steal Game 1 on the road. In Game 2, the Diamondbacks again jumped out to a big early lead and held off a late rally by the Dodgers to win 4–2, capped off by an insurance home run by Lourdes Gurriel Jr. in the top of the sixth. When the series shifted to Phoenix, the Diamondbacks once again jumped out to a 4–0 lead early, thanks to four solo home runs from Moreno, Geraldo Perdomo, Ketel Marte, and Christian Walker respectively. The 2023 Diamondbacks became the first team in postseason history to hit four home runs in a single inning. The Diamondbacks would hold on to win by a 4–2 score, completing an improbable upset.\nAmerican League Championship Series.\n(2) Houston Astros vs. (5) Texas Rangers.\nThis was the first postseason meeting in the history of the Rangers–Astros rivalry, and the first ever LCS to feature two teams from the same state. This was the seventh straight ALCS appearance for the Astros, dating back to 2017. Despite blowing a 2–0 series lead, the Rangers held on to defeat the defending World Series champion Astros in seven games to return to the World Series for the first time since 2011.\nJordan Montgomery and the Rangers' bullpen shut down the Astros offense in Game 1 as they prevailed in a 2–0 shutout. Game 2 would also go the Rangers' way, as despite Yordan Álvarez's efforts to erase their lead, they would hold on by one run to take a 2–0 series lead back to Arlington. Things would then take a turn for the worst for the Rangers in Game 3. Max Scherzer had one of his worst postseason starts, as he gave up four runs across the second and third innings in an 8–5 Astros win. The Astros then blew out the Rangers in Game 4 to even the series at two. Game 4 was notable for being José Altuve's 100th career postseason game. In Game 5, the Rangers had a two-run lead going into the ninth, until Altuve hit a three-run home run that put the Astros ahead for good and gave them a 3–2 series lead headed back to Houston, putting the Astros one win away from a third straight World Series appearance. However, their lead would not hold going back home. Adolis García, Mitch Garver, and Jonah Heim all hit home runs in Game 6 as the Rangers blew out the Astros to force a seventh game, capped off by García's grand slam in the top of the ninth inning. In the Rangers' first-ever ALCS Game 7, García once again took center stage, as he along with Corey Seager and Nathaniel Lowe blew out the Astros again and secured the pennant.\nWith the win, the Rangers improved their record in the ALCS to 3–0, previously winning in 2010 and 2011. They also became the second fifth-seeded team in MLB history to reach the World Series, joining the 2014 San Francisco Giants, who were also managed by Bochy.\nNational League Championship Series.\n(4) Philadelphia Phillies vs. (6) Arizona Diamondbacks.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Phillies and the Diamondbacks. This was also the second straight NLCS to feature two wild-card teams. Since 2022 when the postseason got expanded, the only lower-seeded League Championship Series played was the 2022 NLCS (between the fifth and sixth seeds). The Diamondbacks overcame both a 2–0 and 3–2 series deficit to defeat the defending National League champion Phillies and return to the World Series for the first time since 2001.\nIn Game 1, the Phillies chased Arizona starter Zac Gallen from the mound early, and held off a late rally by the Diamondbacks to win 5–3. The Phillies then blew out the Diamondbacks in Game 2 to take a 2–0 series lead headed to Phoenix. The Diamondbacks got on the board in the series in a 2–1 victory in Game 3, thanks to a walk-off single by Ketel Marte. Alek Thomas and Gabriel Moreno would help the Diamondbacks come from behind in the bottom of the eighth inning to even the series at two. However, the Phillies regained the series lead in Game 5 with a 6–1 victory as Zach Wheeler pitched seven solid innings, giving up only one earned run. Back in Philadelphia for Game 6, the Diamondbacks, thanks to consecutive home runs from Tommy Pham and Lourdes Gurriel Jr., as well as an RBI double from Evan Longoria, jumped out to a big lead early and didn't relinquish it, winning 5–1 to force a seventh game. In Game 7, the Phillies took an early lead thanks to an RBI double from Bryson Stott. Then, Corbin Carroll hit an RBI single to tie the game at two. It was followed by another RBI single from Moreno, which gave the Diamondbacks a lead they would not relinquish, as they won 4–2 to clinch the pennant.\n2023 World Series.\n(AL5) Texas Rangers vs. (NL6) Arizona Diamondbacks.\nThis was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThis was the first World Series to be played entirely in the American Southwest, and the third World Series to feature two expansion teams (2015, 2019). It is also significant as this World Series features both the oldest and youngest expansion teams in the league – the Rangers were added to the league in 1961 (as the Washington Senators), while the Diamondbacks joined the league in 1998.\nThis was the third World Series appearance for the Rangers. They last made it in 2011, where they fell to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games after being one strike away from winning the championship twice. This was the second appearance for the Diamondbacks, who won in their previous appearance in 2001 against the New York Yankees in seven games. The Rangers defeated the Diamondbacks in five games to win their first championship in franchise history, ending the longest championship drought among expansion teams in North American sports.\nIn Game 1, the Diamondbacks led 5–3 going into the bottom of the ninth, until Corey Seager hit a two-run home run to tie the game and send it to extra innings. Adolis García hit a walk-off solo home run in the bottom of the eleventh to win the game for the Rangers. Merrill Kelly pitched seven solid innings for the Diamondbacks in Game 2 as they blew out the Rangers to even the series headed to Phoenix. Marcus Semien’s RBI single and another two-run home run from Seager carried the Rangers to victory in Game 3 to regain the series lead. Game 4 was once again controlled by the Rangers, as they put up 10 runs across the second and third innings, with Seager, Semien, and Jonah Heim all hitting home runs. Despite the Diamondbacks cutting their lead to four in the bottom of the ninth, the Rangers won 11–7 to take a 3–1 series lead. Game 5 started out as a pitcher’s duel between Arizona’s Zac Gallen and Texas’ Nathan Eovaldi. Gallen pitched a no-hitter through six innings, until it was broken up by a base hit from Seager. Mitch Garver drove in Seager with an RBI single to put the Rangers in the lead for good, which was then capped off by a series-sealing two-run home run in the ninth by Semien off closer Paul Sewald.\nThe Rangers became the second fifth-seeded team to win the World Series, joining the 2014 San Francisco Giants. It is also the second consecutive World Series won by a team from Texas, after the Houston Astros did so the previous year. This was the first championship of the four major North American sports leagues won by a team from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex since 2011, when the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks won their first NBA championship. Bruce Bochy became the first manager to win a World Series with a team he had previously defeated to win a World Series.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision coverage.\nCoverage of the four Wild Card Series was produced by ESPN. ABC aired the Texas–Tampa Bay series, ESPN televised both the Toronto–Minnesota and Miami–Philadelphia series, and ESPN2 had the Arizona–Milwaukee series.\nBoth the National League Division Series and the National League Championship Series were on TBS.

The tournament will involve 32 national teams, including that of the host nation to be decided in 2025.\nHost selection.\nThe host nation for the 2031 Women's World Cup is scheduled to be decided by the FIFA Congress in the second quarter of 2025, a year after the host selection for the 2027 edition, with bid regulations for approval in the second quarter of 2024.\nAFC.\nIn October 2022, the General Administration of Sport of China and the Chinese Football Association announced a new women's football program that would include a bid to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. In 2024, the two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau have also expressed interest in joining the Chinese bid even though they currently have separate FAs (HKFA and AFM). The country previously hosted the inaugural tournament in 1991 and they won the rights to host the 2003 edition, but it was instead hosted by the United States due to the SARS epidemic. The 2007 edition was automatically awarded to China by FIFA as compensation. Other FIFA and AFC tournaments that China has hosted include the 1985 U-17 World Cup, 1997 AFC Women's Championship, 2004 AFC Asian Cup, 2004 AFC U-19 Women's Championship, 2007 AFC U-19 Women's Championship, 2009 AFC U-19 Women's Championship, 2010 AFC U-19 Championship, 2011 AFC U-16 Women's Championship, 2015 AFC U-16 Women's Championship, 2015 AFC U-19 Women's Championship, 2017 AFC U-19 Women's Championship, and 2018 AFC U-23 Championship.\nCAF.\nIn October 2023, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation president Fouzi Lekjaa declared an interest to bid for hosting the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup, following Morocco's selection of hosting 2030 FIFA World Cup and the debut performance of women's team on the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. This would be Morocco's first time ever of hosting FIFA female tournament. Morocco previously hosted the 1988 African Cup of Nations and they won the rights to host the 2015 edition, but it was rewarded to Equatorial Guinea due to Ebola epidemic. Morocco also hosted the 2018 African Nations Championship, the 2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations, the 2023 U-23 Africa Cup of Nations and many tournaments under the UNAF banner and is about to host the 2024 Women's Africa Cup of Nations and the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations. The only FIFA tournament that Morocco hosted was the 2013, the 2014 and the 2022 editions of FIFA Club World Cup.\nOn 24 November 2023, the South Africa Football Association announced the withdrawal of its bid for the 2027 edition in favor of a 2031 bid. South Africa has previously hosted the 1996 AFCON, 2000 WAFCON, 2004 WAFCON, 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2010 WAFCON, 2010 FIFA World Cup, 2011 U-20 AFCON, 2013 AFCON, and the 2014 CHAN.\nCONCACAF.\nOn April 29, 2024, the United States Soccer Federation and Mexican Football Federation jointly announced that they would withdraw their bid for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup and instead bid for the 2031 edition. The United States previously hosted the 1999 edition and 2003 edition, while Mexico has never hosted a Women's World Cup. Both countries are co-hosts of the 2026 men's World Cup alongside Canada; media outlets speculated that the close proximity of the two events along with the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles may have been a factor in the changed bid plan.\nUEFA.\nIn May 2023, The Football Association announced their intention to bid following the success of their women's team at the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 and the large attendance at Wembley Stadium for the 2022 Women's FA Cup final. This would be England's first time hosting the women's tournament, though they have significant hosting experience including the 1963 UEFA U-18, 1966 FIFA World Cup, 1983 UEFA U-18, 1993 UEFA U-18, UEFA Euro 1996, 2001 UEFA U-16, 2018 UEFA U-17, and several matches of UEFA Euro 2020. A bid alongside Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Northern Ireland similar to their successful UEFA Euro 2028 bid has also been noted.\nIn May 2023, former Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau proposed a bid for Barcelona to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. Following the victory in the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labor Yolanda Díaz proposed a World Cup bid to Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. Spain's previous FIFA Tournament hosting experience includes the 1982 FIFA World Cup, the 1964 Euro, the 1957, the 1972, 1994 UEFA U-18 Cups, the 1996 UEFA U-21 Cup, the 1988 UEFA U-16 Cup and the upcoming 2030 FIFA World Cup."

The IGF posts weekly lists of qualified male and female golf players based on their current standings.\nPoints are awarded to the players based on their final positions in each event, with performances in the events with stronger fields earning more points, based on a points distribution schedule approved by the IGF. Ranking points for each player accumulate over a two-year “rolling” period with the points awarded in the most recent thirteen-week period weighted at a full percentage of their original value. After the initial 13-week period, the points are devalued by 1.1% for each of the next 91 weeks before they drop entirely off the player's two-year record. The IGF Olympic ranking is ordered according to the average points that the players manage to accumulate over the applicable two-year period. Calculating the average points is to divide the total number of ranking points accumulated by the player in the number of tournaments in which he or she has competed during the two-year period.\nQualification summary.\nThe following table outlines the NOCs qualified for the Olympic golf tournament with the number of golfers entered per NOC."

        "title": "1857 baseball convention",
        "text": "The 1857 baseball convention was a meeting of members from 16 New York City-area baseball clubs that took place over multiple sessions in early 1857. It passed numerous clarifications of the pre-existing Knickerbocker Rules and modifications that helped lead to the modern format of baseball games. Among the items formalized were the length of games and the distance between bases.\nAt the convention, multiple members of the New York Knickerbockers club presented the \"Laws of Base Ball\", a series of documents that contained proposed rules, some of which were edited in response to feedback. The law documents drafted for the convention survived and were sold at auction for more than $3 million in 2015.\nBackground.\nAfter the pioneering New York Knickerbockers club was founded in 1845, baseball grew slowly at first in the New York City area. However, by 1855 it had started to accelerate in popularity, as two dozen teams were in existence that year. The nature of games played between the teams changed during the period. While early Knickerbockers games functioned mainly as social events that allowed players to exercise and fraternize with other players, by 1855, competitive match games had grown more frequent. As a result, the existing rules proved inadequate in addressing various situations that arose in competitive play.\nWhile opposing teams agreed upon their own match rules, which led to changes in common practices, a uniform code of regulations was lacking. Even items such as the types of balls and bats to be used were not standardized. The rules also had aspects that could be taken advantage of in unintended ways that went against the spirit of the game. Meanwhile, new clubs often wrote into sports columns in newspapers asking for clarifications on rules. Another factor driving the push was the general improvement of fielding skills, which at the time was the most crucial aspect of the game. \nThe original Knickerbocker Rules, which the Knickerbockers used for internal play, dated back to 1845, with small adjustments made three years later. Following an 1854 meeting involving three teams—the Eagles, Gothams, and Knickerbockers—a set of match play guidelines were coded to address rules differences between the clubs. One year later, with the increase in match play accelerating, the idea of a convention addressing the rules was floated, but the Knickerbockers were not involved in the efforts, which proved futile. By 1856, the Knickerbockers were ready to participate, and in December of that year a call for a convention was made. Historian William Ryczek wrote that \"the Knicks, Eagles and Gothams realized they could no longer decide the fate of the game among themselves.\" \nConvention and creation of Laws documents.\nThe Knickerbockers took the lead in organizing the convention, as the team held an internal meeting on December 6, 1856. It formed a three-man committee led by Doc Adams to accomplish the task of gaining attendance from New York City-area clubs. Sixteen clubs agreed to participate in the convention, which was held over at least two sessions. The first took place on January 22, 1857, while the second was held about a month later, on February 25. Press advertisements indicated that a session would be held on February 3, but no records of any committee activities having taken place on that date are known to exist. Of the 16 clubs, 14 sent representatives to the first meeting. The other two teams sent members to the second session, but not all representatives from the first session returned. As a result, neither session had attendance from every team.\nAt the January 22 meeting of the convention, which was held in a Broome Street hotel, each of the 14 attending clubs sent three delegates. The teams started by naming officers; Adams was selected as president. A handful of other officers from varying teams were named. The convention saw the Knickerbockers present a series of documents collectively titled the \"Laws of Base Ball\", which had been drafted in 1856. Adams probably wrote one of the documents himself, according to historian John Thorn, while fellow Knickerbocker William Grenelle contributed a second Laws paper and a document titled \"Rules for Match Games of Base Ball\", which contained playing ground guidelines not addressed elsewhere. The papers were then edited and put together prior to the convention. Some of the papers Grenelle contributed have visible penciled changes, from a different writer; Thorn believes that Adams made the edits. The Knickerbockers did not initially gain approval for the drafts; instead, a rules committee was appointed to meet on January 28; the attending clubs each sent one delegate. Other items discussed at the first meeting included the possibility of a baseball field being built in Central Park, which led to the appointment of a five-member lobbying committee, and the delegates voted to charge clubs a $2 assessment.\nWhen the rules committee met on January 28, William H. Van Cott, a member of the Gothams, was named chairman. The Knickerbockers' proposal was discussed, and a final draft was made to present during the second full meeting of the committee. Some of the items were amended after floor motions, but the resulting version was ultimately approved.\nRules and regulations.\nGame length.\nOne of the major items addressed in the Laws was the prescribed length of games. Under the Knickerbocker Rules, games did not have a set number of innings, instead concluding when a team reached 21 runs. This method left potential issues regarding match play, as was evidenced by an 1856 game between the Knickerbockers and the Empire club; each team scored 21 runs over eight innings and the game ended in a tie. This was not the only factor that threatened to prevent matches from having winners. As match play became more widespread in the mid-1850s, teams improved and contests became closer and lower-scoring in nature. Under practices of the time, in the event that neither team scored 21 runs before darkness or inclement weather forced a stoppage of play, a game ended in a draw. Teams seeking to play for a stalemate could easily do so by not swinging at pitches, as no system of calling balls and strikes existed. One list of 55 games played in 1856 showed 11 draws, which led \"Porter\"s magazine to write that the situation had led to \"the disgust of parties who have gone into the field for an afternoon's recreation.\"\nThe \"Match Games\" document originally indicated that games should last 12 innings, but the number was changed to nine during editing. The issue resulted in a divide between the Knickerbockers and club delegates Adams and Louis Wadsworth; the team had supported seven-inning games, but Adams and Wadsworth sought longer contests. Although \"Porter\"s stated that the shorter game length had won support at the convention, nine-inning games were decided upon, following a motion by Wadsworth. Also in the rules was a provision that, should a game be suspended due to weather, the leading team would be declared the winner if five innings had been played; these new rules served to remove the possibility of draws.\nField dimensions.\nThe convention also brought clarity to the topic of the distance between bases. Previously, the distance had been listed as 42 paces between first base and third base, and from second base to home plate. The actual distance depended upon the definition of \"pace\"; a two-and-a-half foot pace would have resulted in a distance of around 75 feet, while a person actually pacing out the steps could lead to inconsistencies. Adams later wrote that the pre-existing standard \"was rather vague\". In the Rules document, he and Grenelle changed the definition of a baseball field to focus on the overall basepath. The first page of Rules prescribed a 42-yard distance between first and third bases, and second base and home plate, which would have resulted in bases being 89.1 feet apart. Before the convention, a change was made that Thorn called \"a small step, but one of simple genius\". The distance between bases was set at 90 feet, leaving 127 feet between second base and home plate. \nIn the Laws document, Adams also took a step to provide more precise specifications for how far the pitcher would stand from home plate. While the laws originally called for a distance of 15 to 16 yards, depending on where the pitcher decided to stand, he changed the document to set the distance at 45 feet. Dating back to 1854, the previous regulations had merely called for the pitcher to be \"not less than fifteen paces\" from home plate, leaving open the possibility of pitchers positioning themselves off-center when throwing. To restrict the possible location, section 5 of the rules specified that the position be inside \"a line four yard in length, drawn at right angles to a line from home to the second base, having a center upon that line\". As had been the case in 1845 rules, the document provided that balks could be called against pitchers, subject to the judgement of umpires, which would result in all baserunners moving up one base. One field regulation likely added due to input from the convention floor was a regulation restricting where batters could stand. It prevented batters from standing behind home plate; had the committee's draft not been tweaked, weakly hit balls would have had a greater chance of being foul balls.\nEquipment.\nEarly baseball bats could be either round or flat. Section 2 of the Laws document mandated the use of round bats, which were to be made of wood and limited to a maximum diameter of two inches. The Knickerbockers' original draft had permitted one side of the bat to be shaved flat in a manner similar to a cricket bat, which according to the document was meant to allow for improved aiming on batted balls. For unknown reasons, this part of the draft failed to make it through the rules committee.\nThe rules also addressed the size of the baseball, calling for balls to be between 6 and 6.5 ounces in weight, and between 10 and 10.25 inches in circumference. Both sets of numbers were increased from the 1854 rules, although balls meeting the older guidelines ended up closer to modern equivalents.\nGambling ban and player regulations.\nA surge in interest from gamblers, as well as the existence of loopholes for clubs to take advantage of existing player eligibility regulations, led to responses in the 1857 rules. A new addition in the Laws documents, in section 30, was a ban on gambling by players or umpires. This served to discourage gambling by involved parties, although fan wagers were not mentioned in the guideline. However, section 33 banned bystanders from talking with players or umpires during play, unless by request of an umpire.\nIn addition, the rules stated that players were required to be members of their clubs for 30 days before appearing in a game, and that they could play for only one team. These changes were made to avert a repeat of an 1856 game between the Gothams and Knickerbockers in which the Gothams had fielded a player who was a member of the Union Club at the same time, leading to protests by the Knickerbockers and criticism from the Union Club. The customs of the day favored teams fielding nine-player squads in match games, although it was not specifically prescribed in existing rules and some games played outside the New York City area saw varying numbers of players. Section 27 of the Laws codified the nine-player guideline, going against the wishes of the Knickerbockers, who had wanted the minimum player number set at seven.\nFailed proposals.\nAlong with player and inning numbers, another item supported by the Knickerbockers that failed to make it past the rules committee was the \"fly game\", in which fielders who caught a batted ball on the fly would record an out, but not those who made a catch after the first bounce. Under regulations of the time, an out was posted when a batted ball was caught after one bounce; this was known as the bound rule. Adams himself was a strong proponent of the proposal. The Knickerbockers proposed a compromise in which the fly game would apply to fair balls, but foul balls could be caught on a hop. The committee rejected the proposal, leaving the bound game intact. Newer clubs opposed the change due to a fear that fielders would wind up with hand injuries. They were joined by some established teams, as neither the Eagles nor Gotham backed the change. As part of the rules passed, baserunners were prohibited from advancing on balls caught on the fly; modern guidelines that allowed runners to tag up were not introduced until 1859. \"Porter\"s had endorsed adding a regulation that would allow umpires to call strikes on batters \"who did not swing at good pitches\", but this also failed to gain a consensus.\nAftermath.\nThe \"Laws of Base Ball\" have been described by historian William Hershberger as \"the direct ancestor of modern baseball.\" Items such as the nine-inning standard game length, 90-foot distance between bases, and number of players addressed in the laws carried forward and remain in use in baseball, forming the structure of the modern sport. The distance from the pitcher to home plate was extended two times after 1857; the second adjustment came in 1893. \nIn March 1858, yet another meeting of clubs was held. There, as Adams wrote, \"the annual convention was declared a permanent organization, and with the requisite constitution and by-laws\", the National Association of Base Ball Players was formed. That year, another significant change was made to the rules, as called strikes were added. The adjustment, along with the addition of called balls in 1863, made the pitcher a more significant factor than in previous years. The fly game was debated for another seven years after 1857 before a one-year trial was adopted in 1864 for balls hit in fair territory. The rule, which was expanded to cover foul balls in 1883, remains in use in modern baseball.\nDocument sales.\nTwenty-three pages from the \"Laws\" draft documents survived, having been kept by Grenelle's family. In 1999, they were sold as part of a lot of vintage documents for $12,650. At the time, the authorship was not known. In 2015, the buyer came forward to SCP Auctions, and analysis revealed the documents' authorship and significance. At an online auction the following year, the documents sold for over $3.2 million, the most that baseball-related papers had ever gone for at the time and more than three times what the auction house had estimated. In 2018, the Laws appeared in a Library of Congress exhibition, having been loaned by the buyer."

Veith also missed the end of the season to recover further from her injuries. In addition, after a great start to the season, defending overall champion Lara Gut suffered a season-ending injury during the 2017 World Championships in early February, costing her a chance to repeat.\nAs noted, the season was interrupted by the 2017 World Ski Championships, which were held from 6–20 February in St. Moritz, Switzerland. \nAt the end of the season, Mikaela Shiffrin, who also won the slalom discipline for the fourth time and was second in the giant slalom discipline, became the third American woman and fifth American overall to win the overall World Cup championship for a season, joining former men's champions Phil Mahre (1981-82-83) and Bode Miller (2005, '08) and women's champions Tamara McKinney (1983) and Vonn. \nThe season finals were held in Aspen, Colorado for the first time -- and the first time in the United States since Vail, Colorado was the host in 1997, twenty years prior."

After an injury-plagued season he was released and later signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before being released again before the 2006 season.\nCollege football.\nJohnson was recruited out of South Grand Prairie High School, where he was regarded as the top college prospect in the state and the top WR prospect in the country. he helped his team make it to the state semi-finals in his senior year. Johnson caught 71 passes that season for 1,749 yards and 20 touchdowns. In three seasons and 42 games as a starter, Johnson had 135 catches for 3,059 yards and 42 touchdowns. Johnson was heavily recruited and chose to attend Texas.\nHe was a Texas player from 2000 to 2003. He scored 16 touchdowns on 152 receptions for 2,389 yards.\nIn 2000, Johnson was the first freshman to start at wide receiver since 1992 and then had one of the best freshman receiver seasons in school history setting seven records. He set the school's freshman single-season record with 41 receptions and also set the school's single-game freshman for receptions (9) and receiving yards (187) in 2000. He and Roy Williams set the school's receiving record for two freshmen with 81 receptions for 1,507 yards and 11 touchdowns.\nHe caught the game-winning catch against Texas Tech in 2003.\nWhen his college career was over, he had the 2nd most receiving TDs, 3rd most receiving yards and fourth most receptions in Texas football history. He was an All-Big 12 honorable mention in his last three seasons. He was the favorite target of Major Applewhite and 2nd favorite of Chris Simms\nJohnson broke his tibia before his senior year, a fact he was unaware of until after the season was over. Then, during preparation for the Senior Bowl, he strained his oblique. His injuries meant he had to miss combines and other pre-draft exhibitions and contributed to him going undrafted.\nPro football.\nJohnson was signed by the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in part because the Broncos coach, Mike Shanahan, knew him as he'd played with Shanahan's son Kyle. He was signed to a three-year contract.\nIn August 2004, he was placed on the injured reserve list for the season after breaking his ankle. Later that season, he tore his hamstring. Before he 2005 season started, he was waived by the Broncos.\nIn January 2006 he was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers where he was reunited with Simms. He injured his shoulder and was then released in May to make room on the Bucs roster for David Boston.\nLater life.\nAfter his football career was over, Johnson became an entrepreneur, starting a Vodka company and becoming the principal in a concrete company."

        "text": "The women's super-G in the 2017 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved seven events, including the season final in Aspen, Colorado (USA). Defending discipline (and overall) champion Lara Gut from Switzerland got off to a great start by winning the first three races, but she suffered a season-ending injury in early February, which led to a tight battle between the two top contenders remaining: Slovenia's Ilka Štuhec and Liechtenstein's Tina Weirather. With just the season finals in Aspen remaining, Štuhec, who had won two races in the discipline and won the season title in the downhill the day before the race, held a 15-point lead over Weirather, but Weirather nipped Štuhec by 0.35 seconds in the finals, giving her the season title by 5 points.\nWeirather thus became a second-generation World Cup discipline champion, as her father Harti Weirather was World Cup downhill discipline champion in 1981 and her mother Hanni Wenzel won the overall World Cup championship twice (1978, '80). Weirather and her mother also became the first mother-daughter pair to win season trophies in the 51 years of FIS Alpine skiing World Cup competition.\nThe season was interrupted by the 2017 World Ski Championships, which were held from 6–20 February in St. Moritz, Switzerland. The women's super-G was held on 7 February."

He appeared in every game throughout his two years in San Diego, starting 13 out of 28 games and being credited with three sacks. In 1968, the newly-formed Cincinnati Bengals selected Griffin after the Chargers made him available in the expansion draft. Griffin appeared in every game for the Bengals and started all but one.

        "text": "The 2018–19 Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey season was the 75th season of play for the program and the 7th in the NCHC conference. The Bulldogs represented the University of Minnesota Duluth and were coached by Scott Sandelin, in his 19th season.\nSeason.\nComing off of the program's second national championship, Duluth was ranked #1 in the preseason polls. With most of their principle scorers and virtually the entire defensive corps returning, the team was in a tremendous position to repeat. Leading the way, however, was the Bulldogs' star goaltender Hunter Shepard, who would live up to his billing as one of if not the best goaltender in the nation.\nDuluth stumbled out of the gate, losing a weekend to old rival Minnesota, but then reeled off eight consecutive victories, including a sweep of then #1 Notre Dame, to reclaim their top position. The Bulldogs went through a bit of a rough patch in the middle of the season, going more than two months (including the winter break) without sweeping a weekend. The up and down play dropped them to #5 in the polls but the Bulldogs were never really in jeopardy of missing out on the NCAA tournament. UMD ended the regular season with a showdown between two of the top teams in the nation when they met St. Cloud State. While they dropped both games, Duluth lost by just a single goal on each occasion and pushed one of the contests into overtime.\nThe Bulldogs opened their postseason with a relatively easy opponent in Omaha but still struggled in the two games. Duluth had been a defensive powerhouse all season long but their offense was rather pedestrian. With UMD going 1-for-10 on the power play and needing overtime to finish off a team that was 13 games under .500, there was little doubt that it would be up to Shepard and the defense to carry them through the rest of the playoffs.\nLuckily, the Bulldogs were already battle-tested and stood strong in the Frozen Faceoff. Shepard posted his 6th shutout of the season against Denver to set up a showdown for conference bragging right with St. Cloud State. After exchanging goals in the first, the match turned into a defensive struggle but the Huskies pulled ahead at the beginning of the third period. After failing to capitalize on their third man-advantage of the game, Duluth was forced to kill off a tripping penalty with just over 6 minutes remaining. The Bulldogs could not afford to fall down by two with their offensive struggles and rallied to keep the puck out of the net. In a dramatic turn of events, St. Cloud coughed up the puck in their own during the power play and could only watch as Tanner Laderoute found a wide-open Billy Exell in the slot who tied the game on only his second goal of the season. The goaltending duel resumed afterwards and remained in place for the rest of the game. Near the mid-way point of the second overtime, Nick Swaney ended the game in dramatic fashion and gave Duluth the conference championship.\nWhile St. Cloud State remained as the #1 team in spite of the loss, Duluth was able to rise up to #2 after winning the NCHC title. The Bulldogs travelled to Allentown for the midwest regional and faced #15 Bowling Green in their opening game, a rematch of the 1984 championship game. Despite being heavily favored in the match, Duluth's offense was lacking and UMD entered the third period down 0–1. After coming up empty on their fourth power play opportunity of the game and will less than 5 minutes remaining in the contest it appeared that UMD's luck was about to run out. Fortunately for the Bulldogs, Parker Mackay had other ideas. Mackay finally beat Ryan Bednard for Duluth's first goal of the game with just 3:01 left in regulation. Mackay then ended the game in overtime with his 14th of the season and allow Minnesota Duluth to survive and advance.\nDuluth appeared to relax after the first victory in the tournament and strangled the offenses of their succeeding opponents. In the next game, Quinnipiac managed their only goal of the game after pulling their goaltender while on the power play. However, an empty-net goal from Parker Mackay shortly afterwards ended the Bobcats' comeback attempt. The national semifinal too saw UMD surrendering one power play marker but Billy Excell's third goal of the season proved to be the game-winner over Providence.\nThe championship game pitted Duluth against Massachusetts, who possessed the #2 offense in the nation as well as the Hobey Baker Award winner, Cale Makar. Duluth was undaunted and constrained the Minutemen for the entire match. The Bulldog defense snuffed out every attempt on goal and limited UMass to just 18 shots for the game. In the meantime, Parker Mackay opened the scoring on the man-advantage, scoring the first power play goal for Duluth in 7 games. After ending the 0-for-16 streak just 4 minutes into the match, Duluth played like they knew they were going to win the game. The Bulldogs scored once in each period but completely dominated the contest. There was very little drama in the game but that didn't dampen the team's celebration in the slightest and UMD became the first team in 14 years to repeat as national champions.\nSchedule and Results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The Nigeria national rugby sevens team is a sporting side that represents Nigeria internationally in rugby sevens.\nHistory.\nNigeria participated in the C.A.R (Confederation of African Rugby) in Marrakesh, Morocco on 24–25 September 2011. In the pool stages they defeated Senegal and Burkina Faso but were beaten by hosts Morocco, however they still progressed to the semi-finals where they were to face regular IRB participants, Tunisia.\nNigeria were beaten in the semi-finals by a very experienced Tunisian team, however pride was restored in the 3rd/ 4th place playoff against Ivory Coast, where they came from behind in the second half to force the game into sudden death extra time where a last minute try by Craig Olugbode gave the victory to the Nigerian team. This meant Nigeria qualified for the All Africa 7s tournament in September 2012 which was the African regional ranking and qualifying tournament for the Rugby World Cup 7s in Russia in 2013.\nIn the African regional RWC 7s qualifier held again in Morocco on 29 and 30 September 2012 the Nigeria 7s team finished third overall and just missed out on RWC qualification. Failure to beat Madagascar in the group game despite dominating the match meant that Nigeria would play tournament favourites Zimbabwe in the semi-final rather than Tunisia. Nigeria lost 19-14 and Zimbabwe went on to beat Tunisia 31-7 in the final. Nigeria had the chance to redeem themselves however and beat Madagascar 20-12 in the 3rd/4th place playoff leaving them 5th ranked in Africa and the 3rd ranked African Commonwealth member.\nNigeria 7s qualified to participate at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in Scotland. They were drawn alongside Canada, hosts Scotland and all-time Commonwealth champions New Zealand but the team was shockingly withdrawn by the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) without clarifications as to why such a decision was made. A decision which according to IRB’s Mark Egan \"Is disappointing for the Nigerian rugby team and their Rugby Union. There is a chance to get going with their Rugby 7s surge as the team will be competing at the Africa Men 7s in September 2014 in Kenya with the likes of South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Madagascar, Tunisia, Morocco, Ivory Coast and Zambia.\"\nThe team finished in eight place at The Rugby Africa Men’s Sevens Olympic Qualifiers at the Barnard Stadium in Kempton Park, Johannesburg on Saturday 14th and Sunday 15 November 2015. injuries and knocks to five members of the team affected their overall performance as captain; Azeez Ladipo injured his shoulder in the early minutes of the first game and they managed him through some matches. Nuhu Samaila, Ike Onwukanjo, Onyinye Onwukanjo, Hafis Ayinla; were also injured leaving the team with one substitute in the last two matches. Coach Fabian Juries explained that the team improved from their 2014 outing where they placed eleventh and says there is room for more improvement. “We set a quarter final target and the boys met it but going forward, we need to work on strength and conditioning of the team and ensure they play together in more tournaments”.\nPlayers.\nNigeria 7-A-Side Squad For Africa Cup 7s 2014.\nCoach: Fabian Juries.

        "text": "George Washington is an outdoor equestrian statue by the American sculptor Frederick Roth located near the Ford Mansion, Washington's Headquarters, in Morristown, New Jersey, United States. It was commissioned by philanthropist E. Mabel Clark to commemorate General George Washington's importance to the history of the city. The bronze sculpture was dedicated on October 19, 1928, the anniversary of the surrender of British General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.\nHistory.\nMorristown was the site of two winter encampments by the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The first one was from January to May 1777, with Washington's headquarters at Arnold's Tavern. The second one was from December 1779 to June 1780, with Washington's headquarters at the Ford Mansion.\nE. Mabel Clark was the daughter of Charles F. Clark, President of the Bradstreet Company, now Dun &amp; Bradstreet. The family lived in New York City and had a country house, \"Fairacres\", in the Normandy Park section of Morristown. She commissioned Frederick Roth for an equestrian statue of Washington and specified that the horse be modeled after the workhorse she had seen pulling a milk wagon in New York. Roth was known as an animal sculptor, especially for his 1925 Statue of Balto in New York's Central Park. He finished and had the statue cast in Florence, Italy, at the bronze works foundry of Gusmano Vignali . The installation site, a small triangular plot bounded by Morris and Washington Avenues, was donated to the city by Dr. Henry M. Dodge. Clark donated the statue to the city at the dedication on October 19, 1928. Speakers included Mayor Clyde W. Potts and Justice Charles W. Parker of the New Jersey Supreme Court. The sculptor attended the ceremony and was honored at a reception hosted by Clark.\nDescription.\nThe sculpture depicts Washington in winter, wearing a uniform with a mantle and tricorner hat. The sculptor signed it: F.G.R. Roth. The statue measures approximately high x wide x long and is on a granite base that measures approximately high x wide x long. The front of the base is inscribed: Washington, the back is inscribed:\nLegacy.\nA photograph of the statue, with Washington's Headquarters in the background, was featured in the booklet for the dedication of the Morristown National Historical Park on July 4, 1933. Clark was a member of the reception committee. The statue was surveyed by the Save Outdoor Sculpture program of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 1994."

A usual basketball game consists of five-on-five. There is three-on-three, or even six-on-six.\nTracy McGrady's Ones Basketball League is a one-on-one basketball league.\nFeatures of one-on-one basketball which may differ from a normal game include \"make it take it\", where making a shot is rewarded with possession of the ball instead of giving it to the opposing team. Also, when there is a change of possession, the player who just got the ball has to take the ball back behind the free throw line. Often times in one-on-one a player is expected to \"check\" the ball, meaning to start a possession by passing it to the opposing defender, who then passes it back."

        "title": "Putney to Wimbledon line",
        "text": "The Putney and Wimbledon line is a short railway route in south-west London. It was built by the London and South Western Railway as a collaborative arrangement with the Metropolitan District Railway. It was opened in 1889. The LSWR constructed Fulham Railway Bridge, although that was only ever used by District Railway trains. A spur connection from East Putney to the line from Barnes to Waterloo was used by LSWR trains.\nThe line was electrified for the District Railway trains in 1905, and the LSWR adopted the electrical system for its own trains on the line in 1916. The electrification proved very successful for the District Railway, although LSWR results were disappointing. In the first years of the twentieth century rapid residential development was stimulated alongside the line, and in the 1920s and 1930s this accelerated considerably, especially in the vicinity of the stations.\nUse of the line by the LSWR and its successors has declined, and is limited to empty stock trains and occasional special excursions, but the District Line, as successor to the District Railway, continues in busy use.\nHistory.\nRival schemes.\nOn 1 March 1880 the Metropolitan District Railway opened a line from West Brompton to a station in Fulham, named Putney Bridge and Fulham. The District did this through a nominally independent company called the Fulham Extension Railway. The alignment of the terminus made it obvious that the next step was to bridge the Thames and strike south.\nThe District company was contemplating the southward extension when a projected company calling itself the Guildford, Kingston and London Railway promoted the possibility of an independent line from Guildford through Surbiton and Kingston to Fulham. The promoters hoped to obtain running powers from there through the District Railway line to the City of London. This would have been in direct competition with the established routes of the LSWR; in addition the proposal presumed outer suburban main line steam trains mingling with the District Railway’s own traffic through the tunnels from Earl’s Court to Mansion House. Both the LSWR and the District Railway were violently against this, and they joined forces to oppose it.\nThe scheme was considered in Parliament in the 1881 session. As part of the opposition tactics, the LSWR presented an alternative scheme for a new railway from Guildford to Surbiton only, joining its own network at that point. It was the LSWR that emerged successfully, and on 22 August 1881 its proposal was authorised; the LSWR line opened as the New Guildford Line in 1885.\nThe Kingston company was still active and was proposing a shorter line from Surbiton to Putney Bridge, but the District and LSWR managed to kill that off, and secured an Act of 18 August 1882 which dissolved the Kingston scheme. However the Putney to Surbiton route was still authorised, now to be built by the LSWR and the District together. Another Act of the same date authorised the Wimbledon and West Metropolitan Junction Railway; this was promoted by disappointed residents of Wimbledon in reaction to the abandonment of the Kingston line. It was to meet the intended Kingston line route a little to the south of Putney and run to Wimbledon; it too was reluctantly sponsored by the District and LSWR.\nJoint usage proposed.\nWith an unwanted railway authorised, and money in short supply, a resolution emerged, in that the Kingston line was finally abandoned, and the short section at Putney required by the Wimbledon line was incorporated into that line's authorisation, by Act of 25 June 1886. Only the LSWR had the financial resources to build the line, so the whole project was passed into LSWR control. The termination at Wimbledon had been planned to cross the LSWR main line and join the Tooting line, but this was made more rational by arranging to run to terminal platforms on the north side of the LSWR station, with a junction for through trains. Mutual running powers existed, for the District to run to Wimbledon and for the LSWR to run to High Street Kensington or South Kensington. The LSWR would have had to make its own terminus at South Kensington due to the lack of space at the District station there, but in fact it never exercised its running powers and never built the station.\nThe 1886 Act formalised a number of agreements, including the abandonment of the Wimbledon and West Metropolitan Railway scheme. The Act also confirmed final abandonment of the Kingston line, and authorised the diversion at Wimbledon. The LSWR could work the finished lines alone or jointly with the District. The District was to run at least twenty passenger and coaching trains daily to Wimbledon, with the LSWR paying the running expenses and local passengers having indiscriminate use of both companies' trains.\nLSWR shareholders were told on 11 August 1886 that the District \"will not have any line of railway south of the Thames: the bridge will be ours; we shall join them at Fulham, and from that, including the bridge, will be bona fide South Western property\". Works started in 1887; the bridge was the River Thames Fulham railway bridge at Putney; it had five spans of between cylinder centres and with headway at high water. It was begun in April 1887, and completed by April 1889. \nOpening for traffic.\nThe Wimbledon station was described as the \"North Station\"; it had two new platforms with a central engine release road, and a separate booking office adjacent to the LSWR's platform 1. The line between Wimbledon and Fulham opened on 3 June 1889, with intermediate stations at Wimbledon Park, Southfields and East Putney, served only by District trains from Whitechapel. Thirty-one trains worked each way daily to the City, operated by the District's characteristic Beyer-Peacock 440T locomotives and trains of 4-wheeled coaches. LSWR trains started operating on 1 July 1889 between Wimbledon and Waterloo via the Putney Junction line, and therefore did not cross the river bridge. \nPutney Junction lines.\nTo link the Richmond line at Point Pleasant Junction with the Fulham to Wimbledon line at East Putney Junction, the Putney Junction lines opened on 1 July 1889. As authorised on 10 August 1882, both up and down lines were to have diverged from the Richmond line to the north, and then crossed high over that line turning south to join the Wimbledon line. The Richmond line was becoming congested, however, and quadrupling of it necessitated a grade-separated junction from Point Pleasant; the down line diverged on the south side to reach East Putney Junction. The change of plan was made within existing limits of deviation and no specific powers were taken, but Major-General Hutchinson on his inspection for the Board of Trade said that if doubts arose, formal powers should be obtained in a future Act. It seems was never done.\nThe earlier half-hourly service of the District Railway had been enhanced to give a 15 minute frequency, and the addition of the LSWR trains on 1 July 1889 added 12 LSWR trains daily each way between Wimbledon and Waterloo. These trains used the double junction with the main lines at the London end of Wimbledon station, and ran to the main station there.\nRevenue.\nThe District Railway found the new line very lucrative: Wimbledon generated a high proportion of first-class tickets. The District Railway chairman, J S Forbes, was able to say in 1896 that the line had increased the company's receipts by over 44% in six years.\nElectrification.\nDistrict Railway.\nBy 1899 the District Railway was working 47 trains a day each way, while the LSWR supplied 15 trains to and from Waterloo. The District electrified its line at 600VDC third and fourth rail, as far as Putney Bridge on 23 July 1905; those trains worked to and from High Street Kensington. The District Railway wished to extend their operation to Wimbledon, and agreement was reached on 4 December 1903 for the LSWR to electrify its tracks in return for District payments of interest on the capital cost. District Railway electric working through to Wimbledon started on 27 August 1905, giving a significant increase in service frequency, most trains running through to East Ham.\nLSWR.\nThe LSWR decided to instal electric traction in large areas of its suburban district, and the first line treated was from Waterloo to Wimbledon via East Putney. The District Railway used 600VDC, so for compatibility the LSWR adopted that voltage. The District trains used a third and fourth rail, whereas the LSWR trains used a third rail only. To enable interoperability the fourth rail was electrically bonded to the running rails. A special isolating section was installed on the river crossing to prevent bridging of the section gap by the bus-lines of passing trains. The LSWR electric operation started on 25 October 1915 on weekdays only; there was a twenty-minute frequency, but patronage was very poor, and the service was soon considerably reduced.\nGrowth of traffic.\nThere were 103 trains each way daily on the line in 1904, the last full year of steam operation on the District line to Wimbledon; about half were District workings. By 1911 the total had grown to 157, of which 93 were District. The route was operated by mechanical signalling, and it was at capacity. New intermediate signal boxes were opened at Cromer Road (Southfields) and Revelstoke Road (Wimbledon Park) to shorten the sections. The LSWR was in the habit of delaying District Railway trains during very busy times such as race days while the crowds cleared the stations. In 1911 there were 19 race days, and 85 District trains had to be cancelled. Meanwhile the District was carrying traffic which had increased by 76% since 1907.\nThe LSWR as owner of the route was under pressure to quadruple the line, and in fact this was authorised by the Metropolitan District Railway Act of 1912. The LSWR would carry out the work, providing a western pair of tracks for the District's exclusive use; Wimbledon station would also be enlarged. However no work on the widening had been done before the conditions of World War I made a start impossible, although an extra terminal platform was provided at the Wimbledon North station by the LSWR. From 9 March 1914 the District operated a ten-minute all-day service to Wimbledon, increased to six minutes at rush hours.\nIn the period from 1910 very heavy growth of suburban housing took place alongside the line, especially around the stations which acted as local centres. The incorporation of the line into the early LSWR electrification scheme encouraged interest in settling in the locality. This was the first part of the LSWR electrification to open, providing a 20-minute frequency on weekdays only from 25 October 1915 between Wimbledon and Waterloo via Wandsworth Town. Although frequency and journey time were excellent, patronage was poor, and in July 1919 when stock was required to augment busier electric services, all trains were withdrawn except for about half a dozen rush-hour workings, that missed calls between Wimbledon Park and East Putney inclusive, reaching Waterloo in 19 minutes. \nWhen regular electric working was resumed on 16 November 1919, trains ran only hourly (half-hourly at peak periods), and even with the low frequency, three-car sets were sufficient for the loading. The line occupation by these and the various freight and empty stock workings caused no great distress to the District, and the urgency was removed from the quadrupling plan. The powers were allowed to lapse, but when rebuilding Wimbledon station in 1929, the Southern Railway (as successor from 1923 to the LSWR) did provide a new four-bay station for the District with its own concourse below the main booking hall.\nAfter 1945 the Southern Region of British Railways, itself a successor to the Southern Railway, no longer made calls at Wimbledon Park, Southfields and East Putney. Steam-hauled freight and empty stock remained commonplace until the early 1960s. Through the 1950s and early 1960s, some fast electric services came this way, usually from the Alton line, and running non-stop between Surbiton and Waterloo. Summer Channel Islands boat trains also worked via East Putney every year from 1953 to 1962 and it was one of these, in the latter year, which formed the last ordinary steam passenger working on the line.\nSignalling characteristics.\nFor many years London Transport drivers working south of West Brompton faced violent contrasts in signalling. Manually worked semaphore signals on the District's own line had been converted to electro-pneumatic automatic working with track circuits and train stops at the time of electrification, and were subsequently replaced by colour light signals on the same system. From East Putney to Wimbledon the line retained its Victorian manual signalling with Sykes lock-and-block working. In foggy weather Underground drivers had the unusual experience of guidance from manually-placed detonators on the rails. It was not until 1970 that the line was fully equipped with colour light signals.\nUp Point Pleasant Spur closed.\nThe connection between East Putney and Point Pleasant Junction was built as a grade-separated junction. Bridges on the up line became structurally defective and it was closed on 4 April 1987, leaving the down line only. Infrastructure alterations were made to enable the remaining down line spur to be used bi-directionally, and this was brought into reversible use on 11 February 1991.\nPresent day.\nThere was an anomaly that the line and stations were controlled by the main line operator and infrastructure owner, while all the local passenger trains on the line were operated by the District Line. Station operation was transferred to London Transport, later Transport for London, from 1 April 1994. Currently (2023) there is a limited traffic of empty stock trains between Wimbledon Carriage Sidings and Waterloo. The dominant traffic on the line is the District Line service of Transport for London."

The High School has never produced a rugby player with a greater natural genius for the game. In every department he excels. His defence is impeccable, in kicking he combines length with accuracy, and no centre knows better than he just how and when to pass so as to give the wing the best possible chance.\nProvincial career.\nHe played for Glasgow District in the 1920 match, when he captained the side, and the 1921 inter-city match.\nInternational career.\nHe received one cap for Scotland, in 1922.\nAlthough usually played at Centre, Johnston earned his Scotland cap at Full Back. It was said that his gave 'his usual sound performance', though Johnston later regretted that he was not 'playing in his proper place'.\nMilitary career.\nHe joined the 6th Highland Light Infantry and saw service in Egypt and Sinai. He was then commissioned in the 9th H.L.I. and spent another two years at Ypres and the Somme. He was mentioned in despatches 3 times.\nFamily.\nHis father, Robert Johnston (1856-1934), was a missionary in Jamaica for over 55 years. He was responsible for the training of ministers, at the Tutorial College for Black Ministers.

At the first meeting in June 2021, the organizing committee considered whether it should change the bid for 2030 or 2034. The decision for Salt Lake City on the bidding for 2030 or 2034 Winter Olympics could be made after Beijing 2022 ending. President and chief executive of the Salt Lake City Bid Committee Fraser Bullock mentioned that the small window between the Los Angeles 2028 and a potential Salt Lake City 2030 Games could be a real difficulty to manage and that the feasibility study for this is still ongoing. The IOC sent a delegation to Salt Lake City, from April 27 to 29, 2022, to conduct an inspection and a technical site visit of the competitions, ceremonies and Olympic Village venues.\nSalt Lake City-Utah Committee for the Games chief executive Fraser Bullock confirmed at a meeting on 1 November 2022 that \"SLC considers the upcoming process is focused on 2030 and SLC will fully participate in that process to hopefully get either the 2030 or 2034 Olympics\".\nIn September 2023, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee officially endorsed Salt Lake City as the American bid city for the Winter Olympics in 2030 or 2034."

        "text": "The women's giant slalom in the 2019 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup involved 8 events. \nThe battle for the discipline championship was waged between two skiers better known for their slalom prowess: Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States and Petra Vlhová of Slovakia. With only the World Cup finals in Soldeu on 17 March remaining, both women had posted three victories in the discipline to distance themselves from the two most recent champions in the discipline, Tessa Worley of France and Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany. But Shiffrin's two other podium finishes, which Vlhová couldn't match, had staked Shiffrin to a 97-point lead over Vlhová, which meant that all Shiffrin needed to do in the finals was finish in the top 15 (since only the top 15 score points in the finals). Instead, Shiffrin actually won the finals to decisively eliminate Vlhová, who finished third in the race. \nThe season was interrupted by the 2019 World Ski Championships, which were held from 4–17 February in Åre, Sweden. The women's giant slalom was held on 14 February."

Shiffrin scored 1,160 points in the discipline for the season out of a possible 1,200.

        "text": "The 2034 Winter Olympics, officially known as XXVII Olympic Winter Games, is an upcoming international multi-sport event scheduled to take place from 10 to 26 February 2034.\nBidding process.\nThe new IOC bidding process was approved at the 134th IOC Session on 24 June 2019 in Lausanne, Switzerland. The key proposals, driven by the relevant recommendations from Olympic Agenda 2020, are:\nThe IOC also modified the Olympic Charter to increase its flexibility by removing the date of election from 7 years before the games, and changing the host from a single city/region/country to multiple cities, regions, or countries.\nFuture host winter commissions.\nThe full composition of the Winter Commissions, overseeing interested hosts or with potential hosts where the IOC may want to create interest, is as follows:\nDialogue stages.\nAccording to the Future Host Commission's rules of conduct, the new IOC bidding system is divided into 2 dialogue stages:\nContinuous dialogue.\n\"Non-committal discussions between the IOC and interested parties (City/Region/Country/NOC interested in hosting) with regard to hosting future Olympic events.\"\nDuring the Olympic Summit on 9 December 2022 the IOC informed to remain in \"Continuous Dialogue\" with several well-developed projects by parties that have expressed interest in the Olympic Winter Games 2030 and with whom intense collaboration is ongoing. The Summit was also informed that the Commission is looking into challenges and opportunities facing future Olympic Winter Games, such as the impact of climate change. A number of proposals which could have an impact on future elections were discussed, including rotation of the Games within a certain pool of hosts, minimum climate conditions and existing infrastructure criteria.\nUpon the request of the Commission, the IOC Executive Board decided to give the Commission more time to study all these factors to make the best possible decisions about future hosting, including a revised 2030 election timeframe.\nTargeted dialogue.\n\"Targeted discussions with one or more interested parties (called preferred host(s)), as instructed by the IOC Executive Board. This follows a recommendation by the Future Host Commission as a result of continuous dialogue.\"\nFollowing a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)'s Future Host Commission for the Olympic Winter Games, the IOC Executive Board (EB) on 29 November 2023 invited the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPCF) into \"Targeted Dialogue\" towards hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games 2034 in Salt Lake City.\nBidding parties.\nStakeholders.\nStakeholders are those cities or regions that have expressed potential interest in hosting the Games.\nPotential bids.\nIn December 2022, the German Olympic Sports Confederation annonced they would explore a bid for Munich to host the 2034 Winter Olympics and the 2036 Summer Olympics (although for the latter, Berlin would eventually be preferred for the German bid). If this bid was successful, this would be the second time an Olympic event would be held in Munich, with the city previously hosting the 1972 Summer Olympics. Munich previously bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, losing to Pyeongchang.\nOn 19 February 2023, Peter Kaiser, the governor of Carinthia, announced that plans for a joined bid by the austrian state of Carinthia, alongside Italian Region Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Slovenia. A similar bid had been proposed for the 2006 Winter Olympics, eventually losing to Turin. The prepartions for the bid were later confirmed by the Slovenian minister of sports, Matjaž Han. On 25 March, Italian politician and head of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Region, Massimiliano Fedriga confirmed these plans. On 11 April 2024, Peter Kaiser announced that a joint bid would be prepared for the 2028 Winter Youth Olympics. If selected, these Winter Youth Olympics would work as a test for an eventual hosting of the Winter Olympics."

Having already been achieved in mountain biking, BMX racing, and BMX freestyle on the Tokyo 2020 program, several significant changes are instituted in the road and track cycling, with some men's quota places transferred to the women's side and with the number of riders in women's team sprint increasing from two to three. Conforming to the recommendations of the International Olympic Committee's 2020 agenda, cycling will have fourteen fewer places at these Games than those in 2020, a reduction that affects road racing and mountain biking. Nonetheless, the distribution of an extra place for track cycling and six in BMX freestyle, with the number of athletes competing in the men's and women's events increasing from nine to twelve, partly counteracts the moderate decrease in the cycling spots offered at these Games.\nDespite the modest quota decrease, cycling will feature a total of twenty-two medal events across five disciplines, similar to the 2020 program format. While the sport continues to run on all days between the opening and closing ceremonies, Paris 2024 will witness some scheduling changes contrary to the previous edition; hence, the men's and women's individual time trial medalists will be awarded on the first day of the competition.\nQualification.\nAs the host country, France reserves a men's and women's quota place in BMX racing, BMX freestyle, and mountain biking; and two more in the men's and women's road races. If one or two French cyclists qualify directly and regularly, their spare slots will be reallocated to the next highest-ranked eligible NOCs in the aforementioned events based on the national order of the UCI World Ranking list by October 17, 2023.\nAbout ninety percent of the total quota places will be attributed through the UCI World Ranking lists of their respective disciplines, with some spots offered for the cyclists at the 2023 UCI World Championships and at the continental qualification tournaments (Africa, Asia, and the Americas).\nCompetition schedule.\nS=seeding"

        "title": "1930 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 1930 America's Cup was the 14th challenge for the Cup. It took place in Newport and consisted of a series of races between the defender \"Enterprise\", entered by a syndicate of New York Yacht Club members headed by Winthrop Aldrich, and \"Shamrock V\", the fifth in Sir Thomas Lipton's line of Cup challengers.\nBackground.\nOn May 5, 1929, Sir Thomas Lipton issued a new challenge for the America's Cup, including details of his challenging yacht, \"Shamrock V\". Like its predecessors, \"Shamrock V\" had been built by Charles Nicholson, with Lipton telling him that this time \"the Americans ... would be just as pleased as anyone else to see me win.\"\nThe challenge was unanimously accepted at a special meeting of the New York Yacht Club on May 16. At the same meeting, the club decided to form two syndicates to build one yacht each for the defense of the cup, and also to welcome other syndicates who might want to offer a defender. The two syndicates formed directly by the NYYC were to be led by Vice-Commodore Winthrop Aldrich and Rear-Commodore Junius Morgan. They were joined by a third New York syndicate headed by and managed by Landon K. Thorne and a fourth syndicate that was nominally attached to the NYYC for the purpose of eligibility for the race, but was composed of members of Boston's Eastern Yacht Club.\nDuring May and June, the NYYC and RUYC negotiated the conditions of the challenge. Changes to the terms of the competition since the previous challenge of 1920 included:\nThe implications of this final point were that the challenger would not be disadvantaged by having a hull built strong enough to meet the current safety standards for a trans-Atlantic crossing (and therefore heavier than the previous generation of racing yachts), and that it would also preclude the yachts \"Resolute\" and \"Vanitie\" from defending the Cup. Both had been built to defend the Cup in the 1914 challenge (postponed and raced in 1920), with \"Resolute\" winning. However, neither \"Resolute\" nor \"Vanitie\" were built sturdily enough to meet the new regulations, therefore requiring the construction of new yachts for the defense.\nThe relocation to Newport was to accommodate the tall masts of the J-class; too tall to pass under many of the bridges over the East River.\nAdditionally, the Cup Committee specified that to be evaluated as a defender, yachts would need to have at least one spare mast constructed. This stipulation was made because of the eleven previous yachts built for evaluation as Cup defenders in previous years, five had lost their masts at some point.\nAldrich's syndicate named Harold S. Vanderbilt as their captain and engaged Starling Burgess to design their yacht and Herreshoff Manufacturing Company to build it. They would name their yacht \"Enterprise\". Morgan's syndicate also commissioned Herreshoff to build their yacht, and gave it the name \"Weetamoe\". Two other contenders for the defense of the Cup, \"Whirlwind\", and \"Yankee\" were built by Lawley &amp; Son.\nOver $3 million was spent on building the four contenders, around $1 million of this on \"Enterprise\" alone (around $54 million and $18 million in 2022 dollars).\nIn a major departure from previous competitions, the various contenders were quite open with each other about their designs and approaches, replacing the secrecy with which the designs had been treated in the past.\nDefense contender pre-trial races.\nPrior to the formal selection trials, the four yachts competing to become the Cup defender raced numerous times between June and August 1930.\nThe Long Island Sound series.\nOn June 9, the contenders, together with \"Resolute\" and \"Vanitie\", met at Glen Cove for a series of races planned in Long Island Sound by the local clubs.\nA huge flotilla of spectator craft attended the first of these races, including some 200 small motorboats, and two large steamers chartered by the New York Yacht Club. About a dozen Coast Guard motorboats were stationed to keep the course clear, however wakes from some of the spectator boats caused a minor disruption to the race as the yachts crossed them.\nOf the series, \"Weetamoe\" won three out of four races, with the other going to \"Enterprise\". \"Yankee\" arrived too late to compete in any but the fourth and last race.\nA fifth race in the series had been proposed for June 18 off Stamford, but was abandoned due to lack of entries.\nPoints from races towards the racing season were awarded on the basis of: 1 point for starting a race, plus 1 point for each boat defeated. Therefore, at the end of this series, the points collected were:\nThe Eastern Yacht Club races.\nThe following week, the J-class boats traveled to Newport for three races organized by the Eastern Yacht Club. Once again, a large spectator fleet attended the first race, including a steamer that the sponsoring club had brought from Boston.\nThe first race proved eventful when \"Weetamoe\" failed to give way as required to \"Enterprise\" leeward of her while they were maneuvering towards the start line (see Racing Rules of Sailing). This caused the latter boat to stand off to avoid a collision and immediately signal a protest. Although \"Weetamoe\" finished the race first, her skipper acknowledged the foul and withdrew, leaving \"Enterprise\" the winner.\nIn the second race, while \"Enterprise\" led the other boats towards the second mark, her crew spotted a buoy with a red flag that appeared to them identical to the first mark they had already rounded. Although about two miles from where they were expecting to find it, they believed this to be the second mark and turned. The other five boats followed. Only after the finish of the race were the crews informed by the Race Committee that they had all turned at the wrong point and that the second buoy had been a fishing trawl buoy. However, since all competitors had made the same mistake, and acknowledging the similarity of the buoys, the committee decided to let the race stand.\nThe results of the races were:\nThe points won by the contestants for America's Cup defender during these races were:\nAs winner of the races, \"Enterprise\" was awarded the Commodore Charles P. Curtiss cup, and a second prize was awarded to \"Yankee\".\nObservation.\nDuring the first two weeks of July 1930, the America's Cup Committee staged a series of observation races to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the four contenders to defend the cup. The races were conducted by starting the yachts in pairs, with the second pair starting fifteen minutes after the first. The yachts to race in each pair were determined by lot.\nIn all, ten of these races were staged between July 7 and July 17, although due to weather and mechanical failures, not every race could be completed. A further two races had been scheduled for July 18 and 19 but were not conducted.\nThe first four races proceeded without incident, with \"Weetamoe\" recording four wins, \"Enterprise\" two, and \"Whirlwind\" and \"Yankee\" one each.\nIn the fifth race, on July 11, \"Enterprise\" and \"Weetamoe\" competed in the first division. During the first leg of the race, \"Weetamoe\"s mainsail failed, forcing her to withdraw from the race. The committee then signalled \"Enterprise\" to withdraw as well, thereby granting \"Enterprise\" a technical victory.\nThe sixth race, on July 12, was marred by very light winds. The start time was delayed by 2½ hours before there was even enough wind for the competitors to get underway, and when \"Enterprise\" and \"Whirlwind\" started in the second division, the yachts of the first division were less than a mile ahead. By the time \"Enterprise\" rounded the second mark, she was ahead of not only \"Whirlwind\", but the other two yachts as well. The America's Cup rules of the time specified that if neither boat in a race had finished the course in 5½ hours, the race would be declared void. Therefore, on this day, the first division race was voided for this reason: \"Weetamoe\" crossed the line only after 5 hours 44 minutes, leading \"Yankee\", which was awarded a \"did not finish\". In the second division, \"Enterprise\" completed the race with just over 1½ minutes left to spare, meaning that the race was still valid and earning \"Whirlwind\" a second place even though she took 6 hours 10 minutes to complete the course.\nWeather on the day of race seven, July 14, was quite the opposite: overcast and a 22-knot wind blowing. \"Enterprise\" raced \"Weetamoe\" in the first division, both yachts with their mailsails reefed. \"Enterprise\"s mainsail tore, forcing her to withdraw from the race, and giving \"Weetamoe\" a technical victory. Something similar happened in the second division where both yachts were running under full sail: the headboard tore out of \"Whirlwind\"s mainsail, forcing her withdrawal and granting technical victory to \"Yankee\". No yacht actually completed the course that day.\nThe wind died again on the day of race eight, July 15. \"Whirlwind\" and \"Yankee\" were taking lay days, so only \"Enterprise\" and \"Weetamoe\" raced. Even so, the wind was so poor that the committee canceled the race after 1½ hours.\nRace 9, on July 16, proceeded without incident, but for race 10, on July 17, \"Whirlwind\" was once again not available. The Cup Committee therefore decided to hold a three-way race for the other yachts. Other than the participation of an extra competitor, this race was also without incident.\nA final two observation races were cancelled.\nThe end results of the observations were that \"Enterprise\", \"Weetamoe\", and \"Yankee\" all finished roughly the same, points-wise (14, 13, and 13 respectively), while \"Whirlwind\" had won only a single race and finished with only 8 points. \"Weetamoe\" won every race that she had finished.\nThe results of the races were:\nThe points won by the contestants for America's Cup defender during these races were:\nNew York Yacht Club annual cruise.\nFrom August 2–9, the 1930 annual cruise of the New York Yacht Club offered a final opportunity for the contenders for the defense of the America's Cup to compete with each other prior to the selection trials.\nThe first leg of the cruise, on August 2, was a 37½-mile race from New London to Newport. At the start of the race, \"Enterprise\" signalled a protest that \"Yankee\" had fouled her. Following the race, the Race Committee upheld the protest and disqualified \"Yankee\", which had finished last in any case. \"Weetamoe\" won this leg, defeating \"Enterprise\" by three minutes.\nThe next leg was raced on August 4, a 31½-mile run from Newport to Mattapoisett. This leg was won by \"Yankee\", with \"Enterprise\" again in second place, this time by only 20 seconds. \"Weetamoe\" lost about 30 minutes to recovering a man overboard.\nOn August 5, a special race for the defender candidates was held in Buzzard's Bay on a 21-mile triangular course. This time, \"Enterprise\" won, with all four yachts finishing within 5 minutes of each other.\nOn August 6, participants in the cruise raced 37½ miles from Mattapoisett to Vineyard Haven. Early in the race, \"Weetamoe\" fouled \"Whirlwind\", which had to bear away to avoid a collision. \"Weetamoe\" immediately withdrew from the race but continued to sail the course in order to reach the next port.\nThe final port-to-port leg of the cruise was raced the next day, August 7, 37 miles from Vineyard Haven to Newport. \"Enterprise\" won this leg, but a few days after the race, a question of rules came up about her use of two spinnakers at one point during the race. All four yachts had been running with spinnakers to starboard, but while maneuvering, \"Enterprise\" had raised her port spinnaker before dropping her starboard spinnaker. When asked for a ruling, the Race Committee interpreted the Racing Rules to mean that a yacht could only sail with one spinnaker at a time. On the basis of this determination, \"Enterprise\"s crew withdrew her from the race, which then went to \"Weetamoe\".\nOn August 8, the four contender yachts all participated in the Astor Cup, a 15-mile windward and leeward course. Confusion arose as the yachts approached the finish because they had been instructed to finish with the Newport lightship to starboard, but also to finish between the lightship and the committee boat. However, due to a mechanical falure, the committee boat was anchored in the wrong position, and finishing between it and the lightship would mean finishing with the lightship to port. \"Weetamoe\", in the lead, did just this, but the crew of \"Enterprise\" reasoned that the only way to satisfy the course instructions was to round the lightship and cross the finish line from the other direction, which they did and signalled a protest. The Race Committee upheld the protest, and disqualified \"Weetamoe\" for not finishing the course, giving the race to \"Enterprise\".\nThe final race of the cruise was sailed on August 9, the City of Newport Cup. Again, confusion arose, this time because two other races were being held on the same day, and visibility on the course was not good. \"Whirlwind\" completely missed one of the marks and continued sailing past it, and \"Enterprise\" turned at a buoy that had been set for a different race and lost considerable time getting back on course. The race went to \"Weetamoe\".\nThe results of the races were:\nThe points won by the contestants for America's Cup defender during these races were:\nTrials.\nFormal trials between the four contenders commenced on August 20, \"to continue until the Cup Committee had selected a Defender for the America's Cup\". The contenders were to race in pairs, the second division starting 15 minutes after the first division, as in the observation races.\nThe first race was to be a 30-mile leeward-and-windward course. In the first division, \"Enterprise\" and \"Weetamoe\" raced neck-and-neck throughout the race and finished only 31 seconds apart, with \"Enterprise\" the winner. \"Yankee\" won the second division after \"Whirlwind\" became disabled.\nThe second race, the next day, was a 30-mile triangular course, with the yachts in the same divisions as in the first race. The wind was strong and \"Weetamoe\" sailed with her mainsail reefed. A mechanical failure aboard \"Enterprise\" nearly forced her to withdraw, but Burgess was aboard and was able to devise a jury-rigged repair to keep her in the race. Even so, \"Enterprise\" won her division, and in doing so, also the all-time record for the 30-mile course that had been set by \"Columbia\" in 1901. \"Enterprise\"s record stood for about 13 minutes before being broken again by \"Yankee\" winning the second division.\nTrial races on August 25 and 26 were both abandoned when the contenders lay becalmed at the start line for hours.\nA final trial race was attempted on August 27, with \"Weetamoe\" racing \"Whirlwind\" in division 1 and \"Enterprise\" racing \"Whirlwind\" in division 2 on a 30-mile leeward-and-return course. However, during the race, the wind died and with no hope of the yachts completing the course within the 5½-hour time limit, the Race Committee called off the race.\nThat same evening, the America's Cup Committee informed the afterguard of \"Enterprise\" that their yacht had been selected to defend the cup.\nThe results of the trial races were:\nThe points won by the contestants for America's Cup defender during these races were:\nCompetition.\nThe first race between \"Shamrock V\" and \"Enterprise\" took place on September 13, a 15-mile leeward-and-windward course. The start was postponed by an hour due to lack of wind. The race was uneventful, other than the Coast Guard having to move some sightseeing steamers so as not to cut the wind for the race. \"Enterprise\" won by almost three minutes.\nThe second race, on September 15, was a triangular course, 10 miles to each leg. This proved to be an even more decisive victory for \"Enterprise\", of nearly 10 minutes.\nThe third race, on September 17, 15 miles windward and return, was the most eventful of the series. The way in which \"Shamrock V\" maneuvered at the start of the race raised several questions under the Racing Rules. However, trusting that \"Enterprise\" was the faster yacht anyway under the prevailing conditions, her crew chose simply to remain clear of \"Shamrock V\" and not risk a protest. The point became academic anyway, when 44 minutes into the race, \"Shamrock V\"s main halyard broke, causing her mainsail to collapse and forcing her to withdraw from the race. \"Enterprise\" went on to complete the course and secure a victory.\nThe fourth race, on September 18, was again a triangular course, 10 miles to each leg. \"Enterprise\" established an early lead of nine minutes on the first leg. Although \"Shamrock V\" was able to close that lead to only five minutes by the end of the race, she still finished around half a mile behind \"Enterprise\". Lipton was heard to say \"I can't win, I can't win\" Having won four races, \"Enterprise\" had successfully defended the America's Cup.\nThe results of the four races were:"

        "text": "Gymnastics Canada is the national governing body for the sport of gymnastics in Canada and has its current headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario. It is responsible for the organization and promotion of gymnastics on a nationwide basis.\nIn 1956, a Canadian delegation attended its first world-level International Gymnastics Federation FIG (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique) competition in Melbourne with only one male gymnast, Ed Gagnier, and one female gymnast, Ernestine Russell. This marked the beginning of Canada's participation in international competitions, signalling an important step towards development of their national team program.\nIn Canada, gymnastics is a part of the Canada Games programme. Gymnastics is said to have been originally practiced in ancient Greek civilization, evolving over time into a more structured form of exercise and recreation. Through running, jumping, swimming, throwing, wrestling and weightlifting exercises, gymnastics promotes physical strength as well as intellectual development by developing balance, coordination and rhythm.\nControversy.\nIn 2023, the McLaren Report sparked a move to change the leadership of the organization. Gymnastics Canada CEO Ian Moss left the organization while the board stated it would work together with him to ensure a \"smooth transition\" for the next CEO. Following the resignation of Jeff Thomson earlier in February 2023, the organization began searching for a new chairperson to lead its board of directors, an integral role for advancing and fulfilling its new mission objectives. Thomson was replaced by vice-chair Petoit on an interim basis."

        "text": "The 1947–48 MIT Engineers men's ice hockey season was the 45th season of play for the program but first under the oversight of the NCAA. The Engineers represent the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and were coached by Al Carvelli in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nMIT entered the season by putting together the most expansive slate of games in program history. The Engineers were scheduled to play 19 matches, 14 of which coming against NEIHL opponents. With most of the games being played at the Boston Arena, MIT could at least be assured that weather would not impact their season too severely.\nThe Beavers played their first match in early December but had to do so without two of their star players as both Ed Thompson and Don Lea were both injured. Without the standout forwards, MIT had to rely on its defense and team captain Jack Clifford led the way to a pair of victories after opening the year with a loss.\nThe following week, MIT was putting forth a tremendous performance against Northeastern despite missing three forwards. Don Lea was back in action and had paced the Engineers to a 4–2 lead. Unfortunately, he reinjured his twisted ankle in the second period while Tom Tsotsi was ejected after a fight. Short five regulars in the final period, MIT could not keep up the scoring pace and fell to the Huskies. The lack of offense was keenly felt in the next game when the Techmen were bowled over by Boston University 0–7. Lea fought through his injury and returned for the match against Boston College. He proved to be pivotal in the team attempted comeback after falling down 1–4 in the first. He scored twice to pull the Engineers into a tie with the vaunted Eagles but BC played a stingy brand of defense thereafter and managed to grind out two goals to capture the match.\nAfter returning from the winter break, the Engineers had recovered from their various ailments and ice a full team for the first time that season. The result was a commanding victory over Suffolk with Clifford pacing all players with 7 points (4 g, 3 a). The offense got a bit too loose in the next game and, despite scoring 5 goals, missed the net with 50 attempts. The unconverted opportunities led to MIT's 4th-consecutive conference loss and put the Engineers in a nearly impossible position for making the NEIHL playoffs. To add injury to insult, Tsotsi was checked hard into the boards and was knocked unconscious for 20 minutes. He was sent to the Homberg Infirmary where he recovered.\nThe following week, MIT rallied to score two conference victories in convincing fashion. They followed that up with a win over Fort Devens State to lift them up to an even record. However, those would be the final games for captain Clifford as he graduated after the fall semester.\nAfter returning from the break, the team felt Clifford's absence on both sides of the ice as neither the offense nor the defense were performing at the same level. The team knew it still needed to finish strong if it wanted to have a shot at the postseason berth, but losing the very next game to Bowdoin dealt a mortal blow to those chances. MIT's forwards were able to band together to overcome Clifford's loss; however, the defense was never able to fully recover and caused the Engineers to lose their last three conference matches. The defeats dropped MIT to 5th place, just 1 behind Bowdoin for the final playoff berth.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"
