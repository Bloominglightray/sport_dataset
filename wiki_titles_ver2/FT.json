        "title": "Derrick White (basketball)",
        "text": "Derrick Richard White (born July 2, 1994) is an American professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played three years of college basketball in Division II for the UCCS Mountain Lions before transferring to the Division I Colorado Buffaloes for his final year.\nWhite was selected 29th overall by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2017 NBA draft. In February 2022, he was traded to the Celtics and became a key contributor for the team when they reached the NBA Finals.\nHigh school career.\nWhite attended Legend High School, a brand new high school in Parker, Colorado, and was a part of its first graduating class. As a freshman on the basketball team, he played with 11 other freshman en route to one win in league play. As a senior, White averaged 17.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 2.1 steals per game.\nWhite scored over 1,000 points in his career. At the time of his graduation in 2012, he was a six-foot combo guard. On February 17, 2023, White was honored as the first-ever Legend athletics hall of fame inductee.\nCollege career.\nWhite was lightly recruited out of high school, receiving no scholarship offers from any four-year institutions. At the time of his high school graduation, which fell about two months before his 18th birthday, he was barely 6 feet tall—after growing two inches during his senior year. The only head coach at a four-year school who showed sustained interest in White was Jeff Culver, then the head coach at the Denver campus of Johnson &amp; Wales University, a non-scholarship NAIA member better known for its culinary program. By the time White was preparing to make his college decision, Culver was hired as head coach at NCAA Division II UCCS, and offered White a room and board stipend for his freshman season. Culver was only expecting White to become a starter late in his college career. He was aware that White's father had a late growth spurt in college, and also knew that doctors had projected White to potentially reach 6'5\". As it turned out, White reached that potential height by the time he enrolled at Colorado–Colorado Springs. With his newfound size and athleticism, White became a star at UCCS, starting every game of his three-year career and left as the school's career leader in points (1,912) and assists (343). In his junior season, he averaged 25.8 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.2 assists for the Mountain Lions, leading the team to the 2015 NCAA tournament. He was named an All-American.\nFollowing this season, White opted to transfer to Division I Colorado to play for Tad Boyle and to test his skills in the Pac-12 Conference, one of the top college leagues in the country. After sitting out the 2015–16 season per NCAA rules, White excelled in his lone season with the Buffaloes, averaging 18.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game. He was named first-team All-Pac-12 and a member of the five-man All-Defensive team.\nProfessional career.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2017–2022).\nWhite was one of 60 NBA prospects invited to the 2017 NBA Draft Combine. He was one of only 15 combine invitees who had not been Rivals top-150 prospects in high school, and one of only three who did not sign with Division I programs out of high school. In addition, according to Yahoo! Sports writer Jeff Eisenberg, he was also \"the only one who will use part of his first NBA contract to pay off student loans he accumulated paying for tuition at UCCS as a freshman.\"\nThe San Antonio Spurs drafted White with the 29th pick of the 2017 NBA draft. White was later included in the Spurs' 2017 NBA Summer League roster. On July 6, White signed with the Spurs.\nOn October 18, 2017, White made his NBA debut, coming off the bench in a 107–99 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. On October 31, 2017, he was sent along with Dāvis Bertāns to the Austin Spurs of the NBA G League. White suffered a fractured right wrist during a G League game against the Texas Legends. He was then recalled to San Antonio several days later. On March 12, 2018, White scored a career-high 14 points along with four rebounds, one assist, and a block in a 93-109 loss to the Houston Rockets.\nOn April 14, 2018, White made his NBA playoffs debut, coming off the bench with seven points, an assist, a steal, and a block in a 92–113 loss to the Golden State Warriors in game 1 of the series.\nOn October 12, 2018, White was revealed to have a left plantar fascia tear. On November 7, White made his season debut recording one rebound and three assists in a 95–88 loss to the Miami Heat. On December 31, White scored his career-high 22 points with three rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal in a 120–111 win over the Boston Celtics. On January 10, 2019, White scored another career-high 23 points with eight assists, five rebounds, two steals and a block in a double-overtime 154–147 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 30, 2019 against the Brooklyn Nets, White then recorded a then career-high 26 points. On April 18, 2019, against the Denver Nuggets, White recorded another career-high of 36 points to give San Antonio a 2–1 lead in the first round of the 2019 playoffs.\nOn December 21, 2020, the Spurs announced that they had signed White to a reported four-year, $73 million rookie scale extension. On April 1, 2021, White hit a career-high seven three-pointers in a 129–134 double overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks.\nBoston Celtics (2022–present).\nOn February 10, 2022, White was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Josh Richardson, Romeo Langford, a 2022 first-round pick (which turned into Blake Wesley) and the rights to swap 2028 first-round picks. White played his first game with the Celtics a day later and finished with 15 points, 6 rebounds and 2 assists.\nDuring Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Miami Heat, White scored 22 points on 7-for-14 shooting, alongside five assists and three steals, in a 111–103 loss. The Celtics would go on to eliminate the Heat, earning White his first Finals appearance in his career. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, he logged 21 points and three assists in a 120–108 victory over the Golden State Warriors. The Celtics went on to lose the series in six games despite a 2–1 lead.\nWhite began the 2022-23 season as a starter for the Celtics. On February 10, he scored a then-career-high 33 points against the Charlotte Hornets in a 127–116 victory. Three days later on February 13, 2023, White was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week, after averaging 24.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists as a starter in place of the injured Marcus Smart. \nIn Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, White made a buzzer-beating put-back shot as time expired to narrowly beat the Miami Heat 104–103 to force a Game 7, saving the Celtics from elimination. White became the second player in NBA history to hit a buzzer-beating game-winner with his team trailing and facing elimination, joining Michael Jordan's \"The Shot\" in 1989. The Celtics went on to lose Game 7 at home, 84–103, in which White had 18 points.\nDuring the 2022-23 season, White started 70 games and appeared in all 82 regular season games, both career highs. He also shot 38.1% from three and 87.5% from the free throw line, both being career highs. His 76 blocked shots were also career high. In May, White was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second team for the first time.\nOn March 18, 2024, White put up his first career triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 119–94 victory over the Detroit Pistons. On April 29, White registered a career-high 38 points in a 102–88 road victory against the Heat in Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs.\nNational team career.\nOn August 24, 2019, White was included in the US national team's final roster for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nPersonal life.\nWhite married Hannah Schneider in August 2021. Their first son, Hendrix James, who is named for Jimi Hendrix, was born on May 19, 2022. Their second son, Daxton, was born on November 4, 2023."

        "title": "FIFA Women's World Cup hosts",
        "text": "Eight countries have been chosen FIFA Women's World Cup hosts in the competition's nine editions from the inaugural tournament in 1991 until the tournament played in 2023.\nHistory.\nThe decision to hold the first tournament in China was made by FIFA, football's international governing body, after China hosted a prototype world championship three years earlier, the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament. The first Women's World Cup was sponsored by Mars, Incorporated. With FIFA still reluctant to bestow their \"World Cup\" brand, the tournament was officially known as the 1st FIFA World Championship for Women's Football for the M&amp;M's Cup.\nOnly China and the United States have hosted the event on more than one occasion. The 2003 edition was originally awarded to China, but was moved to the United States in May 2003 due to the SARS outbreak. China were instead awarded the right to host the following edition in 2007.\n1991 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBid:\nFIFA selected China to host the inaugural FIFA Women's World Cup as Guangdong had hosted a prototype world championship three years earlier, the 1988 FIFA Women's Invitation Tournament. \nResult:\n1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBid:\nBulgaria was selected to host the 1995 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nResult:\nHowever, Bulgaria had to relinquish their hosting rights by FIFA due to practical reasons.\nFIFA approached Euro 1992 hosts Sweden at short notice to organise the event.\nFIFA later decided to move the tournament to Sweden. As a result, Sweden became the first nation to hold both the men's and women's World Cups, having hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup\nResult:\n1999 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nThe United States Soccer Federation announced their intention to bid for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup in February 1995, shortly after hosting the successful 1994 FIFA World Cup. Australia and Chile both announced their intention to bid but withdrew from the process in December 1995. This left the United States as the sole applicant by the March 1996 deadline for bids. The FIFA Executive Committee officially awarded hosting rights to the United States on May 31, 1996, the same day that the 2002 FIFA World Cup was jointly awarded to Japan and South Korea.\nResult:\n2003 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nThe Australia Soccer Federation began bidding for the tournament in 1998 and was solely unopposed by the time of the bidding deadline. However, FIFA President at the time, Sepp Blatter, expressed his intentions of bringing the tournament back to China, which hosted the inaugural tournament in 1991. Little interest was shown by the Chinese Football Association however FIFA awarded the hosting rights to China.\nResult:\nSeveral sporting events in China were canceled or postponed in early April due to the outbreak of SARS in southern China, and FIFA launched a joint investigation with the World Health Organization into whether the outbreak would subside by the time of the tournament. On May 3, 2003, FIFA announced that they would move the tournament to an alternate host country, which would be determined at a later date.\nBids:\nThe United States and Australia had expressed interest in hosting, while Brazil was floated as another potential host. On May 26, 2003, the United States was announced as the tournament's new host, ahead of the other formal bid submitted by Sweden. The United States was judged to be a suitable emergency host because of their experience with organizing the 1999 tournament.\nChina was subsequently awarded the hosting rights to the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup by FIFA, as well as $1 million to the organizing committee to compensate for planning expenses.\nResult:\n2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nOriginally, China was to host the 2003 edition, but the outbreak of SARS in that country forced that event to be moved to the United States. FIFA immediately granted the 2007 event to China, which meant that no new host nation was chosen competitively until the following tournament in 2011.\nResult:\n2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nSix nations, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Peru and Switzerland, initially declared their interest in hosting the 2011 Women's World Cup. The German Football Association announced its hopes to host the tournament on 26 January 2006, following a pledge from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to fully support a potential bid. All six nations officially announced their interest by a 1 March 2007 deadline and acknowledged their intention of bidding by 3 May 2007 to FIFA.\nSwitzerland withdrew on 29 May 2007, stating that Europe is heavily focused on France and Germany, and a third European bid appeared futile. On 27 August 2007, France also withdrew, reportedly in exchange for Germany's support for their bid to host the men's UEFA Euro 2016. Later Australia and Peru voluntarily dropped out of the race as well, leaving only Canada and Germany as the remaining candidates. On 30 October 2007, the FIFA Executive Committee voted to assign the tournament to Germany. Canada was eventually awarded the 2015 Women's World Cup four years later.\nUpon the selection, Germany became the third country to host both men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's twice in 1974 and 2006.\nResult:\n2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nTwo bids were submitted from the Canadian Soccer Association and Zimbabwe Football Association in December 2010. Zimbabwe withdrew its bid on 1 March 2011. The country was seen as a long shot as its women's team was ranked 103rd in the world at the time of the bid and has never qualified for a Women's World Cup. There was also ongoing political and economic instability in the country. Canada were subsequently awarded the hosting rights for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup as the sole bidder.\n2019 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nInitially, five countries indicated interest in hosting the events: France, England, South Korea, New Zealand and South Africa. Both England and New Zealand registered expressions of interest by the April 2014 deadline, but in June 2014 it was announced that each would no longer proceed. South Africa registered an expression of interest by the April 2014 deadline; but later decided to withdraw prior to the final October deadline. Both Japan and Sweden had also expressed interest in bidding for the 2019 tournament, but Japan chose to focus on the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics, whilst Sweden decided to focus on European U-17 competitions instead. France and South Korea made official bids for hosting the tournament by submitting their documents by 31 October 2014.\nOn 19 March 2015, France officially won the bid to host the Women's World Cup along with the U-20 Women's World Cup. The decision came after a vote by the FIFA Executive Committee. Upon the selection, France became the third European nation to host the Women's World Cup (following Sweden and Germany), and the fourth country to host both the men's and women's World Cup, having hosted the men's tournament in 1938 and 1998.\n2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nNine countries initially indicated interest in hosting the events: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, South Korea (with interest in a joint bid with North Korea), New Zealand and South Africa. Belgium expressed interest in hosting the tournament following the new deadline but later dropped out, as did Bolivia, in September 2019. Australia and New Zealand later announced they would merge their bids in a joint submission. Brazil, Colombia, and Japan joined them in submitting their bid books to FIFA by 13 December. However, both Brazil and Japan later withdrew their bids in June 2020 before the final voting.\nOn 25 June 2020, Australia and New Zealand won the bid to host the Women's World Cup. The decision came after a vote by the FIFA Council, with the winning bid earning 22 votes, while Colombia earned 13. Neither country had previously hosted a senior FIFA tournament.\n2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nBids:\nThe bidding process for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup began on 23 March 2023, with the host appointment scheduled for the FIFA Congress on 27 May 2024. This marks the first time in Women's World Cup history that the appointment of host will be decided by the FIFA Congress. Four bids were submitted by the second deadline on 19 May 2023. Three bids from Chile, Italy and a joint bid between the Nordic nations (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) expressed interest but later withdrew before the deadline.\nThe football associations of Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands announced their intention to jointly bid for the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup. Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the UEFA European Championship in 2000, with Belgium having previously hosted in 1972. Germany hosted the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011 and the UEFA European Women's Championship in 2001. Germany also hosted the FIFA Men's World Cup in 1974 and 2006, the men's Euro in 1988, and will do so again in 2024. Germany and the Netherlands co-hosted several matches in the multi-national UEFA Euro 2020. The Netherlands hosted the Women's Euro in 2017.\nThe South African Football Association previously submitted a bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, but withdrew its bid in December 2019. SAFA CEO Hay Mokoena stated that South Africa would consider bidding for 2027 after the women's league and national team become more competitive. South Africa has hosted the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup and could use the infrastructure that was built for the tournament. In September 2022, South Africa announced its bid to host the 2027 women's edition. They later withdrew in November 2023 and decided to focus on bidding for 2031 tournament instead. \nThe Brazilian Football Confederation expressed interest in participating in the election for the 2027 World Cup. The country was one of the finalists for the 2023 edition, but had to withdraw due to the lack of support from the federal government, in addition to the financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 2 March 2023, CBF President Ednaldo Rodrigues sent a letter to FIFA, confirming the country's intention to compete in the 2027 World Cup. On 7 March the Brazilian Minister of Sports, Ana Moser, confirmed the country's bid to host the tournament.\nFormer U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro expressed an interest in the U.S. hosting the tournament, stating \"I believe we can and should host the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027.\" The United States has previously hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and this tournament twice in a row in 1999 and 2003. It was reported on 6 August 2021 that U.S. Soccer was considering a bid for the 2031 Women's World Cup as an alternative before reinstating its plan for 2027 on 17 June 2022. On 21 June 2022, the president of the Mexican Football Federation, Yon de Luisa, announced interests in hosting the 2027 edition and would seek to make a bid for it. A joint bid between the United States and Mexico was announced on 19 April 2023 prior to a friendly match between the men's teams. On 29 April 2024, the U.S. and Mexico announced that they would withdraw their bid for the 2027 edition, instead focusing on bidding to host in 2031.\n2031 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe bidding process for the Women's World Cup is yet to begin. Some early bids for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup however have been proposed. The host nation for the 2031 Women's World Cup is scheduled to be decided by the FIFA Congress in the second quarter of 2025, a year after the host selection for the 2027 edition, with bid regulations for approval in the second quarter of 2024. China was the first to express interest in hosting the event. In October 2022, the Chinese Football Association and the nation's sports ministry announced a new women's football program that would include a bid to host the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup. China previously hosted the 1991 tournament and the 2007 tournament after the 2003 tournament had to be relocated to the United States due to the SARS outbreak. \nThe second bid is from England. In May 2023, the English Football Association announced their intention to bid following the success of their women's team at the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 and the large attendance at Wembley Stadium for the 2022 Women's FA Cup final. This would be England's first time hosting the women's tournament, though they have significant hosting experience including the 1966 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1996, UEFA Women's Euro 2005 and UEFA Women's Euro 2022, plus several matches of UEFA Euro 2020. \n2035 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nSaudi Arabia was the first bid to announce their interest in hosting the 2035 FIFA Women's World Cup following their successful 2034 FIFA World Cup bid and the launch of the Saudi Women's Premier League.\nTotal bids by country.\nWomen's World Cup-winning bids are bolded. Withdrawn bids are \"italicized\". Rejected bids, as well as planned but not-yet-official bids for 2031 and beyond, are not included."

The winner joined 19 teams already qualified by way of their domestic league position in the pool stage of the competition - a home and away round-robin for five groups of four teams. Following the pool stage, five pool winners, and three highest ranked runners-up, qualified for the quarter-finals of the competition, as the Cup thereafter reverted to a single elimination knockout format.\nThe tournament began on 13 October 2017. The final was won by Leinster on 12 May 2018 at San Mamés Stadium in Bilbao, Spain. This was Leinster's fourth title, tying the record for the most successful team in the competition's history. This was the first time the final was held outside one of the Six Nations countries.\nTeams.\nTwenty clubs from the three major European domestic and regional leagues competed in the Champions Cup. Nineteen of these qualified directly as a result of their league performance.\nThe distribution of teams was:\nThe following teams qualified for the 2017–18 tournament.\n20th team play-off.\nThe play-off system that had been suspended the season before, due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, returned to decide the final team competing in the Champions Cup.\nFour clubs competed in a play-off to decide the final team in the Champions Cup.\nThe play-off comprised 3 matches, contested by one team from the Aviva Premiership, one from the Top 14, and two from the Guinness Pro12.\nThe two Pro12 teams played either the Premiership or Top 14 side in a single-leg semi-final, held at the home ground of the non-Pro12 side. The winners of these matches then played in a play-off final, and the winner of this match took the 20th place in the Champions Cup. The three losing teams will all compete in the 2017–18 European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nThe following teams took part:\nMatches.\nA draw was held on 15 March 2017 to determine the two semi-final matches, and the semi-final winner that would have home advantage in the final.\nSemi-finals\nPlay-off final\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe twenty competing teams are seeded and split into four tiers, each containing five teams.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, clubs are ranked based on their domestic league performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nBased on these seedings, teams are placed into one of the four tiers, with the top seed clubs being put in Tier 1. The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1 and to allocate one of the three fourth seed clubs to Tier 2. The tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 8 June 2017, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. \nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, at home and away, in the group stage that begins on the weekend of 13/14/15 October 2017, and continues through to 19/20/21 January 2018. The five pool winners and three best runners-up progress to the quarter finals.\nTeams are awarded group points based on match performances. Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe eight qualifiers were ranked according to their performance in the pool stage and competed in the quarter-finals which were held on the weekend of 30/31 March, 1 April 2018. The four top teams were at home in the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 20/21/22 April 2018. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\". Semi-final matches must be played at a neutral ground in the designated home team's country.\nHome country advantage was awarded as follows:"

The first nine holes were designed by eminent golf course architect Devereux Emmet in 1927, with the remaining nine made by City of Hartford engineer Robert ”Jack” Ross in 1931.\nHistory.\nDiscussions of building a golf course in Keney Park began as early as 1916 as a means to alleviate congestion in Hartford's Goodwin Park. Goodwin Park was the city's only public golf course at the time, and there was a growing consensus that a new course would help reduce the crowds at Goodwin and improve the skill-set of Hartford players by creating a more challenging course. The course opened on October 13, 1927 at 35 cents for nine holes and 50 cents for 18. Devereux Emmet designed the first nine holes at a cost of $1,500 to the city, Hartford solicited Robert Ross, a city-engineer, to design the remaining nine holes, which premiered on August 29, 1930.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Keney park entered a period of decline and mismanagement which culminated in the city terminating their existing manager and launching a comprehensive refurbishment of the course and club house with the assistance of the Connecticut PGA. Since the refurbishment, the course has received numerous accolades, such as tying for first place in Golf Inc.'s 2016 Public Course Renovation list and being rated 2017's third best public course in the state by Golfweek.\nFacilities.\nThe Keney Park Club House was designed by Smith &amp; Bassette, a local firm based in Hartford, Connecticut. The Club House contains the pro shop and a restaurant, \"The Tavern at Keney Park\"."

It was run on November 7, 2009, at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California with a purse of $5,000,000.\nFor the first time in the race's history, a mare won when Zenyatta closed from last place to win by a length. The race was named the NTRA Moment of the Year.\nThe Classic is run at a distance of one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is normally run on a dirt surface but in 2009 was run on a synthetic surface. It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nIn 2008, European-based horses finished one-two in the Classic, a result that many attributed to the synthetic surface used at Santa Anita. California had adopted synthetic surfaces starting in 2007 due to safety concerns but many horsemen and bettors felt that the synthetics performed more like turf than dirt. As a result, a few East Coast racehorses who had only raced on natural dirt surfaces did not ship to Santa Anita for the Breeders' Cup. Most notably, the connections of the outstanding filly Rachel Alexandra announced that she would not race on \"plastic\".\nInstead, the favorite for the race was Zenyatta, who in 2008 had won the Ladies Classic and was named the Champion Older Female Horse. Zenyatta came into the Classic undefeated in thirteen career starts and was, with Rachel Alexandra, one of the most popular horses in recent memory. However, some handicappers questioned her credentials. As a California-based horse, she had demonstrated her ability to win on synthetic but was viewed as having faced inferior competition to that on the East Coast. She also had never raced against male horses, had never run at miles, and the Beyer Speed Figures that she had recorded in previous races were unexceptional for a Grade I winner.\nShe was part of a thirteen horse field that included eight other Grade I/Group One winners from three countries. The most highly regarded contenders were:\nRace Description.\nIn post position four, Zenyatta was initially reluctant to enter the starting gate. Then Quality Road in post position twelve started acting up, delaying the start of the race by five minutes when he refused to load even after being blindfolded. When he injured himself kicking the gate, he was scratched. The rest of the field was unloaded due to the delay and then reloaded.\nWhen the race finally began, Zenyatta broke poorly and got off on the wrong lead. As was her custom, she dropped to the back of the field and trailed by as much as fifteen lengths. Down the backstretch, she had passed only one horse and was still about a dozen lengths behind. She started her move around the final turn, with jockey Mike Smith keeping her close to the rail to save ground. Track announcer Trevor Denman had kept an eye on the mare throughout the race, noting she had a lot of work to do at the top of the stretch, and saying \"If she wins this, she'll be a superhorse!\"\nTurning into the stretch, Zenyatta faced a wall of horses in front of her, so Smith angled her away from the rail. When she finally had running room in mid-stretch, she was still in sixth place but closed ground rapidly. As she moved to the lead, announcer Trevor Denman exclaimed, \"Zenyatta is flying on the grandstand side! This. Is. Un-be-liev-ABLE! What a performance! We will never see another like this!\"[52][53][54]\nZenyatta eventually won by a length. Gio Ponti, who had received an excellent trip on the rail, finished second while Twice Over was third.\nAfter moderate opening fractions, the time for the race was a solid 2:00.62. Nearly seven lengths behind with a quarter-mile remaining, Zenyatta ran the final quarter-mile in 23 seconds flat. It was the first time that a female horse had \"beat the boys\" in the Classic. Zenyatta was given a hero's welcome on her return to the winner's circle, with many fans holding signs honoring 'Queen Z.'\nAfter the race, Smith described the run. \"I had to hit her out of the stall,\" he said. \"Then she was on her left lead and you want to be on your right down the straight. Then she gathered herself up... At the half-mile (pole), they were stacked up... but then it was like the parting of the sea as it opened up down there. She won it well within herself, believe it or not.\" He also said, \"I believe if there was another horse ahead of Gio Ponti, she would have caught him, too. She still had run left.\"[50] \"She is all heart,\" said trainer John Shirreffs. \"The way the crowd took to her was just amazing. They cheered for her, they clapped for her. They love her. What a wonderful relationship.\"\nEven veteran horsemen were moved by Zenyatta's performance and the crowd's reaction. \"I switched camps at the eighth pole,\" said Bob Baffert, the trainer of Richard's Kid. \"When I saw my horse wasn't going to win, I started yelling for Zenyatta... I have never seen a grandstand like that; nobody wanted to leave. The crowd was captivated. It felt like a horse had just won the Triple Crown.\" \"She's a freak, what can I say?\" said Gio Ponti's trainer Christophe Clement. \"My horse ran a great race but he couldn't beat her.\"\nThe race was named the NTRA Moment of the Year.\nResults.\nQuality Road was scratched\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:24.16; – 0:47.88; – 1:11.88; mile – 1:36.16; final – 2:00.62&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:24.16) (:23.72) (:24.00) (:24.28) (:24.46)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "text": "The Argentina national basketball team represents Argentina in basketball international competitions, and is controlled by the Argentine Basketball Federation. (). The national team was formed in 1921, playing its first game v. Uruguay that same year.\nArgentina's national basketball team remains among the most successful in the Americas. It is the only national team in the FIBA Americas zone that has won the quintuplet crown: FIBA World Cup (they won the first edition, in 1950), Olympic Gold Medal (2004) (the highest honor and most important title of Argentina in the history of Argentina Basketball Men's Senior National Team), FIBA Diamond Ball (2008), FIBA AmeriCup (2001 and 2011) and Pan American Gold Medal (1995 and 2019). They have also won 13 South American Basketball Championships, as well as many youth championships.\nThe Argentine representative was also the first to defeat a United States national team with a full squad of NBA players. They did so by 87–80 in the 2002 FIBA World Championship held in Indianapolis.\n1910s and 1920s.\nThe practice of basketball in Argentina was started by \"Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (Young Men's Christian Association – YMCA)\" in 1912. Canadian Professor Paul Phillip was in charge to teach basketball at the YMCA headquarters in Paseo Colón Avenue, Buenos Aires.\nThe first basketball clubs in Argentina were YMCA, Hindú and Independiente. By 1912 the first basketball games were held by YMCA headquarters in Buenos Aires. In 1913 the first games between Argentine and Uruguayan YMCA are played. One year later, the YMCA organised the first internal championship. In 1919 the Uruguay national team played a game v. local team Nacional, in Buenos Aires.\nIn 1921 the \"Argentine Basketball Federation\" (original name: \"Federación Argentina de Basket-Ball\" – FABB) was established to organise competitions not only in Buenos Aires but in several cities around Argentina, such as Bahía Blanca and Córdoba where basketball would develop significantly in successive years. Argentina played its first international game (representing the FABB) against Uruguay in 1921. The players chosen to play that match were: S.G. Romero, J.C. Rodríguez Quiroga (captain), A. Birba, M. Hernandorena, J. Barbier.\nIn successive years, other clubs such as Ñaró, Estudiantes (LP), River Plate, Gimnasia y Esgrima, Universitario and Racing) registered their teams to the Federation. On August 30, 1929, the Argentine Basketball Federation (current \"Confederación Argentina\") was established, with founder members from Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fe, La Rioja, North Federation and Bahía Blanca. The Federación Argentina focused on the spread of basketball in Buenos Aires as in the rest of the provinces of Argentina.\n1930s and 1940s.\nBy the 1930s the practise of basketball had been widely spread around Buenos Aires, with the media (more remarkably \"El Gráfico\" magazine) not only covering the sport but even organising competitions.\nIn 1930 the first South American Championship (\"Campeonato Sudamericano\" in Spanish) was organised, being Argentina runner-up. The national side would win its first official title at the 3rd edition of the tournament, in 1934 in Buenos Aires. The national team finished winning all the games (6 in total) achieving the gold medal. Argentina won its second consecutive title at the 1935 Championship held in Rio de Janeiro with 3 wins and 1 loss.\nAfter several competitions with no wins, Argentina achieved a new title in 1941, winning all the games (5). During the successive editions, Argentina would achieve its first treble after winning the 1942 and 1943 championships. Nevertheless, Argentina would not win a new South American title until 1966.\n1950s.\nAfter the 1948 Olympic Tournament, FIBA decided to create a World Championship, and named Argentina as the host country for the inaugural 1950 edition. The team's coaching staff was formed by Jorge Canavesi as head coach, Casimiro González Trilla as his assistant and Jorge Boreau as the physical trainer. The squad, formed entirely by amateur players, trained in preparation for the tournament in River Plate's facilities every day in double shifts, something uncommon for the times. The Argentine government negotiated with the players' employers and studying centers to secure their times.\nThe team played around Oscar Furlong, a center with good mobility and passing skills. Other important players were Ricardo González (captain), Leopoldo Contarbio, Juan Carlos Uder, Raúl Pérez Varela and Roberto Viau (who was 18 years old at the time of the tournament). In the tournament itself, Argentina defeated France (56–40) in the preliminary round, followed by Brazil (40–35), Chile (62–41), France again (66–41) and EuroBasket champions Egypt (68–33) in the final round; before defeating the United States in the decisive match (64–50).\nAfter the World Championship title, Argentina won the silver medal at the 1951 Pan American Games held in Buenos Aires and finished fourth at the 1952 Summer Olympics held in Helsinki. However, for political reasons, the country did not participate in the 1953 South American Basketball Championship, nor did they defend the World Championship title in the 1954 edition of the tournament. The last participation of the 1950s generation was in the 1955 Pan American Games held in Mexico City, where they won another silver medal.\nThe world championship won clean and brilliantly, but, on January 8, 1957, the military dictatorship of Pedro Aramburu, who had taken power in Argentina via a coup d'état which called itself \"Revolución Libertadora\", provisionally suspended the 1950 World Championship winners; a measure that was later made permanent on March 27 of that year.\nAccording to the polemic amateur article a professional sportsman can not receive money, but the Argentinean players -not USA- received economic compensation for play. The suspension was for allegedly violating the Amateur Sportsman Statute, as, according to the administrators who had been installed in the Argentine Basketball Federation, the players had been paid to play by the overthrown government of Juan Perón. With a young and inexperienced team, Argentina finished fourth in the 1958 South American Basketball Championship and 10th (over 13 teams) in the 1959 FIBA World Championship.\n1960s.\nSubsequently, the team had further disappointing third and fourth-place finishes at the 1961 and 1963 South American Championships respectively, and did not participate in the 1963 Pan American Games.\nIn preparation for the 1963 World Championship, Alberto Andrizzi was appointed as head coach. For different reasons, point guards Ricardo Crespi and Hugo Olariaga, shooting guards Marcelo Farías and Norberto Batillana, centers Miguel Ballicora and Guillermo Riofrío, as well as Ricardo Alix, decided not to be part of the World Championship squad. Most of the players were amateurs, who alternated the practice of the sport with their jobs and studies.\nCoach Andrizzi formed a squad that averaged 22.8 years of age, the lowest in the team's history at the competition, and with only one player from the previous World Championship (Antonio Tozzi). This was also the first time Argentina took a player above the of stature to a World Championship, Zoilo Domínguez (who was ). The squad trained 8 days in Villa Allende, Córdoba Province, and played some preparation games against teams from Córdoba and Santa Fe. The delegation that traveled to Brazil (where the competition took place) had no assistant coach, nor a physician.\nIn the tournament itself, Argentina faced a tough group with Italy, the United States and Mexico. The team lost by a large margin their two initial games: 73–91 against Italy (that, contrary to Argentina, had a full team of professional players) and 51–81 against the United States (that had a team of university players, among them Willis Reed and Don Kojis). In the game against Mexico (that had Manuel Raga and Carlos Quintanar in their team), the 35 points scored by Alberto Desimone were not enough to avoid an 82–84 defeat. Desimone's feat of 35 points in one game were an Argentine record in the competition until Luis Scola scored 37 against Brazil in the 2010 World Championship. The team was eliminated in the preliminary round, but finished first in the \"consolation round\", played by the 6 teams eliminated in the first group stage.\nAfter the tournament, both of the teams centers received offers to continue their playing careers abroad. Desimone joined Pallacanestro Cantù in the Serie A of Italy and Zoilo Domínguez the St. Joseph College in the NCAA Division II of the United States. None of them ever played again for their national team.\nAfter the 1963 World Championship, the Argentine national team disbanded for 2 years and 8 months. In 1966, under Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata's coach Miguel Ángel Ripullone's guidance, Argentina finished second (behind the USA) in the Torneo de la Confraternidad Americana held in Cosquín. Subsequently, in that same year, the team finished last (among 13) in the Extra World Championship held in Chile. These two tournaments were the first international experiences for Ernesto Gehrmann and Alberto Cabrera, who went on to play many years for Argentina.\nFor the 1966 South American Basketball Championship to be held in Mendoza, and contrary to recent experiences, Argentina did a serious pre-tournament training. Alberto López (coach of River Plate and one of the 1950 World Champions) was selected as head coach, and joined by a coaching staff of two physical trainers, a physician and a kinesiologist. The squad for the tournament had a striking average height for the time, with Gehrmann (), brothers Miguel () and Tomás () Sandor, Miguel Ballicora (), Dante Massolini] () and Samuel Oliva (). Moreover, Ricardo Alix also took part of the team, after having declined for previous tournaments. With a good team and a good preparation, Argentina won the tournament back-to-back, defeating World Champions Brazil in the process, and breaking a 23-years run without winning a South American championship. That Argentine national team came to be nicknamed \"Los Cóndores\" (in English: \"the Condors\").\nFor the 1967 World Championship held in Uruguay, Miguel Ángel Ripullone returned as head coach, replacing Alberto López. The squad had five players from the previous South American Championship (Gehrmann, Tomás Sandor, Samuel Oliva, Carlos Mariani and Masolini) and three with World Championship experience (the aforementioned Oliva, Atilio Fruet and Héctor Barreneche). However, the players from the European leagues did not take part of the team. These included Carlos Ferello of Victoria Libertas Pesaro and Guillermo Riofrío, Alberto Desimone and Carlos D'Aquila of Pallacanestro Cantù (the latter two would go on to win the Serie A with the team in the 1967–68 season).\nIn the group stage, Argentina defeated Japan and Peru (who had beaten them in the last two South American Championships), and lost heavily against the Soviet Union by 39 points. In the final round, Argentina defeated only Uruguay, losing the other 5 games (United States, Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Poland). Ernesto Gehrmann's 18 points against the USA earned him an offer by CB Estudiantes, though he rejected it to sign for Palmeiras in Brazil. Argentina finished the competition 6th, the best position for the team until the 2002 Championship.\nAfter the tournament, the debate in Argentine basketball became about the importance of having tall players.\nTwo months after the 1967 World Championship, Argentina, lead again by coach Casimiro González Trilla who had replaced Alberto López, took a team with 5 centers and only two guards to the Pan American Games held in Winnipeg (the team finished 6th of 10). In times were the lack of high stature players was a big problem for the national team, 3 players that could have solved the problem either declined to play for the national team, or abandoned basketball altogether: Alberto Desimone never returned to the national team despite his success in Italy, Zoilo Domínguez ended his basketball career, and Tomás Sandor after training more than a month with the NBA's Washington Bullets took a job as an engineer in San Francisco, ending his basketball career. Moreover, Guillermo Riofrío often declined citations.\nIn 1968, Argentina finished 5th in the South American Championship (equaling its worst position in the history of the tournament). Moreover, the team did not qualify for the 1970 World Championship, after a third-place finish in the 1969 South American Championship. This was the first time the Argentine national team did not take part of the competition since its inception in 1950. In 1973, Argentina played the final of the South American Championship after seven years without doing so, losing to Brazil (but qualifying for the World Championship). Between the 1967 World Championship and the 1973 South American Championship, the team had 4 coaches: Casimiro González Trilla, Jorge Canavesi, Jorge Martínez and Miguel Ángel Ripullone. The latter was confirmed as head coach for the 1974 FIBA World Championship to be held in Puerto Rico.\n1970s.\nTo compensate for the lack of international experience of most of the players, the national team made the longest tour in its history, playing 20 games in 46 days throughout Europe. Argentina faced some of the strongest teams in the world, like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Italy; returning with 6 victories (West Germany (2), Switzerland (2), Greece and Italy). After the tour, José de Lizaso and Carlos Pellandini were cut from the squad, due to an argument with the coach the former and due to injury the latter.\nThe team for the 1974 World Championship was built around four experienced players: Alberto Cabrera, Ernesto Gehrmann, Carlos González and Alfredo Monachesi (who averaged 28 years of age) the intermediate generation of Adolfo Perazzo, Jorge Becerra and Raúl Guitart (averaging 23), and the youngsters Eduardo Cadillac and Carlos Raffaeli (who had won the South American Youth Championships of 1972 and 1973). Though some of the players had other jobs or studied, all of them were professional, exception being Cabrera who did not get paid in Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca for a matter of personal principle.\nIn the tournament itself, Argentina was faced in a tough group with the United States, Spain (1973 EuroBasket runners-up) and the Philippines. The key match for Argentina to advance was the debut against Spain. With Cabrera defending the Spaniard's key player Wayne Brabender, the team finished the first half 47–44 above, with Barbender only scoring two points. However, by the fifth minute of the second half Cabrera reached his fourth personal foul, and Barbender had more freedom to reach a total 22 points. The 23 turnovers and weak defense were key for Argentina's final 89–96 defeat. In the second game against the Philippines, Gehrmann's 31 points and 12 rebounds lead to a 110–90 victory, though the turnovers (20) and defense were an unsolved problem. The national team then lost to the US 86–109 to finally be eliminated. In the consolation round, Argentina finished third. The 121–70 victory over the Central African Republic (the team's highest scoring record in the history of the competition) was the only victory, as they suffered defeats against Australia, Mexico (a game in which Cabrera reached his fifth foul by the 12th minute of the first half) and Czechoslovakia (who had 45 points scored by Kamil Brabenec). The national team finished the World Championship in the 11th place.\nAfter the 1974 Championship, the team won two South American Championships: 1976 (at home in Bahía Blanca) and 1979 (in Medellin, Colombia). However, they failed to qualify for the World Cups of 1978 and 1982, due to finishing third in the qualifying tournaments of 1977 (without Perazzo, Raffaelli and Prato in the squad) and 1981 (same situation, but this time also without Cadillac, injured).\n1980s.\nIn 1980, coached by Ripullone and with the assistance of Yugoslavian Ranko Zeravica, the team finished third in the Tournament of the Americas, earning their first qualification for the Olympics since 1952. This was arguably the biggest achievement for Argentine basketball since the 1950 World Championship title. However, due to the country's adherence to the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics, the team did not compete in the tournament. The decade continued with a second place in the 1983 South American Basketball Championship (with Alberto Finguer as coach) and a disappointing 7th place (among nine teams) in the 1984 Tournament of the Americas held in Brazil.\nDespite the poor international performance, 1984 came to be one of the most important years in the history of Argentine basketball, as it was the debut season of the Liga Nacional de Básquet (LNB), the first professional nationwide basketball league of the country.\nFor the 1985 South American Championship, León Najnudel, the mastermind behind the LNB's inception, was selected as the national coach. With him came a renovation in the national squad, with the youngsters Héctor Campana (20 years old), Hernán Montenegro (18), Sergio Aispurúa (20) and the two tallest Argentine players in history: Jorge González (19 and ) and Fernando Borcel (17 and ). Argentina finished the tournament third, enough to qualify for the 1986 FIBA World Championship to be held in Spain. However, Najnudel did not coach the team during the World Cup, having left the position due to a fight with CABB's president Amadeo Cejas.\nPuerto Rican Flor Meléndez, by the time coach of Unión de Santa Fe in Argentina, was selected to manage the national team. The coach made up a squad with experienced players like Miguel Cortijo, Esteban Camisassa, Carlos Romano, Luis González, Luis Oroño and Gabriel Milovich, and youngsters like Campana, Sebastián Uranga, Diego Maggi, Marcelo Milanesio, Montenegro and Aispurúa. To get the necessary international experience, the team played a total 19 preparation matches in one month, though during the first games Meléndez' assistant Juan Carlos Alonso took up coaching duties while the former coached his team in the Puerto Rican league's playoff matches. During the preparation, González suffered an injury and had to be replaced by Borcel for the World Championship squad.\nFor the first round of the 1986 World Championship, Argentina was part of Group D with Yugoslavia, Canada, the Netherlands, Malaysia and New Zealand. The key match for obtaining qualification was the debut against the Netherlands, in which the youngster Rik Smits (19 years of age and ) scored 25 points. However, Argentina won in extra time 82–75, with good contributions from the substitutes Campana (13 points) and Uranga (16). There were no surprises in the other 4 games: Argentina lost to Canada (82–96) and Yugoslavia (68–87) and defeated both Malaysia (93–73) and New Zealand (89–64), effectively qualifying for the second round of the tournament.\nThe national team faced a tough second round debut against the United States, that had a team made up by university players, 11 of whom went on to play in the NBA. However, Argentina achieved a surprising 74–70 victory, arguably the most important in the team's history until the Golden Generation era (starting roughly in 2002). After a 97–80 victory over China, the team had serious possibilities of qualifying to the semifinals, but Yugoslavia's defeat by the US crushed that chance. Subsequently, a 70–78 defeat by Italy forced Argentina to play for the 9th to 12th place. Further defeats against Greece (88–102, suffering 40 points by Nicos Gallis) and Cuba (85–81) derived in a 12th-place finish.\nAfter the 1986 World Championship, Flor Meléndez took the team to win the gold medal in the 1987 South American Championship held in Asunción (Paraguay). It was the first title for Argentina since 1979. After that victory and a poor participation in the 1987 Panamerican Games, Meléndez left his coaching position and was replaced by Alberto Finguer. With the new coach, Argentina finished 8th (among 10 teams) in the 1989 FIBA Americas Championship. Nonetheless, the team qualified directly for the 1990 FIBA World Championship as the host nation.\n1990s.\nRiver Plate's coach Carlos Boismené was selected to replace Finguer in 1990, with Guillermo Vecchio as his assistant. However, coach and assistant had a fight, leading to Vecchio's departure. Boismené rejected the possibility of having a replacement, even when Serbian Ranko Zeravica was offered. The coach also faced problems when forming the squad, due to Germán Filloy and Esteban Camisassa's injuries, and center Carlos Cerutti's death earlier that year. Hernán Montenegro was also cut alleging his problematic attitude. Moreover, in a pre-tournament friendly against Greece, Héctor Campana, the team's key offensive player, suffered an injury.\nIn the debut, with Campana playing injured, Argentina lost by 20 to the Soviet Union. The second game, decisive for qualification to the second round, was against Canada. With 4 minutes to go, Argentina was down 72–85. However, a 24–3 run gave the hosts the victory, which meant qualification to the second round after the third match-day victory over Egypt. In the second round, the team debuted against the United States in the Luna Park stadium. 33 points by Campana and a solid teamwork were not enough to avoid defeat, the same result suffered in the next four games: Puerto Rico, Greece and Australia (twice). Argentina finished the tournament 8th.\nAfter the 1990 tournament, the head coaching job was held by Guillermo Vecchio for the four-years process prior to the 1994 World Championship. With a bronze medal at the 1993 FIBA Americas Championship, Argentina qualified to the competition to be held in Canada.\nThe squad for tournament was formed by the best players from the local league (exception being Montenegro, who rejected the call up) plus Marcelo Nicola, who was playing for Tau Cerámica in Spain. With a taller team (including Rubén Wolkowyski, Diego Osella, Osvaldo Tourn, Esteban Pérez and the aforementioned Nicola) and two high scoring shooting guards (Héctor Campana and Juan Espil).\nCoached by Guillermo Vecchio, Argentina won first ever gold medal in senior men's Panamerican basketball, at the 1995 Pan American Games, after defeating the United States in the final, in Mar del Plata, Argentina. The team was composed by players as Marcelo Milanesio, Diego Osella, Ruben Wolkowisky, Estaban De la Fuente, Juan Espil, and a young Fabricio Oberto among others.\n2000–2014: the \"Golden Generation\".\nAfter obtaining back-to-back gold medals in the 2001 South American championship and in the 2001 Tournament of the Americas, Argentina took the first step on a path to solidify their place in basketball elite. Next came the 2002 FIBA World Championship celebrated in Indianapolis, where they made history by being the first team to defeat a United States roster composed entirely of NBA players. Argentina would reach the finals for the first time since the first World Championship in 1950, but would lose to Yugoslavia. The following year, after obtaining a sixth place in the 2003 Pan American Games with an alternate roster, Argentina sent their best players to San Juan, Puerto Rico for the 2003 Tournament of the Americas that would grant three spots in the 2004 Summer Olympics. After a starting the tournament with a defeat against Mexico, Argentina would reach the finals and lose against the United States, securing a spot in the Olympics anyway.\nIn July 2004 Argentina began preparations for the Olympic Games in Athens, starting with the 2004 South American Championship held in Brazil, the Argentine team defeated the hosts in the final. Next came a series of exhibitions on home soil against Venezuela, Spain's alternate team and Brazil, on which Argentina came away with no victories. With the final roster decided, Argentina traveled to Europe for a last series of matches. From July 31 to August 3, the second edition of the FIBA Diamond Ball was held in Belgrade, a tournament that reunited the champions from the five FIBA zones, plus the reigning World Champion. Argentina participated as the Americas representative, since the United States did not participate and finished in third place. Argentina then concluded its series of exhibitions in Madrid with a victory against Lithuania and a defeat against the locals Spain.\nArgentina made their debut on the group phase of the Olympic Tournament with an 83–82 victory against world champions Serbia and Montenegro, thanks to a last-second basket by Manu Ginóbili. After losses against Spain and Italy, Argentina still managed to advance to the next stage. In the quarterfinals, the Argentine team beat hosts Greece and advanced to the semifinals where they achieved yet another historic victory against the United States, denying the American men's team a gold medal for the first time since 1988 in Seoul – the last Olympic tournament before the advent of the Dream Team. On August 28, 2004, Argentina obtained its first gold medal in basketball by defeating Italy 84–69 in the final. The impact the series of results obtained between the Indianapolis and Athens tournaments led the Argentine press to dub this group of players \"The Golden Generation\" (\"La Generación Dorada\", in Spanish). The Olympics title in 2004 is the higher honor and important title of Argentine basketball.\nAfter those triumphs, Argentina won the gold medal in 2008 FIBA Diamond Ball, and the bronze medal at The 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament. At the end of the 2008 Olympic Games Argentina reached the first position in the FIBA Men's Ranking.\nIn 2010, after the World Cup, Julio Lamas returned as coach of the national team.

After that match the media stated it was the end of the \"Golden Generation\" with some of Argentina's key players (Pablo Prigioni, Leonardo Gutiérrez and Andrés Nocioni) retiring from the national team.\n2015-present.\nIn January 2015, Sergio Hernández was appointed coach of Argentina. With Hernández on the bench, the squad qualified to play the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro after winning the silver medal in the 2015 FIBA Americas Championship. With Scola (named MVP of the tournament) and Nocioni as the remaining key players from the \"Golden Generation\" and the addition of young players such as Facundo Campazzo, Nicolás Laprovittola, Nicolás Richotti, Patricio Garino, Nicolás Brussino, Gabriel Deck, Marcos Delía and Tayavek Gallizi, the team reached the final, losing to Venezuela by 76–71.\nManu Ginóbili and Carlos Delfino returned to the team for the Olympics after their injuries. Argentina finished 4th at Group B with three wins (against Nigeria, Croatia and Brazil and two losses (to Lithuania and Spain). In quarter finals, Argentina was defeated by United States (105–78), being therefore eliminated from the competition. After that match, Ginóbili y and Nocioni announced their retirement from the national team.\nAfter the game, USA's coach, Mike Krzyzewski, praised the Argentine players defining them as \"not only a team but a culture, because of the magnificence they have been showing to the world during the last two decades\".\nIn 2019, led by Luis Scola and Facundo Campazzo at the pitch, and with Sergio Hernández as coach, the Argentine team won the gold medal in the Panamerican Games, beating Puerto Rico in the final match. It was the second gold medal at Panamerican Games for Argentina. The last one had been in 1995.\nIn 2022, with Gabriel Deck and Facundo Campazzo standing out at the pitch (they were named in the All-Tournament Team), and with Pablo Prigioni as coach, the Argentine team won the gold medal in the 2022 FIBA Americup, beating the hosts Brazil in the final match. It was the third gold medal in the FIBA Americup for Argentina. The last one had been in 2011, in Mar Del Plata."

He was also one of only two people to have been captain, secretary and president of Leicester Tigers.\nBarr made his Leicester debut on 3 November 1928 against Cambridge University as Tigers lost 20–3. He featured a further 10 times that season but featured only once the following season as he struggled to break into the team. Returning to the line up on 29 January 1931 he featured in 13 of the last 16 games of the 1930–31 season.\nBarr played fullback in Leicestershire and the East Midlands victory over the touring South Africans the Springbokson 14 November 1931, the only defeat the side suffered on their tour. That performance earned him an England Test debut against the same opposition on 2 January 1932 at Twickenham. He also played two weeks later against Wales at St. Helen's in Swansea. England lost both but Barr was retained for a third and final cap against at Lansdowne Road which England won 11–8.\nBarr became Leicester's regular stand in captain during 1935, deputising when Bernard Gadney was unavailable, and captained Tigers for the 1936–37 and 1937–38 seasons. He never scored a try for Leicester in 241 games, a record for games without a try.\nDuring the Second World War he was a Territorial Officer in the Leicestershire searchlights unit and was captured at Boulogne. He spent five years as a prisoner of war and when he was repatriated was awarded the Military Cross. After the war he was a vital part of reconstructing Leicester Tigers; taking the role of team secretary (arranging the fixtures) and in 1957 becoming secretary of the club. In 1962 he was elected president for a two-year term."

        "text": "The 2017 ICC Women's World Cup Final was a women's One Day International cricket match played between England and India to decide the winner of the 2017 Women's World Cup. England won the game by nine runs to secure their fourth World Cup title, with Anya Shrubsole named player of the match. It was one of the closest finals in tournament history, with only the 2000 final being decided by a narrower margin.\nThe final was played at Lord's, London, on 23 July 2017. Lord's had been announced as the host on 8 February 2016. The game was sold out, with a near-capacity crowd of around 24,000 in attendance. The bell to signal the start of play was rung by Eileen Ash, who at 105 years old is the oldest surviving international cricketer.\nBackground.\nSignificance.\nEngland were playing in the Women's World Cup Final for the fifth time, a mark surpassed only by Australia. However, in the preceding five tournaments (1997–2013), England had made the final just once, defeating New Zealand in the 2009 final to claim their third World Cup title. India on the other hand was playing in the World Cup Final for only the second time in their history. The first had been a loss to Australia in 2005.\nRoute to the final.\nThe group stage of the 2017 World Cup consisted of a simple round-robin, with each of the eight teams playing each other once and the top four teams progressing to the semi-finals. In the opening match of the tournament, India unexpectedly defeated England by 35 runs. However, England went on to win all six of their remaining group-stage games, finishing top of the table – with the same number of points as Australia but a superior net run rate. India finished third in the group stage, after losses to South Africa (by 115 runs) and Australia (by eight wickets).\nIn the first semi-final, played on 18 July at Bristol County Ground, England defeated South Africa by two wickets. South Africa batted first, posting a score of 218/6 from their 50 overs. Towards the end of their innings, England required three runs from the final over to win, with Anya Shrubsole hitting the winning runs off Shabnim Ismail with just two balls to spare.\nThe second semi-final, played at The County Ground, Derby, was reduced to 42 overs per side due to rain. India posted a score of 281/4, with Harmanpreet Kaur scoring 171 (not out) from 115 balls, including seven sixes. This was the highest individual score in the knockout stages of a World Cup, and was widely heralded as one of the greatest ever World Cup innings. In response, Australia was bowled out for 245, leaving India the victors by 36 runs.\nTeams.\nEach team had 15 players in its tournament squad, 11 of whom played in the final. Both teams selected the same line-up for the final as they used in their semi-finals. Only five selected players had previously played in a World Cup final – Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami for India, and Katherine Brunt, Laura Marsh, and Sarah Taylor for England.\nMatch.\nEngland innings.\nEngland's captain Heather Knight won the toss and elected to bat. Their openers, Lauren Winfield (24 runs) and Tammy Beaumont (23), made steady progress, putting on 47 runs before Winfield was bowled by Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Beaumont was out three overs later, caught in the deep off the bowling of Poonam Yadav. This brought Heather Knight (1) to the crease, but she lasted just seven balls before also being dismissed by Yadav, leg before wicket (lbw; via DRS). Sarah Taylor (45) and Natalie Sciver (51) steadied the ship somewhat, putting on 83 runs for the fourth wicket whilst light rain fell. With the score at 146, Taylor was caught behind from the bowling of Jhulan Goswami. Goswami then had Fran Wilson out next ball, for a golden duck. Sciver also fell to Goswami a few overs later, unsuccessfully challenging an lbw decision. Katherine Brunt (34) and Jenny Gunn (25 not out) put on 32 runs for the seventh wicket before Brunt was run out by Goswami with a direct hit. Gunn continued on with Laura Marsh (14 not out) for the last four overs, with England finishing on 228/7 from their 50 overs. Jhulan Goswami was the pick of the Indian bowlers, finished with 3/23.\nIndia innings.\nIndia lost a wicket in their second over, with Smriti Mandhana bowled by Anya Shrubsole for a duck. Punam Raut (86 runs) and Mithali Raj (17) then put on 38 runs before Raj was run out by Natalie Sciver. Raut and Harmanpreet Kaur (51) compiled a 95-run fourth-wicket partnership, lasting just over 20 overs, before Kaur was caught in the deep off the bowling of Alex Hartley. Raut then combined with Veda Krishnamurthy (35) for an additional 53 runs. Shrubsole then dismissed Raut lbw with India at 191 and led a batting collapse, with India losing their final seven wickets for just 28 runs. Hartley bowled Sushma Verma for a duck and Shrubsole claimed the wickets of Krishnamurthy and Jhulan Goswami before Shikha Pandey was run out. As the match reached its climax, India required 11 runs from the last two overs, but they could only add one more run before Shrubsole finished the job by dismissing both Deepti Sharma and Rajeshwari Gayakwad in four balls. Shrubsole – the player of the match – finished with 6/46 from 9.4 overs, the best bowling figures in any World Cup final."

        "text": "The 2018 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2018 Betfred World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament held from 21 April to 7 May 2018 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. Hosted by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, it was the 20th and final ranking event of the 2017–18 snooker season and the 42nd consecutive time the World Snooker Championship had been held at the venue. The tournament was broadcast by BBC Sport and Eurosport in Europe, and sponsored by betting company Betfred.\nWelsh left-hander Mark Williams won his third world championship and 21st ranking title, defeating Scottish professional John Higgins 18–16 in the final. Williams' victory came 15 years after his second world title in 2003; before the start of the season, he had not won a ranking event in the previous six years. In winning the event, Williams received the highest prize money awarded for a snooker event, £425,000 of a total pool of £1,968,000. Aged 43, he was the third oldest winner at the crucible after Ronnie O'Sullivan who was 44 when he won the 2020 World Snooker Championship and Ray Reardon who was 45 when he won the title in 1978. Defending and three-time world champion Mark Selby had won the world title for the previous two years, but lost in the first round 4–10 to Joe Perry.\nThe highest of the championship was scored by Higgins, who made a break of 146 in frame 13 of his second round win over Jack Lisowski. However, in qualifying for the event, Liang Wenbo scored a maximum break of 147.\nBackground.\nThe World Snooker Championship is an annual cue sport tournament and is the official world championship of the game of snooker. Snooker was founded in the late 19th century by British Army soldiers stationed in India. The sport originated by players from the United Kingdom, and later players from Europe and the Commonwealth. In more modern times, the sport has transferred to being played worldwide, specifically in Asia, such as in China, Thailand and Hong Kong. The world championship was the final event of the 2017/18 snooker calendar, with the winner of the event being crowned as the professional world champion of the sport.\nThe world championship sees 32 professional players compete in one-on-one snooker matches in a single elimination format, each played over several . The 32 players for the event are selected through a mix of the world snooker rankings and a pre-tournament qualification round. The first world championship in 1927, held in Camkin's Hall, Birmingham, England, was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977, the event has been held in the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield.\n, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. The previous year's championship had been won by England's Mark Selby, who won the event defeating Scotland's John Higgins in the final 18–15. This was Selby's third championship, having won previously in 2014 and 2016. The champion of the 2018 event would win prize money of £425,000, from a total pool of £1,968,000.\nFormat.\nThe 2018 World Snooker Championship was held between 21 April and 7 May 2018 in Sheffield, England. The tournament was the last of twenty rankings events in the 2017/2018 season on the World Snooker Tour. It featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Crucible Theatre, as well as a 128-player qualifying draw which took place at the English Institute of Sport from 11 to 18 April 2018, finishing three days prior to the start of the main draw. This was the 42nd consecutive year the tournament was held at the Crucible, and the 50th consecutive year the championship was contested through the modern knockout format.\nThe top 16 players in the latest world rankings automatically qualified for the main draw as seeded players. Defending champion Mark Selby was automatically seeded 1st overall. The remaining fifteen seeds were allocated based on the latest world rankings (revision 10), which were released following the China Open, the penultimate event of the season. With Selby ranked as the world number 1 entering the event, every player's seed therefore corresponded to their respective world ranking. Matches in the first round of the main draw were played as best of 19 frames. The number of frames needed to win a match increased with each successive round, leading up to the final match which was played as best of 35 frames.\nAll 16 non-seeded spots in the main draw were filled with players from the qualifying rounds. The qualifying draw consisted of 128 players, including 113 of the remaining 115 players on the World Snooker Tour, as well as fifteen wildcard places allotted to non-tour players. These invited players included the women's world champion, the European junior champion, and all four semi-finalists at the amateur championship. As with the main draw, half of the participants in the qualifying draw were seeded players. Every player ranked from 17th to 80th was allocated one of 64 seeds in order of their ranking, while all of the other participants were placed randomly into the draw. In order to reach the main draw at the Crucible, players needed to win three best of 19 frame matches.\nParticipant summary.\nEight former world champions participated in the main tournament: Ronnie O'Sullivan (five titles: 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2013), John Higgins (four titles: 1998, 2007, 2009, 2011), Mark Selby (three titles and two-time defending champion: 2014, 2016, 2017), Mark Williams (two titles: 2000 and 2003), Shaun Murphy (one title: 2005), Graeme Dott (one title: 2006), Neil Robertson (one title: 2010), and Stuart Bingham (one title: 2015). This was O'Sullivan's 26th consecutive appearance in the final stages of the World Championship since his debut in 1993, just one short of Stephen Hendry's record of 27 consecutive appearances and four short of Steve Davis's record of 30 total appearances. Five other former world championship finalists also competed: Matthew Stevens (twice: 2000 and 2005), Ali Carter (twice: 2008 and 2012), Judd Trump (once: 2011), Barry Hawkins (once: 2013), and Ding Junhui (once: 2016). The youngest player to participate in the main stage of the tournament was Lyu Haotian at 20 years of age, while 43-year-old Joe Perry was the oldest; both players entered the main draw through qualifying. Marco Fu made his return to competition at the World Championship, having missed much of the 2017/2018 season after undergoing surgery to repair retinal degeneration and myodesopsia in his left eye.\nThree former world champions participated in the qualifying rounds: Ken Doherty (1997), Peter Ebdon (2002) and Graeme Dott (2006). Of these, only Dott succeeded in qualifying for the main tournament at the Crucible. Also, three former world finalists participated in the qualifying rounds: Jimmy White (six times: 1984 and 1990–1994), Nigel Bond (once: 1995) and Matthew Stevens (twice: 2000 and 2005). Of these, only Stevens qualified for the main tournament at the Crucible. The youngest participant in qualifying was Jackson Page at 16 years of age, while 55-year-old Jimmy White was the oldest participant; however, neither player qualified.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2018 is shown below.\nThe prize for a in the main rounds was boosted to £40,000, whereas the prize for a 147 in qualifying was £10,000. The latter prize was claimed by Liang Wenbo during his first qualifying round match against Rod Lawler.\nSummary.\nQualifying rounds.\nThe qualifying rounds took place at the English Institute of Sport from 11 to 18 April 2018. In the first round of qualifying, Liang Wenbo achieved his third professional maximum break, and his second of the 2017/2018 season, in the 10th frame of his match against Rod Lawler. It was the second consecutive year a 147 was made in World Championship qualifying, and the fourth time overall. Liang came very close to becoming the first player to score two maximums in the same match, but he missed the final black after a break of 140 in the last frame. Liang was eliminated in the third round of qualifying; ranked at world number 19, he was the highest-ranked player not to feature in the main draw of the tournament, as both world number 17 Ryan Day and world number 18 Stephen Maguire qualified.\nOnly seven of the 64 unseeded participants in qualifying (players ranked outside the world's top 80) made it through the first qualifying round, and only one of those seven, Adam Duffy, progressed to the third qualifying round. Duffy did not, however, qualify for the main draw at the Crucible. Four players qualified for the Crucible for the first time: Lyu Haotian, Liam Highfield, Thepchaiya Un-Nooh, and Chris Wakelin. Lyu was the lowest ranked player to reach the main stage, at world number 68.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the opening round of the main tournament was conducted on 19 April 2018, two days before the start of the competition. Technical issues delayed the 10:00 BST start time by two hours, to 12:00. The matches for the first round were spread out over six days from 21 to 26 April, and played using a two table setup in the Crucible Theatre. Each first round match was played over two sessions, as best of 19 frames (10 frames needed to win). Players and spectators criticised the two-hour delay to the tournament's first-round draw, which was caused by \"technical issues\". World number 22 Joe Perry called the draw \"an absolute joke\", claiming the delay caused qualifiers to \"have no idea when [they] are playing, have to book hotels and make travel plans\".\nOf the sixteen first round matches, six ended with qualifiers defeating seeded players. The biggest upset of the round happened in the opening match, when Joe Perry defeated the defending champion and world number 1 Mark Selby. Perry won the first four frames before pulling away to 7–2 ahead after the first session of play. Selby was unable to catch Perry and was defeated 4–10, ending his 10-match undefeated streak in the world championships, as well as his two-year reign as world champion. The next highest ranked player to lose was world number 8 Shaun Murphy, who was upset by world number 51 Jamie Jones in a tight 10–9 match, where the scores were level at various stages.\nThe other four seeds to lose were the players ranked 10 through 13 in the world. Chinese debutant Lyu Haotian, both the youngest and lowest ranked player in the draw, defeated world number 11 Marco Fu in Fu's return to the Tour after eye surgery. Lyu was the only debutant to advance; he was 6–3 up after the first session and went on to win the match 10–5. Robert Milkins defeated world number 10 Neil Robertson 10–5. Jack Lisowski defeated world number 12 Stuart Bingham 10–7, thereby securing his first world championship match win in his second attempt. The 2015 world champion Bingham stated he was going to take a leave of absence from the sport after the loss. Bingham said he wanted to \"spend some time with the family and put my cue down for a while\". Bingham had spent three months of the season serving a ban for betting infringements; he commented, \"It's not been the best of seasons in general, but on the table I've been pretty good.\" Ricky Walden defeated world number 13 Luca Brecel 10–6; he was comfortably five frames ahead at 8–3, when Brecel won the next three frames to bring the score to 8–6, before Walden won the last two frames of the match.\nOf the eight former world champions playing in the main stage of the tournament, only three progressed to the second round: Ronnie O'Sullivan (five-time champion), John Higgins (four-time champion) and Mark Williams (two-time champion). All three were top seven seeds and had turned professional in the same year, 1992. Ronnie O'Sullivan trailed 0–4 and then 3–6 after the opening session in his match against Stephen Maguire but then won seven of the last eight frames to win 10–7. The 16th frame of this encounter was O'Sullivan's 1000th frame win at the Crucible. This was also his 15th consecutive first round victory at the world championships. John Higgins defeated Thai debutant Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 10–7. Both players attempted maximum breaks: Higgins missed the 14th red ball on 104 in the 8th frame of the first session; Un-Nooh scored 14 reds with blacks, on course for his second career maximum, before missing the 15th red on 112 in the 12th frame of the final session. Mark Williams defeated Jimmy Robertson in his first round match 10–5. Williams led 7–2 after the initial session, then he hit a tournament highest break (at that point) of 140 in the 13th frame, to go 9–4 ahead, before winning the match after two further frames.\nIn addition to O'Sullivan, Ali Carter and Anthony McGill both advanced despite trailing by three frames in the middle of their matches. Carter defeated Graeme Dott 10–8 in his first round match, despite being behind 3–6 overnight. McGill defeated Ryan Day 10–8; after trailing 5–8 earlier in the match, McGill won the last five frames to secure his place in the second round. He said he could not believe he had won, and the BBC referred to McGill's win as an \"unbelievable comeback\". The closing match of the first round saw the second final frame decider, after Jones's upset of Murphy. Recovering from 4–8 behind against Judd Trump, debutant Chris Wakelin won four frames in a row, to draw level at 8–8. The two players shared the next two frames, bringing the score to nine apiece, before Trump took the deciding frame.\nThe winners of the remaining matches of the round were Kyren Wilson, Mark Allen, Barry Hawkins, and Ding Junhui. Wilson defeated Matthew Stevens 10–3. In the 12th frame, Stevens accidentally nudged the pink ball with his hand and declared a foul on himself, which allowed Wilson to win the frame, extending his lead to 9–3. Allen, the reigning Masters champion, defeated debutant Liam Highfield 10–5; neither player scored a century, although Highfield came close with two breaks of 99. Hawkins defeated Stuart Carrington 10–7, after winning a 55-minute 14th frame. For the second successive year, Ding faced a fellow Chinese player in the first round of the tournament; having defeated Zhou Yuelong in 2017, he faced Xiao Guodong in 2018. Ding came out as a convincing 10–3 winner, despite losing the opening two frames of the match.\nSecond round.\nThe second round matches were played as best of 25 frames (13 frames needed to win), each over three sessions using a two table setup. The first match of the second round was between Mark Allen and Joe Perry, who defeated the defending champion in the first round. After sharing the first two sessions of their second round match at 8–8, Allen won all five frames in the third session to go through to the quarter-finals with a 13–8 win.\nBarry Hawkins defeated Lyu Haotian 13–10 in their second round match, to enter the quarter-finals for the sixth consecutive year. The pair were level at 10–10 before Hawkins won the last three frames of the match. Ali Carter played Ronnie O'Sullivan in the second round, a rematch of both the 2008 and the 2012 World Championship finals. The two players came into contact and exchanged words after the 19th frame of the match. The pair had brushed shoulders, in an incident the \"Independent\" described as a \"barge\". Following the match, O'Sullivan described it as being \"overplayed\" by the media. Having defeated O'Sullivan on only one occasion from a total of seventeen attempts in the group stages of the non-ranking 2010 Championship League, Carter eventually triumphed 13–9 to advance to the quarter-finals.\nKyren Wilson secured a place in the quarter-finals by defeating Jamie Jones 13–5, winning all of the last six frames of the match. During a clearance in the penultimate frame, Wilson played a screw shot which jumped the cueball off the table, damaging the head of his cue tip. John Higgins defeated Jack Lisowski 13–1, with a session to spare; Lisowski scored his only frame of the match at 0–10 behind. In the 13th frame, Higgins scored a break of 146, one point short of a maximum. This was Higgins' highest break at the Crucible (until 147 in the 2020 tournament), and it was the highest anyone scored in the 2018 tournament.\nThe remaining three matches of the second round finished with Ding Junhui defeating Anthony McGill 13–4, after having won the first session of their match 8–0 and scoring seven 50+ breaks. Judd Trump defeated Ricky Walden 13–9, taking a late lead after the score drew level at 8–8 following the first two sessions. Mark Williams defeated Robert Milkins, 13–7, thereby eliminating the only remaining qualifier in the competition.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were also played as best of 25 frames, each over three sessions using a two table setup, with the four matches played on 1 and 2 May 2018. All eight of the quarter-finalists were seeded players, with Mark Allen the lowest ranked player left in the competition at world number 16. Barry Hawkins defeated Ding Junhui 13–5, to make it through to his fifth Crucible semi-final in six years. Kyren Wilson played Mark Allen, in a repeat of the 2018 Masters final just over three months prior. Despite having lost to Allen in that match, Wilson took an 11–5 lead over Allen overnight, eventually winning the match 13–6. With this victory, Wilson made it through to his first ever Crucible semi-final, having lost in the quarter-finals in the previous two World Championships. Mark Williams took leads of 5–3 and 9–7 after the first two sessions against Ali Carter. Williams then won four of the last five frames, with four breaks of 100 or more, to defeat Carter 13–8.\nThe closest quarter-final was the last match, between John Higgins and Judd Trump, which was a rematch of the 2011 World Championship final. Trump gained an early lead in the second session at 7–3, but Higgins won the next five frames, and the pair finished the session at 8–8. Trump won the next two frames and took a two-frame lead at 11–9, before Higgins won the next three frames to retake the lead at 12–11. Trump won the 24th frame to force a final frame decider, which Higgins won to clinch the match, later describing it as a \"classic\" and joking that Trump \"must hate the sight of him\".\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were each played over four sessions, between 3 and 5 May 2018, with the matches played as best of 33 frames (17 frames needed to win) in a . The first semi-final was between John Higgins and Kyren Wilson. Higgins took an early lead in the opening session, leading Wilson 5–3, and retained this lead into the next two sessions, at 9–7, and 13–11. The pair shared the next four frames to leave the match at 15–13, before Higgins won the final two frames to win 17–13.\nThe second semi-final was between Barry Hawkins and Mark Williams. Hawkins took a similar lead over Williams, with Hawkins taking 5–3, 9–7, and 13–11 leads, before going into the final session. Williams made a comeback, drawing level at 14 frames apiece, and then again at 15 all. Williams took the lead for the first time in the match at 16–15, before winning it 17–15. His victory ensured that, for the first time since the World Championship moved to the Crucible in 1977, both finalists would be over 40 years old.\nFinal.\nThe two finalists were John Higgins and Mark Williams; both former champions. The final was played as a best of 35 frames match (18 frames needed to win), spread over four sessions between 6 and 7 May 2018. Williams took an early lead in the first session of the match, winning all of the first four frames. Higgins won the second mini-session 3–1, so the first session ended with a 5–3 lead for Williams. In the second session, Williams took the next two frames to lead 7–3, before Higgins scored four consecutive frames to level the score at 7–7. Williams then pulled away once again, winning the final three frames to take a 10–7 lead overnight.\nWilliams won the first four frames on the second day of the final, extending his winning streak to seven frames and his lead to 14–7, before Higgins pulled two frames back after the mid-session interval. In the second of those frames, Higgins won with a 72 counter-clearance after Williams missed on a break of 65. In the following frame, Higgins started on a maximum break, which had never been achieved in a World Championship final; he potted ten reds with blacks but could not complete the clearance. Nevertheless, he secured his third successive frame with the break of 80, reducing his deficit to 10–14. Williams took the last frame to win the session 5–3, giving him a 15–10 lead heading into the final session of the championship.\nHiggins responded by winning the first five frames of the final session to level the match at 15–15, including three clearances and a match highest break of 131. Williams then won his first frame of the evening, and followed it up with a 100 break to take the score to 17–15, thus requiring one further frame to round off the match. In the 33rd frame, on a break of 63, Williams missed a pink that would have clinched the title; Higgins then cleared the table for a break of 65 to pull the score to 16–17. In the 34th frame, Williams held his nerve to make a match-winning break of 69, concluding the match at 18–16 and securing his third world title.\nOn winning the championship, Williams said \"The turnaround in the past twelve months is something I cannot work out\", after not having appeared in the competition in the previous season. Before the tournament, Williams had said if he won the world title he would attend the post tournament press conference naked. Following his victory, Williams entered the conference wearing only a towel around his waist, but removed it when he was safely seated behind a table. Williams then promised that if he was to win the next season, he would \"cartwheel round here naked\".\nWilliams' victory came fifteen years after his last world title in 2003; this was the longest span between two successive wins in the history of the tournament. At the age of 43, Williams became the oldest world champion since Ray Reardon won the event in 1978 aged 45. At the 2020 World Snooker Championship, O'Sullivan won the event at the age of 44.)\nMain draw.\nThe numbers in parentheses are players' seedings.

In AC competition, the club whose boat is first to win seven races wins the cup and becomes the Defending Club, host, and organizer of the 37th America's Cup, after receiving a valid challenge from a yacht club from another country that meets the conditions of the deed.\nBackground.\nThe 35th edition of the America's cup was held between 17 and 26 June 2017. It was contested between the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, and the defender, Oracle Team USA. Team New Zealand won the cup match with a score of 7 to 1 over Oracle Team USA. The successful challenge made the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron the Defending club for the 36th America's cup.\nThe protocol for the 36th America's cup was released on 29 September 2017 with Auckland, New Zealand as the intended venue for the event. Grant Dalton, the CEO of Emirates Team New Zealand, confirmed that the fashion brand Prada had secured the right to be the exclusive naming and presenting sponsor of all events comprising the 36th America's Cup. This included the Challenger Selection Series which would officially be named The Prada Cup. This replaced the Louis Vuitton Cup that had been used as the Challenger Selection Series between 1983 and 2017.\nThe class rule for the AC75, the foiling monohulls that would be used for the event, was published on 29 March 2018.\nThe three person Arbitration Panel was appointed on 10 May 2018. The chairperson was David Tillett (AUS) who was joined by Henry Peter (SUI) and Graham McKenzie (NZL). All three are respected lawyers who have experience working with previous America's Cup adjudication bodies.\nIn August 2018, an \"America's Cup Overture\" was held in Cowes, England, 167 years after the original America's Cup race occurred at the same location. At the event, Auckland was confirmed as the venue for the cup match and challenger series with the event dates and courses also announced.\nScheduling.\nThe event was originally scheduled to start on 6 March 2021, but was delayed until 10 March due to a COVID-19 lockdown in Auckland. Iain Murray was the race director.\nEntries for challengers opened on 1 January 2018 and closed on 30 June 2018 with late entries accepted until 30 November 2018. Heats for challengers and the defender, known as World Series, were held in 2020 in the brand new AC75 class. Challenger selection series was held in January and February 2021 with the America's Cup match against the defender in March.\nPrior to Emirates Team New Zealand winning the 35th America's Cup in 2017, Oracle (the defender at the time) and four of the five challengers had signed a framework that would have seen the 36th America's Cup in 2019 and the 37th in 2021, with the existing 35th Cup class boats, the AC50s, and a pre-selection America's Cup World Series tournament with the same boats. Team New Zealand, the eventual champion, had opted to not sign the framework agreement, and were not bound by its terms, freeing them to set their defence for 2021 with a brand new format and class.\nChallengers.\nCircolo della Vela Sicilia was the \"Challenger of Record\" for the 36th America's Cup. Their team, Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, currently led by Max Sirena, had previously lost to Emirates Team New Zealand in the 2000 America's Cup, the 2007, and the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup finals. On 13 March 2018, Jimmy Spithill announced he was returning to the team, after his tenure as helmsman in the 2007 America's Cup.\nThe Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron began accepting challenges from further eligible yacht clubs, in addition to the Challenger of Record, on 1 January 2018.\nIneos Team UK entered and was led by Ben Ainslie.\nThe New York Yacht Club (NYYC) entered AC36, under the syndicate name American Magic, with a team led by Terry Hutchinson and funded by Doug DeVos, John J. \"Hap\" Fauth, and Roger Penske. In May 2018 it was announced that Dean Barker would helm the boat. \"American Magic\" refers to the first Cup winner, the yacht \"America\" of 1851, and the first defender, NYYC's yacht \"Magic\", who successfully defended in 1870. The America's Cup trophy was held by the NYYC for 132 years until 1983. The NYYC's reign was the longest winning streak – as measured by years – in the history of all sports.\nAt the close of the late entry notice period, 30 November 2018, eight notices of challenge were submitted to the defender. There was speculation about entries from Australia and China, and second challengers from Italy and the United States. After processing those entries by order of reception, by the end of year 2018 three additional challenges were accepted: Iain Percy and the Royal Malta Yacht Club; a second American challenge from Taylor Canfield and the Long Beach Yacht Club; and a national challenge from the Netherlands issued by Royal Dutch Yacht Club.\nOn 2 April 2019, the New York Yacht Club, through team American Magic, filed for arbitration relating to the acceptance of the three late entry teams. On 15 May 2019, the America's Cup Arbitration Panel released their decision denying American Magic's application and allowed the late entry teams to compete.\nOn 31 May 2019, the Royal Malta Yacht Club announced that they were withdrawing as a challenger.\nOn 1 July 2019, the Koninklijke Nederlandsche Zeil- &amp; Roeivereeniging announced that it was also withdrawing as a challenger, whereas the Long Beach Yacht Club confirmed their ongoing commitment.\nOn 9 December 2020, Stars &amp; Stripes (Long Beach Yacht Club) withdrew from the competition.\nStarting 29 January 2021, Luna Rossa faced the New York Yacht Club in a best-of-7 semifinal for the challenger's Prada Cup; by 30 January, the Italians had completed a 4–0 sweep to advance to the Prada Cup finals. In the best-of-13 finals, Luna Rosa needed only 8 races, ending on 21 February, to defeat the INEOS Team 7–1, advancing from the challenger's pool.\nVenue.\nThe Cup was sailed in New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf, on the east coast of the North Island, outside of Auckland City's Waitematā Harbour as the venue. Italy was announced as the backup venue.\nAuckland had also previously been the venue for the America's Cup in 2000 and 2003.\nInfrastructure work was undertaken in Auckland's Wynyard Quarter to prepare for the event. This included dredging of the Outer Viaduct Harbour, installation of new floating infrastructure such as pontoons, and construction of team bases.\nFive race courses were used, lettered A through to E. Every racing day the race management made a decision on which course would be used.\nDuring the Prada Cup, the Auckland Sky Tower was illuminated in red alongside the event logo projected with a variety of animations. The show occurred on the hour and half hour between 9pm and 2am on race days.\nBoats.\nThe America's Cup races have been contested using many historical classes in the past. For the 2021 series Team ENTZ developed a new class of foiling monohulls named the America's Cup 75 or AC75. The boats were required to be \"constructed in country\". Teams were allowed to build two boats each.\nThe winning yacht of ETNZ is named \"Te Rehutai\", which means 'spirit of the ocean'.\nNationality.\nTwenty percent of sailors in each team were required to have passports from that country. The rest must meet a residency requirement: they must reside in that team's country for 380 days from 1 September 2018 to 1 September 2020.\nQualifying event.\nThe first two of the three planned 2020 America's Cup World Series competitions – in Sardinia and Portsmouth – were cancelled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports. The third event, held over three days in December 2020, was won by Emirates Team New Zealand. A subsequent \"Christmas Race\" was abandoned due to low wind. None were used as a qualification competition.\nThe cancellations of the earlier regattas meant that the third world series event was the first time that the AC75 class had been sailed in competition anywhere, including by the competitors themselves, before the qualifying series. The successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand meant that local activities were able to continue according to schedule and with minimal disruption – including the fact of spectators being allowed to gather in groups to view the event in-person, something which had been forbidden at nearly all major sporting events around the world during 2020.\nThe 2021 Prada Cup was held in Auckland between 15 January and 21 February 2021. It was the competition to determine the official challenger. It started with a quadruple Round-robin tournament, to determine a seeding, which Ineos Team UK won undefeated. The round-robin was notable for the capsize of American Magic in its fourth match and subsequent forfeiture of the rest of the round-robin races while the team effected major repairs. Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli (2nd in the round-robin) went on to beat American Magic 4–0 in a semi-final series to advance to the final. Luna Rossa then won the final series against Ineos UK by 7–1 – thereby becoming the official challenger for the America's Cup against defender Emirates Team New Zealand. Detection of COVID-19 cases in Auckland led to an increase in alert level by the New Zealand Government that caused disruption to the racing and spectator access during the latter stages of the final series.\nCup match.\nThe America's Cup was a best of 13 race series. Races were originally to be held from 6–15 March 2021, with two races per day on 6–7 March, 10 March, and 12–15 March, with additional \"reserve days\" available if poor weather necessitates a delay. On 28 February, the New Zealand Government announced that Auckland would move into lockdown for at least 7 days due to a resurgence of COVID-19. This caused the postponement of race days 1 and 2 (originally scheduled to be held on 6–7 March). On 5 March, the revised schedule was released, with racing starting on 10 March and ending 17 March.\nNotes:\nTeam New Zealand retained the America's Cup trophy that they had won in 2017, winning the best of 13 series by 7 races to 3. The Italian team won three of the first five races, but New Zealand won five straight to keep the title. This was their fourth victory, following earlier wins in 1995 and 2000. The turning point came in the eighth race, where New Zealand clawed back a four-minute deficit to win and take a 5–3 lead, just as their opponents looked to be drawing level in the series. The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, commented that \"Team New Zealand has once again made us all so proud by retaining the America’s Cup...we want to see it all over again in 2023\".\nBroadcasting.\nThe event was also streamed live on YouTube, Facebook and its own website.\nIn 2018, TVNZ secured the exclusive New Zealand broadcast rights for the cup and it's preliminary events. This meant that all racing would be broadcast live on free-to-air TV and live streamed on TVNZ OnDemand. Grant Dalton, the CEO of Team New Zealand, said that \"It has been a fundamental principle of Emirates Team New Zealand and the Challenger of Record that the America’s Cup be accessible to as many Kiwis as possible since we won the trophy back almost one year ago. TVNZ have committed to provide coverage of this America’s Cup like no other, so we are delighted that the America’s Cup Match Presented by Prada and all preceding events will be broadcast live and free to air for all New Zealanders to watch and be part of.\""

The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out. In the final, which was played as a single match, if scores were level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if scores remained tied.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\n&lt;section begin=R16 /&gt;\nThe draw for the round of 16 was held on 11 December 2017, 12:00 CET.&lt;section end=R16 /&gt;\nWith five English teams in the round of 16, this was the first time five teams from one association qualified for the Champions League knockout phase.\nSummary.\n&lt;section begin=R16 /&gt;\nThe first legs were played on 13, 14, 20 and 21 February, and the second legs were played on 6, 7, 13 and 14 March 2018.\nMatches.\n\"Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Manchester City won 5–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Liverpool won 5–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Sevilla won 2–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Real Madrid won 5–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"2–2 on aggregate.

        "text": "Sterling Damarco Brown (born February 10, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for Alba Berlin of the German Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) and the EuroLeague. He played college basketball for Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 2013 to 2017. As a senior, he earned second-team all-conference honors in the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Brown was drafted 46th overall in the 2017 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers.\nHigh school and college career.\nBrown is the son of Chris Brown who was a police officer in the Chicago metropolitan area for 30 years in Maywood, Illinois. Brown played high school basketball at Proviso East High School in Maywood, Illinois. Playing for coach Donnie Boyce, he led the Pirates to a state runner-up finish in 2012 and a state semi-final appearance in 2013, losing both times to the Jabari Parker-led Simeon Career Academy. Brown ultimately selected SMU and coach Larry Brown over Miami, Tennessee and Xavier.\nBrown and the Mustang class of 2017 endured three years of adversity as they missed the NCAA tournament in his freshman season. The following season, they were upset in the first round of the Tournament. In his junior year, SMU served an NCAA probation in 2015–16. In his senior season, Brown averaged 13.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Along with Semi Ojeleye he led the Mustangs to a 30–5 record and regular-season and Tournament American Athletic Conference championships. At the close of the season, Brown was named second-team All-conference. Brown finished his Mustang career as the school's all-time leader in wins.\nProfessional career.\nMilwaukee Bucks (2017–2020).\nFollowing the close of his college career, Brown raised his profile by appearing in the NABC College All-Star game and attended the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament. He was considered a potential second-round prospect for the 2017 NBA draft. Brown was drafted in the second round with the 46th pick of the 2017 NBA draft by the Philadelphia 76ers. On July 6, 2017, his draft rights were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for cash considerations. Brown appeared in his first NBA game on October 20, 2017, against the Cleveland Cavaliers, posting three points in six minutes in Milwaukee's second game of the season. On November 3, 2018, Brown was assigned to the Wisconsin Herd. In his first game of the 2018–19 season, he scored 22 points on 10-of-17 from the field. When Malcolm Brogdon was unavailable on January 20, 2018, against Philadelphia, Brown started and scored 14 points. He posted a season-high 15 points on March 7, against the Houston Rockets.\nOn January 26, 2018, Brown was tased and arrested inappropriately according to the Milwaukee Police Department Police Chief Alfonso Morales the following May. Brown brought suit in June 2018 after the May release of bodycam footage and alleges racial profiling occurred in the administration of a parking ticket at a Walgreens parking lot. After the incident an investigation was launched which resulted in 8 officers disciplined, with 3 of them suspended and 1 officer terminated.\nIn October 2019, Brown rejected a $400,000 settlement offer from the Milwaukee City Council. The high settlement offer was a legal maneuver intended to take advantage of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 68. Under Rule 68 Sterling is responsible for the city's legal fees and incurred expenses if he loses the case or wins damages less than $400,000. Brown expressed that he rejected the offer in part due to his ability and sense of responsibility to use his platform as an NBA player to raise awareness. Brown's attorney, Mark Thomsen, condemned the settlement offer, saying it was the city's attempt to save face instead of admitting wrongdoing. As of November 27, 2019, court filings indicate that a federal civil rights lawsuit is proceeding to trial.\nOn March 31, 2019, Brown posted a career-high 27 points, including a go-ahead layup with 1.1 seconds remaining in overtime against the Atlanta Hawks.\nHouston Rockets (2020–2021).\nOn November 26, 2020, Brown signed with the Houston Rockets.\nOn April 18, 2021, Brown suffered serious facial injuries during a fight outside of a Miami night club.\nDallas Mavericks (2021–2022).\nBrown signed with the Dallas Mavericks on August 10, 2021. He made his debut on October 21, 2021, in an 87–113 loss to the Atlanta Hawks, scoring three points.\nOn June 24, 2022, Brown was traded alongside Boban Marjanović, Trey Burke, Marquese Chriss, and the draft rights to Wendell Moore Jr., to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Christian Wood.\nOn September 30, 2022, Brown was traded, along with David Nwaba, Trey Burke, and Marquese Chriss, to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Derrick Favors, Ty Jerome, Maurice Harkless, Théo Maledon and a future second-round pick. On October 2, Brown was waived by the Thunder.\nRaptors 905 / Los Angeles Lakers (2022–2023).\nOn December 17, 2022, Brown signed with Raptors 905 of the NBA G League.\nOn January 6, 2023, Brown signed a ten-day contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, appearing in four games. On January 16, he was re-acquired by Raptors 905 after his contract with the Lakers expired.\nAlba Berlin (2023–present).\nOn August 15, 2023, Brown signed with Basketball Bundesliga and EuroLeague club Alba Berlin.\n2018 Milwaukee police incident.\nOn January 26, 2018, at 2 am, Brown was approached by a Milwaukee police officer because his car was straddling two handicapped parking spaces. This occurred in a nearly empty Walgreens parking lot on the south end of the city, the intersection of South 27th street and National Ave. After Brown interacted with the officer, who requested backup, a number of officers arrived on scene. Several minutes after the first officer began talking with Brown, an officer yelled at Brown to remove his hands from the pockets of his hoodie. Brown responded, \"I’ve got stuff in my hands\". He was subsequently tackled to the ground and tased. Brown was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest, but the case was not referred to prosecutors after an internal review.\nFour months later, the Milwaukee Police Department released the approximately 30-minute video taken by police body camera. After negative public reaction, the Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales indicated that the officers had been disciplined for acting \"inappropriately\". Brown called the incident \"an attempt at police intimidation, followed by the unlawful use of physical force.\"\nOn May 4 in a 14–0 vote, the City of Milwaukee Common Council approved a $750,000 settlement with Sterling Brown over the 2018 incident with police. Although the settlement contained no admission of constitutional rights violations, it did contain an apology and recognition of an unnecessary escalation despite Brown's calm behavior. Officers involved in the action have been suspended, reassigned, and others required to undergo retraining. Moreover, the settlement called for a change in police tactics and institutes a set of anti-racist policing policies and procedures that discipline officers for violating civil and human rights. The settlement also includes a new requirement that officers log every event in which an officer draws a gun.\nPersonal life.\nSterling Brown is the younger brother of two-time NBA champion Shannon Brown."

Led by first-year head coach Brad Underwood, the Illini played their home games at State Farm Center in Champaign, Illinois as members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 14–18, 4–14 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for 11th place. As the No. 13 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost in the first round to Iowa.\nPrevious season.\nThe Illini finished the 2016–17 season 20–15, 8–10 in Big Ten play to finish in ninth place. They lost in the second round of the Big Ten tournament to Michigan. They received an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated Valparaiso and Boise State before losing in the quarterfinals to UCF.\nOn March 11, 2017, Illinois fired head coach John Groce. On March 18, the school hired Brad Underwood as the new head coach.\nOffseason.\nCoaching changes.\nFollowing Brad Underwood's hiring as head coach, Jamall Walker was retained as an assistant. Underwood hired controversial former South Florida head coach Orlando Antigua who was fired as head coach from South Florida due to an NCAA investigation into academic violations. Underwood also hired Ron Coleman as an assistant and Stephen Gentry as assistant to the head coach.\nDecommits.\nOn January 16, 2016, three-star shooting guard Javon Pickett of Belleville, Illinois verbally committed to attend Illinois in the fall of 2017. After the firing of John Groce, Pickett asked for and received a release of his letter of intent to Illinois. On November 17, 2016, four-star recruit Jeremiah Tilmon announced that he had signed his letter of intent with Illinois the previous day, after a week of press uncertainty. However, after the coaching change at Illinois, Tilmon requested and received a release of his letter of intent with the school.\n2017 recruiting class.\nDuring Illinois' final home game against Minnesota on February 28, 2016, Da'Monte Williams verbally committed to attend Illinois in the fall of 2017.

On June 12, Slovenian bigman Matic Vesel committed to Illinois.\nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018 Big Ten tournament was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Due to the Big East's use of that venue for their conference tournament, the Big Ten tournament took place one week earlier than usual, ending the week before Selection Sunday.

They played their home games at Charles Koch Arena in Wichita, Kansas and are led by 11th-year head coach Gregg Marshall. The season marked the Shockers' first season as members of the American Athletic Conference. They finished the season 25–8, 14–4 in AAC play to finish a tie for second place. As the No. 2 seed in the AAC tournament, they defeated Temple in the quarterfinals before losing to Houston in the semifinals. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament for the seventh season. As the No. 4 seed in the East region, they were upset in the first round by Marshall.\nPrevious season.\nThe Shockers finished the 2016–17 season 31–5, 17–1 to finish in a tie for first place in MVC play. In the MVC tournament, they beat Bradley, Missouri State, and Illinois State to win the tournament championship. As a result, they earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. As the No. 10 seed in the South region (considered by everyone to be too high), they defeated No. 7 Dayton in the first round before losing to No. 2 Kentucky in the second round.\nThe season marked the Shockers' final season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference as the school announced on April 7, 2017 that it would be joining the American Athletic Conference effective July 1, 2017.\nOffseason.\nReturning players.\nIt was expected that the Shockers would return all five starters and nearly all of their scholarship players from the prior season. The only two seniors on the prior season's roster, Zach Bush and John Robert Simon, were walk-ons. Two underclass players, rising junior Eric Hamilton and rising senior Daishon Smith, announced plans to transfer from Wichita State. Hamilton had been a little-used reserve; Smith had started at point guard at the beginning of the 2016–17 season, but lost his starting position to Landry Shamet and was seeing relatively little playing time by the end of the season.\nTwo other players, Markis McDuffie and Shaquille Morris, declared for the 2017 NBA draft, but neither hired an agent, allowing them to return to Wichita State if they withdrew from the draft within 10 days of the end of the mid-May NBA Draft Combine (specifically May 24). Both withdrew from the draft the day before the deadline.\n2017 recruiting class.\nSource\nInjuries.\nOn July 21, 2017, point guard Landry Shamet, a potential All-American, suffered a stress fracture in his right foot and would need surgery. He was expected to miss 12–16 weeks to recover from the injury. Shamet was expected to be ready for the team's season opener on November 10, and that proved true, as he scored 17 points in only 17 minutes of action in the Shockers' 109–57 blowout of UMKC and, according to the Associated Press, \"looked completely recovered\".\nShortly before practices began on September 29, it was announced that Markis McDuffie would be sidelined with a stress fracture in his left foot. It was expected that he would miss a majority of the non-conference schedule, but would return some time in late December. McDuffie returned for the final non-conference game on December 22 game against Florida Gulf Coast.\nPreseason.\nAt the conference's annual media day, the Shockers were narrowly picked to finish second in the AAC, receiving five of the 12 first place votes.

        "text": "The 1991 UAAP men's basketball tournament was the 54th year of the men's tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s basketball championship. Hosted by University of the Philippines. The season opens on July 20 at the Araneta Coliseum. The year's theme \"Ang UAAP sa Siglo 2000: Palaro'y Paunlarin, Pagkatao'y Pagtibayin\" signifies the UAAP's efforts at strengthening the values of healthy competition, friendship and sportsmanship in the pursuit of physical excellence.\nFar Eastern University won their first title since 1983 and 12th overall on October 12 when De La Salle University did not show up in the ordered replay of their championship match.\nElimination round.\nTournament format:\nSeason host is boldfaced. &lt;br&gt;Standings a bit unclear if FEU and UST finished with 11-3 or 10-4.\n&lt;br&gt;\nFirst round standings: La Salle and FEU (6-1), UST (5-2), UP (4-3), Ateneo and Adamson (3-4), UE (1-6) and NU (0-7).\nOn September 28 at the Loyola Gym, La Salle and FEU, both tied at first place with 10 wins and two losses, played in a crucial match for the first finals berth and a twice-to-beat advantage in the championship. De La Salle Green Archers prevailed over the FEU Tamaraws, 80-75, and avenged their only loss in the first round to the Tamaraws, 80-82, last August 3.\nFar Eastern University Tamaraws sealed a repeat of the 1989 varsity championship with De La Salle by defeating University of Santo Tomas Glowing Goldies, 95-89, in a playoff on October 2.\nFinals.\nGame 1.\nThe Green Archers came out on top, registering an 80-77 victory over FEU. There was a technical error committed by the officials working the game. The error in question came in the last 2:26 of the game and La Salle ahead. The table officials failed to notify the referees of the game that La Sallite Tony Espinosa had already his fifth final foul against the driving Johnny Abarrientos.\nEspinosa was still able to play for a few seconds more before FEU coach Arturo Valenzona and team manager Anton Montinola were able to approach the table officials to point out the mistake. The game was delayed for about five minutes. When play resumed, UAAP commissioner Boy Codiñera and his officials failed to slap the necessary technical foul on De La Salle.\nThe Green Archers went on to win the game. But when FEU team captain Victor Pablo signed the official scoreboard, he placed the game under protest. The UAAP board deferred the traditional post-game award. They wanted to wait until a decision on FEU's protest could be reached.\nTwo days of apprehension, protest, and Tuesday's marathon hearings, UAAP officials ordered a replay of the championship match.\nGame 1 replay.\nThe Green Archers of De La Salle University never showed up for the UAAP championship replay on October 12. As a result, the UAAP board declared on that Saturday the FEU Tamaraws as the 1991 UAAP champions."

        "title": "2017 Preakness Stakes",
        "text": "The 2017 Preakness Stakes was the 142nd running of the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the American Triple Crown. It is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds at a distance of and was held on May 20, 2017, at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The race went off at 6:51 pm ET and was broadcast by NBC. The race was won by Cloud Computing, upsetting Always Dreaming's chances of a Triple Crown. Classic Empire was second, and Senior Investment finished third.\nThe Maryland Jockey Club reported a track record total attendance of 140,327, the second highest attendance for American thoroughbred racing events in North America during 2017.\nField.\nThe field for the race included ten horses, led by Always Dreaming, the winner of the 2017 Kentucky Derby. Always Dreaming arrived at Pimlico on May 9 and was put in Stall 40 of the Preakness Stakes Barn, which is traditionally reserved for the Derby winner. His main challenger was expected to be Classic Empire, who finished fourth in the Derby despite being heavily bumped at the start. Other leading entries include Lookin at Lee (2nd in the Derby), Gunnevera (7th) and Hence (11th). Cloud Computing had qualified for the Derby in the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby point system, but his connections decided to bypass that race to focus on the Preakness.\nThe field also included several horses who did not qualify for the Derby, including Conquest Mo Money, who had to be supplemented to the Preakness at a cost of $150,000 as he had not been nominated to the Triple Crown series earlier in the year. Royal Mo was originally scheduled to enter the Preakness but injured himself during a workout and was retired.\nThe draw for post positions was held on May 17. Rivals Always Dreaming and Classic Empire drew posts 4 and 5, setting up a head-to-head matchup of the two morning line favorites.\nRace description.\nDespite rain the night before the race, the track dried out over the course of the day and was listed as fast for the Preakness. The race drew a record crowd of 140,327 beating the previous year's record of 135,256. The pari-mutuel take of $97,168,658 for the entire day's races also broke the previous record of $94,127,424 from 2016.\nAlways Dreaming and Classic Empire went to the early lead and set a solid pace while Cloud Computing rated a few lengths behind in third. Around the final turn, Classic Empire surged to the lead, but Always Dreaming tired and dropped back. In mid-stretch, Classic Empire had a three-length lead and looked the likely winner before Cloud Computing angled out from traffic and started closing ground rapidly. Classic Empire tried to rally but could not hold off Cloud Computing, who won by a head.\nCloud Computing became just the fourth horse in the last 34 years to win the Preakness after not having raced in the Derby. The last horse to do so was the filly Rachel Alexandra in 2009. It was the first win of a Triple Crown race for his trainer Chad Brown and the second for jockey Javier Castellano, who was riding the colt for the first time. It was also the first Preakness win for owners Seth Klarman of Klaravich Stables and William Lawrence. Having grown up in Baltimore just a few blocks away from Pimlico, Klarman called the win incredibly special. \"I think possibly some of the reason we won today was because we were patient and didn't throw an inexperienced horse against a 20-horse field in the Derby on a very difficult track\", he said.\n\"I'm not going to dispute the fact that I brought in a fresh horse as part of our strategy\", said Brown. \"Classic Empire and Always Dreaming are two outstanding horses and our strategy was, if we were going to ever beat them, let's take them on two weeks' rest when we have six, and it worked.\"\nResult.\nThe results of the race were as follows:\n \nTimes: mile – 0:23.16; mile – 0:46.81; mile – 1:11.00; mile – 1:36.63; final – 1:55.98.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:23.16) (:23.65) (:24.19) (:25.63) (:19.35 for final )\nPayout.\nThe 142nd Preakness payout schedule"

        "text": "The 2017 European Rugby Champions Cup Final was the final match in the 2016–17 European Rugby Champions Cup, and the twenty-second European club rugby final in general. It was contested by defending champions Saracens of England and French side Clermont at Murrayfield Stadium, in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Saturday 13 May 2017.\nSaracens retained the trophy after claiming a 28–17 victory.\nBackground.\nReigning champions Saracens entered the final aiming to defend their title, having won the Champions Cup for the first time in their history when they defeated Racing 92 by 21–9 in the 2016 final. The club was also looking to set a new record for most unbeaten European fixtures in a row, after matching the record of 17 held by Leinster. Meanwhile, Clermont were seeking their first top-tier European trophy, following two prior defeats in the 2013 and 2015 finals, both against Toulon.\nFor the second year running, Welsh referee Nigel Owens officiated the Champions Cup final – in doing so, he also became the first official to referee 100 European club rugby matches.\nRoute to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away).\"\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter both teams enjoyed attacking spells in the opening 10 minutes without putting points on the board, Saracens opened the scoring when the ball was spread towards the right wing to Alex Goode, who placed a grubber kick behind the Clermont defenders which was collected by Chris Ashton. The try, which could not be converted, saw Ashton overtake Vincent Clerc as the top try scorer in European rugby history. Saracens extended their lead soon after when lock George Kruis powered over from close range for the team's second try, this time converted successfully by Owen Farrell. A short time later, Clermont responded when a break by Aurélien Rougerie set up centre Rémi Lamerat for their first try of the game, converted by scrum-half Morgan Parra. This left the half-time score at 12–7 to Saracens.\nIn the second half, the first ten minutes again went scoreless, until a Farrell penalty. Clermont then brought the game to within just one point via a team move, which started with full-back Scott Spedding counter-attacking from his own try line and ended with winger Nick Abendanon going over for the try, converted again by Parra. Following an exchange of penalties between Farrell and Parra, which kept the scoreline at a one-point advantage to Saracens, each team had try-scoring opportunities, but to no avail. Finally, in the closing stages, Saracens made their persistent pressure count when Goode crossed the line for a try in the corner, with Farrell landing a difficult conversion from out wide. With one last penalty, Saracens cemented their victory at 28–17, becoming only the fourth reigning champions in the tournament's 22-year history to successfully retain their title.\nSaracens Number 8 Billy Vunipola was named the official Man of the Match, while fly-half Owen Farrell was presented with the 2017 ERCC Player of the Year Award. In securing victory, Saracens also achieved a record 18 consecutive unbeaten European games – a record stretching back to the first round of the 2015–2016 cup."

        "text": "The 2018 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2017–18 season and conclusion of the season's playoffs. In this best-of-seven playoff, the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors swept the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers four games to zero. The Warriors became the 7th NBA franchise to win back-to-back championships, joining the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons, Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, and Miami Heat. This year's Finals was the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row. This was also the first time that a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007, in which the Cavaliers were also the losing team. LeBron James, in his eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance and ninth appearance overall, suffered the second Finals sweep of his career, having also played in the 2007 Finals. Warriors small forward Kevin Durant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\nThe Warriors entered the series having home-court advantage with a regular season record of , compared to the Cavaliers' regular season record of . Entering the matchup, the Warriors were also noted by various sports media outlets as one of the biggest NBA Finals favorites in recent history. The 2018 Finals began on May 31 and ended on June 8. The series broke the record set by the 2014 NBA Finals for highest average scoring differential per game (15.0) for an NBA Finals series. \nBackground.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThis was the Golden State Warriors' fourth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals. During the 2017–18 offseason, the Warriors re-signed their core players, including Kevin Durant to a two-year, $53 million contract and point guard Stephen Curry to a five-year contract worth $201 million. Golden State also re-signed Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Zaza Pachulia, and David West. A major free agent acquired during the offseason was guard Nick Young.\nThe Warriors finished the 2017–18 regular season with a 58–24 record, winning the Pacific Division and securing the 2nd seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Golden State defeated the San Antonio Spurs in five games in the first round, eliminated the New Orleans Pelicans in five games in the Western Conference semifinals, and despite major obstacles, they defeated the top-seeded Houston Rockets in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\nThe Warriors entered the series as heavy favorites, aiming to repeat back-to-back titles after losing their quest in 2016.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nThis was the Cleveland Cavaliers' fourth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and fifth appearance overall. This was also the eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance for Cavaliers small forward LeBron James.\nPrior to the 2017–18 season, All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving requested to be traded away from the Cavaliers. Although James was against the idea of trading him away, the Cavaliers agreed to Irving's request, trading him to the Boston Celtics in exchange for point guard Isaiah Thomas, small forward Jae Crowder, center Ante Žižić, the first-round pick from the Brooklyn Nets in the 2018 NBA draft and the Miami Heat's 2020 second round pick. Miami's second round pick was added as compensation after Isaiah Thomas failed his physical. Other major changes included shooting guard Dwyane Wade signing with the Cavaliers, thus reuniting with James from their time together on the Big Three-era Miami Heat, and the signing of point guard Derrick Rose to a one-year contract.\nOn February 8, 2018 – just before the NBA trade deadline – the Cavaliers radically changed their roster in a little more than an hour, acquiring George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, and Larry Nance Jr. in exchange for Thomas, Rose, Crowder, Wade, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, and their own 2018 first-round pick. Multiple writers argued at the time that the trades made the Cavaliers significantly better.\nThe Cavaliers finished the regular season with a 50–32 record, securing the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games in the first round, swept the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and defeated the Boston Celtics in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals.\nRegular season series.\nThe Warriors won the regular season series 2–0.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nKlay Thompson of the Warriors suffered a leg injury in the first quarter, but returned to the game in the second quarter. With the score tied at 107 in the last five seconds of regulation, J. R. Smith of the Cavaliers collected an offensive rebound following a missed free throw, but dribbled the ball towards half court rather than taking a final shot. Tyronn Lue, Cleveland's coach, later said that Smith thought the Cavaliers were ahead, though Smith denied not knowing the correct score, and claimed he assumed his team would take a time-out. Cleveland was not able to score in the final seconds and the game went to overtime. In overtime, the Warriors outscored the Cavaliers 17–7 to win the game. Tristan Thompson was ejected following a flagrant foul with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime.\nCleveland's LeBron James scored 51 points in Game 1, the sixth-highest point total for an NBA Finals game and the most in a loss. After Game 1, James punched a whiteboard in the Cavaliers' locker room due to frustration of his team's level of play, suffering a bone contusion in his hand that he kept private for the remainder of the series.\nGame 2.\nThe Warriors employed more double teams against James in Game 2, limiting him to 29 points. Cleveland had a 41% field goal percentage, including 9-for-27 (33.3%) on three-point field goals. Meanwhile, Golden State's Stephen Curry set an NBA Finals record in Game 2 with nine three-point field goals. He scored 33 points, while the Warriors got 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists from Kevin Durant, and 20 points from Klay Thompson. Smith struggled for Cleveland, shooting 2-for-9 (22.2%) with both baskets coming in the first quarter. The Warriors won 122–103 over the Cavaliers.\nGame 3.\nAndre Iguodala of the Warriors, who missed the previous six games, including the first two games of the NBA Finals, due to a left leg injury, returned in Game 3.

Woods beat his times at the combine in the 40-yard dash (4.51), 20-yard dash (2.59), and 10-yard dash (1.58) while also performing positional drills for scouts and team representatives from all 32 NFL teams. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Woods was projected by NFL draft experts and scouts to be selected anywhere from the fourth to sixth rounds. He was ranked as the seventh best strong safety in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com.\nDallas Cowboys.\nWoods was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (191st overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft.

On November 12, he collected four combined tackles, defended a pass, and made his first career interception off a deflected pass from Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan during a 27-7 loss. The following week, Woods earned his first career start at strong safety after Jeff Heath suffered a concussion the previous week against the Falcons. He recorded five combined tackles as the Cowboys were routed by the Philadelphia Eagles 37-9. In Week 11, Woods earned the starting strong safety job and recorded three combined tackles during a 38-14 win against the Washington Redskins. Because of injuries to other players he was moved between safety and slot cornerback during the season, and although he had some problems tackling, he finished with 41 tackles, one interception, 6 passes defensed, 4 quarterback pressures and one fumble recovery.\nIn 2018, Byron Jones was moved to right cornerback and Woods was named the regular starter at free safety in the organized team activities.

In Week 9, he recorded an interception and a forced fumble in a 37-18 win over the New York Giants, earning him NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors.\nIn 2020, he was expected to take a leap in his contribution on the field, but he struggled along with the rest of the defense during the season. He also faced criticism in the media, after being quoted as saying: \"I mean, on certain plays some guys, I mean, me included, there may be a lack, but overall the effort is there. I mean, you don't expect, we're in the NFL, you don't expect guys full speed for 70 plays. That's not possible. But you're going to push all you can. I mean, we know. You don't expect a backside corner to make a play on the opposite side. If he's running full speed the whole time, it's just not possible, to be honest\", which Woods maintained that it was taken out of context and that it was not indicative of the team's commitment or effort. He missed the fifteenth game against the Eagles with a rib injury and was replaced with Darian Thompson. He collected 86 tackles (second on the team), 2 tackles for loss, one pass defensed and did not force any turnovers.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nOn March 30, 2021, Woods signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings.\nCarolina Panthers.\nOn March 16, 2022, Woods signed a three-year, $15.75 million contract with the Carolina Panthers."

Alternatively, the inside edge can refer to that particular edge of the bat itself.\nInside edges, which frequently result in batsmen playing the ball on to the wicket and being bowled out called \"Played On\" are typically unintentional on the batsman's part, particularly as it is hard to predict the direction the ball will take upon clipping the inside edge of the bat.\nInside edges often result in the more embarrassingly painful injuries for batsmen, as the ball juts up after hitting the inside edge and hits the batsmen in the inner thigh or groin area.

CNN president Jeff Zucker, who had also become head of WarnerMedia's sports properties after a reorganization, explained that \"it's a sign of understanding when things don't necessarily go as well as you would hope you change it. So there's no shame in that. At the end of the day, you have to give the fans what they want.\" The show attracted its highest viewership since 2014 and averaged a 4.0 share on Nielsen overnight ratings.\nCommentary teams.\nESPN International had international rights to the tournament. Coverage uses CBS/Turner play-by-play teams until the Final Four.\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament.\nInternet.\nVideo.\nLive video of games was available for streaming through the following means:\nIn addition, the March Madness app offered Fast Break, whiparound coverage of games similar to NFL RedZone.\nAudio.\nLive audio of games was available for streaming through the following means:"

        "text": "The 2018 William Hill World Darts Championship was a darts event, held between 14 December 2017 and 1 January 2018 at the Alexandra Palace in London, United Kingdom. It was the 25th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation.\nMichael van Gerwen was the defending champion, but lost 6–5 in sets to Rob Cross in the semi-finals, with the score at 5–5 in sets and with van Gerwen leading 5–4 in legs he missed 5 match darts to beat Cross. Cross forced an 11th and sudden death leg, van Gerwen missed a 6th match dart before Cross hit double 8 to win an epic semi-final and reach his first world final. Cross went on to win the World Championship on his debut by defeating Phil Taylor 7–2 in the final. Cross only turned professional 11 months prior to the event. This was Taylor's 29th and final World Championship, surpassing the record of 28 appearances he jointly held with John Lowe.\nJamie Lewis became the first player to reach the semi-finals after entering the championship through a preliminary round event, first introduced at the 2004 Championship. Lewis eventually fell to Taylor in the semi-final, by a score of 6–1.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money for the tournament was a record high of £1,800,000 in total. The winner's prize money increased from £350,000 to £400,000. \nQualification.\nQualifiers.\nOrder of Merit\nPro Tour\nPDPA Qualifier\n\"First round qualifier\"\n\"Preliminary round qualifiers\"\nInternational qualifiers (Alphabetical order)\n\"First round qualifiers\"\n\"Preliminary round qualifiers\"\nBackground.\n72 players competed in the championship; with the 32 highest ranked players on the PDC Order of Merit being seeded, and the next sixteen highest ranked players from the 2017 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit and the top eight ranked players from a number of international and invitational qualifiers also going straight into the first round. The remaining sixteen international and invitational qualifiers competed in a preliminary round.\nMichael van Gerwen, the winner of the 2014 and 2017 championships, was top of the two-year PDC Order of Merit and number one seed going into the tournament. The tournament was to be the last for Phil Taylor, who had won the PDC World Championship fourteen times previously, most recently in 2013. As well as van Gerwen and Taylor, three other previous PDC world champions qualified as seeds, two-time champions Gary Anderson and Adrian Lewis, and 2007 champion Raymond van Barneveld.\nThe top seeds below van Gerwen were 2017 UK Open winner Peter Wright, Gary Anderson, 2017 World Grand Prix winner Daryl Gurney and 2017 Champions League of Darts winner Mensur Suljović. Rob Cross, the runner-up at the 2017 European Championship, made his World Championship debut as the 20th seed.\nRichard North, in his debut year, was the highest ranked non-seed on the 2017 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit. As well as North, three other qualifiers through the Pro Tour made their debut, Peter Jacques, Steve Lennon and Martin Schindler. The list of qualifiers also included the 2017 Youth Champion Dimitri Van den Bergh and the 2004 runner-up Kevin Painter.\nAmongst the international and invitational qualification tournaments there was, for the first time, a South and Central American Qualifier. The majority of tournaments were the same as had been for the previous championship, but there was no longer a Philippines Championship. Gordon Mathers was the first player to qualify for the Championships, having finished top of the Dartplayers Australia rankings. The top two players on the Nordic &amp; Baltic rankings also qualified, as did the winners of the fifteen international qualifiers, including the 2017 PDC World Youth Championship.\nThe final four qualification places were announced on 19 October, with places being given to the highest ranked Eastern European, Krzysztof Ratajski, the National Darts Federation of Canada number one Jeff Smith, the highest ranked African, Devon Petersen, and the then-undetermined 2017 Development Tour winner, Luke Humphries. The sudden announcement of these places, and the granting of them to Ratajski, who had declined an invitation to the rival 2018 BDO World Darts Championship before failing to qualify through the 2017 PDC Pro Tour Order of Merit; and Jeff Smith, who had failed to qualify for the BDO World Darts Championship and not played a single PDC event in the previous year, were criticized by some, with ITV4 pundit and tour card holder Paul Nicholson saying he had written to the Professional Darts Players Association to seek clarification over the placings.\nThe final three placings were determined by the PDPA qualifier held at Arena MK on 27 November, with Ted Evetts securing a first round place by winning the tournament, and runner-up Brendan Dolan and third-place playoff winner Jamie Lewis both qualifying to the preliminary round. The third place had become available as the 2017 PDC World Youth Championship, which carries a qualification place, was won by Dimitri Van den Bergh, who qualified through the Pro Tour Order of Merit.\n15 of the international and invitational qualifiers were making their PDC World Championship debuts, Seigo Asada, Willard Bruguier, Ted Evetts, Cody Harris, Luke Humphries, Kai Fan Leung, Alan Ljubić, Gordon Mathers, Kenny Neyens, William O'Connor, Diogo Portela, Krzysztof Ratajski, Bernie Smith, Jeff Smith, and Zong Xiao Chen. Portela was the first ever Brazilian to qualify for the World Championships.\nSummary.\nThe top quarter of the draw saw reigning champion Michael van Gerwen dominate, knocking fellow Dutchman Christian Kist out in the first round, before defeating James Wilson, without losing any of the twelve legs played, and Gerwyn Price, to set up a quarter-final with fellow Dutch former world champion Raymond van Barneveld. In the quarter-final, van Gerwen took an early lead, but missed a dart in the fifth set to take a 4–1 lead and ended up being pulled back to 3–3. The two took one more set each before van Gerwen won the deciding set 3–1 to qualify for the semi-final.\nIn the second quarter, the fourth seed, Daryl Gurney, was eliminated in the second round by John Henderson. Debutant Rob Cross defeated Michael Smith in the second round after Smith missed two match darts, and Cross went on to defeat Henderson to set up a quarter-final against the World Youth Champion Dimitri Van den Bergh, who had defeated fifth seed Mensur Suljović in the third round. In the quarter-final, Cross led his Belgian opponent early on, leading 4–1 in the best-of-nine match after five sets. Van den Bergh took the next three sets in succession, setting up a decider which Cross won 3–1, hitting double one in the final leg to qualify for the semi-final.\nThe two highest-ranked seeds in the third quarter fell early on. Two-time champion and seventh seed Adrian Lewis was knocked out in the first round by German qualifier Kevin Münch, while the second seed Peter Wright was knocked out in the second round by Jamie Lewis, who had qualified for the event by coming third in the final PDPA Qualifier. Welshman Jamie Lewis went past the unseeded James Richardson in the third round, becoming the first player to go from the preliminary round to the quarter-final in the history of the championship; before whitewashing Darren Webster to reach the semi-final.\nTwo former world champions, two-time champion Gary Anderson and retiring sixteen-time champion Phil Taylor, met in the last quarter-final. Anderson's run to the quarter-final included a second round win over 63-year-old Singaporean, Paul Lim, a match noted for a leg in which Lim, who in 1990 had become the first player to throw a perfect nine-dart leg in the World Darts Championship, missed a dart at double twelve to repeat the feat. Taylor had faced English opposition in his three previous rounds, beating Chris Dobey in the first round before whitewashing Justin Pipe and Keegan Brown in the next two rounds to set up the quarter-final. Taylor took a 4–1 lead after winning six consecutive legs, and despite Anderson winning the next two sets, Taylor took advantage of missed darts in the eighth set to triumph, 5–3.\nThe semi-final between Taylor and Lewis was the first to be played, and, despite Lewis winning the first set, Taylor took the next three, with Lewis having missed darts in all three sets to have potentially been 4–0 up. Taylor won the next two sets as well, before Lewis took the first two legs in the seventh set, with Taylor taking advantage of three missed set darts from Lewis to steal the set and qualify for the twenty-first World Darts Championship final in his career.\nIn the second semi-final, debutant Cross took on reigning world champion van Gerwen. The first eight sets in the match all went with throw, with Cross taking a lead before being pegged back by van Gerwen. Michael van Gerwen got the first break in the ninth set, taking a 5–4 lead to throw for the match, but Cross fought back to win the tenth set 3–1 to force a deciding set. In the deciding set – which had to be won by two clear legs until the eleventh leg was reached – Cross missed a match-winning dart at the bull with the score at 3–2, before van Gerwen won two legs in succession to take a 5–4 lead. With both players under pressure, van Gerwen missed five darts to win the tenth leg, before Cross hit a double 18 to force a sudden death leg. Both Cross and van Gerwen missed match darts at double 16 before Cross hit double 8 to qualify for the final in his debut entry, becoming the first player to make the final on his debut since Kirk Shepherd in 2008.\nIn the final, held on New Year's Day 2018, Phil Taylor won the bull-off, but opted to allow Cross to throw first. Rob Cross held the first set 3–1, and broke in the second set by the same scoreline, before winning the third set 3–0. Taylor scored his first set with a 3–0 win in the fourth, before missing a dart at double twelve for a potential perfect nine-dart leg in the first leg of the fifth set. \nCross won that leg and the next two to restore his three set lead, before breaking Taylor in the first leg of the sixth set, and the fourth leg of the seventh, taking a 6–1 lead in the best-of-thirteen match. \nTaylor held the eighth set 3–0, but Cross held the first leg in the ninth set, before hitting double-eight to break and go one leg away from the championship, and in the final leg, hit a 140 finish, treble-18, treble-18, double-16 to win the world championship.\nPreliminary round.\nThe draw was made on 26 November 2017.\nBest of three sets.\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the main round was made live on Sky Sports News on 27 November 2017. \nStatistics.\nTop averages.\nThis table shows the highest averages achieved by players throughout the tournament.\nRepresentation from different countries.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship, the total number including the preliminary round.

All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6–6 draw.\nWest Germans Edda Buding and Helga Niessen won the tournament by defeating French Rosa María Darmon and American Julie Heldman 6–3, 6–4 in the final. Americans Peaches Bartkowicz and Valerie Ziegenfuss won the third place.\nSeeds.\nBoth seeds received a bye into the semifinals."

        "title": "2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal",
        "text": "The 2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal involved National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules violations committed by the University of Louisville men's basketball program. The scandal centered around improper benefits given by former Director of Basketball Operations and Louisville player Andre McGee to prospective players and former Louisville players.\nKatina Powell.\nIn October 2015, Yahoo! Sports reported that the University of Louisville was investigating allegations made by Katina Powell, who described herself as a madam. Powell alleged that she had been paid several thousand dollars from 2010 to 2014 to provide women to dance for and have sex with Cardinals players and recruits. Many of the alleged parties took place at Minardi Hall, the men's basketball dormitory; others took place at off-campus locations. The allegations came out in advance of the release of \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen\", a book written by Powell and Indianapolis-based investigative journalist Dick Cady. In the book, Powell named Andre McGee, a former Cardinals assistant, and, in 2015, the team's director of operations, as having paid her for these services.\nAndre McGee.\nMcGee graduated from Canyon Springs High School in Moreno Valley, California, in 2005. That fall, he enrolled at Louisville, where he played for the Cardinals for four seasons. He helped the 2007–08 Cardinals reach the Elite Eight in the 2008 NCAA tournament. As the starting point guard during his senior year, he led the 2008–09 Cardinals to the Big East regular season and Big East tournament championships. The team earned the No. 1 overall seed in the 2009 NCAA tournament and again advanced to the Elite Eight. He played in 127 career games, including 57 starts, while averaging 5.2 points per game for the Cardinals.\nAfter his playing career at Louisville, McGee played briefly in the Basketball Bundesliga in Germany. He then served as a program assistant and Director of Basketball Operations under head coach Rick Pitino from 2010 to 2014. It was during this time that McGee committed NCAA violations by acquiring and paying for striptease dances and sexual acts for prospective players and players on his current roster. The violations occurred from December 2010 until June 2014.\nFindings.\nThe NCAA found Louisville head coach Pitino guilty of a Level I charge. NCAA bylaws 11.1.2.1 and 11.1.1.1 require the head coach to monitor all recruiting activities to ensure that they are complied with. Pitino failed to monitor that his director of basketball operations, McGee, complied with NCAA rules when Pitino gave McGee recruiting responsibilities.\nThe NCAA found that McGee engaged in unethical conduct and failed to cooperate when he refused to participate in interviews or provide relevant information to the enforcement staff during the investigation, which constituted violations of NCAA bylaws 10.01.1, 10.1, 19.2.3, and 10.1-(a).\nPenalties.\nPitino was set to be suspended for the first five games of the 2017–18 Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season, but Louisville fired him in October 2017, before the season started.\nThe program also had 123 wins from December 2010 to April 2014 vacated, including the 2012 Final Four and the 2013 national championship. The Cardinals were the first to have a men's basketball national title vacated by the NCAA. They also faced a monetary fine for revenue the university made from advertisements during the Final Fours and National Championship.\nThe university filed an appeal, but the NCAA upheld the findings and punishments on February 20, 2018.\nOn September 30, 2019, a group of players on the 2012–13 Cardinals team who were not involved in the rules violations settled a lawsuit they had filed against the NCAA. Most of the settlement was confidential, but one portion was authorized to be revealed—while Louisville's team records (including the national title) remained vacated, all honors and statistics for these players were restored. Most notably, Luke Hancock, a plaintiff in the suit, was once again officially recognized as the Most Outstanding Player of the 2013 Final Four."

After continuing west to Villeneuve-le-Roi, the peloton headed south-west to Villemoisson-sur-Orge and turned north-west. On reaching Longjumeau, the riders headed north to Montrouge, entered Paris at the Porte d'Orléans and turned west along the southern Boulevards of the Marshals. After crossing the Seine at the Pont du Garigliano, the race headed north along the Voie Georges-Pompidou, crossing back at the Pont des Invalides and quickly crossing for the final time at the Pont Alexandre III. After passing through the Grand Palais, the race then entered the Champs-Élysées. The riders then faced the circuit around the Tuileries Garden, through the Place de la Concorde and around the Arc de Triomphe. The race had an intermediate sprint after the third pass of the finish line, with the race ending after the ninth pass of the finish line. "

        "text": "The 2017–18 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round began on 27 June and ended on 23 August 2017. A total of 57 teams competed in the qualifying phase and play-off round to decide 10 of the 32 places in the group stage of the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League.\nAll times were CEST ().\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the qualifying phase and play-off round was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\nFormat.\nIn the qualifying phase and play-off round, each tie was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. If the aggregate score was level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time was played. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team advanced by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by penalty shoot-out.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their UEFA club coefficients at the beginning of the season, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided by draw. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. For these draws (or in any cases where the result of a tie in the previous round was not known at the time of the draw), the seeding was carried out under the assumption that the team with the higher coefficient of an undecided tie advanced to this round, which means if the team with the lower coefficient was to advance, it simply took the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association (or associations with political conflicts) were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nTeams.\nThere were two routes which the teams were separated into during qualifying:\nA total of 57 teams (42 in Champions Route, 15 in League Route) were involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round. The 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route) advanced to the group stage to join the 22 teams which entered in the group stage.

For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles:\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries.\nMoreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of four groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage. On each matchday, one set of four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other set of four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups alternating between each matchday.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw, using a computer draw not shown to public, with the following match sequence (Regulations Article 16.02):\n\"Note: Positions for scheduling did not use the seeding pots, e.g., Team 1 was not necessarily the team from Pot 1 in the draw.\"\nThere were certain scheduling restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g., Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general were not scheduled to play at home on the same matchday (to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams in certain countries (e.g., Russia and Azerbaijan) were not scheduled to play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather and simultaneous kick-off times).\nTeams.\nBelow were the participating teams (with their 2017 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included 22 teams which entered in this stage, and the 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route).\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format.

        "text": "The 2017 Sibiu Cycling Tour was a cycling stage race that took place between 5 and 9 July 2017 in and around Sibiu, Romania. Raced over , the race featured a traditional cobbled prologue along with mountain stages to Bâlea Lake and Păltiniș, and was held as part of the 2017 UCI Europe Tour.\nThe race was won by Colombian climber Egan Bernal, riding for the squad. Bernal took the race lead after winning the second stage of the race, the queen stage, to the summit finish at Bâlea Lake; he then further extended his lead by winning the following day to Păltiniș. Bernal ultimately won the race by 1 minute, 40 seconds ahead of rider Colin Stüssi, with the podium being completed by another rider, Valentin Baillifard, a further 35 seconds behind.\nBernal's performances were enough for him to win two other jerseys, winning the points and young rider classifications. In the race's other sub-classifications, Moritz Fußnegger from was the winner of the mountains classification, Damian Lüscher () was the winner of the sprints classification, while were the winners of the teams classification.\nTeams.\nInitially, 21 teams were invited to the race. The peloton featured three Professional Continental Teams, 17 Continental Teams and a Romanian national team, including for the first time, teams from North America.\nHowever, and did not compete, which left the starting peloton at 19 teams.\nRoute.\nThe race route was announced in December 2016.\nStages.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage covered of rolling terrain including 7 categorised climbs. After of the stage, two riders – Edwin Ávila () and Moritz Fußnegger () – broke away from the peloton building up at one stage a 6 minute advantage. With over of the race remaining Ávila attacked on his own and soloed to a stage win, holding off the chasing peloton who finished 43 seconds behind.\nStage 2.\nThe second stage of the race featured a route of including a final climb of on the Transfăgărășan to Bâlea Lake. The early part of the race featured a breakaway from which, with remaining, there was just one survivor – Nikodemus Holler of . Holler was eventually caught by the chasing group with to race.\nSoon afterwards, overall leader Edwin Ávila () was dropped by the small leading group and with remaining a pair of riders – Daniel Jaramillo () and Gabriel Reguero () – attacked. A counter-attack from Egan Bernal () saw him catch and then pass the two escapees, and he continued to build a lead over the chasing group. The other contenders were unable to respond and Bernal won the stage by over a minute.\nStage 3.\nAn early breakaway of five riders, including the leader of the mountains classification, Moritz Fußnegger () built up a lead of around 7 minutes. By the penultimate climb at Jina, the remainder of the breakaway had a 1' 30\" advantage over the chasing peloton, before being caught and passed by two attackers – Simon Pellaud () and Andrea Borso (). This pair in turn were caught by a small group of riders with remaining and from that group it was once more Egan Bernal () who attacked in the closing stages, and with the rest of the riders unable to respond, claimed his second successive stage victory, further extending his overall lead.\nClassification leadership table.\nIn the 2017 Sibiu Cycling Tour, six different jerseys were awarded. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on all stages with the exception of the time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a yellow jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the 2017 Sibiu Cycling Tour, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.\nThere was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either category SA, A, B or C, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The third jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1994 were eligible to be ranked in the classification.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a white jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage, and unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages (with the exception of the prologue) were awarded the same number of points. For winning a stage, a rider earned 25 points, with 20 for second, 16 for third, 14 for fourth, 12 for fifth, 10 for sixth with a point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th place. The fifth classification was the sprints classification, the leader of which was awarded a blue jersey. In the sprints classification, riders received points for finishing in the top three at intermediate sprint points during each stage – awarded on a 3–2–1 scale – and these intermediate sprints also offered bonus seconds towards the general classification as noted above.\nThe sixth and final jersey represented the classification for Romanian riders, marked by a red jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Romania were eligible to be ranked in the classification. There was also a team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team at the end of the race was the team with the lowest total time."

The tournament took on a similar format from the previous season, however, two teams from the Republic of Ireland's Airtricity League (Sligo Rovers and Bray Wanderers) entered the competition for the first time taking the total number of participating clubs to 56. This was the second season with two clubs from both Northern Ireland and Wales competing alongside the 30 members of the 2017–18 Scottish Championship, 2017–18 Scottish League One and 2017–18 Scottish League Two, four teams from the 2017–18 Highland Football League and four from the 2017–18 Lowland Football League as well as the Under-20 teams of the teams competing in the 2017–18 Scottish Premiership. The Welsh teams were The New Saints and Connah's Quay Nomads while the Northern Irish teams were Crusaders and Linfield.\nDundee United were the defending champions after they beat St Mirren 2–1 in the 2017 final, but were eliminated in the Quarter-finals by Crusaders.\nIrn Bru replaced Petrofac as the main sponsor of the competition in June 2016.\nFirst round.\nThe draw for the first round was made at 1 pm on 27 June 2017 at the Summerlee Industrial Museum in Coatbridge and was streamed live on the SPFL's Facebook page.

The draw was unseeded but the six non-Scottish teams were kept apart with one team from each country drawn at home and one away. Linfield were allocated an away tie due to the unavailability of Windsor Park so Crusaders played at home.\nTeams in \"Italics\" were not known at the time of the draw. Teams in Bold advanced to the third round.\nMatches.\nThe SPFL launched an investigation after two different methods of penalty shootout were used in the second round matches that required the tiebreaker. Montrose's 6–5 win over Ayr United used the traditional ABAB method where one team follows the other whereas The New Saints' 6–5 win over Livingston used the trial ABBA method where one team goes first before the other takes two consecutively and then the first team takes their second. SPFL rules state that the ABAB method should be used. The mix up is suspected to have come after confusion between the Irish referee and Welsh linesmen in The New Saints-Livingston match over which method was to be used. The result of the investigation is not expected to impact the result of The New Saints-Livingston tie.\nThird round.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the third round was made at 1 pm on 5 September 2017 at the Riverside Museum and was streamed live on the SPFL's Facebook page.

        "text": "Three cities submitted bids to host the 2018 Asian Games that were recognized by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). The games were awarded to Hanoi, Vietnam. The other shortlisted city was Surabaya, Indonesia. This came after Dubai and the United Arab Emirates pulled out of the running at the last minute during the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly meeting on November 8, 2012.\nAdditionally, the Games were originally scheduled for 2018, but during the Olympic Council of Asia's General Assembly meeting in Singapore on July 3, 2009, the committee decided to move the Games to the year before the 2020 Summer Olympics, which means that the 18th Asian Games will be held in 2019.\nHowever, on April 17, 2014, the Vietnamese Government announced it was withdrawing from hosting the Games.\nOn 19 September 2014, the Olympic Council of Asia executive board approved Indonesia as the host of the 2018 games. The Games were rescheduled from 2019 to 2018, since they will hold elections that year.\nFirst selection.\nHost city selection.\nThree cities: Hanoi, Surabaya and Dubai were shortlisted by the OCA as candidate to host the Games. They were inspected by an evaluation committee led by Vice President Lt Gen (R) Syed Arif Hasan who is also President of the Pakistan Olympic Association from 3 to 9 October. On November 8, 2012, the final selection was announced in Macau. With only two cities after Dubai withdrawal, Hanoi was selected as host by 29 votes to 14.\nConcerns and withdrawal.\nIn March 2014, lawmakers first raised concerns on whether US$150 million is a realistic budget for the Games, by referring to the amount spent by the previous host city, and claimed that the government may eventually spend over US$300 million. In addition, several stadiums built in conjunction with 2003 Southeast Asian Games were not utilised after the regional events. Former chairman of Vietnam Olympic Committee Ha Quang Du also added that hosting the Asian Games would not boost tourism in Vietnam.\nHowever, on April 11, 2014, Vuong Bich Thang, head of the General Department of Sports and Physical Training, assured that 80% of the facilities are available and US$150 million is enough to host the Games. He added that no new athletes' village would be built, but instead hotels, dormitories, and residential quarters would be provided for participating athletes and officials. The World Bank confirmed that there would be no loans for Vietnam for the purpose of building Asiad facilities.\nOn April 17, 2014, Vietnam Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung officially announced Hanoi's withdrawal from hosting the games. He cited unpreparedness and economic recession as the main reasons of the withdrawal, as they have left the country unable to afford the construction of facilities and venues. Statistics imply that the majority of Vietnamese are happy with this decision.\nThe OCA has announced that is no penalty will be imposed for the withdrawal.\nSecond selection.\nFollowing Hanoi's withdrawal from hosting of the Games due to the country's financial problems, the second round of bidding was announced on 19 September 2014.\nHost city selection.\nOn July 25, 2014, during the meeting in Kuwait City, the OCA has appointed Jakarta as host of the Games. Jakarta will be supported by Palembang as the supporting host. The Indonesian capital city was chosen because it has well-equipped sport facilities as well as adequate transportation networks, and other facilities such hotels and lodgings for guests. The Games however, was said to be rescheduled a year earlier, shifted from originally planned 2019 to 2018, citing that in 2019 Indonesians will be preoccupied by their Presidential election, and Jakarta would only need a relatively minimal times to upgrade and renovate their existing sports facilities. The last time Indonesia and Jakarta host the games was in 1962.\nPotential cities.\nThe OCA has said that Indonesia, China and the United Arab Emirates are candidates for the replacement of Hanoi. Several other countries were mentioned as potential replacements and some countries have been ruled out, as follows:"

        "text": "The Hartford Golf Club Historic District encompasses a golf course and adjacent residential neighborhood in West Hartford and Hartford, Connecticut. The area, developed between 1915 and 1936, includes the Hartford Golf Club, designed by Donald Ross, the area's oldest golf course, and a neighborhood with a high concentration of high quality Colonial and Tudor Revival houses. It is roughly bounded by Simsbury Road on the north, Bloomfield Avenue on the east, Albany Avenue to the south, and Mohegan Drive to the west. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\nDescription and history.\nThe Hartford Golf Club was founded in 1896, and immediately became a magnet for the social and business elite of Hartford. Its first golf course was built south of the present property, between Albany and Asylum Avenues. That course's thirteen-hole layout was problematic due to the terrain, and the club in 1914 purchased the southern portion of its present holdings. It hired Donald Ross to design the holes in this area, where fourteen holes were built. An eighteen-hole course was then made out of those plus four holes south of Albany Avenue. In 1945, the club purchased the northernmost portion of its land, which was developed with thirteen new holes, apparently also based on Donald Ross designs. The land south of Albany Avenue was sold in 1955.\nThe golf club's 1914 purchased kicked off a residential construction boom to its southwest. Over the next twenty years, a neighborhood of high quality Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival houses were built on large well-landscaped lots, and it came to be one of West Hartford's most fashionable neighborhoods of the period. Roads were laid out in large rectangles, and properties adjacent to the golf were the largest and most lavish in the neighborhood."

The rankings at the start of 2017/2018 season are determined by prize money earned in the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 seasons and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking status; the players are re-ranked at the beginning of the current season after removing players relegated at the end of the previous season from the ranking list. As points are accrued from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons earlier are dropped. The rankings are used to set the official tournament seedings at various points throughout the season; even though the rankings are officially updated after every tournament carrying ranking status not all the rankings are used as seedings, and only the rankings officially used as seedings are documented below. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2017/2018 season, all of the points from the 2016/2017 season, and the points from the 2015/2016 season that have not yet been dropped."

It was his record eighth Wimbledon men's singles title (surpassing Pete Sampras and William Renshaw's all-time record) and record-extending 19th major title overall. Federer also became the second man in the Open Era, after Björn Borg in 1976, to win Wimbledon without losing a set. This was Federer's 70th appearance at a major, tying the record for male players, and a record-breaking 11th men's singles final at the same major. In addition, with his third-round win over Mischa Zverev, Federer won his 317th major singles match, surpassing Serena Williams' Open Era record. With his first-round win, Federer surpassed Jimmy Connors' record for the most match wins at Wimbledon. In the same match, he hit his 10,000th career ace, becoming only the third man to do so. The tournament marked the fifth season where Rafael Nadal won the French Open and Federer won Wimbledon. \nAndy Murray was the defending champion and top seed, but was defeated by Sam Querrey in the quarterfinals – the second consecutive year in which Querrey beat the defending champion and world No. 1 at Wimbledon, after beating Novak Djokovic in the third round the previous year. Murray nonetheless retained the world No. 1 singles ranking, as Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka, and Djokovic failed to gain enough ranking points to surpass him. Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career grand slam, but lost to Daniil Medvedev in the first round. It was Medvedev's first victory in the main draw of a major championship.\nThis was also the first major since the 2009 French Open in which Murray, Nadal and Djokovic all failed to reach the semifinals, and the first time since 2004 that no player reached all four major quarterfinals in a year. With his win over Murray, Querrey became the first American man to reach a major semifinal since Andy Roddick at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships.\nFor the first time since the 2005 Australian Open, David Ferrer was unseeded at a major, and it was the first time since the 2004 US Open that Guillermo García López did not play at a major, ending his streak of 50 consecutive appearances. This was also the last major appearance for former world No. 2 Tommy Haas.

A right-handed batsman's front foot is the left; the back foot is the right. Typically, the conventional batsman will employ a front foot shot for deliveries of a fuller length (i.e., pitching closer to the batsman), and a back foot shot for deliveries of shorter length.\nBecause of the leverage the batsman can create with his or her feet, front foot shots usually result in the ball being played in front of the batsman, while back foot shots result in the ball being played behind the batsman's wicket. Many exceptions to this exist, however."

He also played on 17 occasions for Ireland.\nEarly life.\nAlexander Roulston Foster was born in Derry, Ireland 22 June 1890. He was the son of John Foster and Chrissie Bell Foster née Roulston. His father was a Relieving Officer originally from County Donegal from whence his mother also hailed. He had a number of siblings including older sister Mary Elizabeth and older brother Samuel Russell, and two younger sisters, Sarah Jane and Christina McClelland. He was educated at Queen's University Belfast.\nRugby career.\nFoster played rugby union as a centre and captained his university side, Queen's University RFC. He also played for City of Derry R.F.C. He was selected to play for Ireland in 1910, debuting at Twickenham against England on 12 February 1910. He went on to play against both Scotland and France in that first ever Five Nations championship and was later selected for the first official British Isles team that toured South Africa in 1910. In that tour he played in two of the tests. On his return to Five Nations rugby he played in every match of the 1911 and 1912 seasons but was absent for the 1913 championship. In 1914 he returned to play in three of the four matches for Ireland in the final championship before the First World War and was selected in the first championship after the war in 1921, playing his last match for Ireland on 12 March 1921 against Wales.\nCareer.\nFoster taught at Foyle College and coached its rugby side during what has been termed its great rugby era. The school, which had won the School's Cup in 1900, reached consecutive School's Cup finals in 1913 and 1914, losing in these finals to Campbell College and Methody (the Methodist College Belfast) respectively. However, a third final was reached in 1915 and on this occasion the school managed a 5–3 win over Royal School, Armagh. Over half of the trophy-winning team fought in the First World War. Foster soon left Foyle moving first to the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and later becoming headmaster of the Belfast Royal Academy, a position he held until 1942."

        "text": "Robert H. May (June 8, 1927 – July 20, 2014) was a Canadian ice hockey player and coach most well known for his brief tenure at North Dakota where he won the program's first National Champion in 1959.\nCareer.\nMay played for North Dakota for two seasons in the early 1950s and was named captain his final year. After graduating May turned to coaching, first leading Wayzata High School then Roosevelt High School before he was named as the bench boss for his alma mater. May was appointed coach of the Fighting Sioux when the university's president chose him instead of Ken Johannson, when the athletic directors were undecided.\nMay's first season brought incredible success as the Fighting Sioux won their first conference title and reached the 1958 NCAA Championship game. The WIHL was dissolved the following year, but that didn't stop May's team. They were once again invited to the tournament, bringing home the program's first national title.\nMay left the program to become the coach of the Minneapolis Millers for a year before he entered dental school. He became the team dentist for the Minnesota North Stars in 1968 and served in that capacity until 1983. In 1974 he became the coach of the newly formed Wayzata Checkers girls ice hockey team and led the team for its first seven seasons. In that time his team won a state title, three national titles and took first place in the 1979 Friendship Tournament held in Helsinki. Later in life he was brought back to Wayzata High School the second time to coach the first two seasons of the girls ice hockey team. He was able to help the squad to a conference championship in his second year.\nDr. Bob May served in the Army, reaching the rank of colonel. Over the course of his life May wrote four books, including; \"The Hockey Drill Book,\" \"The Hockey Road: From High School, to College, to Pro,\" and \"Girls Hockey in Minnesota; Where To Go From Here?\". May was twice inducted into the North Dakota Athletic Hall of Fame, in 1981 as an individual and in 2002 as part of the championship team. He was also a charter member of the MGHCA Hall of Fame in 2013.\nPersonal life.\nBob May died in 2014 at the age of 87 from pulmonary fibrosis. He was survived by his wife Beverley and their daughters Jan and Cathy."

        "text": "Cricketers who have debuted for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in first-class, List A or Twenty20 matches from 1978 are as follows.\nMCC have rarely taken part in List A matches (a total of seventeen between 1971 and 2020) or top-class Twenty20 matches (a total of five between 2018 and 2020). All the club's home matches have been played at its Lord's venue in London. The majority of MCC players in this period were contracted to county clubs and appeared for MCC by invitation. Some players were from other countries. The list includes players who took part in first-class matches for MCC on tour (e.g., to Bangladesh in 1999/2000). MCC teams have always operated at all levels of the sport and players who represented the club in minor cricket only are out of scope here.\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the span of years in which he was active as an MCC player in important matches (the span may include years in which he played only in minor matches for MCC and/or years in which he did not represent MCC in any matches) and then his name is given as it appears on match scorecards (e.g., surname preceded by all initials), followed by the club or team with which he was mostly associated (this may be MCC itself). Players who have taken part in Test cricket have their names highlighted in bold text and the names of players who represented MCC in a List A or Twenty20 match are preceded by the symbol."

        "title": "Brunswick Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Brunswick Cricket Club is based in Melbourne, Australia. The club was founded over 150 years ago and currently fields four senior men's teams in the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association along with a senior women's team, all abilities and numerous junior sides.\nHistory.\n1857–1900: Formation.\nBrunswick Cricket Club was conceived during a meeting at the Cumberland Arms Hotel on November 23, 1857, after an advertisement in the Argus newspaper asked for men interested in playing cricket. After playing informally against Yarra (Heidelberg), Williamson Alliance and Phoenix Park the club began formally in official competitions in 1901. Brunswick first played in the Victorian Junior Cricket Association at the club's first home ground on the east side of Sydney Rd, close to the Barkley Brick Company. Later Brunswick would relocate to the McAlister Oval, now the home of Parkville District Cricket Club. In 1907, the Brunswick Cricket Ground was constructed at a cost of £3,600, and the club was invited to join the VSDCA shortly afterwards in 1909/10. By 1914/15, the First and Second Elevens had won Brunswick's first VSDCA premierships. During these early years, John Curtin, Australian Prime Minister, played both cricket and football for Brunswick.\n1900-1950: Glory Years.\nIn 1909, the Brunswick Cricket Club joined the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association and eventually moved to A.G. Gillon Oval, which remains as the club's home ground today. From the early days Brunswick established a reputation as the powerhouse of the competition, remaining undefeated across two seasons in 1928/29 and 1929/30. The club went on to win six premierships in seven seasons from 1939/40 to 1945/46. Over these decades, William J. Dowling won the first eleven batting award fifteen times and the bowling award once. Bill was captain of the 1928/29 Premiership team, while other notable players during this period included former Australian Test players Bert Ironmonger and Morris Sievers. Ironmonger returned to Brunswick aged 51 and took 62 wickets at 9.53 in 1936/37. During his time as captain, Ironmonger oversaw the development of young wicketkeeper named Bill Jacobs. Jacobs would follow Brunswick players Morris Sievers and Roy Gardiner to play District Cricket with the Fitzroy Cricket Club in 1937. Jacobs played 266 consecutive matches for Fitzroy between 1937–38 and 1955–56, before moving into cricket administration. Bill served as a VCA Delegate from 1957-58 to 1968-69, as a State Selector from 1959-60 to 1971-72 (and 1982-83), and as Assistant Secretary of the VCA in 1973-74. Bill managed Australian teams to South Africa (1966–67) and the West Indies (1973), as well as managing the Rest of the World team in Australia (1971–72) at the request of the Australian Cricket Board. He was awarded Cricket Victoria life membership following his retirement as a delegate in 1969. Bill's son Ken Jacobs also played cricket for Brunswick. From 1980-2007 Ken was CEO of Cricket Victoria, in Melbourne Australia. In the year 2000 Ken was awarded the Australian Sports Medal by the Australian Government for his services to cricket.\n1950-2000: Return to the Top.\nFollowing the return of club legends John 'Nooky' Swanson and Tom O'Neil from Essendon CC in 1974, Brunswick again saw another golden period. Bill Hillhouse was appointed captain coach after captaining Carlton to a District Premiership in 1968/69. What was extraordinary about this was his team was undefeated for the entire season, the only time this has happened in Premier Crickets 100+ years of existence. Brunswick won back-to-back First XI VSDCA championships in 1975/76, 1976/77 before performing the premiership double again in 1980/81 and 1981/82.\nBrunswick's last First XI premiership came in the 1987/88 season and this side was captained by John Mulligan. The side finished fourth in the regular season before beating Malvern, Box Hill and Altona in the finals campaign. The Championship game against Altona saw club legend John Swanson sharing a decisive 143-run partnership with VSDCA games record holder and fellow Hall of Famer Geoff Turner, as Brunswick recovered from 4-75 to 5-218, Turner compiling 56 before Swanson went on to reach triple figures. However, Brunswick squandered a golden opportunity to post a total in excess of 300, losing 6-25 to be all out for 243. Altona's reply mirrored the Wicks’ innings, stumbling to 5-130 before a 78-run sixth-wicket stand put the championship within its reach. A run out changed the course of the contest before Mick Drinkall ripped through Altona's lower-order. The A's lost 5-20 and were skittled for 228, Drinkall finishing with 5-59 from 23.1 overs which included eight maidens.\nFrom 1975 to 1988, Brunswick won 12 premiership flags across all grades with club legend Blair Hillhouse captaining four first XI premierships.\nTeam of the Half-Century\nThe best Brunswick team from 1950-2000 was selected to celebrate the club's centenary in 2000.\n\"These players are listed below in alphabetical order.\" \n2000-present: Growing Women's Cricket.\nBrunswick formed its first independently run senior women's team in 2014/15.

        "title": "Mid-American Conference Men's Golf Championships",
        "text": "The Mid-American Conference men's golf championships is the conference championship tournament for men's golf in the Mid-American Conference, a Division I member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). All eight conference members qualify for the championship meet, which is played in stroke play format and held in three rounds over a three-day period in late April or early May. The winning team receives a regional berth to the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships. The tournament began in 1947 and is rotated to different courses each year, with the various conference members acting as host. Through the 2022 championship, Kent State has won the most conference titles with 28, followed by Ohio with 18.\nHistory and format.\nThe championship was organized in 1947, the first season of play for the conference after it had formed in late 1946. The initial championship, held in Detroit and won by the Wayne Tartans, had the original four conference members. For many years, the men's golf championship, along with the men's track and field championship and tennis championship, were rotated together amongst conference members as part of a two-day MAC \"sports carnival\" in late May. Beginning in 1973, the championship was held at two sites, with the opening rounds in one location and the concluding rounds at another. The location of the final rounds in one year would serve as the host for the opening rounds the following year. This format continued through 1978 and then returned to a single-site host in 1979.\nThe number of participating schools stood at nine in 2006 and was as high as 10 between 1977 and 1985 and again from 1998 through 2005. It was reduced to eight following the announcement in May 2020 that Akron was eliminating its men's golf team. Although the championship is no longer held in conjunction with the tennis and track and field championships, until 1993, the conference rotated the tournament to the home courses of each conference member. Since the 1994 championship, held at the Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio, the championship has rotated to neutral-site courses in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. After three years at Firestone, the tournament was held for two years at Quail Hollow Country Club in Concord, Ohio, and then began a four-year run at The Medallion Club in Westerville, Ohio from 1999 through 2002. After the 2003 championship was held at Rich Harvest Farms in Sugar Grove, Illinois, the tournament returned to The Medallion Club for two more years in 2004 and 2005. Since 2006, the tournament has been held at a different course each year in Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana. The Medallion Club hosted again in 2007 and Rich Harvest Farms in 2012, while courses such as Virtues Golf Club in Nashport, Ohio, and Brickyard Crossing in Indianapolis have also hosted multiple times. Virtues Golf Club, previously known as Longaberger Golf Club, hosted for the fourth time in 2017, followed by Sycamore Hills Golf Club in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2018, and Club Walden in Aurora, Ohio, in 2019.\nThe tournament has always used stroke play as its competition format, and was initially a two-round tournament through 1967, with a third round added in 1968. Since 1973 the tournament has been played over four rounds with few exceptions. The last tournament to include only three rounds was the 2012 championship, after the final round was canceled due to rain. The 2019 tournament was only two rounds after rain forced cancellation of the final two rounds. An individual conference champion is also determined by the tournament. If two or more golfers finish tied for medalist honors, they are all awarded. The exception for this was the 1980 and 1982 MAC Medalists where a playoff was held to break the tie. At the conclusion of the tournament, the MAC season awards are given out, including Coach of the Year, Golfer of the Year, Freshman of the Year, and the naming of All-MAC teams.\nBy school.\nOf the 12 full-time members of the MAC, eight schools compete in men's golf as of 2020. Central Michigan dropped men's golf after the 1985 season followed by Western Michigan in 1988 and Akron in 2020. Northern Illinois was the most recent addition to the championship, beginning play in 1998 after having previously competed in the MAC from 1975 through 1986.\n&lt;br&gt;\n – shared title"

        "title": "Lindenwood–Belleville Lynx women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Lindenwood–Belleville Lynx women's ice hockey team represented Lindenwood University – Belleville (LU–B or LU–Belleville) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in Women's Midwest College Hockey (WMCH), following a successful stint in the Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League (WWCHL). The team was founded for the 2014–15 season, as part of a rapid expansion of LU–B's athletic department, and quickly became one of the ACHA's top programs. The Lynx claimed three regular season conference championships and one playoff title (all in the WWCHL), and qualified for five ACHA National Tournaments, highlighted by a second-place finish in 2019.\nHistory.\n2014–15.\nLindenwood–Belleville announced the addition of women's (and men's) hockey on November 25, 2013, with the program scheduled to begin play during the 2014–15 season. The nearly-one-year lead time paid large dividends, as first coach and director of hockey operations Craig Buntenbach landed a gigantic 15-player freshman class that helped ensure the team's immediate competitiveness. The diverse inaugural group included future stars like Americans Ashley Dietmeier and Alexandra Brown, Canadians Blake Fuller, Maddy Millar and Jessica Moon, and New Zealand's Firth Bidois. Jaylene Anderson and Delaney Peters, both of whom came over from perennial ACHA Division 2 contender Rainy River Community College, provided an immediate veteran presence, while big Alaskan Alahna Stivers joined the roster late in the season.\nFor much of the year, things proceeded in a better-than-expected fashion for a first-year team, as the Lynx generally struggled against the ACHA's better teams but managed to reel off wins against most others. The first games in program history were 10–1 and 12–1 thrashings at defending national champion Miami, but LU–B recovered to sweep its first home games against Wisconsin at the Ice Zone the following weekend.\nThe Lynx entered the ACHA rankings for the first time in the November 23rd edition of the poll, checking in at 14th, a position the team would hold for the remainder of the season. Lindenwood–Belleville was 11–8–1 at the time of the ranking and were coming off of a pair of closer–than–expected losses to national title contender Adrian.\nBy late January, LU–B's record was 15–11–1, although four of the wins came against non-ACHA team Iowa, four others were over fellow first-year team Midland, and two more involved ACHA Division 2's Iowa State as the opponent. There wasn't a ton of indication as to what would come next: the Lynx collecting their first-ever signature victory, stunning No. 2 Liberty by a 2–1 count at the Ice Zone on January 30. Stivers (who was playing her first game with the team) answered an early goal by the Flames' Carrie Jickling on the power play, while Anderson buried the winner late in the third period on Dietmeier's assist. Bidois also starred, making 35 saves to negate a shot count of 36–8 in LU's favor.\nLU–Belleville finished the regular season well, winning three of four after the Liberty series, including arguably their second-biggest win of the year, over 12th-ranked Robert Morris (IL). The Lynx wound up third in the WWCHL standings behind Colorado State and Minnesota, an appropriate-enough position given their 0–4–0 record against the Rams and Gophers and their 10–0–0 mark against all other conference teams. That extreme stratification held in the WWCHL playoffs, held in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, where LU–B won a first-round game with Colorado but dropped a semifinal to Minnesota before recovering to close out the year with a third-place-game win over Wisconsin. The Colorado game was among the most dramatic wins in early team history, as Moon scored the 3–2 contest's winner with four seconds remaining. Millar assisted on the decider to cap a three-point outing, including a goal to tie things up midway through the third period.\nDietmeier (44 points) and Fuller (43) both ended the year among the ACHA's top ten scorers.\n2015–16.\nLindenwood–Belleville's second season started with a bang, as the team hired Katherine Hannah as its new head coach. Hannah, a native of Toronto, Ontario, is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of Lindenwood University's St. Charles, Missouri campus and ACHA women's hockey. She began her career with the Lindenwood Lady Lions ice hockey team as it was being established in 2003–04, playing through 2007–08. In her five seasons, she was the ACHA's Zoë M. Harris Player of the Year twice (one of only two players to win the award multiple times), a five-time All-American, helped the Lady Lions to the 2006 and 2008 ACHA national championships and rolled up a whopping 407 career points. She was a 2013 inductee to the Lindenwood Sports Hall of Fame, while a banner with her number 6 hangs in the Lions' home Lindenwood Ice Arena. Hannah had been coaching at Simsbury High School before making her way back to the Lindenwood system.\nHannah's tenure could not have started better, as the Lynx bolted out to an early 9–0–0 record and jumped from 14th in the rankings (LU–B began 2015–16 exactly where it closed 2014–15) all the way up to eighth - in position to receive an invitation to the ACHA National Tournament - by the end of October. The schedule stiffened from that point, but the squad acquitted itself well. In what could be characterized as the first truly pivotal series in program history, pitting teams battling for league titles and nationals bids against each other, the Lynx battled to a pair of come-from-ahead home ties with tenth-ranked Minnesota on November 7 and 8. Fuller and Stivers scored in each end of the series. A number of tight non-conference results followed to further bolster LU–B's ranking: 2–1 and 3–1 losses to No. 3 Adrian, a 3–2 loss to subsequent No. 3 Miami (in stark contrast to the first games in team history), and a 4–2 victory over No. 4 Grand Valley State on January 24, behind two Dietmeier goals and 47 Bidois saves.\nBack in the WWCHL, the Lynx found themselves as league frontrunners by late in the season, with the ties against Minnesota the only blemishes on their conference record. The Gophers, meanwhile, along with usual contenders Colorado and Colorado State, had all taken losses along the way. LU–B's shutout win over the Buffaloes on third-period goals by Stivers, Dietmeier and NCAA Division III transfer Hayley Winker at the end of January clinched the WWCHL regular season championship, the first conference title in program history.\nDespite entering the league playoffs in Boulder, Colorado as the top seed, the Lynx were instantly humbled by a staggering 7–0 loss to host Colorado to open things up. Fortunately for LU–B, a new pool-based playoff format offered a respite, and the team bounced back that evening to defeat Midland and advance to the semifinals. The standard airtight 60 minutes between the Lynx and Gophers followed, with LU–B getting the final word in the season series and holding on late for a 3–2 victory on the strength of goals by Winker, Fuller and Nikole Day. The redemption story was completed with a 2–1 championship game victory over the Buffaloes to win both the league title and an autobid to the ACHA National Tournament. The win largely owed itself to 36 saves by Bidois, who was named MVP of the playoffs, while Stivers and Katie Lakusta joined her on the first all-tournament team.\nAs the sixth seed entering nationals, Lindenwood–Belleville was thrown in a four-team pool with plenty of familiarity in the form of top-seeded Liberty and No. 3 Grand Valley State, with a new opponent, No. 8 Michigan, mixed in. However, the Lynx saw a quick end to their title hopes after dropping results to the Lakers and Flames. Despite the loss and elimination, the meeting with Liberty stood as one of the most exciting games of the tournament. The defending national champs took a 3–1 lead in the second period on a Jickling natural hat trick, but Winker and Fuller struck to get LU–B back even early in the third period. Liberty then took leads of 4–3 and 6–4, but a resilient Lynx squad had quick answers by Dietmeier and Haley Hill. The six-goal third period ended one shy on the LU–Belleville side though, as the Flames held on for a 6–5 win. The Lynx did manage to close out their time at the tourney on a high note, rallying from a 4–1 hole after one period to pick up a stirring 6–4 win over Michigan, the program's first ever at ACHAs.\n2016–17.\nWith 2015–16 marking Lindenwood–Belleville's transition from \"new\" to \"contender,\" the 2016–17 campaign presented its fair share of expectations, although its schedule proved difficult in more than one way. The Lynx went 9–5–2 over the first half of the season, a solid record made even more impressive by the fact that eight of the 16 contests came against No. 1 Miami, No. 7 Grand Valley State, No. 8 Colorado and No. 1 Liberty. While LU–B mostly struggled in those outings with a 1–5–2 record, the win was a huge one: a come-from-behind 4–2 result at Liberty on December 3, the Flames' first ACHA loss at their home LaHaye Ice Center since Rhode Island upended LU on November 16, 2014 (the unbeaten stretch spanned 20 games). Liberty jumped out to an early 2–0 lead, but the Lynx surged over the second and third periods behind goals from Stivers, Dietmeier, Fuller and Millar. That victory, combined with the closeness of the losses against top teams, allowed LU–B to remain sturdy in the rankings, as they never dropped below eighth during the year.\nOn February 18, 2017, the Lynx participated in USA Hockey's National Continuous Game, held in conjunction with the IIHF Girls' Global Game. The Girls' Global Game involved 44 national federations worldwide hosting one-hour games in succession over the weekend of February 17 through 19th, while the concurrent USA Hockey event spotlighted girls' and women's hockey at different levels on American soil. LU-B won their segment of the National Continuous Game by a 2–1 count at Minnesota on a pair of Fuller goals. The win, coupled with a victory against Wisconsin later that night, clinched LU–Belleville's second straight WWCHL regular season title.\nThe National Continuous Game was part of an extremely dense scheduling stretch linking the end of the regular season and the WWCHL playoffs, beginning with a three-game sweep of Colorado State from February 10 through 12th. The subsequent weekend in Minnesota included four games over three days with the Gophers and Badgers, while the playoffs also included four games in three days - a grand total of 11 games over 17 days between February 10 and 26. That reality, arguably, took its toll on the Lynx at playoffs, with a disappointing (in light of the three consecutive regular season or playoff titles to that point) third-place finish following a 5–1 loss to Colorado in the semifinals.\nNevertheless, in contrast to previous seasons, LU–B had built up enough status nationally to survive the blow and qualify for the ACHA National Tournament in Columbus, Ohio by finishing fifth in the rankings (three spots ahead of WWCHL playoff champion Minnesota, as things turned out) and drawing a pairing with No. 4 Massachusetts for a best-of-three quarterfinal, under a new tournament format. Things started well enough for the Lynx, as the Minutemen had to forfeit game one of the series thanks to Winter Storm Stella and related travel difficulties. UMass, however, showed up for games two and three both literally and figuratively, and managed to flip the series in their favor and advance to the semifinals with 7–3 and 4–2 wins. Alicia Williams, a freshman from Minnesota, scored twice at nationals, while Megan Lugar grabbed a second team all-tournament nod.\n2017–18.\nLU–B returned nearly its entire squad for 2017–18 and looked to build off of its successes in 2016–17 and its growing footprint in the ACHA picture. An 8–3–0 start (with two of the three losses to perennial contender Liberty) seemed to be a step in that direction, but an even bigger one came on November 17, 2017, when the Lynx beat two-time defending national champion Miami at Goggin Ice Center by a 3–1 score. Michelle Coonan made 33 saves to keep the potent RedHawks at bay, while Michaela Read both opened and closed the scoring, and Kate Tihema also added a third-period marker. The victory (even after settling for a split the next day) helped stabilize the Lynx as a top-eight team for the duration of the season. Three weeks later, the Lynx began an eight-game unbeaten steak that ran for a full two months, from December 8, 2017, through February 9, 2018. The last game of the stretch was a 4–3 victory over No. 2 Adrian. Tanya Candido (who would end up transferring to Adrian after the season) scored twice on the power play in the last 12 minutes of the third period to help LU–B rally from a 3–1 deficit before Fuller won it in overtime.\nEntering the WWCHL playoffs as co-favorites (after the conference moved to a divisional format), the Lynx looked the part through the pool stage of the tournament, defeating Arizona State 3–0 before a 13–1 demolition of hosting Midland that saw 14 different LU–Belleville skaters collect points, including hat tricks by Millar and Kate Tihema. However, for the second straight season, the Lynx were bounced from the conference semifinals by Colorado, as Maura Kieft's second-period power play goal provided the margin in a 2–1 contest.\nThe disappointment continued at the ACHA National Tournament when an LU–B team that seemed ready to take another step forward instead ended up in the same place as the year before, after they were quickly swept out of the quarterfinals by Miami.\n2018–19.\nChange came to the program in a few different ways during the 2018–19 season. It marked the departure of a massive senior class, many of whom had been the team's stars since its inception, including Fuller, Millar, Stivers, Winker, and Brown. Additionally, the Lynx left the WWCHL after four seasons and played the campaign as an independent team.\nThe new generation of Lynx was highlighted by an outstanding freshman class, including goalie Hannah Stone, blueliners Tessa O'Connor, Jessica Walker, and Mackenzie Drost, along with big center Dakota McAlpine. Sophomores like Read, Marissa Delry, and Lindsay Gillis took on an increasing role, while Dietmeier, Williams, Lugar, Katie Stelling, and Jamie Riselay remained to bridge the gap between the two groups.\nOn the way to a 19–4–3 regular season record, the Lynx achieved their highest ranking yet, jumping to the third position after a sweep of Massachusetts, Robert Morris, and McKendree to win the championship of the Robert Morris Showcase. Late in the season, they took down a top-ranked team for the second time in program history (following the 2016–17 win over Liberty) by beating Adrian, which had entered the game at 20–0–1. Gillis connected on the power play with just 3:33 remaining, and Stone's 23-save shutout did the rest in a 1–0 win.\nThe 2019 ACHA National Tournament in Frisco, Texas saw the Lynx finally break through the quarterfinal round for the first time, although it wasn't easy. Sixth-seeded Grand Valley State used 38 Lauren Allen saves to stun LU–B by a 4–3 count in the opening game of the best-of-three series, before the Lynx blasted the Lakers 10–2 in game two behind a five-point game from Gillis and four by Williams. The deciding contest then saw GVSU rally with two third-period goals to force overtime, but Dietmeier ended things quickly in the extra period to survive the upset bid and advance to the semifinals. The semifinal round, surprisingly, would prove less stressful, as LU–B jumped out to a 4–0 lead on second-seeded Adrian into the last ten minutes of the game before the Bulldogs found the net twice in the late going, one of those coming with 30 seconds remaining. Dietmeier, Gillis, and McAlpine starred in the game, with each scoring and adding at least one assist. LU–Belleville would fall one win short of the national championship though, as Liberty won their second straight title, 5–2.\nGillis, Dietmeier, and McAlpine were named to the first All-Tournament team, while Gillis and Stone were both first team All-Americans, in what would be LU–B's biggest ACHA postseason awards haul.\n2019–20.\nThe early part of the 2019 offseason brought the disastrous news of the cessation of Lindenwood–Belleville's athletic program due to Lindenwood's system-wide restructuring, making 2019–20 the Lynx's final season. To make matters worse, Hannah resigned in the aftermath of the decision, and Andrew Miller eventually took over to steer the team through the campaign.\nIf the Lynx could have been considered a lame duck, they hardly showed it through their play, as LU–B boasted a 28–6–0 overall record against one of the nation's toughest schedules. Lindenwood–Belleville, along with five other top programs (Liberty, McKendree, Midland, Minnesota, and Minot State), formed a new ACHA conference, Women's Midwest College Hockey (WMCH). All six WMCH teams would go on to finish in the ACHA's top ten, but the Lynx nevertheless managed a 12–2–0 record within the league. The obvious highlight of those games was a 2–1–0 mark against Liberty, the two-time defending national champions that had, of course, defeated LU–B in the 2019 title game. On September 29, 2019, the Lynx rallied for a split with the Flames with a 4–1 victory behind goals by Williams, Gillis, McAlpine, and Sydney Spicer. LU–Belleville also defeated Liberty on November 8, 2019, while defending their title at the Robert Morris Showcase in Chicago. LU–B also played six other games against teams that would finish in the top ten, going 3–3–0 in those contests.\nWhile the Lynx were largely led by the same core that came on board in 2016–17 and 2017–18, one key addition was Megan Norris, a rookie from Innisfil, Ontario. Norris scored 25 times (including a tear of 17 over her last 13 games) to finish second in ACHA Division 1 goal scoring, highlighted by a four-goal performance at WMCH playoffs to collect first team all-tournament honors. Veterans Williams and Gillis – the team's captains in 2019–20 – enjoyed their typically productive seasons and were both All-WMCH and All-American selections.\nLindenwood–Belleville hosted the inaugural WMCH playoffs at the FSI Shark Tank and opened up with a thorough 6–0 first round defeat of Midland, highlighted by a Norris hat trick. However, LU–B dropped from title contention the next day when Minot State took a 1–0 win in the semifinals, avenging a pair of early-season wins by the Lynx. The team did manage to bounce back to win the consolation game against McKendree, completing a perfect 6–0–0 record against their St. Louis-area rivals.\nDespite the disappointment of the WMCH loss, the Lynx easily qualified for the ACHA National Tournament for the fifth straight time and were set to take on sixth-seeded Michigan State in the quarterfinals until the COVID-19 pandemic forced the tournament's cancellation, leaving an ambiguous conclusion to the program's existence.\nSeason by season results.\n‡ The 2020 ACHA National Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nACHA National Tournament results.\nThe Lynx qualified for the ACHA National Tournament five times with a combined record of 5–8–0.\n‡ The 2020 ACHA National Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nProgram records.\nSource:\nACHA ranking history.\nThe top eight teams in the final ACHA ranking of the season receive an invitation to the ACHA National Tournament.

During the LU–B players' national team careers, both Australia and New Zealand have occupied either Division IIA or IIB, the fourth and fifth divisions under the IIHF system.\nAustralia has swung between those two divisions during Tihema's and Coonan's national team careers. In 2016, Australia won promotion to Division IIA through winning Division IIB. The victory came in dramatic fashion, as Australia dropped its opener to Mexico in a shootout, then recovered to win four straight, edging out Spain by a single point. Both players starred, with Tihema's four goals tied for seventh tournament-wide (two came in a victory over Spain, a crucial result given the standings margin), and Coonan ranking among the goaltending leaders with a 1.62 goals against average and a 0.886 save percentage. In 2020, Tihema was the team's alternate captain as it again won promotion, blowing through the field with a +35 goal differential over five games and only facing one serious challenge (a 2–1 win over Turkey in the second game, on February 24). She collected one goal and four assists during the run, including a player-of-the-game effort in the tournament-clinching win over rival New Zealand. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic-forced cancellations of most 2020 IIHF tournaments and the Division IIB tournament's unusually-early dates, Australia wound up as the winner of the highest IIHF division contested in 2020.\nAustralia has been on the other side of things too, however. During the first world championships for both Tihema and Coonan in 2014, Australia was relegated from Division IIA. The Aussies also finished sixth in Division IIA in 2017, immediately after the promotion success of 2016, but were fortunate to be spared relegation, as no teams were relegated during the 2017 and 2018 tournaments to allow the top division to expand from eight to ten teams. In 2018, Australia improved two places to fourth in Division IIA, the best overall finish of both players' senior national careers. Coonan started four of Australia's five games and was named the team's best player of the tournament by the participating coaches, while Tihema scored twice in the Mighty Jills' final game, a win over Slovenia in what was a de facto 4th/5th place contest. That success was followed by a disastrous 2019 tournament that saw Australia swept by the field and relegated back to Division IIB.\nTihema has scored 11 times, with seven assists, in 35 total games at worlds while Coonan has appeared in 22 contests.\nBidois was a member of New Zealand's 2015 world championships team that was relegated from Division IIA, notably forming a goaltending tandem with Grace Harrison, who joined St. Lawrence's NCAA Division I team that fall and became the first hockey player from New Zealand to earn an NCAA scholarship.\nWorld University Games.\nSince 2011, the ACHA has supplied players for the U.S. National University Select Women's Team, which competes at the World University Games women's hockey tournament, held biennially and as part of the multi-sport event for college and university student-athletes.\nLU–Belleville had two players selected for an evaluation camp in preparation for the 2017 edition of the team, Alex Brown and Ashley Dietmeier. Brown went on to make the final roster, and helped Team USA to the bronze medal, just the second won by any American team (men's or women's) in the modern era. The defenseman appeared in all four games during the tournament, and picked up a key assist of a Kendra Myers goal in a 3–2 win over Japan that allowed the U.S. to advance to the semifinals. Overall, Brown totaled four penalty minutes and a plus-1 rating.\nIn 2019, LU–B had three players selected for Team USA, including Hannah Stone, Katie Stelling, and Alicia Williams. While that version of the team was unable to repeat 2017's podium finish, losing in overtime to Japan in the bronze medal game, Stone was one of the tournament's best goaltenders. Most significantly, her 56-save effort helped hold heavily favored Canada to a 1–0 victory in the round robin stage of the tournament. Stone also logged 41 and 39-save efforts in two games against Japan, the latter effort coming in the third place game.\nWorld Deaf Ice Hockey Championships.\nIn April 2017, Lynx goalie Libbey Breaker competed for Team USA in the World Deaf Ice Hockey Championships (WDIHC) in Amherst, New York. The 2017 iteration of the WDIHC was the third edition of the tournament overall, but the first including women's teams. Breaker and the Americans played two games against Canada, dropping both by 6–4 and 6–3 scores. Despite the high-scoring nature of the contests, Breaker, Team USA's only goalie, was excellent in making 36 saves during the latter game to take her team's player of the game honors. She totaled 41 stops in the first match.\nOther tournaments.\nIn addition to their turns at the World Women's Championships, Coonan and Tihema have both represented Australia in other IIHF tournaments. Tihema played in the 2016 U18 World Championships, however her team did not fare well, losing all three of its group round contests. Tihema, for her part, scored twice against Great Britain (what would turn out to be the Mighty Jills' only tallies of the round robin) and was named Australia's player of the game. Australia did close things out on a high note, topping Romania in a shootout to take seventh place.\nBoth Tihema and Coonan participated in the 2014 Challenge Cup of Asia, although the Mighty Jills struggled that time out as well, dropping three pool games and then an overtime decision to South Korea for the bronze medal.\nRivalries.\nColorado.\nAlthough the rivalry ended after the Lynx left the WWCHL following the 2017–18 season, for most of the teams' shared time in the conference, Colorado was the biggest hurdle for LU–B.\nThe series had a rather tame beginning, as Lindenwood–Belleville won its first five times out against a rebuilding Colorado program. However, things heated up quickly beginning with the 2016 WWCHL playoffs, when Elle Dice scored twice and CU blasted LU–B 7–0 in the pool round opener for their first win ever against the Lynx. That result eventually helped set up a championship game rematch, with LU–Belleville getting revenge by a 2–1 count to win the program's first league playoff title. Colorado got more than its share of revenge, however. In 2016–17, the Buffs won in a rout (5–1) to eliminate the favored Lynx from the WWCHL semifinals, on the heels of the Buffs taking the regular season series with a win and a tie. Colorado also defeated LU–Belleville in the 2018 WWCHL semifinals by a 2–1 count, on the way to winning the league title. Renee Dreher and Maura Kieft scored the CU goals in what turned out to be the final game between the teams.\nThe Lynx won the all-time series 6–5–1, but Colorado took five of the last seven meetings, with one tie.\nMinnesota.\nBefore Colorado moved into contention, Lindenwood–Belleville and Minnesota were the WWCHL's two best programs. The two combined for every league playoff title and five of the six when including the regular season between 2014 and 2017, also sharing all four of the conference's ACHA National Tournament bids during that time.\nWhile the Lynx and Gophers never met directly for the conference title, they did split a pair of WWCHL semifinal meetings. In 2015, Jess Nkhata, Melissa Drown and Sonja Stojic all scored as Minnesota downed LU–B en route to an eventual title. The next year, the Lynx returned the favor with a 3–2 victory on the way to their own championship.\nBoth teams eventually left the WWCHL and joined WMCH for the 2019–20 season, where the Lynx swept the regular season series between the teams. In all, LU–B won the all-time series 7–4–3.\nLiberty.\nThe Flames were among the ACHA's best teams throughout the existence of the Lynx program, winning national championships in 2015, 2018, and 2019, but LU–B proved to be one of the few teams capable of consistently giving Liberty a hard time.\nThe signature game between the teams was the 2019 ACHA championship game, won 5–2 by Liberty to end LU–B's most successful title run one step short. The Flames also took their only other meeting with the Lynx at nationals, fending off an upset-minded LU–B team at the 2016 tournament, surviving an explosive third period in the process, by a 6–5 score.\nOn the other side, LU–B has earned two of the most important wins in program history against Liberty, including a 2–1 victory in the team's inaugural 2014–15 season that represented its first result that resonated across the ACHA. On December 3, 2016, the Lynx handed Liberty its first ACHA home loss in more than two calendar years. It was LU–Belleville's first-ever win over a top-ranked team and also helped ensure the squad's qualification for the 2017 ACHA National Tournament regardless of whether it secured the WWCHL's automatic bid. A revenge-minded Lynx team, following the 2019 national championship loss, closed the series by winning two of three from Liberty in 2019–20, after both teams joined WMCH.\nLiberty won the all-time series 9–4–1.\nMcKendree.\nMcKendree University established an ACHA Division 1 team for the 2016–17 season, with the Lebanon, Illinois-based school becoming LU–B's closest neighbor in the division by a wide margin (the campuses are roughly 12 miles apart, with Chicago, Illinois' Robert Morris (IL) previously holding the distinction at 300 miles away). The teams, despite their proximity, did not meet on the ice until the 2018–19 season, when the Lynx defeated the Bearcats 5–0 on November 11, 2018, to clinch the championship of the Robert Morris Showcase. Two Jessica Walker goals supported a Hannah Stone shutout in the victory.\nAfter that contest the teams became regular opponents, playing twice more in 2018–19 before becoming two of the six charter members of WMCH the following season. LU–B finished with a perfect 6–0–0 mark against McKendree, with the final meeting coming in the 2020 WMCH third-place game."

He starred at Wesley Chapel High School in Florida, where he was named the state Class A Player of the Year as a senior.

The team was led by third-year head coach Avery Johnson and played its home games at Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, Alabama as a member of the Southeastern Conference. They finished the season 20–16, 8–10 in SEC play to finish in a tie for ninth place. They defeated Texas A&amp;M and Auburn in the SEC tournament before losing in the semifinals to Kentucky.

They defeated Mississippi State and South Carolina to advance to the semifinals of the SEC tournament where they lost to Kentucky. They received an invitation to the National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to Richmond.\nSchedule and results.\nOn November 25, 2017, Alabama participated in one of the strangest moments of NCAA basketball history. During their game against #14 ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers, Alabama's bench players left the bench area during a scuffle with Minnesota's players midway through the second half, which resulted in Alabama's entire bench being ejected. Not long after the ejections, Dazon Ingram fouled out with 11:37 left in the game, which resulted in Alabama playing the rest of the game in a 4 vs. 5 manner. Not long afterwards, John Petty turned his ankle and could not return for the rest of the game, thus leaving Alabama with only three players with 10:41 left in the contest. From that point on Alabama was forced to play with only senior shooting guard/small forward Riley Norris, freshman power forward Galin Smith, and star freshman point guard Collin Sexton in a 3-on-5 setting throughout the rest of the game. While Minnesota was up by as many as 15 points during the undermanned portion of the game, Alabama would fight to cut the deficit to as few as 3 points due to Collin Sexton's leadership, which included a 40 point game from him. However, the Golden Gophers would ultimately hold on to win 89–84 over the shorthanded Crimson Tide. Despite losing, Alabama would improve their rank to #24 due to their performance while undermanned and nearly upsetting Minnesota that night. The game would be described as one of the strangest in college basketball history.\n!colspan=12 style=|Canadian Foreign Tour\n!colspan=12 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=| NCAA Tournament"

        "text": "The cover drive in cricket is the act of stroking the ball through the covers with well-timed wristwork and conventional movement of the front foot toward the pitch of a delivery aimed at or outside the off stump.\nThe cover drive is considered one of the most graceful shots playable in the sport. Batsmen able to master the cover drive are usually given especially high praise because of the shot's difficulty in execution and its requirement for exquisite timing. When played to perfection, the cover drive comprises a batsman's seemingly effortless wielding of the blade in a downward trajectory through the off side, with the cricket ball gliding through infielders in the covers at pace toward the boundary at deep cover.\nThe stroke has historically been associated with parlimantry play of the sport, particularly during the Golden Age of Cricket in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when England still distinguished between amateurs and professionals. During this era, amateurs, or aristocratic cricketers, some of whom played for the Gentlemen, prided themselves on proper, conventional off-side play, including the front-foot cover drive. Professionals, or working-class cricketers, some of whom played for the Players, were better-known for workmanlike shots through the leg side, including flicks around the wicket.\nIan Bell, Kumar Sangakkara, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Babar Azam, Rahul Dravid, Meg Lanning and Laura Wolvaardt are members of a select group of players who are widely considered as 'masters' of the shot with England’s Walter Hammond widely considered as having the finest cover drive ever."

As the winners of the 2017–18 EuroCup Basketball, Darüşşafaka qualified for the European top-tier level 2018–19 EuroLeague season.\nFormat changes.\nFor the 2017–18 season, the EuroCup went back to the initial format for the 2016–17 season which includes 24 teams playing in four regular season groups, with 16 teams advancing to the Top 16 phase, featuring four groups of four teams each. Eight teams will qualify for best-of-three quarterfinals, which will be followed by best-of-three semifinals and best-of-three finals.\nTeam allocation.\nA total of 24 teams from 12 countries participated in the 2017–18 EuroCup Basketball.\nDistribution.\nThe table below shows the default access list.\nTeams.\nThe labels in the parentheses show how each team qualified for the place of its starting round:\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 6 July 2017, 13:30 CEST, at the Mediapro Auditorium in Barcelona. The 24 teams were drawn into four groups of six, with the restriction that teams from the same country could not be drawn against each other. For this purpose, Adriatic League worked as only one country. For the draw, the teams were seeded into six pots, in accordance with the Club Ranking, based on their performance in European competitions during a three-year period and the lowest possible position that any club from that league can occupy in the draw is calculated by adding the results of the worst performing team from each league.\nRegular season.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners, runners-up, third-placed teams and fourth-placed teams advanced to the Top 16, while the fifth-placed teams and sixth-placed teams were eliminated. The rounds were on 10–11 October, 17–18 October, 24–25 October, 31 October–1 November, 7–8 November, 14–15 November, 5–6 December, 12–13 December, 19–20 December and 26–27 December 2017.\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTop 16.\nIn each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the Playoffs, while the third-placed teams and fourth-placed teams were eliminated. The rounds were on 2–3 January, 9–10 January, 16–17 January, 23–24 January, 30–31 January and 6–7 February 2018.\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPlayoffs.\nIn the playoffs, teams played against each other must win two games to win the series. Thus, if one team wins two games before all three games have been played, the game that remains is omitted. The team that finished in the higher Top 16 place will play the first and the third (if it is necessary) legs of the series at home. The playoffs involves the eight teams which qualified as winners and runners-up of each of the four groups in the Top 16."

When it was introduced in 1999 the Bowl initially replaced the Plate competition, which was itself re-instated several years later for the 2003–04 season.\nThe Hampshire Bowl is currently open to club sides based in Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands, who play between tier 8 (London 3 South West) and tier 9 (Hampshire Premier) of the English rugby union league system, although sometimes teams from outside the league structure are invited to take part. The format is a knockout cup with a preliminary round, quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final to be held at the home ground of one of the finalists between March–May."

However, Ridge shanked the kick and the scores remained 20–all at the end of regulation time.

Previously, this event was held at an interval start. It was also the first cross-country event in Salt Lake City, starting shortly before the men raced 30 km. The 2001 World Champion was Bente Skari of Norway elected not to contest this race, even though she had been the dominant female cross-country racer over the past five years.\nThe early leader in the race was Russian Yuliya Chepalova, but by 9 km, Italy's Stefania Belmondo, the 1999 World Champion in the event, moved ahead, until her pole broke at 10.5 km. She dropped back to 10th place, but trailed the leader, Larisa Lazutina, by only 10 seconds. Belmondo was given a pole by a French official but it was very long, so she struggled for over 500 metres until an Italian coach gave her one of her own poles. She then powered ahead, caught Lazutina and won a narrow victory by 1.8 seconds. Behind them, Czech skier Katerina Neumannová came in for the bronze medal. But Lazutina would not keep her silver medal. After the pursuit race, held six days later, she was found to have tested positive for darpopoietin, an erythropoietin analogue, and was disqualified in late 2003. Neumannová was moved up to silver medal, and Chepalova would get the bronze. Chepalova failed drug tests later in her career, but here Olympic results were left unaffected.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 09:00."

Her teammate, Olga Danilova, who had originally finished eighth had been sanctioned for doping two months earlier and was also disqualified. This brought Paruzzi up to gold medal, her first individual olympic medal.

He was selected 13th overall by the Marlins in the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, and made his MLB debut in 2020.\nAmateur career.\nRogers attended Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, New Mexico. As a junior, he was 9–2 with a 0.70 earned run average (ERA) and 122 strikeouts and helped lead his team to victory in the 6A state championship game.\nRogers committed to Texas Tech University to play college baseball. Considered one of the top prospects for the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, the Miami Marlins selected him with the 13th overall selection. Rogers signed with Miami for $3.4 million.\nProfessional career.\nMinor leagues.\nRogers made his professional debut in 2018 with the Greensboro Grasshoppers and spent the entire season there, pitching to a 2–7 record with a 5.82 ERA over 17 starts. He began 2019 with the Jupiter Hammerheads with whom he was named a Florida State League All-Star. He was promoted to the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp in August. Over 23 starts between both clubs, Rogers went 6–10 with a 2.90 ERA, striking out 150 batters over innings.\nMajor leagues.\nOn August 25, 2020, Rogers was selected to the active roster. He started against the New York Mets, pitching four scoreless innings and allowing one hit. He made seven starts in 2020, going 1–2 with a 6.11 ERA with 39 strikeouts over 28 innings.\nRogers began 2021 as a member of Miami's starting rotation. He was named the NL Rookie of the Month Award back-to-back for the months of April and May 2021. He opened the season with a 3-1 record and a 1.29 ERA in five starts with thirty-eight strikeouts over twenty-eight innings in April. He followed that strong performance again in May with a 3-2 record and a 2.34 ERA in six starts, striking out thirty-eight batters. He was the first Marlins player to win Rookie of the Month honors since Justin Bour in September 2015 and the first Marlins pitcher to win it since José Fernández in July 2013. In July of that year, Rogers was named to the All-Star Game as the Marlins' sole representative. He finished the 2021 record with a 2.64 ERA and 157 strikeouts over 133 innings in 25 starts, despite a 7–8 record. He finished second in NL Rookie of the Year voting behind Jonathan India.\nIn 2022, Rogers had a down year in retrospect to his rookie campaign. In 23 starts, he registered a 4–11 record and 5.47 ERA with 106 strikeouts in 107.0 innings pitched. His sophomore season ended prematurely after he was placed on the injured list with a left lat strain on September 22.\nRogers began the 2023 season out of the rotation with Miami, logging a 1–2 record in 4 starts. In an April 19 start against the San Francisco Giants, Rogers was removed from the outing with an injury, later revealed to be a left biceps strain. He began a rehab assignment with the Single–A Jupiter Hammerheads on May 30. However, after Rogers was scratched from a scheduled start on June 10, he was transferred to the 60-day injured list three days later.\nPersonal life.\nHis cousin, Cody Ross, played in Major League Baseball."

        "text": "The New Zealand mole cricket (Triamescaptor aotea) is a wingless member of the mole cricket family Gryllotalpidae. Endemic to New Zealand, it lives underground and is rarely seen. It is now restricted to parts of the southern North Island.\nTaxonomy.\nThe mole cricket was well known to Māori, who encountered it when cultivating garden plots and called it honi. Mole crickets collected in New Zealand were assumed to be the European species \"Gryllotalpa vulgaris\" (a synonym of \"Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa\"), which has a wingless nymph that resembles the adult New Zealand species. \"Triamescaptor aotea\" was named and described by Norman Tindale in 1928 from two specimens collected in 1915 at Aramoho, Whanganui. It is the only species in its genus, and the only genus in tribe Triamescaptorini. Its closest relatives are two Australian species of \"Gryllotalpa\". \"Triamescaptor\" is sometimes incorrectly spelled \"Trimescaptor\" in later publications.\nDescription.\n\"Triamescaptor aotea\" is long, and medium to dark brown in colour, with distinct protruding antennae and long rear processes (or cerci). Its rear cerci are sensory, and in its tunnel it is able to move backwards as easily as forwards. The first segment of its thorax is extended, rounded, and armoured. Its front legs are heavily modified for digging, flattened and shovel-like, with just three claw-like processes or dactyls on its tibia (\"Gryllotalpa\" has four), two movable and one fixed.\nThe New Zealand mole cricket, unlike other species of Gryllotalpidae, has no wings, not even vestiges. Because mole crickets produce sound by stridulation of their wings, this species is necessarily silent and lacks the ears other species have on their front tibia. Any winged mole crickets found in New Zealand are likely to be introduced European \"Gryllotalpa\", with which the New Zealand species has sometimes been confused.\nEcology.\nNew Zealand mole crickets live underground, in circular galleries roughly in diameter and below the surface. Females lay clutches of eggs in side chambers off the gallery and guard them until they hatch. They are omnivorous, feeding on the roots of plants and other burrowing insects such as grass grubs (\"Costelytra zealandica\") and porina moth caterpillars (\"Wiseana\"). During rain or flooding mole crickets emerge from their burrows to feed; they have been recovered from the stomachs of eels at Lake Pounui in the Wairarapa, which forage in flooded paddocks at night.\nDistribution.\nBecause it lives underground this species is vulnerable to agricultural cultivation. Formerly widespread, it now seems to be localised to parts of the lower North Island, including Hawke's Bay, Whanganui, near Levin, Lake Wairarapa and Lake Pounui, and on D'Urville Island. It is probably also eaten by introduced rats. The Department of Conservation considers the species at risk because it is naturally uncommon."

        "text": "The 2019 Tour de France was the 106th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. The -long race consisted of 21 stages, starting in the Belgian capital of Brussels on 6 July, before moving throughout France and concluding on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 28 July. A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won for the first time by a Latin American rider, Egan Bernal of . His teammate and 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas finished second while Steven Kruijswijk () came in third.\nKruijswijk's teammate Mike Teunissen won stage 1's bunch sprint to take the first yellow jersey of the Tour. Julian Alaphilippe of took the lead of the race following his victory of stage 3. He lost the yellow jersey after the sixth stage to Giulio Ciccone () who was the highest placed rider of a breakaway group that finished ahead of the peloton (main group). Ciccone's lead of the Tour lasted two stages, before Alaphilippe retook it after stage 8. Against expectations, he held the yellow jersey for the next eleven stages, including the Pyrenees, before losing it to Bernal on the second day in the Alps, stage 19, which was shortened by inclement weather. Bernal held his lead in the final two stages to win the Tour.\nThe points classification was won by 's Peter Sagan for a record seventh time, with Romain Bardet of winning the mountains classification. Bernal also won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by and Alaphilippe was named the overall most combative rider. Caleb Ewan of won the most stages, with three.\nTeams.\nThe 2019 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams. The race was the 27th of the 38 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its 18 UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. Additionally, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organisers of the Tour, invited four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams to participate in the event. The three French and one Belgian teams had each participated in the race before. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place in front of a crowd of 75,000 on the Grand-Place square in Brussels, Belgium, on 4 July, two days before the opening stage.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of eight riders, resulting in a start list total of 176. Of these, 33 competed in their first Tour de France. The riders came from 30 countries. Six countries had more than ten riders in the race: France (43), Belgium (21), Italy (15), Spain (13), Germany (11) and the Netherlands (11). The average age of riders in the race was 29.71 years, ranging from the 21-year-old Jasper Philipsen () to the 39-year-old Lars Bak (). had the youngest average age while had the oldest.\nThe teams participating in the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nPre-race predictions in the media, as well as the bookmakers, on the general classification were drastically altered when four-time Tour winner Chris Froome () was ruled out with multiple injuries following his crash at the Critérium du Dauphiné three weeks before the Tour. Although he was third overall behind teammate and winner Geraint Thomas in the previous year's Tour, Froome was considered the 2019 Tour favourite before his crash. Prior to Froome's withdrawal, there was no official announcement by on leadership for the Tour, which could have potentially been shared between himself, Thomas and Egan Bernal. Another major absentee was the 2018 Tour runner-up Tom Dumoulin (), who missed the Tour with a knee injury he picked up at the Giro d'Italia, the Grand Tour of Italy that took place a month before the Tour de France, and a race he won in 2017. With their absence, the Tour was expected to be a more open race, with Thomas and Bernal as the leading contenders. Their closest rivals were thought to be Romain Bardet (), Jakob Fuglsang (), Steven Kruijswijk (), Mikel Landa (), Vincenzo Nibali (), Thibaut Pinot (), Nairo Quintana () and Adam Yates ().\nAfter celebrating his 2018 Tour victory, Thomas was overweight at the start of the 2019 season. His only result of note before the Tour was a third-place overall finish at the Tour de Romandie in early May. In June he abandoned the Tour de Suisse following a crash, and required recovery time, which put his ability to perform at the Tour in doubt. Bernal made his Tour debut in 2018 riding as a domestique (leader's assistant) for Froome and Thomas, who are ten years his senior. In the 2019 season, he was planned to lead his team's Giro squad, but missed the race after he broke his collarbone. His major wins of the season up to the Tour were the Paris–Nice stage race before his injury and the Tour de Suisse on his return. In the Tour, he was to share the leadership with Thomas according to the team, although some in the media expected an internal battle between the two.\nBardet had finished on the podium twice in his career, second in 2016 and third in 2017. His form was lacking in the build up to the Tour, although his experience and the consistency of his previous performances in the race were considered enough to make him a serious contender. Fuglsang was the most in-form contender, enjoying a successful spring classics campaign, including victory in the prestigious \"monument\" one-day race Liège–Bastogne–Liège as well as the stage races Vuelta a Andalucía and the Dauphiné. Fuglsang was thought likely to benefit from a strong team, but doubt was cast on his ability to perform over a three-week Grand Tour, as he had never finished in the top three places in a Grand Tour. That too was the case with Kruijswijk, who had performed well in the season and was considered a top contender, despite suffering with illness leading up to the Tour. Landa's form was considered harder to predict, as he had stayed away from racing after the Giro, where he just missed out on a podium place. His best overall result in the Tour so far had been in 2017, when he finished fourth riding as a domestique to Froome.\nVeteran rider Nibali had no wins so far in 2019, but placed second overall at the Giro and was considered to be a danger due to his experience. He was the only rider on the start list apart from Thomas to have won a Tour, the 2014 edition. Pinot was also considered to be in form after finishing fifth overall in the Dauphiné, and before that, winning the general classification of the non-World Tour Tour de l'Ain and Tour du Haut Var. It was however speculated that the pressure of being a home favourite could affect him negatively, as well having issues with heat. His previous results in the Tour had been mixed: he had finished third in 2014, but had dropped out of the race twice since then. Quintana, a two-time Grand Tour winner, was seen as a podium contender. Yates returned to the race after finishing 29th overall the previous year. Although he withdrew from the Dauphiné a few weeks earlier for illness, he had been in good form before then.\nOther riders expected to place high in the general classification were Emanuel Buchmann (), Dan Martin (), Enric Mas (), Richie Porte (), Rigoberto Urán and Tejay van Garderen (both ), Alejandro Valverde () and Ilnur Zakarin ().\nThe 2018 winner of the points classification, Peter Sagan (), returned to defend his title in an attempt to break Erik Zabel's record of six wins. Before the Tour he shared the record with Zabel, after winning the classification in six out of the past seven editions. Sagan was regarded as the clear favourite for winning the points classification. The riders thought to be Sagan's biggest rivals were Caleb Ewan (), Dylan Groenewegen (), Michael Matthews () and Elia Viviani (). Other contenders for the green jersey were Julian Alaphilippe (), Edvald Boasson Hagen (), Alexander Kristoff () and Wout van Aert ().\nRoute and stages.\nOn 30 May 2017, the ASO announced that Brussels would host the 2019 edition's opening stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"), honouring one of the Tour's most successful riders, Belgian Eddy Merckx, on the 50th anniversary of his first of five overall victories. It was the second time the \"Grand Départ\" had taken place in Brussels and was the fifth Belgian \"Grand Départ\". It also marked 100 years since the race leader's yellow jersey was first seen at a Tour. Further details of the \"Grand Départ\" were revealed on 16 January 2018: the opening stage that featured the Muur van Geraardsbergen climb, an iconic steep cobbled climb of the Tour of Flanders \"monument\" race, and a second stage team time trial around the streets of Brussels. The entire route, which the race director Christian Prudhomme described as \"the highest Tour in history\", was unveiled on 25 October 2018.\nThe opening stage visited Charleroi and looped back to Brussels, to connect the regions of Flanders and Wallonia in a stage. Starting in Binche, the third stage left Belgium for France, with the following stage taking the race to the north-east to the Vosges Mountains for two further stages. The transitional stage 7 moved the Tour south-west and towards the Massif Central highland region, with stage 8 ending in the city of Saint-Étienne. Stages 9 and 10 traversed the Massif Central, before the Tour's first rest day. The following two stages moved the race to the Pyrenees, which hosted four stages. After the second rest day, the Tour took a long transfer east for stage 16, finishing in Nîmes. Stage 17 took the race up to the Alps at Gap. After three Alpine stages, an air transfer moved the Tour to the outskirts of Paris, ending with the Champs-Élysées stage.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of . There were two time trial events, stage 2's team time trial and stage 13's individual time trial. Of the remaining nineteen stages, seven were officially classified as flat, five as hilly and seven as mountainous. The longest mass-start stage was stage 7, at , and the shortest was stage 14, at . The route contained five mountain-top finishes: stage 6, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stages 14, to the Col du Tourmalet; stage 15, to Foix; stage 19, to Col de l'Iseran; and stage 20, to Val Thorens. The Iseran mountain pass, the highest paved pass in Europe, featured on stage 19. This was the seventh time that the Tour climbed the Iseran, but only the second ascent from the more difficult southern side. It was among five \"hors catégorie\" (beyond category) rated climbs in the race. Of the 34 stage start or finish hosts, the race visited Binche, Saint-Dié-des-Vosges and Pont du Gard for the first time.\nRace overview.\nFirst week: Belgium, north-eastern to southern France.\nStage 1's bunch sprint finish was won by 's Mike Teunissen. He was initially a member of the team's sprint train who were leading out their designated sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, but following Groenewegen's crash in the closing , Teunissen was free to race in the sprint. He took the first yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Early in the stage, Greg Van Avermaet () led the breakaway group over the highest categorised climb of the stage, the third-category Muur van Geraardsbergen, claiming the lead in the mountains classification and the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the classification.\nTeunissen increased his overall lead in the race following his team's victory in stage 2's team time trial, finishing twenty seconds ahead of second-placed . However, his hold on the yellow jersey was short lived after the following day's hilly stage when he lost the race lead to Julian Alaphilippe, who launched a solo attack with to go over the final climb, the third-category Côte de Mutigny, catching and passing the remainder of the breakaway to win the stage. Peter Sagan and Tim Wellens () took the green and polka dot jerseys respectively. The following day's flat stage ended in a bunch sprint won by Elia Viviani.\nThe climbs of stage 5 did not cause trouble to the race, as most of the stage contenders retained their energy for the following stage's steep finish of the first-category Planche des Belles Filles climb. An early four-man breakaway, which included mountains classification leader Wellens, was caught well before the sprint bunch finish, won by Sagan. The mountainous stage 6 saw a 14-strong breakaway gain a lead of more than 8 minutes. By the second-category Col des Chevrères, only four riders remained. Wellens and Xandro Meurisse (), the former having secured his polka dot jersey for another day, were distanced on the final climb by Dylan Teuns () and Giulio Ciccone (). Teuns went on to win the stage, and despite Ciccone fading before Teuns in the final metres of the climb he managed to take over the yellow jersey, as the strongest of the peloton (main group) came in over one and a half minutes behind, with former leader Alaphilippe standing six seconds down in second place. The final also proved to be a difficulty for general classification contenders Vincenzo Nibali, Richie Porte and Romain Bardet, who lost time on the climb.\nStage 7, returning to the flat after the Vosges Mountains, was uneventful, with the breakaway being held by the peloton to only a few minutes, and despite early crashes by Tejay van Garderen and Teunissen, ended in a technical bunch sprint won by Groenewegen. The Tour began its traverse of the Massif Central with stage 8; with close to of elevation gain, it was seen before the race as a potential win from a breakaway, which on the day had four riders. As the successive climbs were passed, this number was gradually reduced, with only Thomas De Gendt () and Alessandro De Marchi () surviving until the final climb, on which De Gendt successfully distanced him. With the breakaway duo's advantage down to under a minute in the final kilometres, Alaphilippe and Thibault Pinot attacked and gained twenty seconds on the much reduced peloton, as De Gendt managed to hold on for the stage victory, with Alaphilippe regaining his yellow jersey. Defending champion Geraint Thomas survived his second crash in this edition of the Tour.\nStage 9 saw an early 15-strong breakaway form, which the peloton let go. At the to go mark, Lukas Pöstlberger of escaped the breakaway until from the finish on the final climb of the third-category Côte de Saint-Just. Following this, a leading trio emerged, consisting of Nicolas Roche (), Tiesj Benoot () and Daryl Impey (). Roche was dropped before the finish, leaving the victory to Impey who overcame Benoot in the final sprint, in a day which otherwise saw no significant changes in the overall standings.\nThe tenth stage was on relatively flat terrain. With remaining, splits occurred in the peloton as and others took to the front and broke the field apart in strong crosswinds. This effort proved decisive, as several overall contenders who were caught behind, including Pinot, Richie Porte, Rigoberto Urán, Jakob Fuglsang and Mikel Landa, lost time on the front group. Thomas, Egan Bernal, Alaphilippe and Bardet maintained their position at the front of the race, amongst a reduced bunch. The victory went to Wout van Aert, as several of the main sprinters were caught behind, including his teammate Groenewegen.\nBy the first rest day, which was a day later than usual, the general classification was led by Alaphilippe, who had a lead of 1' 12\" on Thomas, behind whom was Bernal in third place, just 4\" from Thomas. Home favourite Pinot, despite being 1' 21\" back from Thomas in eleventh place, was considered by his directeur sportif Marc Madiot to still be in contention. In the points classification, pre-race favourite Sagan was in first position, already 62 points ahead of second-placed Michael Matthews. The mountains classification was more closely contested, with breakaway riders and teammates Wellens and De Gendt respectively first and second, with a gap of six points.\nSecond week: Southern France and Pyrenees.\nStage 11's small breakaway was caught with remaining, before Caleb Ewan won the bunch sprint finish. The first Pyrenean stage, the twelfth, saw a 42-rider breakaway reduce to a group of Simon Yates (), Pello Bilbao () and Gregor Mühlberger () on the final climb of La Hourquette d'Ancizan, the second of the stage's two first-category climbs. The trio descended to the finish at Bagnères-de-Bigorre, where Yates won the sprint. The majority of the peloton came in close to ten minutes after. A notable abandonment of the stage, for personal reasons, was the reigning world time trial champion Rohan Dennis (), a favourite for the following day's time trial.\nIn the aforementioned stage, Alaphilippe took the victory, with a time of 35' 00\" across the course, achieving a victory on a day where he was expected to lose time to riders such as Thomas, who ended up in second place, fourteen seconds down. Wout van Aert, one of the favourites for the stage, had to abandon the race during the time trial after he crashed, having clipped a barrier on the side of the road.\nOn stage 14, the last of the breakaway riders were caught by the leading group of general classification contenders at before the finish atop the \"hors catégorie\" Col du Tourmalet. With remaining, Thomas got detached from the lead group containing Alaphilippe, Emanuel Buchmann, Pinot, Bernal, Landa and Steven Kruijswijk. Pinot attacked in the final and held his lead to the finish line at the summit.\nOn the final stage in the Pyrenees, Simon Yates took his second stage win of the race from a reduced breakaway of six at the summit of the first-category climb to Prat d'Albis. Pinot attacked the group of general classification contenders with remaining to finish in second place with Landa, 33 seconds behind, progressing to fourth overall. The duo of Bernal and Buchmann came in 33' down, followed by the last few breakaway riders, and then the group of favourites, led by Thomas, who finished 1' 22\" behind Yates.\nThe following day was the Tour's second rest day. By this point, overall race leader Alaphilippe was exceeding expectations, with a 1' 35\" lead over Thomas. Kruijswijk was third at 1' 47\", followed by Pinot, Bernal and Buchmann respectively. The green jersey was still held by Sagan, who now had a lead of 85 points over second-placed Viviani, while the mountains classification was still led by Wellens.\nThird week: Southern France, Alps and finale in Paris.\nAs the Tour came down from the Pyrenees for transitional stages towards the Alps, it experienced the beginning of the July 2019 European heat wave, which saw temperatures reach a high of during stage 16. Ewan won the stage from a bunch sprint in Nîmes, his second of the Tour. Crashes during the stage included overall favourites Thomas and Fuglsang, with the latter forced to abandon. In the following stage, the 33-rider breakaway's advantage grew to 15 minutes at one point. Matteo Trentin of attacked a reduced breakaway with from the finish on the final climb, the third-category Côte de la Sentinelle, and soloed to victory with lead of 37 seconds, with peloton over 20 minutes behind. Luke Rowe () and Tony Martin () were both disqualified from the Tour following an altercation near the front of the peloton in the latter part of the stage.\nStage 18, the first in the Alps, was led by breakaway riders throughout the stage's climbs, which included the first-category Col de Vars and the \"hors catégorie\" Col d'Izoard and Col du Galibier. The 34-strong breakaway had been reduced to a group of elite riders by the foot of the Galibier, the final climb. Nairo Quintana attacked with still to climb, and by the summit had built a lead of over a minute and a half, which he held on the descent to the finish. Meanwhile, with remaining of the Galibier, Bernal attacked from within the group of general classification contenders containing Alaphilippe and Thomas, allowing Bernal to recover half a minute on his rivals by the finish and move up to second overall. The lead of the mountains classification went to Romain Bardet, who was a pre-race favourite for the yellow jersey but moved out of contention after losing 20 minutes on stage 14's Col du Tourmalet, thereafter switching focus to breakaway rides.\nAround into stage 19, Pinot, who had been placed fifth in the general classification, abandoned the race with a leg muscle injury. At the head of the race in the closing kilometres of the planned second to last climb, the \"hors catégorie\" Col de l'Iseran, Bernal attacked from the group of overall contenders, catching and passing final breakaway riders by the summit. Next over the top were breakers Simon Yates and Warren Barguil (), one minute behind Bernal, with the yellow jersey contenders following. Alaphilippe was dropped following Bernal's attack, and was two minutes behind at the summit. During the descent, the race was neutralised when a hailstorm caused ice and landslides to block the route to the final climb to Tignes, particularly a mudslide at the foot of the descent before Val-d'Isère. Times for the general classification were taken at the summit of the Iseran, with the stage victory and most combative rider of the day not awarded. As a result, Bernal, who had been in second place overall, moved ahead of Alaphilippe and took the yellow jersey. The stage was shortened from to .\nThe inclement weather also caused the penultimate stage to be reduced in length beforehand, from to , bypassing the first-category Cormet de Roselend and the second-category Côte de Longefoy, with the only climb being the \"hors catégorie\"-rated one to Val Thorens at the finish. A group of 29 riders established a two-and-a-half minute lead over the peloton, before being vastly reduced to six on the early slopes of the Val Thorens climb. With remaining, Nibali attacked from this group and soloed to victory, ten seconds ahead of chasers Landa and Alejandro Valverde. Close behind, Bernal and Thomas led the other general classification contenders Urán, Buchmann and Kruijswijk. Alaphilippe was dropped again, losing three minutes to Bernal and dropping from second overall to fifth.\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Ewan in a bunch sprint on the Champs-Élysées, his third win and the most of any rider in this edition of the race. Bernal won the race with no changes in the final stage. The 22-year-old Colombian became the youngest since François Faber in 1909 and first Latin American Tour winner. Thomas came second overall, 1' 11\" down on Bernal, with Kruijswijk a further 20 seconds behind in third. Sagan won a record seventh points classification with a total of 316, 68 ahead of Ewan in second. Bardet won the mountains classification with 86 points, 8 ahead of Bernal in second. The young rider classification was won by Bernal, with thirteenth-placed overall Gaudu second. Bernal became the fifth rider to win both the general and young rider classification in the same year, following Laurent Fignon (1983), Jan Ullrich (1997), Alberto Contador (2007), and Andy Schleck (2010). The squad finished as the winners of the team classification, 47' 54\" ahead of second-placed . Of the 176 starters, 155 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nFour main individual classifications and a team competition were contested in the race. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders received 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. In an effort to animate racing in the general classification, time bonuses of 8, 5, and 2 seconds respectively were also awarded for the first three riders across a mountain summit, given out on eight climbs. These occurred on stages 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 19. These bonuses replaced the special time \"bonus point\" sprints that were a feature in the 2018 edition. For crashes within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved would have received the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. In celebration of 100th anniversary of the yellow jersey, individual jersey designs were worn on each stage, apart from the first.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type, and sprints, with the first fifteen places in all receiving points. In flat stages, 50 points were given to the stage winner, down to 2 points for 15th place. In hilly stages, the winner gained 30 points, also down to 2 points. In mountain stages, individual time trials and intermediate sprints, 20 points were given to the winners, down to 1 point. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Mountains ranked \"hors catégorie\" gave 20 points to the first rider to cross the summit, down to 2 points to the 8th cyclist. For first-category climbs, 6 riders received points, with 10 for the first rider to reach the summit. Second-, third- and fourth-category climbs gave 5, 2 and 1 points to the first rider respectively. Double points were awarded at the top of the five planned \"hors catégorie\" climbs higher than . The cyclist with the most points led the classification, wearing a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible. This meant that in order to compete in the classification, a rider had to be born after 1 January 1994. Of the 176 starters, 48 were eligible. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe classification for the teams was calculated by adding together the times of the first three cyclists of a team on each stage; the leading team was the one with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team would have determined the outcome of a tie. The riders on the team that led this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib for the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Julian Alaphilippe won the overall super-combativity award, again awarded by a jury.\nA total of €2,291,700 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 160 were awarded money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The team classification winners earned €50,000. €11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000. The Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage 14, and the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col de l'Iseran on stage 19. Thibaut Pinot won the Jacques Goddet and Egan Bernal claimed the Henri Desgrange.\nUCI rankings.\nFor the UCI World Ranking system, riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams competed individually, for their teams, and for their nations, winning points that contributed towards separate rankings, which included all UCI road races. There was also an individual ranking introduced for the 2019 season that only took into account UCI stage races, the Stage Race World Ranking. Points were awarded to the top 60 in the general classification, each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage, the top 5 finishers in each stage and for the top 3 in the final points and mountains classifications.\nThe points accrued by Egan Bernal moved him from 23rd to 6th in the individual World Ranking and from ninth to second in the Stage Race World Ranking. Julian Alaphilippe retained his position at the top of individual World Ranking, with and Belgium also holding the lead of the team and nation ranking respectively."

        "title": "UMass Minutewomen ice hockey",
        "text": "The UMass Minutemen women's ice hockey team represents the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) in Women's Division 1 of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) and in the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League (ECWHL). The Minutemen are one of the ACHA's premier programs, having qualified for 16 of the 20 ACHA National Tournaments held for women's teams (within 18 years of total ACHA membership), a number second to Michigan State for the all-time lead. Additionally, UMass has won four ECWHL playoff titles (a conference championship total that trails only rival Rhode Island nationally) and has been the home of two Zoë M. Harris Award winners (Maura Grainger in 2008–09 and Brittani Lanzilli in 2015–16), one of five ACHA D1 programs to produce multiple recipients of the honor.\nBill Wright has been the team's head coach since 2012 and has led the Minutemen to their only ACHA championship game appearance (2014).\nHistory.\nEarly seasons (2002–07).\nUMass began play in the ACHA for the 2002–03 season and almost immediately joined soon-to-be archrival Rhode Island as one of the northeastern United States' two dominant ACHA programs, a status that has continued to the present day with only rare interruption.\nUnder head coach Bill Finn, and featuring early stars like three-time All-American Aleta Mills, Jacqui Phillips, Samatha Louras and goalie Becky Trudel, the Minutemen finished second in the East Region and received an autobid to the third-ever ACHA National Tournament, in Muskegon, Michigan. UMass performed well at nationals, finishing second in their four-team group after wins over Northern Michigan and St. Cloud State. While that outcome would have meant a trip to the semifinals under subsequent formats, in 2003 it meant that the Minutemen were dumped in the third-place game, where they dropped a decision to West Los Angeles College. Despite the disappointing finish, the program had announced its arrival in a way few have, before or since.\nThe 2003–04 season saw UMass contribute to two notable pieces of history. That season, the program helped start the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League, with Rhode Island, Penn State, Buffalo and Boston University as the other founding members. From January 16–19, 2004, UMass hosted an event dubbed the \"UMass White Out Tournament,\" the first mid-season showcase event held within the ACHA's women's divisions. Invited teams included new conference opponents Rhode Island and Buffalo, along with West LA College, Robert Morris (IL) (the eventual champion) and Colorado. Louras, meanwhile, finished that year with 37 points, good enough to place ninth on the ACHA's top scorers list and become the first documented Minuteman to rank in the top ten.\nThe Minutemen made it to the ECWHL championship game to close each of the league's first three seasons, but as was the pattern of the time, lost each to URI (the Rams were the circuit's dominant team early on and would not lose an ECWHL playoff game until 2011). The maroon and white did, however, fire off back-to-back ACHA National Tournament bids in 2005 and 2006. The first was the stronger of the two runs, thanks to a 3–1 pool win over Michigan, powered by Emily Slotnick's game-winning goal and two assists, that sent UMass through to the quarterfinals. The Great Lakes State got the best of the Bay State when given another chance though, as Michigan State upended the Minutemen 2–1 on the way to a second-place finish.\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, UMass continued to grow its program by aggressively pursuing scheduling against NCAA varsity opposition, including Castleton State, MIT, Sacred Heart and Holy Cross.\nThe team hosted the ACHA National Tournament at the Mullins Center to close 2006–07, a tournament notable as the first in association history to include two women's divisions, as ACHA Women's Division 2 began play that season. St. Scholastica won the inaugural D2 title, while Robert Morris (IL) took the crown in the Minutemen's D1. UMass, meanwhile, was somewhat fortunate to receive an automatic hosting bid to the tourney that year – that final season's ranking of 15th was its lowest ever and one that wouldn't have otherwise earned a spot a nationals. The Minutemen did outperform their seed, thanks to a 4–0 upset of No. 8 Michigan in the pool round that advanced UMass to the quarterfinals, however a 1–0 loss to Rhode Island there ended the run.\nRise to prominence (2007–12).\nThe 2007–08 and 2008–09 seasons were notable as UMass' first serious foray into the national championship discussion, thanks to new head coach Chris Cobb and a sudden talent infusion led by Maura Grainger and URI transfer Cara Murphy. Grainger, who began her collegiate career with Providence College's NCAA Division I program, fired home 44 goals and 74 points during her first season in Amherst (the latter number a program record), and would go on to win UMass' first Zoë M. Harris Award the following year. Murphy, for her part, totaled 88 points in just 50 games over her two seasons. The Minutemen entered the 2008 ACHA National Tournament as the number four seed and battered Michigan State and Nichols by identical 5–2 scorelines to win Pool D, then topped Wisconsin (Pool C's second-place team) 4–1 in the quarterfinals. Things went down from there however, as Lindenwood (which was then in the heart of a streak of five consecutive title game appearances with four wins) knocked UMass off of the championship track in the semifinals. Rhode Island, with the stakes much lower than in the previous tournament, then defeated the Minutemen by a 3–1 count in the third-place game.\nA follow-up effort in 2009's championships in Rochester, New York saw UMass fall one round earlier – in the quarterfinals – yet arguably closer to a title. Thanks to some unfortunate pool placement, largely due to eventual runner-up Robert Morris (IL) underachieving during the regular season and ranking fifth, the fourth-seeded Minutemen drew the Eagles in their pool, where they dropped a 5–2 result. While UMass still advanced to the quarterfinals, it did so as second in its pool as was therefore paired up with a pool winner in the form of Lindenwood, a team on the way to the second of three consecutive national championships. The Bay Staters did push the Lions like few teams of that era could though, in taking an early lead before LU tied things up late, then won in double overtime on an Alexandra Johansson goal. Still, 2008–09 did see one unprecedented success: UMass finally broke through and finished first in the ECWHL standings to take the regular season league title, the first time since the ECWHL's founding that Rhode Island did not win both the regular season and playoff crowns. URI managed to save face by quadrupling a Caitlin Scannell goal in a 4–1 win for that year's playoff title.\nGrainger's departure for 2009–10, along with the loss of other stars like Murphy, Jill Clark and standout goalie Christen Eulian, signaled a bit of a transition period for the program. Even UMass' customary spot in the top two of ECWHL was no longer safe thanks to Northeastern, which won the ACHA Division 2 national championship in 2009–10, then immediately moved up to Division 1. The Huskies emphatically announced their arrival by winning both ECWHL titles in 2010–11. Even with less conference success than had become customary, the Minutemen did continue to qualify for nationals – albeit narrowly, as the 8th, 7th and 8th seed in the eight-team fields of 2010, 2011 and 2012, with their 2012 inclusion ahead of an ECWHL regular season champion Penn State squad seen as controversial in some corners. However, the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons saw UMass stockpile much of the core that would lead to the team's next substantial ACHA title run, including Sarah Oteri, Chelsea Corell, Amanda Abromson, Sam Gouin, Meghan Crosby, Caleigh Labossiere and Chelsea and Raschelle Bräm. The high ceiling of that group began to show during the 2012 ACHA National Tournament, when UMass silenced doubters with a shocking run to the semifinals thanks to pool round ties against the first and third seeds (Robert Morris (IL) and Rhode Island), then a win over sixth-ranked Michigan to sneak ahead of URI into second place in the group. That set up an unlikely semifinal pairing between the two lowest-seeded teams in the tournament: the Minutemen and No. 7 Northeastern. However, the Huskies took the all-Massachusetts tilt 4–0 and went on to win the title behind tournament MVP goalie Chelsea Dietz, who conceded just three goals in five tournament games.\nUMass scored a historic 4–3 victory over three-time defending national champion Lindenwood on January 22, 2011, thanks to Rachel Gantt's late power play winner and 47 saves by Kelsey Magrane. The Lions lost just 26 times in eight ACHA seasons before moving to NCAA Division I following that 2010–11 season, and although they were missing six players due to the 2011 World University Games tournament, the squad remaining stateside went 4–0 against other opponents during the tournament, including a pair of wins against contender Robert Morris (IL).\nBill Wright era (2012–present).\n2012–13.\nThe Minutewomen got a new head coach in 2012–13 when Bill Wright took over for Chris Cobb, who had taken a coaching job in NCAA Division III with Williams College. Wright inherited a strong team that already included the aforementioned stars, along with key freshmen Ally Perdios and Jess Greenwood, and Penn State transfer Paige Harrington. By the end of the regular season, were ranked second only to Liberty. That bit of history was made possible by another: UMass' first-ever ECWHL tournament title, thanks to a 2–1 title game win over defending ACHA national champion Northeastern. An impressive journey at the ACHA National Tournament in Ashburn, Virginia followed, with an opening 3–2 win over 2011 national champ Michigan State, as second-period goals from Oteri, Labossiere and Chelsea Bräm turned around an early 2–0 deficit. Although Northeastern took an ECWHL final rematch in the day one nightcap (the first day of the tournament involved two pool games played by each team at the time), two more Oteri goals delivered a vital 2–1 victory over Robert Morris (IL) that, along with tiebreaker help, sent UMass through to the semifinals for the third time in program history. Once there, however, eventual champ Minnesota jumped on the Minutemen for three goals in the first ten minutes of the contest en route to a 5–1 result.\n2013–14.\nAfter coming off of a pair of ACHA semifinal appearances and beginning fifth in the rankings, the Minutemen put together a 20–6–1 regular season to climb into the second seed for ACHAs, just three voting points ahead of Rhode Island in third. The URI side likely felt that they deserved better thanks to their 2–0 shutout of UMass to recapture the ECWHL playoff title, although the Minutemen would be able to point to their sweep of Rhody by identical 4–1 scores just two weeks prior to that in reply. Away from the ACHA (and the Western Hempishere, for that matter), Abromson, Corell, Harrington, Labossiere and Oteri were selected for the 2013 U.S. National University Team that competed at the 2013 World University Games, eventually winning bronze medals in Trentino, Italy in December 2013.\nThe pool round at the ACHA National Tournament in Newark, Delaware was a tight-checking, nail-biting two days. An upstart Liberty team (the runners-up from 2013, but only seeded seventh in 2014) gave the Minutemen all the trouble they wanted before a Chelsea Bräm goal with 5:02 remaining squeaked out a 2–1 victory. That evening, UMass survived another close call, as Labossiere buried Adrian in overtime by a 2–1 count after the Bulldogs tied things late. After those two wins secured a spot in the semifinals – and results early on the second day of the tournament clinched first place in the pool – Robert Morris (IL) overcame two Harrington goals with five in the second period, as the Eagles picked up what amounted to a consolation win by a 6–4 count. The contest was notable as a meeting of future Buffalo Beauts teammates Harrington and Hayley Williams (who grabbed an assist), and as a World University Games reunion of sorts – in addition to the five Minutemen and Williams, RMU's Jessica Merritt and Ramey Weaver were also on Team USA, with the latter both its captain and leading scorer.\nIn the semifinals, UMass and Rhode Island played one of the most significant chapters of the many in their storied rivalry. Corell and URI's Kayla DiLorenzo, two of the ACHA's best goalies, traded big saves with 29 and 23 stops, respectively, but early goals from Labossiere and Raschelle Bräm were just enough for a 2–1 victory. The Minutemen fell one win short of their intended destination though, as Miami University formally launched a dynasty that would eventually grab three national titles in four years with a 3–1 championship game win. Siobhan Elvin scored a shorthanded goal for UMass to make the score 2–1 early in the second period, but Kaley Mooney answered quickly for the RedHawks and penalty trouble down the stretch doomed a comeback attempt. Nevertheless, the second-place finish remains the program's high water mark.\n2014–15 and 2015–16.\nAlthough the next two years didn't produce much success at nationals (UMass failed to win a game at the tournament in both 2015 and 2016), particularly compared to the three straight final four runs of 2012 through 2014, they were marked by gains in other areas. For example, after a lengthy stretch of Rhode Island dominance from 2003 to 2010 and heavily contested outcomes from 2010 to 2014, 2014–15 more or less kicked off UMass' tenure as the rulers of the ECWHL. A 15–3–0 league record was good enough to edge URI for the regular season title, and the Minutemen followed that up by shelling the Rams 7–2 in the playoff championship game behind two goals each from Mallory O'Brien and Brittani Lanzilli. That win set off a run of three straight league title game wins for the Minutemen through the 2016–17 season, each over URI, as UMass gained the upper hand in the storied rivalry.\nOn October 11, 2014, UMass had the opportunity to play in the 8,387-seat main arena of the Mullins Center for the first time during Wright's tenure, a rarity as the team typically practices and plays in the adjacent Community Rink. Although the game was delayed for 45 minutes due to ice conditions (the UMass men's team tore up the ice just prior to the scheduled game time while being bag skated following their 8–1 defeat to Jack Eichel and Boston University the night before), UMass topped Penn State 1–0 on a second-period Michaela Tosone goal and a Kasey Zegel shutout.\nDuring the 2015–16 season Lanzilli, then a sophomore, became UMass' second Zoë M. Harris Award winner after topping ACHA Division 1 in scoring with 49 goals and 68 points in just 29 games. Early in the 2016–17 season, the former Medford High School star passed Grainger to become the program's all-time leading scorer. She also became the third Minuteman to earn First or Second Team ACHA All-American status multiple times, following Mills and Angela Rufo.\n2016–17.\nWhile the 2016–17 campaign was similar to the previous two in some ways (a dual ECWHL championship, an ACHA tournament bid), it was also different in others. Beyond his typically stout freshman class, Wright picked up three key transfers, including goaltender Amber Greene (via Penn State's NCAA Division I team), swing player Sonja Klumpp (who led the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference in scoring as a freshman at Maryland) and Olivia Knight (another NCAA player, from Division III's Nichols College). Thus bolstered, the Minutemen wasted no time in picking up the key non-conference win that had proven somewhat elusive in recent seasons: a wild 5–4 outcome over then-second-ranked Liberty, an affair that saw UMass go from up 3–0 after the first period to down 4–3 early in the third, before goals from Tatum Schulz and Joanna Olson pulled the tilt back. Other key non-conference results included a subsequent tie against the Flames, another with No. 1 Miami, still another with No. 5 Grand Valley State and a rout of No. 9 Michigan. Meanwhile, the Minutewomen flexed an unprecedented amount of muscle within the ECWHL, as a late-season tie with Rhode Island was the only blemish on the squad's league record over 14 regular season games and a pair of playoff matches, including the third straight championship game win over URI.\nUMass' quest at the ACHA National Tournament – never in doubt, as the team was not ranked lower than fifth after the Liberty win and finished in fourth – got off to a catastrophic start when the Minutemen had to forfeit the first game of a best-of-three quarterfinal series against fifth-seeded Lindenwood–Belleville (under a new tournament format introduced that season) thanks to Winter Storm Stella and related travel difficulties to Columbus, Ohio. The squad, however, arrived in time for game two and proceeded to overcome the unfortunate series deficit with consecutive wins over the Lynx to return to the semifinals. Lanzilli (who would go on to an all-tournament selection and once again led the nation in scoring) and linemate Olson led the way through the 7–3 and 4–2 wins with a combined six goals and four assists. Top-seeded Liberty abruptly ended things in the final four by handing the Minutemen a 1–0 defeat, thanks to a second-period Chelsey Greenwood goal.\n2017–18.\nIn 2017–18, UMass showed early promise when an Olson overtime goal boosted the Minutemen over a national-title-contending Michigan State team, as part of a solid start to the year. However, the team was decimated with several key injuries by November, including Lanzilli, Kelly Dolan, and Courtney Sullivan, while another notable player, Katy Turner, studied in Hawai'i during the first half of the year. The remaining skaters, particularly Olson, UMass' leading scorer for most of Lanzilli's absence, managed to keep things afloat for the most part, although one casualty of the situation was the ECWHL championship. With the league reduced to three teams, thanks to the departures of Vermont and Northeastern after the 2016–17 season, it did not conduct a playoff, instead declaring its regular season winner the overall champion. While still affected by injuries, the Minutemen dropped their series to Rhode Island with a 1–2–1 record in games played during December and January, and the Rams would go on to win the crown after both they and UMass went 4–0–0 against Penn State, the third remaining ECWHL member.\nNationally, a 1–2–0 weekend at a Robert Morris-hosted showcase in early November (including a come-from-ahead loss to the hosts on a late Emily Urban goal) dropped Massachusetts from 5th to 8th in the rankings, and the Minutemen would spend the remainder of the year on the bubble for the eight-team ACHA National Tournament. A strong finish to the regular season, particularly a key sweep of eventual Western Women's Collegiate Hockey League champion Colorado in February, ultimately locked down an ACHA-best 15th nationals bid for the program. However, second-seeded Adrian made short work of No. 7 UMass at the tournament, sweeping their best-of-three quarterfinal series.\n2018–19 and 2019–20.\nA large chunk of UMass' core from that run of success graduated in 2018 (Lanzilli, Dolan, Greene, Schulz, Meredith Gallagher and Sam Baturin was that year's senior class) and 2019 (which featured an eight-player class including Olson, Knight, Courtney Sullivan, Hannah Sullivan and Meghan Lawler), forcing Wright to execute a reload quickly. While eventual captain Juliana Dolan remained to bridge the generation gap, the next generation of Minutemen stars included Kat Nikolopoulos, who scored 30 points in each of her first two seasons in Amherst, explosive swing player Holly Russell, Minnesotan Sandra Bienkowski, and goaltender Casey Marshall, a product of the esteemed New Jersey Rockets program.\nThe team got off to a 5–1–0 start in 2018–19, but then lost to Michigan State by a 4–3 count on November 2, 2018 and (somewhat inexplicably, as MSU is a perennial top ten team) tumbled from 4th to 8th in the rankings. UMass dropped to 9th the next week after a 1–2–0 weekend at the Robert Morris University Showcase and would not make it back into the top eight for the rest of the season, missing the ACHA National Tournament for the first time since 2004 (a streak of 14 appearances in a row). The Minutemen, as usual, performed strongly within the ECWHL, winning the regular season (which has served as the only league championship since 2018), but were ultimately doomed by a 6–7–0 mark against a tough out-of-conference schedule including powerhouses like the Spartans, Liberty, Lindenwood–Belleville, and McKendree. Juliana Dolan's overtime goal against URI on February 8, 2019, gave Wright his 100th win as head coach.\nAfter that hiccup, 2019–20 saw a return to UMass' more typical form including just six losses all season, four of which came against two-time defending national champion Liberty. Season sweeps of ECWHL opponents Rhode Island and Penn State helped the team stay in the 5th or 6th spot in the rankings all year long, but the Minutemen truly announced themselves as a contender on January 18, 2020, with a 2–0 victory against No. 3 Lindenwood–Belleville fueled by a 32-save Marshall shutout and goals from Nikolopoulos and Dolan.\nUMass qualified for their 16th ACHA National Tournament as the fifth seed and were scheduled to take on fourth-seeded Adrian in the quarterfinals, however the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, Wright was honored as the ACHA Division 1 coach of the year on the heels of the bounceback season.\nRecent season by season results.\n† The ECWHL's regular season winner was named its sole champion, by mutual agreement of the membership and the commissioner\n‡ The 2020 ACHA National Tournament was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nACHA National Tournament results.\nThe Minutemen have appeared in the ACHA National Tournament 16 times, with top-four finishes in 2003, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2017.

A preseason ranking was initiated beginning with 2014–15, then discontinued in 2018–19 when the ACHA switched to an entirely computer-based ranking. Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the ACHA tabulated rankings each week during the season and issued them on Tuesdays following weekends including games.\nRegional rankings.\nFrom 2000–01 through 2002–03, regional rankings were the sole method for determining ACHA National Tournament bids. The inaugural 2000–01 season featured teams divided into East and West Regions, with the top four from each in February's final ranking invited to nationals. For 2001–02 and 2002–03 (the latter being UMass' first ACHA season), the setup was expanded to include East, Central and West Regions. Under that system, the top two from each region were invited to nationals, along with two wild card teams. In 2003–04, the tournament field was expanded to 12 teams, and a national ranking was introduced. The latter development diminished the importance of the regional rankings, as the national rankings were used to determine nationals bids. Regional champions were still awarded an autobid, however, even if ranked outside of the top 12 nationally. In 2004–05, growth in the number of ACHA women's teams resulted in an increase to four regions – Northeast, Southeast, Central and West – although things reverted to East, Central and West in 2007–08. The 2009–10 season was notable both for the fact that the tournament field was reduced back to eight teams and as the final year of the regional system, which had become largely antiquated as regional champions generally had little issue placing highly in the national rankings.\nACHA national honors.\nAnnual awards.\nAll-Americans and All-Tournament selections including all seasons except 2008–09.

UMass has been among the ACHA's top-contributing programs to the WUG effort, including a total of eight different players selected for Team USA 11 times.\nMinutemen have generally been far more than passengers when selected. Paige Harrington served as an alternate captain both times she was a member of Team USA, including for the 2013 event in Trentino, Italy, which saw Harrington and four other Minutemen win bronze medals. It was a historic finish as a first medal for any American team in the modern era (USA Hockey resumed its participation in the WUG on the men's side in 2001 after a lengthy hiatus) and just the second overall, following the U.S. men in 1972 (who \"earned\" bronze medals by finishing third in a three-team tournament). Amanda Abromson led the 2013 UMass delegation in scoring with a pair of goals and an assist, including a go-ahead marker in the semifinals against Russia, while goalie Chelsea Corell appeared in three contests, including a preliminary-round shutout of Spain.\nThree Minutemen from the 2013 team – Harrington, Abromson and Caleigh Labossiere – returned to play at the 2015 World University Games and were joined by newcomer Vicki Bortolussi. Although Team USA dropped out of medal contention quickly, the UMass players combined for 12 points over five tournament games. One of the points, an assist by Labossiere, set up Emily Ford's overtime goal in a come-from-behind victory against Kazakhstan that helped clinch fifth place.\nThe 2017 edition of the squad, which included Brittani Lanzilli and Amber Greene, repeated 2013's trip to the podium by again winning the bronze medal. Greene, Team USA's starting goalie, excelled throughout the tournament, finishing third among all netminders in both goals against average (3.00) and save percentage (0.929). She made 32 saves on 34 Japan shots in a key 3–2 U.S. pool round win that (eventually) allowed the team to advance to the semifinals, and then delivered a 28-save shutout of China in the bronze medal match.\n2010 ACHA women's select team.\nAs a precursor to World University Games participation, the ACHA assembled a women's select team that toured Geneva, Switzerland, Chamonix, France and Méribel, France during April 2010. The team included Brittany Resendes as UMass' sole player representative, while Minutemen head coach Chris Cobb was an assistant to Rhode Island's Beth McCann. Its final record overseas was 2–2–0, including two close losses to the France women's national ice hockey team and two decisive wins over local club teams.\nProfessional players.\nUMass has, by most measures, been the ACHA's most successful program in terms of advancing players to women's professional hockey leagues. The group is headlined by Paige Harrington, who signed a one-year, $10,000 contract with the Buffalo Beauts of the National Women's Hockey League for the team and circuit's inaugural 2015–16 season. After re-signing for a second season, Harrington helped the Beauts to the 2017 Isobel Cup through a 3–2 title-game upset of the Boston Pride, avenging a championship game loss to the Pride to end the previous year. That July, Harrington signed with the Pride – the closest NWHL team to her hometown of Mansfield, Massachusetts – for the 2017–18 campaign, her last as a pro.\nChelsea and Raschelle Bräm played for SC Reinach in Switzerland from their 2014 graduations through the 2019–20 season. They have been teammates with several notable Swiss players during their careers including Florence Schelling and Julia Marty, both of whom won bronze medals at the 2014 Winter Olympics. SC Reinach struggled in 2016–17, but the twins were vital in a relegation series win against SC Weinfelden, combining for four goals and seven points to save their squad's top-flight status. Of particular importance among those points were Raschelle's goal and assist and Chelsea's goal in a 4–0 fourth-game win to force a decisive fifth contest. SC Reinach then bounced back in 2017–18 to qualify for the playoffs, in part thanks to Raschelle's career-best ten points, and has been a fixture there since.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Bräms switched teams and signed with ZSC Lions, citing a desire to move to Zürich.\nRivalries.\nRhode Island.\nFew, if any, rivalries in the ACHA match the history and stakes of UMass' frequent showdowns with Rhode Island. The two teams were founding members of the Eastern Collegiate Women's Hockey League in 2003–04, and are the only two to remain in the league through its entire existence. No fewer than 10 times in the 14 seasons where an ECWHL playoff has been held, the title game has been a UMass-URI contest, with the Rams enjoying a 7–3 advantage in those games (although the Minutemen have won the last three). Among the more memorable ECWHL championship games were two overtime contests, both won by URI, including a 5–4 result in 2005. Three years later, Rhode Island stormed out to a 3–0 lead after the first period, only to see UMass reply with four unanswered to take the lead in the third period. However, the Rams forced overtime with a late equalizer, allowing URI's Justine Ducie to win the trophy in the sixth minute of the third extra period. Most recently, Amber Greene's 26-save shutout allowed second-period goals by Brittani Lanzilli, Lanzilli again and Michaela Tosone to produce a 3–0 win on February 26, 2017. Even when not competing head to head, the league nearly always runs through at least one of the teams, as there have been only three regular season or playoff titles in ECWHL history won by anyone else (Northeastern won the regular season and playoff championships in 2010–11, Penn State took the regular season in 2011–12).\nNot surprisingly, the northeast's two dominant programs are also frequent factors in the bigger picture, as both programs rank in the top five nationally in the number of ACHA National Tournament appearances. Since 2002–03, one of the two has been among the ACHA's final four to end 12 of 17 seasons in which a tournament was contested. Somewhat surprisingly, given all of that, UMass has only run into Rhode Island five times at nationals, and only three times with something other than bragging rights attached (two meetings, both URI wins, were the 2008 third-place game and a 2016 pool round meeting after both teams had already been eliminated). In 2007, the Rams edged UMass 1–0 at the Mullins Center to end the bottom-seeded Minutemen's chances in the quarterfinals. A 2012 pool round game ended in a 1–1 tie as Sarah Oteri and Johanna Leskinen traded goals while Chelsea Corell and Kayla DiLorenzo traded saves, although the Minutemen ultimately advanced to the tournament semifinals ahead of Rhode Island. In 2014, the biggest game of the group took place, in the national semifinals. Corell and DiLorenzo (both of whom ended the year among the national top five in goals against average, save percentage and shutouts) engaged in another goaltending duel, but first-period markers from Caleigh Labossiere and Raschelle Bräm proved decisive in a 2–1 UMass victory.\nThat 2013–14 season was a defining one of the rivalry in several ways, even prior to the semifinal tilt, as each team presented one of the most talented rosters in their respective storied histories. They combined to contribute eight players – more than one-third of the roster – to the 2013 World University Games bronze medal effort, including Lauren Hillberg, Alisha Difilippo and Cassie Catlow on the URI side. Back in the U.S., the Rams and Minutemen jockeyed at the top of the ACHA and ECWHL as usual, with neither ranked lower than fifth all year long. Rhode Island won the conference bragging rights with a 2–0 ECWHL championship game win to follow up the regular season title. However, the Minutemen edged out the Rams to finish second in the rankings thanks to a sweep just before the ECWHL playoffs and, of course, would go on to win the head-to-head matchup in the ACHA semifinals.\nImmediately after 2013–14, UMass went on a run of three consecutive ECWHL playoff championship game wins over URI, along with four of the next six regular season titles. The Rams did manage the regular season and overall title in 2017–18, as well as the 2015–16 regular-season crown. The series, beginning with the 2014–15 season, is 20–9–3 in UMass' favor.\nOne other significant event in the rivalry's history took place in 2007, when Cara Murphy transferred from URI to UMass. Murphy had been a second-team All-American twice with the Rams, while leading the team in scoring during the 2006–07 season. She finished her career in the Bay Staters' colors with another pair of All-American seasons.\nPenn State.\nWhile UMass' rivalry with Penn State pales in comparison to the one with URI, it has nevertheless been a consistent presence throughout Minutemen program history as PSU, like UMass and URI, was a founding member of the ECWHL and has been in the league for all but two of its 14 seasons. The teams have met four times at the ECWHL playoffs (a scheduled fifth was nixed by a 2010 snowstorm), with UMass enjoying a 3–1–0 advantage in those games. None were better than the contest that took place on February 28, 2004, at Rhode Island's Brad Boss Arena. The wild affair saw Aleta Mills and Samantha Louras each score four times – yet it wasn't quite enough, as the Lady Icers' Katie King scored four of her own on the way to an 8–8 tie after regulation, where neither team ever led by more than two and with only three stretches of more than 5:00 without a goal being scored. In the second overtime, Mills' fifth tally sent the Minutemen to the first-ever league championship game.\nThe Minutemen have faced Penn State once at the ACHA National Tournament. In that game, a pool round meeting on March 5, 2015, PSU ran out to a 3–1 lead after two periods but UMass rallied for a 3–3 tie after Amanda Abromson scored with 1:04 left in regulation.\nSimilarly to the Rhode Island rivalry with respect to Cara Murphy, UMass has also poached some of its all-time greats from Penn State. Future NWHL player Paige Harrington began her career at PSU in 2011–12, where she helped the Lady Icers go 2–0–1 against the Minutemen, including a win in the ECWHL semifinals. The Mansfield, Massachusetts native subsequently returned home and would go 3–1–1 against Penn State over the rest of her career. Goaltender and 2017 World University Games hero Amber Greene also began her collegiate career at Penn State, although as a member of the school's separate NCAA Division I team.\nSince the ECWHL's founding, the Minutemen are 37–12–2 against Penn State, through the 2019–20 season."

        "text": "Richard Barker (born 21 March 1981) is a British former professional tennis player.\nBiography.\nBarker was a doubles specialist, often partnering with twin brother William. The brothers were born in the West Midlands town of Solihull and went to King Edward's School in Birmingham. At the age of 12, Barker was the British 12 and Under singles champion, but soon after the twins decided to focus on education and stayed away from tennis for four years. In order to pursue both academia and tennis, they opted to move to the United States and attend Rice University. In their junior year the pair put together a streak of 35 consecutive wins, a run which ended in the semifinals of the NCAA Division I Championships. For their performances that season they were named the ITA's \"doubles team of the year\". He graduated with a degree in mathematical analysis and began competing professionally in the second half of 2004.\nIn 2005 the twins were runners-up at the Surbiton Challenger, played in the main draw of the Nottingham Open and competed at the Wimbledon Championships. At Wimbledon they entered the draw as wildcards and were eliminated in the first round by the tournament's top seeds, Jonas Björkman and Max Mirnyi. Straight after his Wimbledon appearance, Barker won a Challenger title at Forest Hills, partnering American Huntley Montgomery, after which he attained his career best ranking of 161. This was however to be his final professional tournament. Both brothers retired from tennis, as they didn't see a future for the doubles format. To counter this, they were the driving force behind a class-action lawsuit which sought an injection to stop the ATP's planned changes to doubles. The lawsuit, which gained support from several high-profile doubles players including the Bryan brothers, was filed in a U.S. District Court in Houston during the 2005 US Open. At the end of the year the ATP announced that the third set would be replaced by a first-to-10 tiebreak while also removing ad-scoring.\nHe lives with wife Lauren in Houston and is an executive director at J.P.

        "text": "Marcus Sebastian Smith (born 14 February 1999) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a fly-half for Premiership Rugby club Harlequins. Born in the Philippines, he represents England at international level after qualifying on ancestry grounds.\nEarly life.\nBorn in the Philippines to a British father and a Filipina mother, Smith started playing rugby union at the age of seven for Centaurs RFC when his family moved to Singapore. He moved to the United Kingdom at the age of thirteen and subsequently received a sports scholarship to attend Brighton College, where he captained the school's 1st XV. The young fly-half was named Player of the Tournament at the 2016 St Joseph's Rugby Festival.\nClub career.\nThe fly-half first represented Harlequins at the 2016 Premiership Rugby Sevens Series.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, as part of the Harlequin Elite Player Development Group (EPDG), Smith played five fixtures for the Harlequin U18s Academy side, scoring two tries; one each against London Irish and Saracens and contributing ten points from the tee in Harlequins U18s Academy Final win over Sale Sharks U18s.\nIn March 2017, Smith was promoted from the EPDG up to the full-time Academy starting in June.\nSmith was named in the 12-man senior squad, alongside another Brighton College graduate Calum Waters, for the 2017 Singha Premiership Rugby Sevens at Franklin's Gardens. Smith scored two tries against London Irish on the first day and assisted Harlequins in reaching the club semi-final before losing out to Newcastle Falcons.\nOn 2 September 2017 Smith made his professional debut wearing the number 10 jersey for the senior Harlequins side in the Premiership Rugby London Double Header fixture against London Irish at Twickenham Stadium. Two weeks later, Smith gave a Man-of-the-Match performance against Wasps, helping to end the home side's 20-match winning streak at Ricoh Arena.\nHe started in the Premiership final against Exeter Chiefs on 26 June 2021 as Harlequins won the game 40–38 in the highest scoring Premiership final ever, which included four conversions from Smith's boot.\nIn the Heineken Champions Cup match between Harlequins and Castres Olympique on 21/01/22, Smith scored the final conversion after Alex Dombrandt scored the final try, giving Harlequins a win of 36 to 33.\nIn March 2023, having been left out of the training squad for England's 2023 Six Nations fixture that week, Smith won man of the match in Harlequins Big Game fixture, beating Exeter Chiefs 40-5.\nDuring the 2023–24 Champions Cup, Smith scored a try and a drop goal, winning man of the match at Harlequins beat Racing 92 31-28 away. In March 2024, he won man of the match again, scoring a try and supplying a cross-field kick to André Esterhuizen as Harlequins won their first ever Champions Cup knockout game, beating Glasgow Warriors 28-24 at home in the Round of 16. The following week he kicked 5 conversions in the club's 42-41 defeat of Union Bordeaux Bègles in the quarter finals making it only the second time the club had won a knockout stage game in the competition and there first away victory at this stage. Following their qualification to the semi finals, Smith was one of eight players nominated for Player of the Championship for the 2023-24 season.\nInternational career.\nEngland U18.\nSmith started his first England appearance with a try in an under-16s match victory against Wales in April 2015. In February 2017 Smith represented the England under-20 team against Italy in the 2017 Six Nations Under 20s Championship and then in April 2017 scored a try for the England under-18 team against Ireland.\nIn May 2017, Smith took part in a training session with the elite senior England squad, during their 3-day camp at Brighton College, in preparation for the Old Mutual Wealth Cup match against the Barbarians and their summer tour to Argentina.\nIn July 2017 Smith was named in the England U18s squad for a tour of South Africa in August but was withdrawn prior to the tour and instead on 3 August 2017 Smith was named in Eddie Jones' pre-season senior England training squad. Eddie Jones described Smith's inclusion in the senior squad as part of the plan to develop young players as well as to give pressure on experienced players such as Owen Farrell and George Ford.\nEngland U20.\nOn 22 September 2017, Smith was named in the 33-man England training squad for a camp in Oxford ahead of the Autumn internationals, although England coach Eddie Jones said he would be \"treated like an apprentice\". In the following month on 26 October, Smith was called into the England squad for the Autumn international series. He was also part of the training squad during the 2018 Six Nations Championship.\nSmith was named in the England U20 squad for the 2018 World Rugby Under 20 Championship in France and scored tries in pool games against Argentina and Italy. He started at fly-half for the semi-final against South Africa and defeat in the final against France as England finished runners up to the hosts. Smith declined selection for the 2019 World Rugby Under 20 Championship.\nEngland.\nAfter declining to join the 2019 U-20 team, Smith instead made his non-capped England debut on 2 June 2019 against the Barbarians. During the game, Smith contributed 26 points, including a try towards a 51–43 victory for England and was awarded Man-of-the-Match for his performance.\nOn 4 July 2021, Smith made his full England test debut against the United States, contributing 13 points, including a try, in a 43–29 victory. He earned his second start against Canada six days later, with a faultless kicking display in a 70–14 win for England.\nIn the 2021 Autumn rugby union internationals Smith scored a try as a second-half replacement against Tonga on 6th November, and kicked five conversions. He started the match against Australia the following week as fly-half but often stood outside Owen Farrell until Farrell went off injured in the second half. He played a full match at fly-half against South Africa on 20th November, kicking three conversions and two penalties, one in the last minute to give England the victory by a single point.\nEngland's 2022 Six Nations season opened with the Calcutta Cup fixture away at Murrayfield in Edinburgh on 5 February. In the absence of Owen Farrell through injury and George Ford not in the original squad, Smith started at number 10 and his performance was highly praised. However many were surprised that, despite this and England's early dominance, coach Eddie Jones decided to replace Smith after 60 minutes despite his having scored a try and made four successful kicks. In the subsequent Six Nations game against Italy Smith played for the full 80 minutes and scored England's first try and was awarded Man of the Match, an accolade he was again awarded in their next game against Wales. Smith was the highest point scorer for the 2022 Six Nations Championship.\nIn August 2023, England Head Coach Steve Borthwick selected Smith for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. Throughout the tournament, Smith made his international debut at full back having seemingly fallen to third choice at fly half behind George Ford and England Captain Owen Farrell. Smith played at full back throughout the tournament including England's quarter final victory over Fiji, as they went on to finish third at the tournament.\nIn January 2024, it was announced that Smith was on crutches after suffering an injury. It meant that he was likely to miss the Six Nations tournament in what England attack coach Richard Wigglesworth admitted would be a \"blow\" to the team's chances. However he went to feature in the tournament. In England's match against Ireland at Twickenham on March 9, Smith scored a drop goal to end the match and give England the victory with a 23-22 score line. In the final game of the tournament, he put in another impressive performance off the bench. Having replaced George Furbank at full back early on, he scored a try at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais at England narrowly lost 33-31 in France after a late penalty from Thomas Ramos.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nOn 10 July, Smith was called up to the 2021 British and Irish Lions squad as injury cover for Finn Russell.\nOn 17 July, Smith made his British and Irish Lions debut, playing at fly-half for the full 80 minutes against the Stormers. He converted all 7 tries successfully for a 49–3 win for the Lions."

The season progressed through the regular season, many conference tournaments and championship series, and concluded with the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and 2018 College World Series. The College World Series, consisting of the eight remaining teams in the NCAA tournament and held annually in Omaha, Nebraska, at TD Ameritrade Park Omaha, ended on June 28, 2018.\nRealignment and format changes.\nThe 2018 season was also the last for two other teams in their then-current conferences. Both teams moved between the same two conferences, but in opposite directions.\nFinally, one other Division I team changed its institutional and athletic identities immediately after the 2017–18 season. Indiana University and Purdue University dissolved Indiana University – Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) on July 1, 2018. IPFW's academic programs in health sciences transferred to the IU system as Indiana University Fort Wayne; all remaining academic programs were transferred to the Purdue system as Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW). From 2018 to 2019, the former IPFW athletic program represents only PFW, and its Summit League membership was assumed by PFW. Shortly before the dissolution took effect, but after the school's baseball season had finished, the athletic program announced that it would henceforth be known as the Purdue Fort Wayne Mastodons.\nNCAA tournament.\nFor the first time, the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball tournament seeded the top 16 teams, rather than only the top 8 teams as had been the practice since 1999. This ensures that the regional featuring the top-seeded team is paired with the regional hosted by the 16th-seeded team, where in the past Super Regionals were paired generally along geographical lines.\nConference standings.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nOf the 31 Division I athletic conferences that sponsor baseball, 29 end their regular seasons with a single-elimination tournament or a double elimination tournament. The teams in each conference that win their regular season title are given the number one seed in each tournament. Two conferences, the Big West and Pac-12, do not hold a conference tournament. The winners of these tournaments, plus the Big West and Pac-12 regular-season champions, receive automatic invitations to the 2018 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nCollege World Series.\nThe 2018 College World Series began on June 16 in Omaha, Nebraska.\nCoaching changes.\nThis table lists programs that changed head coaches at any point from the first day of the 2018 season until the day before the first day of the 2019 season.

        "title": "Wil Jones (basketball coach)",
        "text": "William Stigler Jones (October 26, 1938 – March 12, 2014) was an American basketball player and coach from Washington D.C. known for his flamboyance as a championship college basketball coach. He was known for his coaching tenures at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) and Norfolk State University.\nBiography.\nPlaying career.\nDunbar High School.\nAs a star at Dunbar High School (DC), he was known as Willie Jones and developed into Washington D.C.’s finest jump shooter and led the city in scoring in 1956.\nAmerican University Eagles.\nIn 1957, Jones joined former Spingarn H.S star Dick Wells on DC’s first racially integrated college basketball team under Mexican American coach David Carrasco at American University. \nWells and Jones led the American University Eagles (AU) to three consecutive Mason-Dixon and Eastern Regional championships.  During the summers, Willie held his own on the District’s competitive playgrounds against such future NBA Hall of Famers as Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. One observer remembers “Willie Jones, whose skills and verbosity made him a D.C. playground legend in the 1950s — he’s known as the city’s original trash talker — is remembered as the most colorful performer in the Baylor and Chamberlain games.” He had tremendous self confidence and once told the Washington Post, “When I went to a tournament the first thing I asked was, ‘Where’s the MVP trophy? Because that’s gonna be in my case tomorrow.’ ”\nJones repeatedly broke AU and conference scoring records and in 1959 his court wizardry gave AU its greatest athletic hour when he pumped in 30 points to lead Carrasco’s team to their first victory over Georgetown, 94–67. \nIn the elite eight 1960 NCAA tournament Willie set a record in scoring an astonishing 54 points (before the 3 point line was installed) against National Champion (Division II) Evansville on their home court. \nJones was named to the first-team, All-American College Division squad that year and invited to the Olympic Trials in Denver, Colorado. The Eagles retired his number after his career was over, joining Kermit Washington N.B.A star as the only other AU player with that honor.\nFollowing his college career, he played for the Baltimore Bullets of the Eastern Professional Basketball league along with Bill Spivey and Sherman White. Georgetown coach John Thompson said of his ability “The tiny scoring guard Wil Jones could have been great in the N.B.A. Little Wil was a shooter’s shooter, talked a whole lot of trash, and always backed it up.” \nCoaching career.\nRobinson Secondary School.\nFollowing his playing career, he became winning a high school coach for Robinson Secondary School., as the first African American coach in Northern Virginia. According to one journalist he became “the most entertaining coach in the history of Northern Virginia, or of the whole area for that matter.”,\nMaryland Terrapins and University of the District of Columbia.\nAfter a stint as an assistant for Lefty Driesell at Maryland, where he recruited excellent African American players, Jones was named head coach at the University of the District of Columbia in 1979 and won the 1982 Division II national title. Sports Illustrated noted Wil Jones’ recruiting talent, \"In the most amazing recruiting coup the college game has seen in recent years, the coach persuaded 6'11\", 215-pound Earl Jones (no relation), the most highly publicized high school player in the nation last season, to forsake the glamorous heavyweights of Division I for Division II UDC.\" Earl Jones had been recruited by the top programs in the country, but had an uncertain academic future.\nWil Jones is appreciated for hiring NCAA’s first Female Assistant Basketball Coach Cheryl Roberts at UDC in 1981.\nCoach Jones also recruited leaper Michael Britt who teamed with Earl Jones to lead the UDC Firebirds back to back NCAA Division II Final Fours, where they were runners-up in 1983.\nIn 1988, eligibility irregularities were found in Jones' UDC program. The school had to forfeit 11 games for playing an ineligible transfer and he was reassigned and then fired. However, after five years Jones was reinstated as head coach by legal order.\nNorfolk State Spartans.\nIn 1999, Jones moved to Norfolk State, citing a desire to coach at the Division I level. He was head coach for the Spartans for three seasons, compiling a record of 34–52.\nDeath.\nWil Jones died of Pancreatic cancer in Virginia Beach, Virginia on March 12, 2014. John Thompson sums up Wil Jones’ personality and basketball status in the Washington D.C. area when he told Sports Illustrated in 1980, “He was the Muhammad Ali of basketball. He was an extremely confident person on the court, and he could be very aggravating, but I like him.”\nFamily.\nJones' brother Frank Jones, Sr. resides in Maryland. He has one son William S. Jones Jr. and three grandsons (Los Angeles California) and nephews Frank Jones Jr, Frank Jones III, nieces Tia Jones and Kristy Jones of Maryland."

All results from the first qualification round were carried over to the second round. Games were played in September 2018, November 2018 and February 2019. The top three teams in each group along with the better placed fourth team qualified for the FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nThe 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup host, China, was not taken into consideration for qualifying spots.

Early in the game Racing fly-half Pat Lambie was forced off the field with a knee injury, replaced by French international Rémi Talès. Racing recovered from this set back to score the first points of the game with Teddy Iribaren kicking a penalty. Leinster responded on 16 minutes when Johnny Sexton opened their account, also from a penalty. Iribaren reestablished Racing's lead five minutes later and Sexton responded just before half time, to send the teams into the break level on six points apiece. \nThe teams were both unchanged for the second half, and the penalty tit-for-tat continued. Sexton was the first to strike in the second half with a converted effort on 53 minutes, before Iribaren missed and the teams remained level at 9–9 coming into the final 10 minutes of play. Iribaren kicked his fourth penalty of the day to give Racing back their three-point lead, but Leinster responded quickly with a penalty from captain Isa Nacewa. Nacewa scored another penalty with two minutes left to play to give Leinster the lead for the first time in the match. Racing won the kick off and worked down the field, looking for a drop goal to level the match again and bring play to extra time. With clock over 80 minutes the opportunity fell to Talès, who pulled his effort wide to the left to give Leinster their fourth European title."

        "text": "Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami: Bring Your Best Board is a made for television documentary that explores medical errors and waste in healthcare. It was broadcast globally on the Discovery Channel in 2012. It references federally-funded studies in the United States and news footage to support the claim that healthcare workers are afraid to speak up when medical errors occur in hospitals. The documentary covers solutions to preventable system failures causing harm. It aired four times on the Discovery Channel commercial-free in North America, Germany, the U.K., France, and other Western European countries including Sweden. It premiered at the National Press Club on April 27, 2012, after a short speech by Captain Sully Sullenberger who was featured in the film. The film was screened at the Texas Health Care Quality Improvement Awards on May 3, 2012.\nContent and Themes.\nThe film uses examples of the high risk industries of auto racing, aviation, and manufacturing to illustrate dramatically improved safety through the application of best practices. It challenges consumers, caregivers, and governance board members to act. News video footage of \"The Miracle on the Hudson\" flight of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River saving 155 lives is shown, and Sullenberger describes a framework he used in dealing with the crisis that can be applied to healthcare. One example explains that the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville brought in a NASCAR pit crew chief to examine their operating room turnover and received \"great suggestions\" according to the Bob Brigham, COO at Mayo Clinic in Florida.\nDenis Quaid’s Twins Medication Error.\n\"Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami\" includes appearances with actor and patient safety advocate Dennis Quaid who shares how his twins accidentally twice received 1,000 times the dosage of a dangerous blood thinner called Heparin. He reports that his twins are \"doing fine,\" and he hopes to prevent medical errors like theirs by sharing their story. Quaid’s speech at a National Press Club event is presented in which he states that \"the real sweet spot or safety envelope for high-performance care is the intersection of three systems: leadership, safe practices, and technology. When these support systems are functioning within the right organizational culture, we get great care and we get safe care.\" National network news video of interviews of Quaid on CNN, MSNBC, and C-SPAN are included in the film.\nChasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare harm.\nThe documentary references the made for television documentary also broadcast globally in the Discovery Channel, \"\" which used hospital accidents to focus a lens on leaders in healthcare reducing preventable medical error rates to zero. The documentary captures segments of Chasing Zero filmed around the globe at locations including Geneva, Switzerland; London, England; Hawaii; the Brigham and Women’s Hospital; the Cleveland Clinic; Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Johns Hopkins; and the Mayo Clinic.\nEric Cropp and the Death of Emily Jerry.\nThe film covers the death of a 2-year-old girl killed by a preventable and accidental lethal injection of a salt solution during cancer treatment. The father of the child who died, Christopher Jerry, sat with the pharmacist convicted of manslaughter in the death of Emily Jerry, and forgave him on camera. They pledged to work together to prevent this type of error from happening again.\nCommunicating with the News Media.\nThe documentary examines the difficulty the producers had in their efforts to bring attention to system errors in healthcare by showing a clip from their appearance on the MSNBC show \"Morning Joe\" on April 22, 2010. Joe Scarborough attempted to enforce the message that you can not trust healthcare providers by asking, \"you've got to be very skeptical of every doctor and every nurse? You don't want to get in the way of what they're doing, but you just can't take their word for it anymore, can you?\" But the data shows that systems errors are the cause of harm, not individuals.\n\"I Love Lucy\".\n\"Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami\" used the scene from the September 15, 1952, episode of \"I Love Lucy\", \"Job Switching\", as a metaphor for how systems can cause well-meaning and competent caregivers to make errors. In the scene, Lucy and Ethel attempt to keep up with an unmanageable pace of chocolates coming off of an assembly line. When they do well, the manager increases the speed, forcing them to hide their errors. In turn, the manager thinks they can handle the increased speed and increases the speed again, leading to more failures in their work. As Dr. Thomas J. Lee notes, \"Lucy and Ethel must feel the way that contemporary employees feel as they are constantly pushed to produce more and perform better without adequate or appropriate training, support, or understanding.\" This scene has been used in healthcare to represent what happens to frontline healthcare workers, resulting in medical errors.\nGlobal Crisis.\nThe documentary recognized the global impact of medical errors by sharing that in hospitals across Western Europe, North America, and Australia, the chances of being subjected to a medical error in hospital is 1 in 10. The chances of dying from an error is 1 in 300, according to Sir Liam Donaldson of the World Health Organization.\nAviation Safety and Healthcare Comparisons.\nThe documentary interviews several notable people in aviation including Chesley Sullenberger and John J. Nance. They recount that aviation saw that they had system errors that would doom the industry, the industry got together to fix the problems by forming the private-public joint task force, Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST).\nStory Power.\nThe film introduces the concept of Story Power, using patient stories to engage the hearts and minds of medical professionals to change the way they deliver care for the better. This concept is based on the Journal of Patient Safety article, \"Story Power: The Secret Weapon\" by Dennis Quaid, Julie Thao, and Dr. Charles Denham. This section features Patient Safety Advocate and Author, Regina Holliday who encourages patient advocates and healthcare providers to engage patients and their families in dialogue about solutions for healthcare."

Santos and trained by Flint S. \"Scotty\" Schulhofer, won the 1-1/2 mile stakes race in front of a then-record 85,818 crowd, and thus denying Charismatic winning the Triple Crown. \nNear the finish line, Charismatic fractured two bones in his left front leg. He was quickly pulled up by jockey Chris Antley, who dismounted and cradled the leg to prevent further injury.\nRace description.\nCharismatic, who had won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, was made the 3-2 favorite in the Belmont as he attempted to win the Triple Crown. His main rivals were expected to be Menifee (5-2), who had finished second in both the Derby and Preakness, and the filly Silverbulletday (5-1), who had won eight straight races. Lemon Drop Kid, who had finished ninth in the Derby and third in the Peter Pan Stakes, was considered a longshot at odds of nearly 30-1.\nIn the absence of other speed horses, Silverbulletday was expected to set the early pace. Rather than let her get an uncontested lead and perhaps steal the race, Chris Antley on Charismatic decided to press the pace. The two raced heads apart for the first half mile, completed in a relatively fast time of 47 seconds. Silverbulletday then opened up a half length lead before tiring, eventually finishing seventh. Charismatic responded to a challenge from Stephen Got Even around the final turn, and briefly took the lead despite drifting out as they entered the stretch.\nMeanwhile, Lemon Drop Kid rated in eighth place behind the early pace. Around the final turn, he started to make up ground after finding room on the rail. Entering the stretch, he was swung wide by jockey José A. Santos and quickly pulled clear of Charismatic. He then withstood a late run from longshot Vision and Verse to win by a head. Charismatic held on for third but was pulled up quickly after the finish line. It was later determined that Charismatic fractured both the sesamoid and cannon bones in his left front leg. Antley dismounted and held up Charismatic's leg until the track ambulance arrived to van the horse off. \nThe race proved both a low point and highlight in Antley's racing career. In addition to losing a chance to win the Triple Crown, Antley was criticized by some for his racing tactics in pressing the early pace. On the other hand, he earned widespread praise for pulling up Charismatic so quickly: the horse survived his injuries."

        "title": "2017 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2017 Belmont Stakes was the 149th running of the Belmont Stakes and the 106th time the event took place at Belmont Park. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\", is the final jewel in Thoroughbred horse racing's American Triple Crown series. The race was on June 10, 2017, and was broadcast by NBC starting at 5 PM EDT. For the second straight year, the Belmont did not have a Triple Crown at stake, as 2017 Kentucky Derby winner Always Dreaming had lost in the Preakness Stakes. The race was won by Tapwrit.\nField.\nThe connections of both Always Dreaming, the 2017 Kentucky Derby winner, and Cloud Computing, the winner of the 2017 Preakness Stakes, decided to bypass the Belmont. Classic Empire would have been the favorite of the remaining contenders for the race, but was withdrawn on June 7 because of a recurrent foot abscess. Classic Empire, the champion two-year-old colt of 2016, finished fourth in the Derby and second in the Preakness.\nAnother leading contender was Epicharis, a Japanese-bred horse who qualified on the 2017 Road to the Kentucky Derby but who bypassed that race to focus on the Belmont. The New York Racing Association offers a $1-million bonus to any Japan-based horse who wins the Belmont. Epicharis entered a one-week isolation protocol on May 25 and shipped to Belmont Park on June 1. Unfortunately, Epicharis went lame on June 7 and was scratched on June 10 by the state veterinarian. \"He had foot soreness – heel soreness – earlier in the week and he just wasn’t sound\", said Scott Palmer, NYRA's equine medical director. \"In a week maybe he could be ready, but we ran out of time. The right decision was made. The top priority is the horse.\"\nIn their absence, Irish War Cry was made the morning line favorite at odds of 7–2. Irish War Cry won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April and finished tenth in the Kentucky Derby.\nOther confirmed contenders include Tapwrit (Tampa Bay Derby); Gormley (Santa Anita Derby); J Boys Echo (Gotham Stakes); Lookin At Lee (2nd Kentucky Derby); Multiplier (Illinois Derby); Senior Investment (Lexington Stakes); Twisted Tom (Federico Tesio Stakes); Meantime (2nd Peter Pan Stakes); Patch (2nd Louisiana Derby); and Hollywood Handsome (5th Illinois Derby).\nThe post position draw was held on June 7.\nRace description.\nEven though a Triple Crown was not at stake, the race drew a good crowd of 57,729. The start was good, but the field was tightly bunched going into the first turn. At the back of the pack, longshot Hollywood Handsome checked sharply after almost clipping heels with the horses in front of him, causing jockey Florent Geroux to lose his stirrups. Hollywood Handsome raced out of control for nearly a quarter of a mile before Geroux was able to pull him up. The horse was vanned off the racetrack as a safety precaution but suffered only a laceration below the left knee.\nWith no true speed horses in the race, Irish War Cry went to the lead and set a moderate pace. Tapwrit and Gormley raced together just off the pace and made their moves rounding the far turn. Tapwrit had the better acceleration and started closing ground on Irish War Cry down the stretch. As the gap narrowed, Tapwrit drifted out to the center of the track then drifted back towards the rail, brushing lightly with Irish War Cry. In the final strides, Tapwrit pulled clear, ultimately winning by two lengths. Patch closed ground late to beat out Gormley for third.\n\"Tapwrit was getting a beautiful trip\", said Pletcher. \"It was everything we talked about in the paddock before the race. We were hoping he had enough when it came to crunch time. It looked like Irish War Cry still had something left, but the last sixteenth, [Tapwrit] dug down deep.\"\n\"It actually wasn't our plan to be on the lead\", said Graham Motion, the trainer of Irish War Cry. \"We kind of hoped that somebody else would go for it, but he had to go to Plan B and [jockey] Rajiv [Maragh] did a great job.\"\nThe first four finishers had all run in the Derby, then skipped the Preakness. \"We felt like with the five weeks in between, and with the way this horse had trained, that he had a legitimate chance\", said Pletcher, who is based at Belmont Park. \"I think that's always an advantage.\"\nChart.\nTimes: mile – 0:23.88; mile – 0:48.86; mile – 1:14.01; mile – 1:38.95; miles – 2:04.10; final – 2:30.02.&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (:23.88) (:24.78) (:25.35) (:24.94) (:25.15) (:25.92)\nEpicharis (#11) was scratched.\nPayout.\nThe payouts for the Belmont Stakes were as follows:"

It is a day and boarding school similar to its 453-year-old sister school, Rugby School in the UK. Its 80-acre campus (190 rai) is approximately from Bangkok and from Pattaya. Rugby School Thailand offers Britain's national curriculum to both Thai and international students.\nIn September 2017, the Prep and Pre-Prep school opened for Pre-Nursery (2 year-olds) up to Year 6 (10/11 year-olds). Years 7-13 opened in September 2018, with boarding available for Year 3 students and above.\nHistory.\nIn 2015, Nigel Westlake, former headmaster of Packwood Haugh School and Brambletye School, joined with Wisdom Enterprise (owned by the Teepsuwan family) to set up a new international school in Thailand. With over 30 years experience in the UK independent sector, with 15 of those as head, Mr. Westlake serves as the founding headmaster of the new project.\nAfter presenting their plans and receiving positive feedback from 14 schools in the UK, the founders chose to partner with Rugby School \nThe 80-acre campus opened for pre-prep and prep school in September 2017 and opened for senior school in September 2018.\nOn the 12th of September 2021, Rugby School Thailand opened the first 'school sandbox' in Thailand after working with the ISAT to gain approval from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Public Health. This allowed for the reopening of the school amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed students to return to school via a boarding program by taking regular antigen tests and the implementation of rigorous safety measures within the school grounds. Out of 258 international schools in Thailand, the school is only 1 out of 5 that have opened a boarding bubble to offer face-to-face teaching.\nCurriculum.\nRugby School Thailand offers the UK National Curriculum, supplemented by selected components of the British Private School Curriculum, for key stages 0-2 from Pre-Nursery up to Year 6 (ages 2–10).\nIn September 2018, the school opened with 145 students for key stages 3–5 (ages 12–18) and also offer the internationally recognised qualifications IGCSEs, and A-Levels. The school will eventually be able to accommodate roughly 1,250 pupils.\nBoarding.\nBoarding at Rugby School Thailand began in September 2018 and is available to children from years 5–13.\nCurrently, there are three different boarding options:\nFees.\nTuition fees range from 470,000 to 869,000 baht per year. Annual Boarding fees are 248,500 baht for Part Boarding, 364,300 baht for Weekly Boarding and 430,500 baht for Full Boarding.\nCampus.\nAt the 80-acre campus, facilities include:"

As a senior, he was selected for first-team All-America honors by the AP, \"The Sporting News\" and \"Time\".\nIn 1971, then-Stanford coach John Ralston called Parish \"the finest linebacker\" he had ever coached, adding: \"In his three seasons (at Stanford), he has never given anything less than 110-percent effort.\"\nHe suffered from traumatic brain injury during his football days, his brother, Kenneth, told a reporter in 2021.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a first baseman leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. First base, or 1B, is the first of four stations on a baseball diamond which must be touched in succession by a baserunner to score a run for that player's team. A first baseman is the player on the team playing defense who fields the area nearest first base, and is responsible for the majority of plays made at that base. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. Additional modifications were made to first basemen's gloves in the 1930s which further reduced errors. All but one of the top 14 players in career errors began playing in the 19th century, and most played their entire careers before 1900; none were active after 1919. None of the top 20 were active after 1930, and only 10 of the top 64 were active after 1950. The top 48 single-season totals were all recorded before 1900, and the top 179 were recorded before 1920. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill. George Sisler, whose 269 errors are the most by any first baseman whose career began after 1910, is often regarded as the greatest defensive first baseman in history; George Scott, whose 165 errors are the most by an American League first baseman since the Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence were introduced in 1957, won the award eight times – including 1967, when he led the AL with 19 errors.\nCap Anson, whose career began in 1871 and who played nearly 400 more games at first base than any other player in the 19th century, is the all-time leader in career errors as a first baseman with 658, nearly three times as many as any first baseman whose career began after 1920; he also holds the National League record of 583. Dan Brouthers, who played only one game at first base after 1896, is second all-time with 513, and is the only other first baseman to commit more than 500 errors."

In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nBlackburn played , i.e. number 5, in Featherstone Rovers' 12-9 victory over Wakefield Trinity in the 1939–40 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1939–40 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Saturday 22 June 1940.\nTestimonial match.\nBlackburn's benefit season at Featherstone Rovers, shared with Jimmy Russell, took place during the 1951–52 season."

        "text": "The United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) is an organization which offers certification and professional development for professional tennis teachers and tennis coaches. \nHistory.\nIn February 1927 Vincent Richards postulated the idea of there being a professional association for professional players. Later that year it was founded as the Professional Lawn Tennis Association (PLTA) of the United States in November 1927. It later became responsible for the administration of the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, and also officially sanctioned professional tournaments, and pro tennis circuit before the open era. \nIn 1957 its name was changed again to the United States Professional Lawn Tennis Association (USPLTA). In 1969 following the Open era when most players turned professional it moved into training players to be certified instructors. In 1970 the association's name changed to United States Professional Tennis Association.\nThe organization has approximately 13,500 members in the United States, and promotes excellence in the tennis industry.\nThe on-court component of the certification exam, which is offered at various locations across the U.S., requires players to demonstrate proper grip and the ability to hit to specific areas of the court with each stroke.\nThe organization's newsletter, USPTA ADDvantage, offers news, professional development materials, and video for coaches and teaching professionals.\nSince 2006, USPTA has partnered with ThanksUSA for \"Tennis Thanks the Troops\" to raise money for tennis scholarships for US military family members."

Conference play started in late December 2017 and concluded in March with the 2018 ACC men's basketball tournament at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. The Virginia Cavaliers won an outright regular season championship, their third in five years under the guidance of Tony Bennett, who also received his third ACC Coach of the Year Award. He also became the only living three-time winner of the Henry Iba Award for national coach of the year.\nThe Cavaliers finished 17–1 in the conference, finishing four games above second-place Duke. Virginia went on to win the tournament by handily defeating Louisville 75–58, Clemson 64–58, and North Carolina 71–63 in the championship game. Sophomore guard Kyle Guy was named Tournament MVP as well as First-Team All-ACC. Both the Virginia–North Carolina title game and Duke–North Carolina semifinal game set the Barclays Center attendance record for college basketball games, and conference leadership vowed to return the ACC tournament to New York again in the near future.\nHead coaches.\nCoaching changes.\nOn February 16, 2017, NC State head coach Mark Gottfried was fired, but the school allowed him to finish out the season. He finished at NC State with a six-year record of 123–86. On March 17, the school hired UNC Wilmington head coach Kevin Keatts as head coach.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors in New York announced that Louisville was under investigation for an alleged \"pay for play\" scheme involving recruits. The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro. The criminal complaint does not name Louisville specifically but appears to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, a late, surprise commit to the school. On September 27, head coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave.\nCoaches.\n\"Notes:\"\nPreseason.\nPreseason watchlists.\nBelow is a table of notable preseason watch lists. \nACC Preseason Media Poll.\nIn the end of October, 2017 members of the media gathered in Charlotte to vote on the preseason ACC awards. Conference finish, Preseason ACC teams, rookie of the year, and player of the year were all voted on. The results can be seen in the sections below.\nPreseason poll.\nFirst place votes shown in parentheses.\nRegular season.\nConference matrix.\nThis table summarizes the head-to-head results between teams in conference play. Each team will play 18 conference games, and at least 1 against each opponent. \nPlayer of the week.\nThroughout the conference regular season, the Atlantic Coast Conference offices named one or two Players of the week and one or two Rookies of the week.\nRecords against other conferences.\n2017–18 records against non-conference foes as of (Feb. 3, 2018). Records shown for regular season only. \nPostseason.\nACC tournament.\nAP Rankings at time of tournament\nHonors and awards.\nAll-Americans.\nTo earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\n2018 NBA draft.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference had a total of 10 players selected in the 2018 NBA Draft. Six players were selected in the first round, and 4 players were selected in the second round. The 10 selections was the most selections of any conference in the draft. The ACC is the only conference to have had at least four first round picks in each of the last 10 NBA Drafts, and has had at least one first round pick for 30 consecutive years."

This was the first time the final has been held outside one of the Six Nations countries.\nFrench side Stade Français were the reigning champions but failed to progress past the quarter-finals after losing to Newcastle Falcons. Gloucester returned to the final having lost to Stade Français last season, where they faced Cardiff Blues, who made it their first final of any competition since their 2010 European Challenge Cup Final victory. Like then, Cardiff Blues were victorious, defeating Gloucester 31–30 with a 78th-minute penalty by Gareth Anscombe to clinch the title.\nTeams.\n20 teams qualified for the 2017–18 European Rugby Challenge Cup; a total of 18 qualified from across the Premiership, Pro14 and Top 14, as a direct result of their domestic league performance, with two coming through a play-off. The expected distribution of teams is:\nThe following clubs qualified for the Challenge Cup.\n20th team play-off.\nFour clubs competed in a play-off to decide the final team in the Champions Cup. The play-off comprised three matches, contested by one team from the Premiership, one from the Top 14, and two from the Pro14.\nThe two Pro12 teams each played one of the Premiership or Top 14 sides in a single-leg semi-final, held at the home ground of the non-Pro12 side. The winners of these matches then contested a play-off final, with the winner of this match competing in the 2017–18 European Rugby Champions Cup. The three losing teams were all entered in the Challenge Cup.\nThe following teams took part:\nMatches.\nA draw was held on 15 March 2017 to determine the two semi-final matches, and which semi-final's winner would have home advantage in the final.\nSemi-finals\nPlay-off final\nContinental Shield.\nEight teams were split into two pools of four to compete in the re-branded European Rugby Continental Shield. Each team played the four teams in the other pool once. The winner of each pool then played a two-legged final against last year's qualifying sides, and the winners, on aggregate, will take the two remaining places in the Challenge Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower competition.\nTeams will be taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw was used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team went into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determined which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others entered Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Continental Shield, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro12, qualifying teams are automatically included in Tier 4, and are, in effect, seeded equally despite officially being ranked 1/2 from \"that competition\".\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 8 June 2017, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, both at home and away in the group stage, beginning on the weekend of 12/13/14 October 2017, and continuing through to 19/20 January 2018, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams are awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nFormat.\nThe eight qualifiers are ranked according to their performance in the pool stage and compete in the quarter-finals which was held on the weekend of 30/31 March 2018. The four top teams hosted the quarter-finals against the four lower teams in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 20/21/22 April 2018. In lieu of the draw that used to determine the semi-final pairing, EPCR announced that a fixed semi-final bracket would be set in advance, and that the home team would be designated based on \"performances by clubs during the pool stages as well as the achievement of a winning a quarter-final match away from home\".\nHome advantage was awarded as follows:"

Elias Lindholm was caught high-sticking, and the resulting play allowed Ryan O'Reilly to slot in Mitch Marner's rebounded shot.\nThe game remained tied after overtime, meaning the game was decided via a five-round shootout. While William Nylander missed the opening penalty shot, Bäckström and Oliver Ekman-Larsson both scored their shots for Sweden. Canada failed to register a goal, with Henrik Lundqvist preventing four attempted penalty shots from converting. The win enabled Sweden to claim their 10th championship title. Nylander was named tournament Most Valuable Player, with seven goals and seven assists in ten games.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The High Point Panthers women's lacrosse team is an NCAA Division I college lacrosse team representing High Point University as part of the Big South Conference. They play their home games at Vert Stadium in High Point, North Carolina.\nHistory.\nIn September 2008, High Point athletics director Craig Keilitz announced the formation of a women's lacrosse team. A nationwide search was conducted for its first head coach, and Lyndsey Boswell was hired the following summer. Boswell was a 2005 graduate of Pfeiffer, where she was a two-time IWLCA All-American and was the Carolinas-Virginia Athletics Conference player of the year in 2004. Boswell also set program records in goals, assists, and points. She was an assistant coach at Pfeiffer from 2005-06, before landing her first head coaching job at St. Andrews in 2007. From 2007-09, she coached the Knights to an increasing number of wins each year, culminating in 11 in 2009. In June 2009, Boswell became head coach at High Point, and after a year and a half of recruiting, the Panthers' first Division I season was in spring 2011. Through the 2018 season, Boswell has led the team to a 108-46 record, including a 39-4 mark in the Big South.\nThe program has had a successful existence, having reached the conference tournament championship game in either the National Lacrosse Conference or the Big South Conference every year except for 2015. The team won a conference tournament in 2011 and a regular-season championship in 2012 in the National Lacrosse Conference before the league folded. \nIn 2013 the Big South Conference began sponsoring women's lacrosse and was also granted an automatic berth to the NCAA tournament. The Panthers joined the new league and have won the conference tournament in 2013, 2014, and 2017. In 2013, after an 8-8 regular season, High Point won the Big South tournament title, but lost 18-7 to Loyola (MD) in the NCAA tournament. In 2014, for the second straight year, the Panthers scheduled four eventual tournament teams. While they lost all four, the stiff competition prepared them well for the Big South, where they swept the rest of the teams en route to another NCAA tournament appearance, an 18-4 loss to Notre Dame.\n2015 was a rebuilding year for the Panthers, who won just one game on the road en route to an 8-10 record. The team finished fourth in the Big South Conference and lost to Winthrop in the conference tournament semifinal. \nIn 2016, the Panthers finished 13-6, with a quality 15-9 win over No. 21 James Madison, but again ran into Winthrop in the conference tournament championship, losing 7-10.\n2017 saw the Panthers get off to a rough start, falling to eventual NCAA Tournament teams North Carolina, Elon, and James Madison. However, the Panthers regained their footing by winning their last six nonconference games. Led by five players who scored 38+ goals, the Panthers swept through the Big South regular season and captured the conference tournament championship, outscoring every opponent by 7+ goals. The program garnered its first NCAA tournament win (and the first in High Point Panthers history) by defeating Towson, 21-15. The team then faced top-seeded Maryland, where they lost 6-21, ending a team record 16-game win streak.\nIn 2018, led by Tewaaraton Award Watch List nominee Erica Perrotta, and freshman Abby Hormes, who scored 59 goals, the Panthers returned to the NCAA tournament. After two early losses to eventual top-3 seeds UNC and James Madison, the Panthers rattled off sixteen straight wins, including triumphs over at the time #21 Notre Dame and #19 Duke. The Panthers rose as high as #16 in the national rankings before a 19-10 first-round defeat to Denver in the NCAA tournament.\nIn 2019, led by Big South Offensive Player of the year Abby Hormes the Panthers won their 3rd straight Big South Championship. The season started with a few notable losses to #2 UNC 9-13, #7 JMU 5-12, and #16 Florida 15-16. The season took a big turn after toppling #14 Johns Hopkins 13-10, which is the highest ranked win against a top 25 team in program history. High Point ranked as high as #20 in the national rankings. The panthers would go on to the NCAA tournament where they had a first round loss to #14 Navy 16-5.\nThe 2020 Season had high hopes as the Panthers were pre season Big South favorites. High Point got off to a good start before hitting a wall going up against #1 UNC losing 24-3. Then falling to #17 JMU 13-8, and #5 Florida 17-10 which was the last game of the season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. High Point also ranked as high as #20 in the nation during the brief 2020 season.\nIn 2021, the Panthers led by Big South Offensive player of the year Senior Abby Hormes. High Point had a heartbreaking loss in OT to #11 JMU 9-10. High Point would go on to have a 10-8 season. High Point went on to win the Big South Tournament and play in the NCAA tournament where they ended their season to defending national champions Maryland 6-17. \n2022 saw the Panthers get off to really rough start going 0-5 and in that stretch dropping to #6 Duke 13-22. They also lost to #1 UNC 9-23. However, they turned the season around with the help of Abby Hormes having a career season. The Panthers went on a 8 game win streak to end the regular season as the Big South tournament #1 seed. The Panthers finished the season with a 10-9 record. The season ended as the panthers were upset in the Big South Championship by #2 Mercer 13-16. Abby Hormes set the NCAA all time single season goal scoring record scoring her 103 goal.\nThe team partners with the Friends of Jaclyn Foundation, which is \"an organization created to encourage NCAA athletic programs to sponsor pediatric brain tumor patients\".

In 1992, it had originally lost to ÍFL in the playoff final, 97–49, but due to ÍFL using an illegal player against Bolungarvík during the group stage, the final had to be replayed.

In the rematch, Gnúpverjar lost again, this time 68–54.\nAfter years of hiatus, the team was resurrected in 2015 and rapidly moved up the Icelandic basketball league pyramid, winning Division III in its ignaural season in 2016 and finishing second in Division II in 2017 and achieving promotion to Division I.

        "title": "Chris Boucher (basketball)",
        "text": "Christopher Boucher (born January 11, 1993) is a Canadian-Saint Lucian professional basketball player who plays for the Toronto Raptors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in Saint Lucia, he played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks.\nEarly life.\nBoucher was born in Castries, Saint Lucia. He moved with his mother, Mary McVane, to Montreal when he was five years old to see his Canadian father, Jean-Guy Boucher. However, his parents split up when he was young and Boucher had a poor relationship with his father. He grew up playing soccer and ice hockey but lived in poverty in the Montréal-Nord neighbourhood. He dropped out of high school at age 16 and worked as a cook and dishwasher in a St-Hubert restaurant. In 2012, he was offered a spot on a tournament basketball team, and scored 44 points in the tournament final. Boucher, who previously only played pickup basketball, was offered a spot on Amateur Athletic Union AAU team Alma Academy by coaches Igor Rwigema and Ibrahim Willson. He accepted a spot at the Academy, which was created to help inner-city teenagers with few future prospects, to earn a high school diploma. In a game versus New Jersey's Blair Academy, Boucher scored 29 points and 12 rebounds, attracting the interest of Division I college coaches.\nCollege career.\nBoucher played one season at New Mexico Junior College, averaging 11.9 points and 6.7 rebounds per game. Then, he went to Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, where he was named NJCAA Player of the Year after leading the team to a 31–5 record. That season, he shot 62.7% from inside the arc and 44.4% from three-point range, averaging 22.5 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 4.7 blocks per game. His 11.8 rebounds per game were fifth-best in junior college that season, while his 4.7 blocks per game were good for third-best. Following a campus visit, Boucher transferred to Oregon, which he chose over TCU, Minnesota and Texas Tech.\nAt the beginning of his first year at the University of Oregon, he worried Ducks coach Dana Altman due to his thin physique but made up for it with his energy. In his second game in a Ducks uniform on November 16, 2015, Boucher was competing against Baylor's Rico Gathers, and Boucher scored 15 points and gathered eight rebounds. He set a single-season blocks record for Oregon with 110. Boucher recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and two steals in the Ducks' 80–68 loss to Oklahoma in the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament. Following the 2015–16 season he was granted a hardship waiver to play an extra season and complete his sociology degree. He averaged 12.0 points and 6.8 rebounds in his two-year career for the Ducks. As a senior, he was named to the Pac-12 Defensive Team after leading the conference in blocks with 2.6 per game. Boucher scored 23 points and a career-high 19 rebounds against Montana in December 2016. In the Pac-12 tournament semifinals against California on March 10, 2017, an opposing player fell on Boucher's leg awkwardly, but he continued to play and finished the game with 10 points and four rebounds. The following day, an MRI scan revealed a torn ACL and he was ruled out for the remainder of the season.\nProfessional career.\nGolden State Warriors (2017–2018).\nPrior to the 2017 NBA draft, Boucher was unable to work out with teams due to his injury. He ultimately went undrafted, but was signed by the Golden State Warriors to a two-way contract, the same team which purchased a draft pick from the Chicago Bulls to choose his Oregon teammate Jordan Bell. Boucher became one of the first players to sign up on the NBA's newest two-way contract policy, which went into effect that season, although his deal was not official until July 14, 2017. On November 2, 2017, Boucher was called up to the NBA G League by the Santa Cruz Warriors and made his debut versus the Reno Bighorns. On March 14, 2018, Boucher made his NBA debut, being called up by the Golden State Warriors to fill in for the injury-riddled lineup. In his first and only minute of action with Golden State, he recorded 1 rebound and 1 three-point attempt in a 117-106 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. Although he was unavailable to play in the playoffs due to his two-way contract, Boucher was a part of the Warriors championship team after they swept the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games in the 2018 NBA Finals. On June 22, 2018, the Golden State Warriors waived Boucher.\nToronto Raptors (2018–present).\nOn July 20, 2018, Boucher signed with the Toronto Raptors as a free agent for two years worth just over $2 million. On October 26, 2018, the Raptors converted Boucher's contract to an NBA two-way contract. Boucher played 28 games with the Raptors' NBA G League affiliate, the Raptors 905 where he averaged 27.2 points, 11.4 rebounds, &amp; 4.1 blocks, while also shooting 51.0% from the field. Boucher was named the G League 2018–19 Most Valuable Player and the league's Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the first player to win both awards concurrently, and the first international player to win the league MVP award. Additionally, Boucher was also named to the All-NBA G League First Team. On February 10, 2019, the Raptors signed Boucher to a standard NBA contract. The Raptors made it to the 2019 NBA Finals where they defeated Boucher's former team, the Golden State Warriors. In doing so, Boucher became the first (and so far only) Canadian player to win an NBA title with the NBA's lone Canadian based franchise.\nOn November 10, 2019, Boucher tied his career high in points by scoring 15 points in a Raptors win over LeBron James and the Lakers. On December 22, 2019, Boucher scored 21 points, and set a new career high in the Raptors 110–107 win over the Dallas Mavericks. Three days later, on December 25, 2019, Boucher set a new career high again with 24 points in a 118–102 loss to the Boston Celtics. On March 3, 2020, he set a career high in rebounds with 15 in a win against the Phoenix Suns. On August 10, 2020 in the Orlando bubble, Boucher scored a career-high 25 points against the Milwaukee Bucks. \nOn November 25, 2020, Boucher re-signed with the Raptors for two years worth $13.5 million. On December 26, 2020, Boucher had 22 points, 10 rebounds, and a career-high seven blocks against the San Antonio Spurs. On January 14, 2021, Boucher tied a career-high 25 points against the Charlotte Hornets. On February 6, 2021, Boucher hit another scoring high with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 2 blocks in a loss to the Atlanta Hawks. On March 4, 2021, Boucher had a then season-high 30 points and five rebounds in a 132–125 loss to the Boston Celtics. Then, on April 8, 2021, he hit another scoring high with 38 points, a career-high 19 rebounds and one assist in a 122–113 loss against the Bulls. On April 18, 2021, Boucher scored 31 points with 12 rebounds, two assists, one steal and one block and hit a career-high six threes in a 112–106 win against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nOn June 30, 2022, Boucher re-signed with the Raptors on a three-year, $35.25 million deal. With the trade of Pascal Siakam on January 17, 2024, Boucher became the final remaining player from the 2019 championship team on the Raptors roster.\nCareer statistics.\nCollege.\n\"College statistics only available for final two years at Oregon.\"\nExternal links.\n "

        "title": "Basketball in Argentina",
        "text": "Basketball was introduced in Argentina in 1912 by the \"Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes\" (YMCA), with the first Federation created in 1921 to organise the competitions. In 1929, the Argentine Basketball Confederation (\"Confederación Argentina de Basketball\") was established. The body currently controls the Argentina national team.\nThe Campeonato Argentino de Clubes was the top clubs competition of Argentina until 1984 when the Liga Nacional was created as the request of León Najnudel. The league is controlled by the \"Asociación de Clubes de Básquetbol\"\nRegarding the national team, Argentina is the only national team in the FIBA Americas zone that has won the quintuplet crown: FIBA World Cup (they won the first edition, in 1950), Olympic Gold Medal (2004) (the higher honor and most important title in the history of the national team), FIBA Diamond Ball (2008), FIBA AmeriCup (2001, 2011 and 2022) and Pan American Gold Medal (1995 and 2019). They have also won 13 South American Basketball Championships, as well as many youth championships.\nThe Argentine representative was also the first to defeat a United States national team with a full squad of NBA players. They did so by 87–80 in the 2002 FIBA World Championship held in Indianapolis.\nHistory.\nBeginning and consolidation.\nThe practice of basketball in Argentina was started by \"Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (YMCA)\" in 1912. Canadian Professor Paul Phillip was in charge to teach basketball at YMCA headquarters in Paseo Colón Avenue, Buenos Aires.\nThe first basketball clubs in Argentina were YMCA, Hindú and Independiente. By 1912 the first basketball games were held by YMCA headquarters in Buenos Aires. In 1913 the first games between Argentine and Uruguayan YMCA are played. One year later, the YMCA organised the first internal championship. In 1919 the Uruguay national team played a game v. local team Nacional, in Buenos Aires. \nIn 1921 the \"Argentine Basketball Federation\" (original name: \"Federación Argentina de Basket-Ball\" – FABB) was established to organise competitions not only in Buenos Aires but in several cities around Argentina, such as Bahía Blanca and Córdoba where basketball would develop significantly in successive years. Argentina played its first international game (representing the FABB) against Uruguay in 1921. The players chosen to play that match were: S.G. Romero, J.C. Rodríguez Quiroga (captain), A. Birba, M. Hernandorena, J. Barbier.\nThe first \"big\" of Argentine basketball was Hindú, winning 5 consecutive titles (1922–26). In 1926 the team toured on Europe to play a series of friendly matches. Hindú played a total of 6 games, remaining unbeaten.\nIn successive years, other clubs such as Ñaró, Estudiantes (LP), River Plate, Gimnasia y Esgrima, Universitario and Racing) registered their teams to the Federation. In 1928, the \"Campeonato Argentino de Básquet\" was created\n The competition was established in 1928 with the purpose of organising a competition for provincial representatives. Until then, there was only local leagues such as Torneo Metropolitano, where teams of Buenos Aires took part.\nThe first edition of Campeonato Argentino was held in the clay court field of YMCA of Buenos Aires. Santa Fe, Córdoba and two teams from FABB took part of the tournament. Córdoba was the first team outside Buenos Aires to win a championship, in 1932 and 1933. Other provincial sides such as Santa Fe (1934-1935) and Santiago del Estero (1937, with Rafael Lledó as notable player) would win their first national titles also.\nBuenos Aires Province was the most winning team between 1966 and 1978, with Bahiense players Alberto Pedro Cabrera, Atilio Fruet and José De Lizaso, plus other players from La Plata, Gehrmann, Galliadi, Sfeir, Carlos González. Buenos Aires played 13 consecutive finals, winning 10 of them.\nOn August 30, 1929, the Argentine Basketball Federation (current \"Confederación Argentina\") was established, with founder members from Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fe, La Rioja, North Federation and Bahía Blanca. The Federación Argentina focused on the spread of basketball in Buenos Aires as in the rest of the provinces of Argentina.\nClub competitions, 1936-1984.\nThe Campeonato Argentino was the first club competition in Argentina, where the champions of each region took part. The first edition was held in 1936, being won by Huracán (Rosario). The last edition of Campeonato Argentino was held in 1984 and won by Deportivo San Andrés, a club from General San Martín Partido, after defeating River Plate at the finals. Obras Sanitarias was the most winning team with 3 championships (1975, 1976, 1982).\nSome of the most notable players during those years were Atilio Fruet, José De Lizaso and Alberto Cabrera, who played for \"Bahiense\" teams Olimpo and Estudiantes respectively. They were nicknamed \"The Three Musketeers of basketball\" in the 1960s. Because of their contributions, Bahía Blanca was regarded as \"the capital city of Argentine basketball\".\nIn 1984 the competition was replaced by the Liga Nacional de Básquet.\nInception of Liga Nacional.\nThe Liga Nacional de Básquet was created through the efforts of basketball coach León Najnudel, and sports journalist Osvaldo Orcasitas, in the 1980s, to make Argentine men's club basketball more competitive, through the merging of the many existing local leagues. It is designed like the NBA, with a regular season, all-star game, and playoffs. However, unlike the NBA, the LNB has a promotion and relegation system, with the Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA), the league level that is immediately below the LNB.\nBefore the league was established, the regular tournament was Campeonato Argentino de Clubes where teams from all the provinces took part. The league had a regional format and playoffs.\nFor the 1984 edition there was 64 teams. The association decided to retire 10 teams, moving them to \"Primera Nacional A\". Of those teams, 4 were from city of Buenos Aires, and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Santa Fe were represented by 2 teams each.\nFerro Carril Oeste was the first LNB champion after defeating Atenas de Córdoba in 3 games. The next season (1986), Ferro Carril Oeste won its second consecutive title, beating Olimpo de Bahía Blanca in 5 games (3-1 on aggregate). The \"Verdolaga\" played its third consecutive final series in 1987, but was finally defeated by Atenas, that won the first of 9 titles, being the most winning LNB team to date.\nIn 1988 Atenas won a second championship beating River Plate and the next year Ferro won another title, being the only title won by León Najnudel as coach. Atenas won a total of 9 LNB titles, being the most winning team since the inception of the league in 1985.\nIn the 2011–12 season a third level of competition, the \"Torneo Federal de Básquetbol\", was created. The Federal encompassed a wide array of teams from all over the country, being organized by the Argentine Basketball Confederation.\nLeague system.\nFollowing a system similar to the European basketball leagues, there are two levels of competition: the Liga Nacional (LNB, first division) and Liga Argentina (formerly, \"Torneo Nacional de Ascenso\" – TNA, \"National Promotion Tournament\" in English, the second division). Both tournaments feature promotions and relegations and are organized by the \"Asociación Argentina de Clubes\" (Argentine Clubs Association).\nCompetitions.\nSince the first tournament held in 1921, many competitions have been held in Argentine basketball. The list includes the following championships:"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career fielding errors as a catcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, an error is an act, in the judgment of the official scorer, of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a batter or baserunner to advance one or more bases or allows an at bat to continue after the batter should have been put out. The catcher is a position for a baseball or softball player. When a batter takes his/her turn to hit, the catcher crouches behind home plate, in front of the (home) umpire, and receives the ball from the pitcher. In addition to these primary duties, the catcher is also called upon to master many other skills in order to field the position well. The role of the catcher is similar to that of the wicket-keeper in cricket. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the catcher is assigned the number 2.\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century, when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. Other protective equipment for catchers was also gradually introduced; the first masks were developed in the late 1870s, with improvements in the 1890s, but shin guards were not introduced to the major leagues until 1907. The top 15 players in career errors all played primarily in the 19th century, and half of the top 52 played their entire careers prior to 1894; only five were active after 1920, and none were active after 1931. To a large extent, the leaders reflect longevity rather than lower skill; of the six catchers in the top 100 who were active after 1960, most were winners of Gold Glove Awards; Bob Boone, who leads all post-1931 catchers with 178 errors, won seven Gold Glove Awards for defensive excellence.\nPop Snyder, who retired in 1891 with a record 877 games as a catcher, is the all-time leader in career fielding errors by a catcher with 685, nearly four times as many as any catcher who began their career after 1915. Deacon McGuire, who ended his career in 1912 with a record 1,612 games caught, is second with 577, and is the only other catcher to commit more than 500 errors. Yadier Molina, who had 80 errors through the 2021 season to place him tied for 210th all-time, is the leader among active players."

        "title": "Baseball law",
        "text": "Baseball law refers to the various civil statutes, local ordinances, and court decisions pertaining to the game of baseball and its institutions, as distinguished from the Rules of Baseball, which are a private codification of rules governing the internal workings of baseball games.\nNineteenth-century baseball law.\nBoth the early rules (which act as the laws of the game) and the legal cases surrounding the sport impact the way baseball is played to this day. Documentation of early baseball law exists but has been rarely studied. Nonetheless its presence in legal disputes and records indicate that it was an important part of American life before 1900. In fact, references to baseball are present in 168 legal cases decided before the turn of the twentieth century.\n\"Blue\" laws.\nIn America's past, \"blue\" laws prohibited business from taking place on the Sabbath. This was an issue for baseball teams who were playing for spectators on Sundays. On April 30, 1891, Tim O'Rourk and 19 others were the subject of a criminal complaint that pertained to them playing baseball for an audience of about 3,000 in Lincoln Park the previous Sunday. The case of \"State v. O'Rourk\" ensued.\nIt was illegal at the time for anyone over age 14 \"engage in sporting\" on a Sunday. The penalty for which was \"a fine of $20, incarceration for 20 days, or both.\" The accused argued that baseball did not fall under the category of \"sport\" and that they were remotely located enough so as not to have offended those observing the Sabbath. The presiding judge dismissed the case on those grounds. However, Chief Justice Maxwell of the Nebraska Supreme Court disagreed.\nThis case showed that there was a growing class of people willing to depart from tradition and attend a baseball game on a Sunday. It also indicates that there were those who adamantly resisted such change.\nStar players.\n\"Free agency\" did not exist as it does today in baseball until the 1970s. Instead, players were bound to their teams by something called the \"reserve clause\". John \"Monte\" Ward was the first to oppose this in November 1889. He was a star player for the National League's New York Giants, but was also an author and lawyer.\nThe \"reserve\" clause did not specify terms of contract, salary or agreements between player and teams. A judge ultimately ruled that with such fundamental questions left unanswered, the clause could not reasonably be enforced.\nThis was the first case of many that ruled in favor of the individual player rather than the team. It allowed star players more choices and the ability to use competition to increase their value.\nBaseball Rule.\nIn 1913 a Missouri appeals court heard \"Crane v. Kansas City Baseball &amp; Exhibition Co.\", a tort case where a spectator at a Kansas City Blues game who had been struck and injured by a foul ball alleged the team had been negligent. But since he had chosen to sit in an unprotected area of the park, even though tickets were general admission and seats were available behind the backstop, the court held for the team per the contributory negligence and assumption of risk doctrines.\nThis holding was adopted by courts hearing similar cases in other states, and by the 1920s it had understood that as long as teams made enough protected seats available to meet reasonably anticipated demand, they had met their duty of reasonable care to spectators and could not be held liable for most foul ball injuries to them. Now known as the Baseball Rule, this holding remains good law in many states today, even after comparative negligence became the primary doctrine of tort law in most states. In the 21st century, it has come under increasing criticism as outdated both legally and in relation to baseball.\n\"Jim Crow\" ball.\nHispanic, black and white Americans have all played baseball since the sport began. In the early days of the sport, integrated teams were not uncommon, with players of color able to play alongside their white counterparts.\nHowever, dating back to as early as 1867, the racism of the post-Civil War era crept into the national pastime. Jim Crow laws were present from Reconstruction into the 1960s and in some instances applied directly to baseball, relegating black players to the Negro leagues while whites played in Major League Baseball. However, segregation in MLB began to end with the signing and debut of Jackie Robinson with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.\nLawlessness.\nIt cannot be denied that early baseball law was lax compared to the standards of today. As with so many other examples, the development of baseball law mirrors the arc of America's history at large. Numerous assaults and \"battings,\" (wherein the batter would beat the pitcher with the baseball bat when he was struck by a pitch) as they were called, led baseball to be nicknamed the \"Wild West Activity.\" Despite the many cases and legal examples, historians Robert M. Jarvis and Phyllis Coleman have suggested that \"early baseball was a lawless place, just like America itself.\"\nBaseball and the legal profession.\nBaseball is highly legalistic, as It is governed by an elaborate set of rules. At the professional level, a highly trained multi-judge panel of umpires must implement and interpret the rules. Offensive and defensive plays require rulings by the umpires These include when a pitch is thrown and when a ball is hit. These plays are legal rulings of the game and become part of the official record. Just like the American legal system, each umpire presides over a jurisdiction. The home plate umpire rules a fair or foul ball before it reaches a base. The first or third base umpire makes a call once the ball in play is beyond their bag. In the World Series, extra umpires are present on the field. This creates a mini-Supreme Court or superior court, which provides new pairs of eyes to scrutinize plays in the outfield.\nInnumerable American lawyers and judges have played baseball – amateur or professional – since the game coalesced in the 19th century. Perhaps the iconic legal publication regarding baseball is the article \"The Common Law Origins of the Infield Fly Rule\", written by Philadelphia attorney William S. Stevens and published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review in 1975.\nFive of Major League Baseball's ten Commissioners of Baseball have been lawyers: \nMajor league managers who are known to have attended law school: \nMLB players who practiced law after their playing careers: "

        "title": "Dylan Cozens (baseball)",
        "text": "Dylan Wallace Cozens (pronounced KUH-zins; born May 31, 1994) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He was a second round pick (77th overall) in the 2012 MLB draft. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies.\nEarly life.\nCozens was born in Scottsdale, Arizona. His father Randy played football for four years as a defensive lineman at the University of Pittsburgh, and was drafted in the 17th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos, but never played for them.\nCozens initially attended Desert Mountain High School in Arizona, but was suspended midway through his junior year for an altercation with his baseball coach. Baseball writer Keith Law reported that Cozens \"shoved his coach and told him to 'f off' in the dugout during a game, so he was kicked off the team - the culmination of a series of incidents that turned many scouts off him, one even calling him a 'bully'\".\nThat led to Cozens transferring to Chaparral High School. Due to his transfer, Cozens was forced to sit out the rest of his junior season due to eligibility restrictions. As a senior, Cozens posted a .520 batting average, and hit 19 home runs, in 33 games, breaking the school's single-season record, formerly held by longtime Chicago White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko. His 19 home runs led the state and were second nationally only to the 21 hit by future major leaguer Joey Gallo. He ended the season by hitting a walk-off home run in the bottom of the seventh inning of the Division I state championship, winning the title. He played that season alongside future Team Israel outfielder/first baseman Jeremy Wolf.\nCozens' also was a standout defensive end on Chaparral's football team and verbally committed to play for the Arizona Wildcats football team before opting to sign with the Phillies.\nCareer.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nAs a scout for the Philadelphia Phillies, Marti Wolever, among other representatives of the organization, evaluated Cozens before the 2012 MLB draft and watched him during a workout at Citizens Bank Park. Though there were some concerns about Cozens’ temperament, the Phillies selected him in the second round with the 77th overall selection of the draft, and he signed a contract with a $659,800 signing bonus. \"That was probably the guy I was most excited about\", said Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro Jr., \"Extraordinary power for a kid -- great body, runs well, seems to move pretty well\".\nCozens began the season with the Gulf Coast Phillies of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. In 50 games, he batted .255 with five home runs and 24 runs batted in (RBIs). The Phillies promoted Cozens to the Williamsport Crosscutters of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League the following year. He finished the season second in the league in doubles (19), extra base hits (30), and runs (50) while also ranking third in slugging percentage (.469). Cozens struck out 147 times in his first full season of professional baseball for the Lakewood BlueClaws of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 2015, he shared time with the Blueclaws and the Reading Fightin' Phils of the Class AA Eastern League.\nDuring the Fightin Phils' season, Cozens hit 40 home runs, the most by any Eastern Leaguer since Ron Kittle in , topping the team's single-season record set by Darin Ruf four years prior, and earning him the Joe Bauman Home Run Award for the most home runs on the season by a minor leaguer; he led the league in runs scored (106), extra-base hits (81), total bases (308), doubles (38), RBIs (125) and slugging percentage (.591). His production helped the team finish with a league-best 89-52 record. However, Cozens batted just .197 off left-handed pitching, and struggled to make contact, striking out a league-leading 186 times, in 521 at-bats. MLB.com ranked him as the seventh-best prospect in the Phillies farm system and the Phils added Cozens to their 40-man roster.\nCozens spent the season with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League, where he struggled to make contact consistently; Cozens batted .210, with 27 home runs, and 75 RBIs, but led the league with 194 strikeouts. He was named an International League All Star.\nThe emergence of Rhys Hoskins and Cozens' high strikeout ratio dashed his opportunity to obtain a spot on the Phillies' Opening Day roster, in 2018. He began the 2018 season with Lehigh Valley, with whom he batted .246/.345/.529 with 21 home runs (tied for 3rd in International League), and 58 RBIs, in 348 at bats. Cozens was the International League Batter of the Week and Phillies Minor League Player of the Week for July 23–29.\nIn 2019 Cozens started the season with Lehigh Valley, but his season was believed to have ended early due to foot surgery in May to remove a bone spur and repair cartilage in his left big toe. He batted .167/.333/.462 with six home runs and five steals in 78 at bats before he was injured. He was designated for assignment by the Phillies on July 31.\nMajor leagues.\nCozens was promoted to the Major Leagues on May 31, 2018, to replace Hoskins while he was on the disabled list. Cozens debuted on June 1, against the San Francisco Giants and recorded his first major league hit in the same game, hitting a single on the first pitch he saw (becoming the first Phillie to get his first major league hit on the first pitch he saw since Steve Montgomery on June 11, 1999). Cozens hit his first big league home run on June 7 against Chicago Cubs reliever Brandon Morrow. He was recalled as a September call up (when MLB rosters expanded), on September 1. In 2018, Cozens batted .158/.273/.289 in 38 at bats for the Phillies with a home run, a stolen base, and two RBIs.\nIn 2019 Cozens batted .167/.333/.462 with six home runs and 15 RBIs and 42 strikeouts in 78 at bats for Lehigh Valley, and had one hitless at bat for the Phillies, before he was injured and ultimately designated for assignment on July 31. He was released on August 1.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn August 10, 2019, Cozens signed a two-year minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Rays and was assigned to the AAA Durham Bulls, and was placed back on the injured list. He returned to action on a four-game rehab assignment with the GCL Rays on August 22, then returned from the injured list on August 31, debuting for Durham the following day and playing two games with them.\nCozens did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. He became a free agent on November 2, 2020.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 17, 2020, Cozens signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers organization.\nCozens announced his retirement on June 22, 2021, in order to pursue a career in professional football. He stated that he was going to \"chase my dream of playing in the NFL (National Football League)\". Cozens worked out for the New England Patriots on August 5, 2021."

        "title": "2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Final was the last match of the 2017 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup which took place on May 7, 2017 at the National Beach Soccer Arena in Nassau, the Bahamas. The final was contested between Tahiti, who had previously competed in one World Cup final, the last World Cup final in 2015 which they lost to Portugal, and Brazil, who were back into a World Cup final after their last appearance six years ago in 2011, their sixth FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup final and their 15th overall when taking into account the pre-FIFA era \"Beach Soccer World Championships\", beating the defending champions Portugal on their way to this year's final.\nBrazil competently won the final by 6 unanswered goals to win their fifth FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and 14th world title overall since 1995, their first title for eight years since defeating Switzerland in the 2009 final. This condemned Tahiti to two successive World Cup final losses and the islanders became only the second team ever to fail to score in a World Cup final after Uruguay in 1996.\nBackground.\nGoing into the match, Tahiti were still a relatively new beach soccer nation having only first competed in 2006 and at their first World Cup in 2011, however had gained experience and solidified their place as a top team having reached three consecutive World Cup semi finals in doing so at this year's tournament and now two consecutive World Cup finals too after losing to hosts Portugal 5–3 in the last occurring World Cup final, in 2015. Tahiti were also world ranked 6th prior to the match.\nComparatively, Brazil have dominated the international beach soccer scene since the start of the World Championships in 1995 and until 2009 appeared in 13 of the 15 finals played (4 of 5 FIFA finals), winning all 13. However since then the Brazilian team have experienced a gradual decline at the World Cups, losing in a final for the first time in 2011 at the hands of Russia, only reaching the semi-finals in 2013 and most notably, for the first time ever, not even finishing in a top 4 position in 2015, losing in the quarter-finals. However since losing that match in 2015 Brazil have been on a 34 match winning streak in all competitions leading up to this match, their first final in six years, finally ending their final drought. Brazil were world ranked 3rd prior to the match.\nBefore the final, the teams had met on three previous occasions, twice at the World Cup, first in 2013 and at this very World Cup as they were both in Group D. The three meetings are documented in the below table:\nPrevious matches\nMatch details.\nSummary.\nWith 2,000 \"Tiki Toa\" fans gathered in front of a giant screen back home in Tahiti, Brazil's Mauricinho opened the scoring after a mere 14 seconds following intercepting Zaveroni's misplaced pass, finishing through the legs of Torohia, and then assisted Datinha to comfortably take a 2–0 lead into the break after the first period. Despite opportunities for Tahiti and a considerable amount of ball possession, Brazil's defence stood firm and limited the shots on target for the islanders, preventing a golden chance for Zavaroni being converted.\nPressing the ball and hitting on the counter attack saw Brazil take further control at the halfway stage of the match in the second period as Mauricinho converted another for a brace to score the only goal of the second set of 12 minutes. Tahiti and Brazil both hit the crossbar but although wayward marking in the Tahitian defence presented a number of chances for Brazil and the islanders also tested goalkeeper Mão, both teams failed to register any new goals on the scoreboard.\nDespite Tahiti's Heimanu hitting the post and Labaste striking the crossbar in the opening moments of the final 12 minutes, and surviving some defensive mistakes, \"Les Tiki Toa\" finally found themselves exposed and tiring at the back in the third period as Catarino scored a left-footed drive off the post on the counter attack once more to make the score 4–0. As Daniel scored a brace minutes later, first a header from a corner and the second finishing in the top corner from a loose ball at the edge of the Tahitian penalty area, Brazil's lead amassed in 29 minutes at 3–0 was doubled to 6–0 in just 4 minutes as the flood gates opened. The Brazilians went on to see out the final minutes to ease to another world title, the 100th international beach soccer trophy in their history.\nPost-match quotes.\nBrazilian captain Bruno Xavier:\n\"I'm very proud to be a part of it. We are more than a group of players, of men, we are a team that gave the life for this title to honor the name of our country. We are Brazil, we are five-time champions of the world, I am very happy that we can take that conquest back to our country\"\nScorer of Brazil's first and third goals, Mauricinho:\n\"It still hasn’t sunk in, to be honest it’s a dream come true. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt about playing beach soccer and being a world champion. To do that, and also win the silver ball is a dream come true.\"\nTahitian goalkeeper, Jonathan Torohia:\n\"They were a step above us for sure. For us, we didn't start well, so at the start of the match we weren't confident. It was really hard. Brazil deserve the World Cup.\"\n\"It's difficult. Two times we have lost the final of a World Cup. But today there are no regrets from us. Brazil was too strong. Even if we made some mistakes. In one year they played so many matches and never lost. We are happy. Brazil stopped us and they were the only team who beat us.\"\nDetails.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 2010 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 27th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2010 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 6, 2010, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky with a purse of $5,000,000. In a highly publicized race, the mare Zenyatta was attempting to defend her victory in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic and retire undefeated. Running well behind in the early portion of the race, she made a sustained drive but came up a head short of the winner, Blame.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nMany horsemen and handicappers considered the 2010 field to be one of the best ever assembled, including the top three-year-olds and older horses. \"I would imagine that when this race was designed, when they came up with the concept in 1982, this is what they had in mind\", said trainer Todd Pletcher. \"It brings the best horses in the world together, on a neutral playing field, on a traditional dirt surface. We'll see what happens.\"\nOne of the most popular horses in recent memory, Zenyatta came into the Classic as the even-money favorite off of a nineteen race win streak. However, there were several factors that made her vulnerable in the race. She had only raced against male horses once, in the 2009 Breeders' Cup Classic, and the field for the 2010 renewal was considered to be much deeper. She had raced almost exclusively in California and on synthetic dirt surfaces, and it was unknown how she would respond to traveling across country and racing at Churchill Downs.\nThe leading contenders included:\nUnlike the years before, there were no entries from Europe, largely due to the change to a traditional dirt surface that favored North American runners compared to the synthetic dirt surface over which the race was run in 2008 and 2009. Espoir City entered from Japan but was given little chance by the bettors.\nRace description.\nQuality Road and First Dude went to the early lead, setting moderate opening fractions. Blame settled in the middle of the pack, while Zenyatta trailed far behind. Her stride was uneven —– \"like a rocking horse\", according to \"The New York Times\" —– and she took some time to settle. Around the far turn, both Blame and Zenyatta started to close ground. Blame, much closer to the pace and benefiting from a perfect trip, reached the lead by mid-stretch and looked likely to win. Zenyatta had been moving fast but faced a wall of horses in front of her. Jockey Mike Smith moved her out wide then made several more adjustments before the mare was able to find running room. In deep stretch, she started to close ground rapidly but came up a neck short. After the race, Smith was in tears, blaming himself for the defeat. \"I got away slow and got squeezed out of there,\" he said. \"I couldn't level her off. If you have to blame anyone today, it would be me.\"\nBlame's Classic victory was the first for trainer Albert Stall and owners Adele Dilschneider and Claiborne Farm, which was celebrating its 100th anniversary. \"I'm still pinching myself\", said Dilschneider. \"I've been involved with the Hancock family for years, and I wouldn't be here if it wasn’t for Seth (Hancock, owner of Claiborne). How many family-owned and -operated farms are there left? That's the beauty of this. You can't let it slip away. And they won't. With Claiborne, the horse always comes first.\"\nGarrett Gomez, Blame's jockey, had mixed emotions about the win. \"(Zenyatta)'s been an ambassador for racing. We had a lot of people out here supporting her\", he said. \"She was going for 20 for 20 and she came up a head short.

All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6–6 draw.

We have been really close a couple times this year but it feels good to get it done. I know it is only qualifying but it feels really cool to get this first pole. It says a lot about this entire team.”\nRace.\nFirst stage.\nRyan Blaney led the field to the green flag at 7:53 p.m. Martin Truex Jr. shot past his outside exiting Turn 2 to take the lead on lap 11. The first caution of the race flew on lap 29 when Landon Cassill's right-front tire went flat and he slammed the wall in Turn 1.\nThe race restarted on lap 35. Cassill brought out the second caution on lap 50 when he slammed the wall a second time. Kevin Harvick opted not to pit and assumed the lead.

The following lap, Joey Logano went to the outside of Danica Patrick for position going into Turn 1 when he suffered a right-front brake failure, veered down and hooked Patrick, sending her head-on into the outside wall. Logano's car got loose and slid backwards into the wall not far ahead of her. Aric Almirola, who was seven car length's back of the wreck when it started, got loose in the top lane, couldn't slow it down in time, clipped the left-rear corner of Patrick's car and slammed into the drivers-side of Logano's car, lifting his car in the air for a few seconds. Logano and Patrick exited their wrecked cars under their own power, but Almirola, who put his window net down (to signal the safety crews that he was \"alert\"), required the safety team to extract him, and air lift to a local hospital, due to an injury that he sustained. This violent three-car wreck brought out the 11th caution with 68 to go, and cleanup necessitated a red flag for roughly 30 minutes.\nLogano said after he was released from the infield care center that all three drivers involved \"took a hard hit. Something broke on (my) car - I don't know what it was. I noticed it going in (to the turn) and tried to back off but you're going 215 (mph). I took a hard left. I just hope everyone is OK. I hooked Danica. I haven't seen the replay (until now). don't know what happened. The right-front popped and I took a hard left. I hope Aric is alright. That's the last thing you want to see is a big hit like that for anyone. It came out of nowhere. Everything was fine and I just took a hard one. I'm praying for Aric right now. I hate to be the part that started it but there was nothing I could have done. Something broke and we tore up a lot of cars.\"\nThe race restarted with 63 to go.

By 1951, indoor handball was introduced. Two years later, in 1953, Handball Federation of Kosovo was founded, under the auspices of the Yugoslav Handball Federation.\nIn 1979, whilst part of the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo hosted the 1979 Women's Junior World Handball Championship.\nFollowing the breakdown of Yugoslavia and subsequent independence of Kosovo as a nation, Handball Federation of Kosovo began operating independently.\nIn 2014, six years after Kosovo declared independence, the European Handball Federation (EHF) recognised Kosovo as a full member state and immediately the Kosovo national handball team started competing in international competition.\nAfter a difficult start, Kosovo's national team has started to gain notoriety in international competition. After twice winning the bronze medal in the international IHF Trophy for emerging nations, in Kosovo 2015 on home soil and as well in Bulgaria 2017 the team is no longer considered an emerging nation. Kosovo after this tournament advanced to the 2nd phase of qualification for EURO 2020.\nFollowing a lengthy campaign in the 2020 European Men's Handball Championship qualification where Kosovo defeated Israel and drew Poland, the team won a direct spot in the second phase of the upcoming 2022 qualification tournament.\nMost recently, at the 2021 World Men's Handball Championship – European qualification tournament, Kosovo drew with Italy and defeated Georgia to take the second place, behind Romania, in the qualifying group.\nIndividual all-time records.\nMost matches played.\nTotal number of matches played in official competitions only.\nMost goals scored.\nTotal number of goals scored in official competitions only."

In 1891, the Kent RFU created the Kent Cup as a county-wide competition for their members, one of the first few county cups established in England and the second in southern England after the Hampshire Rugby Football Union. They have a rich history in the men's senior County Championship since the early years of the competition, finishing as one of the regional winners in 1892, and became outright winners for the first time in 1897. They have gone on to win the top flight competition several more times, most recently in 2023.\nIn 2010, the Kent RFU were brought into national attention following an incident in a Kent Cup match between Maidstone and Gravesend where a Gravesend player was blinded in one eye as a result of eye-gouging. Despite a statement from the County Chairman that there would be a long ban for the perpetrator, there were no charges from either the Kent RFU, The RFU or Kent Police due to lack of evidence available. As a result, instead, Maidstone were fined £2,000 and deducted 50 league points for failing to identify the player.\nIn modern times Kent have yo-yoed between Division 1 and Division 2 of the championships, with the most recent silverware claimed being the 2014 Plate when the defeated Durham 30–23 at Twickenham Stadium. They also run regular county tours overseas including to New Zealand in 2012 and to Argentina in 2016.\nKent senior men's county side.\nKent senior men's county side currently play in the Bill Beaumont Division 1 South – the top level of the County Championships, having been promoted despite losing 33–27 to East Midlands in the 2016 Plate final.\nHonours:\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 56 clubs affiliated with the Kent RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. The majority of clubs are based in Kent, but there are also clubs from south-east London and even East Sussex.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Kent RFU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in Kent and parts of south-east London, which they also administer discipline for:"

Only four players broke par, including Dustin Johnson, one of the tournament favorites. The scoring average for the round was 76.47.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 15, 2018\"\nDustin Johnson held the lead after shooting a 67, four shots ahead of Charley Hoffman and Scott Piercy. \nAmateurs: \"Grimmer (+5)\", \"Gagne (+7)\", \"Parziale (+7)\", Thornberry (+9), Strafaci (+10), Ghim (+13), Rasmussen (+14), Hagestad (+15), Bergeron (+16), Humphrey (+16), Yu (+17), Huang (+18), Lumsden (+18), Rank (+18), Reitan (+18), Wiseman (+18), Ban (+19), Ellis (+19), Goodwin (+19), Barbaree (+21)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 16, 2018\"\nSecond round leader Dustin Johnson shot a seven-over 77 to fall into a four-way tie with Daniel Berger, Tony Finau and defending champion Brooks Koepka. Johnson double bogeyed the par-3 2nd and went six-over on the front-nine. He made his only birdie of the round at the 11th to get back to the top of the leaderboard, but three-putted for bogey on 18 to settle for a share of the 54-hole lead. Berger and Finau began the round in 45th place and 11 shots behind, but each shot 66 (−4) for the low round of the day. \nScoring conditions got more difficult as the day went on. Koepka's two-over 72 was the lowest score among the final four groups. Only three rounds in the 60s were recorded, two of them by Berger and Finau. The scoring average for the round was 75.3.\nPhil Mickelson incurred a two-shot penalty on the 13th when he walked after his ball which was running slowly away from the hole after his putt and deliberately hit the ball backwards towards the hole while it was still moving. He ended up shooting 81 (+11), equalling his highest score at the U.S. Open. \nAmateurs: Parziale (+11), Gagne (+12), Grimmer (+13)\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 17, 2018\"\nSummary.\nBrooks Koepka shot a final round 68 (−2) to finish one ahead of Tommy Fleetwood and win the U.S. Open for the second straight year. He was the first to successfully defend the title in 29 years, since Curtis Strange in 1989.\nKoepka began the round in a four-way tie for the lead with Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, and Tony Finau. He got off to a good start with birdies on three of his first five holes to get to even par and take the lead. At the par-3 11th, his tee shot went into the rough over the green. After chipping into a greenside bunker, he holed a putt to save bogey. At the following hole, he made a six-foot par putt, then at the 14th he got up-and-down to save par from short of the green with an eight-foot putt. Hitting his approach at the par-5 16th to within four feet, he made the birdie to open up a two-shot lead. Despite a bogey at the 18th, Koepka held on win by one.\nFleetwood shot the sixth round of 63 in U.S. Open history to finish in second. He began the round six behind and began by sinking a putt from at the 2nd and three more birdies on the front-nine. He made four straight birdies on holes 12–15, with putts of at 12, at 14, and at 15. Fleetwood had an eight-foot putt at the 18th for the first 62 in U.S. Open history, but it slid past the hole that would have forced the first two-hole playoff.\nJohnson made birdie at the 5th but three-putted for bogey at the 7th, 11th, 14th, and 17th. He birdied the last to shoot an even-par 70 and finish two shots behind Koepka. Finau bogeyed three of his first four holes but got back to even for the round with a 26-foot birdie at the 11th. He came to the 18th two back of Koepka but made double bogey and ended up in fifth place, four behind. Berger also started his round with two bogeys and finished with a three-over 73 to tie for sixth. Patrick Reed began three shots behind but birdied his first three holes and five of the first seven to tie for the lead. He made four bogeys the rest of the round, however, to fall back to fourth place. \nWith the win, Koepka becomes the seventh player to win consecutive U.S. Opens, and the first since Curtis Strange in 1989.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;\nMedia.\nThis was the fourth U.S. Open televised by Fox and FS1."

        "title": "Chicago Cardinals (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The Chicago Cardinals were a professional ice hockey team playing in the American Hockey Association. The team only played one season in the league. It was notable because it was founded by Eddie Livingstone, a Toronto businessman, who had owned an ice hockey team in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and whose actions led the owners of the NHA to disband the league and form the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1917. Livingstone formed the Cardinals in an attempt to bring about a rival league to the NHL. Because of the Cardinals, the NHL attacked the AHA and attempted to steal its players. The Cardinals would fold under pressure on the league and the team. Livingstone would attempt to recoup his losses by selling the team, but this was denied. He later tried to sue for damages.\nHistory.\nThe American Hockey Association was founded in October 1926. Livingstone purchased the Chicago franchise.. Livingstone was president of the franchise and Nip Dwan was the coach. Training camp was secretly at the Mutual Street Arena in Toronto. After the NHL caught wind of the franchise, the AHA president asked Livingstone to limit his ownership to only one season. Livingstone refused and the team began to play at the Chicago Coliseum.\nThe game of ice hockey was new to Chicago and a price war broke out between the Cardinals and the Black Hawks. NHL president Calder declared the NHL-AHA co-operation agreement void and declared that two players of the Cardinals belonged to other teams. McLaughlin began asking players to break their contracts and leave the team. The AHA found that Teddy Graham had broken a valid contract and was fined the amount of the difference between his Cardinals' contract and his contract with London, Ontario Ravens of the Ontario Senior League.\nThe price war sent the Cardinals into financial difficulty and the team was sold in March 1927 to a syndicate of Chicago businessmen, led by Harry Herendeen, a Chicago miller, which intended to continue the team as the \"Chicago Americans.\" The team played two games against the Duluth Hornets under the new ownership. However, the league did not approve the transfer and Livingstone suspended the team on the day of a game with St. Paul. The Coliseum announced that the ice hockey team was in arrears on its rent. Livingstone said the rejected new club owner had agreed to pay the rent.\nAfter the 1926–27 season, the AHA wanted to negotiate a new agreement with the NHL, setting out the rules for how the leagues would work together. NHL president Frank Calder threatened not to sign an agreement while the AHA was working with Livingstone. On August 24, 1927, the AHA terminated Livingstone's membership in the league. When Livingstone tried to sell the franchise, he was told that he did not have one to sell and that four of his players (Bobby Burns, the suspended Teddy Graham, Ralph Taylor and Marvin Wentworth) were now the property of the Black Hawks. In December 1927, he filed a $700,000 lawsuit against Frederic McLaughlin, owner of the Black Hawks, and two other members of the Black Hawks, charging them with tampering with his players and claiming that his team was taken away from him through a conspiracy.\nThe suit went to trial in September and October 1930. A mistrial was declared on October 2, after a juror discussed the case with McLaughlin. The suit was withdrawn on October 10 after a motion by Livingstone's lawyer, objecting to the lack of evidence he was allowed to present. In January 1931 filed suit again, against McLaughlin and 17 other defendants for $750,000 alleging a conspiracy to wreck his team. This suit did not proceed to trial.\nSeason record.\nThe team won its first game 3–0 versus the Detroit Greyhounds at the Chicago Coliseum on November 21, 1926, before 3,000 fans. The crowd was less than half the size of the crowd which had turned out for the Black Hawks' home opener the week before. Winston Fisher recorded the shutout, and Gord Brydson scored the team's first goal.\nClub folded on March 21, 1927.\nPlayers.\nMost of the players were making their professional debuts, having been selected from the amateur ice hockey ranks in Ontario by Livingstone. Several of the players would go on to minor league careers and several played in the NHL.\nSource: Society for International Hockey Research"

If there are not sufficient qualified entries in each event, the IAAF will invite the next highest ranked athletes to fill out the field, except in races 5,000 metres and longer. If a country does not have a qualified athlete in any events, one representative will be allowed to compete in a preliminary round of the 100 metres.

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career passed balls leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a catcher is charged with a passed ball when he fails to hold or control a legally pitched ball that, with ordinary effort, should have been maintained under his control, and, as a result of this loss of control, the batter or a runner on base advances. A runner who advances due to a passed ball is not credited with a stolen base unless he breaks for the base before the pitcher begins his delivery. A passed ball may be scored when a runner on first, second, or third base reaches the next base on a bobble or missed catch by the catcher, or when the batter-runner reaches first base on an uncaught third strike (\"see also\" Strikeout).\nThe list of career leaders is dominated by players from the 19th century, when fielding equipment was very rudimentary; baseball gloves only began to steadily gain acceptance in the 1880s, and were not uniformly worn until the mid-1890s, resulting in a much lower frequency of defensive miscues. Other protective equipment for catchers was also gradually introduced; the first masks were developed in the late 1870s, with improvements in the 1890s, but shin guards were not introduced to the major leagues until 1907. The top 47 players in career passed balls all played primarily in the 19th century, with two-thirds playing their entire careers prior to 1894; only eight were active after 1900, and none were active after 1912.\nPop Snyder, who retired in 1891 with a record 877 games as a catcher, is the all-time leader in passed balls with 763, nearly four times as many as any catcher who began their career after 1915. Silver Flint, who ended his career in 1889, is second with 639, and holds the National League record of 602. Lance Parrish has the most passed balls (192) of any catcher after 1915, and holds the American League record of 158."

        "title": "Surfing in Ireland",
        "text": "Ireland has become increasingly popular as a surfing destination, due to its exposed location on the turbulent Atlantic seaboard.\nThe island has 3,172 kilometers of coastline, and the southern and western shores are exposed for waves originating in the North Atlantic. Although Ireland is located at a high latitude, the warm ocean currents of the North Atlantic drift ensures mild water temperatures throughout the year, with a minimum of 10 °C (50 °F) in winter and a maximum of 21 °C (70 °F) in summer.\nThe numerous beaches, reefs, headlands and coves along the west coast of Ireland serve as popular surf spots. Ireland has played host to international events since the 1960s, and is home to many surf shops, schools and clubs.\nHistory.\nSurfing has been documented in Ireland as early as 1949, however it wasn't until 1964 that the \"Bray Island Surf Club\" was founded. Ireland was first represented at the World Surfing Championship in 1966 by Kevin Cavey, which in turn inspired the first Irish National Surfing Championships, held in Tramore, County Waterford in 1967. The first Irish Inter County Surfing Championships was held in 1968, followed by a full Irish team entry in the inaugural European Surfing Championships of 1969.\nThe growing interest in competition surfing mirrored a general interest in surfing across the island, with the number of participants and clubs growing rapidly throughout the late 60s; by 1970, there were an estimated 400 surfers in the country. This led to the foundation of the Irish Surfing Association in that year.\nGoverning body.\n\"Irish Surfing\", also known as the \"Irish Surfing Association\", is a voluntary organisation that governs the sport of surfing on the island of Ireland. It participates in club development, instructor training and surf school regulation, and promoting surfing safety and the protection of the environment, as well as overseeing competitive surfing in Ireland.\nClubs.\nThere are 16 surf clubs accredited by the Irish Surfing Association.\nThere are also many unaccredited surf clubs throughout the country.\nCompetitions.\nThe two most important annual events in the Irish surfing calendar are the Irish National Surfing Championships, held in Bundoran, County Donegal, and the Irish Inter County Surfing Championships, held in Rossnowlagh, County Donegal.\nIreland has frequently hosted international competitions, including the Smirnoff International (Easky, 1979), the European Surfing Championships (Lahinch, 1972; Rossnowlagh, 1985; Bundoran, 1997 &amp; 2011) and the Billabong Monster Tow In Surf Session (Mullaghmore 2011, 2012/13).\nCulture.\nAlthough surfing is not universally associated with Ireland, there is a growing surfing subculture to accommodate the increased interest in the sport. There have been a number of surfing documentaries filmed on the island (including the acclaimed 2008 documentary, Waveriders), as well as annual surf music festivals and a surf film festival.\nDemographics.\nIreland has an estimated 20,000 resident surfers. In addition, the country is an increasingly popular destination for surfing tourists.\nBig wave surfing.\nIreland's location on the edge of the North Atlantic makes it a good location for accessing large waves. The record for the largest measured wave, at 19 m (62 ft) tall, is held by a buoy off the north-west coast of the country, and satellite imagery has shown a tendency for the generation of waves in excess of 9 m (30 ft) tall in the area.\nIreland's most iconic big wave, known as \"Ailleens\" after the nearby \"Aill na Searrach\" cliffs, is located off the Cliffs of Moher, County Clare, and is a popular location for tow-in surfing. Although championed by many as a \"perfect wave\", with a potential height of 12 m (39 ft), Ailleens is not an everyday occurrence, as it requires stormy conditions and strong east winds offshore.\nMullaghmore Head's 9 m (30 ft) waves, in County Sligo, have served as the platform for the \"Billabong Monster Tow In Surf Session\" since 2011\".\" A nearby wave, known as \"Prowlers\", has been surfed at an estimated height of 15 m (50 ft)."

The company is based in Scottsdale, Arizona and was established in 2014 by Bob Parsons, founder of web hosting service GoDaddy.\nHistory.\nParsons Xtreme Golf was founded in 2014 by Bob Parsons, an American entrepreneur, billionaire, and philanthropist. He is an avid golfer who made his money in the technology industry and now invests in ventures that support his passions. Unsatisfied with many golf clubs on the market, he decided to launch his own golf equipment company. Parsons claims to have spent $350,000 annually searching for the right equipment. He stated that he decided to enter the golf club manufacturing business in an attempt to build a better golf club.\nThe company hired Mike Nicolette, a PGA Tour professional in the 1970s and '80s, who served as senior product designer for PING prior to joining PXG. PXG also hired Brad Schweigert, formerly PING’s director of engineering, to assume the role of Chief Product Officer. Given no time or budget constraints, Schweigert and Nicolette worked on designing the first iteration of what would become the PXG 0311 forged iron.\nAccording to Parsons, PXG’s breakthrough came when its engineers identified the material to fill the hollow-bodied club head. A thermoplastic elastomer was injection molded into the club’s hidden cavity adding cushioning to the club’s thin face, improving performance and feel.\nIn January 2015, Ryan Moore announced that he would be using a set of PXG prototype irons and wedges in the PGA Tour that year.\nCurrently, the company offers a full line of equipment including drivers, woods, hybrids, wedges, irons, and putters. As of December 2016, the company had grown to seventy employees.\nProducts.\nParsons is a former United States Marine who served in Vietnam War. PXG’s club numbering convention (0211, 0311, 0317, 0341, and 0811) is inspired by the United States military occupational code, as a tribute to the Marine Corps. PXG sells its products through its Scottsdale headquarters, club-fitters, golf and country clubs, and other international distributors.\nSponsorships.\nPXG has maintained sponsorship deals with professional golfers who play on the PGA and LPGA tours. PXG's professional staff includes Zach Johnson, Eric Cole, Luke List, David Lipsky, Joel Dahmen and LPGA players Christina Kim, Lydia Ko and Céline Boutier."

As a sophomore he was selected as a second team All-American and played three seasons for the Huskies before forgoing his final year of eligibility to play professionally. Bell returned to Northeastern and graduated in 1954 and after an 11-game stint with the Worcester Warriors he was chosen to succeed his former bench boss Herb Gallagher as coach of the Huskies.\nBell coached the men's team for fifteen seasons, producing respectable if unspectacular records. He led the team to its first two appearances in the ECAC Tournament but towards the end of his tenure the team was known more for losing than anything else. Bell resigned from his position after the Huskies finished dead last in 1969–70. After hockey Bell joined the engineering firm of Fenton G. Keyes Associates where he worked until his retirement.\nJim Bell was named as the New England Coach of the Year in 1956 and was the recipient of the Shaeffer Pen Award in 1970. He was an inaugural member of the Northeastern University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1974."

All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6–6 draw.\nWest German Helga Niessen won the tournament by defeating American Peaches Bartkowicz 6–4, 6–3 in the final. Another American, Julie Heldman, won the third place.\nSeeds.\nBoth seeds received a bye into the quarterfinals.\nDraw.\nBronze-medal match"

        "title": "2018–19 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2018 season began with the Wildcard Round on January 5, 2019, and concluded with Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 3, 2019, when the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3.\nFor the first time in NFL history, both conference championship games went to overtime.\nThe Patriots became the first team since the Buffalo Bills in 1990–1993 to reach at least three consecutive Super Bowls, and the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to win the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year.\nWild card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 5, 2019.\nAFC: Indianapolis Colts 21, Houston Texans 7.\nIndianapolis, who had started the year 1–5 and still managed to make the playoffs, buried the Texans with 276 yards and 21 points in the first half.\nOn the opening drive of the game, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck completed three passes to T. Y. Hilton for 63 yards before finishing the drive with a 5-yard scoring completion to Eric Ebron. Then after a punt, Indianapolis drove 75 yards in 9 plays to go up 14–0. The key player on the drive was running back Marlon Mack, who carried the ball 6 times for 39 yards, caught a 6-yard pass and finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Houston then drove to the Colts' 45-yard line; but while trying to convert a 4th-and-4, Deshaun Watson's pass was intercepted by Kenny Moore II, who returned it from 10 yards to midfield. Indianapolis then advanced the ball to the Texans' 17-yard line, but they also failed to score when Luck's pass was deflected by J. J. Watt and then intercepted by lineman Brandon Dunn on the last play of the first quarter.\nHouston had to punt after three plays and the Colts went on to drive to a 21–0 lead by moving the ball 65 yards in 7 plays, featuring two key receptions by receiver Dontrelle Inman. The first was for 21 yards and the second was an 18-yard touchdown catch. Houston responded with their most promising drive of the game, advancing the ball 69 yards to the Colts' 9-yard line. However, on a 4th-and-1 conversion attempt, Watson threw an incomplete pass with 1:24 left in the half.\nBoth defenses controlled the third quarter as the first six drives of it ended in punts. With just over 2 minutes left in the period, the Texans fired up a 16-play, 89-yard drive. Watson rushed for 10 yards, while also completing 9-of-11 passes for 66 yards, the last a 6-yard touchdown pass to Keke Coutee that made the score 21–7 with 11:04 remaining. Following a Colts punt, the Texans drove to a 3rd-and-10 on the Indianapolis 24-yard line. Watson's next two passes were incomplete, causing a turnover on downs with 4:17 remaining. The Colts then managed to run out the rest of the time, mainly due to plays from Mack, who picked up first downs with runs of 2, 15 and 26 yards.\nLuck completed 19-of-32 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, and rushed for 29 yards. Hilton was his top receiver with five receptions for 85 yards. Mack carried the ball 24 times for a franchise postseason record 148 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for six yards. Prior to this game, the Texans had not allowed a 100-yard rusher all season. Moore had 6 tackles (5 solo), a sack and an interception. Watson completed 29-of-49 passes for 235 yards, with one touchdown and one interception; he was also Houston's leading rusher with eight carries for 76 yards. Coutee caught 11 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 24, Seattle Seahawks 22.\nDallas outgained Seattle in total yards 380–299 and limited the Seahawks, the #1 rushing offense during the regular season, to just 73 yards on the ground.\nDallas scored on their opening drive, advancing the ball 54 yards in 10 plays on the way to a 39-yard field goal by Brett Maher. This would be the only score of the first quarter, as the next six drives ended in punts. In the second quarter, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson's completions to Ed Dickson and Tyler Lockett for gains of 26 and 40 yards set up Sebastian Janikowski's 27-yard field goal. Dallas responded with a drive to the Seattle 40-yard line, but it ended there as Maher missed a 58-yard field goal attempt. Seattle took over on their own 48-yard line; Wilson's 25-yard pass to Lockett on the ensuing drive set up another Janikowski field goal to give Seattle a 6–3 lead. A few plays into the Cowboys' next possession, they faced 3rd-and-1 with 1:11 left in the half. Ezekiel Elliott took a handoff, ran to the right and raced down the sideline for a 44-yard gain to the Seahawks' 22-yard line. Four plays later, Dak Prescott finished the 75-yard drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Michael Gallup with 28 seconds left, giving Dallas a 10–6 lead. Lockett gave Seattle a chance to score by returning the ensuing kickoff 52 yards to the Cowboys' 49-yard line; Seattle could only advance to the 39-yard line from there and ended the half with Janikowski's missed field goal attempt from 60 yards. Janikowski injured his leg on the kick and had to miss the rest of the game, turning the kicking duties over to rookie punter Michael Dickson.\nWith 8:04 left in the third quarter, Seahawks defensive back Neiko Thorpe managed to knock Michael Dickson's 45-yard punt away from the end zone, where it was downed by Seattle on the Cowboys' 2-yard line. Dallas failed to gain any yards over their next three plays and Chris Jones' 42-yard punt gave the ball back to Seattle on the Dallas 44-yard line. Faced with 4th down and 4 after three plays, Seattle decided to go for the first down, a gamble that paid off as Wilson threw a pass to Doug Baldwin, who barely managed to keep his feet in bounds while hauling in the ball at the left sideline for a 22-yard gain. Then when faced with 3rd-and-5, Wilson managed to pick up the first down himself on a 7-yard run. Finally with just over 2 minutes left in the quarter, Wilson finished the 9-play, 44-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run; Mike Davis ran for a successful two-point conversion, giving the Seahawks a 14–10 lead. Michael Dickson drop-kicked the ensuing kickoff, which went to running back Rod Smith at the 20-yard line, where he returned it 15 yards. Four plays later, Prescott completed a 34-yard pass to Amari Cooper at the Seattle 16-yard line, setting up Elliott's 1-yard touchdown run that gave the Dallas a 17–14 lead with just over 12 minutes left. After three plays, Tavon Austin returned Michael Dickson's 60-yard punt 51 yards to the Seattle 38-yard line. Dallas was now in prime position to take a late-game two-score lead, but after driving to the 16-yard line, Prescott threw a pass to Noah Brown that bounced off his shoulder and was intercepted in the end zone by K. J. Wright as he fell to the ground. Still, Dallas' defense rose to the occasion and forced a punt, which Cole Beasley returned 7 yards to the Dallas 37-yard line. The Cowboys went on to drive 54 yards in 11 plays, aided by three Seattle penalties, including two pass interference calls on third down plays. Elliott also made a big impact with a 17-yard run, while Prescott converted a 3rd-and-14 with a 16-yard run before taking the ball into the end zone himself on a 1-yard score. This gave Dallas a 24–14 lead with 2:14 left.\nOn the second play after the kickoff, Wilson's 53-yard completion to Lockett gave Seattle a first down on the Dallas 13-yard line. Wilson followed this up with two completions to backup running back J. D. McKissic, the first for 6 yards and the second a 7-yard touchdown pass. Chris Carson then scored on a two-point conversion run, cutting the score to 24–22 with 1:16 left. However, Michael Dickson's ensuing drop kick went right into the hands of Beasley, enabling Dallas to run out the rest of the game and secure their first playoff win since the 2014 playoffs.\nPrescott finished the game 22-of-33 for 226 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. He also rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Cooper, who caught seven passes for 106 yards. Elliott had 26 carries for 137 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 32 yards. For Seattle, Wilson completed 18-of-27 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 14 yards and a score. Lockett caught four passes for 120 yards, returned a kickoff for 52 yards and gained 22 yards on three punt returns. Michael Dickson averaged 51.4 yards per punt on his seven punts and put one of them in the 20.\nSunday, January 6, 2019.\nAFC: Los Angeles Chargers 23, Baltimore Ravens 17.\nThe Chargers recorded six sacks, jumped out to a 23–3 lead and halted a late Ravens rally, forcing Lamar Jackson to fumble on the final drive to earn a trip to New England.\nOn the Ravens' second possession of the game, Chargers defensive end Melvin Ingram forced a fumble from Kenneth Dixon that was recovered by safety Adrian Phillips, giving Los Angeles the ball on the Baltimore 14-yard line. Three plays later, Michael Badgley kicked a 21-yard field goal to give Los Angeles a 3–0 lead. Then the Chargers' defense forced a punt, which Desmond King returned 42 yards to the Ravens' 42-yard line, setting up a 53-yard Badgley field goal that increased their lead to 6–0. Early in the second quarter, Phillips intercepted a pass from Jackson to give the Chargers a first down on the Ravens' 44-yard line. From there, they drove 27 yards to go up 9–0 on Badgley's third field goal. Following another Ravens punt, Los Angeles drove 53 yards in 12 plays to score on Badgley's fourth field goal on the last play of the half, giving them a 12–0 lead.\nKing returned the second half kickoff 72 yards to the Ravens' 35-yard line, but this time the Chargers failed to score when Badgley's field goal attempt was blocked by Za'Darius Smith. After a Ravens punt, linebacker Patrick Onwuasor forced a fumble from Chargers tight end Virgil Green that was recovered by linebacker C. J. Mosley on the Los Angeles 21-yard line. This set up Justin Tucker's 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 12–3 with 8:34 left in the third quarter. At the end of Los Angeles' next possession, the Ravens got another scoring opportunity when Javorius Allen blocked Donnie Jones's punt, resulting in Baltimore taking over on the Chargers' 40-yard line; they only managed to gain 4 yards with their next three plays and Tucker's 50-yard field goal attempt was wide right. Los Angeles then drove 60 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 28-yard completion from Philip Rivers to Mike Williams on the Ravens' 15-yard line. On the next play, Melvin Gordon ran the ball 14 yards to the 1-yard line. The Ravens managed to keep Los Angeles out of the end zone for the next three plays, but Gordon scored with a 4th down 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the 4th quarter; Rivers completed a pass to Williams for a two-point conversion, giving the Chargers a 20–3 lead.\nA sack by Ingram on the Ravens' ensuing drive forced them to punt from their 14-yard line and Sam Koch's 31-yard kick gave the Chargers good field position on the Ravens' 45-yard line. Los Angeles then drove 16 yards, including a 9-yard scramble by Rivers on 3rd-and-8, to score on Badgley's 5th field goal, from 47 yards, that gave them a 23–3 lead. Taking the ball back with 9:02 left, Baltimore drove 75 yards in eight plays, including Jackson's 29-yard completion to Willie Snead on 4th-and-11. On the next play, Jackson threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to receiver Michael Crabtree, making the score 23–10. The Chargers recovered Baltimore's ensuing onside kick attempt, but still had to punt after three plays. Baltimore went on to drive 85 yards in 12 plays, the longest a 39-yard completion from Jackson to Dixon. On the last play, Jackson threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Crabtree, narrowing their gap to 23–17 with 2:06 left. Baltimore then forced a punt with 45 seconds to go, giving them one last chance to drive for a winning touchdown, but Chargers linebacker Uchenna Nwosu forced a fumble while sacking Jackson and Ingram recovered it to give Los Angeles the victory.\nRivers completed 22-of-32 passes for 160 yards and rushed for 15 yards. Ingram finished the game with seven tackles (two for a loss of yards), two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Phillips had five tackles (three solo), an interception and a fumble recovery. King returned a kickoff for 72 yards and had four punt returns for 46 yards. Jackson completed 14-of-29 passes for 194 yards, with two touchdowns and an interception; he was also Baltimore's leading rusher with 9 carries for 54 yards. Onwausor had seven tackles (six solo), a sack and a forced fumble.\nNFC: Philadelphia Eagles 16, Chicago Bears 15.\nNick Foles threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Golden Tate with 56 seconds remaining and then defensive tackle Treyvon Hester blocked a 43-yard Cody Parkey game-winning field goal attempt with five seconds remaining to seal it for the Eagles.\nBoth offenses had a slow start of the game. Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles completed 4/6 passes for 57 yards on the opening drive, setting up Jake Elliott's 43-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead. The next three drives ended in a punt, two of which were three-and-outs. Foles was picked off by Roquan Smith at the beginning of the second quarter when the Eagles were 10 yards into Chicago territory. Smith returned it into the end zone for what would have been a Bears touchdown, but he was ruled down by contact at Chicago's 35-yard line. The interception started a 47-yard drive in which Mitchell Trubisky completed 3 passes for 28 yards and rushed for 6. The possession ended in a Cody Parkey 36-yard field goal to tie the game at 3–3. Philadelphia went deep into the Bears' territory in their next possession, but a Foles pass intended for Nelson Agholor was intercepted by Adrian Amos inside the end zone. After another three-and-out by each team, Chicago set up the final drive of the quarter, starting from their own 11-yard line. Trubisky completed 6/8 passes for 59 yards, the longest a 23-yard catch by Anthony Miller, as the team drove 78 yards to go up 6–3 on Parkey's 29-yard field goal as time expired in the half.\nThe Eagles scored the first touchdown of the game in the third quarter to regain the lead. At the start of the drive, a late hit by Amos on Zach Ertz caused an unnecessary roughness penalty called against the Bears, on what would have been a three-and-out. Another penalty against the Chicago defense for pass interference on Prince Amukamara resulted in a 33-yard gain that gave the Eagles 1st-and-goal. Foles capitalized with a 10-yard touchdown pass to the rookie tight end Dallas Goedert, giving the Eagles a 10–6 lead. The Bears' offense responded with a 62-yard drive, including a 45-yard completion from Trubisky to Allen Robinson, that ended in another field goal by Parkey from 34 yards at the beginning of the fourth quarter to cut the Eagles' lead to one at 10–9. The next Bears drive saw some Trubisky crucial throws, including a 19-yard pass to Taylor Gabriel on 3rd-and-11 and a 34-yard pass to Josh Bellamy. A 22-yard pass to Robinson for the touchdown culminated the possession and put Chicago ahead of Philadelphia once again, although their two-point attempt was unsuccessful, making he score 15–10. The Eagles, trailing by five, started what would be the winning drive on their own 40-yard line after a bad punt by the Bears. The Bears were able to stop three downs starting at their 2-yard line, but Philadelphia finally scored on 4th down with Foles' 2-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate to take a one-point lead with less than one minute remaining. The Eagles went for the two-point conversion, but a rush by Wendell Smallwood was ruled to be short of the end zone. The play was reviewed, but video evidence was not clear enough to overturn the ruling on the field.\nChicago started their final drive of the game with 0:56 left. Tarik Cohen returned the kickoff 35 yards to the Bears' 42-yard line and a 25-yard pass from Trubisky to Robinson settled the home team into field goal position. The Eagles called a timeout before the snap to negate the first field goal try. After that, Parkey's 43-yard kick was tipped by the Eagles' defensive tackle Treyvon Hester, hit the left goal post and bounced off the crossbar to send Philadelphia to the divisional round. Parkey later reacted, \"I feel terrible. There's really no answer to it. I thought I hit a good ball.\" The kick became known as the \"double doink\" after NBC color commentator Cris Collinsworth stated immediately afterward, \"Oh my goodness, the Bears' season is going to end on a double doink\". The next day, the NFL officially declared the kick had been blocked by Hester instead of declaring it a Parkey missed field goal attempt.\nBoth offensive units relied much more on the passing game than the rushing one. Chicago quarterback Trubisky completed 26 passes out of 43 attempts for a total 303 yards and a touchdown, while Philadelphia's Foles completed 25 passes out of 40 for 266 yards and two scores. Meanwhile, the Eagles offense totaled 42 yards from 23 carries and the Bears totaled 65 yards from 18 carries, ending up as the last and second-to-last team in rushing yards at the wild card weekend, respectively. Robinson was the top receiver of the game, with 10 receptions, 143 yards and a score.\nThe final drive of the first half included a controversial play. With 0:36 left, Trubisky threw a pass down the field to Miller, who apparently caught the ball, but was then broken up by Eagles cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc. The play was ruled an incomplete pass by the referees, but upon reviewing it, it looked like it was indeed a complete pass, then fumbled as Miller became a runner. However, that hypothetical fumble was not recovered by anyone and the ruling on the field was upheld. While that was misunderstood by most viewers, the NFL rule book states that in this situation, \"if there is no video evidence of a clear recovery […] the ruling of incomplete stands.\"\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 12, 2019.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 31, Indianapolis Colts 13.\nKansas City dominated the game the whole way through, racking up 433 yards and 29 first downs, while holding the Colts to 263 yards, 15 first downs and 0-for-9 on third down conversions. Kansas City would go to the AFC Championship Game for the first time since 1993 and the second time in franchise history.\nIn the first quarter alone, the Chiefs gained 185 yards and nine first downs, while holding Indianapolis to 12 yards and no first downs. Following a Colts punt on the opening drive, Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes led the team 75 yards in five plays, including his 44-yard completion to Sammy Watkins, to score on Damien Williams' 10-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis was quickly forced to punt again and the Chiefs stormed back for another touchdown. This time, they drove 65 yards in eight plays to take a 14–0 lead with receiver Tyreek Hill's 36-yard touchdown run on an end around play. The Colts went three-and-out for the third time in row and Kansas City took off for another scoring drive as the first quarter ended. Mahomes completed 5-of-10 passes for 47 yards as the team advanced 48 yards in 15 plays to go up 17–0 on Harrison Butker's 39-yard field goal.\nWith six minutes left in the second quarter, Indianapolis finally managed to strike back when Colts linebacker Najee Goode blocked Dustin Colquitt's punt and Zach Pascal recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown to make the score 17–7. But the Colts' defense still could not stop the Chiefs as Mahomes completed a 30-yard pass to tight end Travis Kelce on the first play of their ensuing drive. One play later, Mahomes hooked up with Hill for a 14-yard completion on the Colts' 26-yard line. Kansas City was on the move and did not stop until Mahomes finished the possession with a 4-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 24–7. Indianapolis got the ball back with 1:40 left in the half. On their first play, Andrew Luck completed a 21-yard pass to Eric Ebron, giving the Colts their first first down of the game. He then followed it up with a 12-yard pass to Dontrelle Inman. The drive continued until the Colts reached the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but with only three seconds left in the half, 46-year old kicker Adam Vinatieri hit the left upright on his 23-yard field goal attempt—his shortest missed field goal in 23 NFL seasons.\nKansas City started the second half with a drive to the Colts' 33-yard line, but this time failed to score as Mahomes was sacked by Denico Autry for a 5-yard loss while trying to convert on 4th-and-5. Following some punts, Indianapolis got a big scoring opportunity when Shaquille Leonard forced and recovered a fumble from Watkins on the Chiefs' 20-yard line. But on the Colts' ensuing drive, Chiefs lineman Dee Ford forced a fumble while sacking Luck and linebacker Justin Houston recovered it with 50 seconds left in the third quarter.\nThere would no more scoring until 5:30 remained in the game, when Luck finished an 87-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, cutting the score to 24–13 after Vinatieri missed the extra point, the first time he had missed such an attempt in the postseason. But any chance of a Colts comeback was ended on the Chiefs' following drive, starting with Tremon Smith's 23-yard kickoff return to the Chiefs' 39-yard line. From there, Damien Williams rushed seven times for 50 yards as the team drove 56 yards in nine plays to score on Darrel Williams' 6-yard rushing touchdown, making the score 31–13 and putting the game out of reach.\nMahomes finished his first playoff game 27-for-41 for 278 yards while also rushing for 8 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was his leading receiver with seven receptions for 108 yards, while Hill caught eight passes for 72 yards, rushed for 36 yards and a touchdown, and gained 6 yards returning punts. Damien Williams, who had been thrust into the starting lineup late in the season to replace the departed Kareem Hunt and the injured Spencer Ware, finished his first playoff game with 25 carries for 129 yards and a touchdown, along with five receptions for 25 yards. Houston had two tackles for a loss, two sacks and a fumble recovery. Luck completed 19-of-36 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 17 yards. Leonard had 14 tackles (10 solo), a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.\nThis would also be Luck's last game in the NFL, as he retired before the commencement of the 2019 NFL season.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 30, Dallas Cowboys 22.\nThis was the ninth time these two franchises met in the postseason, extending their NFL record. Los Angeles gained 459 yards, including 273 yards on the ground, with running backs C. J. Anderson and Todd Gurley both rushing for 100 yards each as they earned their first playoff win since the 2004 season and went to their first NFC Championship since 2001. On the other side of the ball, their defense limited Ezekiel Elliott, the league's leading rusher during the season, to just 47 yards on 20 carries.\nThe Rams advanced 57 yards in 11 plays on their opening drive, the longest a 19-yard completion from Jared Goff to tight end Tyler Higbee, to score on Greg Zuerlein's 25-yard field goal and take a 3–0 lead. Dallas responded by advancing the ball 71 yards in 7 plays, featuring a 20-yard run by Elliott. On the next play, Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper, giving the team a 7–3 lead. Los Angeles then drove 70 yards in 16 plays, but ended up having to settle for another Zuerlein field goal that made the score 7–6 with 31 seconds left in the first quarter.\nThe next time the Rams got the ball, Goff completed three of four pass attempts for 47 yards, while Anderson finished the drive with a pair of carries, the first for 14 yards and the second a 1-yard touchdown run that put the team up 13–7. Then JoJo Natson returned Dallas' next punt 12 yards to the Rams' 36-yard line, where the team went on to drive 64 yards in six plays, scoring with Gurley's 35-yard touchdown run that upped their lead to 20–7. The Cowboys were soon forced to punt again, giving Los Angeles one last chance to score before halftime. They managed to advance to the Dallas 45-yard line, but as time in the half expired, Zuerlein missed a 63-yard field goal attempt.\nDallas' offensive futility continued in the second half as they had to punt for the fourth consecutive drive and the Rams drove back for more points. A 21-yard completion from Goff to Brandin Cooks and an 18-yard run from Gurley set up Zuerlein's third field goal, from 44 yards, that put the Rams up 23–7. But this time, the Cowboys' offense finally managed to get a drive going, advancing 75 yards in nine plays. Receiver Michael Gallup caught passes for gains of 27 and 44 yards, while Elliott converted a 4th-and-1 with a 5-yard carry, and later finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then Prescott completed a pass to Cooper for a two-point conversion, cutting their deficit to 23–15 with 5:20 left in the third quarter. After forcing the Rams to punt, Dallas drove to the Los Angeles 35-yard line. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Elliott attempted to again convert a 4th-and-1, but this time he was stopped by Rams defenders John Johnson and Lamarcus Joyner for no gain.\nThe Rams then went on to drive 65 yards in 12 plays, successfully converting their own 4th-and-1 with a 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson to put themselves in front 30–15 with just over seven minutes left in the game. Prescott started off the Cowboys' next drive with a 24-yard completion to Gallup on the Rams' 49-yard line and later converted a 4th-and-1 with a 2-yard run. Eventually the team found themselves facing 4th-and-3 on the Rams' 17-yard line. Prescott's pass on the next play was incomplete, but defensive back Aqib Talib was penalized for committing pass interference in the end zone, giving them first and goal on the 1-yard line, where Prescott eventually ran the ball into the end zone, making the score 30–22 with 2:11 left. After the ensuing touchback, Dallas forced the Rams into a 3rd-and-7, but Goff ran 9 yards for a first down, enabling Los Angeles to run out the clock and win the game.\nGoff completed 15-of-28 passes for 186 yards and rushed for 12 yards. Anderson, playing for his third team in the 2018 season, had 23 carries for 123 yards and two touchdowns, and Gurley rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 3 yards. For the Cowboys, Prescott completed 20-of-32 passes for 266 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 3 yards and another touchdown. Gallup was the top receiver of the game with six receptions for 119 yards.\nAt age 32, Rams coach Sean McVay became the youngest coach to win an NFL playoff game.\nSunday, January 13, 2019.\nAFC: New England Patriots 41, Los Angeles Chargers 28.\nNew England piled up 347 yards in the first half and scored touchdowns on five of their first six possessions to defeat the Chargers, which sent the Patriots to the AFC championship game for the eighth consecutive season.\nThe Patriots started the game by driving 83 yards in 14 plays, scoring on Sony Michel's 1-yard touchdown run. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers quickly led his team right back, completing an 18-yard pass to Mike Williams on 3rd-and-15 before tying the game on a 43-yard touchdown completion to Keenan Allen. New England then drove 67 yards in 7 plays, the longest a 28-yard completion from Tom Brady to receiver Julian Edelman. On the next play, Michel ran 14 yards to the end zone to give the Patriots a 14–7 lead with less than a minute left in the first quarter.\nLos Angeles had to punt after three plays and Edelman returned it 6 yards to the Patriots' 42-yard line. Then he caught passes for gains of 11 and 17 yards as New England drove 58 yards to take a 21–7 lead on Brady's 15-yard touchdown pass to receiver Phillip Dorsett. Following another Chargers punt, Brady completed a 25-yard pass to running back James White on New England's first play. A few plays later, Michel took off for a 40-yard run to the Chargers' 9-yard line, where Rex Burkhead took the ball to the end zone over the next two plays, the second a 6-yard touchdown run to put the Patriots up 28–7. The next time New England got the ball, they were forced into a three-and-out, but Chargers returner Desmond King muffed their punt and Albert McClellan recovered it for the Patriots on the Chargers' 35-yard line. Brady then started the ensuing possession with a 19-yard completion to Edelman, while Michel finished it with his third touchdown run, a 5-yard carry, that put the team up 35–7 with 1:40 left in the half. They nearly scored again after forcing a Los Angeles punt, but Dorsett was tackled on the Chargers' 30-yard line as time expired.\nIn the first half alone, Brady completed 23-of-29 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, Michel had 16 carries for 105 yards and three touchdowns, White caught 10 passes for 71 yards, and Edelman caught 7 passes for 107 yards while also returning 3 punts for 31 yards.\nLos Angeles had to punt on their opening drive of the second half and Brady's 25-yard completion to tight end Rob Gronkowski set up a 28-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal, increasing New England's lead to 38–7. This time the Chargers were able to respond, as Williams caught 3 passes for 40 yards as the team drove 72 yards in 10 plays to score on Melvin Gordon's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 38–14. But Los Angeles' defense still could not contain New England, as Brady's completions to Edelman and White for gains of 35 and 23 yards lead to another Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 41–14 lead with 12:27 left.\nFollowing a few punts, Rivers completed passes to Tyrell Williams and Allen for gains of 29 and 32 yards as the team drove to score on his 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Virgil Green. Then he completed a pass to Allen for a two-point conversion, making the score 41–22 with 7:28 left. After failing to recover an onside kick, the Chargers forced a punt, but Patriots defensive back Stephon Gilmore ended their following drive with an interception. By the time Los Angeles got the ball back, only three minutes remained, which they used to drive 80 yards in 12 plays to score on Rivers' 8-yard pass to tight end Antonio Gates, making the final score 41–28 following a failed two-point conversion attempt.\nBrady completed 34-of-44 passes for 343 yards and a touchdown. Edelman caught 9 passes for 131 yards and returned 5 punts for 37 yards, moving to second place all-time in playoff receptions, behind only Jerry Rice. White tied an all-time playoff record with 15 receptions for 97 yards. Michel ran 24 times for 129 yards and three touchdowns, and caught a pass for 9 yards. Rivers finished the day 25-of-51 for 331 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Tyrell Williams was his top receiver with 5 receptions for 94 yards.\nWith this win, Tom Brady improved his record against Rivers to 8–0 (counting regular season and playoff games).\nDown judge Sarah Thomas became the first woman to officiate an NFL postseason game and second woman to officiate a postseason game in one of the four major North American professional sports leagues, following the NBA’s Violet Palmer.\nNFC: New Orleans Saints 20, Philadelphia Eagles 14.\nNew Orleans had defeated the Eagles 48–7 during the regular season, and while the score of this game would be much closer, the result did not change. Though Philadelphia scored touchdowns on their first two drives, the Saints' defense managed to shut them out for the rest of the game, clinching the win with an interception by Marshon Lattimore in the closing minutes on the Eagles' final possession.\nPhiladelphia got off to a strong start as cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc intercepted Saints quarterback Drew Brees' pass on the game's first play, giving the Eagles a first down on the New Orleans 24-yard line. The Eagles then drove 76 yards in seven plays to score on Nick Foles' 37-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Matthews. The Saints soon had to punt, and Philadelphia drove back for more points. Their next drive covered 75 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 30-yard reception by Alshon Jeffery. Foles finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run on a QB sneak, giving his team a 14–0 lead before the Saints had managed to gain a single yard on offense.\nNew Orleans' third drive fared no better as they had to punt after Brees was sacked twice, the second time losing a fumble that was recovered by offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk. But in what turned out to be a crucial momentum-shifting play, Lattimore made a leaping interception of a Foles pass on the Saints' 21-yard line with 13:35 left in the half.\nNew Orleans then drove to a 4th-and-1 on their own 30-yard line and sent their punt unit onto the field. Playing from the blocking back position in the formation, backup quarterback Taysom Hill took a direct snap and ran four yards for a first down, extending the drive. On the next play, Brees completed a 42-yard pass to Michael Thomas on the Eagles' 24-yard line. Eventually, the Saints faced 4th-and-goal from the 2-yard line and managed to convert again, this time with Brees' 2-yard touchdown pass to receiver Keith Kirkwood to finish off the 12-play, 79-yard drive with 7:23 left in the half. After the next three drives resulted in punts, New Orleans got the ball on their own 6-yard line with 1:18 remaining in the half. Brees subsequently completed four successive passes for 71 yards as the team drove to a 45-yard field goal by Wil Lutz, making the score 14–10 at halftime.\nAfter forcing the Eagles to punt on the opening second-half possession, New Orleans went on the longest drive of the postseason to that point, covering 92 yards in 18 plays and taking 11:29 off the clock, which included overcoming a 41-yard touchdown completion called back by a holding penalty. Brees made two clutch first down completions on the drive, throwing a 20-yard pass to Thomas on 2nd-and-20 from the Saints' 44-yard line, and later hitting Thomas again for 20 yards to convert a 3rd-and-16. After this, Alvin Kamara's 15-yard run moved the ball to the Eagles' 2-yard line, and Brees completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Thomas on the next play, giving the Saints their first lead of the game at 17–14 with 1:40 left in the third quarter.\nAfter forcing the Eagles to punt, New Orleans drove 62 yards, including a 36-yard run by Mark Ingram II, to take a 20–14 lead on Lutz's 39-yard field goal with 10:28 left. Following another Eagles punt, the Saints drove 41 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 22-yard completion from Brees to Thomas on 3rd-and-13. With 3:03 remaining, they had a chance to put the game away, but Lutz missed a 52-yard field goal attempt wide to the right, giving the ball to Philadelphia on their 42-yard line. After driving to the Saints' 27-yard line, Foles threw a pass that went through the hands of Jeffery and was intercepted by Lattimore with 1:50 remaining, enabling New Orleans to run out the clock.\nBrees finished the game 28-for-38 for 301 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Thomas caught 12 passes for a franchise postseason record 171 yards and a touchdown. Kamara rushed for 71 yards, caught four passes for 35 yards, and returned two kickoffs for 45 yards. Lattimore had eight tackles (four solo) and two interceptions. Foles completed 18-of-31 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. His rushing touchdown made him the third player in the Super Bowl era to have a rushing, receiving and passing touchdown in the postseason.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 20, 2019.\nFor the first time in the Super Bowl era, both conference championship games went into overtime.\nNFC: Los Angeles Rams 26, New Orleans Saints 23 (OT).\nThough the Rams outgained the Saints in total yards 378 to 290, they never held the lead at any point in regulation. But after Greg Zuerlein made a 48-yard field goal with 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime, John Johnson's clutch interception set Zuerlein up for a 57-yard field goal (the second longest in postseason history) to win the game.\nNew Orleans took the opening kickoff and drove 56 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 21-yard completion from Drew Brees to running back Alvin Kamara. Wil Lutz finished the drive with a 37-yard field goal to give the Saints a 3–0 lead. Then Saints linebacker Demario Davis intercepted a pass that bounced out of the hands of running back Todd Gurley, giving his team a first down on the Rams' 13-yard line. Three plays later, Lutz kicked a 29-yard field goal to put New Orleans up 6–0. Los Angeles was quickly forced to punt, and the Saints soon drove for more points. Brees started his next drive with a 24-yard completion to tight end Josh Hill, and later converted a 3rd-and-3 with a 19-yard pass to Michael Thomas. Brees eventually finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown toss to tight end Garrett Griffin, who had been promoted from the practice squad just two weeks earlier after missing the entire regular season. This gave New Orleans a 13–0 lead with 1:35 left in the first quarter.\nThe Rams took the ball back and soon faced 4th-and-5, but managed to keep the drive going with a fake punt in which punter Johnny Hekker threw the ball to Sam Shields for 12 yards, giving the Rams a first down for the first time in the game with 14 minutes left in the second quarter. The possession ended up going on for 14 plays and 62 yards before Zuerlein finished it with a 36-yard field goal to make the score 13–3. After the next three possessions of the game ended in punts, Los Angeles got the ball with 1:52 left in the half. Quarterback Jared Goff started the drive with a pair of completions to Josh Reynolds for 22 total yards. Following two incompletions, he converted a 3rd-and-10 with a 17-yard pass to Brandin Cooks. On the next play, Goff completed a 36-yard pass to Cooks on the Saints' 6-yard line. Gurley then ran the ball in for a touchdown, cutting the Rams' deficit to 13–10 at halftime.\nAfter forcing the Rams to punt on the opening possession of the second half, New Orleans drove 71 yards in 12 plays, mainly on the strength of running backs Mark Ingram II and Kamara. Ingram rushed three times for 25 yards on the drive, while Kamara had a 6-yard carry while also catching four passes for 34 yards. Brees ended the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Taysom Hill, increasing the Saints' lead to 20–10. Los Angeles responded by moving the ball 70 yards in 10 plays, including a 25-yard reception by Cooks and a 16-yard run by Reynolds on an end around play. With 3 minutes left in the third quarter, Goff converted a 3rd-and-goal with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Higbee, cutting the Rams' deficit to 20–17.\nThe next three drives of the game resulted in punts, the last one a 44-yard kick by Thomas Morstead that pinned the Rams back on their 9-yard line. Goff then completed passes to Gerald Everett and Reynolds for gains of 39 and 33 yards as the team drove 90 yards in nine plays. Zuerlein kicked a field goal to tie the score 20–20 with just over five minutes left in regulation. Kamara returned the following kickoff 30 yards to the Rams' 35-yard line. Four plays later, Brees completed a 43-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Los Angeles 13-yard line. Two plays later, with the Saints facing 3rd-and-10, Brees threw a pass to receiver Tommylee Lewis, who was covered by Nickell Robey-Coleman. A hit by Robey-Coleman knocked Lewis to the ground and the pass fell incomplete. Replays showed that Robey-Coleman made contact with Lewis long before the ball arrived. However, no flag was thrown and the Saints had to settle for Lutz's third field goal, from 31 yards, which gave them a 23–20 lead with 1:26 remaining. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Goff completed a 19-yard pass to Reynolds and then threw a 16-yard pass to Robert Woods to convert a 3rd-and-3 and give Los Angeles the ball on the Saints' 33-yard line. Three plays later, Zuerlein's 48-yard field goal tied the score with 8 seconds left on the clock and sent the game into overtime.\nNew Orleans got the ball at the start of overtime and drove to their 40-yard line. On the next play, Ingram was tackled by Aaron Donald for a 6-yard loss. Then as Brees attempted to make a desperate throw, he was hit by Rams lineman Dante Fowler, resulting in a high floating pass that was intercepted by John Johnson at the Rams' 46-yard line. Goff started Los Angeles' ensuing drive with a 12-yard pass to Higbee. Then after Anderson was dropped for a 3-yard loss, Goff's 6-yard pass to Higbee moved the ball to the Saints' 39-yard line. Goff's next pass was incomplete, and Zuerlein was brought out to kick a 57-yard field goal, which he did to give the Rams a 26–23 win.\nAfter the game, Saints coach Sean Payton protested bitterly about the non-call after Robey-Coleman's hit on Lewis on the final play of the Saints' fourth-quarter field goal drive. \"For a call like that not to be made, man, it's just hard to swallow. And then to get a phone call ...\" Payton said, trailing off. He added: \"We spoke initially, then I called to follow up. And the first thing [head of officials Alberto Riveron] said when I got on the phone—'We messed it up.' Payton later said it was the type of foul you'd call \"if we were playing pickup football in the backyard.\" Eight days later, the NFL released a statement officially admitting the play was blown and should have been penalized.\nTwo Saints season ticket holders filed a lawsuit against the NFL over the incident, attempting to force the league to use its unfair act provisions and replay the game from the point of the missed call. The league, which has never used these provisions, opposed the action on the grounds that it could force the Super Bowl to be postponed. On January 31, 2019, U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan in New Orleans ruled that the ticket holders could not compel the NFL or NFL Commissioner to enforce a rule that would change the result of the game or schedule a replay of the game. In response, Louisianans boycotted Super Bowl LIII. In the following season, the NFL changed their rules to allow pass interference calls (and non-calls) to be subject to replay challenge.\nGoff completed 25-of-40 passes for 297 yards, a touchdown and an interception, while also rushing for 10 yards. Cooks caught seven passes for 107 yards, while Reynolds caught four passes for 74 yards and rushed for 16 yards. Rams linebacker Cory Littleton had 12 tackles (11 solo). Brees completed 26-of-40 passes for 249 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Kamara rushed for 15 yards, caught 11 passes for 96 yards, and had four kickoff returns for 119 yards.\nThe previous postseason meeting of these two teams was in the when the Saints eliminated the Rams 31–28; at the time Rams were based in St. Louis and were the defending Super Bowl champions.\nAFC: New England Patriots 37, Kansas City Chiefs 31 (OT).\nNew England outgained the Chiefs in total yards 524–290, and managed to prevent their defense, which led the league in sacks during the season, from getting any sacks in this game. Still, it would take an overtime touchdown by Rex Burkhead to put Kansas City away after a wild, back and forth fourth quarter in which the teams combined to score 38 points as the lead changed four times.\nThe Patriots dominated the first half, holding Kansas City scoreless and limiting them to just 32 total yards. On the game's opening drive, New England running back Sony Michel rushed 6 times for 32 yards as the team drove 80 yards in 15 plays to score on his 1-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, the Patriots drove to a 1st-and-goal from the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but this time they failed to score. On 3rd down, linebacker Reggie Ragland intercepted Tom Brady's pass in the end zone for a touchback with 13:45 left in the half. After a few punts, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes completed a 42-yard pass to Tyreek Hill on the Patriots' 23-yard line. On 3rd-and-9, Mahomes was sacked by Trey Flowers for a 14-yard loss, pushing Kansas City back to the 36-yard line, where they decided to punt rather than risk a long field goal attempt. Dustin Colquitt's 26-yard punt pinned New England back on their own 10-yard line; they still managed to drive to a 14–0 lead, with Brady completing a 30-yard pass to running back James White before hooking up with Phillip Dorsett for a 29-yard scoring play with 27 seconds left in the half.\nThe Chiefs managed to rally back on the opening drive of the second half. When faced with 3rd-and-2 after two plays, Mahomes burned the Patriots' defense with a 54-yard completion to Sammy Watkins, and followed it up with a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Travis Kelce, making the score 14–7. Later in the quarter, New England receiver Julian Edelman returned a punt 13 yards to the Chiefs' 37-yard line, setting up Stephen Gostkowski's 47-yard field goal that increased the Patriots' lead to 17–7. Kansas City responded by driving 75 yards in 9 plays, featuring Mahomes' 33-yard completion to running back Damien Williams. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Williams finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown reception, cutting the score to 17–14.\nNew England took the ball back and advanced to a 4th-and-1 on the Chiefs' 25-yard line. They attempted to convert with a run by Burkhead, but safety Daniel Sorensen broke through the line and tackled him for no gain. However, Kansas City soon had to punt. Officials ruled that Edelman muffed the punt and the Chiefs recovered the ball, but the call was overturned via video review. Two plays later, Brady threw a pass that bounced off Edelman's fingertips and was intercepted by Sorensen, who returned it 14 yards to the Patriots' 23-yard line. Following an incompletion, Mahomes threw a short pass to Williams, who raced down the left sideline for a 23-yard touchdown completion, giving Kansas City their first lead at 21–17, with 7:45 left in regulation. New England then drove 75 yards in 10 plays to retake the lead at 24–21, the longest being a 14-yard run by Burkhead, capped off with Michel's 10-yard touchdown run from 4th-and-inches. The Patriots' touchdown drive was kept alive by a controversial roughing the passer call against Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones, so instead of third-and-long the Patriots got 15 yards and a first down. Following the Patriots' touchdown, Kansas City quickly took advantage of a lost fumble that was eliminated due to a holding penalty on Patriots defensive back J. C. Jackson, and a later pass interference penalty on Jackson that gained them 23 yards. Mahomes then threw a 38-yard completion to Watkins on the 2-yard line, and Williams ran the ball in for a touchdown on the next play; Kansas City led 28–24 with just over two minutes left in regulation.\nCordarrelle Patterson returned the ensuing kickoff 38 yards to the 35-yard line. Then Brady threw passes to Edelman and Chris Hogan for gains of 20 and 11 yards; Hogan's one-handed catch was upheld on review. After an incompletion, Chiefs defensive back Charvarius Ward appeared to put the game away with an interception, only to see it overturned by a penalty against linebacker Dee Ford, who had lined up in the neutral zone before the ball was snapped. On the next play, Brady threw a 25-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski on the Kansas City 4-yard line. Then Burkhead scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, giving New England a 31–28 lead with 39 seconds left. After Tremon Smith's 26-yard kickoff return gave the Chiefs the ball on their 31-yard line, Mahomes completed a 21-yard pass to running back Spencer Ware, and a 27-yard completion to Demarcus Robinson, to set up Harrison Butker's 39-yard field goal with six seconds left, sending the game into overtime, the first such instance in an AFC Championship game since .\nAfter winning the overtime coin toss, New England drove 75 yards in 13 plays for the game-winning touchdown. Edelman caught two third-down passes on the drive for gains of 20 and 15 yards, while Burkhead covered the final 15 yards to the end zone with a 10-yard run, a 3-yard run, and a 2-yard rushing touchdown.\nBrady completed 30-of-46 passes for 348 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. Edelman caught seven passes for 98 yards and returned three punts for 38 yards. Patterson returned 3 kickoffs for 80 yards and caught 2 passes for 16 yards. Michel was the top rusher of the game with 29 carries for 113 yards and two touchdowns. This gave him five total rushing touchdowns for the postseason, a rookie record. Linebacker Kyle Van Noy had 10 tackles (2 solo), two sacks and a forced fumble. Mahomes finished the game 16-of-31 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for 11 yards. Williams rushed for 30 yards, caught five passes for 66 yards, and scored three touchdowns. Watkins was the game's leading receiver with four receptions for 114 yards. Smith had four kickoff returns for 99 yards. Sorensen had 14 tackles (11 solo) and an interception. After the game, the Chiefs fired defensive coordinator Bob Sutton.\nThis was the Patriots' first postseason win on the road since 2006.\nSuper Bowl LIII: New England Patriots 13, Los Angeles Rams 3.\nThis was the first Super Bowl since 2012 to not feature a top seed from either conference, and the first time that both number two seeds qualified. This was the Patriots' third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. The Rams last made an appearance in 2001 when the team was based in St. Louis, coincidentally, facing the Patriots, their first as a Los Angeles based team since 1979. The Patriots won that game 20–17 on a field goal, as time expired, by Adam Vinatieri. The Patriots' current head coach–starting quarterback tandem of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady were only active personnel left from the previous title game against the Rams. The Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl in 18 years (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016), and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most Super Bowl wins. The Rams won their only Super Bowl in 1999, which was coincidentally hosted by Atlanta, and extended their drought to 20 years. This was the Patriots' 11th Super Bowl appearance (ninth under Brady and Belichick) and the Rams' fourth. The first half was the lowest scoring half (three points) since Super Bowl IX (two points). In the lowest scoring Super Bowl in NFL history, the Patriots won 13–3 to claim their sixth Super Bowl.\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games were broadcast nationally on network television.\nIn a change from previous Wild Card Weekends, NBC aired the late Sunday afternoon NFC game as a lead-in to their coverage of the Golden Globe Awards. ABC and ESPN simulcasted the AFC wild card game on Saturday afternoon, Fox aired the Saturday primetime NFC game, and CBS broadcast the other AFC playoff game in the early Sunday window.\nFox then had both NFC divisional games, while CBS and NBC had one AFC divisional game each. Fox had exclusive coverage of the NFC Championship Game. CBS had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LIII."

The complex opened in the spring of 2001 as the Trojan Oaks Tennis Complex. It was renamed the Jimmy C. Lunsford Tennis Complex a few years later in honor of the City of Troy's mayor by the same name who played a key role in getting the facility built. It is a first-class, full-service facility, offering 12 lighted hard courts with a clubhouse and pro shop.\nThe facility is one of the largest on-campus tennis facilities in the Sun Belt Conference.\nTennis lessons, clinics, and tournaments are all offered at the venue. The facility is owned equally between the City of Troy, Troy University and the Troy City School System.\nThe courts play host to the Troy University tennis teams and the Charles Henderson High School tennis teams. The courts have also played host to the USTA Tennis Classic of Troy, a $25,000 professional ITF Women's Circuit tournament. Well-known players in the WTA to have participated in the tournaments are Varvara Lepchenko, Melanie Oudin, Shenay Perry, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Angela Haynes, and Ahsha Rolle. The tennis complex has also hosted the Sun Belt Shootout over recent years."

        "title": "Surfing in New Zealand",
        "text": "New Zealand is a popular surfing destination, with a long history of the sport and a varied coastline with locations suitable for all types of surfing. The West coast is notably consistent, with big swells and high winds, whereas the east coast is dominated by cyclone season swells; the North island is notably warmer than the South, but less consistent; mean temperatures range from 7 °C to 20 °C, depending on location and time of year. Winter is more consistent than Summer, with a southeasterly swell. The climate of New Zealand is varied, so different surf conditions are encountered across the islands.\nHistory.\nSurfing was a part of Māori culture before the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century. The practice was called \"whakahekeheke\", and was carried out using a variety of craft, including boards, or \"kopapa\", and even bags of southern bull-kelp (\"pōhā\"). The influence of Christian missionaries led to a noted decline in surfing.\nIt was later revived following a tour of New Zealand by Hawai'ian surfer Duke Kahanamoku in 1915, when he gave demonstrations to locals. By the 1920s and 1930s, New Zealanders were surfing using solid wooden boards.\nSurfing was utilised in the Surf Lifesaving movement, which used heavy hollow longboards to paddle through the surf. Imported magazines in the 1950s contained plans for longboards, which were improved upon to incorporate features such as a rocker and fin. These boards helped attracted younger members to lifesaving.\nUp until this point, surfing consisted of riding the wave in a straight line perpendicular to the beach. In 1958, two American lifeguards, Bing Copeland and Rick Stoner, came to stay at Piha Surf Lifesaving Club and introduced the concept of surfing across the face of the wave on a smaller board. Copeland and Stoner also helped locals to make copies of their boards, introducing modern surfing and surfboards to New Zealand. These new surfing techniques put more emphasis on the surf conditions, causing surfers to go in search of better locations and conditions, resulting in a decline in the number of surfing lifesavers.\nIn 1963 the first National Surfing Championships was held at Mount Maunganui, followed by the establishment of the New Zealand Surf Riders' Association. In 1966, New Zealand sent its first representative team to the World Surfing Championships in San Diego. By the late 1960s, more surfboard builders were setting up business, using improved technology which resulted in shorter boards. This allowed for greater speed in executing turns and cutbacks. Conflict between surfers and the New Zealand Surf Lifesaving Association over the safety of surfing in close proximity to swimmers was partially resolved by the introduction of \"surf lanes\" and leg ropes.\nGoverning body.\nSurfing New Zealand is the governing body for the sport of surfing in New Zealand. It was established in 1963, and is involved in the organisation of competitions, the development of local training programmes and the education of surfing coaches and judges.\nMāori and surfing.\nWater sports were popular in Māori culture, and considered important for ensuring children were comfortable in water.\nThere are a number of modern surfing clubs and championships which cater to Māori surfers. The \"Auahi Kore Māori Titles\", held since 1992, is a national surfing championship open to Māori contestants in eight categories. The \"Auahi Kore Aotearoa Māori Surfing Team\" compete in the Oceania Surfing Cup, an international surfing championship for indigenous nations of the South Pacific.\nBig-wave surfing.\nThere are limited sites for big-wave surfing in New Zealand, with one exception being the area around Papatowai on the Catlins Coast in the southern South Island.\nCulture.\nAs surfing grew in popularity, the search for the best available conditions led to certain towns and cities becoming centres of the sport, with a distinctive New Zealand surfing culture arising in these areas. These include Raglan, Mt Maunganui and Gisborne in the North Island and Saint Clair and Sumner in the South Island.\nRaglan is particularly known for its consistent surf, and many people visit the small town to learn surfing from one of the local surf schools. Green Wave Raglan is currently the top-rated surf school in the country.\nThere are currently several proposals to construct artificial surfing lagoons, including the Auckland Surf Park, Swell Planet and the Kaiapoi Aquasports Park. \nDemographics.\nIn 1963 there were approximately 300 surfers in the country, but this number grew to an estimated 15,000 by 1967, and estimated 240,000 today."

All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule was not implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6–6 draw.

Nevertheless, they are current holders of the Deaf Ashes.\nInternationally, Deaf Cricketers must have a minimum hearing loss of 55dB in both ears.

Australia, led by opener Chris Ashenden (scored 212), batted quickly to reach 338/5 before declaring with a lead of 214 runs. GB's response was valiant but to no avail with Australia chasing down 88 runs in the final innings without losing a wicket.  \nThe following games ran in a similar fashion with the weather intervening to prevent an Australian whitewash. There were some notable standout performances from the GB side including: Umesh Valjee's 129 runs (first-ever GB test hundred) and 4–81 in the final game; Ross MacCauliffe’ 4–22 in the second game; and Philip Ottaway's 96 in the first game.\n1995: First Deaf ODI World Cup (Victoria, Australia).\nThe first Deaf Cricket World Cup was hosted by Deaf Cricket Australia in Victoria.

After the first game against South Africa was abandoned due to weather, England beat Pakistan by 16 runs in their second game. In an essentially knock-out game between England and India, India was controversially found to be breaking International Deaf Cricket regulations due to a player wearing a hearing aid, which meant they were forced to forfeit and England were through to the final.\nEngland lost to Pakistan in the final at Sharjah Stadium. England batted first scoring 225/6 from 50 overs with contributions from Umesh Valjee (63), Sam Critchard (54) and Paul Allen (45*).

        "text": "The 2011 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 28th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2011 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 5, 2011, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky with a purse of $5,000,000.\nDrosselmeyer, a 15-1 longshot who was in tenth place with a quarter mile left in the race, closed rapidly and won by a length and a half over another longshot, Game On Dude. With none of the favorites finishing in the top three, the superfecta paid $41,631.80.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nThe field for the Classic lacked in star power, especially when compared to the 2010 running featuring Zenyatta and Blame. However, the field was very deep with most of the entries given a legitimate chance of winning. The leading contenders included:\nRace Description.\nGame On Dude went to the lead but was challenged by Uncle Mo. The two set moderate early fractions, followed closely by a large pack of challengers. Turning into the stretch, Uncle Mo hit the lead but then faded, eventually finishing tenth. Game On Dude then repelled challenges from To Honor and Serve and So You Think, opening up a one length lead in mid-stretch. Meanwhile, Drosselmeyer had raced near the back of the field, over ten lengths behind the leaders. He started to make up ground around the far turn but was still in tenth place with a quarter of a mile remaining. Swinging wide, he put in a burst of speed and swept past Game On Dude in the final strides, winning by a length and a half.\nOne of the biggest stories after the race centered on the fact that Drosselmeyer's jockey Mike Smith had once been engaged to Sutherland on Game On Dude. Sutherland had thought she would win, only to see Smith move past her near the finish line. \"I'm very proud of my horse, very proud of myself. I had an amazing time,\" she said after the race. \"And I'm happy for Mike. But really? Really? Of all people.\"\nFor Smith, it was a \"redemption\" of sorts after the defeat of Zenyatta the year before. \"Compared to last year, this is incredible.

        "text": "The 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2017–18 season. The playoffs began on April 11, 2018, after the regular season, and they concluded on June 7, 2018, with the Washington Capitals winning their first Stanley Cup in franchise history by defeating the Vegas Golden Knights four games to one in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Nashville Predators made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Pittsburgh Penguins increased their post-season appearance streak to twelve seasons, the current longest streak.\nThe Vegas Golden Knights became the first team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league since the 1979–80 Hartford Whalers and the Edmonton Oilers. They also became the first expansion team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season since the 1967 NHL expansion. From there, they eventually became the first team since the 1967–68 St. Louis Blues to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. The only difference is that the 1967–68 season through to the 1969–70 season ensured that an expansion team would be able to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. For the fourth time in league history (2000, 2001, 2007), only two Original Six teams, the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, clinched a berth for the playoffs. For the first time since 1966, no playoff games were played in the state of New York.\nFor the fifth time in eight years, all three California-based teams made the playoffs. For the first time in league history, the Montreal Canadiens and the Detroit Red Wings missed the playoffs in the same year. For the first time since 1969, both the Chicago Blackhawks and the Detroit Red Wings missed the playoffs in the same season. For the first time since 2009, no California-based team reached the conference finals.\nThe playoffs featured ten overtime games, the fewest since 2000. This was also the first time since 1997 that no games played in either the Conference finals or Stanley Cup Finals went to overtime.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the fifth year in which the top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed. Thereafter, it was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (WC2) New Jersey Devils.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning finished first in the Atlantic Division earning 113 points. New Jersey finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild card, earning 97 points. This was the third playoff meeting between these teams with New Jersey winning both previous series. They last met in the 2007 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which New Jersey won in six games. New Jersey won all three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Devils in five games. Although Taylor Hall scored his first playoff goal in game one, the Devils were beaten 5–2 as Ondrej Palat recorded three points for Tampa Bay. In game two, a four-goal barrage by the Lightning during the second period forced Devils goaltender Keith Kinkaid to be pulled. Tampa won the game 5–3. The Devils recovered in game three as Taylor Hall scored a goal and two assists in a 5–2 victory. J. T. Miller and Nikita Kucherov both had three points in a 3–1 victory for the Lightning in game four. In game five, Kucherov's goal was the series-winner as the Lightning held off a late attack by the Devils to win 3–1.\n(A2) Boston Bruins vs. (A3) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Boston Bruins finished second in the Atlantic Division earning 112 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 105 points to finish third in the Atlantic Division. This was the fifteenth playoff meeting between these two teams with Toronto winning eight of the fourteen previous series. They last met in the 2013 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Boston won in seven games. Toronto won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Bruins defeated the Maple Leafs in seven games. Tuukka Rask made 26 saves for the Bruins in game one, winning the game 5–1. During the game, Maple Leafs forward Nazem Kadri was given a five-minute major for a charging penalty for his hit on Tommy Wingels; he would later be suspended for three games.

Columbus came back from a two-goal deficit in game one to force overtime, during which Artemi Panarin scored 6:02 into the extra session to give the Blue Jackets their first lead in a playoff series. The Blue Jackets overcame another two-goal deficit in game two, taking the game into overtime yet again. Matt Calvert scored the game-winning goal for Columbus as they took a 2–0 series lead. The Capitals took game three 3–2 in double-overtime as Lars Eller scored the game winner. The Capitals tied the series after game four as Washington's Alexander Ovechkin had a goal and an assist in a 4–1 victory. Nicklas Backstrom's tip-in was the overtime-winner for the Capitals in game five as they prevented a two-goal comeback by the Blue Jackets. In game six, Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin scored twice to seal the series for Washington, winning the affair 6–3. With playoff series victories by Winnipeg and Vegas this season, Columbus became the last active NHL franchise without a playoff series win until they defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2019.\n(M2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (M3) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins finished second in the Metropolitan Division earning 100 points. The Philadelphia Flyers earned 98 points to finish third in the Metropolitan. This was the seventh playoff meeting between these two rivals with Philadelphia winning four of the six previous series. They last met in the 2012 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Philadelphia won in six games. Pittsburgh won all four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Penguins defeated the Flyers in six games. In game one, Sidney Crosby capped off a hat trick to end a 7–0 rout over the Flyers. The Flyers defeated the Penguins in game two, riding on Sean Couturier's goal and two assists in a 5–1 victory. Pittsburgh took game three 5–1 as Crosby recorded a goal and three assists. Matt Murray recorded his second shutout of the series in game four, stopping all 26 shots he faced in a 5–0 victory for Pittsburgh.

In game six, Sean Couturier recorded a hat trick for the Flyers whilst on a torn MCL. However, Jake Guentzel's natural hat trick, with four goals in total, including two within ten seconds of each other, sealed the series for the Penguins in an 8–5 victory.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) Nashville Predators vs. (WC2) Colorado Avalanche.\nThe Nashville Predators earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team with 117 points. The Colorado Avalanche finished as the Western Conference's second wild card earning 95 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Nashville won all four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Predators defeated the Avalanche in six games. Filip Forsberg scored twice in Nashville's 5–2 game one victory, one of which was considered a highlight-reel goal. Nashville had five different players score in their 5–4 victory over Colorado in game two to take a 2–0 series lead.

Winnipeg won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Jets defeated the Wild in five games and earned their first playoff series victory in franchise history after entering the league in 1999 as the Atlanta Thrashers. The Jets also became the first Winnipeg-based NHL team to advance past the opening round of the playoffs since 1987. After firing 40 shots on Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk, the Jets won game one 3–2, winning their first playoff game in franchise history and the city's first playoff victory since 1996, after which the original Jets relocated to Phoenix. In game two, Patrik Laine had a goal and an assist to provide the Jets a 4–1 victory as well as a 2–0 series lead.

In game one, Marc-Andre Fleury stopped all 30 shots to give the Golden Knights their first playoff victory.

In addition, the 7 goals scored by Vegas is the lowest amount by a series-winning team in NHL history.\n(P2) Anaheim Ducks vs. (P3) San Jose Sharks.\nThe Anaheim Ducks finished second in the Pacific Division earning 101 points.

This was the first time since 2003 where two teams were making their conference finals debut. The Jets advanced to the conference finals for the first time in their 19th year (seventh in Winnipeg) after entering the league in 1999 as the Atlanta Thrashers; they also became the first Winnipeg-based team in league history to make it past the second round.

Vegas made their Finals debut in their inaugural season, becoming the first team since the aforementioned St. Louis Blues to make the Finals in their first season. Washington made their second Finals appearance. Their only previous appearance in the Finals ended in a four-game sweep by the Detroit Red Wings in 1998. This was the first Finals since 2007 to feature two teams that had not previously won a Stanley Cup. Vegas won both games in this year's regular season series.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nThis was the seventh postseason under NBC Sports' current 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games was aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. Due to original programming commitments involving CNBC and USA Network, two first round games on April 18 were aired by Golf Channel. During the first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games. For the second year, the first round national broadcasts were not blacked out on television in the markets of participating teams, and could co-exist with the local broadcasts (however, NBC-provided coverage was restricted in Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, where AT&amp;T SportsNet holds the regional rights to the Penguins and the Golden Knights respectively).\nIn Canada, for the fourth postseason under Rogers Media's current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live. The Winnipeg Jets' first round series against the Minnesota Wild was assigned to Sportsnet, due to the Maple Leafs' series being prioritized to CBC, and to encourage subscription to the network since it is not carried on basic cable in Winnipeg.\nIn a surprise move, Sportsnet did not give any on-air assignments to Bob Cole during the playoffs—an exclusion that caught the veteran commentator off-guard. Instead, Sportsnet replaced Cole with Calgary Flames announcer Rick Ball, joining Jim Hughson, Paul Romanuk and Dave Randorf on play-by-play during the first two rounds of the playoffs. It was subsequently announced that Cole would retire from broadcasting the following season.\nFuelled by viewer interest in the Golden Knights' inaugural season and playoff run, and in Canada, the deep playoff run of the Winnipeg Jets, viewership of these playoffs saw noticeable increases. NBC reported that viewership of the conference finals collectively saw a 15% increase over 2017, with an average cross-platform viewership of 1.841 million (23% increase year-over-year) for the Western Conference finals featuring the Golden Knights, game one of said series (televised on NBC) seen by 2.374 viewers total, and game seven of the Lightning/Capitals Eastern Conference final pulling a 2.14 overnight rating—the highest viewership for a non-overtime game seven since 2015, and the highest cable viewership of the 2018 playoffs to-date. The Jets also contributed to strong viewership numbers in Canada, with Sportsnet reporting an average of 2.2 million across their second-round series."

All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a team had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6–6 draw.

Ecuatorian María Eugenia Guzmán and Brazilian Suzana Petersen, alongside Mexican Cecilia Rosado and Soviet Zaiga Jansone, have all won bronze medals.\nDue to the short draw, 4 out of 5 pairs have won medals, giving the tournament an unusual 80% of chances of winning a medal.\nSeeds.\nBoth seeds received a bye into the semifinals."

        "title": "List of Canadian Stanley Cup Finals television announcers",
        "text": "This is a list of Canadian Stanley Cup Finals television announcers.\nEnglish-language networks.\nCBC's coverage of Games 3, 4 and 5 of the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals were joined in progress at 9:30 p.m. (approximately one hour after start time). Meanwhile, CBC joined Game 6 in at 10 p.m. (again, one hour after start time). Game 7 was carried Dominion wide (nationwide) from opening the face off at 9 p.m. Since Game 7 was played on Good Friday night, there were no commercials (Imperial Oil was the sponsor).\nThe 1961 Stanley Cup Finals were almost not televised in Canada at all. At that time, the CBC only had rights to the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks-Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC found a way to link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch in the coverage.\nTo accommodate the American TV coverage on NBC (1966 marked the first time that a Stanley Cup Finals game was to be nationally broadcast on American network television), Game 1 of the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals was shifted to a Sunday afternoon. This in return, was the first time ever that a National Hockey League game was played on a Sunday afternoon in Montreal. While Games 1 and 4 of the NBC broadcasts were televised in color, CBC carried these games and all other games in black and white.\nThe most commonly seen video clip of Bobby Orr's famous overtime goal (\"The Flight\") in Game 4 of the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals is the American version broadcast on CBS as called by Dan Kelly. This archival clip can be considered a rarity, since about 98% of the time, any surviving kinescopes or videotapes of the actual telecasts of hockey games from this era usually emanate from CBC's coverage. According to Dick Irvin Jr.'s book \"My 26 Stanley Cups\" (Irvin was in the CBC booth with Danny Gallivan during the 1970 Stanley Cup Finals), he was always curious why even the CBC prototypically uses the CBS replay of the Bobby Orr goal (with Dan Kelly's commentary) instead of Gallivan's call. The explanation that Irvin received was that the CBC's master tape of the game (along with others) was thrown away in order clear shelf space at the network.\nIn , \"Hockey Night in Canada\" moved all playoff coverage from CBC to CTV to avoid conflict with the lengthy NABET strike against the CBC. Eventually, MacLaren Advertising, in conjunction with Molson Breweries and Imperial Oil/Esso, who actually owned the rights to \"Hockey Night in Canada\" (not CBC) decided to give the playoff telecast rights to CTV. Initially, it was on a game by game basis in the quarterfinals (Game 1 of the Boston-Toronto series was seen on CFTO Toronto in full while other , but not all joined the game in progress. Game 1 of the New York Rangers–Montreal series was seen only on CFCF Montreal while Game 4 not televised due to a lockout of technicians at the Montreal Forum), and then the full semifinals and Stanley Cup Finals. Because CTV did not have 100% penetration in Canada at this time, they asked CBC (who ultimately refused) to allow whatever one of their affiliates were the sole network in that market to show the playoffs. As a result, the 1972 Stanley Cup playoffs were not seen in some of the smaller Canadian markets unless said markets were close enough to the United States border to pick up the signal of a CBS affiliate that carried Games, 1, 4, or 6 (Games 2, 3 and 5 were not nationally broadcast in the United States).\nIn 1980, Bob Cole, Dan Kelly and Jim Robson shared play-by-play duties for CBC's coverage. Cole did play-by-play for the first half of Games 1 and 2. Meanwhile, Kelly did play-by-play for the second half Games 1–5 (Kelly also did call the overtime period of Game 1). Finally, Robson did play-by-play for first half of Games 3 and 4 and Game 6 entirely. Except for Game 5, Kelly did play-by-play for the first period and first half Games 5, and Jim Robson play-by-play for the rest of Game 5. In essence this meant that Bob Cole or Jim Robson would do play-by-play for the first period and the first half of the second period. Therefore, at the closest stoppage of play near the 10 minute mark of the second period, Cole or Robson handed off the call to Kelly for the rest of the game.\nIn , CBC televised Games 1 and 2 nationally while Games 3–5 were televised in Edmonton only. CTV televised Games 3–5 nationally while games were blacked out in Edmonton. Dan Kelly, Ron Reusch, and Brad Park called the games on CTV. In , CBC only televised Games 1 and 2 in Montreal and Calgary. CBC televised Games 3–5 nationally. When CTV televised Games 1 and 2, both games were blacked out in Montreal and Calgary. Like in the year prior, Dan Kelly, Ron Reusch, and Brad Park called the games for CTV.\nUnlike the split CTV/CBC coverage of and , the Canwest-Global telecasts from - were network exclusive, except for Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals if they were necessary. When CBC and Global televised Game 7 of the 1987 Stanley Cup Finals, they used separate production facilities and separate on-air talent.\nSportsnet gained the national broadcast rights starting in . Under a sub-licensing agreement since the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals, the CBC broadcast has been produced by Sportsnet; all Stanley Cup Finals games have been also simulcast on Sportsnet since ."

After two legs, the team with the most result points advances to the next round. In case the teams are tied after two legs, a is played immediately at the completion of the second leg.

However, reservations were made by the International Ski Federation with regards to the proposed Men's Downhill venue, as a ramp would have been necessary to accommodate the necessary 800 meter vertical drop, whilst barges would be placed along the river St. Lawrence. in order to accommodate a finishing area. An alternative site located inland at Acropole des Draveurs, would have provided the 800 meter vertical, but the site would have required major development. Some locals and government officials flagged the 25 million dollar temporary venue as rather pointless and despite the proposal incorporating a tunnel for a train line which runs along the mountain range.\nOther proposals, such as staging the Men's Downhill events in Calgary were also considered, but deemed unrealistic.\nAftermath.\nDuring the 104th IOC meeting held in Budapest the bid got 7 votes and lost in the first round to Salt Lake City."

In 2013 it was reported that only one league player have played in the VCA's league since its formation and that Vietnam has yet to form a national team for cricket.\nThe association gained sponsorship from Suntory PepsiCo Vietnam Beverage (SPVB) – a strategic alliance between Suntory and PepsiCo. However, in 2015 the company threatened to withdraw sponsorship unless a commitment was made to develop the sport locally. By the end of the year, a strategic roadmap was presented to the Government of Vietnam Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.\nA national team composing Vietnamese natives began to be assembled, drawing mainly from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Sport. Several members of the squad had previous experience in baseball (also a relatively new sport in this part of the world) and two had previously played on the Vietnam national baseball team. The team began playing in the VCA league to gain experience, which had previously been expat-only. Their coach was Australian expat Mick Blinkhoff. By early 2017, in preparation for the SEA Games in August, the national squad members were training five days a week and got a government stipend of VND5 million per week (INR14,148; USD219.5; GBP171.35). The VCA already has one eye on the 2021 Southeast Asian Games, hosted in Hanoi."

Most bagel sets occur in the early rounds of tennis tournaments where the favorites play lower-ranked players, such as lucky losers or wild cards.\nEtymology.\nThe term refers to the similarity between the shape of a zero and the shape of a bagel.

His coaching break came as an assistant to Billy Tubbs at Oklahoma, who hired him away from San Jacinto College. After four years at OU, Newell became head coach at Arkansas–Little Rock, a program that had experienced little success. The Trojans notably upset heavily-favored Notre Dame in the 1986 NCAA tournament. After six seasons in Little Rock, Newell was named head coach at Lamar, on former Cardinals coach Tubbs' recommendation. However, three seasons later Newell resigned under allegations of verbal abuse towards players.\nNewell took several years off from coaching, returning to lead West Alabama in 2011. After two years with the Tigers and nine seasons at Arkansas–Monticello, Newell was hired as head coach at NAIA school Dillard in 2015 following a season where the Bleu Devils won only five games. In only his second season, Newell led the team to a Gulf Coast Athletic Conference title."

        "text": "The 2020 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was a planned single-elimination tournament of 68 teams to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college basketball national champion for the 2019–20 season. The 82nd edition of the tournament would have begun on March 17, 2020, and concluded with the championship game on April 6 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.\nOn March 12, the tournament, as well as all other NCAA championships for the remainder of the academic year, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, just five days before it was set to begin. It was the first time the tournament had been cancelled since its creation in 1939. \nCOVID-19 impact and cancellation.\nThe timing of the tournament coincided with the wider spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On March 10, the Ivy League announced it had cancelled the conference's tournament, and would award its championship and automatic qualification to Yale based on regular season records. Harvard University was scheduled to host the event at Lavietes Pavilion in Boston on March 14 and 15. Some conferences subsequently announced they would go on with their tournaments while holding their games behind closed doors with no outside spectators and limited attendance, especially on March 11 (when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic).\nThe NCAA subsequently announced it would go on with its winter-sport championships, including its basketball tournaments, with attendance limited to essential staff and family members. Some venues (such as those in Ohio and California) enacted further local numerical restrictions on the numbers of those who could attend an event, which the NCAA agreed to respect. Reports also stated that for practicality reasons, the NCAA was considering re-locating some of the later rounds (including the regional finals and the Final Four, the latter scheduled to be held at the 71,000-seat Mercedes-Benz Stadium) to smaller venues within the same host cities.\nOn March 11, hours after the WHO's pandemic declaration, the NBA suspended its regular season after Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with COVID-19. On the same night, Nebraska coach Fred Hoiberg fell visibly ill during a game in the first round of the Big Ten tournament. There were initial fears that Hoiberg had COVID-19, but he was ultimately diagnosed with influenza A. The following day, due in part to Gobert's diagnosis and Hoiberg’s health scare, all conferences that had not yet concluded tournament play announced they would be scrapping their tournaments. Many of them had announced they would play without fans, but it was decided to scrap play altogether. With the decision to cancel the 2020 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament, all games that had yet to be played in the basketball season were cancelled, while the Big East called off its tournament at halftime during a quarter-final game between Creighton and St. John's. Most major conferences also announced suspensions of all athletics to varying degrees. Later in the day, the NCAA announced the tournament would be cancelled, along with all remaining winter and spring championships for the academic year.\nThe NCAA had not ruled out publishing what would have been its at-large selections and bracket. Vice president of men's basketball Dan Gavitt told the Associated Press that he had proposed holding a shortened, 16-team tournament in Atlanta (split between State Farm Arena and Mercedes-Benz Stadium) as an alternative, with all participants chosen by the selection committee, before the decision was made to cancel the entire tournament due to Rudy Gobert's diagnosis. The NCAA ultimately decided against releasing any brackets, with Gavitt stating, \"Brackets based on hypotheticals can’t substitute for a complete selection, seeding and bracketing process.\"\nAs part of a cycle that began in 2016, TBS was scheduled to televise the 2020 Final Four and national championship game. CBS was scheduled to televise the selection show. CBS Sports and Turner Sports announced on March 16 that all technicians and utility staff who were expected to work the \"NCAA March Madness\" coverage would still be paid. Radio rightsholder Westwood One announced plans to offer encores of radio broadcasts from classic NCAA tournament games—accompanied by interviews with notable figures from the respective games—to fill the time slots it had originally devoted to the tournament. CBS similarly announced on March 19 that it would also air nine classic Final Four games across the weekend afternoons of March 21, 22, and 29.\nOriginally scheduled dates, venues, and television coverage.\nPrior to cancellation, fourteen venues had been scheduled to host games in the 2020 tournament:\nFirst Four\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nTwelve teams had automatically qualified for the 2020 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament.\nAll conference tournaments that had not been completed were cancelled, the majority without naming an automatic qualifier. Teams with † next to their names were named automatic qualifiers by their conferences after their tournament was cancelled."

The season began with the pro–am Vienna Snooker Open in May 2017 and ended with the 2018 World Snooker Championship in April the following year. Ronnie O'Sullivan earned a joint-record five ranking titles in the season. He joined Stephen Hendry (1990/1991), Ding Junhui (2013/2014), and Mark Selby (2016/2017) in winning five ranking titles in the same season.\nThe China Championship became a ranking event and was brought forward to a mid-August date, ahead of the Paul Hunter Classic. The Shanghai Masters was initially withdrawn from the season calendar, but was later rescheduled for November 2017. The biennial World Cup team event was played in July 2017. Another event not held every year returning in 2017 was the 2017 IWGA World Games. The Snooker Shoot Out was brought forward to the start of February, ahead of both the World Grand Prix and Welsh Open.\nA new World Seniors Tour was formed by Snooker Legends for players over 40 years of age, comprising four events, including the World Seniors Championship which has returned to Scunthorpe in 2018.\nThe second edition of the Home Nations Series was being held in this season with the English Open, Northern Ireland Open, Scottish Open and Welsh Open tournaments. For a single winner of all four tournaments would earn a bonus of £1 million.\nRonnie O'Sullivan won five ranking events during the season, with Mark Williams winning three times and Ryan Day, John Higgins and Mark Selby each winning twice. Shaun Murphy reached four ranking event finals during the season but lost them all.\nPlayers.\nThe top 64 players from the prize money rankings after the 2017 World Championship, and the 31 players earning a two-year card the previous year automatically qualified for the season (Rouzi Maimaiti has resigned his membership). Next, eight places were allocated to the top 8 on the One Year Ranking List who have not already qualified for the Main Tour. Another two players came from the EBSA Qualifying Tour Play-Offs, and a further places were available through the 2017 Q School, four from each of the two events and the four best-ranked players in the Order of Merit.

        "title": "2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was a single-elimination tournament of 68 teams to determine the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's college basketball national champion for the 2020–21 season. The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana, and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament to date that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.\nThis marked the first time since 1976 that neither Duke nor Kentucky qualified for the tournament. It was also the first time since 1995 that Duke failed to make the tournament, breaking a streak of 24 consecutive appearances. America East champion Hartford and WAC champion Grand Canyon made their NCAA Tournament debuts.\nThe tournament was marked by many upsets, with Yahoo Sports journalist Pete Thamel calling it \"one of the most dizzying NCAA men's tournaments in history\". With only half of the 16 second-round games having been played, there had been 11 upsets to that point, using the NCAA's definition of \"upset\" as a win by a team seeded five or more lines below its defeated opponent. This had already broken the record for most upsets prior to the round of 16; by the end of the second round, this number went up to 12. In addition, at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won a first-round game for the fourth time ever, and the first time since 2016. Also, a record four teams seeded 13 or lower won first-round games. Another notable mark set during the tournament was a record-breaking 14 upsets throughout the event, breaking the original record of 13 upsets from the 1985 and 2014 tournaments.\nThe Final Four game between UCLA and Gonzaga (the first semifinal game to go into overtime since 1998) saw a game-winning buzzer-beater by Jalen Suggs to take Gonzaga into the championship game, the first buzzer-beater in a national semifinal since 1977. By defeating Gonzaga in the championship game, the Baylor Bears became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the Virginia Cavaliers in 2019. The last time this happened was in 2002 and 2003, when the Maryland Terrapins and Syracuse Orange (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in 1966.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2021 tournament, with 31 of them (down from 32, due to the Ivy League having canceled all winter semester sports due to COVID-19) having received an automatic bid by winning their conference's tournament. The remaining 37 bids were \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. Teams met sport sponsorship requirements and were considered for NCAA championship selection if they played 13 games, which represented a 50 percent reduction of the current minimum. For NCAA championship consideration, all 13 games had to be against other Division I opponents. Teams could also play 12 regular-season games against Division I opponents and one conference tournament game to be eligible for tournament consideration.\nThe Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 68. The four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams played in the First Four round: for the 2021 tournament, the games were played between the overall 65th and 66th seeds, the 67th and 68th seed, and the last four at-large seeds.\nThe top four teams outside of the ranking (commonly known as the \"first four out\" in pre-tourney analyses) acted as standbys in the event a school was forced to withdraw from the tournament due to COVID-19 protocols. However, if a team withdrew within 48 hours of the tournament's commencement, they would not be replaced; the bracket was not reseeded, and the affected team's opponent would automatically advance to the next round.The replacement teams are as follows, in order: \nSchedule and venues.\nOn January 4, 2021, the NCAA announced that due to logistical considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (which prompted the cancellation of the 2020 tournament), the entirety of the tournament would be conducted at sites within the Indianapolis metro area and central Indiana, rather than across the country. Players stayed at hotels near the Indiana Convention Center, which served as the main practice facility. Lucas Oil Stadium had two courts named \"Unity Court\" and \"Equality Court\" during the First Round, Second Round, and Elite Eight.\nOn February 19, it was announced that all venues would operate at a maximum of 25% capacity. As this capacity includes staff and players, the exact number of spectators varied by venue. Artificial crowd noise was used at all venues to augment the limited in-person attendance.\nThis tournament marked the first time ever that Indiana Farmers Coliseum was a tournament venue, the first time since 2017 that Bankers Life Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1940 that Hinkle Fieldhouse was a tournament venue, the first time since 1980 that Mackey Arena was a tournament venue, and the first time since 1981 that Assembly Hall was a tournament venue.\nFirst Four:\nFirst and Second Rounds:\nRegional Semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight):\nNational Semifinals and Championship (Final Four and Championship):\nOriginal 2021 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues.\nThe following sites were originally selected to host each round of the 2021 tournament; with the exceptions of Boise and Minneapolis, all cities and venues listed are scheduled to host tournament games after 2021:\nFirst Four\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional Semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational Semifinals and Championship (Final Four and Championship)\nQualification and selection.\nTournament seeds.\n&lt;section begin=\"RegionSeeds\" /&gt;\nThe tournament seeds and regions were determined through the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.\nIn contrast to previous years, the S-Curve used to establish overall seeds will also be used as primary determinant of the tournament bracket; this was made possible by the relatively condensed locations of this year's tournament making geographic concerns irrelevant. However, rules that can modify pairings to avoid early rematches and to distribute top conference representatives to different regions will remain in effect.\n&lt;section end=\"RegionSeeds\" /&gt;\nTournament bracket.\n\"Note: Unlike past tournaments, teams are not grouped as pods.

Bryant was eliminated in the First Four by Wright State, and Longwood was eliminated by Tennessee in the first round.\nA major upset occurred on the first full day of the tournament, when 15-seed Saint Peter's upset 2-seed Kentucky, and subsequently became the third 15-seed to reach the Sweet 16 (the second consecutive year in which this occurred and third in the last nine years) and the first ever 15-seed to advance to the Elite Eight. This was the tenth time a 15-seed defeated a 2-seed overall, but it was the sixth time since 2012 this occurred.

This is due to its tendency to move unpredictably in mid-flight, similar to the knuckleball in baseball. This occurs due to the absence of any spin applied to the delivery, thus leaving the ball subject to the vagaries of spin-less flight through the air.\nThe delivery was first used by the Bangladesh national cricket team, in particular by bowler Rubel Hossain. He and others reportedly received the guidance of bowling coach Ian Pont in developing the delivery. Similar deliveries lacking spin have, however, been used before the Projapoti’s christening, including by medium pace bowler Zaheer Khan."

The larger barges were seaworthy vessels, and were the largest sailing vessel to be handled by just two men.\nThe average size was about 120 tons and they carried of canvas sail in six working sails. The mainsail was loose-footed and set up with a sprit, and was brailed to the mast when not needed. It is sheeted to a horse, as are the foresails so need no attention when going about. The topsail was the main working sail in heavy weather, the upper reaches of the rivers and constricted harbours. It is controlled from the deck by halliards, in-hauls and sheets. The mizzen boom is sheeted down to the rudder- assisting the helm. The masts are mounted in tabernacles so they can be lowered to shoot bridges with little loss of headway. The bowsprit where fitted could be 'topped' where space was limited.\nList of Thames barges illustrated by images on Commons.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nG\nH\nI\nL\nM\nN\nP\nR\nS\nT\nV\nW\nX\nList of Thames barges sailing built in 2019.\nSnark (2016-9)"

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Carol I is a monument in Romania, situated in the central zone of Bucharest, on Calea Victoriei.\nThe massive statue, cast in bronze, represents Carol I of Romania, the first King of Romania, mounted on his horse. The founder of the Romanian Dynasty, during his reign Romania conquered its independence from the Ottoman Empire, in 1877, in the course the Russo-Turkish War, known in Romania as the War of Independence.\nThe statue is located on Calea Victoriei and stands in Piața Palatului (a square that was renamed \"The Revolution Square\" after the bloody events of 1989, opposite the National Museum of Art of Romania (the former royal palace) and in front of the Central University Library, Bucharest.\nThe old King Carol I statue by Ivan Meštrović.\nThe first equestrian statue of King Carol I in Bucharest was created in 1939 by the Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović. The inauguration was held on Romania's National Day of May 10, 1939. Because the monument stood in a large square opposite the Royal Palace, it witnessed many significant events of the inter-war era and during World War II, becoming one of the well-known visual symbols of Bucharest, present on numerous photos, postcards, etc.\nIn the night of December 30/31, 1947, after King Michael I abdicated the throne, the Communist government demolished the statue—an important visual symbol of monarchy—from its pedestal. The statue was destroyed in 1948.\nThe new King Carol I statue by Florin Codre.\nIn 2007, 18 years after the Romanian anti-Communist Revolution, the Bucharest City Hall decided to recreate the destroyed statue and locate it at the original place. A small-scale model of Meštrović's original work was in possession of the sculptor's family, but an agreement was never signed, due to City Hall's inability to meet the financial requirements.\nRomanian sculptor Florin Codre was tasked to create a new statue, visually similar to Meštrović's, but not an exact copy.\nThe inauguration of the new statue took place on December 6, 2010, with Princess Margareta of Romania, heiress of the Romanian Royal Family an her husband, Prince Radu, assisting. The Mayor of Bucharest, Sorin Oprescu, was present, as well as academicians Constantin Bălăceanu-Stolnici, ex-Presidents Ion Iliescu and Emil Constantinescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. A message from the former king Michael I was read on the occasion.\nSince then, the statue has regained its public significance as a tourist sightseeing place in Bucharest. Various public events are periodically held in front of it, especially the annual festivity of May 10, connected with several events related to Romanian monarchy: Carol I's first arrival in Bucharest (in 1866), Carol's formal approval of the declaration of independence proclaimed on May 9, 1877, and Carol I's coronation as King of Romania (in 1881).\nPossible survival of the old King Carol I statue.\nThere are rumors that the old statue of King Carol I is currently buried in front of the Palace of Agriculture in Brăila, where Soviet occupying forces would have located it during World War II.\nIt is also possible that the house of the equestrian statue was used for another statue for the Russian general Alexander Suvorov located in Dragosloveni, but this is not confirmed."

        "text": "On June 14, 2017, a mass shooting occurred during a practice session for the annual Congressional Baseball Game in Alexandria, Virginia. 66-year-old James Hodgkinson shot six people, including U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, U.S. Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner, congressional aide Zack Barth, and lobbyist Matt Mika. A ten-minute shootout took place between Hodgkinson and officers from the Capitol and Alexandria Police before officers shot Hodgkinson, who died from his wounds later that day at the George Washington University Hospital. Scalise and Mika were taken to nearby hospitals where they underwent surgery.\nHodgkinson was a left-wing activist with a record of domestic violence from Belleville, Illinois, while Scalise was a Republican Party member of Congress. The Virginia Attorney General concluded Hodgkinson's attack was \"an act of terrorism ... fueled by rage against Republican legislators.\" Scalise was the first sitting member of Congress to have been shot since Arizona Representative Democratic Gabby Giffords in the 2011 Tucson shooting. In a 2021 report, the FBI classified the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism, and the perpetrator of the shooting as a \"domestic violent extremist\" with a \"personalized violent ideology\".\nBackground.\nThe shooting took place on June 14, 2017, at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. There were 24 Republican congressmen who had gathered at the park to practice for the next day's Congressional Baseball Game for Charity, an annual, bipartisan event first held in 1909. Among those at the practice, aside from Scalise, were Senators Rand Paul and Jeff Flake, and Representatives Roger Williams (the team's coach), Chuck Fleischmann, Trent Kelly, Mo Brooks, Brad Wenstrup, Rodney Davis, Jeff Duncan, Jack Bergman, Mike Bishop and Joe Barton (the team's manager).\nPrior to the game, the Republicans had held practices at the same time and place each morning. The team began its practice around 6:30 a.m. EDT that day. According to Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, they were approached before the shooting at the practice by a man who asked whether Republicans or Democrats were practicing on the field. Duncan reportedly replied that it was the Republican team. DeSantis later told reporters that both he and Duncan believe that the man was the perpetrator of the shooting, James Hodgkinson. Three U.S. Capitol Police officers were present at the practice to protect Scalise, who, due to his House leadership position, had a full-time security detail assigned to protect him. They were posted behind the first-base dugout on that day.\nShooting.\nThe practice had been underway for about half an hour when James Hodgkinson began firing. According to the Capitol Police, he was armed with an SKS rifle and a 9mm Smith &amp; Wesson handgun, both of which he had purchased legally. It was unclear if Hodgkinson used the handgun during the shooting incident. When Hodgkinson opened fire, two of the officers, David Bailey and Crystal Griner, rushed onto the field to protect the congressmen and the other civilians. Hodgkinson sought cover behind the third base dugout as the third Capitol Police officer, Henry Cabrera, took aim at him from behind the first base dugout. At 7:09 am, the Alexandria Police received a 9-1-1 report of shots fired. Two police officers arrived within three minutes and also engaged Hodgkinson in a gunfight. Witnesses estimated between 50 and 100 shots were fired during the shootout, which lasted about 10 minutes before Hodgkinson was mortally wounded by Alexandria Police officers Nicole Battaglia, Alexander Jensen and Kevin Jobe and Capitol Police officers Bailey and Griner.\nScalise, who was at second base when the shooting started, was shot in the hip and tried to drag himself off the field. While the shooting was still going on, Representative Mo Brooks used his belt as a tourniquet to help stop bleeding for a staffer who had been shot in the calf. After the shooting ended, Brooks and Representative Brad Wenstrup—a podiatrist and U.S. Army Reservist who served with the U.S. Army's 344th Combat Support Hospital—were able to assist Scalise. Several witnesses said their lives were saved by the presence of the Capitol Police, who were there because of Scalise's position as the House Majority Whip. The Capitol Police immediately engaged Hodgkinson and kept him pinned down, preventing him from continuing to fire on the unarmed baseball players. Representative Davis and Senator Rand Paul separately said that if not for the presence of the officers, the incident \"would have been a massacre\".\nInjuries.\nScalise was shot in the hip and was evacuated by a U.S. Park Police helicopter to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where he underwent surgery. The hospital reported that after the bullet struck his hip, it traveled across his pelvis—fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding. His condition was initially listed as \"critical\". He received multiple blood transfusions and underwent several surgeries to repair internal damage and stop the bleeding. His condition was improved to \"serious\" on June 17. It further improved to \"fair\" on June 21, though he was readmitted to intensive care on July 5 due to concerns of infection.\nMatt Mika, a Tyson Foods lobbyist, was shot multiple times in the chest and arm, injuring his lungs, sternum, and ribs. He is a former baseball player and former legislative assistant for Congressmen Tim Walberg and Dave Camp, both Republicans from Michigan. Paramedics from the Alexandria Fire Department labeled Mika as the most severely wounded, a red case, and he was taken to the George Washington University Hospital via ambulance where he underwent surgery for his injuries. He was in critical condition immediately following surgery. The day after the shooting, his condition was upgraded from critical to serious. On June 23, he was released from the hospital.\nDavid Bailey and Crystal Griner, two of the Capitol Police officers assigned to protect Scalise, were both injured. Griner was shot in the ankle and was hospitalized in what was described as good condition. Bailey was treated and released after sustaining a minor injury not caused by gunfire. Zack Barth, a legislative aide to Representative Roger Williams of Texas, was shot in the calf. He was treated at the hospital and released. Representative Williams, a former Minor League Baseball player and coach of the Republican team, sprained his ankle while jumping into a dugout during the attack to avoid being shot. He used a crutch for support for a few weeks after.\nPerpetrator.\nPolice identified the shooter as James Thomas Hodgkinson, 66 years old, whose last permanent residence was in Belleville, Illinois. He was politically active; according to a former attorney of his, he \"never did anything violent\". He was severely injured in the shootout and transported to the George Washington University Hospital, where he died from his injuries. The sheriff of St. Clair County, Illinois, said that deputies had been called to Hodgkinson's house about half a dozen times in the past 20 years. In 2006, Hodgkinson was accused of beating his foster daughter and charged with domestic battery, but the case was dismissed when the alleged victim decided not to testify. Had Hodgkinson been convicted, he would have been unable to legally purchase firearms.\nIn March 2017, a neighbor called police to complain about Hodgkinson firing a rifle at trees in their residential neighborhood. The officers who responded checked Hodgkinson's gun permit, then advised him not to shoot in the area but did not arrest him. Hodgkinson owned a home inspection business that had an expired license at the time of the shooting. Investigators believe that he had been living in a van in Alexandria for about six weeks at the time of the shooting. Witnesses say he often parked the van near the ball field and nearby YMCA, and was a frequent visitor to the YMCA. According to Tim Slater of the FBI's Washington, D.C., field office, Hodgkinson was \"running out of money. He was not employed at the time of the event, and he was looking for some local employment. He was married for 30 years, and it appears that that marriage was not going very well. It was just a pattern of life where you could tell things were not going well.\"\nMotives.\nHodgkinson had participated in the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign, and was described by a fellow campaigner in Iowa as a \"quiet guy, very mellow, very reserved\". Republican Congressman Mike Bost, who represents Hodgkinson's home district, said Hodgkinson had contacted his office ten times but \"never with any threats, only anger\". He wrote 27 letters to the editor of the \"Belleville News-Democrat\" between March 2008 and September 2012 on various political and economic topics, many of which were anti-Republican.\nOn May 22, 2017, Hodgkinson wrote \"Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump &amp; Co.\" above his repost of a Change.org petition demanding \"the legal removal\" of Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for \"treason\". He belonged to numerous political Facebook groups, including those named \"Terminate the Republican Party\", \"The Road To Hell Is Paved With Republicans\", and \"Donald Trump is not my President.\" The apparent influence of political pundits on social media gives this attack at least the appearance of Stochastic terrorism.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which took over the investigation, said on June 14 that it was too early to ascribe a motive for the shootings. It put out a request for public assistance with \"any information regarding Hodgkinson\". On June 16, \"USA Today\" reported, citing an anonymous source, that the FBI found a list of names, including those of Republican Congressmen Mo Brooks, Jeff Duncan and Trent Franks, in Hodgkinson's pocket. On June 21, FBI agent Timothy Slater said the names of six congressmen were written on a piece of paper found in an Alexandria storage locker rented to Hodgkinson. He said it did not appear to be a hit list, and that its significance was unclear.\nReactions.\nThe attack drew a bipartisan response as many politicians immediately sent out notes expressing their anger over the shooting, recovery wishes for the injured and gratitude for the police. News of the shooting and injuries quickly reached the Democratic Congressional Baseball players, who were at their own practice at another location when the shooting occurred. They gathered together in the dugout to pray for the injured.\nPresident Trump addressed the nation saying, \"We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected.\" He and his wife, Melania Trump, visited Scalise and Griner in the hospital. While at the hospital, the Trumps spoke with Scalise's family and with Griner and her wife. On July 27, 2017, Trump awarded the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to five of the officers who were injured in the shooting.\nSpeaker of the U.S. House Paul Ryan (R–WI) addressed the U.S. House of Representatives before their afternoon session and said, \"An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.\" Members of both parties rose in applause to his remarks. Former Representative Gabby Giffords (D–AZ), who survived the 2011 Tucson shooting, sent a tweet that read \"My heart is with my former colleagues, their families and staff, and the US Capitol Police—public servants and heroes today and every day.\"\nHours after the shooting, Senator Bernie Sanders responded on the U.S. Senate floor to news that Hodgkinson was a campaign volunteer for his 2016 U.S. presidential election run:\nReactions to the shooting among political activists were split. Some liberals, such as Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, called for stricter gun control laws, while some Republicans, such as Chris Collins, blamed anti-Trump rhetoric. Other activists blamed growing national political polarization, as reported by the Pew Research Center, for causing the shooting.\nIncreased ticket sales.\nCongressional leaders announced on the afternoon of June 14 that the Congressional Baseball Game, which is played for charity, would take place as scheduled the next day.\nThe annual game usually attracted a crowd of about 10,000 people, but after the shooting, more than 20,000 tickets were sold, bringing in more than $1 million for charity. David Bailey, one of the two Capitol Police officers injured in the shootout, threw out the first pitch. Relying on crutches because of his injury, he received a standing ovation from the crowd of 24,959 in Nationals Park. Many players of both parties wore Louisiana State University hats with their uniforms as a tribute to Scalise. While the Democratic team defeated the Republican team 11–2, they loaned the trophy to the Republicans until Scalise finished his recovery."

The tour was the first full scale trip to the British Isles attempted by the Australian national side since the First Wallaby tour of 1908 and the 1927/8 Waratah Tour (which has retrospectively been accorded national representative status).

The 32 national teams involved in the tournament were required to register a squad of 23 players, including three goalkeepers. Only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\nA provisional list of 35 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 14 May 2018, one month prior to the opening match of the tournament. From the preliminary squad, the final list of 23 players per national team was submitted to FIFA by 4 June, 10 days prior to the opening match of the tournament. FIFA published the final lists with squad numbers on their website the same day. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first match, where the replacement players did not need to be in the preliminary squad.\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.

He wrote about the painting: \"my main aim was to produce a picture that held a moment in time, but unlike a photograph, which only records an event. I thought a painting could give a more universal, deeper meaning to that moment by composing one instant from lots of different unrelated moments.\" Its original title was a line from Thomas Hardy's poem \"She, to Him\": \"Remembering mine the loss is, not the blame\".\nThe painting was exhibited at the ICA Summer Studio exhibition in London. It has been in the collection of the Tate since 1980. According to \"The Guardian\", it is \"one of the most enduringly popular images in the museum's collection\". As of 2017, it was not on display.\nIn 2011 \"The Badminton Game\" was the subject of an episode in the BBC series \"Hidden Paintings of the West\"."

Instead, each team's sum of points is divided by two (rounded up if number is odd).\nSo, IEK Xini DIKEAS began the play-offs with 21 points, while Diomidis Argous, ASE Douka and AEK all began with 16 points.\nFinals.\nIn the finals, teams playing against each other have to win three games to win the series. Thus, if one team wins three games before all five games have been played, the remaining games are omitted. The team that finished in the higher championship play-off place, is going to play the first, second and fifth (if necessary) game of the series at home."

        "text": "Clarence Edward Sutton is an author, entrepreneur, motivational speaker, and former NFL football player who played for the Appalachian State Mountaineers and the Chicago Bears. During his time with the Mountaineers, Sutton and his teammates became the first North Carolina Division 1 team to go undefeated. He is currently the founder and President of CTSHealth, a private agency that provides mental health, foster care, and adoption services to high-risk populations throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and Illinois. Sutton is also the author of \"Why Not Me – From Survival to Significance\", a biography that explores his early life growing up in inner city Chicago, and published his newest book, \"Is It Us?\", in January 2023, a memoir of spiritual enlightenment.\nEarly life.\nSutton was born on December 29, 1972, and grew up in Austin, Chicago, the largest suburb of Chicago by both size and population. According to the Chicago Police Department, the area is known to have high rates of poverty, homicide, and violent crime. While growing up, Sutton was frequently exposed to gang violence and criminal activity. However, he was able to find comfort and empowerment through athletics. He pursued football, baseball, and track at Austin Community Academy High School, and his success enabled him to leave Chicago to pursue a better future.\nFootball career.\nSutton first attended Triton College, a two-year community college, where he continued to play football. When the school's football program was eliminated, Sutton was recruited by several 4-year colleges, and ultimately selected Appalachian State University. At Appalachian, Sutton majored in Criminal Justice and played for the Appalachian State Mountaineers. \nIn 1996, Sutton was signed by the Chicago Bears as a free agent, where he played until 1997. While preparing to sign with the Kansas City Chiefs, he learned that he was at risk for long-term disabilities and nerve damage should he continue to play football. Sutton decided to walk away from the sport he loved and began to pursue other avenues.\nPost-Athletic career.\nAfter leaving his athletic career, Sutton worked for the Texas Juvenile Probation System in Beaumont, Texas, helping to guide and mentor at-risk children. In 1998, he and his family moved to Concord, North Carolina, where he enrolled in the local police academy. Upon graduation, Sutton became a law enforcement officer for the Concord City Police Department, and later a deputy sheriff for the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Department. While he enjoyed the work, he found that he missed working with children and young people.\nIn 1999, Sutton began working with the North Carolina State Medicaid program, where he learned the ins-and-outs of the mental health field. When North Carolina voted to divest itself from various public programs, Sutton decided to start his own private venture that would provide opportunities and resources to the state's underserved areas. In 2001, he founded Carolina Therapeutic Services, Inc. (CTS), formerly Greater Metrolina Mental Health Services. This private agency provides mental health services, foster care, and adoption to high-risk populations in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Illinois.\nIn 2014, Sutton formed CTS Community Development, a 501(c)3 non-profit that provides funding for school supplies, scholarships, holiday gifts, and more to low-income adults and children.\nWorks.\nIn January 2023, Sutton published a second book, \"Is It Us?\" Having overcome the challenges of growing up on west side Chicago Clarence had fulfilled his dreams of becoming a professional football player, police officer, and businessman by his early thirties. He was surrounded by family and his business thrived across many states. He embraced all the trappings of success, new cars, travel, free to be whoever he wanted to be. When it all fell apart, Clarence disappeared. Follow his journey back from despair in this moving, authentic story of redemption.\nSutton published his first biography, \"Why Not Me – From Survival to Significance\", in 2017. The book explores Sutton's early life in Chicago and his struggles to overcome the obstacles of inner city life and was written to be a source of strength, encouragement, and inspiration to young people facing similar challenges. Proceeds from the book's sales go to benefit various CTS Community Development programs."

The group consisted of three countries: Australia, England, Fiji and South Africa.\nAustralia vs South Africa.\nThe Kangaroos scored a World Cup and international league record 16 tries against minnows South Africa. Australian halfback Andrew Johns kicked 11 goals (from 16 attempts) to break the record for most goals kicked in a rugby league test. Gideon Watts scored the Rhinos only try of the tournament. With the selection of Cronulla hooker Aaron Raper, he became Australia's first second generation World Cup player following the footsteps of his famous father Johnny Raper who captained Australia to World Cup success in 1968. Australian coach Bob Fulton had been a team mate of Raper's father in the 1968 Rugby League World Cup final win over France.\nEngland vs Fiji.\nEngland captain Shaun Edwards was on the bench and remained there for the entire game amid rumours of a knee injury. The rumours turned out to be true and Edwards did not play again in the tournament. The captaincy was then handed to former Wigan team mate Denis Betts making history by becoming the first player chosen to captain England while not playing in the English premiership. Betts at the time was playing for the Auckland Warriors in the Australian Rugby League competition.\nEngland vs South Africa.\nEngland went into the match already having booked a Semi-final berth. For South Africa, the Rhinos had pride on the line and the want to not have England put a big score on them. The Rhinos earned the respect of their opponents and the 14,041 crowd at Headingley with a willing display."

The tournament featured the six teams that played in the previous season. The 2017 season was reported to be played from 18 to 28 July 2017, but took place in September 2017, with the Kabul International Cricket Ground hosting all the matches.\nThe player auction took place in May 2017. Overseas players sold during the auction included Umar Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Kamran Akmal, Rumman Raees, Sohail Khan, Mohammad Nawaz and Mohammad Rizwan (Pakistan), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes and Sabbir Rahman (Bangladesh), Sikandar Raza, Solomon Mire, Sean Williams and Hamilton Masakadza (Zimbabwe) and Rayad Emrit (West Indies). However, following a breakdown in relations between the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the PCB banned its players from taking part. The Bangladesh players also withdrew. As a result of this, and the tournament moving from July to September, overseas players were redrafted. Shortly before the tournament, Sean Williams decided not to travel to join up with Spin Ghar Tigers in order to work on his fitness.\nOn 13 September 2017, during the match between Boost Defenders and Mis Ainak Knights, a suicide bomber detonated explosives at a checkpoint near the road leading to the stadium, killing three people. The match was briefly halted, but soon resumed. Following the blast, the South African and Zimbabwean cricket boards ordered their representatives to return home. However, most of the Zimbabwean players opted to remain and continue with the tournament, as did the majority of other overseas players, coaches, and commentators such as Dean Jones who expressed his solidarity with the people of Afghanistan. This was the first edition of the tournament since the ICC granted it official Twenty20 status (originally it was given List A cricket status before the 50-over Ghazi Amanullah Khan Regional One Day Tournament was also recognised).\nTeams auction.\nFor the first time in the history of the tournament, since its introduction in 2013 edition of Shpageeza Cricket League, the six teams are now franchise based team and are sold/owned for 3 years, by the winning bid franchises.\nSquads.\nAfter the squads were announced, Band-e-Amir Dragons added Tendai Chatara (Zimbabwe) and Ashan Priyanjan (Sri Lanka), while Boost Defenders added Abdul Razak (South Africa) and Johnathan Campbell (Zimbabwe) to their squads as overseas players."

        "text": "The 2018 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 102nd Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil for sponsorship reasons) was a Verizon IndyCar Series held on Sunday, May 27, 2018, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana. It was the premier event of the 2018 IndyCar Series. The race was won by Australian Will Power of Team Penske. Car owner Roger Penske collected his record extending 17th Indianapolis 500 victory. Chevrolet swept nine of the top eleven spots during qualifying, and finished 1st-2nd, Chevy's first Indy victory since 2015, and tenth overall. However, despite entering the month as prohibitive favorites to dominate the race, Chevy managed to place only two other cars in the top ten.\nMuch of the race was led by Will Power and Ed Carpenter, a race that was considered generally less-competitive that the previous few years, attributed largely to a newly-introduced aero kit package. Late in the race, pit strategy and a timely caution flag factored in. On a restart on lap 194, Oriol Servià, Stefan Wilson, and Jack Harvey were all attempting to stretch their fuel to the finish, gambling on a late caution, and a possible surprise victory. However, with four laps to go, both Wilson and Harvey were forced to pit for fuel, as was Servià a lap later. Will Power took the lead and cruised to victory, having led 59 laps. Polesitter Ed Carpenter led 65 laps and finished second, his best-career Indy finish. 2016 winner Alexander Rossi had an outstanding charge from 32nd to 4th, leading one lap during the race. Power became the first driver to win both the IndyCar Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500, as well as the first driver to sweep both races in the same year. Later in the year, Team Penske also won the NASCAR Brickyard 400, becoming the second team in history to sweep both the Indy 500 and Brickyard 400 in the same year.\nThe month of May activities formally began on May 12 with the fifth running of the IndyCar Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice for the Indianapolis 500 began on Tuesday May 15, and time trials was held May 19–20. Ed Carpenter won the pole position, his third career Indy pole. Carb Day—the traditional final day of practice, as well as the annual Pit Stop Challenge and Indy Lights Freedom 100, were held Friday May 25.\nRace background.\nIR18 car.\nThe 2017 race was the third and final year contested with the Chevrolet and Honda aero kits outfitted to the Dallara DW12 chassis. Beginning in 2018, all DW12 Safety Cell chassis were fitted with a universal bodywork kit. Digital renderings for the common bodywork kit, referred to as the 'IR18' car, were released in early May 2017. The car was officially unveiled in late July, and the universal aero kit became known as the UAK18 bodywork. The bodywork is inspired by CART's 1990s and 2000s livery. For the first time since 1996, the cars in the Indy 500 had a roll hoop without an airbox.\n2018 IndyCar Series.\nThe 102nd Indianapolis 500 was the sixth race of the 2018 Verizon IndyCar Series season, and 23rd sanctioned as part of the Indy Racing League/IndyCar Series. There were four different winners in the first five races of the season. For the second year in a row, Sébastien Bourdais won the season opener at St. Petersburg. Once again, Bourdais won in surprising fashion, taking the lead after the leaders collided on a late-race restart. It was also Bourdais' first victory since suffering injuries in a crash during qualifying for the 2017 Indy 500. Josef Newgarden won at Phoenix, Alexander Rossi won at Long Beach, and Newgarden won again at Birmingham. To begin the month of May, Will Power won the IndyCar Grand Prix, his third win in the event.\nOffseason changes included Chip Ganassi Racing, which dropped down to two cars only (Scott Dixon and Ed Jones). Team Penske also dropped down from four full-time cars to three. Hélio Castroneves switched to the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, and raced at Indianapolis only. Two-time Indy 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya, however, was left out of a ride for the 2018 race.\nSchedule.\nFour days of testing were scheduled at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway prior to the official opening of the track. On March 23, manufacturer testing was conducted on the road course for Honda. Testing on the oval was scheduled for March 27–29, but was postponed due to inclement weather in the forecast. A full-field, league-sponsored open test was held on the oval April 30, followed by the Rookie Orientation Program and Refresher tests on May 1. On May 2, track activity continued with a private manufacturers test involving both Honda and Chevrolet.\nTesting and rookie orientation.\nTesting — July 2017.\nOn July 25, 2017 the first official test for the universal bodywork kit was conducted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval. Two teams, one each representing Chevrolet and Honda, attended. Team Penske with driver Juan Pablo Montoya tested for Chevy, and Schmidt Peterson Motorsports with driver Oriol Servià tested for Honda. The tests were considered successful, and no incidents were reported.\nTesting — October 2017.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2017 IndyCar Series season, each manufacturer was allocated five days of aero kit testing through December 17. The league stipulated one test for each manufacturer, leaving four dates to the manufacturer's discretion. Honda elected to use one of their four dates at Indianapolis on October 26. James Hinchcliffe (Schmidt Peterson) and Scott Dixon (Ganassi) each completed more than 130 laps without incident. Cool temperatures delayed the start of the test until the afternoon, and testing concluded at 6 p.m. Speeds were not reported.\nTime trials.\nBump Day — Saturday, May 19.\nBump Day was held on May 19. The 33 cars that would comprise the starting lineup would be determined, as well as the nine cars eligible for the \"Fast 9\" shoot-out to be held on Sunday to determine pole position. Two periods of rain caused delays during the course of the day, but all 35 entries were able to make attempts.\nHélio Castroneves set the fastest speed of the day with a four-lap average of 228.919 mph, besting Ed Carpenter and Simon Pagenaud. Completing the Fast Nine were Will Power, Sébastien Bourdais, Spencer Pigot, Josef Newgarden, Scott Dixon, and Danica Patrick.\nAt the opposite end of the field, several entries struggled to find the speed necessary to make the starting lineup. The three cars of Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing (Takuma Sato, Graham Rahal, and Oriol Servià in particular) all had difficulties, but all three held on to make the field. Servià made three attempts, and finally made the field safely with about 35 minutes left in the day. Other drivers facing difficulty included Conor Daly and Pippa Mann. Daly would make the field, but despite being the last qualifier of the day, Mann failed to qualify.\nThe most shocking story of day, however, was 2016 pole sitter, and three-time front row starter, James Hinchcliffe, who was bumped from the field. Hinchcliffe's first qualifying attempt came after the first rain delay, with less than ideal chassis setups. Hinchcliffe steadily slipped down the standings, and was bumped from the field in the final half hour. The team quickly got the car into the qualifying line, and Hinchcliffe pulled away for his second attempt with less than fifteen minutes left in the day. On his warm-up lap, he detected a bad vibration, and had to abort the run and return to the pits. A tire pressure sensor inside one of the wheels had come loose, and was ricocheting inside the tire. The crew desperately scrambled to diagnose the problem, change tires, and get back into the qualifying line. However, the gun went off at 5:50 p.m. to close qualifying, with Hinchcliffe still waiting in line.\nAfter his crash during practice on Friday, and after his crew worked late into the night to make repairs, James Davison ended the day on the bubble. Davison posted the 33rd-fastest speed Saturday, and held on to make the field.\nPole Day — Sunday, May 20.\nPositions 10-33.\nSunny skies meant no interruptions to qualifying during Sunday qualifications. The opening session determined positions 10-33 on the starting grid, with drivers taking to the track in reverse order of their ranking from their Bump Day runs. Tony Kanaan went fastest in the group, besting his teammate Matheus Leist, who ended the day as the fastest rookie qualifier. Several favorites struggled to find speed during the day, including 2016 winner Alexander Rossi, who slipped to 32nd after fighting an ill-handling car during his run. \nBig gainers for the day included James Davison, who improved from 33rd on Saturday to 19th on Sunday. Defending race winner Takuma Sato also went from 29th on Saturday to 16th on Sunday. Sato's teammate Graham Rahal, however, ended the day in the same position as the day before (30th).\nFirestone Fast Nine.\n\"Fast Nine\" qualifications began at 5:00 p.m., with drivers who qualified in the top nine the previous day taking to the track in reverse order in their bid to win pole position. For the third time in his career, Ed Carpenter secured pole position for the race, posting a four-lap average at 229.618 mph. Team Penske teammates Simon Pagenaud and Will Power completed the front row. Danica Patrick placed 7th in her return qualification at the course.\nPost-qualifying practice.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe Pit Stop Challenge was held on Friday May 25. Because of rules that qualification included pit stop performance during the season, James Hinchcliffe of Schmidt Peterson Motorsports was part of the event although he did not qualify for the race. Schmidt Peterson Motorsports had three entries for the Indianapolis 500, with two full-time teams (No. 5 and No. 6) and a third team for the Indianapolis 500 only, the No. 7 team. After the No. 5 failed to qualify, the team subsequently assigned the No. 5 pit crew to pit the No. 7 driven by Jay Howard for the race, and advanced all the way to the finals. Hinchcliffe battled Scott Dixon of Chip Ganassi Racing in a best-of-three finals, with Dixon's team taking the victory. \n\"NOTE: Since the No. 5 Schmidt Peterson Motorsports car failed to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 race, the pit crew was assigned to the No. 7 car for the race. The crew was registered by the Speedway as the No. 7 crew as it would be that team during the race, even though it used its regular driver during the competition.\"\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify\nRace.\nFirst half.\nWith temperatures flirting with the race day record of , drivers and teams were forced to figure out how the new aero kits would react to extreme heat. The race began with Ed Carpenter pulling ahead of the field, with Will Power jumping up into second place ahead of Simon Pagenaud. Further back, Tony Kanaan managed an excellent start, jumping up to sixth position from his tenth place starting spot. One lap later, Pagenaud moved back into second place. From there, the field began to spread out; the new aero kit and high heat removed much of the slingshot drafting that defined the last several 500s, thus allowing Carpenter to pull out a roughly two second advantage by the time the first pit stops came. The opening round of stops came around lap 30, with Carpenter maintaining his lead, but Kanaan and Josef Newgarden jumped up to second and third respectively after slightly earlier stops gave the duo an advantage of fresher tires for a few laps. Pagenaud, Hélio Castroneves, and Power rounded up the top six after the first stops were done. \nThe first caution period of the race came at lap 47 when Takuma Sato came up on backmarker James Davison. Davison, who had been running significantly slower than the rest of the field for several laps, tried to remain high through turn 3 to keep out of the way, but with such speed differential, Sato was unable to avoid Davison's car and collided with Davison's left-rear wheel. Davison's car spun around and continued sliding until it impacted the turn 4 wall, while Sato was able to guide his car to rest in the grass on the inside of turn 4. During the caution, most of the field pitted with Carpenter, Kanaan, and Power emerging first from pit lane. The lead moved to Zachary Claman DeMelo, who elected not to pit during the caution. \nRacing resumed at lap 56, with Carpenter and Kanaan passing DeMelo almost as soon as the green flag waved. The green flag period was short lived, though, as, on lap 58, Ed Jones lost control of his car in turn 2, spun around, and impacted the outside wall. Jones emerged from the car under his own power, but was later transported to hospital after complaining of head and neck pain. As the caution flew again, the running order was Carpenter, Kanaan, Newgarden, Pagenaud, DeMelo, Power.\nRacing once again resumed at lap 64, with Kanaan getting the jump on Carpenter and taking the lead into turn 1. The next lap, the lead switched back, as Carpenter made his way back around Kanaan into turn one to resume first place. Once again, the green flag stint proved to be short; on lap 68, Danica Patrick lost control of her car in turn 2 in similar fashion to Jones, spinning around and impacting the outside wall before sliding back across the track and impacting the inside wall. Patrick's final 500 resulted in a lowly 30th-place finish. Few drivers elected to pit during the caution, with Newgarden, DeMelo, and Robert Wickens the only major takers. \nThe next restart came on lap 73, with Kanaan once again passing Carpenter for the lead heading into turn 1, while Power moved into third place after passing Pagenaud. This running order remained unchanged until pit stops came again around lap 90. During the sequence, Power jumped both Kanaan and Carpenter and moved into the lead when cars running out-of-sequence on pit strategy all pitted by lap 106. On lap 99, Kanaan's chances of picking up a second Indy victory were dashed when he picked up a puncture, forcing him back to the pit lane and placing him one lap down.\nSecond half.\nShortly after halfway, rookie Kyle Kaiser dropped out of the race with mechanical issues, the only rookie to retire from the race. Up front, Power held a commanding 4.7 second lead of Carpenter, but the gap would close back down to just over a second when Stefan Wilson managed to un-lap himself on lap 121. By lap 127, pit stops once again came, with Power maintaining his place ahead of Carpenter. On lap 138, the fourth caution period of the day came, when Sébastien Bourdais lost control of his car coming off of turn 3 while running close behind Alexander Rossi. Bourdais attempted to save his car in the north short-chute, but spun around completely and impacted the turn 4 wall. With the field bunched back up again and drivers off-sequence pitting during the yellow, the running order ran Power, Carpenter, Pagenaud, Ryan Hunter-Reay, and Castroneves. \nThe restart came at lap 145, with Power quickly pulling away. Green flag conditions lasted for less than a lap, as coming off of turn 4, Castroneves spun, slid across the track and impacted the inside wall before sliding to a halt on the pit lane. The caution simplified pit stop strategy for most, as it ensured that only one more stop would be necessary during the race.\nRacing once again resumed on lap 154 with Power once again opening up his lead. Further back, Rossi, who had started the race from the back row, made his way into the lead group with a daring outside pass through turn 1 and 2 to move him into third ahead of Pagenaud and Hunter-Reay. Caution flew just as quickly as the previous run, though, this time for Sage Karam losing control of his car at the exit of turn 4 and making contact with the outside wall, which ripped the right-rear tire off of Karam's car. During the caution, the front-runners stayed out, while a few drivers, including Oriol Servià, Stefan Wilson, Jack Harvey, and Scott Dixon pitted, hoping to get more caution in the remaining laps to move their way to the top of the field. \nRacing resumed again at lap 162, with Power once again opening his lead over Carpenter. The running order for front runners remained largely the same until pit stops between lap 170 and 175. Power retained his advantage over Carpenter, but now six off-sequence cars were ahead of him, with Servià leading the way over Wilson, Harvey and Dixon. By lap 185, Power had managed to move back up into fourth, but on lap 188, the caution that the off-sequence drivers needed finally appeared when Tony Kanaan lost control of his car coming off of turn 2 and impacted the outside wall.\nFinish.\nThe track went green on lap 194. Race leader Servià was immediately being passed by both Wilson and Harvey; both drivers were critical on fuel, and were gambling on a late caution to conserve enough fuel for victory. Power moved into third on the next lap and began setting his sights on the other two ahead. Power was suddenly promoted to first with only four laps left when both Wilson and Harvey dived into pit lane for fuel. The next lap, Servià pitted from second, leaving Power with an over 2 second advantage over Carpenter. With a large lead, Power was able to cruise to victory, securing his first victory at the race and becoming the first Australian to take victory in the 500. It was also Roger Penske's 17th Indy 500 victory as a car owner. For his victory, Power took away $2.52 million.

NBC Sports announced in March 2018 that it had acquired the broadcast television rights to the IndyCar Series beginning in 2019 under a three-year deal (complementing the current cable rightsholder NBCSN), with a package of races on NBC (including the 500) replacing the existing package of races on ABC. It ended a relationship between the race and ABC dating back to 1965.\nIn the United States, the 2018 Indianapolis 500 was the least-watched edition of the race since the inception of live flag-to-flag coverage, with a 3.4 overnight rating (in comparison to the 3.6 rating it received in 2017).\nCarb Day, the final practice session, along with the Pit Stop Challenge and Freedom 100, were carried on NBCSN. The booth announcers for NBCSN were Kevin Lee, Townsend Bell and Paul Tracy. The pit reporters were Marty Snider, Jon Beekhuis, Katie Hargitt, and Robin Miller. Lee was joined in the booth by Anders Krohn and Kyle Kaiser for the Freedom 100 coverage.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Mark Jaynes served as the chief announcer for the third year. New to the broadcast was driver analyst Anders Krohn, and pit reporter Ryan Myrehn. As had been in three previous years (2010, 2012-13) the turn one position was vacated. It was decided that the chief announcer in the Pagoda had a clear view of turn one, and a separate reporter was not necessary. Jerry Baker, who had been stationed in turn one dating back to 1986, was absent from the crew entirely, and did not take a substitute booth role as he did in 2010, 2012 and 2013. It was the first time Baker was not part of the crew in any on-air role since his first year in 1974.\n1070 The Fan broadcast nightly beginning May 7 with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\"."

All conference members qualify for the championship meet, which is held in three rounds. The tournament began in 1981 and is rotated between the home arenas of the seven conference members. Through the 2021 championship, Central Michigan has won the most championships with 16, followed by Kent State with 12.\nHistory and format.\nThe championship was organized in 1981 after the Mid-American Conference added women's gymnastics as a sponsored sport. The NCAA began sponsoring women's gymnastics as a sport in 1981 and held the first championship tournament in 1982. Prior to 1981, most MAC member schools had women's gymnastics teams who competed in the Division for Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS), which staged its first national championship in 1968. The DGWS later became the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) in 1973. Teams also participated in regional and state-level championship meets, such as the Ohio Association of Intercollegiate Sports for Women and the Midwest Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Many of the programs were founded in the mid-1970s as a result of Title IX, though some programs originated earlier as clubs, such as Kent State in 1959.\nThe first MAC championship meet was hosted by Kent State University on March 21, 1981, in the Gymnastics Center at Memorial Gym and included the seven current members of the conference who sponsor women's gymnastics. Initially, eight conference members sponsored women's gymnastics, though Miami University was only able to participate in the 1982 championship meet and dropped the sport after the 1982–83 season. Northern Illinois University left the conference in 1986, reducing conference women's gymnastics membership to six teams, which stood until NIU returned to the conference for the 1997–98 season. The championship is rotated every year to the home arenas of the different member schools, so each school hosts every eighth year under the current format. At the meet, each team competes in four rotations: balance beam, uneven bars, vault, and floor exercise. In addition to the team champions, the conference recognizes an all-around winner and individual winners for each rotation. The team champion is awarded a regional berth in the NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships. \nBy year.\nThe following is a list of conference champions, individual all-around winners, and championship locations listed by year.\nBy school.\nThe following table lists all teams that have been part of the championship, the years they have participated, and the years the respective program has won the team championship.\n &lt;br&gt;"

His best result came at the 1979 New South Wales Open, where he and Steve Docherty were runners-up in the doubles event, to Peter McNamara and Paul McNamee.\nAt the 1980 French Open he was a semi-finalist in the mixed doubles, with Leslie Allen. The pair hadn't dropped a set until they lost their semi-final in three sets to Czechoslovakians Stanislav Birner and Renáta Tomanová. He also competed in the men's doubles draw with USC teammate Glenn Petrovic. His only other Grand Slam appearance came in the mixed doubles at the 1980 Wimbledon Championships, where he exited in the second round without playing a single point. Again partnering Allen, the pair received a bye in the first round, then withdrew from their scheduled second round match against Colin Dowdeswell and Greer Stevens.\nBusiness.\nLewis co-found a private equity firm in 1982 with Richard Riordan, who was later Mayor of Los Angeles . Former NFL quarterback Pat Haden joined the firm in 1987 and it has since been named Riordan, Lewis &amp; Haden."

        "text": "Brittany Howard (born November 20, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player for PWHL Toronto of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL). She played college ice hockey at Robert Morris and was the first Colonial player to win the CHA Player of the Year award.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nHoward attended Parkside Collegiate Institute in her hometown of St. Thomas, Ontario, where she was named MVP of her basketball team, received the Award of Excellence, and was a three-time honor student. Howard played four seasons of junior hockey in London, Ontario with the London Devilettes of the Provincial Women's Hockey League. On October 21, 2012, Howard scored seven points to tie the league single-game record in a 7–3 win against the Kitchener-Waterloo Rangers. Howard was an alternate captain and led the Devilettes in scoring in her final season. Along with other Devilettes Jessica Dodds and Tia Kipfer, Howard earned a place at Robert Morris in 2013, joining former Devilettes Anneline Lauziere and Erin Staniewski. All eleven graduating players from the Devilettes 2012–13 squad would move on to play for NCAA or CIS schools.\nNCAA.\nHoward first played for Robert Morris University in the 2013–14 season. During the 2013–14 season, she made an immediate impact, being named the CHA Player of the month in her first month of play. The addition of Howard was credited with improving the tenth-ranked team's overall offense and making it harder to defend. That season, she led all rookies in the country in assists and points (17G, 24A, 41P). She was named to the USCHO All-Rookie Team (national), the CHA All-Rookie Team and the CHA All-Star Second Team.\nHoward played only two games in 2014–15 due to a knee injury. The injury gives her an extra year of NCAA eligibility. The team missed her point total of 41 in 2013–14 which led the team, while in 2014–15 the team leader had 21 points. Howard returned in September 2015 to bolster their offence. In the 2015–16 season, she was a CHA First Team All-Star, leading the conference in points (40). She finished the season being named ASN Women's Player of the Week after back-to-back three-point games and led the team in goals and points.\nThe 2016–17 season was Howard's best year to date, as she was named the CHA Player of the Year, with multiple Player of the month accolades, on the strength of 20 goals and 30 assists. Her 50 points were the tenth best in the nation, as she was the offensive leader during Robert Morris' first season in which they won the CHA conference championship and played in the NCAA Tournament. Number 8-ranked RMU would lose in the first round to the no. 1-ranked University of Wisconsin. During the season, Howard surpassed Rebecca Vint as the all-time leading scorer for the RMU program.\nThe NWHL named Howard the top available prospect in the nation. As she committed to completing her senior year at Robert Morris, she was drafted 10th overall by the Buffalo Beauts, the first CHA Conference member to be drafted by the league. \nHoward, Jaycee Gebhard and Amber Rennie contributed 42% of RMU's points in 2016-17. With all three returning the next season, Robert Morris was favored to win the CHA again in 2017–18. The Colonials had another strong year, winning the regular season championship. They played Mercyhurst in the CHA championship game, losing by a score of 3-5. Playing as a red-shirt senior, Howard finished the year with 49 point on 25 goals and 24 assists.\nProfessional.\nHoward was drafted in the third round of the 2017 NWHL Draft by the Buffalo Beauts after being named the top prospect in the nation. Rather than sign with the Beauts, she chose to join the Toronto Furies of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) and went on to spend three seasons with the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) following the collapse of the CWHL in 2019. She joined the Toronto Six of the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) for the 2022-23 season, being named an all-star and leading the team in scoring as the Six would go on to win the Isobel Cup.\nShe was drafted in the eighth round of the 2023 PWHL Draft by Toronto.\nCareer statistics.\nNCAA.\nSource: USCHO."

However, in the midst of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus were suspended from competing in all IIHF tournaments for at least a year. This marked the first time that Russia missed the top division of the World Championship since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For this tournament, the suspended nations were replaced by Austria and France, the two highest-ranked teams in 2021 that had not already qualified. Additionally, the venue in Helsinki was moved from Helsinki Halli, previously known as Hartwall Arena, to Helsinki Ice Hall due to the former being owned by Russian oligarchs.\nFinland defeated Canada 4–3 in overtime in the gold medal game for their fourth title and their first medal ever won on home ice. This marked the first time since the introduction of the playoff round in 1992 that the same two teams met in the gold medal game three tournaments in a row. Czechia won the bronze medal, their first medal since 2012, after an 8–4 win over the United States.\nThe tournament saw multiple historic upsets: Austria's first victory against Czechia, and Denmark's first victory against Canada.

        "title": "2021 IIHF World Championship",
        "text": "The 2021 IIHF World Championship () took place from 21 May to 6 June 2021. It was originally to be co-hosted by Minsk, Belarus and Riga, Latvia, as the IIHF announced on 19 May 2017 in Cologne, Germany. Their joint bid won by a very tight margin against the Finnish bid with the cities of Tampere and Helsinki. On 18 January 2021 the IIHF decided to remove Belarus as a co-host due to the rising political unrest and COVID-19 concerns there. On 2 February, the IIHF voted to confirm Latvia as the sole host for the 2021 IIHF World Championship.\nThis tournament was notable for the number of upsets that occurred in the preliminary round, including Denmark and Belarus' victories over Sweden, Kazakhstan's victory over Finland, Slovakia's victory over Russia, and Latvia's victory over Canada. Sweden did not qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time since the current format has been introduced. On the other hand, Kazakhstan recorded their best World Championship result to date, finishing tenth, while only narrowly missing their first-ever play-off appearance.\nCanada won their 27th title, after defeating Finland in the final in overtime. Canada was the first team in history to win gold despite losing four times during the tournament. The United States won the bronze medal game, defeating Germany 6–1.\nVenues.\nThe Minsk Arena was originally planned to be used for the Championship.\nCOVID-19 restrictions.\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic protocols, the tournament was initially held behind closed doors with no spectators. Prior to the beginning of the tournament, and against objections by Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš and Minister of Health Daniels Pavļuts, the Latvian parliament voted in favour of a notion ordering the government to develop a plan for allowing spectators who are either fully vaccinated or otherwise immune due to recent infection.\nSpectators were admitted beginning June 1, and were to present electronic verification that they have either been fully vaccinated no fewer than 14 days prior with the Janssen, Moderna, or Pfizer vaccine, been fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, have received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine between 22 and 90 days prior, or have recently recovered from COVID-19. Arēna Rīga was capped at 2,660 spectators, and the Olympic Sports Centre at 1,058. Face masks were mandatory.\nBelarus hosting controversy.\nDespite similar political opposition in 2014 when Belarus was the sole host of the IIHF World Championship, Belarus was to be the co-host for the 2021 Championship. However, in the wake of the ongoing 2020–2021 Belarusian protests, several political groups, politicians and international entities, including the European Parliament and Krišjānis Kariņš, the Prime Minister of Latvia, which was set to co-host the championship, protested tournament matches being held in Belarus, and called for the country to be stripped of co-hosting duties. Several sponsors of the tournament reportedly threatened to withdraw from sponsoring the event if it took place in Belarus.\nOn January 18, 2021, the IIHF, citing \"safety and security issues,\" decided that the World Championship would not be played in Belarus. Latvia would remain as a co-host for the time being, but the IIHF was considering whether to go with another site, due to COVID-19 constraints and the desirability for single-site travel. Both Denmark and Slovakia (the tournament hosts in 2018 and 2019, respectively) reportedly offered to step in as hosts. An offer from Lithuania was declined by both the IIHF and the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation.\nBelarus flag controversy.\nOn May 24, 2021, following the Ryanair Flight 4978 incident, Latvian officials replaced the Belarusian state flag in Riga with the former flag faced with the former coat of arms used by opposition groups, including at the 2021 IIHF World Championship display of flags, which was replaced by Mayor of Riga Mārtiņš Staķis and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs. As a result, Belarus expelled the entire Latvian embassy from their country. The IIHF issued a statement protesting the replacement of the flag, and IIHF president René Fasel asked Riga's mayor to remove the IIHF name, flag and symbols from such sites, or to restore the flag, insisting that the IIHF is an \"apolitical sports organization\". In response, Staķis said he would remove the IIHF flags. On May 28, 2021, Belarus opened a criminal case against Staķis and Rinkēvičs, accusing them of fuelling \"national enmity\".\nParticipants.\nQualified as host\nAutomatic qualifier after the cancellation of the 2020 IIHF World Championship\n1 Pursuant to a December 2020 ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on doping sanctions, Russian athletes and teams are prohibited from competing under the Russian flag or using the Russian national anthem at any Olympic Games or world championships through 16 December 2022, and must compete as \"neutral athlete[s].\" For IIHF tournaments, the Russian team will play under the name \"Russian Olympic Committee\" (ROC). Instead of the Russian national anthem being played at the 2021 World Championship, Piano Concerto No. 1 by Pyotr Illych Tchaikovsky was played.\nSeeding.\nThe seedings in the preliminary round are based on the 2020 IIHF World Ranking, as of the end of the 2019 IIHF World Championship, using the serpentine system with a swap between Canada and ROC to \"accommodate special organizational needs\".\nGroup A\nGroup B\nRosters.\nEach team's roster consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 25 skaters and 3 goaltenders. All 16 participating nations, through the confirmation of their respective national associations, had to submit a \"Long List\" no later than two weeks before the tournament, and a final roster by the Passport Control meeting prior to the start of the tournament.\nMatch officials.\nEighteen referees and linesmen were announced on 7 April 2021.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot of the tournament was revealed in February 2020 by the IIHF. His name is Spiky the Hedgehog and he was voted by the fans in Belarus and Latvia. The hedgehog is a very popular animal in the hosting countries and it represents the fighting spirit and determination of the Belarus and Latvian national hockey teams.\nPreliminary round.\nThe groups were announced on 20 May 2020. The schedule was released on 5 February 2021.\nPlayoff round.\nPairings.\nQuarter-finalists were paired according to their positions in the groups: the first-place team in each preliminary-round group played the fourth-place team of the other group, while the second-place team played the third-place team of the other group.\nSemi-finalists are paired according to their seeding after the preliminary round, which is determined by the following criteria: 1)position in the group; 2)number of points; 3)goal difference; 4)number of goals scored for; 5)seeding number entering the tournament. The best-ranked semi-finalist plays against the lowest-ranked semi-finalist, while the second-best-ranked semi-finalist plays the third-best-ranked semi-finalist.\nFinal standings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nStatistics.\nScoring leaders.\nList shows the top skaters sorted by points, then goals.\nGoaltending leaders.\nOnly the top five goaltenders, based on save percentage, who have played at least 40% of their team's minutes, are included in this list.\nAwards.\nThe awards were announced on 6 June 2021.\nBroadcasting rights.\nThese are the broadcasters for the tournament."

In the meantime, World Rugby also received complaints amid European countries fielding ineligible players, in breach of Regulation 8, during the qualification process; issues were made against all competing five nations.\nThe appeal from Spain for their match to be replayed was held whilst the appointed panel investigated the accused ineligible players, although the final verdict around the Belgium–Spain was for the result to stand.\nThe neutral panel cleared Germany and Russia of the alleged ineligible players, but found Belgium, Romania and Spain guilty of breaching Regulation 8. The panel determined that each nation would be deducted 5 points for each game they had fielded an ineligible player, regardless of if more than one ineligible player had been fielded. The investigation found that Belgium and Romania had fielded ineligible players 6 times (a deduction of 30 points) and Spain 8 times (a deduction of 40 points) during the qualification process. This meant, with the deducted points for the respective nations, Russia would qualify ahead of Romania and Germany would advance to the play-off's ahead of Spain. "

        "text": "The 2017–18 Munster Rugby season was Munster's seventeenth season competing in the Pro14, alongside which they also competed in the European Rugby Champions Cup. It was Rassie Erasmus's second season as director of rugby and Johann van Graan's first as head coach.\nEvents.\nIn June 2017, after many weeks of media speculation, Munster confirmed that director of rugby Rassie Erasmus and Defence Coach Jacques Nienaber would leave their roles with the province and return to South Africa on 31 December 2017. In the same month however, coaches Jerry Flannery and Felix Jones extended their contracts with the province by two years, both expanding their roles to forwards coach and backline and attack coach respectively. Team manager Niall O'Donovan also signed a new three-year contract. \nIn the provinces only pre-season fixture, Munster beat English side Worcester Warriors 35–26 in Sixways Stadium on 24 August. The match saw former Munster stalwarts Peter Stringer and Donncha O'Callaghan play against their old club, while new signings Chris Farrell, Gerbrandt Grobler and James Hart made their non-competitive debuts for Munster. Munster began their 2017–18 Pro14 campaign on 1 September 2017, scoring six tries on their way to a comfortable 34–3 win against Benetton. In October 2017, Munster confirmed that then-South Africa Forwards Coach Johann van Graan would join the province in November as their new head coach. In the same month, it was announced that Munster's all-time leading try scorer, Simon Zebo, would leave the province at the end of the season.\nIn Rounds 1 &amp; 2 of the 2017–18 European Rugby Champions Cup in October 2017, Munster drew 17–17 away to Castres before earning a 14–7 win at home to Racing 92.

Johann van Graan's first official game as Munster's new head coach was a 36–19 win away against Zebre in the Pro14 on 26 November 2017. Defence Coach JP Ferreira joined Munster in December 2017. In the December Champions Cup double-header against Leicester Tigers, Munster won 33–10 at home before winning 25–16 away, their first win at Welford Road for 11 years. In doing so, Munster became the first team to defeat Leicester in both games of the double-header since they were introduced in 1999, while the home victory also saw Munster surpass 4,000 points in the competition. In Rounds 5 &amp; 6 of the Champions Cup, Munster lost 34–30 away to Racing 92 before beating Castres 48–3 at home, securing a record 17th quarter-final.

        "text": "The Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur men's basketball team, commonly known as ÍR, is the men's basketball department of Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur. It is based in Reykjavík, Iceland and was one of the pioneers of basketball in Iceland and one of the founding members of the men's Úrvalsdeild. From 1954 to 1977, the team won fifteen national championships. In 1964, it became the first Icelandic team to compete in a continental competition when it defeated the Collegians from Belfast, 71-17, in the first round of the 1964–65 FIBA European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague).\nHistory.\nÍR's men's basketball department was founded in 1949 and its first chairman was Finnbjörn Þorvaldsson. From 1960 to 1965 the team won 47 games in a row in the national tournament and the Reykjavík Tournament.\nReturn to the playoffs: The Borce Ilievski era..\nIn November 2015, ÍR fired Bjarni Magnússon after a bad start and replaced him with assistant coach Borce Ilievski. With Ilievski, the teams fortune did not change at first and the team finished 4-12 the rest of the way, finishing 10th and missing out of the playoffs. The following season, the team fared better and won 11 out of 22 games, good for a seventh place finish and a trip to the playoffs for the first time in six years. In the playoffs, ÍR lost to second seeded Stjarnan in three games.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, ÍR signed former Marshall University center, Ryan Taylor. Taylor's performances alongside point guard Matthías Orri Sigurðarson got ÍR into second place in the league after the regular season. In the playoffs ÍR faced seventh seeded Stjarnan in the first round. Following the third game of the series, which ÍR won, Taylor was suspended for three games for having hit Stjarnan's center Hlynur Bæringsson, in the back of the head. Despite this, ÍR won the series 3-1. Taylor missed the first two games of the second round series against eventual finalists Tindastóll. Tindastóll dispatched of ÍR in four games, 3-1.\nDespite the heartbreaking loss in the previous year there was optimism in ÍR for the 2018–19 season. Taylor had left and was replaced by Americans Gerald Robinson and Justin Martin. The season did not go as well as the previous year. Martin was released from his contract in January, despite having had a 50 point game a couple weeks earlier. Former Westchester Knick, Kevin Capers, was signed to replace him.\nÍR scraped into the playoffs as a 7th seed and was due to face second seeded Njarðvík in the first round. ÍR lost the first game away from home as Capers was ejected for having slapped an opposing player in the head. Capers was suspended for the second game as ÍR found themselves in a 0-2 hole in a best of five series.\nCapers returned in a away victory in game three. The victory sparked hope in the ÍR team which eventually came back and won the series 3-2 to set up a meeting with rivals and league champions Stjarnan. ÍR and Stjarnan had faced off in the Icelandic Cup semi-finals a few months earlier, won by Stjarnan but the game was most remembered for the fight that ensued between the teams supporter groups. Ghetto Hooligans and Silfurskeiðin.\nStjarnan totally obliterated ÍR in the first game in Ásgarður. Brandon Rozzell dominated the game and many counted ÍR out of the series after the first game. Things would not get so simple for Stjarnan as ÍR won two games in a row and was suddenly in position to defeat Stjarnan in game four at home. Stjarnan won in Seljaskóli to set up ÍR's second game five of the post-season.\nThe winner of the series would go on and face five-time champion powerhouse KR which had had a disappointing regular season and finished as the fifth seed. ÍR won game five and got into the finals for the first time since the playoff format was introduced in 1983.\nIn game one at KR the atmosphere was electric as Matthías Sigurðarson, formerly of KR, scored two free throws at the end of the fourth quarter to get into over time. In OT ÍR dominated and captain Sigurkarl Jóhannesson dunked as time expired as commentator Henry Gunnarsson yelled,: \"The giant (KR) has been knocked out. The giant has been knocked out.\"\nThe star studded, title winning KR team took game two in Hertz-hellirinn in four quarters. In game three KR took control and lead for most of the game. ÍR's loud fanbase was silenced as shot after shot went down for KR, but a performance long remembered by the fans by Kevin Capers kept ÍR in the game and eventually secured another overtime in a dramatic fashion.\nThe tense situation continued in overtime and as the game was tied in the dying seconds KR thought they had stolen the ball and would have an opportunity to score the game winner. A foul was called which allowed ÍR the chance to win in DHL-höllin for the second time in a row, in overtime in the finals and take a 2-1 series lead against the five-time consecutive champions.\nKevin Capers waited as the shot clock ran down, made his move. Three seconds left and the ball was tossed to veteran forward Trausti Eiríksson who found 21-year old captain Sigurkarl Jóhannesson open in the corner. Jóhannesson's three hit the net as time expired and ÍR had the chance to win the championship at home in game four.\nWith the Íslandsmeistarabikar in a crowded Hertz-hellir for game four ÍR started strong and led by 15 in the third quarter but the experienced KR team found a way to get back and took game four and set up ÍR's third game five in three series. The loss was a heartbreak for ÍR but the bigger shock would come the day after. After having been fouled hard by Jón Arnór Stefánsson, former Dallas Maverick, KR-legend and widely regarded as the greatest Icelandic player ever, Kevin Capers had broken his hand and was out for the final game of the season, the title clincher.\nMissing their best scorer ÍR faltered and after a first quarter shooting clinic by KR point guard Mike DiNunno and KR eventually won their sixth title in a row.\nOn 22 October, the Borce Ilievski era came to an end when he resigned from ÍR following a 0–3 start to the 2021–22 season.\nArena.\nÍR plays its home games at the TM-Hellirinn.\nEuropean record.\nIn September 1975 ÍR was drawn from a pool of teams to face Real Madrid in the 1975–76 FIBA European Champions Cup. While they were eligible as the national champions to do so, the team never intended to participate in the tournament due to high costs involved and thus didn't register for it nor pay the participation fees. A letter by the Icelandic Basketball Association which informed FIBA on which Icelandic teams where eligible to participate in official FIBA tournaments was mistakenly taken as a confirmation of their participation.

All ten conference members qualify for the championship meet, which is held in three rounds. The winner of the championship receives a regional berth to the NCAA Division I Women's Golf Championships. The tournament began in 1999 and is rotated to different courses each year, with the various conference members acting as host. Through the 2024 championship, Kent State has won all 25 titles, a conference record for consecutive championships in any sport.\nHistory and format.\nThe championship was organized in 1999 after several conference members added women's golf as a varsity sport in the late 1990s. It is played in late April and consists of three rounds of stroke play held over three days with all ten conference members participating. The 2005 championship only had two rounds played instead of the originally scheduled three due to weather.

The inaugural championship, held at the Kings Island Golf Course in Mason, Ohio, consisted of seven teams: Bowling Green, Eastern Michigan, Kent State, Northern Illinois, Ohio, Toledo, and Western Michigan.

It was founded in 1947, and are headquartered in Nieuwegein.\nBasketball Nederland operates the Netherlands men's national team and Netherlands women's national team. They organise national competitions in the Netherlands, for both the men's and women's senior teams, as well as the youth national basketball teams.\nThe top professional league in the Netherlands is the BNXT League.\nHistory.\nFoundation (1947).\nThe Dutch Basketball Association (, \"NBB\") was founded on 15 July 1947. After World War II in which the Dutch were conquered by the Nazis it began a priority to build governing bodies for their national sports. Even much so that the Netherlands started a basketball federation before basketball power United States. Which didn't establish their own federation until the 1970s.\nEarly years (1947–1961).\nAt the beginning, the NBB started with less than a thousand members and 120 teams from Amsterdam, Haarlem and Rotterdam joined. Basketball was a sport that wasn't practiced all over the country, but especially in Amsterdam. It is logical, therefore, that the NBB derives from the Amsterdam Basketball Federation, founded in 1945.\nDutch Basketball Success (1962–1991).\nDuring the time period from 1962 to 1991 basketball saw huge growth in the Netherlands. Partially due to the success of the Dutch national team, which made ten European Championship appearances in that span.\nAlso during this time was the foundation and beginnings of the Dutch Basketball League (DBL). Which received tons of fan support.\nRegression (1991–2012).\nDuring the time period from 1991 to 2012 the national team took a deep decline, and failed to qualify for the European Championship.\nIn June 2019, the organisation rebranded to Basketball Nederland."

        "text": "Pool A of the 2019 Rugby World Cup began on 20 September 2019. The pool included hosts Japan, and previous 2015 Rugby World Cup quarter-finalists Ireland and Scotland. They were joined by the European qualifier, Russia, and Samoa, the winner of the European-Oceania Cross-Regional play-off.\nJapan won all four of their matches, including surprise victories over both Ireland and Scotland, to finish top of the pool and become the first Asian nation to reach a Rugby World Cup quarter-final. Ireland picked up a bonus point in each of their matches, and their victory over Scotland in their opening pool match proved the difference between the two sides in the hunt for second place. Samoa finished in fourth place, their only win coming against bottom-placed Russia.\nOverview.\nThe opening match of the 2019 Rugby World Cup was played in Pool A with Japan scoring a 30–10 win over Russia. Kotaro Matsushima became the first Japanese player to score a hat-trick at a World Cup. For the Russian side, Kirill Golosnitsky scored the first try of the tournament after four minutes – the fastest try ever scored in the opening match of a World Cup. Two days later, Ireland defeated Scotland 27–3. On 24 September, Samoa played their first match against Russia in Kumagaya. Despite Samoa's being reduced to 13 men after Rey Lee-Lo and Motu Matu'u were sin-binned within two minutes of each other, Russia could not capitalise on their advantage and Samoa went on to win 34–9. Four days later, hosts Japan defeated Ireland 19–12, scoring four out of six penalties. While it was an upset win for Japan, World Rugby later admitted three of the four offside penalties were incorrectly awarded to Japan. Kenki Fukuoka scored a try in the 58th minute to give Japan a two-point lead after Ireland's Garry Ringrose and Rob Kearney had scored the opening two tries. Yu Tamura's conversion and fourth successful penalty kick sealed the result for Japan. Scotland recorded their first victory of the World Cup with a 34–0 whitewash victory over Samoa in muggy conditions in Kobe, with Samoan captain Jack Lam stating that the rugby ball was \"a bar of soap.\"\nThree days later, Kobe Misaki Stadium held another match in Pool A – this time it was Ireland, who would whitewash their opponents (Russia) in a 35–0 victory with five different players getting tries for the Irish. The Irish though, did not have everything go right with Jordi Murphy being subbed off in the 27th minute due to a possible rib injury, which added to the Irish back row pain after losing Jack Conan earlier in the tournament. Japan recorded their third victory over Samoa in Toyota with a 85th minute try from Kotaro Matsushima sealing the Japanese a 38–19 bonus point victory. Russia in the final match of the tournament was hammered by Scotland 61–0 with George Horne scoring a hat-trick as the Scots became the first team in World Cup history to not concede a point from two World Cup matches. A red card to Bundee Aki in the 29th minute forced Ireland to go down to 14 men but that was the only blemish with Ireland winning 47–5 over Samoa in Fukuoka. Johnny Sexton scoring two tries for the Irish. Typhoon Hagibis saw the Japan–Scotland match under threat with the Scottish Rugby Union demanding legal action if it was cancelled. But after an inspection deemed the match to go ahead, Japan held their nerve against a fast-finishing Scotland to take home a 28–21 victory with Kenki Fukuoka scoring two tries. The win saw Japan become the first Tier 2 team to qualify since 2007, as they topped the group while Ireland finished in second place.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times are local Japan Standard Time (UTC+09)\"\nJapan vs Russia.\n&lt;section begin=a1 /&gt;&lt;section end=a1 /&gt;\nNotes:\nIreland vs Scotland.\n&lt;section begin=a2 /&gt;&lt;section end=a2 /&gt;\nNotes:\nRussia vs Samoa.\nNotes:\nJapan vs Ireland.\nNotes:\nScotland vs Samoa.\nNotes:\nIreland vs Russia.\nNotes:\nJapan vs Samoa.\nNotes:\nScotland vs Russia.\nNotes:\nJapan vs Scotland.\nNotes:"

The pool included title holders New Zealand and third-placed team from 2015 South Africa, while Italy also joined the pool after finishing third in their pool in 2015. They were joined by the African qualifier, Namibia, and the repechage winner, Canada.\nNeither of the final two matches in the pool were played due to the effects of Typhoon Hagibis; New Zealand were a point behind South Africa, who had played all four of their matches, going into the final game against Italy, so the two points awarded for the cancelled match saw New Zealand take top spot in the pool, while Italy finished third behind South Africa. Neither Namibia nor Canada managed a win in their first three matches, and the cancellation of their final match meant they finished level on points, with Namibia finishing higher on points difference.\nOverview.\nPool B started with New Zealand beating South Africa 23–13. New Zealand opened their scoring with two tries in four minutes from George Bridge and Scott Barrett giving New Zealand a 17–3 lead at half-time. Pieter-Steph du Toit scored a converted try to bring the score back to 17–10 but two penalties from Richie Mo'unga and Beauden Barrett sealed the result. In Higashiōsaka, Italy conceded an early try against Namibia before running away with a bonus-point victory by 25 points. Italy earned a second bonus-point victory in Fukuoka, scoring seven tries in a 48–7 demolition of Canada. Over in Toyota, South Africa defeated Namibia by 54 points, scoring nine tries while Namibia could manage only a Cliven Loubser penalty in the 23rd minute. New Zealand recorded their second victory of the World Cup with a 63–0 victory over Canada at Ōita Stadium. For New Zealand, Brad Weber scored his first two tries in international rugby with the Barrett brothers (Jordie Barrett, Beauden Barrett and Scott Barrett) each scoring a try as they became first trio of brothers to start for New Zealand.\nNew Zealand would continue their demolition of their opponents with a 62-point win over Namibia in Chōfu, with the floodgates opening in the second half after Namibia restricted the All Blacks to 24 points in the first half. Sevu Reece, Ben Smith and Anton Lienert-Brown scoring two tries in the match. Between the two New Zealand games, South Africa romped over Italy with Cheslin Kolbe scoring two tries as the South Africans won 49–3 in Fukuroi. This was followed by a 66–7 victory over Canada with Cobus Reinach scoring the fastest hat-trick in World Cup history, with his three tries being scored in a space of 11 minutes. The final two matches of the group would not be played as Typhoon Hagibis would see the cancellation of the New Zealand–Italy and Namibia–Canada matches. At the end of the pool stage, New Zealand finished on top of the table with South Africa finishing second.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times are local Japan Standard Time (UTC+09)\"\nNew Zealand vs South Africa.\nNotes:\nItaly vs Namibia.\nNotes:\nItaly vs Canada.\nNotes:\nNew Zealand vs Canada.\nNotes:\nSouth Africa vs Italy.\nNotes:\nSouth Africa vs Canada.\nNotes:\nNew Zealand vs Italy.\nNotes:\nNamibia vs Canada.\nNotes:"

They were joined by regional qualifiers from the Americas, United States \"(Americas 1)\", and Oceania, Tonga \"(Oceania 2)\", to become the first completed table ahead of the World Cup.\nEngland and France both went unbeaten in their first three matches to guarantee qualification for the knockout stage, but their final match against each other was cancelled due to the effects of Typhoon Hagibis. England had earned a bonus point in all three of their matches, while France had just one, so England went through to the quarter-finals as pool winners. With bonus point victories against Tonga and the United States, Argentina claimed third place and the final automatic qualification spot for the 2023 Rugby World Cup, while Tonga's win over the United States in the final pool match saw them finish fourth.\nOverview.\nPool C's opening match saw Argentina come back from a 17-point half-time deficit against France at Tokyo Stadium, only for France's Camille Lopez to score a game-winning drop goal in the 70th minute. In Sapporo, two tries from Manu Tuilagi helped England to a bonus-point victory over Tonga. England followed that up with a 38-point victory over the United States, with Joe Cokanasiga scoring two tries in the victory; however, the match was soured by the first red card of the tournament, shown to the United States' John Quill for a shoulder charge to the head of England's Owen Farrell. Argentina bounced back from their defeat by France with a 28–12 victory over Tonga in Higashiōsaka; all of Argentina's scoring happened in the first 28 minutes, including a hat-trick from Julián Montoya as they raced to a 28-point lead before Tonga brought the margin back to 16 with two tries of their own. After Typhoon Mitag almost cancelled the match, the French were inconsistent with errors keeping the United States in the match before three late tries in the second half would secure a 33–9 win in Fukuoka.\nIn Chōfu, England qualified for the quarter-finals with a 39–10 victory over Argentina with Argentinean player Tomás Lavanini being shown a red card, which forced Argentina down to 14 men as he was forced off due to a high tackle on Owen Farrell's head. France would later join them in qualifying for the knockout stage with a two-point victory over Tonga at Kumamoto Stadium. After conceding the first 17 points of the match, Tonga came back into the match with tries from Sonatane Takulua and Mali Hingano to close the gap to only three points before Romain Ntamack gave the cushion that France needed with two penalties in eight minutes giving France the victory. Argentina would become the first team to finish their matches of the 2019 World Cup, with a 47–17 victory over the United States in Kumagaya. Joaquín Tuculet and Juan Cruz Mallia each scored two tries in the meeting, their first since 2003. After the England–France game was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, Tonga ended their World Cup campaign with a 31–19 victory over the United States. This was due to the Tongan's using their opportunities with them converting into tries and despite the United States being within striking range with three minutes to go, Telusa Veainu converted the match-winning try and a bonus-point victory for Tonga. At the end of the pool stage, it was England winning the group with France finishing in second place.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times are local Japan Standard Time (UTC+09)\"\nFrance vs Argentina.\nNotes:\nArgentina vs Tonga.\nNotes:\nFrance vs United States.\nNotes:\nEngland vs Argentina.\nNotes:\nFrance vs Tonga.\nNotes:\nArgentina vs United States.\nNotes:\nEngland vs France.\nNotes:"

It ran alongside the 2017–18 Top 14 competition; both competitions are operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nTeams.\nChanges in the lineup from 2016–17 were:\nCompetition format.\nThe regular season uses a double round-robin format, in which each team plays the others home and away.\nThe LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007–08 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons.\nFrance's bonus point system operates as follows:\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, Pro D2 conducts a play-off system identical to the one currently used in Top 14, with the top six teams qualifying for the play-offs and the top two teams receiving byes into the semi-finals. The winner of the play-offs earns the league championship and automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a play-off with the second-from-bottom Top 14 team, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14.\nThis replaced the previous system in which the top team at the end of the regular season was declared champion, also earning a Top 14 place, while the second- through fifth-place teams competed in promotion play-offs. The play-off semi-finals were played at the home ground of the higher-ranked team. The final was then played on neutral ground, and the winner earned the second ticket to the next Top 14.\nPromotion.\nPro D2 to Top 14.\nAs noted above, both promotion places will be determined by play-offs from 2017 to 2018 forward, with the winner of the Pro D2 play-offs earning promotion and the runner-up playing the second-from-bottom Top 14 team for the next season's final Top 14 place.\nFédérale 1 to Pro D2.\nAt the same time, LNR and the French Rugby Federation (FFR) will change the promotion process from Fédérale 1 to Pro D2. For three seasons (2017–18 to 2019–20), only one team will be promoted to Pro D2 through the Fédérale 1 competition. The second promotion place will be a \"wild card\" granted by LNR to a club that meets the following criteria:\nStarting with the 2020–21 season, LNR will create a third professional league, slotting between Pro D2 and Fédérale 1 in the league system.\nRelegation.\nNormally, the teams that finish in 15th and 16th places in the table are relegated to Fédérale 1 at the end of the season. In certain circumstances, \"financial reasons\" may cause a higher-placed team to be demoted instead, or bar a Fédérale 1 team from promotion.\nRelegation playoff.\nThe team finishing in 13th place of the Top 14 faces the runner-up of Pro D2, with the winner of this match playing in Top 14 in 2018–19 and the loser in Pro D2.\nLeading scorers.\nNote: Flags to the left of player names indicate national team as has been defined under World Rugby eligibility rules, or primary nationality for players who have not yet earned international senior caps.

        "text": "Pool D of the 2019 Rugby World Cup began on 21 September 2019. The pool included 2015 runners-up and quarter-finalists Australia and Wales. They were joined by Georgia, who automatically qualified for the first ever time. They were joined by regional qualifiers from the Americas, Uruguay \"(Americas 2)\", and Oceania, Fiji \"(Oceania 1)\".\nWales and Australia qualified for the quarter-finals, with Wales taking top spot in the pool courtesy of a 29–25 win over the Wallabies in the two sides' second match of the tournament. Fiji, Georgia and Uruguay each won one match, but three bonus points for Fiji meant they finished in third place and qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nOverview.\nPool D opened with Australia beating Fiji by 18 points in Sapporo after Fiji led by two points at half-time. Australia scored four tries in the second half for the bonus point. Wales beat Georgia 43–14 at City of Toyota Stadium, after leading 29–0 at half-time and 22–0 after three tries in the first 19 minutes. In Kamaishi, Fiji scored the opening try against Uruguay. Two mistakes within eight minutes gave Teros the lead before a try from Juan Manuel Cat enhanced it to 12 points at half-time. Three Fijian tries in the second half were to no avail as two penalty goals from Felipe Berchesi gave Uruguay their first win in a World Cup since 2003. In Kumagaya on 29 September, Georgia recorded a 33–7 win over Uruguay. Dominant work by their forwards in the second half laid the foundation for the bonus-point victory. Over in Chōfu, Dan Biggar scored the fastest drop goal in World Cup history as Wales led 23–8 at the half. Two second-half tries from Australia brought the scores to within a point but the Welsh held out for a 29–25 win.\nA second half performance from Fiji at a wet Hanazono Rugby Stadium saw the Fijians record their first win of their 2019 World Cup campaign as they won 45–10 over Georgia. This was partly due to Semi Radradra scoring two tries while also aiding in setting up three more tries as Fiji scored seven tries to one in the bonus-point victory. Another slow start for the Australians in their game with Uruguay did not stop them from recording a win over the South Americans, with Tevita Kuridrani and Dane Haylett-Petty each getting two tries in the 35-point victory at Ōita Stadium. Four days later at the same stadium, Fiji got off to a 10–0 lead with the tries coming from Josua Tuisova and Kini Murimurivalu within eight minutes. Fiji would hold their lead until the 31st minute when Josh Adams scored his second try of three for the match. Wales increased their lead from there to win 29–17, qualifying for the quarter-finals with Australia. The penultimate match of Pool D saw Australia outlast a tough Georgia in difficult conditions in Fukuroi, as they won 27–8. Wales would finish undefeated with a 35–13 win over Uruguay at Kumamoto Stadium to record a bonus-point victory and set up a quarter-final with France while Australia came in second.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\n\"All times are local Japan Standard Time (UTC+09)\"\nWales vs Georgia.\nNotes:\nFiji vs Uruguay.\nNotes:\nGeorgia vs Uruguay.\nNotes:\nAustralia vs Wales.\nNotes:\nGeorgia vs Fiji.\nNotes:\nAustralia vs Uruguay.\nNotes:\nWales vs Fiji.\nNotes:\nAustralia vs Georgia.\nNotes:\nWales vs Uruguay.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Basketball in New Zealand",
        "text": "The sport of basketball was first played in New Zealand in 1908.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1908).\nWhile basketball was invented by James Naismith in 1891, it did not reach New Zealand until the early 1900s. A former Naismith student, J. H. Greenwood, introduced basketball to New Zealand when he was appointed physical director of the Wellington branch of the YMCA in 1908. The sport was called indoor basketball to avoid confusion with the English offshoot of basketball played by females outdoors. New Zealand women's basketball was renamed netball in 1970. The YMCA spread the game from the 1920s, often with the help of American Mormon missionaries. By the mid-1930s men's and women's indoor basketball associations had been set up in the main cities and some smaller centres. From the start, both sexes were involved, the YMCA organising the men's leagues and the YWCA the women's. In 1935 the Auckland women's association had 14 teams. The first national indoor basketball tournament was held in Wellington in 1938. The 1939 national tournament, also in Wellington, drew a large crowd of spectators and was a hit with locals and local youth.\nPost-war growth (1945–70).\nBasketball's post-war growth was steady but unspectacular. Encouragement and resources to spread the game were supplied by the Physical Welfare and Recreation Branch of the Internal Affairs Department. But a lack of facilities impeded development. Basic technique, the coaching expertise to teach basketball and the regular competition to hone skills were all also lacking. The government-sponsored construction of war memorial community halls, in which basketball could be played, helped to alleviate the facilities obstacle. Between 1946 and 1961 the NZMIBA grew from 16 affiliated associations comprising 366 teams to 31 associations with 750 teams.\nThe deepening influence of Mormon missionaries in the game improved player skills as well as coaching. Between 1946 and 1961, at the conclusion of the national men's tournament, a New Zealand team would play a team of Mormon missionaries. The national team won the contest for the first time in 1951, hailed as New Zealand's first international basketball victory.\nAlthough the NZMIBA welcomed the Mormons’ contribution to coaching – they introduced teams to zone defense – it was forced to ban the Mormons from proselytising at games in 1961. The game also benefited from visits from American coaches organised through the United States government. These included John Wooden, Stu Inman and \nRed Auerbach.\nCreation of national leagues (1980s).\nThe 1980s ushered in a period of exceptional growth and popularity for the sport. Late in 1981, six men's teams – a mixture of club and provincial representative sides – went out alone and created an inaugural national league. It was enough of a success to come under the control of the NZBF the following year, when it grew in size and secured a naming sponsor. An allowance of two imported players (invariably Americans with college basketball experience) per team, and the fact that games were played in the evening indoors, helped turn the league into a new family entertainment option. Spectators filled gymnasiums and media coverage reached unprecedented levels.\nEmblematic of these boom years was the league final played in Wellington in 1985 between local side Exchequer Saints and the Auckland Stars. Won by Saints in the final second of overtime, from a shot fired behind the three-point line by American import Kenny McFadden, the game was broadcast live on television to 750,000 viewers. Soon after the league's establishment, a men's second division was created, followed in 1986 by a women's national league. These new competitions superseded the old national tournament system at senior level.\nFall &amp; rise (1990 onwards).\nCompetition from other indoor sports like cricket and netball, a lack of player development and poor management decisions were all factors in the decline of the national men's league in the early 1990s. Television coverage dropped, sponsorship dried up and public support waned. The sport's showpiece soon became a shadow of what it had been. The women's national league also experienced a sponsorship drought and dwindling crowds. In 1995 it was split into three provincial competitions – two in the North Island and one in the South – with a week-long tournament final to find a national champion.\nNational team success.\nA lack of competition for the national men's team in the late 1980s was reversed in the early 1990s, with ever more matches with United States college teams and international sides. A bright spot was the first-time attendance of the national women's team at the World Championships in Australia in 1994. The team, by now officially dubbed the ‘Tall Ferns’ (at the same time the men became the ‘Tall Blacks’), won one game, defeating Kenya 93–76.\nIn 1998 the Keith Mair-coached Tall Blacks beat Canada 85–79, a win that one commentator said confirmed ‘the Tall Blacks coming of age as a legitimate international basketball force.’1 In the same year the New Zealand Basketball Federation changed its name to Basketball New Zealand (BBNZ). Both national sides made their Olympic debuts in 2000 at Sydney, where each claimed a single victory.\nIn 2001 the Tall Blacks stunned the basketball world with a 2–1 home series victory over Australia in the world championship qualifying series. The best was yet to come. At the world tournament the following year in Indianapolis, the Tall Blacks set about toppling giant after giant: Russia and China both fell to the Kiwis. Puerto Rico was then defeated in the quarter-finals. The New Zealanders’ run only came to an end in the semi-finals against Yugoslavia, and the Tall Blacks eventually finished fourth in the world.\nOverview.\nNew Zealand has one professional basketball team, the New Zealand Breakers, who compete in the Australian National Basketball League (ANBL). They do, however, have a semi-professional league which runs during winter months, the National Basketball League (New Zealand), with 9 teams competing. These teams attract strong local followings but their popularity pales in comparison to the NZ Breakers.\nIn 2001, they defeated Australia in a three-game series to qualify for the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis. At the tournament they finished fourth, after beating Puerto Rico in the quarter-finals before losses to Yugoslavia and Germany. Tall Blacks captain Pero Cameron was the only non-NBA player named to the all-tournament team in Indianapolis.\nThe Tall Blacks qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but again finished with a 1–5 record and lost to Australia in the playoff for ninth place. Their most noted moment was on the 7th day of the games, when they beat Serbia and Montenegro, 90–87.\nThe most well-known former New Zealand player Sean Marks who has retired from the National Basketball Association and currently being an assistant coach in San Antonio Spurs, with Kirk Penney and Steven Adams being the other players from New Zealand to play in the NBA."

        "title": "History of baseball in Texas",
        "text": "Like many other states in the United States, Texas has a long history with the game of baseball.\n19th century: the beginning of baseball in Texas.\nThe birth of baseball in Texas happened at the same time as the Civil War in 1861 with the formation of the Houston Base Ball Club to promote the game the same way Alexander Cartwright had during the 1840s with the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club in Manhattan. Baseball was played in Galveston and other Lone Star State locations prior to the war. The distribution of the game was interrupted by the Civil War but would pick up by the end of the war. Baseball was played during the war mostly by Yankees but occasionally by Confederates. A humorous story by Texas-based Union soldier George A. Putnam told of a baseball game interrupted by Confederate gunfire. Putnam stated: \nOn April 21, 1868, the first occurrence of a baseball game was taken into account by the \"Houston Post\". At the San Jacinto Battlegrounds near Houston, where General Sam Houston led Texas to triumph in the War of Independence from Mexico in 1836, a baseball game took place on the anniversary now celebrated as San Jacinto Day. The Houston Stonewalls defeated the Galveston Robert E. Lees, 35–2, that rivaled the result of what originally happened on the same site.\nBaseball spread throughout the state in the next two decades as a popular amateur game. The influence of what the Houston club had done in the early 1860s, along with those who acquired the nuances of the game from Civil War travels and immigrants who moved to Texas during the Reconstruction Era, helped in organizing the sport and bringing more attention to the game in the state. Scarcely a generation after the state's first recorded game in 1868, Texas fielded 100 minor league clubs—more than any other state.\nThe acceptance of baseball had greatly expanded throughout Texas by the end of the 19th century. Houston Base Ball Club was a founding member of the Texas League in 1888 and also won their first league pennant the next year. The Houston ballclub went by the nicknames of Babies, Red Stockings, Mud Cats, Magnolias, and Wanderers before the Houston Buffaloes name became permanent around the turn of the 20th century.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor league.\nThe Texas League helped to make professional baseball popular in the state beginning in the late 19th century. There were teams in Austin, Beaumont, Cleburne, Corsicana, Dallas, Fort Worth, Galveston, Greenville, Houston, Paris, San Antonio, Sherman, Temple, Texarkana, and Waco. The Texas League is presently a Major League Baseball (MLB) affiliated minor league at the AA level. Not all the teams in the league are in Texas. However, both of the state's two MLB franchises, the Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros, have teams in Texas in the league. The Rangers' affiliate is the Frisco RoughRiders, while the Astros' affiliate is the Corpus Christi Hooks.\nAlong with the Texas League, there have been many baseball leagues that briefly existed in Texas or included at least one team from the Lone Star State such as: Lone Star Colored League of Texas, Negro American League, Colored Texas League, Texas Negro League, Texas-Oklahoma Negro League, South Texas Negro League, West Texas Negro League, Mexican National League, Central Baseball League, American Association, All-American Association, South Central League, Arkansas State League, Cotton States League, Rio Grande Valley League, Rio Grande Association, Southwestern League, Panhandle-Pecos Valley League, Longhorn League, North Texas League, West Texas–New Mexico League, Sooner State League, Arizona–Texas League, Lone Star League, Big State League, Gulf States League, East Texas League, Texas Association, Arkansas–Texas League, West Texas League, South Texas League, Middle Texas League, Central Texas League, Texas-Southern League, Texas–Louisiana League, Texas Valley League, Texas–Oklahoma League, Southwest Texas League, Evangeline League, West Dixie League, Gulf Coast League, Western Association, Texas Winter League, United League Baseball, Continental Baseball League, and Sophomore League. In addition to MLB and the Texas League, present-day teams compete in the Pacific Coast League, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, the Pecos League, and the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.\nAmateur baseball.\nCollege baseball.\nCollege baseball also has been a staple of Texas culture, and Texas collegiate baseball programs can be found throughout the different levels of college athletics. NCAA Division I conferences that currently include Texas teams are the American Athletic Conference, Big 12 Conference, Conference USA, Missouri Valley Conference, Southeastern Conference, Southland Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, Sun Belt Conference, and Western Athletic Conference. Many of the major programs (Baylor, Houston, Rice, Southern Methodist (SMU), Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Christian (TCU), and Texas Tech) previously all played together in the Southwest Conference (SWC). SMU ended its baseball program in 1980, and the SWC dissolved in 1996.\nOther conferences that include one or more Texas collegiate baseball programs are the Heartland Conference, Lone Star Conference, American Southwest Conference, Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, Red River Athletic Conference, Sooner Athletic Conference, Southwest Junior College Conference, Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, Western Junior College Athletic Conference, and NAIA independent schools (University of Houston–Victoria).\nTexas has some intense in-state rivalries such as the Battle of the Brazos between Texas A&amp;M and Baylor University, Houston-Rice rivalry, the Holy War between Baylor and TCU, Battle of the Piney Woods between Sam Houston State and Stephen F. Austin State University, and the Lone Star Showdown between the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&amp;M Aggies. Other in-state rivalries include Sam Houston State–Rice, Texas–Rice, Texas State–Rice, Texas State–University of Texas at San Antonio, Texas Tech–Baylor, Texas–Texas Tech, Texas Tech–Texas A&amp;M, Texas–Baylor, Sam Houston State–Houston, Texas Southern–Prairie View A&amp;M, St. Mary's–University of the Incarnate Word, Dallas Baptist–Houston Baptist as well as other esoteric rivalries.\nTournaments, like the Southwest Diamond Classic in Frisco, Texas, Whataburger College Classic in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston College Classic played at Minute Maid Park, take place in late February because of the more convenient, warmer weather."

In the early 1980s he took up a tennis scholarship to Wichita State University in Kansas. After graduating in June 1984 he competed for two years on the professional tour.\nAt the 1984 Australian Open, just months after turning professional, Houston made it through to the third round, where he lost a competitive match to the defending champion Mats Wilander. Playing as a qualifier, Houston had straight set victories over Craig Miller and former Australian Open winner Mark Edmondson, which put him up against the Swedish second seed in the third round. He managed to take Wilander to four sets, winning the second 6–2 and getting to a tiebreak in the third. Wilander won it in the fourth and went on to win the tournament.\nFollowing his performances at the Australian Open, he gained entry to Grand Prix tournaments in Sydney and Melbourne, for a first round exit in each. In Melbourne he also competed in the doubles with John Frawley and made it to the quarter-finals.\nIn 1985 his appearances were restricted to Challengers, although he made it to the second round of qualifying at Wimbledon and played doubles at a Brisbane Grand Prix tournament. Mid-year he reached his highest ranking, 280 in the world. His loss to Mark Kratzmann in the Australian Open qualifying round that year was his final professional match."

The defending champions were Wout van Aert in the men's competition and Sophie de Boer in the women's competition.\nBoth elite titles were won at the penultimate round of the season at Nommay. Despite finishing twelfth in the race, Sanne Cant won the women's title after her closest rival Kaitlin Keough finished the Nommay race in second behind compatriot Katie Compton.

        "text": "David John Peterson (born September 3, 1995) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB).\nEarly life and amateur career.\nPeterson's parents, Shannon and Doug, divorced when Peterson was a child. Peterson spent much of his childhood in stables with his father, a horse trainer who trained the likes of Seattle Slew. When Peterson was nine years old, his father died of an accidental drug overdose. Between eighth grade and his freshman year of high school, he grew ten inches.\nPeterson attended Regis Jesuit High School in Aurora, Colorado. In 2013, he played in the Under Armour All-America Baseball Game at Wrigley Field. Before his senior year, he broke his fibula during a basketball game, underwent surgery and missed his entire senior baseball season. As a result, he fell to the 28th round of the 2014 MLB Draft. Peterson chose not to sign with the Boston Red Sox and instead enrolled at the University of Oregon, where he played college baseball for the Ducks.\nPeterson started 14 games as a freshman at Oregon in 2015, going 4–6 with a 4.39 earned run average (ERA) and 81 strikeouts. As a sophomore in 2016, he went 4–5 with a 3.63 ERA and 61 strikeouts over 13 starts. During the summer, he played for the United States national collegiate team. Peterson became Oregon's number one starter in 2017. On March 3, he set a school record with 17 strikeouts, breaking the previous record of 14 held by Tyler Anderson. On April 29, he broke his record after recording 20.\nProfessional career.\nPeterson was drafted by the New York Mets with the 20th pick in the first round of the 2017 MLB draft. He signed and was assigned to the Brooklyn Cyclones, where he spent the whole season, posting a 2.45 ERA in three games.\nMLB.com ranked Peterson as New York's second best prospect going into the 2018 season. He began 2018 with the Columbia Fireflies and was promoted to the St. Lucie Mets in June. In 22 total starts between the two teams, he went 7–10 with a 3.16 ERA. He spent 2019 with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, going 3–6 with a 4.19 ERA over 24 starts, striking out 122 batters over 116 innings.\nPeterson had his contract selected to the 40-man roster on July 28, 2020. He made his major league debut on that same day, against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, getting the win after pitching innings, giving up two runs on seven hits and an error with two walks and three strikeouts in 78 pitches. After the start, Peterson described it as \"one of the greatest days of\" his life.\nPeterson was placed on the 10-day injured list before his start against the Miami Marlins on August 18, 2020, due to left shoulder fatigue, an issue that had arisen following his outing against the Washington Nationals on August 13, 2020. He returned to the active roster two weeks later and finished the season 6–2 with a 3.44 ERA over 10 games (9 starts).\nOn July 2, 2021, Peterson was placed on the injured list with an oblique strain. On July 24, Peterson was transferred to the 60-day injured list. He finished the year having made 15 starts with a 2–6 record, 5.54 ERA, and 69 strikeouts across innings of work. In 2022, Peterson made 28 appearances (19 starts) for the Mets, registering a 7–5 record and 3.83 ERA with a 126 strikeouts across innings pitched.\nPeterson made 27 appearances (21 starts) for New York in 2023, pitching to a 3–8 record and 5.03 ERA with a career–high 128 strikeouts in 111.0 innings of work. Following the season on November 8, 2023, Peterson underwent surgery to repair a damaged labrum in his left hip, with an expected recovery time of six–to–seven months."

In 1898, the club relocated to Trafford Park, with Trafford Hall becoming the clubhouse. With the lease on the course expiring, the club was on the move again in 1912, this time to Hopwood Park. The 18-hole course at Hopwood Park was designed by Harry Shapland Colt. In 1925, the club secured its home when it bought the freehold. The course has since been lengthened, from its original 6145 yards, to 6491 yards."

There are no official cricket clubs in Albania, and expats occasionally play exhibition games between one another.\nHistory.\nCricket was first introduced to Albania in August 2001 through European Cricket Council coach and Englishman Tim Dellor. The UK-based charity, Children's Aid Direct had set up the cricket event at the Selman Stërmasi Stadium in the capital Tirana for 50 orphans and refugees. Previously, Albania had the most tenuous of links with cricket, in that C. B. Fry, captain of England cricket, was once offered the throne of the country, to which he declined.\nThe first recorded game of cricket to be played in Albania took place at the Internacional Complex in Pezë Helmës near Tirana on 24 May 2015 between Albanian Eagles and International Lions. Leka II, Crown Prince of Albania was the honorary captain of the Albanian Eagles, while English writer and comedian Tony Hawks captained the International Lions, with the game being won by Albanian Eagles won by 1 run and were all out for 49. The game was sponsored by Crown Agents who awarded the winning side with the Sir Norman Wisdom Trophy, named after English actor and comedian Wisdom who had a cult following during the Communist regime in Albania."

        "title": "Robert Thomas (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Robert Thomas (born July 2, 1999) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and alternate captain for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL). \nA native of Aurora, Ontario, Thomas played Bantam and AAA ice hockey with the York Simcoe Express before beginning his major junior ice hockey career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). He spent three seasons in the OHL with the London Knights and Hamilton Bulldogs. While with the Knights, Thomas won the 2016 Memorial Cup as a rookie and was drafted in the first round, 20th overall, by the Blues in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut on October 4, 2017, against the Winnipeg Jets and recorded his first career NHL goal a month later. As the youngest player on the Blues' roster, Thomas won the Stanley Cup in 2019.\nInternationally, Thomas has competed for the Canadian national junior team in various tournaments since 2015. He won a gold medal for his home country during the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge and 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nEarly life.\nThomas was born on July 2, 1999, in Aurora, Ontario. His father Scott, a chef by trade, trained Thomas for the first five years of his hockey career. His grandfather Bruce Waechter also helped by building a backyard rink out of plywood for him to train on.\nPlaying career.\nYouth.\nGrowing up in Aurora, Thomas played Bantam and AAA ice hockey with the York Simcoe Express of the Eastern AAA Minor Midget Hockey League. During the 2014–15 season, Thomas recorded 45 points in 34 games for the Express. As he grew out of Bantam hockey, Thomas played for the St. Andrew's College Saints under-16 team for two years while also attending the private school. His younger brother would also attend and graduate from the school in 2019.\nMajor junior.\nThomas was selected by the London Knights of the OHL in the second round, 26th overall, in the 2015 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection. Knights coach Dale Hunter praised Thomas for his \"vision, speed, hockey sense and ability to pass the puck\" and considered him a replacement for former Knight Bo Horvat. In his rookie season with the Knights, Thomas recorded 15 points in 40 games as they qualified for the 2016 OHL Playoffs. He played with the team as they reached the J. Ross Robertson Cup and won the 2016 Memorial Cup. Thomas played his rookie season as a defensive forward, which he developed into a more offensive role prior to his sophomore season.\nThomas developed into a more offensive role with the Knights during the 2016–17 season and recorded a career high 66 points in 66 games. As a result, he was named to the 2017 CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game alongside teammate Alex Formenton and was the recipient of the OHL's Most Sportsmanlike Player of the Year Award. His offensive play also earned him a boost in ranking from 28th to 22nd amongst North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Thomas shared his surprise at his jump in ranking by saying, \"I actually was expecting, from talking to people, to go in the third round...I was talking to a lot of (U.S. schools) at the time, and when I jumped to the second, I was pretty shocked.\" He was eventually chosen in the first round, 20th overall, by the St. Louis Blues and invited to their rookie camp over the summer. \nFollowing an impressive training camp and pre-season with the Blues, Thomas was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract on September 28, 2017, before he was returned to continue his development with the London Knights for the 2017–18 season. As the Knights were waiting on key players to return from their respective NHL clubs, the Knights began the season with a rocky start and a 1-4-0 record. On November 3, 2017, Thomas was named captain of the Knights, alongside alternate captains Sam Miletic, Max Jones, Cliff Pu, and Evan Bouchard. Shortly thereafter, he recorded the game-winning goal to clinch coach Dale Hunter his 700th regular season win. His run as captain was short-lived, however, as on January 8, 2018, Thomas was traded to the Hamilton Bulldogs in exchange for Connor McMichael and five draft picks. While with the Bulldogs, Thomas was suspended five games for slashing Peterborough Petes forward Zach Gallant in the mouth, though he still finished the regular season tied for 20th around the league in scoring. He continued his scoring success during the 2018 OHL Playoffs and recorded 32 points in 21 games to help the team clinch the J. Ross Robertson Cup. As a result of his success, Thomas was awarded the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as MVP of the playoffs. \nProfessional.\nUpon the conclusion of the 2018 Memorial Cup Semifinal game, Thomas revealed he suffered an ankle injury during the Bulldogs series against the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds. As a result, Thomas was unable to attend the Blues' development camp, but was medically cleared to play during the Blues' Rookie Camp on September 5, 2018. Thomas eventually made the Blues' opening night roster for the 2018–19 season, and subsequently made his NHL debut on October 4 against the Winnipeg Jets. However, during the following six games, Thomas was a healthy scratch in the Blues' lineup for two of them. Working his way back into the lineup, Thomas recorded his first NHL point on October 12 in a 5–3 win over the Calgary Flames, and his first NHL goal on November 21 in a 4–1 loss to the Nashville Predators. Thomas remained on the team's roster for the entirety of the season and finished with 33 points in 70 games as the Blues qualified for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. \nAt the age of 19, Thomas helped the Blues advance to conference final by assisting on both goals during Game 7 of the Western Conference Second Round. Afterwards, former Blues player Keith Tkachuk said, \"For someone that young, to clearly stand out in a Game 7 from start to finish, was one of the best performances you have ever seen in the National Hockey League, in my opinion.\" As the youngest player competing during the Western Conference Final against the San Jose Sharks, he suffered a wrist injury during Game 6 as the Blues beat the Sharks. He returned to the lineup for Game 1 of the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins, but suffered another injury and was out of the lineup until Game 6. His efforts during the postseason helped the Blues win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. Upon winning the Cup, Thomas' hometown of Aurora added a sign underneath their city's welcome sign stating \"Home of Robert Thomas, Stanley Cup champion.\"\nPrior to the 2019–20 season, Thomas underwent surgery to repair a tendon in his left wrist. He was eventually medically cleared to play and was once again named to the Blues' opening night roster. Leading up to opening night, Thomas was expected to have a breakout season and a \"Smooth sophomore season\" in the top six. Although the NHL suspended play due to COVID-19, Thomas placed fifth on the team in goals per game and first with primary assists. During the pause in play, Thomas captained a league-wide Fortnite tournament for charity with teammates Vince Dunn and Jordan Kyrou. Together, they finished in second place and donated $50,000 to the St. Louis Children's Hospital, $25,000 to the St. Louis Area Foodbank, and $25,000 to muscular dystrophy research.\nThomas began the shortened 2020–21 season strong by tallying one goal and five assists for six points through the first 12 games of the season. However, he suffered a thumb injury on February 6, 2021, and was expected to be sidelined for 4–6 weeks. Thomas returned to the Blues' lineup for their game against the Golden Knights on March 22, 2021, over a month after his initial injury. He was a minus-1 in 13:26 minutes of ice time as the Blues fell 5–1. However, his return was shortlived as he suffered a lower body injury during a game against the Minnesota Wild on April 10. He subsequently missed four games before rejoining the Blues on April 23. Thomas signed a two-year, $5.6 million contract extension with the Blues on September 21, 2021.\nOn July 13, 2022, Thomas signed an eight-year, $65 million extension with the Blues.\nInternational play.\nAs a citizen of Canada, Thomas has competed for the Canadian national junior team in various tournaments since 2015. During his rookie season with the London Knights, Thomas was released by the team to allow him to compete with the Canadian national junior team at the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. He played in six games and recorded one point for Team Canada White as they clinched a gold medal.\nOn June 20, 2017, Thomas was selected to attend the Canada men's national junior ice hockey team U20 Team Summer Development Camp prior to the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Playing alongside fellow Blues prospect Jordan Kyrou, Thomas helped Canada clinch a gold medal after a 3–1 win against the Sweden men's national junior ice hockey team.\nPlayer profile.\nThomas has drawn comparisons to Patrice Bergeron, with Blues' Development Coach Tim Taylor saying \"...Not to throw names out there, but we believe he's like a Jonathan Toews for our team, a Patrice Bergeron, a guy that can go out and do everything. Right now, we don't want to put that pressure on him. We just want him to be the player that he is. But I think that we believe he has those leadership qualities. His structure on the ice is impeccable. His two-way game, two-way faceoffs were really good this year. We have high expectations for him and he has them for himself, too.\""

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career complete games leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a complete game (denoted by CG) is the act of a pitcher pitching an entire game without the benefit of a closer. A pitcher who meets this criterion will be credited with a complete game regardless of the number of innings played - pitchers who throw an entire official game that is shortened by rain will still be credited with a complete game, while starting pitchers who are relieved in extra innings after throwing nine or more innings will not be credited with a complete game. A starting pitcher who is replaced by a pinch hitter in the final half inning of a game will still be credited with a complete game.\nCy Young is the all-time leader in complete games with 749 and the only player to complete more than 700 games. Pud Galvin is second all-time with 646 career complete games and the only other player to complete more than 600 games. No active pitcher has yet to even reach 30 career complete games."

        "text": "Shane Bowers (born July 30, 1999) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward for the Utica Comets of the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect with the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League (NHL). Bowers was drafted in the first round, 28th overall, of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. He has also played for the Colorado Avalanche.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nBowers, a Herring Cove native, first played in Halifax, Nova Scotia as a standout at the Bantam level for the Bubba Ray's Gulls before playing in the Nova Scotia Major Midget Hockey League with the Halifax McDonald's.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Bowers was selected as the NSMMHL's MVP, registering most goals and points in both the regular and post-season. Bowers twice turned down opportunities to play in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) for a major junior ice hockey team in his native Canada after he was selected in consecutive Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Entry Drafts by the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles and Saint John Sea Dogs. He opted to instead play in the United States, after he was selected 38th overall by the Waterloo Black Hawks in the 2015 United States Hockey League Futures Draft.\nJoining the Black Hawks for the 2015–16 season, Bowers showed his two-way potential in contributing with 15 goals and 33 points, leading all in 56 games, leading all Waterloo rookies to earn a selection to the All-Rookie Second Team. In returning for his second season with Waterloo in 2016–17, Bowers announced his intention on pursuing a collegiate career, committing to Boston University of the Hockey East. In playing on the Black Hawks' top line, Bowers improved his season totals finishing 10th in the league scoring in producing 22 goals, 29 assists for 51 points in 60 games. He earned the USHL Third All-Star Team honors, however Waterloo was unable to advance past the Western Conference finals in a 3-2 series defeat against the Sioux City Musketeers.\nApproaching the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, Bowers was the 16th-ranked North American skater by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau before being selected 28th overall in the first round by the Ottawa Senators. In joining the Boston Terriers as a freshman for the 2017–18 season, Bowers made his collegiate debut, scoring a goal against Union College on September 30, 2017. He scored in his first three NCAA games, including his first multi-goal game against Minnesota State University on October 14, 2017.\nOn November 5, 2017, Bowers' NHL rights were included by the Senators in a blockbuster three-way deal, heading to Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Matt Duchene. In continuing with the Terriers, Bowers appeared in all 40 games and finished third on the team with 32 points and second in goals with 17. Bowers had a team-best plus-16 rating and on March 14, 2018, Bowers and teammate Brady Tkachuk were selected to the Hockey East Rookie Team. Bowers also received an honourable mention for the Hockey East all-star squads, but was not selected for those teams.\nIn the 2018–19 season, Bowers returned for his sophomore season with the Terriers. Under the reign of new head coach Albie O'Connell, Boston struggled to replicate their previous seasons success, failing to qualify for the NCAA Tournament. Bowers playing in a second-line role finished third on the team with 11 goals and fourth in scoring with 21 points in 37 games.\nProfessional.\nAfter two seasons with Boston University, Bowers opted to conclude his collegiate career, turning pro in signing a three-year, entry-level contract with the Colorado Avalanche on March 29, 2019. He was immediately signed by the Avalanche's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Colorado Eagles, on an amateur try-out contract in their bid for a playoff berth.\nDuring the 2022–23 season, Bowers made his NHL debut with the Avalanche on November 10, 2022, against the Nashville Predators. However, he suffered an injury and had to leave the game after less than two minutes of ice time. On December 14, 2022, in returning from injury he was re-assigned to continue with the Colorado Eagles. Bowers added 14 points through 37 games with the Eagles before he was traded by the Avalanche to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Keith Kinkaid on February 25, 2023. Assigned directly to their AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins, Bowers played out the remainder of the season in posting 3 goals and 7 points through 20 regular season games.\nAs an impending restricted free agent, Bowers brief tenure with the Bruins ended after he was traded to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Reilly Walsh on June 26, 2023. He was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Devils for the 2023–24 season on June 29, 2023. Bowers failed to make the Devils out of training camp and was placed on waivers for the purposes of being assigned to the Devils AHL affiliate, the Utica Comets. On January 9, 2024, Bowers was recalled from Utica, playing in three games with the Devils before being returned to the AHL after Timo Meier returned from injury.\nOn April 30, 2024, Bowers was re-signed by the Devils to a two-year, two-way contract extension.\nInternational play.\nBowers made his international debut, captaining Canada Black at the 2015 World U-17 Hockey Challenge before playing at the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, scoring one goal in four appearances for Canada junior team.\nDuring his sophomore season with the Terriers, Bowers was selected to participate for Canada at the 2019 World Junior Championships. Chosen for his responsible two-way game, Bowers played as centre on the third line registering two assists in five games before suffering a shock elimination in a 2–1 overtime loss to Finland junior team in the quarterfinals on January 2, 2019, to place sixth."

        "title": "Durham County Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Durham County Rugby Football Union is the governing body for the sport of rugby union in the historic county of Durham in England. The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Durham County, it administers and organises rugby union clubs, competitions and Durham county rugby representative teams.\nHistory.\nOrganized rugby union as we know it was first played in the county in 1850 when Durham School took up the game, and the first club side followed in 1863, when Darlington was formed. In October 1876 the Durham County Rugby Football Union was formed, with a preliminary meeting on 10 October followed by the first recorded meeting of representatives later that month on the 31st. The 31 October meeting was chaired by P.B. Junor and attended by representatives from six local clubs; Bensham, Darlington, Durham University, Houghton, Stockton, Sunderland and Westoe. The first recorded official of the Durham County RFU was J.B. Brooks, the chairman of Darlington, who became the honorary secretary and retained this title until 1980. An unofficial county side is believed to have played a match as early as March 1875, when they faced Yorkshire in Leeds\nAn official county team was formed soon after the creation of the Durham County RFU, with games in the early years largely restricted to meetings with nearby Yorkshire, and the majority of players were supplied by the two powerhouse clubs of the day, Darlington and Sunderland. In 1878 Durham went further afield, linking up with Northumberland to send a combined side down to face Lancashire in Manchester. As the union started to grow, new clubs appeared such as Hartlepool Rovers (1879) and West Hartlepool (1881). In the middle of this a Challenge Cup competition was introduced in 1880, giving the clubs proper competition and in turn increasing the popularity of rugby union in the region.\nDurham became a member of the Rugby Football Union in 1882, and the advent of the County Championship in 1890 saw them among the first counties to take part in this illustrious competition. They won their first championship in 1900, beating Devon 11–3 in the final held at Exeter, and they quickly went on to dominate the County Championships. In between 1900 and 1910 they had appeared in all ten finals, coming away with six victories, one of which was shared with Devon. During this period of dominance, Durham boasted an overall record of having scored 740 points to their opponents 293. \nThe success enjoyed during the 20th century would start to fade, and although Durham made two further final appearances in 1914 and 1932 they were unable to add any further trophies. It was only until 1967 that they tasted success again, sharing the trophy with Surrey after two drawn games. In 1989 Durham won the County Championship for the eight time, defeating Cornwall 13–9 at Twickenham Stadium. Once one of the most decorated sides in the Championships, in recent times Durham have flickered back and forth between Division 1 and Division 2 of the championships, with their last Twickenham appearance being the 2014 County Championship Plate final which they lost 31–23 to Kent.\nDurham County senior men's county side.\nDurham County senior men's currently play in the Bill Beaumont Cup - the first division of the County Championship - having been promoted from the Division 2 at the end of the 2017–18 season. \nHonours:\nNotable players for the County side.\nSee \nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 30 clubs affiliated with the Durham County RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. Most clubs are based in County Durham but there are also teams from Tyne and Wear.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Durham County RFU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in County Durham:\nCups.\nDurham County RFU run the following cup competitions for 1st teams:\nAs well as a number of cup competitions for 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th teams:\nFinally, there is also a cup competition for clubs in Hartlepool:"
