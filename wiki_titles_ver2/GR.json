        "text": "Karl Taylor (born May 4, 1971) is a Canadian professional ice hockey head coach for the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL). He previously served as the head coach of the Chicago Wolves, Texas Stars, and Ontario Reign.\nAfter concluding his major junior career in 1991, Taylor spent five years with the University of New Brunswick (UNB) men's ice hockey team. He then took a year off from hockey to complete his Master's degree before returning to UNB as an assistant coach in 1997. During his short tenure with the UNB Reds, Taylor helped lead them to the 1998 CIAU championships.\nEarly life.\nTaylor was born on May 4, 1971, in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. As a teenager, Taylor moved to Barrie, Ontario in order to play with the Barrie Colts of the Southern Ontario Junior \"B\" Hockey League. Following his first season with the Colts, Taylor was drafted 15th overall by the Windsor Spitfires in the 1988 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Midget Priority Draft. While with the Spitfires, Taylor was moved from his original position of left wing to defence. He scored eight goals and added 15 assists during the 1988–1989 season before being traded to the London Knights in January 1990. His tenure with the Knights was short-lived however, as he was traded to the North Bay Centennials in November 1990.\nCollegiate and assistant coaching career.\nTaylor concluded his major junior career in 1991 to play five years with the University of New Brunswick (UNB) men's ice hockey team. He then took a year off from hockey to complete his Master's degree before accepting an assistant coaching position with a Fredericton midget AAA team. Taylor spent one year with the team before returning to UNB as an assistant coach in 1997. During his short tenure with the UNB Reds, Taylor helped lead them to the 1998 CIAU championships. At UNB, Taylor was convinced by head coach Mike Johnson to join the National Coaching Institute (NCI) where he completed his master's degree in Sports Management.\nUpon returning from the NCI, Taylor became a co-coach late in the season with the Calgary Flames midget AAA team along with Mark Howell. While attending a symposium, he was notified of an opening for a coaching position with the Red Deer College Kings ice hockey team. He eventually accepted the position in May 2000. Prior to his first season in this role, Taylor lost two defencemen and struggled to fill the lineup. He was eventually let go from the organization after three years as he failed to complete one the requirements of his probation.\nProfessional coaching career.\nUpon leaving Red Deer College, Taylor was named head coach and director of hockey operations for the Reading Royals of the ECHL prior to the 2005–06 season. During his first season with the team, Taylor led them to a 42–23–7 regular-season record and was selected as the co-coach for the American Conference at the ECHL's 2006 All-Star game. This marked the organization's second 40-plus win season in team history and third consecutive playoff appearance. In his third season with the team, Taylor amassed a 112–82–22 total record as the Royals lost in the second round of the 2008 Kelly Cup playoffs to the eventual-champion Cincinnati Cyclones. He eventually left the Royals organization in 2008 once they landed an ECHL affiliation with the Los Angeles Kings and became the first head coach of the Ontario Reign. During their inaugural season, Taylor helped lead the team to a 7–4–1–1 record through their first 13 games. Their success continued through the 2008–09 season as he helped them capture the 2009 Pacific Division championship.\nTaylor remained with the Reign until 2011 when he accepted an assistant coaching position with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League (AHL). He spent the 2011–12 season with the Wolves, where he helped the club post a 42–27–7 record during the regular season to win the Midwest Division title. Following his first tenure in the AHL, Taylor spent one season as a scout for the Vancouver Canucks before joining the Portland Winterhawks organization in the Western Hockey League (WHL) as an assistant coach. As an assistant coach with the Winterhawks, Taylor helped lead them to a 54–13–5 record and advance to the 2014 WHL Championship Finals against the Edmonton Oil Kings. As such, he was recruited by the Dallas Stars organization to coach their AHL affiliate, the Texas Stars, during the 2014–15 season.\nTaylor remained with the Stars organization for four years, amassing a 152–108–30–14 record as they made the playoffs in three of his four seasons. In his final season with the Stars organization, Taylor led the team to a 38–24–14 regular-season record as they met with the Toronto Marlies in the 2018 Calder Cup Finals. He eventually left the Stars to become head coach of Milwaukee Admirals, the AHL affiliate of the Nashville Predators. During the 2019–20 season, Taylor received the Louis A. R. Pieri Memorial Award as the league's most outstanding coach during the season. As a result of the NHL's COVID-19 protocol, Taylor was called up to the NHL as a replacement for the Predators' head coach in December 2021. He subsequently coached the Predators to a 5–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche on December 17, 2021.\nPersonal life.\nTaylor and his wife, Bev, have two children together. They spend much of their offseason at a family farm in Saskatchewan."

This was UConn's first loss in the women's national championship game.\nParticipants.\nSouth Carolina.\nThe Gamecocks, who represent the University of South Carolina and play their home games at Colonial Life Arena in Columbia, came to the championship game after being ranked No. 1 in every poll from the preseason through this matchup, the final game of the year. Led by coach of the year Dawn Staley and player of the year Aliyah Boston, South Carolina defeated a healthy UConn team in November's Battle 4 Atlantis tournament final, 73–57.\nSouth Carolina lost only two games during the season: one in overtime against unranked Missouri in December, and one in the SEC Tournament, where the unranked Kentucky Wildcats surprised the Gamecocks in the finals. In the NCAA Tournament, South Carolina drew a No. 1 seed in the Greensboro Regional, where they won handily against Howard and Miami on their home court, then defeated a scrappy No. 5 seed North Carolina team. They then dominated Cinderella No. 10 seed Creighton in Greensboro to advance to the Final Four. The Gamecocks defeated Louisville, who never led after the second quarter, to advance to their second consecutive March Madness finals.\nThe Gamecocks entered this game with no injuries which affected their lineup.\nUConn.\nThe Huskies, who represent the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, and split their home games between Gampel Pavilion and XL Center, came to the finals after a 30–5 season, an uncharacteristic year in which eight different players suffered injuries which kept them out of two or more games. UConn started the season ranked No. 2 behind the Gamecocks. Coached by Hall of Famers Geno Auriemma and Chris Dailey and led by last year's player of the year Paige Bueckers, UConn utilized eleven different starting lineups; eight different players led the Huskies in scoring in games during the season. In December, Bueckers suffered a broken bone in her knee, which kept her out of play for nineteen games, but she rejoined the team in late February with limited minutes until the NCAA Tournament. Bueckers's injury gave Auriemma and Dailey unexpected opportunities to develop blue-chip freshmen as scorers, while three seniors and several experienced sophomores anchored the team.\nUConn lost regular season games against unranked Georgia Tech, Oregon, and Villanova, while losing to No. 6 Louisville in December. A healthy UConn dominated the Big East Tournament, defeating Villanova in the finals. In the NCAA Tournament, the No. 2 seed Huskies beat Mercer and struggled on their home court against a physical UCF team. At the Bridgeport regional, UConn defeated Indiana, then emerged victorious in a game that announcers called an \"instant classic\", a two-overtime 91–87 contest against No. 1 seed NC State. In a Final Four contest against Stanford, UConn out-rebounded the taller Cardinal squad and the Huskies' stifling defense held the defending national champions to a 34.8% shooting percentage to advance to this final with a 63–58 win.\nSenior forward Dorka Juhász suffered a wrist injury during the NC State contest and was the only starter injured for this contest.\nGame summary.\nSouth Carolina jumped out to a 5–0 lead, and held a nine-point lead by the first timeout in the game, three and a half minutes into the contest. The Gamecocks already had seven second-chance points and eight rebounds. Aliyah Boston made a jump shot with 19 seconds to go in the first quarter, giving the Gamecocks a 22–8 lead. South Carolina had seven offensive rebounds in the quarter and held a 12–3 edge in rebounds.\nOne minute passed in the second quarter before Destanni Henderson scored its first points on a three-pointer, as in the first quarter. UConn followed with two jump shots and the Gamecocks made a layup before Henderson scored another three-pointer with 7:38 to play, extending the Gamecocks' lead to 18 points. A pair of shots by Paige Bueckers narrowed the deficit to 16 with seven minutes left, and the Huskies further made up ground after Bueckers made one of her two free throws with just over five minutes left. A minute-long scoring drought by both teams was broken with 4:01 by Caroline Ducharme, though another scoring drought of nearly two minutes followed. This was again broken by a Ducharme layup, which narrowed the South Carolina lead to single digits for the first time since the score was 13–4 with four minutes remaining in the first quarter. Evina Westbrook and Henderson traded layups and Bueckers made a jump shot, which narrowed the deficit to seven points, and a free throw by Saniya Rivers with 23 seconds left bumped the lead to eight. This would be the final scoring play of the first half, and the Gamecocks took a 35–27 lead to the locker room.\nUConn began the second half with the ball, but two missed shots resulted in no points from their first possession. Boston opened the second half scoring with a layup 54 seconds into the half, and South Carolina's lead was pushed to eleven points with a free throw from Zia Cooke just under two minutes later. Boston made one of two free throws with 6:19 to play and Henderson made both of hers six seconds later, and Cooke scored a layup with 5:18 on the clock, extending the Gamecocks' lead to sixteen points as a result of their 8–0 run. This run was broken seconds later by Bueckers, who scored a jump shot with an assist from Nika Mühl. Over two minutes passed with no scoring before Edwards scored a layup with 2:41. UConn continued their scoring run with three-point shots from Ducharme and Westbrook, and their 10–0 streak cut the Gamecocks' lead to six points. Henderson made a free throw and a jump shot in the quarter's final minute, giving South Carolina a nine-point lead at the conclusion of the third quarter.\nEdwards began the scoring in the fourth quarter for UConn, which was countered by a pair of layups by Henderson. Victaria Saxton made two free throws with just under seven minutes to play, and Ducharme made a layup to bring the lead down to eleven. A free throw from Boston and a jumper and layup from Henderson pushed the lead to sixteen points. Azzi Fudd and Bueckers made three-pointers for UConn with 4:09 and 3:23 to play, respectively, which brought the lead to within ten points for the final time. UConn began fouling around this time, as the game's next five points were scored on free throws by Henderson, Saxton, and Hall. UConn's final points of the contest would come with 1:51 to play, as Williams made a layup to make it 62–49. From there, Boston would score two free throws with 1:15 remaining before the Gamecocks would be able to run the clock out and claim their second national championship, 64–49.\nBoston finished with 11 points and a team-high 16 rebounds for her Division I-high 30th double-double of the season. She was named the tournament's MOP. South Carolina outrebounded UConn by 25, one of the largest margins in the championship game's history. Bueckers had 14 points and six rebounds for UConn.\nMedia coverage.\nThe championship game was televised in the United States by ESPN. The game was the most-viewed women's national championship broadcast since 2004, as it drew an average viewership of 4.85 million, with a peak viewership of 5.91 million. This reflected an 18% increase in viewership over the previous season's title game. It was also the most-watched ESPN college basketball broadcast since 2008."

        "title": "College Basketball on TNT Sports",
        "text": "College Basketball on TNT Sports is the de facto title of college basketball coverage produced by TNT Sports for TNT, TBS, TruTV and NBA TV.\nHistory.\nEarly TBS games (1982–1983).\nOn December 11, 1982, TBS (with the aid of more than 100 independent network affiliates and stations) broadcast a contest between Virginia and Georgetown (led by Ralph Sampson and Patrick Ewing respectively). The game in question (in which TBS paid approximately US$600,000 for the broadcasting rights) was called by Skip Caray and Abe Lemons. On November 26, 1983, TBS broadcast a contest between Kentucky and Louisville. TBS, in a joint venture with Sports Production Inc. of Dallas, paid $600,000 for the rights to the game. Skip Carey and Joe Dean were on the call of the game.\nMarch Madness Era (2011–present).\nOn April 22, 2010, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) reached a 14-year agreement, worth US$10.8 billion, with CBS and the Turner Broadcasting System to receive joint broadcast rights to the Division I men's college basketball tournament. This came after speculation that ESPN would try to obtain the rights to future tournament games. The NCAA took advantage of an opt-out clause in its 1999 deal with CBS (which ran through 2013, even though the NCAA had the option of ending the agreement after the 2010 championship) to announce its intention to sign a new contract with CBS and Turner Sports, a division of WarnerMedia (which later was absorbed into Warner Bros. Discovery who, incidentally, jointly owned The CW with the CBS television network's corporate parent Paramount Global). The new contract came amid serious consideration by the NCAA of expanding the tournament to 68 teams.\nThe agreement, which runs through 2032 (extended from 2024 in 2016), stipulates that all games are available nationally. All First Four games air on truTV. During the first and second rounds, a featured game in each time \"window\" is broadcast terrestrially on CBS (15 games), while all other games are shown on TBS (12 games), TNT (12 games) or truTV (nine exclusive games, from 2024 on select TNT and/or TBS games may get a simulcast on TruTV when that network is not airing any games). Sweet 16 (regional semifinal) and Elite 8 (regional finals) games are split among CBS and TBS. In 2014 and 2015, Turner channels had exclusive rights to the Final Four (with standard coverage airing on TBS), and CBS broadcast the championship game. Since 2016, rights to the Final Four and championship game alternate between Turner and CBS; the 2016 tournament marked the first time that the national championship game was not broadcast on over-the-air television.\nIn 2011, TruTV acquired the rights to the preseason Coaches vs. Cancer Classic, beginning with 2012. The tournament was the first regular season games aired by TNT Sports since 1983. The tournament was discontinued after the 2014 edition.\nIn 2023, TNT and TruTV began airing the \"Hall of Fame Series\". The four game event features two early afternoon games on TruTV and two primetime games on TNT. Two of the four games featured Women's college basketball, which had never aired on TNT or TruTV prior to 2023.\nHBCU games (2021–present).\nRegular season basketball produced by TNT Sports returned during the 2020–21 season. NBA TV, which is operated by TNT Sports, televised 2 college basketball games as part of a doubleheader on February 22, 2021. The telecasts featured both men's and women's college basketball games between Jackson State University and Grambling State University and were the first college basketball games ever on the network.\nPrior to the 2021–22 season, TNT Sports expanded its HBCU coverage when it reached an agreement to air the Invesco QQQ Legacy Classic, a two-game event featuring four HBCU teams, on TNT. TNT utilized the March Madness graphics package for these games. Also, as part of its NBA All-Star Game coverage, NBA TV began producing the NBA-HBCU Classic game, which is also simulcast on TNT and ESPN2. In 2022, NBA TV also aired four other regular season games from the SWAC. On February 5, 2022, NBA aired a doubleheader of men's and women's college basketball games between Florida A&amp;M University and Texas Southern University. On February 12, 2022, NBA aired a doubleheader of Men's and Women's college basketball games between Texas Southern University and Grambling State University."

        "text": "The 2022 United States Open Championship was the 122nd U.S. Open, the national open golf championship of the United States. It was a 72-hole stroke play tournament that was played between June 16–19 at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb west of Boston. It was the club's fourth U.S. Open, having been held there in 1913, 1963, and 1988.\nMatt Fitzpatrick won his first major championship, finishing the tournament with a score of 274, six-under-par, a shot ahead of Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris. The win was also Fitzpatrick's first on the PGA Tour. He had previously won the U.S. Amateur at The Country Club, in 2013, and matched Jack Nicklaus, who won both at Pebble Beach, as the only players to win the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Open on the same course. Zalatoris, who lost in a playoff a month earlier at the PGA Championship, had a 14-foot birdie putt on the 18th green that would have forced a playoff but missed, and had his second consecutive runner-up finish in a major championship.\nCourse.\nComposite Course\nSources:\nYardage by round\nField.\nThe field for the U.S. Open is made up of players who gain entry through qualifying events and those who are exempt from qualifying.

The overnight leaders, Joel Dahmen and Collin Morikawa, dropped down the leaderboard with Dahmen scoring 74 and Morikawa 77.\nSource:\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 19, 2022\"\nSummary.\nBeginning the round tied for the lead with Will Zalatoris, Matt Fitzpatrick went two-under-par on his front-nine to take a one-shot advantage into the final nine holes at six-under-par. He then bogeyed the 10th hole and three-putted the 11th for another bogey, to fall back to four-under and two strokes behind the leaders. Fitzpatrick holed a 48-foot birdie putt at the 13th hole, to draw level with Zalatoris and retook sole possession of the lead with a 19-foot putt at the 15th.\nZalatoris bogeyed two of his first three holes and was as many as four shots behind the leaders. He then made three birdies in four holes from the 6th hole to the 9th and took the lead with an 18-foot birdie putt at the 11th hole. He bogeyed the 12th and the 15th, after failing to get up-and-down from a greenside bunker, and fell back to four-under-par, before hitting his tee shot on the par-three 16th hole to six feet and making the putt to get within one of Fitzpatick.\nZalatoris had a 12-foot putt for birdie on the 17th hole to draw level with Fitzpatrick, but missed the putt. With a one-shot lead playing the 18th, Fitzpatrick drove into a fairway bunker and played his second shot 18 feet past the hole. He two-putted for par and a round of 68, two-under-par, to finish at six-under for the tournament. Zalatoris, on a nearly identical line to Fitzpatrick, had a 14-foot putt for birdie that would have forced a playoff but it narrowly slid past the left side of the hole. He finished at five-under-par and his second consecutive runner-up finish in a major championship.\nWorld No. 1 and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler made four birdies in his first six holes to take the lead. He then bogeyed the 10th and three-putted the 11th, where his short par putt lipped out of the cup. Despite a birdie on the 17th, Scheffler finished at five-under-par, tied with Zalatoris and narrowly missing becoming only the seventh player to win both the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year.\nHideki Matsuyama had a bogey-free round of 65, the lowest recorded during the week, to jump up to three-under-par and finished alone in fourth place. Defending champion Jon Rahm began the round just a shot off the lead but made five bogeys and only one birdie in a four-over-par 74 to fall outside the top-10, finishing tied for 12th.\nFinal leaderboard.\nSource:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"\nSource:"

        "text": "The 2022 F1 Esports Series Pro Championship was an esports competition for Formula One which was the sixth season of the Formula One Esports Series. It was held in Formula One's official 2022 game. \nLucas Blakeley won the driver's championship for the first time, as McLaren Shadow won the team's championship for the first time. Jarno Opmeer and Mercedes-AMG Petronas Esports Team were the defending champions, having won the Drivers' and Teams' titles respectively in 2021.\nSeason report.\nEvent One.\nThe season started off in Bahrain. Lucas Blakeley took pole position and led from the start, but had to fend off the likes of Frederik Rasmussen and rookie Thomas Ronhaar, which caused him to lose ground to the reigning champion, Jarno Opmeer. Opmeer attempted an overcut, while Ronhaar sustained damaged and retired from the race. Blakeley was given a penalty by the game, but it was revoked by the stewards and it allowed him to win ahead of Opmeer and his new teammate, Bari Broumand.\nAt the next round in Imola, Ronhaar took his first pole position in the series. On the first lap, Opmeer was tagged from the back and fell to eighteenth. A poor strategy from Ronhaar relegated him to fourth place, with Blakeley winning back-to-back races. Marcel Kiefer was second for his only podium of his final season in F1 Esports, with his teammate Rasmussen getting his first podium of the season.\nRasmussen claimed his first pole of the season at Silverstone. Ronhaar settled for a long stint behind him, which eventually led to a last-lap battle between the two. Rasmussen took his first win of the season; Ronhaar took his first podium of the season (and also the first of his career). Blakeley got past Sebastian Job for third.\nEvent Two.\nRasmussen took another pole position at the Red Bull Ring. He and Ronhaar fought in wet conditions, but eventually, Ronhaar took the lead to win his first race in F1 Esports. Rasmussen ended up second, with Josh Idowu taking his first podium behind. Opmeer was fourth from Nicolas Longuet, Blakeley, and Broumand.\nRasmussen again took pole at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. He battled Broumand throughout the race and fell back during the round of pit stops. Blakeley got pas Broumand, but only briefly as he retook the position; Idowu managed to overtake Blakeley later. Rasmussen’s pace advantage over Broumand resulted in a last-lap battle, but Broumand took the win from Rasmussen, Idowu, and Blakeley.\nRonhaar took pole at Zandvoort, his home race. A rainy starting ground caused Piotr Stachulec, Ronhaar’s teammate, to spin into Dani Moreno, Opmeer’s teammate. By Lap 10, everyone but Opmeer was on medium tires, with Opmeer going for the hard compound. His plan failed as he dropped from second to four. Blakeley won his third race of the season from Broumand, Rasmussen, and Opmeer, as pole-sitter Ronhaar ended up 9th.\nEvent Three.\nHeading into the second half of the season, Blakeley had 110 points compared to Rasmussen’s 95. Broumand was further back with 70 points, with Ronhaar and Opmeer on 63 and 60 points respectively.\nLonguet took pole position in Monza, as Opmeer was only eighteenth. At the start, Longuet had a snap of understeer, allowing Broumand to soar into the lead. Ronhaar got past Longuet as well to battle Broumand for the win, which he achieved in another last-lap battle. Longuet ended up in third. Rasmussen was fifth with Blakeley seventh.\nRasmussen took another pole in Mexico City. After the round of pitstops, Rasmussen forced Ronhaar off the road at Turn 6; he eventually got a ten-second time penalty. Opmeer won for the first time since last year on the same track, with Broumand and Ronhaar second and third respectively. Blakeley only managed 7th, and Rasmussen’s penalties sent him to twelfth at the end.\nRonhaar took his fourth pole position in Austin. After wet conditions at the start jumbled up the order, Broumand entered the final lap in the lead from Ronhaar, Opmeer, and Brendon Leigh. At Turn 12, Ronhaar forced Broumand to the outside, which allowed Opmeer and Leigh to join the battle. In the end, Opmeer won from Ronhaar, with Leigh taking his first podium in the series since 2020, and Broumand was only fourth. Rasmussen was fifth and Blakeley ended up in sixth. Opmeer’s win put him only 21 points behind championship leader Blakeley, effectively making it a five-way championship fight between them, Broumand, Ronhaar, and Rasmussen.\nGrand Final.\nRonhaar took another pole at Suzuka, but Longuet shot up in the lead at Turn 1. When multiple people pitted, Jake Benham held up everyone for one lap so that his teammate, Opmeer, would benefit from the pitstops. This would eventually fail, as Opmeer crashed into Fabrizio Donoso, putting him out of the race. Longuet eventually won the race from Ronhaar. With Blakeley third and Broumand fourth, McLaren Shadow won the team’s championship for the first time in Esports history.\nBlakeley took pole at Interlagos, his first pole since the first round. Mixed conditions during the race led Rasmussen and Broumand to fight for second position, with Rasmussen eventually getting the place only behind winner Blakeley. Ronhaar was only sixth and Opmeer was eighth. Broumand and Opmeer’s poor results meant that they were officially eliminated from the championship fight.\nIdowu took his second career pole position at the final round in Yas Island. On the first lap, Ronhaar shot into the lead and kept it for most of the race, but Rasmussen battled him in the latter stages. Rasmussen eventually won the race over Ronhaar, with Idowu behind in third. And with Lucas Blakeley fourth, he became the 2022 F1 Esports Champion, the first of his career and the fourth in the series.\nChampionship standings.\nScoring system.\nPoints were awarded to the top 10 classified finishers in the race and one point was given to the driver who set the fastest lap inside the top ten. No extra points are awarded to the pole-sitter.\nIn the event of a tie at the conclusion of the championship, a count-back system is used as a tie-breaker, with a driver's/constructor's best result used to decide the standings.\nTeams' Championship standings.\n Notes: "

        "text": "Minor league baseball franchises were based in Champaign, Illinois and neighboring Urbana, Illinois in various seasons between 1889 and 1914. Champaign and Urbana teams played as members of the Independent level Illinois-Indiana League in 1889 and the Class D level Illinois-Missouri League from 1911 to 1914, winning the 1914 league championship.\nHistory.\nThe 1889 Champaign–Urbana Clippers were the first minor league baseball team in Champaign–Urbana. The Clippers played as members of the Illinois-Indiana League, managed by F.L. Bliss. The Clippers replaced the Logansport, Indiana team, which had disbanded. The Champaign–Urbana Clippers record is unknown, but the Terre Haute, Indiana team won the league pennant. The Illinois–Indiana League became the Illinois-Iowa League in 1890 and the Champaign–Urbana Clippers did not return to the new league.\nIn 1911, minor league baseball returned when the Champaign–Urbana Velvets became members of the Class D level Illinois-Missouri League. The Velvets were joined by the Clinton Champs, Pekin Celestials, Canton Chinks, Lincoln Abes and Taylorville Christians in league play.\nWith a record of 66–60, the 1911 Champaign–Urbana Velvets finished in third place in the Illinois–Missouri League, playing under managers Jack Thiery and Fred Donovan. The Velvets finished 6.5 games behind the first place Clinton Champs in the final league standings. The Velvets' third place finish was reflected in the league standings with the Velvets finishing behind the Clinton Champs (74–55), and Pekin Celestials (72–55), with the Velvets ahead of the Canton Chinks (60–62), Lincoln Abes (59–64) and Taylorville Christians (47–82).\nThe franchise use of the \"Velvets\" moniker corresponded to a popular beer in the era, called Champaign Velvet, brewed by the Terre Haute Brewing Company.\nIn 1912, the franchise moved to a ballpark in Champaign, playing as the Champaign Velvets in the six–team Illinois–Missouri League. Champaign placed fifth in the regular season standings with a record of 53–64, finishing 17.0 games behind the first place Lincoln Abes. The 1912 Champaign manager was Chuck Fleming.\nThe 1913 Champaign Velvets placed second in the Illinois–Missouri League final standings. The Velvets finished 5.0 games behind the champion Lincoln Abes. Champaign had a 53–32 record, playing the season under manager Blackie Wilson.\nThe 1914 Champaign Velvets were the Illinois–Missouri League Champions in what was the final season of the Illinois–Missouri League. On June 10, 1914, Champaign pitcher Grover Baichley threw a no–hitter in a 4–0 victory over the Lincoln Abes. The 1914 Champaign Velvets ended the season with a 62–27 record, finishing 13.0 games ahead of the second place Ottawa Indians. The Velvets manager was again Blackie Wilson. Champaign was unable to defend their championship, as the Illinois–Missouri League permanently folded after the 1914 season.\nThe franchise had financial challenges typical of minor league baseball in the era. Ironically, given the team moniker, alcohol was banned from being sold in Champaign and the team abided by the law, which affected revenues. Tickets were $0.25 and every Wednesday home game was \"Ladies Day.\"\nThe Champaign–Urbana next hosted minor league baseball when the 1994 Champaign-Urbana Bandits played the season as members of the independent Great Central League.\nThe ballparks.\nAlthough the exact location and name is unknown, the 1911 Champaign–Urbana Velvets were noted to have played at a ballpark in east Urbana.\nThe exact location and name is unknown, but the Champaign Velvets reportedly played at a ballpark on the west side of Champaign from 1912 to 1914."

        "title": "Charleston, Illinois, minor league baseball history",
        "text": "Minor league baseball teams were based in Charleston, Illinois from 1906 to 1908, known under a different nickname each season. Charleston teams played as members of the Class D level 1906 Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League and the Eastern Illinois League in 1907 and 1908. Charleston hosted minor league home games at Urban Park Field.\nHistory.\nMinor league baseball began in Charleston, Illinois is 1906. The Mattoon–Charleston Canaries began play in the six–team Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League, when Mattoon, Illinois partnered with Charleston to field a team. The team founding was headed by the Mattoon City Railway Company, who ran the local interurban rail line. The Mattoon City Railway Company had built an amusement park located between Mattoon and Charleston where the ballpark was located. Mattoon-Charleston manager John Berryhill was hired as the manager/player and was paid $150 for the season. Fred More of Charleston was the teams' managing owner. Fans created the 'Canaries\" moniker, after the broomcorn cutters that flooded the region each fall. Per the league structure, the team salary limit was $1,000 per month and the league fee was $400. The local Journal-Gazette newspaper distributed badge buttons that declared it was the place for “base ball news.” The highest reported attendance at the games was over 1,000 for a game against Cairo in May, 1906.\nThe 1906 Mattoon–Charleston team was a last place team, placing sixth with a 57–74 record under managers Jack McCarthy and Bob Berryhill. The Canaries finished 23.5 games behind the first place Vincennes Alices in the final standings. The Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League folded after the 1906 season.\nThe Kitty League was unable to reorganize for the 1907 season and the Mattoon City Railway Company relinquished ownership of the team to stock companies as efforts to join the new Eastern Illinois League began. The Mattoon–Charleston Canary's management felt that the joint Mattoon-Charleston the team had not drawn well in 1906 due to the merger of the two towns. It was decided to separate and form two teams. Urban Park field was turned over to a Charleston–only team and the baseball equipment was given to a new stock company in Mattoon, for their Mattoon Ball Club. Mattoon and Charleston then created separate teams for 1907.\nWith the Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League folded, the Charleston Broom Corn Cutters became charter members of the 1907 Eastern Illinois League, which began play as a six–team Class D level league. The Centralia White Stockings, Mattoon Giants, Pana Coal Miners, Shelbyville Queen Citys and Taylorville Tailors joined Charleston in the league.\nCharleston finished the 1907 Eastern Illinois League standings in second place after beginning league play on May 12, 1907. The Broom Corn Cutters finished the 1907 season with a 71–49 record to place second in the league standings, playing under manager Nig Langdon. Charleston finished 4.0 games behind their new rival, the first place Mattoon Giants. Charleston's Andy Lotshaw led the league in home runs, with 10 and Bill Bartley led the league in Runs, with 51.\nOn May 22, 1907, Tug Wilson and Dougal McDonald of Charleston pitched a combined no-hitter in a game against the Taylorville Tailors in a 1–0 loss.\nIt was reported by the Associated Press that the league teams in Charleston, Mattoon, Pana and Paris were supported, “In great part from saloon interests.”\nCharleston continued play in the 1908 Eastern Illinois League as the Charleston Evangelists, but folded during the season. The team's \"Evangelists\" moniker likely was in reference to an evangelical movement led by former major league player Billy Sunday that promoted a ballot item on April 7, 1908, that sought to abolish alcohol in the region. After the election, six of the Eastern Illinois League's eight franchise cities voted to become dry and the league began to suffer financially. Billy Sunday moved his revival to Charleston in April 1908 and began a new crusade against the league teams playing baseball games on Sunday. In what was the final season of play for Charleston, the team folded on June 30, 1908, along with the Mattoon Giants. Art Ahring of Charleston was leading the league with a batting average of .355. The Evangelists had a 37–37 record under managers Herman Walters, Walter Madden and James Kerwin when the franchise permanently folded. The loss of Charleston and Mattoon left the league with six remaining teams. After the 1908 season, the Eastern Illinois League permanently folded.\nCharleston, Illinois has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nIn 1906, the Mattoon-Charleston Canaries were noted to have begun minor league play at the Urban Park field, which was located within the amusement park built by the Mattoon City Railway Company. The park was located between the two cities along the trolley line that connected Mattoon and Charleston. After the Mattoon team began play in 1907, Charleston took over use of the ballpark. Today, the Charleston Country Club occupies the site. The location of the Charleston Country Club is 8355 Country Club Road, Charleston, Illinois."

        "text": "Minor league baseball teams were based in McLeansboro, Illinois. In 1910 and 1911, McLeansboro teams played under three nicknames as members of the 1910 Southern Illinois League and the Kentucky-Illinois-Tennessee League from 1910 to 1911, winning two league championships in 1910. McLeansboro hosted home minor league games at Fairgrounds Park.\nHistory.\nThe McLeansboro Merchants began minor league play in 1910, a season that saw the team win championships in two different leagues under two different nicknames. The McLeansboro franchise was a charter member when the Southern Illinois League was formed for the 1910 season as a five–team Class D level league. The Southern Illinois League began play on May 30, 1910, with the charter franchises Eldorado, Illinois team, Harrisburg Merchants, Herrin, Illinois team and Mount Vernon Merchants joining McLeansboro in league play.\nThe Southern Illinois League permanently folded on July 11, 1910. The McLeansboro Merchants were in first place when the league folded. In the final 1910 standings, the McLeansboro Merchants were in first place with a 20–5 record when the Southern Illinois League folded. Playing under manager Ollie Gfroerer, McLeansboro finished 6.5 games ahead of Eldorado (14–12). They were followed by Herrin (8–11), the Mount Vernon Merchants (8–11) and Harrisburg Merchants (6–17) in the final standings.\nMcLeansboro immediately continued play in 1910 in a second league and won a second championship under manager Ollie Gfroerer. The franchise became members of the Class D level Kentucky-Illinois-Tennessee League (KITTY League) at the half–way point of the season. They were joined by the Harrisburg Merchants in moving to the Kitty League. The newly named McLeansboro Billikens had a record of 40–18 in the second half of the split–season schedule and won the second half title. There were no playoffs held, with McLeansboro and the Vincennes Alices, who won the first half title, being declared Co–Champions. McLeansboro's Clarence Kraft led the team with a .292 average and his 4 homers tied for the league lead. He also led the league with a 13–2 record as a pitcher.\nIn 1911, the team was renamed the McLeansboro Miners as the franchise continued play as members of the Kentucky-Illinois–Tennessee–League. On June 20, 1911, after compiling a 19–15 record, McLeansboro moved to Henderson, Kentucky. The move was made in part because McLeansboro did not permit Sunday baseball. The team became the Henderson Hens after the move. The McLeansboro/Henderson team ended the 1911 season with a 65–58 overall record, placing third in the Kentucky-Illinois–Tennessee–League. The managers were Miles Bradshaw and John Stelle.\nMcLeansboro, Illinois has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nThe McLeansboro teams played minor league home games at Fairgrounds Park. The ballpark was located at the Hamilton County Fairgrounds. Today, the fairgrounds are still in use as home to the Hamilton County Fair. The address is 808 West Randolph Street."

Monmouth teams played as members of the Central Interstate League in 1889, Illinois-Iowa League in 1890, Illinois-Missouri League from 1908 to 1909 and Central Association from 1910 to 1913. Monmouth won the 1909 Illinois-Missouri League championship and hosted home games at the 11th Street Park.\nHistory.\nSemi–pro and amateur baseball was popular in Monmouth, with early baseball teams playing in various leagues. In 1888, the Monmouth Athletic Association was incorporated and designed to support local baseball efforts.\nMommouth first hosted minor league baseball in 1889. Monmouth fielded a team in the 1889 Central Interstate League, consisting of Indiana, Illinois and Iowa teams. The league featured the Burlington Babies, Davenport Hawkeyes, Evansville Hoosiers, Peoria Canaries, Quincy Black Birds and Springfield Senators, who joined Monmouth in the eight–team league. The standings and statistics for 1889 are unknown.\nIn 1890 the Monmouth Maple Cities joined the new Illinois-Iowa League as a charter member. Monmouth began play along with the Aurora Hoodoos, Cedar Rapids Blackbirds, Dubuque Giants, Joliet Convicts, Ottawa Pirates, Ottumwa Coal Palaces and Sterling Blue Coats. The league did not allow Sunday games. Monmouth placed 2nd with a 64–48 record in 1890, finishing 4.5 games behind 1st place Ottumwa, playing under manager John Halpin. The Monmouth franchise folded from the league after the 1890 season and were replaced in the eight–team league by the Quincy Ravens in 1891.\nIn 1908, the Monmouth Browns were founded. The Browns joined the newly formed Class D level Illinois-Missouri League as charter members. Monmouth Mayor John S. Brown was instrumental in the forming of the Illinois–Missouri League and the Monmouth use of the \"Browns\" team moniker was in tribute to John Brown.\nThe Monmouth Browns finished with a 55–62 record to place fifth in the 1908 Illinois-Missouri League. The Browns were managed by Robert Hyde and Charles Karnell. Other charter members of the 1908 six–team league were the Canton Chinks (56–61), Galesburg Hornets (50–67), Hannibal Cannibals (68–49), Havana Perfectors (58–61) and Macomb Potters (66–53). Mommouth finished 13.0 games behind first place Hannibal in the final standings.\nThe Monmouth Browns captured the 1909 Illinois-Missouri League Championship.

        "text": "Minor League Baseball teams were based in Portsmouth, Virginia, in various seasons between 1895 and 1968. Early, Portsmouth teams, called the Portsmouth Truckers, Portsmouth Pirates and Portsmouth Browns were Virginia League members based in Portsmouth, playing between 1895 and 1928. The Portsmouth Cubs were affiliates of the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies, playing in the Class B level Piedmont League from 1935 to 1955. The team became the Portsmouth Merrimacs from 1953 to 1955.\nPortsmouth hosted the Portsmouth-Norfolk Tides from 1961 to 1968, with the franchise evolving into the Tidewater Tides and eventually today's Class AAA level Norfolk Tides.\nBaseball Hall of Fame members Pie Traynor (1920), Hack Wilson (1923) and Buck Leonard (1953) played for Portsmouth, while Jimmie Foxx (1944) and Tony Lazzeri (1942) served as managers of the Portsmouth Cubs. Actor Chuck Connors played for Portsmouth in 1942 and 1946.\nHistory.\nThe Portsmouth Truckers began play in 1935 as members of the Piedmont League, joining the Asheville Tourists, Durham Bulls, Norfolk Tars, Richmond Colts and Rocky Mount Red Sox. Portsmouth changed their moniker to \"Cubs\" in 1936. Portsmouth remained a member of the Piedmont League until the league itself folded after the 1955 season.\nEarlier, Portsmouth had played in the different incarnations of the Virginia League. The first team in Portsmouth was the Portsmouth Truckers in 1985. Portsmouth fielded teams in the Virginia League in 1895–1897, 1900–1901, 1912–1917 and 1919–1928.\nPortsmouth teams were affiliates of the Chicago Cubs from 1936 to 1938, the Philadelphia Phillies from 1939 to 1940 and the Chicago Cubs from 1941 to 1947.\nLater, Portsmouth was home of the Portsmouth-Norfolk Tides, who played in the Class A level South Atlantic League (1961–1962) and the Class A Carolina League (1963–1968). The franchise played one last season in Portsmouth when the Jacksonville Suns of the Class AAA level International League moved there in 1969. The franchise relocated permanently to neighboring Norfolk, Virginia, in 1970 to become the Tidewater Tides of the International League (1969-1992), evolving into today's Class AAA Norfolk Tides.\nBaseball Hall of Fame members Jimmie Foxx (1944) and Tony Lazzeri (1942) both managed and played briefly for Portsmouth. Hall of Famer and Negro leagues star Buck Leonard, played for Portsmouth in 1953 at age 45 (hitting .333 in 10 games) and Hall of Famers Hack Wilson (1923, hit .388 in 115 games) and Pie Traynor (1920, hit.270 in 110 games) also played for Portsmouth. Actor and 2-sport professional athlete Chuck Connors played for Portsmouth in 1942 and 1946.\nPortsmouth won the Piedmont League championship in 1945 and regular season pennants in 1943 and 1950.\nThe ballparks.\nBeginning in 1936, Portsmouth teams played at Lawrence Stadium, originally called Portsmouth Stadium, which was demolished in 1997. The stadium was named for Frank Lawrence, owner of the Portsmouth Cubs and Merrimacs. Previous teams had played exclusively at Sewanee Stadium, which was built in 1921. Piedmont still played a few games each season at Sewanee Stadium after Lawrence Stadium was constructed. Sewanee Stadium was located near the corner of Washington and Lincoln Streets in Portsmouth, Virginia. Initially, teams played at High Street Park.\nFrank Lawrence often leased Lawrence Stadium to Joe Lewis, a former Negro leagues player. Lewis would organize exhibitions with Negro league teams such the Indianapolis Clowns, Kansas City Monarchs and the Homestead Grays, with Hall of Famer Josh Gibson. Gibson once hit a home run at Lawrence Stadium that was said to have cleared the football press box and landed on Glasgow Street, traveling an estimated 585 feet. Gibson's Grays teammate, Hall of Famer Buck Leonard, later played for Portsmouth."

He was previously a player development coach for the Oklahoma City Thunder and the New York Knicks, an assistant coach for the German senior men's national team, a graduate assistant for Virginia Commonwealth University, and a volunteer assistant for the University of Georgia.\nEarly life and college career.\nBliss attended Wausau West (Wis.) High School, where he was a standout basketball player and the valedictorian of the class of 2004. He was a lightly recruited two star prospect, but earned a scholarship offer to play at the University of Georgia. Bliss was a four year starter and three year team captain for the Bulldogs. He was named Co-MVP of the 07-08 team that won the SEC tournament championship and participated in the NCAA tournament. That same year, he was awarded SEC scholar athlete of the year and won the Dick Copas Leadership Award, an award given to one male student at Georgia who demonstrates exceptional leadership and commitment to his program.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing his senior season at Georgia, Bliss became a volunteer assistant for then-head coach Dennis Felton. The next season, Bliss joined the Virginia Commonwealth staff with former Georgia assistant, Mike Jones. The head coach of VCU, Shaka Smart, was intrigued by Bliss' former playing style and unusual size that he could bring to his coaching staff stating, “I remembered Dave was a really cerebral player. Also, you don't get a lot of coaching candidates that are that size.\" Throughout the season NBA scouts watched VCU's star player, Larry Sanders, an eventual 1st round draft pick. Current Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti was one of the executives that followed Sanders that season. While scouting Sanders, Presti became impressed with Bliss' abilities. Following VCU's season, Presti hired Bliss as a video analyst and player development assistant. Bliss stayed with the Thunder as a video analyst and player development coach from 2010-2015. His time with the Thunder included one trip to the NBA Finals and two trips to the Western Conference Finals. Bliss' next stop was with the New York Knicks. As a player development coach, he prepared opposing team scouting reports, led drill work for players during practice and game days, and oversaw summer development activities for players. During the 2016 and 2017 NBA offseason, Bliss served as an assistant coach for the German senior men's national team. In 2018, he rejoined the Thunder as a senior player development coach. After one season in the role, Bliss was promoted to assistant coach on the Thunder staff. Bliss was the head coach for the Thunder at the 2019 NBA Summer League. In November of 2021, Bliss served as the Thunder's interim head coach for a three game road trip due to Thunder head coach, Mark Daigneault, tending to the birth of his child. "

        "title": "Korean Basketball League draft",
        "text": "The Korean Basketball League rookie draft (Korean: 한국프로농구 신인드래프트) is an annual event that allows teams to take turns selecting amateur basketball players and other eligible players. Eligible players attend a series of try-outs organized by the KBL roughly analogous to the NFL Scouting Combine and NBA Draft Combine, where they have their height, arm span and other measurements taken. Their predicted draft rankings are not based solely on their performances during the try-outs as players are evaluated much earlier from their performances during the U-League season, at high school tournaments or in the senior national team.\nEligibility.\nOnly South Korean citizens (FIBA-registered nationality) are eligible to be drafted. Foreign players are drafted separately due to an existing foreign player quota while foreign players who have a Korean parent but hold a foreign nationality may be drafted through the ethnic draft and not be counted as a foreign player.\nThe applicant must first be registered with the Korean Basketball Association as an \"amateur\" in order to be eligible for the draft. Regardless of background, all applicants must apply through a \"general public draft\" (Korean: 일반인 드래프트). Generally, there are two categories of applicants:\nAll players go through a try-out and have their height, weight and arm span measurements taken. Players from the first category are then automatically added to the KBL's rookie list while players from the second category must pass another try-out which includes playing in a series of 3x3 and 5x5 games, with KBL scouts and coaches in attendance. Their names are then added to the rookie list if nominated.\nVenue.\nFrom its inception until 2012, the draft took place in a hotel convention room or exhibition hall. Since 2013, it has taken place at the Jamsil Students' Gymnasium in Seoul. Prior to COVID-19, family members and selected guests, mainly the candidates' college teammates or coaches, were allowed to attend.\nHistory.\nThe KBL rookie draft initially took place in January or February as it was the end of the academic year and all draft prospects were college seniors. An issue which arose from the timing of the draft was the fact that rookies only joined their teams towards the end of the KBL season, which runs from October to March the following year. They had little time gel with their new teammates or acclimatize to the professional game.\nBeginning with 2012, the draft was scheduled in October or November, at the conclusion of the U-League season. Players from college teams will finish the season and declare eligibility for the upcoming draft before participating in the try-outs. They would generally join their new teams during the second round of the season. The timing of the draft day posed a \"sink or swim\" scenario for rookies as they had little time to familiarize themselves with their new teammates and coaches: rookies who are able to adapt to the professional league quickly enough are integrated into the main team by the end of the season while those unable to do so spend most of the season in the D-League (reserves).\nThe 2021 draft was moved back a month to September due to the abbreviated U-League season. The move was met with positive responses from players and teams as it allowed rookies to join pre-season training with their new teams.\nSince the 2014 draft, there has been an increase in high school seniors and college freshmen, sophomores and juniors being picked earlier. Cha Min-seok was the first high school senior to be picked first overall. Yonsei University sophomore Lee Won-seok, first overall pick of the 2021 draft, was the first to have not been a college senior.\nNotable drafts.\nKorean-language basketball magazine \"Rookie\" and newspaper \"Sports Dong-a\" have both retrospectively dubbed the 2007 draft as the \"Golden Draft\". Compared to past and present draft classes, as of the 2020–21 season, more players from this draft have won the KBL Championship and continued to play regularly in their respective teams into their mid-thirties. The draft produced two KBL Most Valuable Player Award winners, statistical leaders and several \"one club men\" who spent entire decade-long careers with their original teams.\nOther notable draft years include 2008, 2011 and 2014. Although not on the level of the 2007, the aforementioned drafts are viewed as \"high-level\" due to the larger numbers of first round draftees who have gone on to establish themselves as first-option players for their respective teams, won individual awards and called-up to the national team for international tournaments.\nThe 2017 draft was initially derided as a \"worst ever\" draft as only several players stood out from their performances in the U-League. It has since been retrospectively re-evaluated as a \"high-level\" draft as half of the first round picks have gone on to establish themselves in their teams and been selected for the national team."

The season saw the Polish player won two WTA singles titles and reached a career-high world number 4.\nSeason summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nŚwiątek advanced to the quarterfinals at the Gippsland Trophy to start her season, where she was defeated by Ekaterina Alexandrova in straight sets. At the Australian Open, her performance was marred by a significant number of unforced errors, leading to her fourth-round loss to Simona Halep in three sets. In the Adelaide International, Świątek clinched her first title of the year without losing a set. This achievement allowed her to ascend into the top 15 in the singles rankings. However, during the Miami Open, Świątek was ousted in the third round by Ana Konjuh in a three-set encounter.\nClay season.\nŚwiątek's next tournament was the Madrid Open, where she made her tournament debut. She reached the third round and lost to the world no. 1 Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. She then won her second title of the year at the Italian Open, defeating former champion Karolína Plíšková in just 46 minutes by sending a double-bagel. The title also saw her move into the top 10 on 17 May 2021, as world no. 9.\nŚwiątek failed to defend her French Open singles title, but she did reach the quarterfinals, where she lost to Maria Sakkari in straight sets.

        "text": "Many of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) schools developed club teams over the years, and eventually varsity hockey programs at the Division III level of the NCAA. Most of these varsity teams were established in the late 1990s. After Title IX gave equal access to women's sports, the MIAC, being one of the oldest conferences in the NCAA, finally had enough programs to offer women's ice hockey as a conference starting with the 1998–99 season. Six member programs began play at the time.\nHistory.\nIn the 1998–99 season, the conference held a postseason tournament named the Augsburg invitational. This served as the first unofficial MIAC Championship.\nIn the 1999–00 season, the official MIAC women's ice hockey tournament was established to determine the postseason conference champion. With two more schools joining the MIAC, the top four teams qualified, with the higher seed hosting a two-game aggregate. The winner, would advance to the AWCHA Division III ice hockey championship to play a best-of-three series for the national championship. This was prior to the NCAA sponsoring Division III women's ice hockey.\nIn the 2001–02 season, the NCAA established a Division III Women's Ice Hockey Championship, of which the MIAC tournament champion received an automatic bid. The MIAC, now at ten teams, added a fifth team to their conference tournament. The new play-in game featured the 4th place team hosting the 5th place team, with the winner playing the #1 seed. The conference also eliminated the two-game aggregate model, moving towards a more traditional single-elimination style tournament. In the 2002 tournament, the semifinals and championship were held at a neutral site. The next season, in 2003, the entire tournament was held at a neutral site. From that point on, the MIAC tournament went back to the higher seed hosting through all rounds. This format stayed the same for years, with the only temporary adjustments coming because of the COVID-19 pandemic. After the 2020-21 tournament was cancelled due to the pandemic, the 2021-22 tournament was modified so that all ten teams qualified for the conference tournament. This was done so to allow all players the chance to play additional games after a few COVID cancellations bled into the 2021–22 season. This gave the top six teams in the standings a bye in a traditional ten-team bracket with no reseeding.\nFor the 2022-23 season, it was announced that the women's tournament would return to the traditional five-team field."

        "text": "Bill Mazeroski's 1960 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series on October 13, 1960, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Leading off the bottom of ninth, in a 9–9 tie and with the count one ball, zero strikes, Mazeroski hit a line drive toward deep left field that cleared the wall for a solo home run. Mazeroski homered off of New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to end the Series, giving the Pirates a 10–9 win and their first championship since 1925. It was the first of two times the World Series has ended on a walk-off home run, and the only time it has happened in Game 7. The second and most recent World Series-winning walk-off homer was hit by Joe Carter for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, although it occurred in Game 6.\nBackground.\nOn the heels of a subpar season for Mazeroski and his fourth-place team, the 1960 campaign exceeded the wildest dreams of Pittsburgh sports fans. The Battlin' Bucs as they would become known dominated the National League virtually from the start to claim their first pennant since the 1927 season. Meanwhile, Mazeroski was an NL starter in both All-Star Games.\nThe Pirates seized control of the pennant race in August, when they won 21 of 31 games with Mazeroski in a lead role. He hit .373, drove in 16 runs and had a 26-game errorless streak in the month. The 95-59 Pirates finished seven games ahead of second place Milwaukee for the NL pennant. The team was rewarded with a trip to the 1960 World Series, where the second baseman forged his legacy against the New York Yankees with a pair of game-winning home runs. The 1960 Pirates team featured eight All-Stars, but was widely predicted to lose the World Series to a powerful New York Yankees team.\nBefore their 1960 season, the Yankees made a trade with the Kansas City Athletics in which they acquired outfielder Roger Maris. In his first Yankees season, Maris hit a single, double, and two home runs in his first game as a Yankee. He was named to the AL All-Star roster again and played in both games. He finished the season leading the AL in slugging percentage (.581), runs batted in (112), and extra base hits (64). He also hit 39 home runs and had a .283 batting average. He won the American League's Most Valuable Player award and was recognized as an outstanding defensive outfielder with a Gold Glove Award. The Yankees won the American League pennant, the first of five consecutive pennants\nThe New York Yankees headed into the World Series with a 15-game winning streak, the 8th longest streak in the American League this century, after Dale Long's two-run 9th-inning home run gave them an 8–7 win over the Boston Red Sox. The 193 home runs are an AL season record, three better than the 1956 Yankees. RBI leader Roger Maris drove in three runs, but fell one home run short of Mickey Mantle's league-high 40.\nThe 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 12 years under Casey Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55–27 in the seven World Series games.\nPostseason.\nYankees manager Casey Stengel picked Art Ditmar, who had won the most games, 15, to start for the Yankees, rather than the established star, Whitey Ford. The Pirates knocked Ditmar out of the game in the first inning. In a portent of things to come, Bill Mazeroski's two-run 5th-inning home run off Jim Coates was the difference as Pittsburgh beat the Yankees 6–4 in its first World Series win since 1925. Roy Face survived a two-run 9th-inning Elston Howard home run to preserve Vern Law's victory.\nIn Game 2, Mickey Mantle hit two home runs in a Yankees 16–3 victory at Forbes Field, evening the World Series. A seven-run 6th inning overwhelmed Pittsburgh.\nAt Yankee Stadium for Game 3, Bobby Richardson collected six RBI, including a grand slam off reliever Clem Labine in a six-run first inning, and Whitey Ford pitched a four-hitter 10–0 shutout to give the Yankees a 2–1 World Series lead, spoiling Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh's 43rd birthday.\nVern Law won again in Game 4, thanks to his own RBI single and Bill Virdon's two-run hit. Roy Face retired the final eight batters in order. The Pittsburgh Pirates' 3–2 win evened the 1960 World Series.\nIn Game 5, Bill Mazeroski starred again. His two-run double to left field off Art Ditmar scored Don Hoak and Gino Cimoli. This staked Harvey Haddix to a 3–0 lead in the fourth inning. Roy Face was called on once more for another hitless effort to preserve a 5–2 win over the Yankees and 3–2 World Series lead for the surprising Pirates.\nIn Game 6, Whitey Ford preserved the Yankees' hopes with a seven-hit shutout at Forbes Field. Bob Friend was bombed again as the Yankees coast 12–0. Bobby Richardson's two run-scoring triples gave him a World Series record of 12 RBI. Of Pittsburgh's three losses, Friend was on the hook for two, racking up a 13.50 ERA over his three appearances.\nThe Yankees outscored Pittsburgh 55–27, and administered three thrashings (16–3, 10–0 and 12–0), but the resilient Pirates took the other four contests by a run differential of only +7 (6–4, 3–2, 5–2 and 10–9).\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 7.\nThe drama of Mazeroski's home run was heightened by the excitement that preceded the home run: A combined total of seven runs were scored by both teams in a wild and wacky bottom of the eighth and top of the ninth. An oddity in this game – it is the only World Series game this century with no strikeouts recorded.\nDick Groat had an RBI single and scored in the eighth inning, in which the Pirates scored five runs to take a 9–7 lead.\nGil McDougald entered the game as a pinch runner in the top of the ninth, he scored on Yogi Berra's ground ball to tie the game at 9–9.\nAfter winning Game 5 as a starter, Harvey Haddix relieved late in Game 7 and was credited with the win when Mazeroski hit his Series-ending famous walk-off home run. Haddix went 2–0 in the 1960 Series, with a 2.45 ERA.\nThe infield developed a \"rock-hard\" surface throughout the Forbes Field's history. During the final game of the 1960 World Series, Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek was struck in the neck with a ball that bounced off the hard dirt surface. This broke up a potentially rally-killing double play and caused Kubek to exit the game during the eighth inning. Bill Virdon ultimately reached first base on the infield single. This started a rally for the Pirates.\nPirates catcher Hal Smith helped set the stage for Mazeroski's dramatic home run one inning earlier, when he capped off a Pirates rally with a pivotal three-run home run of his own. Smith's home run put the Pirates ahead 9–7, but its true value was realized when the Yankees scored two runs in the top of the ninth inning to tie the score. Thus, instead of Mazeroski coming to bat in the bottom of the ninth with the score 9–6 in favor of the Yankees, the game was tied with the winning run (in the form of Mazeroski) at the plate.\nThe play.\nOne of the greatest games in baseball history got wilder yet in the top of the ninth inning, when the Yankees plated two runs to forge a 9-9 deadlock. At that point, Mazeroski admittedly got caught up in the sudden turn of events. It seemed the second baseman had forgotten that he was to lead off the bottom half of the inning, and it wasn't until first base coach Lenny Levy reminded him that he hurriedly picked up a bat.\nJohnny Blanchard was the catcher who called the pitch. At precisely 3:36 p.m. local time, on a 1-0 count, Mazeroski slammed Terry's high fastball just to the left of the 406-foot marker in distant left-center field. Mazeroski excitedly finished his sprint around the bases before he was mobbed at home plate. \"You know, all I could think about was, \"We beat the Yankeesǃ We beat themǃ We beat the damn Yankeesǃ\" he said.\nFourteen-year-old schoolboy Andy Jerpe retrieved the ball amid the cherry trees in Schenley Park, which was adjacent to the ballpark. Jerpe just happened to be strolling by the ballpark when he retrieved the ball, and it wasn't until he showed it to a police officer patrolling the ballpark gates that both realized what Jerpe had. Jerpe offered the ball to Mazeroski in the clubhouse, but Mazeroski let him keep it, saying, \"The memory's good enough for me.\" Mazeroski signed the ball for Jerpe, but the keepsake was lost during a neighborhood game a short time later.\nEven though Mazeroski hit .320 with team highs of five RBI, four runs scored and two home runs, Yankees counterpart Bobby Richardson was selected the Most Valuable Player of the series. Coincidentally, Mazeroski, who wore #9 for the Pirates, came to bat in the bottom of the 9th inning with the score tied 9-9.\nThe calls.\nChuck Thompson, the play-by-play announcer for NBC Radio,(Audio) is particularly remembered for his flawed but endearing call of the homer. The event was replayed in full on an MLB radio special some years ago, during one of the players' strikes. The pitcher was actually Ralph Terry; Art Ditmar was warming up in the bullpen, and besides that error as well as relaying the final score incorrectly at first, Thompson just got caught up in the moment:\nWell, a little while ago, when we mentioned that this one, in typical fashion, was going right to the wire, little did we know … Art Ditmar throws ... here's a swing and a high fly ball going deep to left, this may do it! … Back to the wall goes Berra, it is … over the fence, home run, the Pirates win! … (long pause for crowd noise) … Ladies and gentlemen, Mazeroski has hit a one-nothing pitch over the left field fence at Forbes Field to win the 1960 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates by a score of ten to nothing! … Once again, that final score … The Pittsburgh Pirates, the 1960 world champions, defeat the New York Yankees. The Pirates ten, and the Yankees NINE! ... and Forbes Field ... is an insane asylum!\nIn 1985, Thompson's Ditmar-Terry flub became a commercial hit, featured as an audio-over in a nostalgia-immersed Budweiser TV ad during that year's World Series. A libel lawsuit subsequently filed by Ditmar against Anheuser-Busch and its advertising agency for the commercial was ultimately rejected by a United States District Court.\nAftermath.\nThe 1960 Pirates were the only team between 1945 and 2001 to have not succumbed to the so-called \"Ex-Cubs Factor\" in the postseason. They also became the first team to win a World Series on a home run, a feat later achieved by the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, although Joe Carter's home run came in Game 6 of the 1993 Series. Mazeroski's homer remains the only walk-off home run in Game 7 of a World Series.\nAfter Forbes Field was demolished, the section of the left-field wall where the home run left the park was moved to the Pirates' new home of Three Rivers Stadium, and still later was moved to their current home, PNC Park. A line of bricks marks that section of the wall, next to a preserved wall section, and a plaque indicating the spot where Mazeroski's homer left the park is embedded in the current sidewalk.\nThe portion of the left field wall over which Bill Mazeroski hit his walk-off home run to end the 1960 World Series, between the scoreboard and the \"406 FT\" sign, no longer stands at its original location. A portion of that wall, including the distance marker, had been sliced off and moved to the Allegheny Club at Three Rivers Stadium. Before the Three Rivers demolition, the section of the wall was salvaged, and in 2009 it was restored and placed on the Riverwalk outside of PNC Park.\nMeanwhile, the original location of that wall is outlined by bricks extending from the left-center field wall across Roberto Clemente Drive and into the sidewalk. A plaque embedded in the sidewalk marks the spot where Mazeroski's home run cleared the wall. The left-center and center field brick wall with \"457 FT\" and \"436 FT\" painted on it still stands at its original location, along with the stadium's flagpole, adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh's Mervis and Posvar Halls. Despite not technically being the correct section of wall where Mazeroski's famous home run cleared, it is often locally referred to as \"Mazeroski's Wall.\" This portion of the wall remained after Forbes Field was torn down, and was refurbished in 2006 in time for the All-Star Game hosted in Pittsburgh. In addition, a wooden replica of an entrance to the stadium, including a ticket window and players entrance, was constructed and placed near the remaining wall in 2006. The home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall. However, its location has been altered; author John McCollister wrote, \"Had architects placed home plate in its precise spot about half of the Pirates fans could not view it. The reason: it would have to be on display in the fifth stall of the ladies' restroom.\" However, the original location of the home plate has been more recently determined by others to be approximately away from its current display, just inside the GSPIA/Economics Library, and not in a restroom as has been popularly believed.\nA ceremony is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland to listen to a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone at the base of the flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600 people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.\nIn September 2010, a statue of Mazeroski was unveiled outside PNC Park, depicting his legendary home run celebration — a runner pose with both arms extended, ball cap in right hand."

        "title": "2001–02 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2001–02 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 81st season of play for the program. They represent the University of Minnesota in the 2001–02 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 43rd season in Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The Golden Gophers were coached by Don Lucia, in his 3rd season, and played their home games at the Mariucci Arena.\nSeason.\nFast start.\nMinnesota entered the season with the highest expectations since the mid-90s, being ranked in the top-5 in both preseason polls. The team lived up to its billing and then some from the start when they downed defending finalist and #2 North Dakota and then went on a long unbeaten streak. In the game starting goaltender Adam Hauser faltered in the first and was replaced by freshman Travis Weber. Houser regained the starting role after a strong performance the following week and cemented his position when he relieved Weber after the young netminder allowed 4 goals in the first period against Michigan Tech. While the goalies were sorting themselves out, the Golden Gophers' offense was overpowering in their first 13 games. Minnesota scored no fewer than 4 goals a night and averaging 6 goals a game. The scoring was led by Jeff Taffe and Jordan Leopold but was spread across the lineup with all four lines contributing to the team's success.\nHiccup.\nMinnesota rode its stellar record to the #1 seed and held it until early December. The offense cooled off a bit against St. Cloud State and the Gophers lost their top ranking as a result. The team split a road series at Denver to head into then holiday break but recovered a bit by winning the Mariucci Classic. Despite winning the tournament, Minnesota dropped another spot in the rankings and slowly slipped down to #5 by failing to sweep any of the succeeding 5 weekends. During this time, the team began rotating the starting job in goal between Hauser and Weber with mixed results.\nReturning to form.\nThe Gopher offense finally regained its footing in early February and remained consistent for most of the rest of the season. The result was Minnesota going 7–1 down the stretch to finish strong. Unfortunately, the mid-season stumble cost the team a chance at a regular season title and the Golden Gophers finished 3rd in the WCHA. In the final month of the season, Hauser regain the starting role with a string of solid performances and led the team into the postseason as the #3 team.\nWCHA Tournament.\nIn spite of a scare in the second game against North Dakota, Minnesota continued their hot streak. They overpowered St. Cloud State in the semifinal to reach their first championship game since 1997. While the Gophers outshout Denver 40–27, they were stymied by a masterful performance by Wade Dubielewicz and fell 2–5.\nNCAA tournament.\nThough disappointed at the runner-up finish, Minnesota did receive the second western seed for the NCAA Tournament and were advanced into the second round. Their first game came against conference-rival Colorado College. The Tigers got on the board first, but the Gophers got the next three goals. CC closed the gap just after the mid-point of the game but the defense closed ranks and limited the opportunities on their goal for the remainder of the match. Early in the 3rd, Barry Tallackson took a hooking call, giving Colorado College a man-advantage, but it was Minnesota's John Pohl who scored during the ensuing power play. Several more penalties were called before the end of the match, but a pair of cross-checking infractions from Alex Kim put CC at a disadvantage for most of the final four minutes and helped usher the Gophers to their first postseason victory in 5 years.\nThe national semifinal against Michigan wasn't any more sedate and Minnesota had to kill off six separate penalties during the game. They managed to do so and progressively built a 3–0 lead early in the third. The Wolverines would not quit, however, and scored twice to pull within a goal with 90 seconds remaining. With Minnesota playing a defensive shell, they managed to hold off Michigan and still had the lead when the buzzer sounded.\nNational championship.\nIn Minnesota's first championship appearance in over a decade, they met Maine and the two fought a back-and-forth battle for the title. Minnesota got on the board in the first period on the strength of the power play goal from Keith Ballard. They held the lead for a time but couldn't extend their advantage despite three succeeding penalties by Maine. Instead, it was the Black bears who netted a power play marker early in the second frame. John Pohl wasted no time and scored to give Minnesota the lead just 51 seconds later. The Gophers continued to hold a 1-goal advantage for the rest of the period on the strength of Hauser's play. Maine tied the game a second time, just 77 seconds into the third, and continued to fire the puck on goal until a they got their first lead of the game with under 5 minutes to play. Minnesota tried to tie the game for a fourth time but the clock was quickly counting down. After an icing, head coach Don Lucia called a timeout with 58 seconds remaining and drew up a play for the team. The ensuing drew turned to a melee but the puck found its way to Matt Koalska, who shot it between Matthew Yeats' legs to the delight of the partisan crowd. Both teams had several opportunities to score in the ensuing overtime, but Minnesota got the biggest break when Maine took a tripping penalty with just over 4 minutes remaining. A minute later, Grant Potulny collected the second rebound after shots by Leopold and Pohl and fired the puck into the cage, winning the 4th national title for the program.\nThis was the 4th national championship team consisted entirely of American players (1949 Boston College, 1976 Minnesota, 1979 Minnesota).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862334; \" | "

        "text": "Vancouver, Washington hosted minor league baseball teams in the 1904 and 1918 seasons. Vancouver teams played as members of the 1904 Class D level Oregon State League and the 1918 Class B level Pacific Coast International League.\nBaseball Hall of Fame member Joe McGinnity played for the 1918 Vancouver Beavers.\nHistory.\n1904 Oregon State League.\nMinor league baseball began in Vancouver, Washington with the 1904 Vancouver Soldiers, who began play as charter members of the four–team Class D level Oregon State League, before the franchise was forced to relocate during the season. The Oregon State League began play, with Vancouver joining the teams from Eugene, Oregon (Eugene Blues), Roseburg, Oregon (Roseburg Shamrocks) and Salem, Oregon (Salem Raglans) in the four–team league. Some sources erroneously have the Vancouver Soldiers franchise based in Vancouver, Canada.\nOn May 18, 1904, the Vancouver Soldiers, with a 3–8 record, moved from Vancouver, Washington to Albany, Oregon. The team then continued play as the Albany Rollers. The move was necessary because the Oregon State League was not admitted to the National Association governing body until the league vacated the Vancouver, Washington franchise. The National Association determined that the Vancouver franchise was infringing on another minor league team, as Vancouver was deemed to be in the regional territory of the Portland Browns of the Pacific Coast League.\nAfter the Vancouver franchise relocated to Albany, the Oregon State League permanently folded on July 6, 1904. The league folded after both the Eugene and Roseburg franchises folded on July 6. After compiling a 14–16 record while based in Albany, the Vancouver/Albany team finished the season in 3rd place with a 17–24 overall record. Playing under managers Fred Gregory and E.P. Preble, the Vancouver/Albany team finished 9.5 games behind the first place Salem Raglans in the final Oregon State League Standings.\n1918 Pacific Coast International League.\nMinor league baseball returned to Vancouver, Washington in 1918. The 1918 Vancouver Beavers joined as charter members of the Pacific Coast International League, during the season. The Pacific International League had formed as a six–team Class B level league, evolving from the 1917 Northwestern League. After the season had begun, the Vancouver, British Columbia franchise relocated to Vancouver, Washington. On June 25, 1918, the Vancouver, British Columbia based Vancouver Beavers moved to Vancouver, Washington with a 26–28 record, keeping the team \"Beavers\" moniker. Previously, the Tacoma Tigers and Spokane Indians franchises had folded on May 26, 1918, leaving the league with four teams.\nVancouver, B.C. owner Robert Brown had disagreements over the travel costs of the league and had sought to change the league schedule, offering teams money to play their home games in Vancouver B.C. The Pacific Coast International League stripped the team from Brown and relocated the franchise, despite the team drawing well in Vancouver B.C.\nShortly after the Vancouver, Washington franchise began play, the Pacific Coast International League folded. On July 7, 1918, the Vancouver franchise had an 0–11 record after the relocation at the time the league folded. The combined Vancouver teams finished the 1918 season with an overall record of 26–39 to finish in fourth place. Playing under managers Robert Brown and James A. Hamilton in the two locations, the team finished 16.0 games behind the first place Seattle Giants in the final standings. The continuation of World War I, the Spanish flu pandemic, as well as local factory work times all contributed to the demise of the 1918 league. The league reformed in 1919 as the Northwest International League with a Vancouver B.C franchise, but without a Vancouver, Washington franchise.\nBaseball Hall of Fame member Joe McGinnity played for the 1918 Vancouver Beavers, compiling a 2–7 record with a 3.30 ERA at age 47.\nVancouver, Washington has not hosted another minor league team.\nIn 2011, talks took place to relocate the Class A level Yakima Bears franchise to Vancouver, Washington. The Yakima Bears franchise eventually relocated to Oregon and became the Hillsboro Hops.\nThe ballpark.\nThe name of the home ballpark for Vancouver minor league teams is unknown.\nNotable alumni.\nBaseball Hall of Fame alumni.\nJoe McGinnity (1918)"

There are 12 NPB teams, split evenly between the Central League and Pacific League.\nOn April 10, Chiba Lotte Marines pitcher Rōki Sasaki threw a perfect game, the first in 28 years and the 16th in NPB history. Sasaki tied an existing NPB record by striking out 19 batters, and set a new record by striking out 13 consecutive batters.\nIncluding Sasaki's perfect game, for the first time since 1940, there were five no-hitters this season, with Nao Higashihama of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks throwing one on May 11 against the Saitama Seibu Lions, Shōta Imanaga of the Yokohama DeNA BayStars doing so on June 7 during interleague play against the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (also being the first no hitter in the history of the Sapporo Dome in its final season as the home of the Fighters), and Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Orix Buffaloes throwing one also against the Lions on June 18. One was nearly thrown on July 20, with rookie Ren Mukunoki of the Buffaloes nearly doing so against the Fighters, but he fell 1 strike short, as he gave up a hit to Fighters infielder Ryusei Satoh, in which fans called as a similar incident to former MLB pitcher Dave Stieb, in which he lost a perfect game and a no hitter in the same game with only 1 strike to go. A 5th one would eventually be thrown on August 27 by Cody Ponce of the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, in just his 2nd start, tying 2022 with 1940 with the most no-hitters in a season in Japanese pro baseball history, as well as becoming the first foreign player since Rick Guttormson of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in 2006 to throw a no-hitter, and the first Pacific League foreign player to do so since the now late Narciso Elvira did so with the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes in 2000.\nThe Tokyo Yakult Swallows took home the Central League pennant for the second year in a row over the Yokohama DeNA BayStars while the Orix Buffaloes took the Pacific League pennant over the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks via the first pennant tiebreaker in NPB history.\nClimax Series.\nFinal Stage.\nThe series started with a 1–0 advantage for the first-placed team.

The Bruins were led by fourth-year head coach Mick Cronin, and they played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members of the Pac-12 Conference. Guard/forward Jaime Jaquez Jr. was named a second-team All-American. He was voted the Pac-12 Player of the Year, and received first-team All-Pac-12 honors along with guard Tyger Campbell. Guard Jaylen Clark was named to the second team and was voted the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year. He was placed on the conference's all-defensive team along with forward Adem Bona, who was named the Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. Amari Bailey joined Bona on the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team, and Cronin was voted the Pac-12 Coach of the Year.\nUCLA lost five players who were major contributors from their previous year's squad that went 27–8. However, the Bruins were also the only team in the power conferences whose roster consisted entirely of players who began their college careers at that school. With a 60–56 win over Colorado on February 26, 2023, the Bruins clinched their first Pac-12 regular season championship since 2012–13. UCLA ended the regular season with an 82–73 win over No. 8 Arizona, extending their home winning streak to 25 games, the longest active streak in the nation. They won the conference by four games and finished the season undefeated at home for the first time since 2006–07. Clark left the game with a lower leg injury, and was ruled out for the Pac-12 tournament. The top-seeded Bruins advanced to the tournament finals before losing 61–59 to No. 2-seed Arizona, ending their 12-game winning streak. UCLA played without its top two defenders, as Bona also missed the game with an injured left shoulder, which he suffered in the semifinals against Oregon.\nThe Bruins, who were vying for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, received a No. 2 seed in the West Region. It was their highest seeding since they were placed No. 1 in 2008. However, Clark was ruled out for the season. Bona was cleared to return in their opener, but he did not play in the 86–53 rout over No. 15-seed UNC Asheville. He played in the second round against Northwestern, which UCLA won to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the third straight season. The Bruins were eliminated 79–76 by third-seeded Gonzaga. UCLA led by 13 points at halftime, but were down by 10 in the second half with 2:40 remaining. They outscored the Bulldogs 14–3, culminating with a three-point field goal by Bailey to take a one-point lead. However, Gonzaga's Julian Strawther made a basket with six seconds remaining, and they held on for the win. Bona sat out the game due to his shoulder. The game was rematch of the schools' Final Four matchup from 2021, also won by the Bulldogs, on a buzzer beater by Jalen Suggs to end the game. It was the Bruins' third consecutive loss to the Bulldogs in as many seasons.\nOffseason.\nDepartures.\nSource:\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| \n!colspan=12 style=| \nSource:"

        "text": "An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2022 NCAA Women's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), and the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) for the 2021–22 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. Both AP and USBWA choose three teams, while WBCA lists 10 honorees.\nA consensus All-America team in women's basketball has never been organized. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by AP, USBWA, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), and \"Sporting News\" to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus All-America men's basketball team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. \"Sporting News\" does not select an All-America team in women's basketball.\nBy selector.\nAssociated Press (AP).\nAnnounced on March 16, 2022; listed in order of votes received. Of note:\nUnited States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).\nThe USBWA announced its 15-member team, divided into first, second, and third teams, plus honorable mention selections, on March 17, 2022.

Due to a tie for the fifth spot on the second team, the overall team had 16 members instead of the usual 15.\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 10, 2022.

He is perhaps best known for selling a then-19-year-old Willie Mays to the New York Giants.\nEarly life.\nHayes was born on November 20, 1902, in Memphis, Tennessee, the son of Thomas and Florence Hayes. Thomas Sr. worked as an undertaker and his T.H. Hayes &amp; Sons Funeral Home would become the oldest Black-owned business in Memphis.\nAfter attending Atlanta University, Lincoln University and the University of Illinois, Hayes returned to Memphis to help run the family funeral home by the mid-1920s. In 1929, he married Helen Meadow. Hayes was involved in multiple other business ventures in Memphis, including insurance, hotels, restaurants and nightclubs. In 1933, Hayes co-founded the Union Protective Life Insurance Company, serving as vice-president until it was sold to Universal Life Insurance Co. in 1980.\nBaseball career.\nHayes purchased the Birmingham Black Barons of the Negro American League in December 1939 after the previous owners failed to field a club that year. He also served as vice president of the Negro American League.\nWhile owner of the Black Barons, he began a partnership with Abe Saperstein, who oversaw the clubs promotions and venue booking while Hayes retained ownership and handled player signings and negotiations. During his ownership, the Black Barons won Negro American League pennants in 1943, 1944 and 1948.\nIn early 1949, Hayes sold Willie Mays, at the time 19-years-old, to the New York Giants for $10,000. Hayes reportedly gave Mays a $6,000 cut of the sale. Hayes had originally signed Mays the previous year from the Birmingham Industrial League.\nBy January 1952, the Black Barons had fallen into financial difficulty, with Hayes ultimately selling the club to Baltimore Elite Giants owner William Sousa Bridgeforth in February 1952."

        "text": "The 2022 Season was the Athletes Unlimited Basketball's first in existence. The season was played in Las Vegas and ran from January 26 to February 26. The format in which teams are redrafted each week allows athletes to accumulate points for both individual and team performances, culminating with one individual winner.\nTianna Hawkins became the inaugural Overall Season Winner - finishing with 6,836 points. She also led in many statistical categories. She led the league in rebounds (166) and ranked second in points (357), and owns single-game records for points (43), leaderboard points (790) and field goals (19).\nScoring system.\nThere are multiple ways for players to accumulate points during games to make their way into 1 of the 4 captain spots.\nWin Points.\nWin points are all about the team performance. They accumulate during both individual quarters and overall game wins. Each quarter is worth +50 points and overall games are worth +100 points.\nIf a quarter is tied, the points roll over to the subsequent quarter.\nGame MVPs.\nAfter each game, the players and members of The Unlimited Club will vote for players who they feel had standout performances.\nThese points will be added to the player's individual total. Points will be awarded as follows:\nIndividual Stats.\nThe final component of points is individual stats. Players will earn points based on their performance:\nPlayers can also lose points for certain actions, such as committing fouls, turning over the ball or missing a shot:\nCaptains.\nEach week, based on the point system, the top 4 players will draft their teams. They will draft in a snake style system.\nLeaderboard.\nBelow is the leaderboard which tallies the total points earned via the scoring system that each player has accumulated during the games that are played each week. The points are on a running-tally from week to week. \nThe list reflects the final standings - culminating after Week 5."

        "text": "The 2020 ITU World Triathlon Series was the 12th season of the World Triathlon Series, the top level international series for triathlon since its establishment in 2009. The season was originally scheduled to consist of seven pairs of triathlon races for both a men’s and women’s competition, as well as three mixed relays, beginning on March 7 in Abu Dhabi and concluding August 22nd with the Grand Final in Edmonton. Other notable events on the calendar included the Mixed Relay Olympic Qualifier in Chengdu on May 10 and the 2020 Summer Olympics, with the men’s and women’s individual events taking place on July 27 and 28th and the mixed relay event taking place on August 1.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were several changes to the calendar, including the cancellation of multiple events and postponement of the 2020 Olympics. As a result, ITU made the decision to award World Championship titles at the last remaining event of the 2020 series, set to be held in Hamburg on September 5, 2020. Vincent Luis and Katie Zaferes entered the race as the defending champions from the 2019 Season. Luis would go on to defend his title, with Georgia Taylor-Brown winning the World Championship for the first time in her career.\nOverview.\nCalendar.\nThe 2020 ITU World Triathlon Series was planned to visit eight cities, including Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic.\nDue to the growing uncertainty of COVID-19, ITU announced on February 26 that the Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event, which was originally set to be held in Chengdu, would be moved to Valencia. 3 days later, ITU postponed the World Triathlon events in Abu Dhabi indefinitely, with hopes of finding a new date in late March or April.\nOn March 14, 2020, ITU made the decision to suspend all activities until April 30, thus suspending all competitions, courses, camps and other events. All World and Olympic Qualification Rankings were frozen effective March 16th. In the official announcement, ITU president Marisol Casado stated: This is a decision that is hard to take, and you can have my word that we are taking it with the health and safety of athletes, coaches, officials, facilitators, staff, volunteers and spectators, all the triathlon family, as the top priority. We are taking this decision convinced that we all have to take our part to prevent and stop the spread of the virus. It is our responsibility, as a society. And having our athletes, coaches, officials and staff travelling around the world at this challenging time is not something that we in World Triathlon are willing to risk.\nFollowing the postponement of several races, including multiple World Triathlon events and the Olympic Games, ITU made the decision on April 3 to extend its suspension of activities until June 30. As the pandemic progressed, an increasing number events went from postponements to cancellations, thus shortening the 2020 World Triathlon Season. On August 25, ITU announced that the 2020 World Triathlon Champions would be determined at the Hamburg World Triathlon Event, which was set to take place on September 5 after being postponed from July 11. In addition to hosting the sole World Triathlon Series event, Hamburg was set to host the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championship on September 6."

After ending the first round of eliminations on a 2–5 record, the team won only one game before going on a six-game losing streak to end the tournament, which was marked by blowout losses that broke the UAAP record for the largest losing margins.\nThey began their season with a 25-point loss against the FEU Tamaraws in a game played behind closed doors. The UAAP had earlier decided to hold the first four playing schedules under a bubble setup in observance of COVID-19 safety precautions. UST had five more blowout losses in the season that included their 44-point marginal defeat against FEU in their last playing date in the second round to surpass their 43-point loss to the De La Salle Green Archers back in 2016. Their 50-point loss to the Ateneo Blue Eagles in the second round set the mark for the league's biggest losing margin since 2003. They also lost against the NU Bulldogs by 31 points in the first round, and by 29 points each to La Salle and the UP Fighting Maroons in the second round. Their 83–112 defeat against the Green Archers enabled their opponents to breach the 100-point barrier in the season.\nRoster.\nUST has listed Ivan Lazarte, Rafael Pangilinan, Rafael Biag, and Patrick Javier on their reserve list, where any of the four players can be activated to replace players who would test positive for COVID-19.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nRoster changes.\n13 out of the 16 players from the 2019 UAAP runner-up team have departed.

The UAAP later handed Ayo an indefinite ban from all league-sanctioned activities, having found the seasoned coach liable in endangering the health and well-being of his team by holding a training camp during the pandemic.\nResigned assistant coach and Tiger Cubs head coach Jino Manansala was called back by the Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) and was appointed interim coach of the team to replace Ayo on October 8, 2020. IPEA earlier announced the start of the basketball program's rebuilding phase as it was moving forward without a permanent head coach.\nReturning with Manansala were assistant coaches McJour Luib, Joph Cleopas, JR Carlos, and Jason Misolas.

An emotional Izzo after the game said he hoped the team had come through for the MSU community with the win.

After the heartbreaking loss against Iowa in the prior game, the Spartans started off extremely slow and fell behind by as many as 15 in the first half against the Cornhuskers.

MSU would lead for the remainder of the first half against a Marquette team whose starting point guard, Tyler Kolek, had suffered a thumb injury in their first round game against the 15-seeded Vermont Catamounts two days prior. Kolek, recently named the Big East Player of the Year, was effectively neutralized as MSU would hold him to game totals of 7 points and 5 assists and force Kolek into a career-high 6 turnovers, despite Kolek's season averages of 12.9 ppg, 7.5 apg (third highest amongst Division I players in 2022-23) and 2.5 topg. However, after Carson Cooper's dunk with 6:12 remaining in the first half gave MSU their largest lead of 12 points, the Golden Eagles responded by outscoring MSU 13-6 to close the half as Hoggard, having picked up his second foul with 5:23 remaining, sat on the bench during most of Marquette's run.

        "text": "The Equestrian Statue of Albert I (; ) is a bronze equestrian statue erected in Brussels, Belgium, in memory of King Albert I, third King of the Belgians. It was created by the sculptor in 1951.\nThe statue stands on the /, at the point where the Mont des Arts/Kunstberg joins the /, and a few tens of metres from the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR). This area is served by Brussels-Central railway station.\nHistory.\nThe accidental death of King Albert I in 1934 aroused great emotion in Belgium, and many cities planned to pay homage to him. In Brussels, the form that this tribute should take, monument or architectural or urban development, was subject to discussion. It was ultimately the classical and traditional option of sculpture that won out.\nThe first project by the sculptor Alfred Courtens in the form of a model was submitted in 1943, then revised and finally approved in 1946. The Second World War and the lack of materials further delayed the monument's construction. Finally, in 1951, the sculpture, cast by the \"Compagnie des Bronzes de Bruxelles\", was brought to the site in three parts to facilitate transport (the body of the horse, its head, and the effigy of the king) and placed on the base designed by Jules Ghobert, one of the architects of the Royal Library of Belgium (KBR).\nDescription.\nThe imposing bronze equestrian statue is placed high on a pedestal made of blocks of blue stone, dominating the town centre. Albert I is represented there in a classical way as a soldier king wearing the military coat and holding a helmet in his hand. The style is reminiscent of that of the Equestrian Statue of Leopold II on the /, whose author, Thomas Vinçotte, was Courtens's teacher. The sculptor justified the choice to represent his model bareheaded by the fear that the shadow of the helmet would hide his face.\nThe monument is part of an overall project including the Mont des Arts and the Royal Library of Belgium, dedicated to Albert I and nicknamed in French or in Dutch (today KBR), the first stone of which would however only be laid three years after the statue's inauguration."

        "text": "Paul John Avis (14 April 1958 – December 2006) was a South African psychologist and professional tennis player.\nBorn in Transvaal, Avis was a Junior Springbok and national closed singles champion. He competed on the international tennis tour in the 1970s and 1980s, ranking amongst the world's top 200 and South Africa's top 10. During his career he had a third round appearance at the 1975 South African Open and featured in qualifying for the 1976 Wimbledon Championships.\nAvis was known as 'The King of the Portuguese Hall' when he dominated the vibrant tennis tournaments played at this venue in Turffontein during the 1980s and was at his peak considered one of the best players in the country. In 1979 Avis ruled the local tennis scene, winning almost every title including that of the Philips Masters, SA Closed, Philips Challenger Series and the Defence Force. At the beginning of 1979, he swept through the elite Masters field stunning top seeded Johan Kriek in the final. At the end of the year Avis ranked second in the country after winning the Eastern Province Sugar Circuit tournament at the age of 22. He was often referred to as \"The Quiet Man\" of South African Tennis because of his reserved manner. However his game was considered nothing less than explosive. Avis played in one of the first televised Tennis matches in South Africa, the South African open at Ellis park.\nAvis retired from tennis at an early age to focus on his studies, and in 1994 completed a doctorate in Sports Psychology. He then became a lecturer in the Psychology Department at the Daveyton Campus of Vista University, but continued his tennis coaching and had a private practice as Clinical Psychologist in Benoni. He was also involved as Sport Psychologist at the ITF Academy at Ellis Park. At the time of his death, from lung cancer in 2006, he had been a professor of Sport Psychology at the University of the Western Cape."

The regular season ended on March 12, 2023, with the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament beginning on March 14 and ending with the championship game at American Airlines Center in Dallas on April 2.\nRule changes.\nThe following rule changes will be recommended by the NCAA Basketball Rules Committee to the Playing Rules Oversight Panel for 2022−23 season:\nTBD\nm, m\nConference membership changes.\nTwenty-six schools joined new conferences or became independents, including five schools from Division II that started transitions to Division I this season and one in the transition process from Division I to Division III.\nAs noted previously, Incarnate Word backed out of a planned move from the Southland Conference to the Western Athletic Conference, and Lamar, which had planned to make the opposite move in 2023, pushed this move forward to 2022.\nThe 2022−23 season was the last for at least 16 Division I schools in their then-current conferences, and for one Division II school before reclassification to Division I. It was also Hartford's only season as a D-I independent and the last season of athletics for St. Francis Brooklyn.\nArenas.\nArenas of new D-I teams.\nAll five new D-I members in 2022–23 play on their respective campuses.\nArenas closing.\nThe following D-I programs plan to open new arenas for the 2023−24 season, or move home games to a pre-existing venue. All will move within their current campuses otherwise indicated.\nSeasonal outlook.\nThe Top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaching polls\nTop 10 matchups.\nRankings reflect the AP poll Top 25.\nRegular season.\nUpsets.\nAn upset is a victory by an underdog team. In the context of NCAA Division I women's basketball, this generally constitutes an unranked team defeating a team currently \nranked in the top 25. This list will highlight those upsets of ranked teams by unranked teams as well as upsets of No. 1 teams. Rankings are from the AP poll. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nIn addition to the upsets in which an unranked team defeated a ranked team, this list includes non-Division I teams to defeat Division I teams. Bold type indicates winning teams in \"true road games\"—i.e., those played on an opponent's home court (including secondary homes).\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences will end its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference receives the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. Unless otherwise noted, the winners of these tournaments will receive automatic invitations to the 2023 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nStatistical leaders.\nIncludes postseason games.\nPostseason.\nTournament upsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded two or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2023 tournament has nine upsets so far, with five in the first round, three in the second round, and one in the Sweet Sixteen. Stanford's loss to Ole Miss marked the first time a No. 1 seed failed to make the Sweet Sixteen since 2009. With Indiana's loss to Miami, this marked the first time two No. 1 seeds failed to make the Sweet Sixteen since 1998.\nWomen's Basketball Invitational.\nThis season saw the debut of a third national postseason tournament in the Women's Basketball Invitational, a 16-team affair with all games played on home courts.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nBefore the 2017–18 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017–18. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single ten-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nMany teams changed coaches during and after the season."

        "text": "Tom Parsons (born 25 June 1990) is a New Zealand rugby union player, who currently plays as a lock for in New Zealand's domestic National Provincial Championship competition and Urayasu D-Rocks in Japan Rugby League One.\nEarly career and personal life.\nParsons attended Lindisfarne College (2004-2008) and is a former player and captain of the college's 1st XV team. He is the son of former loose forward Rod Parsons (1988-1989, 18 games). His brother Ben Parsons also played 3 games at lock for the Magpies in 2017. Former All Blacks and Blues hooker James Parsons is his cousin.\nSenior career.\nParsons was – for the first time – named in the Hawke's Bay squad ahead of the 2012 ITM Cup season. He made his NPC debut for the Magpies on 21 September 2012, via the reserves bench, in a tight 42–41 win over . In his first three seasons, he played 15 games for the province.\nIn 2015, Parsons signed with . He debuted for the Turbos on 16 August 2015 against . He played 29 games for Manawatū in three seasons.\nParsons returned to Hawke's Bay and was named in the Magpies squad for the 2018 Mitre 10 Cup season. That season turned out to become his breakout season, in which he became a regular starter for Hawke's Bay. On 23 October 2018, Parsons won the Magpies Player of the Year award and Forward of the Year award at the team's end-of-season awards function.\nOn 27 November 2019, Japanese club Toshiba Brave Lupus announced the signing of Parsons on a six-month contract for their 2020 Top League season. He made his debut for the club on 18 January 2020 in a game against NTT DoCoMo Red Hurricanes. He played only four games for the side because the 2020 Top League season was cancelled after round 6 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe returned to Hawke's Bay for the 2020 Mitre 10 Cup season, which turned out to be a successful one. The Magpies won the Ranfurly Shield, successfully defended the Shield three times and won the Mitre 10 Cup Championship, thus securing a well-deserved promotion to the Premiership division. The Magpies held on to the Shield during the entire 2021 Bunnings NPC season, winning all six Ranfurly Shield defences. Parsons captained the team in the last few rounds of the season, after long-term captain Ash Dixon had left to play in Japan.\nOver the years, Parsons turned out for the Development team on a regular basis, but despite several strong seasons for , he wasn't offered a Super Rugby contract. During the 2021 Super Rugby season, he was called into the squad as short-term injury cover, but didn't get any game time.\nWhile not being named in the initial squad for the 2022 Super Rugby Pacific season, Parsons was eventually offered a contract and joined the franchise during preseason. He made his Super Rugby debut for the Hurricanes – off the bench – on 25 March 2022 against . His starting debut followed in the return game against Moana Pasifika on 12 April 2022.\nOn 15 February 2024, Urayasu D-Rocks announced that Parsons would be joining the club for the remainder of the 2023–2024 Japan Rugby League One season."

        "text": "Kent Hughes (born January 21, 1970) is a Canadian former ice hockey player and sports agent, and current general manager of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nEarly life and career.\nA Montreal native, Hughes grew up in the West Island (Pierrefonds and Beaconsfield, Quebec) and played bantam AA hockey for the West Island Royals and midget AAA for the Lac St-Louis Lions. In 1987–88, he played for the Cégep de Saint-Laurent Patriotes, helping his team win the league championship. He later attended Middlebury College, where he was the captain of the hockey team for the 1991-92 season. Hughes earned a Juris Doctor degree from Boston College in 1996 before becoming a player agent.\nHughes became a player agent in 1998, when he began to represent first overall pick Vincent Lecavalier. In 2016, his agency MFIVE SPORT merged with Quartexx, and became one of the biggest agencies in the NHL, overseeing more than 290 million dollars worth of contracts. Hughes represented a multitude of NHL players including Patrice Bergeron, Kris Letang, Darnell Nurse, Sammy Blais, Alex Newhook, Colin White, Drake Batherson, Anthony Beauvillier, Marco Scandella, and Alexis Lafrenière.\nExecutive career.\nHughes first became acquainted with hockey executive Jeff Gorton when both lived in Boston, with the latter working for the Boston Bruins. Gorton first attempted to recruit Hughes to work with him while he was general manager of the New York Rangers, but he declined. Gorton was later hired by Geoff Molson to be executive vice president of hockey operations for the Montreal Canadiens, after having sacked general manager Marc Bergevin after the team had a historically disastrous start to the 2021–22 NHL season, and began a search for a replacement. Hughes was persuaded to interview for the job, which he considered a \"dream\" position. His hiring as the eighteenth general manager in team history was announced on January 18, 2022. Molson would subsequently characterize Hughes' hiring as the beginning of a team \"rebuild\", a process that the franchise had heretofore avoided in its modern history.\nWhile it was initially announced that coach Dominique Ducharme would be retained for the remainder of the season, but after the team had lost seven consecutive games at the beginning of 2022, most by blowout margins, Hughes removed Ducharme and replaced him with retired star forward Martin St. Louis. St. Louis had no professional coaching experience, but was immediately well-received. Beginning a plan to revamp the team's roster, Hughes executed a series of trades in his first two months, parting with players Tyler Toffoli, Ben Chiarot, Brett Kulak and Artturi Lehkonen to secure new draft picks and prospects. Following the season's end, Hughes announced the creation of the Canadiens' first in-house analytics department.\nHughes' first draft as general manager was consequential both in that Montreal was the host and the team, as a result of its last-place finish, was picking first overall for the first time since 1980. The Canadiens selected Slovak winger Juraj Slafkovský first overall, departing from the longstanding consensus that had favoured Canadian centre Shane Wright. On the day of the draft, Hughes also executed a series of trades to acquire former third overall pick Kirby Dach from the Chicago Blackhawks. In the same off-season, Hughes fulfilled the trade request from defenceman Jeff Petry by trading him to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Mike Matheson, a former client of his. The trade was generally considered a success for the Canadiens after its first year.\nIn Hughes' first full year as general manager, the Canadiens finished fifth-last in the league. In advance of the 2023 NHL Entry Draft, Hughes traded the thirty-first overall selection that he acquired in the Chiarot trade the year prior to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Alex Newhook, another of his former clients, who was subsequently signed to an extension. With the Canadiens' own first round selection being fifth overall, the team opted to take Austrian EHC Kloten defenceman David Reinbacher over Russian SKA Saint Petersburg forward Matvei Michkov. This choice proved controversial, given the latter's projected scoring talent and the Canadiens' lack of offensive depth.\nPersonal life.\nHughes' brother Ryan was a second round pick of the Quebec Nordiques in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. Hughes' eldest son Riley was a seventh-round pick of the New York Rangers in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. His youngest son Jack plays for Northeastern University and was a second-round pick of the Los Angeles Kings in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft. He also has a daughter, Morgan."

Because of the Covid-19 Pandemic, it was the first tournament held since 2019. The top ranked team in the nation, Adrian, won the program's first national championship.\nQualifying teams.\nTwelve teams qualified for the tournament in the following ways: (Pool A) eight teams received bids as a result of being conference tournament champions from conferences that possessed an automatic bid, (Pool C) four additional teams received at-large bids based upon their records.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of play. All rounds were single-game elimination.\nThe top four rated teams received byes into the quarterfinal round and were arranged so that if they were to advance to the semifinals, the first seed would play the fourth seed and the second seed would play the third seed. Because two western teams received byes, the two eastern schools that were furthest west geographically, and did not receive byes, were placed in the same quarterfinal bracket and set to play against the eastern-most of the two western teams to receive byes. This was done so that the travel distance for the victor would be as short as possible. The remaining two western teams were placed in the same quarterfinal bracket as the other western quarterfinalist.\nThe remaining four eastern teams were arranged so that the highest-ranked first round team would play the lowest-ranked first round team with the winner advancing to play the lower eastern quarterfinalist. The higher-ranked of the two eastern quarterfinalists would play the winner of the final first round game.\nIn the First Round and Quarterfinals the higher-seeded team served as host. Beginning with the semifinals, all games were held at the Herb Brooks Arena."

        "title": "2020 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 2020 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team was scheduled to represent the University of Santo Tomas in the 83rd season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, but then the COVID-19 pandemic struck and it affected all sporting events worldwide. The rest of the UAAP tournaments in the second semester of Season 82 were discontinued and eventually terminated in April 2020. A belated opening of Season 83 was planned for January 2021, but the UAAP board eventually decided on cancelling the entire season amid the continued community quarantine measures that would affect the athletes' training and social gathering in general. This was the first time since World War II that an entire season is cancelled by the league.\nThe Tigers were participating in the 2020 PBA D-League Aspirants' Cup as part of their preseason training and had already played two games before its indefinite suspension on March 11. The league formally announced the cancellation of the tournament in September.\nPreseason roster.\nThere were three graduating players from the 2019 UST Growling Tigers roster. Point guard Renzo Subido was drafted into the PBA in December 2019, while center Enrique Caunan who saw limited minutes in the concluded UAAP season had been left out. Only Zach Huang remained in the 15-man lineup that competed in the PBA D-League tournament.\nThree other Season 82 mainstays, Miguel Pangilinan, Albert Bordeos, and Nat Cosejo were excluded from the preseason roster. Taking over their spots were Team B members Paul Manalang, Ian Herrera, and Christian Manaytay. A fourth player, Jorden Santos came all the way from Virginia.\nSchedule and results.\nThe PBA D-League games were aired on 5 Plus and ESPN 5.\nSummary.\nThe D-League Aspirants' Cup tournament was set to begin on February 13, 2020, but the organizers decided on pushing it back to March 2 following safety protocols imposed by the government in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nComing off a runner-up finish in the just-concluded UAAP basketball tournament, the Growling Tigers had aimed to build on that momentum with a strong showing in the said tournament. They defeated their opponents by an average margin of 33 points before the league went on another break due to rising cases of COVID-19 infections.\nUST had a 53-point blowout in their 115–62 win over the Technological Institute of the Philippines. Their 23 three-point shot conversions surpassed their record of 16 in the UAAP. Deo Cuajao contributed 7 of those threes to topscore for the team with 24 points. Junjun Asuncion continued the attack in the fourth quarter by shooting 5 more threes to finish the game with 20 points. The Tigers opened the game on a 20–5 run which ended on a 30–16 first quarter score. Their lead had ballooned to 29 points at the end of the third quarter.\nThe Growling Tigers had another quick start in their game against Diliman College by racing to a 16–5 lead. They had poured on the points to end the first quarter with a score of 37–18. UST went on to lead the Blue Dragons by at least 30 points numerous times in the game before their starters were called back to the bench. They were outscored, 14–29 in the fourth quarter as Diliman managed to narrow down the lead to only 13 points at the end of the game. Soulémane Chabi Yo topscored for 24 points and was aided by Dave Ando's double-double of 14 points and 11 rebounds.\nWith Coach Aldin Ayo stressing the need for the players to familiarize themselves with his coaching system, the Growling Tigers displayed their three-point shooting efficiency in different scenarios. In their game against TIP, the team went on a high 50 field goal percentage when they made 23 of their 46 three-point shot attempts.\nIn their two games, they averaged a 57-percent accuracy on spot-up threes, 52 percent of which were from contested shots and an even higher 62 percent on uncontested attempts. The players also converted a respectable 37 percent of three-point attempts when moving from picks or evading a defender. In more difficult cases of Pull-up jumpers from beyond the arc, they had been successful twice in their eight attempts for a 25-percent clip.\nSorsogon bubble.\nCJ Cansino's departure from the team signified the start of the Growling Tigers' saga in 2020 as allegations of multiple violations of quarantine protocols and insufficient living, dietary and health conditions caused player transfers, suspension and resignation of the team's top officials, and eventually the involvement of government bodies to step in and join the investigations on the said allegations.\nSequence of events.\nOn August 20, 2020, The Varsitarian through their official Twitter account broke the news of Cansino's departure from the Growling Tigers' roster. In the tweet, the school's student publication had mentioned that both the player and management had reached an agreement to \"part ways.\"\nCansino in an interview disputed The Varsitarian's report on the two parties' agreement, claiming that he was removed even though he did not want to leave. An ABS-CBN Sports article reported that Cansino's removal was due to his \"defiance of authority,\" where sources close to the team elaborated on how he approached the coaching staff on behalf of the team to relay their desire to go back to their respective homes. The cause of his removal was not clarified in the article, but it added that he was initially removed as team captain before the eviction from the roster.\nUP Fighting Maroons coach Bo Perasol later announced that Cansino has committed to their team. Throughout the events that were unfolding, social media went abuzz on speculations of the existence of a \"Bicol Bubble,\" a term coined by sports writers in reference to the NBA Bubble, when the American league resumed their 2019–20 season by bringing together the players, coaches and personnel of the teams in one single place. Members of the Growling Tigers were allegedly quartered to conduct training activities. Sorsogon, located in the Bicol region is the home province of Aldin Ayo.\nThe media spectacle began reaching the attention of government agencies with the Games and Amusements Board announcing that they will begin investigating the incident over possible quarantine violations. A video surfaced around social media outlets showing members of the team conducting shooting practices. A number of commenters pointed out that the location was in Capuy, Sorsogon and that the team had been staying there since the middle of June.\nThe Philippine Star's Abac Cordero posted on his Twitter account a photographed document, appearing to be a copy of a waiver by the players' parent or guardian that allows them their participation in the bubble. The document was addressed to the school's athletic director, Fr. Jannel Abogado.\nCoach Aldin Ayo finally issued a statement on the issue, saying \"marked differences\" between him and Cansino had caused the player's exit. The statement added that Ayo had chosen to refrain from making additional comments as the school had already begun their own investigation, though he was giving his assurance to fully cooperate with the inquiries by UST and the government agencies.\nThe Varsitarian reported Abogado's resignation just before a scheduled meeting of school officials with the government's Inter-Agency Task Force that would discuss the team's alleged quarantine guideline violations. He was replaced by former director of UST's Institute of Physical Eduacation and Athletics, Fr. Ermito de Sagon who was set to sit on an interim capacity.\nUST has ordered a stoppage of the team's training in Sorsogon. Ayo gathered the players to inform them of the school's directive to send them home, pending the completion of travel documents and other government clearance requirements.\nIn a now-deleted social media post, Cansino shared six screenshot images from a Facebook group chat among the players and their parents regarding complaints about their living conditions in Sorsogon. In the thread, Cansino had relayed that the food being served to them was not to his preference, adding some of his teammates have resorted to ordering fast food instead. Soulémane Chabi Yo complained of experiencing homesickness and poor mobile phone signal, while Rhenz Abando said that no one from the staff was tending to the players who have become sick during their stay there.\nThe Commission on Higher Education has joined the investigation and announced that it was looking into UST officials' involvement and accountability in the team's \"bubble\" training. The CHED was tapped to join the tripartite of the Philippine Sports Commission, the GAB, and the Department of Health under the Joint Administrative Order, as the said JAO only covers professional sports teams.\nThe UAAP board presented UST's investigation result and recommendations to the JAO and CHED. They were looking into which government agency had the authority to mete out sanctions on the school for their violation of the government's health protocols. The JAO earlier gave UST their permission to conduct their own investigation on the team's training bubble. UST submitted their internal report to the board on August 28.\nAldin Ayo has stepped down from his position as head coach of the Growling Tigers' senior men's basketball team. In his resignation letter, he extended his apologies to the people affected by condemnations thrown at the team as a result of the \"Bubble\" issue and reiterated his commitment to taking responsibility and willingness to face appropriate sanctions.\nUST formally accepted Ayo's resignation, as well as those of his two assistant coaches, McJour Luib and Jino Manansala. While thanking the three coaches, an official statement read that the basketball program was moving forward to a rebuilding phase without a head coach.\nThe UAAP board has handed down an indefinite ban on Aldin Ayo. The league came up with the conclusion that the resigned coach has endangered the \"health and well-being\" of his players by holding a training camp, which was a violation of the government's health protocols amid the pandemic. The league's Board of Managing Directors recommended the sanction and was ratified by the Board of Trustees, which are composed of the UAAP's eight member school presidents. The ban prohibits Ayo from participating in any capacity, in all UAAP events and UAAP-sanctioned activities.\nJimi Lim's Ironcon Builders withdrew their sponsorship of the Growling Tigers' basketball program. The consortium came onboard before the start of the 2019 UAAP season to take over Chuck Dumlao's FMR Corporation and to mainly give support to Aldin Ayo. With this new partnership, the team was able to recruit blue chips from the high school ranks, boosting not only the senior men's team, but also their junior counterpart, the UST Tiger Cubs basketball program. With Ayo's resignation, Ironcon decided to also leave.\nMark Nonoy and Deo Cuajao, in an interview disputed claims made by Cansino on what transpired in their training camp in Sorsogon. Nonoy clarified that the players did not hold any scrimmages as they trained separately in different batches and in different facilities within Ayo's property. Regarding their sleeping arrangements, Cuajao said that three players were staying in one room. He did not address the issue about the group chat complaints, adding the players involved came to Sorsogon a month before he and Nonoy arrived. On Cansino's narration about their movements being restricted within the \"bubble,\" the two denied it by saying that anyone in the team was able to leave and come back freely at any time.\nThe Sorsogon Philippine National Police found no violation committed by Ayo with regards to the IATF quarantine guidelines. A memorandum submitted by the police agency to Sorsogon Governor Chiz Escudero has cleared the former Growling Tigers coach from any liabilities in the COVID-19 safety precautions. They also concluded that no school-sanctioned basketball training occurred within Ayo's property during the team's stay from June until August and certified the team's compliance in securing documents, travel passes, tests and the mandatory quarantine period upon their arrival in Sorsogon.\nUST sent a letter to the UAAP endorsing Ayo's appeal for reconsideration on his indefinite ban.\nThe UAAP released a statement acknowledging UST's letter of endorsement of their former coach's appeal on his sanction. In their reply, the statement read that the said appeal will be tackled by the association in \"due time.\" Reports bared that among the contents of UST's letter was a statement that they do not accept the findings of the Sorsogon PNP which absolved Ayo of any IATF violations and insisted on the correctness of the report that they earlier submitted prior to the meeting with JAO.\nAldin Ayo's appeal as well as UST's endorsement to lessen the former coach's sanction remained in limbo. When asked about the status of the case, UAAP executive director Rebo Saguisag replied that the board has yet to set a date for discussing the matter while awaiting investigations by the CHED and the Department of Justice.\nThe CHED has completed their fact-finding report in October and has turned it over to the DOJ, who they claimed has the jurisdiction with regards to the IATF rules that the team may have violated. CHED Chairman Popoy de Vera opined that from reading UST's internal report, there was clearly some training done in Sorsogon involving UST's basketball players.\nThe DOJ earlier said in a statement that they were evaluating whether or not the department had jurisdiction over the report submitted to them by the CHED. A DOJ official who was interviewed on the condition of anonymity gave his opinion on how the investigation was more of administrative, rather than criminal in nature and had doubted that the department would have jurisdiction over it. The official was short in ruling out any criminal liability due to the Sorsogon PNP clearing the parties involved in the bubble.\nDOJ Secretary Menardo Guevarra said in an interview in November that the department has not started an investigation as they were yet to receive a formal complaint against Ayo or UST. It was also revealed that the DOJ has returned the report to CHED over jurisdiction issues.\nThe UAAP announced the cancellation of Season 83 due to lingering COVID cases that kept students out of schools and forced them to remain into quarantines. The decision was made after a series of meetings by the league's Board of Trustees, putting to priority the health and safety of the student-athletes. The league earlier ruled against the regular opening of games in the first semester of the school year in September, but had considered a January start with all games to be played in the second semester.\nExodus of players.\nIn the midst of investigations into the Sorsogon bubble controversy and the high probability of a suspension from the UAAP, the Growling Tigers saw the departure of seven of their Season 82 players.\nTimeline of transfers.\nCJ Cansino was able to transfer to UP in less than twenty-four hours after news of his expulsion from the Growling Tigers' roster went around social and sports media.\nBrent Paraiso announced his departure from the team shortly after being back in Manila from Sorsogon. Paraiso reportedly dropped all his subjects in the first semester of the 2020–21 school year. His transfer to Letran was finalized on September 4.\nAccording to sources, Rhenz Abando and Ira Bataller moved out of their dormitory in UST the day after arriving from Sorsogon. They both went on to transfer to Letran with Paraiso.\nJunjun Asuncion became the fifth Tiger to leave the team. The Varsitarian reported that the second-year forward had transferred to Mapua.\nMark Nonoy and Deo Cuajao finalized their move to La Salle after two days of waiting for UST's endorsement of Aldin Ayo's appeal to the UAAP on his indefinite ban. According to player agent Jax Chua, the two wanted to play for Ayo, but had to make a decision before the deadline of enrollment for the first semester.\nIncoming rookie and former Tiger Cubs main man Bismarck Lina made his transfer to UP to reunite with former high school teammate CJ Cansino. The Batang Gilas mainstay had originally committed to the senior men's team of UST in February, but decided to leave due to the Sorsogon Bubble controversy.\nRebuilding the team.\nFormer UST High School principal Fr. Rodel Cansancio was appointed Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) director on September 23 to take over the comebacking Fr. Ermito de Sagon, who had in turn assumed the position as interim director after Fr. Jannel Abogado's resignation at the height of the Sorsogon Bubble investigations. Fr. Cansancio has been tasked to lead the depleted basketball team in its rebuilding process, the first task of which is the selection of the next head coach after the now-resigned Aldin Ayo.\nResigned assistant coach and former Growling Tiger Jino Manansala was called back and was appointed interim head coach on October 8. He was chosen among a list of nine applicants that included fellow former Tigers Ed Cordero, Ernesto Ballesteros, Gilbert Lao, and Aries Dimaunahan, as well as Philippine Basketball Association legendary import Sean Chambers. In an interview, Manansala had said that his appointment was due to the school's wish for the continuity of Ayo's brand of \"mayhem\" basketball. The new coach further emphasized that they are rebuilding but not restructuring the basketball program."

        "title": "Harvard fencing scandal of 2020",
        "text": "In December 2020, Jie \"Jack\" Zhao and former head fencing coach Peter Brand were indicted by a grand jury on accusations of conspiracy and bribery for Zhao's two sons to be accepted at Harvard University. They were accused of exchanging more than $1.5 million in bribes. \nHowever, both brothers were athletic and academic standouts prior to their recruitment and competed at meets throughout their tenure on the team. Additionally, Eric Zhao served as the team captain of Harvard Fencing (chosen by the team via popular vote).\nBy the jury's unanimous decision, both Jie \"Jack\" Zhao and Peter Brand were cleared of all charges on December 21, 2022. The jury deliberated for only five hours before returning the not guilty verdict.\nFencing.\nFencing is an NCAA sport. Top fencers around the nation have the opportunity to be recruited to a college, often slightly or significantly boosting their chances of acceptance with the opportunity to receive a scholarship. Top universities like MIT, Boston College, and The Ohio State University all have both men's and women's NCAA fencing teams.\nConspiracy Accusation.\nMaryland businessman Jie \"Jack\" Zhao and Harvard's former head fencing coach Peter Brand connected for years before Harvard accepted either of Zhao's sons. Over the course of five years, Zhao was accused of paying for Brand's car, part of Brand's son's college tuition at Penn State, the mortgage on Brand's house, Brand's water and sewer bills, and renovations for Brand's new house. In total, Zhao had been accused of spending over $1.5 million in alleged bribes. In 2016, Zhao bought Brand's house for twice as much as its initial value, paying almost $1 million. Zhao never lived in the house and later sold it for $665,000.\nHowever, the defense was able to prove that the entire sum of money in question were loans to Brand that had already been paid back in full with interest to Zhao by 2021.\nZhao and Brand began communicating in 2012 when Brand told co-conspirator Alexandre Ryjik that Jack doesn't need to take him anywhere and his boys don't have to be great fencers, and what Brand needed is a good incentive to recruit the boys. Ryjik was initially labeled as \"co-conspirator 1,\" or \"CC1,\" in the criminal complaint, but eventually, the \"Boston Globe\" identified him as a coach for the Virginia Academy of Fencing. Brand later told Ryjik that he simply needed a \"good incentive\" to recruit Zhao's sons. Zhao's company allegedly bought Ryjik his 40,000-square-foot building and property and gave about $1 million to Ryjik's fencing foundation. According to prosecutors, Zhao spent about $2.4 million because the co-conspirator took $900,000 of Zhao's money, including more than $31,000 of Zhao's sons' college tuition money. Zhao had a plan to donate $1 million to Ryjik, which would then be passed to a charity organization controlled by Brand. Zhao ultimately paid $100,000 to Brand's charity foundation.\nThe situation was brought to light on April 1, 2019, when \"Harvard was made aware of allegations involving Peter Brand.\" On April 4, 2019, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences publicly released a statement regarding these allegations, revealing that the admissions process involves a vote of approximately 40 committee members and an interview with the student-athlete.\nOn July 6, 2019, former athletic director Bob Scalise said in an emailed statement that Harvard had fired Brand due to a violation of their conflict-of-interest policy; \"conflict of interest exists when individual commitment to the University may be compromised by personal benefit.\"\nBoth Zhao and Brand denied the allegations against them, saying both sons academically and athletically stood out. According to Zhao's attorney, William Weinrub, Zhao did not give anybody money for their acceptance to Harvard.\nThis case is separate from the infamous Operation Varsity Blues scandal. Zhao and Rick Singer, the driver of the famous scandal, have no connection to one another. Although some people have drawn parallels to the two situations, as both scandals involved parents bribing somebody to get their children into college, there are several differences between the two cases. For example, both of Zhao's sons had high standardized test scores and had a track record of fencing for many years prior to applying to Harvard. Additionally, there was no legal agreement between Zhao and a Harvard University employee which guaranteed that the brothers would be admitted to the university in exchange for financial compensation.\nRecruitment.\nAccording to court testimony from David L. Evans, a Harvard admissions officer with over 50 years of experience, Brand's athletic designation of the Zhao brothers \"made the difference\" in their admission. Evans further testified that the brothers' “personal qualities” and extracurricular activities were “nothing special” in comparison to other applicants. \nZhao's older son, Eric, enrolled at Harvard in the fall of 2014. During his time at Harvard, Eric was elected captain of the Harvard fencing team by his peers and was named second-team All-Ivy after helping Harvard win the 2018 Ivy League Championships. Edward, Zhao's younger son, enrolled at Harvard in 2017. Prior to the cancellation of the 2020 fencing season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Edward posted a 27–24 record during his career on Harvard's fencing team \nEric had already graduated from the university at the time of arrest, while Edward was in his final year of his undergraduate studies. In an interview with Eric, he said he had no knowledge of the donation."

        "title": "Friday Night Baseball",
        "text": "Friday Night Baseball is a live broadcast of Major League Baseball (MLB) games on Apple TV+ that debuted during the league's 2022 season. The weekly broadcast is produced by MLB Network, featuring a doubleheader with pregame and postgame analysis. The broadcast is available in the North American market consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico as well as select overseas markets including Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, with plans to expand availability of the broadcast to more regions in the future.\nHistory.\nIn March 2022, Apple Inc. signed a seven-year deal with MLB for the broadcast for US$85 million per year, a total value of $595 million. This includes an annual $55 million rights fee as well as $30 million for Apple advertising. Apple has the right to exit the agreement after the first or second year. The deal was the first sports broadcasting contract ever acquired by Apple. Plans for the broadcast were formally announced on March 8, 2022, at Apple's Peek Performance event and later in an online press release.\nThe first broadcast date was initially made uncertain as the deal was signed amidst the 2021–22 MLB lockout and the threat of cancelled games. After the lockout was resolved, MLB announced that the first games would air on April 8, 2022, with a doubleheader of New York Mets–Washington Nationals and Houston Astros–Los Angeles Angels as the inaugural matchups. Apple also announced that \"Friday Night Baseball\" will be free-of-charge for its first 12 weeks of broadcasts, although this was later extended for the rest of the inaugural season.\nOn April 7, 2022, Apple announced that Melanie Newman, Chris Young, Hannah Keyser, and Brooke Fletcher would be the inaugural broadcast crew for east coast games, while Stephen Nelson, Hunter Pence, Katie Nolan, and Heidi Watney would be the broadcast crew for west coast games. Lauren Gardner was announced as the pregame and postgame studio host, along with a rotation of MLB Network studio analysts including Carlos Peña, Cliff Floyd, and Yonder Alonso. Former MLB umpire Brian Gorman was also hired as a rules analyst.\nOn September 23, 2022, St. Louis Cardinals designated hitter Albert Pujols hit the 700th home run of his career during a \"Friday Night Baseball\" game against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nWith the announcement of the \"Friday Night Baseball\" schedule for the first half of the 2023 MLB season, Apple announced that they had signed a deal with DirecTV to distribute \"Friday Night Baseball\" to their commercial subscribers, ensuring availability to venues (such as bars and restaurants) that were not readily equipped to handle streaming-only broadcasts. DirecTV had previously signed similar deals with Amazon Prime Video for their Thursday Night Football broadcasts, as well as with Apple for MLS Season Pass broadcasts. Apple also announced that they would add alternative audio feeds allowing viewers in the United States and Canada to listen to local radio broadcasts from the home team or the away team instead of the regular audio feed. It was also announced that, unlike the inaugural season, an Apple TV+ subscription would now be required to watch \"Friday Night Baseball\".\nFor the 2024 MLB season, Apple announced that its studio coverage would be on-site for select games.\nReception.\nThe initial \"Friday Night Baseball\" broadcasts were met with mixed reviews that largely praised its visual production, but criticized its commentary crew's performance. Many fans objected to the games being unavailable on cable television networks and to the need for additional hardware to watch \"Friday Night Baseball\" on their televisions.\nSix Colors praised its \"special\" production which \"push[ed] the envelope\", noting that the production featured more cameras than a typical broadcast, and more commentators, which he compared to the higher production fare often reserved for ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" broadcasts, or postseason games, which are produced by other broadcasters such as Fox Sports. The Six Colors review praised the diversity of the commentary crew, while criticizing the volume of commercials (including product placement) and the lack of a rewind feature in the Apple TV+ app. A writer for \"The Verge\" said that the debut broadcast \"left some fans frustrated and disappointed\", upset with streaming issues and poor commentary quality. Some fans found the commentary to be \"distracting, and sometimes blatantly off-topic\".\nWFAN hosts Gregg Giannotti and Boomer Esiason, during their radio show \"Boomer and Gio\", were more negative about the initial broadcast. Giannotti said, \"They don't think the game stands on its own. They were talking about a lot of things that have nothing to do with the game … they're putting people in there that don't have any experience\". Esiason said that the broadcast was \"unlistenable\", but that he expects improvements in the future.\nApple Insider noted that while many praised the debut broadcast's minimalist score bug, some viewers mocked it, and noted that the commentary team wandered off-topic and seemed to have a \"lack of enthusiasm for on-field events\". TechRadar wrote that viewers found that commentators didn't appear to understand the importance of the plays during the game. The outlet also praised the production technology used, noting that it utilized a Sony α7R IV, DJI Ronin-S, Phantom Camera, and a 1080p wireless transmitter allowing the game to be viewed at 60 frames per second, and that its use of narrow focus for some of the camera angles \"creates a recognizable cinematic effect … that instantly raises the drama.\"\nBefore the September 23 Yankees/Red Sox broadcast, where Aaron Judge of the Yankees would be attempting to tie an American League record with 61 home runs, New York State attorney general Letitia James urged Major League Baseball to allow the game to simulcast on the YES Network. The network is widely available on cable providers in New York State, which would have allowed the game to be more widely televised. Major League Baseball denied this request, and the game aired exclusively on Apple TV+ as planned. James was also criticized for advocating for a game that was made available to stream for free to also be made available on pay-TV services, when Amazon (who owns a stake in YES Network) were locking some Yankees games behind their Prime Video service in the team’s home market (Amazon would eventually allow the last game in their package that season to be simulcasted on YES Network)."

The Razorbacks played their home games in Barnhill Arena in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Arkansas competed in the Southwest Conference. It was Eddie Sutton's fifth season as head coach of the Razorbacks. The Razorbacks won a share of the Southwest Conference championship, going 13–3 in league play and finishing with an overall record of 25–5. Arkansas shared the league crown with Texas, whom they beat in the 1979 SWC tournament championship game to clinch a berth to the NCAA tournament. Arkansas earned the 2 seed in the tournament's Midwest region, receiving a first-round bye and advancing to the Elite Eight after beating Weber State in the second round and #13 Louisville in the Sweet Sixteen before losing to Larry Bird and #1 Indiana State in a controversial outcome after a missed tripping call late in the game.\n1979 was Arkansas's third consecutive and seventeenth overall SWC championship, as well as its second SWC Tournament championship. The run to the Elite Eight came as part of the Razorbacks' seventh appearance in the NCAA Tournament, also making the tournament the previous two seasons. 1979 was Sutton's third conference title with Arkansas out of the five he would eventually win in his tenure at Arkansas. Arkansas entered the polls at #20 on December 25, 1978, and would remain ranked the whole season, coming in at #5 in the final AP Poll for the second consecutive year. As the last remaining member of the famed \"Triplets\" following the departure of All-Americans and NBA Draft picks Ron Brewer and Marvin Delph, Sidney Moncrief was named an All-American for the second consecutive year and was drafted fifth overall by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1979 NBA draft, the highest pick in Arkansas history.

The match took place on 17 September 2006 at the Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton, Canada. It was contested between New Zealand and England for the second time in a row. It was England's fourth appearance in a Final and New Zealand's third. New Zealand won their third consecutive title after beating England 25–17.\nRoute to the final.\nThe pool stage of the 2006 World Cup was played in a cross-pool league system. Teams in Pool A competed against teams in Pool D, and Pool B teams competed against those in Pool C. New Zealand was in Pool A and played against Canada, Scotland and Samoa who were in Pool D. England was in Pool B and played France, the United States and South Africa from Pool C.\nNew Zealand played hosts, Canada, as they scored ten tries to begin their title defence. Canada only managed a converted try and couldn't stop the Black Ferns trouncing them 66–7. Samoa with their New Zealand based players were unsuccessful in scoring any points. Amiria Rule scored a hat-trick in the match as NewZealand scored 50 unanswered points. Scotland proved to be more resilient than Canada and Samoa as the Black Ferns were only able to score three tries. France were New Zealand's semifinal opponents and were defeated 40–10.\nEngland beat inaugural champions, the United States, in the opening round of the World Cup 18–0 and then overwhelmed the South Africans 74–8. England's last pool game was against France, they won 27–8. England came too close for comfort in their semifinal against Canada, they barely scrapped by with a 10–6 win.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nEngland dominated the first half of a tough match. English fly-half Karen Andrew scored the first points of the game after she successfully kicked a penalty in the third minute. New Zealand later equalized just before the 30th minute after a missed penalty earlier in the ninth. Two minutes before halftime Black Ferns Lock Monalisa Codling scored a try that put them in the lead 10–3 with a successful conversion from Scrum-half Emma Jensen. Stephanie Mortimer increased the Black Ferns lead to 15–3 with a try at the start of the second half. In the 49th minute England was awarded a penalty try and Karen Andrew's conversion brought them within five points of New Zealand, the score now 15–10. Victoria Heighway scored another try for the Black Ferns to make it 20–10. Helen Clayton scored England's last try and Shelley Rae converted it to bring the points to 20–17. Amiria Marsh's try sealed the deal for New Zealand as they celebrated their 25–17 victory and third World Cup title."

        "text": "The Statue of Napoleon in the Place du Général-de-Gaulle, Rouen, Normandy was erected in 1865. The equestrian statue was sculpted in bronze by Gabriel-Vital Dubray, and its pedestal was designed by Louis Desmarest. It stands in front of the city hall.\nIn 1881, during the Third French Republic, the city's administration saw the statue of the emperor as contrary to their values. There were plans to melt it into a new statue of an effigy of the republic, or to remove the man and leave only the horse; these plans did not come to fruition due to lack of funds.\nIn June 2020, the statue was taken down for repairs. Fractures in the hoof of the horse meant that it could have fallen down. A treasure chest of bronze, silver and gold coins of Napoleon III – Napoleon's nephew and reigning emperor at the time of inauguration – was found inside the pedestal. In September, mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol (Socialist) wished to replace it with a statue or work of art dedicated to the recently deceased feminist Gisèle Halimi. The plans were strongly opposed by the leader of the city's opposition, Jean-François Bures. Historian Thierry Lentz, director of the Fondation Napoléon, called the plans \"cancel culture\" and argued that Napoleon was a benefactor of Rouen, making him more locally relevant than Halimi. In December 2021, a survey of 4,080 residents found that 68% wanted the statue to remain, and the city council said it would respect the result.\nLater in December 2021, the statue was registered as a \"monument historique\"."

        "text": "The Minnesota–St. Cloud State men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey and St. Cloud State Huskies men's ice hockey programs. The first meeting between the two occurred on 3 October 1987 but wasn't played annually until 1990.\nHistory.\nWhile Minnesota and St. Cloud State both fielded varsity ice hockey teams since at least the early 1930s, the two programs never faced one another for over 50 years. Despite their campuses being just 65 miles apart, Minnesota was competing with the top tier colleges while St. Cloud were matched with the smaller schools. In the mid-80s, the administration at St. Cloud State decided to raise the profile of their college and hired legendary Gopher coach, Herb Brooks to head the team in 1986. He led the Huskies to their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance and, though he left for the NHL after the year, he set the program on the road to Division I play. The team was promoted to DI the following year and played their first game at that level against Minnesota. After a few years of playing as an independent, St. Cloud joined the WCHA in 1990 and the two programs became conference rivals.\nThe two played several times each season afterwards, with Minnesota carrying the balance of play for several years. Beginning in 1997, the two teams began facing one another with regularity in the conference playoffs. From '97 through '09, the Huskies and Gophers met nine times in the postseason. These frequent meeting had the effect of entrenching the rivalry between the two programs. After Minnesota and St. Cloud went their separate ways in 2013, the two were part of agreement to found the North Star College Cup, a Minnesota-based version of the Beanpot. The tournament didn't last long but both Minnesota and St. Cloud State continued their rivalry by scheduling one another in non-conference meeting more often than not.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

Anna Richards was sin-binned in the 22nd minute for killing the ball and was later joined by Mel Bosman 7 minutes later for the same offence, however England could not capitalize on the fact that New Zealand were down to 13 players. Winger Carla Hohepa eventually broke through the English defence and scored for the Black Ferns, a successful conversion by Kelly Brazier put them in the lead 7–0 at half-time.\nThree minutes into the second half Katy McLean kicked a penalty and reduced their deficit to 5 points. 13 minutes later Brazier kicked another penalty and increased New Zealand's lead to 10–3. New Zealand captain Melissa Ruscoe was sin-binned in the 57th minute, this time England took advantage of the Black Ferns misfortune as Charlotte Barras scored moments later and a conversion to Katy McLean leveled the game at 10–10. Kelly Brazier's penalty in the 66th minute helped New Zealand secure their fourth World title as they edged England 13–10."

        "title": "History of Major League Baseball on NBC",
        "text": "The following article details the history of \"Major League Baseball on NBC\", the broadcast of Major League Baseball games on the NBC television network.\nEarly years.\n1930s.\nNBC television's relationship with Major League Baseball technically dates back to August 26, 1939. It was on that date that on W2XBS (an experimental television station in New York City which would ultimately become what is now NBC's flagship television station, WNBC), the first-ever Major League Baseball game was televised. With Red Barber announcing, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds played a doubleheader at Ebbets Field. The Reds won the first game 5–2 while the Dodgers won the second, 6–1. Barber called the game without the benefit of a monitor and with only two cameras capturing the game. One camera was on Barber and the other was behind the plate. Barber had to guess from which light was on and where it pointed.\n1940s.\nBy 1947, television sets, most with five and seven-inch screens, were selling almost as fast as they could be produced. Because of this, Major League teams began televising games and attracted a whole new audience into ballparks in the process. People who had only casually followed baseball began going to the games in person. In 1948, Major League Baseball's total attendance reached a record high of 21 million.\n1947 also saw the first televised World Series. The games were broadcast in the New York City area by NBC's WNBT, CBS's WCBS-TV and DuMont's WABD and sponsored by Gillette and Ford. The 1947 World Series brought in an estimated 3.9 million viewers, becoming television's first mass audience. In addition to New York City, live coverage of the Series was also seen on WRGB in Schenectady/Albany (now a CBS affiliate), WPTZ (now CBS-owned KYW-TV) in Philadelphia, WMAR-TV in Baltimore and WTTG in Washington, D.C.\nIn 1948 and 1949, the World Series would be carried on the aforementioned stations, as well as on WBZ-TV and WNAC-TV (now WHDH-TV) in Boston, WNHC-TV (now WTNH) in New Haven and WTVR-TV in Richmond, Virginia. In 1949, the World Series was also seen live in other Northeastern and Midwestern cities (Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Erie, Cleveland, Detroit, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo, Indianapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Louis) that had been hooked up to network lines over the previous year.\n1950s.\nIn 1950, the Mutual Broadcasting System acquired the television as well as radio broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in dreams of becoming a television network or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.\nBy , World Series games could be seen in most of the country, but not all. 1950 also marked the first time that there was an exclusive network television broadcaster (NBC). West Coast viewers finally saw live major league games on television during the 1951 postseason.\nNBC aired the second and third games of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, necessitated by the teams' finishing the regular season in a tie for first place. The three-game pennant playoff, which featured the first baseball games televised live from coast to coast (with CBS airing the first game), culminated on October 3 when the Giants won the third and deciding game by the score of 5–4 (off Bobby Thomson's home run). Ernie Harwell called the game for Giants television flagship WPIX – the independent station's broadcast was simulcast nationally by NBC – and his description of the home run was a simple shout of \"It's gone!\" almost at the moment Thomson's bat struck Ralph Branca's pitch. Harwell later admitted he had probably called it \"too soon\", but fortunately for him, the call proved to be correct. \"And then\", Harwell recalled, \"the pictures took over.\"\nThe 1951 playoff between Brooklyn and the New York Giants and that year's World Series were the first major league baseball games telecast live from coast-to-coast to coast; transcontinental network transmission lines had been completed and activated in September, in-time for the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco and the start of the 1951–52 television season.\nThe 1952 All-Star Game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia was the first nationally televised All-Star Game, but it was shortened due to rain.\nOn January 31, 1953, the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox joined forces against St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. The respective franchises tried to force the Browns to play afternoon games in an attempt to avoid having to share television revenues. A month later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about nationally televising their games. Johnson's theory was that nationally televising baseball games would be a threat to the survival of minor league baseball. The owners ignored Johnson, as the games on NBC were gaining a large and loyal following.\nAnother first for NBC during this period was the first color telecast of a World Series, the 1955 matchup between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees.\nChicago White Sox announcer Bob Elson missed a chance to call the 1959 World Series – the White Sox' first since 1919, and Elson's first since 1943 – on NBC because the then head of NBC Sports, Tom Gallery (who incidentally, grew up on the same block as Elson) did not like him. Elson was, however, allowed to call the Series on the White Sox' radio flagship, WCFL.\nNBC begins airing the \"Game of the Week\" (1957–65).\nIn 1957, NBC started airing weekend \"Game of the Week\" telecasts (Sunday telecasts were added in 1959) with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher calling the action. During this period, NBC (as rival CBS had the rights to broadcast at least eight teams) typically broadcast from Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Chicago's Wrigley Field or Milwaukee's County Stadium. NBC purchased the rights to 11 Milwaukee Braves games, 11 Pittsburgh Pirates games, two Washington Senators games, and two Chicago Cubs games. Leo Durocher was succeeded as color commentator by Fred Haney in 1960, and Joe Garagiola in 1961, while Bob Wolff replaced Nelson on play-by-play in 1962.\nFrom 1958 to 1960, NBC aired a special regional feed of its games in the southeast, where the network had a different sponsor (such as National Bohemian beer) than for the rest of the country. This feed featured its own announcing team, with Chuck Thompson calling the games with Bill Veeck (1958) and Al Rosen (1959–60). NBC never had a true backup game until 1966, when the network got exclusivity for the \"Game of the Week\". In the process, NBC brought in Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese for the primary game, and Jim Simpson and Tony Kubek for the alternate game (which was always shown in the markets of teams playing in the primary game).\n1960–65.\nAs previously mentioned, in 1961, NBC hired Joe Garagiola to be their Major League Baseball color commentator. The following year, Bob Wolff began working play-by-play. \"You work your side of the street [interviewing players]\", said Garagiola to Wolff \"and I'll work mine.\" Wolff liked Garagiola's pizazz as he would say things like \"the guy stapled him to the bag\" or that a runner is \"smilin' like he swallowed a banana peel.\" Also in 1962, NBC broadcast the National League tie-breaker series between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Bob Wolff and George Kell were the announcers for the playoff series. Wolff also hosted the pre-game shows for NBC's World Series coverage from 1962 to 1965.\nPrior to the mid-1970s, television networks and stations generally did not preserve telecasts of sporting events, choosing instead to tape over them. As a result, the broadcasts of six of the seven 1960 World Series games are no longer known to exist. The lone exception is a black-and-white kinescope of the entire telecast of Game 7, which was discovered in a wine cellar in Bing Crosby's home in Hillsborough, California in December 2009. A part-owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who was too superstitious to watch the Series live, Crosby listened to the decisive contest with his wife Kathryn and two friends on a shortwave radio in Paris, France. Wanting to watch the game at a later date only if the Pirates won, he arranged for a company to record it. After viewing the kinescope, he placed it in his wine cellar, where it went untouched for 49 years. It was finally found by Robert Bader, vice president of marketing and production for Bing Crosby Enterprises, while looking through videotapes of Crosby's television specials which were to be transferred to DVD. The five-reel set is the only known complete copy of the historic match, which was originally broadcast in color. The NBC television announcers for the Series were Bob Prince and Mel Allen, the respective primary play-by-play voices for the Pirates and New York Yankees. Prince called the first half of Game 7, while Allen did the latter portion.\nIn contrast to preceding years, where NBC's World Series telecasts featured two announcers (usually one from each participating team) who split the play-by-play duties, each working his portion of the game by himself, in 1961, the network had Yankees announcer Mel Allen handle all of the play-by-play on television (with Reds announcer Waite Hoyt confined to radio) while Joe Garagiola provided color commentary. This format would eventually become the standard form of presentation on World Series telecasts. In Week 3 of the 1961 National Football League season, the Baltimore-Green Bay game was televised locally to Baltimore on WBAL 11, an NBC affiliate. Apparently if Baltimore viewers wanted to see the World Series, they would have had to choose between WRC 4 in Washington or WGAL 8 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There was no NFL telecast on NBC (who at the time broadcast Pittsburgh Steelers and Colts games) due to coverage of Game 4 of the World Series.\nOn July 13, 1963, NBC's coverage of the Detroit Tigers–Chicago White Sox game from Comiskey Park in Chicago was carried by KCRA-TV in Sacramento, KCRL in Reno and KVIP-TV in Redding – however it was not televised in the San Francisco market on KRON-TV. NBC's coverage of the Cleveland Indians-Tigers game at 11:30 a.m. the following day was also not broadcast by KRON.\nDuring the fourth and final game of the World Series, Yankees announcer Mel Allen was calling the top of the ninth inning for NBC when his voice gave out due to a bout of severe laryngitis, forcing Dodgers announcer Vin Scully (who had called the first four-and-a-half innings of the game per the network's usual setup) to resume play-by-play duties for the remainder of the game. After the Series \"New York Daily News\" sportswriter Dick Young opined that Allen, the voice of the Yankees, had been stricken by \"psychosomatic laryngitis\" caused by his team being swept.\nBy 1964, CBS' Dizzy Dean and Pee Wee Reese called games from Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Baltimore. New York got a US$550,000 payment of CBS' $895,000. Meanwhile, six clubs that exclusively played nationally televised games on NBC were paid $1.2 million.\nAlso in 1964, the New York Yankees made the World Series for the 15th time in 18 years – however Mel Allen was not there. In September of that year, before the end of the season, the Yankees informed Allen that his contract with the team would not be renewed. In those days, the main announcers for the Series participants always called the World Series on NBC. Although Allen was therefore technically eligible to call the Series, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick honored the Yankees' request to have Phil Rizzuto join the Series crew instead. It was the first time Allen had missed a World Series for which the Yankees were eligible since 1943, and only the second World Series (not counting those missed during World War II) that he had missed since he began calling baseball games in 1938. On December 17, after much media speculation and many letters to the Yankees from fans disgruntled at Allen's absence from the Series, the Yankees issued a terse press release announcing Allen's firing; he was replaced by Joe Garagiola. NBC and Movietone dropped him soon afterward.\nTo this day, the Yankees have never given an explanation for Allen's sudden firing, and rumors abounded. Depending on the rumor, Allen was either homosexual, an alcoholic, a drug addict or had a nervous breakdown. Allen's sexuality was sometimes a target in those more conservative days because he had not married (and never did). Years later, Allen told author Curt Smith that the Yankees had fired him under pressure from the team's longtime sponsor, Ballantine Beer. According to Allen, he was fired as a cost-cutting move by Ballantine, which had been experiencing poor sales for years (it would eventually be sold in 1969). Smith, in his book \"Voices of Summer\", also indicated that the medications Allen took in order to maintain his busy schedule may have affected his on-air performance (Stephen Borelli, another biographer, has also pointed out that Allen's heavy workload did not allow him time to take care of his health).\nIn 1965, ABC brought forth such innovations like isolated instant replay, field microphones, and a separate camera for each base runner. After ABC's contract for the \"Game of the Week\" expired after a single season, NBC felt compelled to dramatically alter their own baseball coverage. So for NBC's coverage of the 1965 World Series, it featured videotaped replays, prerecorded audio analysis from key players, and enhanced animated graphics.\nThe \"Game of the Week\" exclusivity era (1966–89).\nUntil 1965 (when Major League Baseball made its first ever, league-wide regular-season network television deal with ABC), there was no league-wide national television package for regular season Major League Baseball games. As a result, teams, if they so desired, could sell the rights to the networks. Also prior to 1965, regular season Major League Baseball telecasts broadcast by networks had to be blacked-out in cities with league franchises. More to the point, by around the year prior, thanks to expansion (in 1960 and 1961), regular season MLB games shown on network television were blacked out in most major markets. However, the network \"Games of the Week\", up until the late 1980s, still could not be seen in the two cities whose local teams were playing in each respective game.\nFrom 1965 until the late 1980s, networks would cover two Saturday afternoon games each week: one that went to most of the network (a \"primary game\"), and the second being seen only in the home markets of the two teams playing in the network's \"primary\" game. Although the \"primary\" game would not be televised in each team's home markets, local television rights-holders in those cities were free to broadcast that game. The manner that this worked allowed, for instance, a network's two Saturday afternoon \"Games of the Week\" involving the New York Yankees at the Boston Red Sox serving as the primary game and St. Louis Cardinals at the Chicago Cubs being the secondary game. The Yankees-Red Sox game would as a result, be seen everywhere except in New York City, Boston and possibly markets adjacent to those cities. Ultimately, those markets got the Cardinals-Cubs game instead.\n1960s.\nThe New York Yankees, which, the year before, had played 21 \"Games of the Week\" for CBS, joined NBC's package in 1966. The new package under NBC called for 28 games, as compared to the 123 combined among three networks during the 1960s. On October 19, 1966, NBC signed a three-year contract with Major League Baseball. As previously mentioned, the year before, Major League Baseball sold an exclusive league-wide television package for the rights to the Saturday-Sunday \"Game of the Week\" to ABC. NBC covered only the All-Star Game and World Series in 1965. In addition, a previous deal limited CBS to covering only twelve weekends when its new subsidiary, the New York Yankees, played at home. As previously mentioned, before 1965, NBC aired a slate of Saturday afternoon games beginning in 1957.\nUnder the new deal, NBC paid roughly US$6 million per year for the 25 \"Games of the Week\", $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts such as a Labor Day 1966 contest between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers) up to $30.6 million.\nOn April 16, 1966, in New York City, about 50 baseball, network, and advertising officials discussed NBC's first year with the \"Game of the Week\". New York could not get a primary match-up between the Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees with Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese calling the action because of local blackout rules. Instead, that market received a backup game (or \"'B' game\") featuring Tony Kubek and Jim Simpson calling a game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. That rule would be eliminated after the 1983 season.\nIn replacing CBS, NBC traded a circus for a seminar. Reese said \"Curt Gowdy was its guy (1966–75), and didn't want Dizzy Dean – too overpowering. Curt was nice, but worried about mistakes. Diz and I just laughed.\" Falstaff Brewery hyped Dean as Gowdy in return said \"I said, 'I can't do \"Wabash Cannonball.\" Our styles clash --\" then came Pee Wee Reese. Gowdy added by saying about the pairing between him and Reese, \"They figured he was fine with me, and they'd still have their boy.\" To many, baseball meant CBS's 1955–64 \"Game of the Week\" thoroughbred. A year later, NBC bought ABC's variant of a mule so to speak. \"We had the Series and All-Star Game. 1966–1968's \"Game\" meant exclusivity\", said NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann, who added that \"[Colleague] Chet Simmons and liked him [Gowdy] with the Sox and football\" also, getting two network sports for the price of one. As his analyst, Gowdy wanted his friend Ted Williams. NBC's lead sponsor, Chrysler declined the idea when Williams, a Sears spokesman, was pictured putting stuff in a Ford truck.\nBefore 1966, local announcers exclusively called the World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent each of the teams that were in the World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said \"What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me.\" In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4½ innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word.\nAs previously mentioned, before , NBC typically paired the top announcers for the respective World Series teams to alternate play-by-play during each game's telecast. For example, if the Yankees played the Dodgers in the World Series, Mel Allen (representing the Yankees) would call half the game and Vin Scully (representing the Dodgers) would call the rest of the game. However, in 1966, NBC wanted its regular network announcer, Curt Gowdy, to call most of the play-by-play at the expense of the top local announcers. So instead of calling half of every World Series game on television (as Vin Scully had done in , , , , and ) they only get to call half of all home games on TV, providing color commentary while Gowdy called play-by-play for the rest each game. The visiting teams' announcers participated in the NBC Radio broadcasts. In broadcasts of Series-clinching (or potentially Series-clinching) games on both media, NBC sent the announcer for whichever team was ahead in the game to that team's clubhouse in the ninth inning in order to help cover the trophy presentation and conduct postgame interviews.\nIn 1967, main \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts were blacked-out in the cities of the two participating teams. In some cases, those games were aired by way of the teams' respective local flagship stations, with their local announcing crews – for example, the May 27, Dodgers–Giants contest in San Francisco was not carried by either KRON-TV in the originating city or KNBC in Los Angeles. The game was, however, telecast in Los Angeles over the Dodgers' flagship station KTTV, with Jerry Doggett and Vin Scully providing play-by-play. At the time, Dodgers' broadcasts over KTTV were limited to road games in San Francisco. Conversely the Giants' broadcast partner, KTVU, did not broadcast the team's home games in 1967. Viewers in the San Francisco Bay Area may have been able to view this game on one of two NBC affiliates from nearby areas, KSBW-TV in Salinas and KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California.\nThe 1967 All-Star Game in Anaheim can be considered the first \"prime time\" telecast of a Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game started at approximately 7:00 p.m. on the East Coast. \"Sports Illustrated\", noting that the game \"began at 4 p.m. in California and ended at 11 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,\" reported \"an estimated 55 million people watched the game, compared with 12 million viewers for the 1966 All-Star Game, played in the afternoon.\" Buddy Blattner, broadcaster for the host California Angels, appeared briefly at the beginning of the NBC telecast to introduce viewers to Anaheim Stadium before moving to the NBC Radio booth for the game itself. Houston Astros announcer Gene Elston was used in the same role for the 1968 game at the Astrodome.\nWeek 4 of the 1967 AFL season coincided with the race for the American League pennant. NBC decided to focus on their baseball coverage instead of covering the early games; thus resulting in Curt Gowdy calling the Twins-Red Sox game; Jim Simpson calling the Angels-Tigers game); while the AFL schedule resulted in the two early games (Broncos-Oilers and Dolphins-Jets) not being televised with another Chargers-Bills game being a locally televised game airing only in San Diego on then-NBC affiliate KOGO (now ABC affiliate KGTV).\nThe June 8, 1968 \"Game of the Week\" broadcast was cancelled due to coverage of the funeral/burial of Robert F. Kennedy. Cleveland at Detroit and Atlanta at Chicago Cubs were the games scheduled to air on that date.\nTony Kubek initially had trouble adjusting to the world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Curt Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek \"He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth.\"\nThe 1969 All-Star Game was originally scheduled for the evening of Tuesday, July 22, but heavy rains forced its postponement to the following afternoon. The 1969 contest remains the last All-Star Game to date to be played earlier than prime time in the Eastern United States. Charlie Jones served as an \"in-the-stands\" reporter for NBC's coverage.\nGames 3, 4, and 5 of the 1969 World Series are believed to be the oldest surviving color television broadcasts of World Series games (even though World Series telecasts have aired in color since ). However, they were \"truck feeds\" in that they do not contain the original commercials, but show a static image of the Shea Stadium field between innings. Games 1 and 2 were saved only as black-and-white kinescopes provided by the CBC. CBC also preserved all seven games of the and 1968 World Series (plus the 1968 All-Star Game) in black-and-white kinescope.\n1970s.\n1970–75.\nIn 1970, NBC televised the second games of both League Championship Series on a regional basis. Some markets received the NLCS at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time along with a 4:00 p.m. football game, while other markets got the ALCS at 4:00 p.m. along with a 1:00 p.m. football game.\nIn 1967, soon after his retirement as a player, Sandy Koufax signed a ten-year contract with NBC for $1 million to serve as a broadcaster on the \"Saturday Game of the Week\". Koufax never felt comfortable being in front of the camera, and quit before the 1973 season.\nAlso in 1971, Game 1 of the ALCS was rained out on Saturday, October 2. NBC did not televise the rescheduled Game 1 the following day (the network had only planned an NLCS telecast that day), but added a telecast of Game 2 on Monday, October 4 (which had been a scheduled travel day). 1971 was the first year that the League Championship Series schedule contained travel days. Back then, for the most part, Major League Baseball did this whenever a west coast team (in this case, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) was involved.\nOn October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for the very first time. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who felt that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, occurring when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; television ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number.\nFor World Series night games, NBC normally began baseball coverage at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time with a pre-game show (with first pitch occurring around 8:20 to 8:25 p.m.). However, in 1986 and 1988, for Game 5 of the World Series (on Thursday night), NBC's coverage did not begin until 8:30. This allowed the network to air its highly rated sitcom \"The Cosby Show\" in its normal Thursday 8:00 p.m. timeslot. NBC went with carrying a very short pre-game show and got to first pitch at around 8:40 p.m. Eastern Time.\nIn the early years of the League Championship Series, NBC typically televised a doubleheader on Saturday, a single game on Sunday (because of football coverage). At the time, the network covered the weekday games with a 1½-hour overlap, joining the second game in progress when the first one ended (unless a rain delay caused the second game to start after the first game ended, as was the case during the 1972 NLCS, when the Pirates-Reds Game 5 was delayed long enough that by the time that the A's-Tigers ALCS Game 4 was over, NBC could join the game in time for the first pitch.). NBC usually swapped announcer crews after Game 2.\nNBC did not air Game 2 of the 1972 NLCS or the 1974 NLCS.\nExcept for Game 1 in both League Championship Series, all games in 1975 were regionally televised. Game 3 of both League Championship Series were aired in prime time, the first time such an occurrence happened.\n\"Monday Night Baseball\" (1972–75).\nIn , NBC began televising prime time regular-season games on Mondays, under a four-year contract worth $72 million. During the previous two seasons, the network had shown a limited number of Monday night games, with three in and five in , in addition to the All-Star games (on Tuesday night in July). In , NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to fifteen consecutive games. NBC's last \"Monday Night Baseball\" game aired on September 1, , in which the Montréal Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6–5. Curt Gowdy called the games with Tony Kubek from 1972 to 1974, being joined in the 1973 and seasons by various guest commentators from both within and outside of the baseball world (among them Dizzy Dean, Joe DiMaggio, Satchel Paige, Bobby Riggs, Dave DeBusschere, Howard Cosell, Mel Allen, Danny Kaye, and Willie Mays), while Jim Simpson and Maury Wills called the secondary backup games. Joe Garagiola hosted the pre-game show, \"The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola\", and teamed with Gowdy to call the games in 1975.\nDuring NBC's telecast of the Monday night Dodgers–Braves game on April 8, 1974, in which Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th career home run, Kubek criticized Commissioner Bowie Kuhn on-air for failing to be in attendance at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta on that historic night; Kuhn argued that he had a prior engagement that he could not break.\nJoe Garagiola replaces Curt Gowdy.\nStarting in 1975, Joe Garagiola and Curt Gowdy alternated as the Saturday \"Game of Week\" play-by-play announcers with Tony Kubek doing color analysis. Then on weeks in which NBC had \"Monday Night Baseball\", Gowdy and Garagiola worked together. One would call play-by-play for 4½ innings, the other would handle color analysis. Then in the bottom of the 5th inning, their roles switched. Ultimately, in November 1975, Chrysler forced NBC to totally remove Curt Gowdy from NBC's top baseball team. Instead, the company wanted their spokesman, Joe Garagiola, to call all the main regular season games, All-Star Games (when NBC had them), the top League Championship Series (when NBC had it), and the World Series (when NBC had it).\nNBC hoped that, in replacing Curt Gowdy, Joe Garagiola's charm and unorthodox dwelling on the personal would stop the decade-long ratings dive for the \"Game of the Week\". Instead, the ratings bobbed from 6.7 (1977) via 7.5 (1978) to 6.3 (1981–82). \"Saturday had a constituency, but it didn't swell\" said NBC Sports executive producer Scotty Connal. Some believed that millions missed Dizzy Dean while local-team television broadcasters split the audience. Scotty Connal believed that the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek were \"A great example of black and white\". Connal added by saying \"A pitcher throws badly to third, Joe says, 'The third baseman's fault.' Tony: 'The pitcher's'.\" Media critic Gary Deeb termed theirs \"the finest baseball commentary ever carried on network TV.\"\nAnother factor behind Gowdy's dismissal was the criticism from the national media which alleged that he sided with the Boston Red Sox (a franchise that he had covered prior to his days at NBC) on a controversial play in the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World Series. Cincinnati Reds pinch hitter Ed Armbrister reached base on what was ruled an error by Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk on Armbrister's bunt attempt. Gowdy said numerous times that, in his opinion, Armbrister had interfered with Fisk. Gowdy had been given the correct interpretation by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott (who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use it. Umpire Larry Barnett claimed he had received death threats on account of Gowdy's criticism. More to the point, Tony Kubek, on the NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the attempted forceout), even though home plate umpire Barnett did not agree. Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. Prior to Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett declared, \"You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the right call.\" Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the \"same kind of mentality that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress.\"\nWhile Gowdy was on hand in the press box for Carlton Fisk's legendary home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, the actual calls went to two of Gowdy's Red Sox successors, Dick Stockton on television and Ned Martin on radio. Gowdy was Martin's color commentator on that home run. Stockton on NBC stayed silent as Fisk rounded the bases, waiting until he made his way into the Red Sox dugout before proclaiming: \"We will have a seventh game in this 1975 World Series.\" Meanwhile, according to the NBC cameraman Lou Gerard located above the third base stands, cameramen at the time were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. Instead Gerard was distracted by a rat nearby, thus he lost track of the baseball and instead decided to capture the image of Fisk \"magically\" waving the ball fair.\n1976–79.\nFor Game 2 of the 1976 World Series, NBC and Major League Baseball experimented with a Sunday night telecast.\nOn June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.\nThe 1977 postseason schedule started on Tuesday after starting on Saturday from 1969 to 1976. Major League Baseball began a pattern where one League Championship Series started on Tuesday and contained an off-day while the other LCS started on Wednesday with no off-day. NBC used three different announcer crews (Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek, Jim Simpson and Maury Wills, and Dick Enberg and Don Drysdale) on the 1977 LCS.\nAfter being replaced full-time by Joe Garagiola as the lead play-by-play man, NBC used Curt Gowdy in a hosting role for their coverage of the 1978 World Series.\nOn July 7, 1979, WMC 5 in Memphis, Tennessee aired a local Memphis wrestling program featuring Jerry \"The King\" Lawler instead of NBC's baseball telecast between the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers.\nAlternating coverage with ABC (1976–79).\nUnder the initial agreement with ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball (running through the 1976 to 1979 seasons), both networks paid $92.8 million for the league broadcast rights. ABC paid $12.5 million per year to show 16 Monday night games in 1976, 18 in the next three years, plus half the postseason (the League Championship Series in even-numbered years and World Series in odd-numbered years). NBC paid $10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday \"Games of the Week\" and the other half of the postseason (the League Championship Series in odd-numbered years and World Series in even-numbered years).\nMajor League Baseball media director John Lazarus said of the new arrangement between NBC and ABC \"Ratings couldn't get more from one network so we approached another.\" NBC's Joe Garagiola was not very fond of the new broadcasting arrangement at first saying \"I wished they hadn't got half the package. Still, 'Game', half of the postseason – we got lots left.\" By 1980, income from television broadcasts accounted for a record 30% of the game's $500 million in revenues.\nMichael Weisman became NBC's coordinating producer for baseball in 1979, where he learned baseball production from Harry Coyle, whom Weisman calls his idol and mentor. Weisman became the executive producer of NBC Sports in 1982. In baseball, Weisman introduced split-screen baseball coverage, which allowed fans to watch two games simultaneously. Weisman also was among the first producers to have baseball players introduce their team lineups, which helped personalize the game for viewers.\n1980s.\n1980–82.\nOn October 4, 1980, Bob Costas made his debut calling baseball games for NBC. It was a backup game (the primary game involved the Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal Expos) involving the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers from Yankee Stadium.\nThe 1980 World Series is tied with the 1978 Series for having the highest overall television ratings for a World Series to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. Although Bryant Gumbel anchored NBC's pregame coverage for Game 5 of the 1980 World Series, he was not present at Royals Stadium in Kansas City. Game 5 was scheduled on a Sunday, which conflicted with Gumbel's hosting duties for the network's NFL pre-game show \"NFL '80\". As a result, Gumbel had to anchor the World Series coverage from the NBC Studios in New York City. Gumbel, however, would be present at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia for Game 6, which turned out to be the clincher for the Phillies.\nDuring the 1981 players' strike, NBC used its Saturday \"Game of the Week\" time-slot to show a 20-minute strike update, followed by a sports anthology series hosted by Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce) called \"NBC Sports: The Summer Season\".\nAs a means to recoup revenue lost during the 1981 players' strike, Major League Baseball set up a special additional playoff round (as a prelude to the League Championship Series). ABC televised the American League Division Series while NBC televised the National League Division Series. The Division Series round would not be officially instituted until 14 years later. Games 1, 3, and 5 of the Phillies/Expos series and Games 2, 3, and 5 of the Dodgers/Astros series were regionally televised.\nEven though Dick Enberg did play-by-play for the 1981 NLCS for NBC (working alongside Tom Seaver), Merle Harmon was, for the most part, NBC's backup baseball play-by-play announcer (serving behind Joe Garagiola, who called that year's ALCS for NBC with Tony Kubek) in 1981. Harmon's broadcast partner during this period was Ron Luciano. In late 1979, Harmon left the Milwaukee Brewers completely in favor of a multi-year pact with NBC. Harmon saw the NBC deal as a perfect opportunity since according to \"The Milwaukee Journal\" he would make more money, get more exposure, and do less traveling. At NBC, Harmon did \"SportsWorld\", the backup \"Game of the Week\", and served as a field reporter for the 1980 World Series. Most of all, Harmon had hoped to cover the American-boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics from Moscow. After NBC pulled out of their scheduled coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics, Harmon considered it to be \"a great letdown.\" To add insult to injury, NBC fired Harmon in 1982 in favor of Bob Costas. It was in 1982 that Costas started working the NBC backup games on a full-time basis, with former Oakland A's third baseman Sal Bando as his color man.\nOn June 26, 1982, before the bottom of the 9th inning of NBC's \"Game of the Week\" between Boston and Milwaukee the power went out at Fenway Park. All television equipment stopped functioning except for one camera and the intercom. The director of the telecast, Harry Coyle, who had previously directed 36 World Series broadcasts for NBC, told the lone cameraman, Mario, \"We'll show 'em what one cameraman can do!\" and proceeded to direct the final inning of the game with just a single camera and zoom lens, located above home plate — including a near-comeback by the Red Sox, who before the start of the inning, were down 11–8.\nAccording to his autobiography, \"Oh My\", Dick Enberg (then the lead play-by-play voice for \"The NFL on NBC\") was informed by NBC that he would become the lead play-by-play voice of the \"Major League Baseball Game of the Week\" beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for those games with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of \"The Sporting News\" to make sure he was current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and began with the network in the spring of 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he loved being the Los Angeles Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer.\nTom Seaver provided periodic commentary during the 1982 World Series, but was not in the booth. As previously mentioned, Dick Enberg and Joe Garagiola traded off play-by-play duties (just as Tony Kubek had done with Garagiola in NBC's previous World Series broadcasts) for NBC's coverage in 1982. Garagiola called the first three and last three innings. Enberg, meanwhile, hosted the pregame show and then called the middle innings.\nA Canadian Football League game between the Edmonton Eskimos at the Winnipeg Blue Bombers was tentatively scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday October 17, even making newspaper TV listings. At the last moment NBC, who was using the CFL as substitute programming during the 1982 players strike, cancelled the broadcast. The network was worried that the game would run over its allotted time and conflict with Game 5 of the World Series, which was supposed to begin at 4:30.\nAlternating coverage with ABC (1983–89).\nOn April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball agreed to terms with ABC and NBC on a six-year television package, worth $1.2 billion. The two networks would continue to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even-numbered years and NBC in odd-numbered years), World Series (ABC would televise the World Series in odd-numbered years and NBC in even-numbered years) and All-Star Game (ABC would televise the All-Star Game in even-numbered years and NBC in odd-numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return (even if no fans showed up). This was a substantial increase over the last package, in which each club was being paid $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for the rights to televise prime time and Sunday afternoon regular season games and NBC paid $550 million for the rights to broadcast 30 Saturday afternoon games.\nUSA Network's coverage became a casualty of the new $1.2 billion television contract between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC. One of the provisions to the new deal was that local telecasts that aired opposite network games had to be eliminated.\nThrough the deal, the two networks paid $20 million in advance for the season; both networks paid a total of $126 million in (NBC $70 million and ABC $56 million). For the season, the rights fee totaled $136 million (with NBC paying $61 million and ABC paying $75 million), although the networks got $9 million when Major League Baseball expanded the League Championship Series from a best-of-five to a best-of-seven in 1985. The total rights fee increased to $141 million for (NBC $75 million, ABC $66 million), $171 million for (NBC $81 million, ABC $90 million) and then to $186 million for the (NBC $90 million, ABC $96 million). For the final year of the contract in , NBC paid a fee of $106 million and ABC paid $125 million to the league, with the total rising to $231 million.\nNBC also would normally televise two prime time games during the regular season (not including All-Star Games). Generally, NBC would broadcast one game on a Tuesday and the other on a Friday. They however, would have to compete against local teams' over-the-air broadcasts, putting NBC at risk of hampering its ratings.\nMemorable moments.\n\"The New York Times\" observed the performance of the team of Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola by saying \"That the duo of Scully and Garagiola is very good, and often even great, is no longer in dispute.\" A friend of Garagiola's said \"he understood the cash\" concerning 407% hike in Major League Baseball fees paid by NBC for the 1984–89 contract. At this point the idea was basically summarized as Vin Scully \"being the star\", whereas Joe Garagiola was Pegasus or NBC's junior light. When NBC inked a six-year, $550 million contract in the fall of 1982, a return on the investment, so to speak, demanded that Vin Scully be their star baseball announcer. NBC Sports head Thomas Watson said about Scully, \"He is baseball's best announcer. Why shouldn't he be ours?\" Dick Enberg mused \"No room for me. 'Game' had enough for two teams a week.\" Henry Hecht once wrote \"NBC's Curt Gowdy, Tony Kubek, and Monte Moore sounded like college radio rejects vs. Scully.\" Vin Scully earned approximately $2 million per year for his NBC baseball broadcasting duties.\nBesides calling the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" for NBC, Scully called three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988), four National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and four All-Star Games (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home games on the radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC.\nScully was on hand for several key moments in baseball history: Fred Lynn hitting the first grand slam in All-Star Game history (1983); the 1984 Detroit Tigers winning the World Series (along the way, Scully called Tigers pitcher Jack Morris' no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on April 7); Ozzie Smith's game-winning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series; the New York Mets' miracle rally in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series; the 1987 All-Star Game in Oakland, which was deadlocked at 0–0 before Tim Raines broke up the scoreless tie with a triple in the top of the 13th inning; the first official night game in the history of Chicago's Wrigley Field (August 9, 1988); Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series; and chatting with former President of the United States Ronald Reagan (who said to Scully, \"I've been out of work for six months and maybe there's a future here.\") in the booth during the 1989 All-Star Game in Anaheim as Bo Jackson hit a lead off home-run.\nWhen Tony Kubek first teamed with Bob Costas in 1983, Kubek said \"I'm not crazy about being assigned to the backup game, but it's no big ego deal.\" Costas said about working with Kubek \"I think my humor loosened Tony, and his knowledge improved me.\" The team of Costas and Kubek proved to be a formidable pair. There were even some who preferred the team of Kubek and Costas over the musings of Vin Scully and the asides of Joe Garagiola. Costas was praised by fans for both his reverence and irreverence while Kubek was praised for his technical approach and historical perspective.\nFor the 1983 season, NBC introduced a wraparound studio show (airing for about 15 minutes) co-hosted by Bill Macatee and Mike Adamle called \"30 Rock\" (a reference to the New York City skyscraper that housed NBC's headquarters). The show would offer sports news, highlights and feature reports from Len Berman. It would actually handle breaking news as well. NBC canceled the \"30 Rock\" pregame show after one year. It was also used to wraparound college basketball games, golf, and \"NBC SportsWorld\". 1983 was also the last season that the old blackout restrictions were in place. Thus, Vin Scully's first \"Game of the Week\" telecast (Montreal at Los Angeles on April 9) did not air in Los Angeles.\nFor NBC's coverage of the 1983 All-Star Game in Chicago, Don Sutton was in New York, periodically tracking pitches with the aid of NBC's \"Inside Pitch\" technology. Sutton also served as an analyst alongside host Bill Macatee for NBC's coverage of the 1983 American League Championship Series. Meanwhile, Len Berman hosted NBC's coverage of the 1983 National League Championship Series alongside Tom Seaver.\n1984 was the first year that the \"Game of the Week\" was not subject to blackout. NBC and ABC generally still aired two games each week, with a primary game carried to most of the country and a secondary game to mostly the markets that would carry that game. This was mostly done for insurance in the event that a game was rained out. During the 1970s and early 1980s, many of the \"rainout insurance\" games involved the Houston Astros since that team played in a domed ballpark. Therefore, if the Astros were at home on a given Saturday or Monday night, then it was a safe bet that the game would be shown on network television, due to the Astros being the only \"dome\" team (until the Seattle Mariners began play in the Kingdome in 1977).\nDuring the 1984 regular season, the reason for most of the changes from the traditional 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time start was because of NBC's golf or tennis commitments as well as September 1 title fight featuring Eusebio Pedroza.\nBob Costas and Tony Kubek were the announcers on the \"Sandberg Game\" on June 23, 1984, from Chicago's Wrigley Field. In that game, Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg hit two crucial, game tying home runs off of St. Louis Cardinals closer Bruce Sutter in both the bottom of the ninth and tenth innings. The Cubs would ultimately go on to win the game in eleven innings, by the score of 12–11. Bob Costas considered the \"Game of the Week\" his dream job saying \"You can put a personal stamp on a baseball broadcast, be a reporter, something of a historian, a storyteller, conversationalist, dispenser of opinion.\"\nAs champions of the National League, the San Diego Padres had home-field advantage (at the time, the NL automatically gained home-field advantage in even years of the World Series) during the 1984 World Series. However, had the Chicago Cubs won the National League Championship Series (which appeared likely after the Cubs took a 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series), the Detroit Tigers would have gained home-field advantage despite the fact the American League's Baltimore Orioles had it the season before. NBC was contractually obligated to show all mid-week series games in prime time, something that would have been impossible at Wrigley Field, since the Cubs' venerable facility lacked lights at the time (they would not install lights until four years later). Had the Cubs advanced to the Series, Detroit would have hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 (on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30 p.m. Central Time.\nEven though Game 5 of the 1984 World Series was on a Sunday afternoon, Bob Costas (who anchored NBC's coverage with Len Berman) was still in New York City to host \"NFL '84\". At the end of the pre-game show, Costas left the New York studio to travel to Detroit to cover that night's baseball game at Tiger Stadium. In the meantime, Bill Macatee filled-in for Costas, providing updates and halftime highlights. Costas later interviewed the Tigers in their locker room that night. Game 5 of the 1984 World Series had a starting time of 4:45 p.m. ET, following a 1:30 p.m. start for Game 4. These were the last outdoor World Series games to start earlier than prime time in the eastern United States (Game 6 in , the last daytime World Series contest, was indoors at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis).\nIn 1985, NBC got a break when Major League Baseball dictated a policy that no local game could be televised at the same time that a network \"Game of the Week\" was being broadcast. Additionally, for the first time, NBC was able to feed the \"Game of the Week\" telecasts to the two cities whose local teams participated. In time, MLB teams whose Saturday games were not scheduled for the \"Game of the Week\" would move the start time of their Saturday games to avoid conflict with the NBC network game, and thus, make it available to local television in the team's home city (and the visiting team's home city as well). Also in 1985, NBC's telecast of the All-Star Game out of the Metrodome in Minnesota was the first program to be broadcast in stereo by a television network.\nOn Thursday, October 10, 1985, NBC didn't come on the air for Game 2 of the NLCS until 8:30 p.m. ET to avoid disrupting \"The Cosby Show\" at 8 (similarly to how the network aired the soap opera \"Return to Peyton Place,\" before Game 5 of the 1972 World Series, rather than a pre-game show). NBC would do the same thing for Thursday night games in subsequent postseasons. Dick Enberg hosted the 1985 NLCS with Joe Morgan. It was Enberg who broke the news to most of the nation that Vince Coleman had been injured before Game 4. NBC even aired an interview with one of the few people who actually saw the incident, a Dodger batboy.\nDick Enberg was also at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto for Games 1 and 7 of the 1985 American League Championship Series on NBC. Enberg hosted the alongside Rick Dempsey (who was still active with Baltimore at the time). Meanwhile, Bill Macatee provided a report on Game 2 of the ALCS during the pregame of the NLCS opener.\nBeginning in , Jon Miller would call games for NBC on their occasional doubleheader weeks. If not that, then Miller would appear on Saturday afternoon regionals the day after NBC's occasional prime time telecasts. Come the World Series that year, NBC would introduce a new theme called \"Heroes\". The track was composed by Steve Martin (no relation to the actor-comedian of the same name) of the production music factory Killer Tracks. NBC would use \"Heroes\" as their postseason and All-Star Game theme from 1986 to 1989, and also the \"Game of the Week\" theme for 1989. The theme itself, portrayed as serious, regal and almost reflective tone.\nVin Scully's call of the final play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on NBC television would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: \"So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. [A] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it!\" Scully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with \"If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well; and they will play the Red Sox in Game 7 tomorrow!\"\nAfter the top of the tenth, NBC began setting up in the visiting clubhouse for what they believed was the inevitable postgame victory celebration by the Boston Red Sox. The Commissioner's Trophy had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the presentation. However, after Bob Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned. Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being \"like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.\" Game 6 caused the first preemption of \"Saturday Night Live\", due to extra innings. The preempted episode would air two weeks later on November 8 (with host Rosanna Arquette and musical guest Ric Ocasek of The Cars), with an introduction by Ron Darling, who explained that when the Mets entered the locker room, they were informed that they caused the first delay in \"SNL\"s 11-year history (at the time) to their dismay.\nNBC's broadcast of Game 7 of the 1986 World Series (which went up against a \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the highest-rated single World Series game to date. Game 7 had been scheduled for Sunday, but a rain-out forced the game to Monday. NBC's telecast of the Series ended with the song \"Limelight\" from \"Stereotomy\", penultimate album of The Alan Parsons Project.\nNBC used Don Sutton as a pre- and post-game analyst for their 1987 League Championship Series coverage. Sutton also made an appearance in the booth during Game 3 of the ALCS. Sutton talked with Bob Costas and Tony Kubek about Twins pitcher Les Straker's borderline balk in that game. Sutton later interviewed Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson following their loss in Game 5. Meanwhile, Marv Albert went back-and-forth during both 1987 LCS. He hosted the pregame for Game 1 of the NLCS with Joe Morgan, and in fact had to read the lineups to the viewing audience. There was a problem with the P.A. feed at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, so he ended up reading the script from the Cardinal dugout while the players were introduced to the crowd. He then went to Minneapolis the next night to host the ALCS pregame with Don Sutton at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame coverage for Game 5 of the NLCS, as Marv Albert was away on a boxing assignment for NBC.\nJay Randolph, who was also the sports director for St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK, interviewed the winners in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse following their Game 7 victory. Also following Game 7, NBC's Marv Albert interviewed 1987 NLCS MVP, Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants (to date, the last person from the losing team to win a postseason series Most Valuable Player Award, either League Championship Series or World Series).\nRatings for the \"Game of the Week\" had dropped from an average of 6.1 in 1984 to 5.5 in 1988 and an average of 4.8 by July 1989. According to a Major League Baseball report, an average of fewer than five million households viewed the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" in 1988. In an effort to push the ratings higher, NBC tried to feature a club from one of the major media markets. Of the 32 games it aired during 1988, only three did not feature a club from New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles.\n1988 World Series and 1989 All-Star Game and League Championship Series.\nAs previously mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series for a national television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Bob Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit.\nThe following is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: \"All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [Scully began] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, you talk about a roll of the dice... this is it.\" Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was \"shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying to get rid of a troublesome fly.\" Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. \"High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!\" Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, \"In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!\" Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, \"And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!\" \"You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!\" \"They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!\" As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. \"Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back.\"\nDuring Game 1 in the second inning, NBC affiliate WMGT-TV in Macon, Georgia was hijacked for 10 seconds replacing parts of the second inning with an adult movie. The technician was later fired, and production manager L. A. Sturdivant reported to \"The Atlanta Constitution\" at the incident was an accident.\nBob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's 1988 World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, later made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). Before the start of Game 4, Costas said that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history. That comment ironically fired up the competitive spirit of the Dodgers. After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas.\nGame 6 of the 1988 World Series, was scheduled to start at 5 p.m. ET on Saturday, October 22, but that game wasn't necessary. This is the last time a World Series game was scheduled outside of prime time. The 1988 World Series also marked the last time that NBC would televise a World Series for seven years. Beginning in , NBC would be shut out of Major League Baseball coverage completely, after CBS signed a four-year, exclusive television contract. After splitting coverage of the 1995 World Series with ABC, NBC would next cover a World Series exclusively in 1997. Over a highlight montage at the end of their coverage of the decisive fifth game of the 1988 World Series, NBC played the song \"One Moment in Time\" by Whitney Houston.\nOn Saturday, June 3, 1989, Vin Scully was doing the play-by-play for the NBC \"Game of the Week\" in St. Louis, where the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers were playing a series in Houston, where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.\nAs previously mentioned, former President of the United States, Ronald Reagan (who had just left office) served as the color commentator instead of Tom Seaver (Vin Scully's normal NBC broadcasting partner at the time) for the first inning of the 1989 All-Star Game from Anaheim. Bo Jackson became a popular figure for his athleticism in multiple sports through the late 1980s and early 1990s. He served as a spokesman for Nike and was involved in a popular ad campaign called \"Bo Knows\" which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, \"You don't know diddley!\" (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, \"Bo...you \"do\" know Diddley, don't you?\") Serendipitously, the original spot first aired during the commercial break immediately following Jackson's lead-off home run in the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (as Vin Scully exclaimed, \"Look at that one! Bo Jackson says hello!\").\nCTV would simulcast NBC \"Game of the Week\" telecasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, such as NBC's final \"Game of the Week\" telecast on September 30, 1989, where the Blue Jays clinched the American League East against the Baltimore Orioles. Meanwhile, in the latter part of his career, National League umpire Doug Harvey became known for appearing in the \"You Make the Call\" segments on NBC's \"Game of the Week\" telecasts.\nThen Texas Rangers manager Bobby Valentine worked as an on-the-field analyst for NBC's 1989 ALCS coverage. Likewise, recently retired Philadelphia Phillies legend Mike Schmidt did the same for the NLCS.\nVin Scully was unable to call Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series because he was suffering from laryngitis. As a result, secondary play-by-play announcer Bob Costas filled in for him. Around the same time, Costas was assigned to call the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.\nJimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame show for Game 4 of the 1989 ALCS as Marv Albert was away on an NFL assignment for NBC.\nThe end of an era.\nAfter calling the 1988 World Series with Vin Scully, Joe Garagiola resigned from NBC Sports. Although it was not official at the time, NBC was on the verge of losing the television rights to cover Major League Baseball to CBS. Garagiola claimed that NBC left him \"twisting\" while he was trying to renegotiate his deal. Joe Garagiola was replaced by Tom Seaver for the 1989 season.\nOn December 14, 1988, CBS (under the guidance of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Major League Baseball's broadcast director Bryan Burns, CBS Inc. CEO Laurence Tisch as well as CBS Sports executives Neal Pilson and Eddie Einhorn) paid approximately US$1.8 billion (equivalent to billion in ) for exclusive over-the-air television rights for over four years (beginning in 1990). CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday \"Game of the Week\". It was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting. The cost of the deal between CBS and Major League Baseball was about 25% more than in the previous television contract with ABC and NBC.\nNBC's final Major League Baseball broadcast was televised on October 9, 1989; Game 5 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs from Candlestick Park. Vin Scully said When Cubs shortstop Ryne Sandberg made the final out of Game 5 off of Giants closer Steve Bedrosian and Giants first baseman Will Clark ultimately caught it, Scully said Bob Costas said that he would rather do a \"Game of the Week\" that got a 5 rating than host a Super Bowl. \"Who thought baseball killed its best way to reach the public? It coulda kept us and CBS – we'd have kept the 'Game' – but it only cared about cash. Whatever else I did, I'd never have left 'Game of the Week' Costas claimed. Tony Kubek, who (as previously mentioned) teamed with Bob Costas since 1983, said \"I can't believe it!\" when the subject came about NBC losing baseball for the first time since 1947.\nAuthor and presidential speechwriter Curt Smith went a step further in saying that Major League Baseball's deal with CBS Sports was \"sportscasting's Exxon Valdez.\" Had baseball valued national promotion provided by the \"Game of the Week\", said Smith, it never would have crafted a fast-bucks plan that has cut off the widest viewership. \"It's an obscene imbalance\", Smith also said, \"to have 175 games going to 60 percent of the country [in reference to Major League Baseball's corresponding cable television deal with ESPN, which at the time was only available in about 60% of the country] and 16 games going to the rest.\" He added: \"Baseball has paid a grievous price for being out of sight and out of mind. It's attacked the lower and middle classes that forms baseball's heart. ... In the end, the advertising community has come to view baseball as a leper.\"\nArthur Watson, president of NBC Sports, said in a statement that NBC had \"aggressively\" bid to continue its 41-year involvement in baseball (NBC's bid was reportedly in the $800 million range in contrast to CBS' bid of $1.08 billion) and was \"deeply saddened\" when learning of CBS' deal.\nOne possible key factor towards why NBC lost the baseball package to CBS was due to their commitment to broadcasting the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona. To put things into proper perspective, two weeks prior to the announcement of the baseball deal with CBS, NBC had committed itself to paying $401 million for U.S. broadcast rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the baseball deal was announced, some skeptics surmised that CBS had lowballed the Barcelona bidding so that it would have at least $1 billion to spend on baseball.\nOn that end, Marv Albert considered NBC's loss of the baseball rights to CBS a disappointment because they had just won the rights to televise the 1992 Olympic Games from Barcelona. Albert also told \"The New York Times\" in August 1989 that from NBC's point of view, it would come down to three major negotiations that would take place in the fall of that year. The National Basketball Association, the NCAA basketball tournament and some college football. Albert also agreed with the notion regarding whether the average fan would be shut out of Major League Baseball with only 12 Saturday afternoon games being televised by CBS. He added that the then present major league regime might not have agreed to the same package. According to him, Major League Baseball, similar to the NBA, felt that limited exposure would be better for the game. In Albert's eyes, what CBS was doing was televising the regular season for the delight of carrying the All-Star Game, the playoffs and the World Series.\nAccording to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package—that is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series—because such a commitment would have required them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games. Only CBS, with its weak prime time programming, dared go for that.\nAftermath.\nAfter NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counterprogrammed (like ABC) CBS's postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers. NBC also attempted to fill the void left by baseball by arranging with the National Hockey League to broadcast their annual All-Star Game. And almost exactly one month after NBC's final baseball telecast, the network officially announced a four-year, $600 million deal with the National Basketball Association, succeeding CBS as the league's network TV partner.\nFollowing his brief tenure as NBC's lead baseball analyst, Tom Seaver worked as an analyst for New York Yankees' telecasts on WPIX until 1993 and for New York Mets' telecasts on WPIX from 1999 to 2005, making him one of three sportscasters to be regular announcers for both teams; the others are Fran Healy and Tim McCarver.\nWhen NBC lost its baseball to CBS after the 1989 season, Tony Kubek left the national scene, joining the Yankees' local cable-TV announcing team. Kubek spent five years calling games for the Yankees (1990–1994) on the MSG Network with Dewayne Staats, where he earned fans and critics' respect for his honesty.\nAfter the National League Championship Series in 1989, Vin Scully's NBC contract was up and he left to focus primarily on his duties with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scully eventually returned to being the national radio announcer for the World Series, since CBS Radio gave him the position that Jack Buck had vacated in order to become the primary announcer of CBS's television coverage of Major League Baseball. Scully's first assignment was the 1990 World Series and he remained in that role until 1997, working with Johnny Bench for the first four years and Jeff Torborg for the final three.\nAfter leaving NBC Sports after the 1988 World Series, Joe Garagiola spent one season (1990) as a cable-television commentator for the California Angels. From 1998 to 2012, he performed part-time color commentary duties for the Arizona Diamondbacks, where his son Joe Jr. was general manager.\nOn July 21, 1990, approximately ten months after its final Major League Baseball telecast, NBC aired an amateur baseball game between the United States and Cuba from Estadio Latinoamericano in Havana, Cuba as part of the \"Saturday Sports Showcase\" anthology series. Bob Costas returned to provide play-by-play alongside former New York Mets manager Davey Johnson.\nThe Baseball Network (1994–95).\nAfter a four-year hiatus with CBS being the exclusive MLB over-the-air broadcaster, ABC and NBC returned to Major League Baseball under the umbrella of a revenue sharing venture called \"The Baseball Network\". While ABC and NBC would provide some production personnel and their own announcers for the games, all of would be coordinated from the office of Ken Schanzer, the chief executive officer of The Baseball Network and former executive vice president for NBC Sports. The graphics, camera placements, and audio quality were intended on looking and sounding about the same on both networks.\nThe Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994, with the All-Star Game out of Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. The game was televised on NBC with Bob Costas, Joe Morgan and Bob Uecker calling the action, and Greg Gumbel hosting the pre-game show. Helping with the interviews were Hannah Storm and Johnny Bench. The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots; this was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost $300,000.\nAfter the All-Star Game, NBC was scheduled to televise six regular season games on Fridays or Saturdays in prime time. The networks had exclusive rights for the twelve regular season dates, in that no regional or national cable service or over-the-air broadcaster may telecast a Major League Baseball game on those dates. In even-numbered years, NBC would have the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series, while ABC would have the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, the postseason and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate.\nThe long-term plans for The Baseball Network crumbled when the Major League Baseball Players' Association went on strike on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series). Consequently, NBC was unable to air its slate of games, which were supposed to begin on August 26. Therefore, the All-Star Game was NBC's sole baseball broadcast in 1994. Meanwhile, another consequence of the strike was that Dick Enberg, who was supposed to be the secondary play-by-play announcer in 1994 for NBC was unable to participate by the following season, due to his other commitments for NBC such as golf and football. As a result, his slot was taken by Greg Gumbel, who was also the secondary play-by-play man for CBS (behind Sean McDonough) during their final season of broadcasting Major League Baseball games in 1993.\nWhen the question aroused regarding why NBC didn't rehire Costas' old broadcast partner, Tony Kubek (for whom Costas worked with on the \"Game of the Week\" and NBC's bi-yearly coverage of the ALCS from 1983–1989), it was insinuated that Kubek was simply too independent-minded for NBC officials to tolerate. According to Costas, while he originally wanted to work with Kubek again, NBC simply wanted to go into a different direction after being away from baseball for nearly five years.\nIn July 1995, ABC and NBC, which wound up having to share the duties of televising the 1995 World Series as a way to recoup (with ABC broadcasting Games 1, 4 and 5, and NBC broadcasting Games 2 3, and 6), announced that they were opting out of their agreement with Major League Baseball. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century.\nPrior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger Albert Belle unleashed a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm as she was waiting in the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, she became the first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6, she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, she was not the first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993. She would also cover that same World Series but for a different network, ABC Sports.\nDuring the 1995–96 television season, the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals and Summer Olympics were all telecast by NBC, marking the only time in history that all four marquee events were aired by the same network.\nABC broadcaster Al Michaels would later write in his 2014 autobiography \"You Can't Make This Up: Miracles, Memories, and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television\" that the competition between the two networks could be so juvenile that neither ABC nor NBC wanted to promote each other's telecasts during the 1995 World Series. To give you a better idea, in the middle of Game 1, Michaels was handed a promo that read \"Join us here on ABC for Game 4 in Cleveland on Wednesday night and for Game 5 if necessary, Thursday.\" Michaels however, would soon follow this up by saying \"By the way, if you're wondering about Games 2 and 3, I can't tell you exactly where you can see them, but here's a hint: Last night, Bob Costas, Bob Uecker, and Joe Morgan [NBC's broadcast crew] were spotted in Underground Atlanta.\" Naturally, Costas soon made a similar reference to ABC's crew (Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver) on NBC.\nAbout five years after The Baseball Network dissolved, Bob Costas wrote in his book \"Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball\" that The Baseball Network was stupid and an abomination. Costas believed that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a national telecast was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. Unlike the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association the so-called \"Big Two\" of North American professional sports leagues, the National Football League and Major League Baseball had nationally televised all playoff games for decades. While he believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game (except in Costas' point-of-view, the sense that the fans held steadfast, spaniel-like loyalty), Costas himself acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented from watching many of the playoff games they wanted to see. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a Big Ten football game between Wisconsin and Michigan.\nTrouble at NBC (1996–2000).\nDespite the failure of The Baseball Network, NBC decided to retain its relationship with Major League Baseball, but on a far more restricted basis. Under the five-year deal signed on November 7, 1995 (running from the 1996 to 2000 seasons) for a total of approximately $400 million, NBC did not televise any regular season games. Instead, NBC only handled the All-Star Game, three Division Series games (on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday nights), and the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the World Series, three Division Series games (also on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday nights) and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years. Fox, which assumed ABC's portion of the league broadcast television rights, gained the rights to the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" during the regular season, in addition to alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series (the ALCS in odd-numbered years and the NLCS in even-numbered years), Division Series, and the World Series.\nAlso around this particular period, NBC adapted composer Randy Edelman's theme from the short-lived Fox series \"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\" as the main theme music for its baseball telecasts. However, NBC used Edelman's \"Emotions Run High\" from the film \"The Big Green\" as the theme for the network's coverage of the 1996 All-Star Game.\nDuring the Game 1 of the 1996 ALCS between the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, NBC was on hand for an incident in which a 12 year old fan named Jeffrey Maier deflected a batted ball, hit by Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter in the bottom of the eighth inning. Maier clearly reached over the fence separating the stands and the field of play nine feet below and snatched the ball with his glove. Right field umpire Rich Garcia immediately ruled the play a home run, tying the game at 4–4, despite the protest of Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco and manager Davey Johnson (the latter was ejected in the ensuing argument). The Yankees would go on to win the game in eleventh inning on Bernie Williams' walk-off home run.\n1997–99.\nJust before the start of NBC's coverage of the 1997 World Series, Don Ohlmeyer, president of the network's West Coast entertainment division and former executive producer for NBC Sports, came under fire after publicly announcing that he hoped that the World Series would end in a four-game sweep. Ohlmeyer believed that baseball now lacked broad audience appeal (especially in the aftermath of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike). As opposed to teams from the three largest television markets (New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) in the U.S., the 1997 World Series featured the matchup of the upstart Florida Marlins and the Cleveland Indians, which made their second World Series appearance in three years. In addition, Ohlmeyer feared that the World Series would disrupt NBC's efforts to attract enough viewers for its new fall roster in order to stay on top of the ratings heap. Ohlmeyer said \"If the A&amp;E channel called, I'd take the call.\" Game 5 fell on a Thursday, which had long been the highest rated night on NBC's schedule, if not on all of television.\nAlso beginning with the 1997 World Series, NBC would utilize their cable financial channel, CNBC for their post-game analysis programming. NBC was however, criticized over their apparent resistance to showing full line scores. Thus, this cheated viewers who wanted to know which innings runs were scored in. Dick Ebersol of NBC Sports opposed the idea of a score bug, because he thought that fans would dislike seeing more graphics on the screen, and would change the channel from blowout games.\nNBC was also criticized for refusing to use split screens of batters and pitchers, thus depriving viewers of a drama-enhancing technique. And its full-screen statistic graphics during the 1997 World Series was accused of blocking the action. And unlike Fox, who ran a scorebox icon in the corner of the screen throughout the game, updating viewers on the score, and the count and the runners on base, NBC only aired its version between pitches. According to NBC producer David Neal, who was in charge of the 1997 World Series production matters \"There is no question we know viewers are looking for information, but they don't want it to obscure their view of the game. We have been consistent at NBC that the scorebox is not for us.\"\nIn 1998, Bob Uecker abruptly left NBC Sports before a chance to call the All-Star Game from Coors Field in Colorado. Uecker underwent a back operation in which four discs were replaced. For the remainder of the contract (1998–2000), only Bob Costas and Joe Morgan called the games. Come the 1998 postseason and continuing through the end of their contract in 2000, NBC's pre-game coverage was sponsored by Sun America.\nAlso in 1998, NBC's coverage of the ALCS was the highest rated for any League Championship Series since before the 1994 strike. NBC averaged a 9.4 rating for the six games, which was a 6% increase than the network's coverage of the 1997 NLCS in the same time slot. The rating was 13% more than Fox's ALCS coverage in 1997 and 12% more than NBC's coverage in 1996.\nIn 1999, Bob Costas teamed with his then-NBC colleague Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The first was on Wednesday, August 25 with the Detroit Tigers playing against the Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta Braves playing against the New York Mets. Later that October, Costas and Morgan were on hand at New York's Shea Stadium for the 15 inning long fifth game of the NLCS between the Mets and Braves. The game ended with Mets third baseman Robin Ventura hitting what would become known as a \"Grand Slam Single\".\nFrom October 23–27, NBC broadcast their 39th and to date, final World Series. As previously mentioned, unlike NBC's prior two World Series (1995 and 1997), where Bob Uecker was in the booth, Bob Costas and Joe Morgan worked as a duo, as they had done since the 1998 All-Star Game. Hannah Storm again served as pre-game host with Barry Larkin this time, serving as the analyst. The field reporters were Jim Gray (New York Yankees' dugout) and Craig Sager (in the Atlanta Braves' dugout) on loan from Turner Sports.\nThe Jim Gray/Pete Rose interview.\nIn 1999, NBC field reporter Jim Gray, who had previously covered Major League Baseball for CBS, came under fire for a confrontational interview with banned all-time hit king Pete Rose. Just prior to the start of Game 2 of the World Series, Gray pushed Rose – on hand (by permission of Commissioner Bud Selig) at Turner Field in Atlanta as a fan-selected member of MasterCard's \"All-Century Team\" – to admit to having wagered on baseball games as manager of the Cincinnati Reds ten years earlier. After NBC was flooded with tons of viewer complaints, Gray was forced to clarify his actions to the viewers at home prior to Game 3. Regardless of Gray's sincerity, Game 3 hero Chad Curtis of the New York Yankees boycotted Gray's request for an interview live on camera; Curtis had hit a game-winning home run to send the World Series 3–0 in the Yankees' favor. Curtis said to Gray, \"Because of what happened with Pete, we decided not to say anything.\"\nDespite the heavy criticism he received, Gray offered no apology for his line of questioning toward Rose:\nAlthough Dick Ebersol (then-president of NBC Sports) and Keith Olbermann – among others – have maintained that Gray was simply doing his job, in 2004 Pete Rose would admit to betting on baseball (along with other sports) while he was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds.\n2000.\nIn 2000, NBC was caught in the dilemma of having to televise a first-round playoff game between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics over the first presidential debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore. NBC decided to give its local stations the option of carrying the debate or the baseball game. If an NBC affiliate decided to carry the debate, then the Pax TV affiliate in their local market could carry the game. NBC also placed a crawl at the bottom of the screen to inform viewers that they could see the debate on its sister channel MSNBC.\nOn the other end, Fox said that it would carry baseball on the two nights when its schedule conflicted with the presidential or vice presidential debates. NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin said \"We have a contract with Major League Baseball. The commission was informed well in advance of their selecting the debate dates. If we didn't have the baseball conflict we would be televising it.\" Although there has not been confirmation, anecdotal reports indicated that many NBC affiliates in swing states (such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania) chose to air the debate over the baseball game. This is an option that CBS affiliates did not have in 1992, when that network refused to break away from Game 4 of the American League Championship Series (which had gone into extra innings) to the first Clinton–Bush–Perot debate. Like NBC and Fox would do in 2000, CBS cited its contract with Major League Baseball.\nDuring NBC's coverage of the 2000 Division Series between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics, regular play-by-play announcer Bob Costas decided to take a breather after anchoring NBC's prime time coverage of the Summer Olympic Games from Sydney. In Costas' place was Atlanta Braves announcer Skip Caray, who teamed with Joe Morgan before Costas' return for the ALCS. It wasn't just Costas but all of NBC's production crews who were down in Sydney. The Olympics ended just two or three days before the MLB playoffs started that year, so the TBS crew worked the Division Series games for NBC.\nBaseball leaves NBC again.\nIn September 2000, Major League Baseball signed a six-year, $2.5 billion contract with Fox to televise Saturday afternoon regular-season baseball games, the All-Star Game and coverage of the Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series. 90% of the contract's value to Fox, which was paying the league $417 million per year, came from the postseason, which not only attracted large audiences, but also provided an irreplaceable opportunity for the network to showcase its fall schedule. Under the previous five-year deal with NBC (running from 1996 to 2000), Fox paid $115 million ($575 million overall), compared to the $80 million ($400 million overall) that NBC paid. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts was that Fox's Saturday \"Game of the Week\" was implicitly valued at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox's payment would have been $345 million, while NBC would have paid $240 million. NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer said regarding the loss of Major League Baseball rights for the second time since 1990:\nNBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol added that it was not cost-effective for NBC to be paying out the kind of money that Major League Baseball wanted. The network was also reportedly concerned over disruptions to its regular fall prime time lineup that would result from having to broadcast the playoffs and World Series. In addition, NBC had several NASCAR races scheduled during the summer.\nEbersol further added:\nThe last Major League Baseball game that NBC would televise prior to the Boston Red Sox-Chicago White Sox contest on May 8, 2022, was Game 6 of the 2000 American League Championship Series, occurring on October 17, 2000. In Houston, due to the coverage of the 2000 Presidential Debate, KPRC-TV elected to carry NBC News' coverage of the debate while independent station KNWS-TV carried the ALCS game via NBC.\nDuring the closing credits of that final game, NBC utilized the ending title theme by Ennio Morricone from the 1987 film \"The Untouchables\".\nThe loss of Major League Baseball was part of a slow decline for NBC's sports division. This began with its loss of the rights to the NFL's American Football Conference to CBS at the end of the 1997 season. In 2002, NBC lost its NBA rights to ABC. This all culminated in the unproductive 2004–05 prime time season (despite heavy promotion of its lineup during the 2004 Summer Olympics), when NBC carried no major championship sports events during prime time. NBC did, however, acquire the television rights to the National Hockey League in 2004, however that league ended up in a lockout that delayed the start of the contract by two years.\nIn response to NBC's impending loss of NBA coverage to ABC/ESPN in 2002, NBC Entertainment president Jeff Zucker said:\nWithin two years of the network losing the NBA rights, NBC dropped to fourth place in the prime time television rankings for the first time in its history, which was also partly the result of a weaker prime time schedule, and would more or less remain there for almost nine years.\nIn 2001, Bob Costas claimed that despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain alienation from the institution. By the time that NBC lost Major League Baseball for the second time in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season \"Game of the Week\". Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's \"On the Record with Bob Costas\", \"Inside the NFL\" and \"Costas Now\" as well as \"Costas on the Radio\") to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said \"I'm a little disappointed to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything.\" In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.\nReturn on Peacock.\nOn June 14, 2021, NBC Sports announced they would air a three-game series between the Philadelphia Phillies and the San Francisco Giants nationally on Peacock. The telecasts would represent the first time since 2000 that NBC Sports would produce a nationally televised Major League Baseball game. Jon Miller provided the play-by-play alongside Giants analyst Mike Krukow and Phillies analysts John Kruk and Jimmy Rollins.\nOn April 6, 2022, Major League Baseball and NBC Sports announced a multi-year deal for Peacock from each participating team. to air an exclusive package of 18 Sunday morning game broadcasts, beginning with a May 8, 2022, broadcast of a Chicago White Sox/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park. The games, all of which will be hosted by teams in the Eastern Time Zone, will have, in 2022, scheduled start times of 11:30 a.m. ET for the first six broadcasts (May 8 thru June 12), then 12 noon ET from June 19 thru September 4. The games will be available only on Peacock (except for the May 8 broadcast, which NBC would simulcast), and will also include pre- and post-game coverage; exclusive carriage of the All-Star Futures Game (an All-Star Game weekend event featuring minor-league prospects); and access to MLB's vault of highlights, classic games, and documentaries.\nThe deal with Peacock was the second that MLB reached with a streaming service in 2022, following an agreement announced on March 8 with Apple TV+ to air weekly Friday night doubleheaders.\nOn April 26, 2022, Andrew Marchand of the \"New York Post\" reported that Jason Benetti (who calls the Chicago White Sox games for NBC Sports Chicago, and also worked NBC's telecasts of baseball during the 2020 Summer Olympics) would serve as the lead by-play announcer for the games, joined by rotating analysts from each participating team. Separately, on the same day, NBC announced Ahmed Fareed as the studio host.\nWhen NBC aired the Chicago White Sox-Boston Red Sox game on May 8, 2022, it officially marked 7,873 days since the network last televised a Major League Baseball game. Jason Benetti broadcast the game alongside Steve Stone, representing the Chicago White Sox and Kevin Youkilis, who represented the Boston Red Sox.\nFor the 2023 season, NBC simulcast the May 7 game between the Baltimore Orioles and Atlanta Braves in Atlanta. This time, Matt Vasgersian provided the play-by-play duties alongside Andruw Jones, representing the Atlanta Braves and Ben McDonald, who represented the Baltimore Orioles.\nPeacock's deal with Major League Baseball ultimately expired following the 2023 season."

The first meeting between the two occurred on 1 March 1927 but wasn't played annually until 1952.\nHistory.\nWhile Brown had first played varsity ice hockey as far back as the 19th century, the team did not have any local facility and was forced to suspend operations for 20 years. In 1926, the Rhode Island Auditorium was built and enable the school to restart its program. The same year, Providence College began its ice hockey team, however, the new team lasted just one year before being mothballed. Providence returned to the ice after World War II and the two teams promptly began playing one another. The teams became fast rivals, sharing not only a state and a city but a home rink as well.\nBrown and Providence typically played one another twice a season and both were founding members of ECAC Hockey in 1961. Coincidentally, that was also the season that Brown completed the Meehan Auditorium, giving the program its first permanent on-campus home. A decade later, Providence followed suit, building the Schneider Arena. While the two played as conference opponents for over 20 years, they never met in a playoff game.\nIn 1984, Providence was one of seven member schools to leave the ECAC and form Hockey East. In order to continue the rivalry between the programs, the two schools began awarding the 'Mayor's Cup' to the winner of their annual match. In the years since splitting into separate conferences, Brown and Providence have played one another at least once a season except for 1987 and 2021 (as of 2022).\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

        "text": "The 2018–19 American International Yellow Jackets men's ice hockey season was the 71st season of play for the program, the 23rd at the Division I level, and the 16th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Yellow Jackets represented American International College and were coached by Eric Lang, in his 3rd season.\nSeason.\nFresh off of their best performance since joining Division I in 1999, American International upped the difficulty of their season by scheduling several strong opponents for 2019. They performed well in the season opener against Providence but then went through a bit of a skid as they tried to settle on the team's starting goaltender. By mid-November the team seemed to be stuck in the mud with an inconsistent offense and a porous defense. A stunning series sweep of Air Force, however, seemed to put the Yellow Jackets back on track; Zackarias Skog shut out the Falcons in both games and took full control of the AIC net for the remainder of the season. The team's offense, too, found its footing the same weekend and proved to be much more dependable afterwards.\nA 5-game winning streak helped push American International towards the top of the conference standings and the Yellow Jackets looked primed to compile their first winning season in 25 years. The only real trouble for AIC looked to be its performance in non-conference games. A loss to Massachusetts just after new year's was their third strait embarrassing defeat by a team outside of their conference. By all appearances, the Yellow Jackets looked to be able to compete in Atlantic Hockey, but woefully unprepared for the upper echelon of college hockey.\nAfter dropping its second weekend to RIT that year, AIC went on an 8–1 run that propelled them to the top of the standings. Not only did it guarantee the Yellow Jackets a winning record, but it gave them an 8-point cushion for the conference title. While the rest of Atlantic Hockey scrambled to catch up, American International headed off to Arizona and took on the 12th-ranked Sun Devils. While their non-conference losing streak continued, AIC fared far better than they had previously, fighting back from a 3-goal deficit in the second game to force overtime.\nAfter returning home, the teams chasing AIC had made up some ground but not enough. The Yellow Jackets split their final weekend and finished 3 points ahead of second place to take their first Atlantic Hockey crown and the first regular season championship of any kind for the program. While the team was riding high, their placement in the Pairwise ranks left the team with only one way of making the NCAA Tournament; a conference championship.\nAIC received a bye into the conference quarterfinal and welcomed Army for its final home games of the year. They got a tough fight from the service academy, but still managed to pull out a win in the series, advancing to a semifinal round for the first time since 1990. Despite facing the 8th-seed in the next round, AIC was pushed to the limit and saw the game go into overtime. Fortunately, the team's leading scorer, Blake Christensen, found the back of the net first and sent American International to the championship game. The match with Niagara was nearly a carbon-copy of the semifinal, with Christensen assisting on the winning goal in overtime. American International, with its first Atlantic Hockey championship, received the conference's automatic bid and was set to play the first NCAA tournament game in its 71-year history.\nEntering the tournament, AIC was unsurprisingly ranked as the 16th-and last team in the field. They travelled out to North Dakota to face top-seeded St. Cloud State and weren't expect to amount to much. The game began slow, with both teams only recording 6 shots in the first period, but AIC found itself with a 1–0 lead. The Huskies began attacking the Yellow Jacket goal in the second but Skog stood firm and turned aside all shots. Instead, it was American International who scored to double their advantage and as the third began, St. Cloud began to become more frantic. The Huskies cut the lead in half with a power play marker around the mid-point of the period, but that was all that Skog and the defense would allow. Despite firing nearly three times as many shots, St. Cloud went down to defeat in American International's first NCAA tournament game.\nWhile AIC couldn't continue their good fortune for another game, the team had already produced the best season in program history and had announced their arrival on the national stage with a tremendous upset victory.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Anders Bjorn Carlson (born June 16, 1998) is an American football placekicker for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Auburn. As a placekicker, he has been recognized as both a high school and collegiate All-American, as well as an All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) First Team and Lou Groza Award semifinalist selection.\nEarly years.\nCarlson attended and played football, soccer, and basketball at The Classical Academy (Titans) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In 2014, as a sophomore, he made four of six field goal attempts with a long of 44 yards, as well as nine out of 10 extra-point attempts (PATs). In 2015, as a junior, he made 11 of 18 field goal attempts with a long of 52 yards, and 37 of 38 PATs. In 2016, as a senior, he made 13 of 23 field goal attempts, including a long of 51 yards, and all 49 of his PATs.\nCarlson was invited to and played in the 2017 Under Armour All-America Game. A three-star college prospect was the highest-rated prep kicker recruit in the nation coming out of high school. ESPN rated him a top-10 overall recruit prospect in the state of Colorado. He committed to play college football for the Auburn Tigers over scholarship offers from Oklahoma State and Vanderbilt.\nAs a soccer player, Carlson helped the Titans to the 2014 and 2015 Class 4A State finals.\nCollege career.\n2017 season.\nIn 2017, Carlson redshirted his true freshman football season at Auburn as he served as the backup placekicker to his older brother, Daniel.\n2018 season.\nIn 2018, prior to his redshirt freshman, Carlson gained attention after kicking a 62-yard field goal at Auburn's practice facility. That season, he successfully converted 15 of 25 field goal attempts, including two 53-yard field goals, which were the second-longest field goals made in Auburn program history by a freshman. He also converted all 44 PATs, including going 9-for-9 in the 2018 Music City Bowl against Purdue. He further forced 51 touchbacks on 70 total kickoffs. On November 24, 2018, against in-state rival Alabama, he recorded his first and only career reception, a 3-yard catch on a fake field goal play.\n2019 season.\nIn 2019, Carlson entered his redshirt sophomore season as an SEC Media Preseason All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) Second Team and SEC Coaches Preseason All-SEC Third Team placekicker. He earned SEC Special Teams Player of the Week honors after making all four of his field goal attempts – from 43 (twice), 44, and 52 yards – in Auburn’s 48–45 upset win over Alabama in the “Iron Bowl.” His 52-yard field goal attempt against Alabama tied his brother, Daniel, and Al Del Greco, for Auburn’s longest field goal ever in Iron Bowl history. His third PAT made against Arkansas set an NCAA record for consecutive successful PATs (303) by Auburn kickers; a streak started by former Auburn kicker, Cody Parkey, in 2013 and that spanned six seasons, 78 games, and five different Auburn kickers. He finished his 2019 campaign by making 18 out of 25 field goal attempts and 48 out of 49 PATs, as well as 47 touchbacks on 78 kickoffs.\n2020 season.\nIn 2020, entering his redshirt junior season, Carlson was selected to the SEC Media Preseason All-SEC Third Team and the Phil Steele All-SEC Fourth Team. That season, he made 20 out of 22 field goal attempts, including a long of 50 yards, and 24 out of 25 PATs. He was twice selected to the Lou Groza “Star of the Week” list for his kicking efforts against Arkansas and Mississippi State.\nHis 2020 season performance earned him Lou Groza Award (best placekicker in college football) semifinalist, American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) FBS Coaches’ All-America Second Team, Phil Steele All-America Honorable Mention, and Associated Press (AP) All-SEC First Team honors.\n2021 season.\nIn 2021, as a redshirt senior, he made 14 of 21 field goal attempts with a long of 49 yards, as well as 35 of 36 PATs. On November 13, in Auburn’s game against Mississippi State, he suffered a season-ending torn ACL.\nCarlson’s career performance places him with the fifth-most points (275), third-most field goals made (53), and sixth-most PATs made (116) in Auburn program history.\nCarlson earned Special Teams MVP honors for Auburn’s 2018, 2019, and 2021 “A-Day” spring football games. Auburn's 2020 A-Day was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProfessional career.\nCarlson was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round (207th overall) of the 2023 NFL draft. He signed his rookie contract on May 5.\nIn his rookie season, Carlson led the NFL in missed kicks with thirteen. In the Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, Carlson missed a field goal which would have given the Packers a seven point lead and forced the 49ers to tie the game rather than take the lead. The Packers would end up losing 24–21, ending their season. Head coach Matt LaFleur and Carlson's Packer teammates came out in support of Carlson, with LaFleur stating that Carlson's missed kick was not the sole reason for the loss. On January 24, 2024, the Packers signed Jack Podlesny to compete with Carlson.\nPersonal life.\nCarlson was born to parents, Jodie and Hans, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He has two brothers, Nils and Daniel. Daniel Carlson is the placekicker for the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) and was also an All-American kicker at Auburn.\nIn 2017, as a freshman at Auburn, he earned Academic Top Tiger and SEC First-Year Academic Honor Roll recognition. In both 2018 and 2019, he earned AD Honor Roll honors. He earned SEC Academic Honor Roll recognition every year from 2018 to 2020. In both 2019 and 2020, he earned CoSIDA Academic All-District honors. In 2020, he graduated from Auburn with a degree in aviation from the university's College of Business. He is now pursuing his master's degree.\nCarlson is a Christian. He has said, “I think the biggest thing for me is just knowing my identity. I think for me, faith is a really big thing. My current thing I’m doing is football, but that’s not who I am. I’m just focused on the things I can control, but knowing my identity is not in football, it’s in God.”"

Williams announced in August 2000 that he would leave at the end of the season.\nThe IRFU rejected a proposal for a Celtic League involving three of the Irish provinces, two Scottish super-districts and seven Welsh clubs, each playing 22 matches. The IRFU argued that the structure proposed would add too many games and leave provincial players unable to play for their clubs, and made a counter-proposal of an eleven-game season, which the Welsh and Scottish unions rejected. Discussions continued, and a format was finally agreed for the following season.\nThey were bottom of their pool in the Heineken Cup, failing to qualify for the knockout stage.

The club began on the 14th of November 1885, established by Lt Gen Sir Henry D'Oyley Torrens only days after he arrived in the Cape Colony, soon to serve as acting Governor. A rough first 9-hole course was completed on Waterloo Green at the Wynberg Military Camp and presented the first monthly medal contest in 1886, won by the Torrens himself with a gross of 94.\nThe club was granted Royal status by King George V in 1910 in commemoration of the visit of the Duke of Connaught, who represented the king at the opening of the first Union of South Africa parliament.\nCourse.\nThe 6,121 meter course is a par 72 parklands style course built on relatively flat terrain, exposed to the Cape Doctor, the Cape's famous persistent and dry south-easterly wind that blows on the coast from spring to late summer (September to March).\nTournaments hosted.\nIn addition to the Cape Town Open (since 2012) and the Cape Town Ladies Open (since 2015), the club has hosted a number of high-profile professional and amateur tournaments.

        "text": "Regulations relating to the eligibility of players to play for national teams in rugby union, both in the fifteen-a-side game and rugby sevens, are the responsibility of World Rugby, the governing body for the sport. Players' eligibility to represent a country depends on whether they have a genuine, close, credible and established national link with that country.\nIn principle, as soon as a player has represented a country internationally (has been \"captured\" by that country), they are no longer permitted to represent another country. However, a player is allowed to transfer to another country once, with approval of the World Rugby Regulations Committee, if the player is born in the country to which they wish to transfer or has a parent or grandparent who was born in that country. Playing for a second country is not permitted by means of residency. Switching countries is also possible through playing in Olympic events, provided the player has the nationality of the second country. In any case, a stand-down period of three years applies.\nHistory.\nPre-2000.\nWorld Rugby was founded, as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB), in 1886. \nUntil the 1990s, a player needed to be born in a country or have a parent or grandparent born in a country, to be eligible to play for that country's national team. Provided they met these criteria, players could play for more than one country and transfer to another country without a stand-down period.\nFormally, the IRFB Regulations did not provide for eligibility based on residency, but during the 20th century there were multiple examples of players representing nations with which they had no birth or family connection. This changed in the early 1990s, when the IRFB amended its eligibility rules to specifically allow foreign players to play for a country after three years of residence. Also a stand-down period of three years was introduced for captured players (i.e., players who had represented a country at international level) seeking to represent another country.\nIn March 1994, the IRFB reduced the residency requirement for foreign players from three years to one year of residence.\n2000 amendments: the one-country-for-life rule.\nBoth the eligibility rules and the adoption of professionalism in 1995 increased the number of players representing nations other than their country of birth. Particularly the number of Pacific Island players representing New Zealand and Australia (either in the fifteen-a-side form of the game or in sevens) and Southern Hemisphere players playing for Northern Hemisphere nations grew significantly in the second half of the 1990s, due to a big difference in resources and professional pathways between rugby nations.\nEventually, after a review of the eligibility rules, the IRFB – on 17 January 1997 – adopted an amendment to its regulations (effective from 1 January 2000) that meant that a player could only represent one country. A player who had represented a country by playing for its national team, official second national (or \"A\") team or sevens team against an equivalent team from another country, would no longer be able to switch countries.\nPlayers who played for a national team after 1 January 1997 could no longer change countries, because the stand-down period of three years would be completed after the \"one-country-for-life rule\" came into effect. It also resulted in unions rushing into capping dual eligible players before 1 January 2000, before the new rule would prevent them from doing so. This went as far as the Scottish Rugby Union organising a match between Scotland A and the Netherlands on 21 December 1999 for the sole purpose of capturing players Paul Johnstone (35 caps for Zimbabwe) and Alistair Murdoch (2 caps for Australia) before the new rule came into effect.\n2000–2014.\nIn this period there were several unsuccessful attempts to change the rules. \nIn March 2000, an Australian proposal to abolish the grandparent rule and to extend the required residency period from three to five years failed to get support. One month later, the IRB discussed a New Zealand proposal to remove sevens teams as capturing teams.\nIn November 2004, the IRB rejected another proposal from New Zealand. This (amended) proposal asked to allow players who had played for Tier 1 countries to change to Tier 2 countries after a stand-down period of one year, if they satisfied the eligibility criteria for the Tier 2 country. New Zealand's original proposal was again to remove sevens from capturing players for fifteens, but it was not voted on. The IRB preferred to await the decision of the International Olympic Committee about making sevens an Olympic sport.\nIn December 2009, a Federation of Oceania Rugby Unions' proposal, backed by New Zealand, again asked to allow Tier 1 players to switch to Tier 2 nations after a 12-month stand-down. This proposal was met with significant resistance from particularly Ireland, Scotland and Wales and was sent back to the IRB Regulations Committee. One of the arguments raised was that it could possibly be discriminatory because it seemed to favour players of some ethnicities over others.\n2014 amendments: Olympic loophole.\nAfter a failed attempt in 2005, and following lobbying by the IRB, rugby sevens was added to the Olympic Programme for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics on 9 October 2009. \nIn 2014, the IRB amended its regulations. A requirement for players to be a national of the country they represent at the Olympic Games was introduced, in addition to the existing eligibility criteria of having a genuine, close, credible and established national link with that country. Captured players were allowed to change to another country of which they had the nationality after a stand-down period of three years, which was reduced to 18 months for the 2016 Olympic Sevens. \nInitially, players who represented a new country at one sevens tournament regarded as an Olympic event, could represent that country in any other form of the game. While the IRB's Regulations Committee would consider every application for transfer to another country and check whether the reasons for the application were \"bona fide sevens reasons\", the IRB decided to tighten its regulations to prevent abuse that went against the spirit of the regulation. On 18 September 2014, the IRB ruled that a player had to play in at least four Olympic events to complete their transfer to another country.\n2017 amendments: extension of the residency requirement period.\nFrom 2016, the residency period was back on the agenda of World Rugby (as the IRB was called since 19 November 2014). The main driver behind this was the vice-chairman Agustín Pichot. Pichot was determined to put an end to the player drain from smaller nations – such as the Pacific Island nations – and the phenomenon of so-called project players.\nOn 10 May 2017, World Rugby adopted the following changes to the eligibility rules in Regulation 8:\nOn 10 August 2020, World Rugby decided to retain the 36-month residency requirement for one more year, to 31 December 2021. World Rugby considered that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were too limited playing opportunities for players to meet the residency requirement and have represented their union before the end of the year 2020.\nSubsequently, the Scottish Rugby Union announced that it had hired a team of scouts (\"Scottish Qualified representatives\") that would start a world-wide search for players with Scottish ancestry, who would be eligible to play for Scotland, despite not being born there.\n2021 amendments: exception to the one-country-for-life rule.\nMore than twenty years after the one-country-for-life rule came into effect, and several failed attempts to change this rule later, World Rugby voted to amend the rule – with the narrowest of margins – on 24 November 2021. From 1 January 2022, a player who has been captured by playing for a country in either XVs or sevens can change to a new country \"once\", provided they or their (grand)parents were born in the new country. A stand-down period of three years applies and a transfer is subject to approval by the World Rugby Regulations Committee.\nThis eligibility rule change, which was reportedly passed by a vote of 39 in favour, 11 against, and 1 abstention (39 votes were needed for the required 75% majority) is expected to mostly benefit the Pacific Island nations and a few (other) tier 2 or 3 nations.\nAnother amendment to the eligibility rules adopted on 24 November 2021 aims to align the \"age of majority\" across XVs and sevens rugby. Under the amended rule, all players will be captured by playing for a national representative team at the age of 18 years.\nCurrent eligibility rules.\nThis section describes the current eligibility rules, of which some will be further clarified by means of the Explanatory Guidelines on the Implementation of Regulation 8: Eligibility to play for National Representative teams (abbr.: ENRT Guideline) and Olympic Eligibility (abbr.: OE Guideline).\nPrimary eligibility criteria.\nThe main eligibility rule for rugby union is laid down in Regulation 8.1 and reads as follows:\nNational link established by birth.\nThe term \"parent\" refers to a player's blood parent or a parent who has formally adopted the player in line with the applicable legal requirements of the country concerned. Grandparent is the parent's blood parent or their legal adoptive parent. In case of legal adoption of the player, the birthplace of the blood parent is no longer relevant for determining the player's eligibility; similarly, in case of legal adoption of a parent of the player, the country of birth of that parent's blood parent will not be taken into account. The birthplace of stepparents or foster parents will never be considered (ENRT Guideline 13).\nIn most cases, it will be clear in which country's geographical borders someone is born, but in cases where it's not (e.g., a player being born in a military hospital or in an enclave), the matter should be referred to the World Rugby Regulations Committee for a ruling (ENRT Guideline 12).\nDespite the apparent ease with which a player's – or their (grand)parent's – birthplace can normally be determined, it was the grandparent rule that gave rise to the biggest eligibility scandal to date. In the so-called Grannygate saga, Wales and Scotland were found to have fielded players who were incorrectly assumed to be eligible, without any satisfactory evidence of these players' grandparents being born in Wales/Scotland. The embarrassment caused by the scandal was bigger than the official punishment. On 3 May 2000, the independent judicial panel that was convened by the IRFB to investigate the matter only reprimanded the Welsh and Scottish national unions and ordered them to pay the costs of the hearing. The panel stated not to have jurisdiction to take action against union officials and the players concerned, and didn't impose any sanction against them. However, the players were barred from playing for these nations until they had completed the 3-year residency period.\nNational link established by residence.\nResidence\n\"Residence\" in terms of Regulation 8 is the place where the player has their \"primary and permanent home\". Factors that will be taken into account include, among others, the actual time spent in a country and the purpose of any absences during the qualification period (ENRT Guideline 14). A player who has moved from one country to another will need to be able to provide clear proof that they are no longer resident in the country where they moved from and that that country is no longer their home (ENRT Guideline 15).\nA player can go on holiday, visit family and friends, attend weddings or funerals in other countries without interrupting their period of residence. World Rugby uses the guideline that a player – exceptional circumstances excluded – has to be physically present in a country for at least 10 months throughout any qualifying year of the residency period to be able to show that that country is their primary and permanent home (ENRT Guideline 16).\nStudents\nIn the majority of cases, a full-time international student's permanent and primary home is expected to be their parental home and time spent in another country will likely be seen as temporary absences from that home, especially if the student is not financially independent. However, the overriding factor in determining a student's eligibility remains whether there is a credible and established link with the country concerned (ENRT Guideline 19).\nStudents, particularly students who have reached the age of majority, can begin a new residency period in the country in which they are studying, if they have moved there permanently and only have taken short breaks away from the new country (in accordance with ENRT Guideline 16). With regard to the residency period of students, Unions and players are advised to ask for a ruling of the Regulations Committee about the player's eligibility. It is also explicitly stated that Unions and educational institutions are not allowed to offer scholarships and other benefits that restrict a player's choice of which Union they wish to represent (ENRT Guideline 19).\nExample\nSitiveni Sivivatu is an example of a player who was prevented from playing for New Zealand in 2004, because – according to the then current interpretation from the IRB – his time spent at Wesley College (South Auckland, New Zealand) in 2000 and 2001 did not count towards the 36-month residency requirement. Attending school or university in another country was seen by the IRB as temporary absence from a player's permanent home, without taking into account the player's age; Sivivatu was 18 years old when he moved to New Zealand in 2000.\nNationality.\nPlayers who would like to participate in the Olympic Games, or in Olympic (qualifying) events, must meet the criteria in Regulation 8.1 to 8.4 as well as hold the nationality of the country of the National Olympic Committee which they are representing in such Olympic Events. The nationality requirement was introduced to comply with the eligibility rules in the Olympic Charter. (Regulation 8.9)\nCombined teams\nSometimes, a member Union of World Rugby doesn't have an equivalent National Olympic Committee; in such cases, there may be a combined NOC for more than one Union. An example is Team GB (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, represented by the all-Ireland body of the Irish Rugby Football Union). Players who are eligible to play for an individual Union that is part of a combined NOC are also eligible to play for the Olympic Sevens Team of that NOC in Olympic Events, e.g. Great Britain 7s (OE Guideline 12).\nException to the eligibility rule: captured players.\nThe main exception to the eligibility rule in Regulation 8.1 can be found in Regulation 8.2, which defines the \"one-country-for-life rule\":\nCapturing representative teams.\nIn the usual form of rugby union (XVs), the capturing teams are a Union's fifteen-a-side national representative team and next senior fifteen-a-side national representative team.\nPlayers can be captured in matches against the senior or next senior national representative team of another Union; against senior or next senior (visiting) touring squads during an international tour approved by World Rugby; or in matches for a Union's (travelling) senior or next-senior touring squad during a World Rugby approved international tour. Regulation 8.3 sets out further criteria, one of them being that a player must be present at a match either as a replacement, substitute or playing member to be captured (Reg. 8.3 and ENRT Guideline 5).\nIn the sevens variant, a player is captured if they are named in a Union's senior national representative sevens team for an international match against the senior national representative sevens team of another Union, and is present at the match either as a replacement, substitute or playing member. A player can also be captured if they are named in a Union's senior national representative sevens team for the Olympic Games or the Rugby World Cup Sevens, and – again – is present at such tournament either as a replacement, substitute or playing member (Reg. 8.4 and ENRT Guideline 5).\nIn order to be captured, a player must have reached the age of majority on or before the date of participation in an international match (ENRT Guideline 5). ENRT Guideline 7 states that, for the purpose of the World Rugby Regulations, \"the age of majority is deemed to be acquired on a Player's 18th birthday.\"\nNational Under 20 teams are not capturing national representative teams in terms of regulation 8, and can – since 1 January 2018 – also no longer be designated as a Union's \"next senior fifteen-a-side National Representative Team\".\nExamples\nThe question whether a player had been captured under regulation 8 has given rise to many rulings of the IRB/World Rugby.\nOne example is the case of Jason Jones-Hughes. When Australian born Jones-Hughes, whose father was born in Wales, was named in the Wales squad for the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Rugby Australia lodged a complaint with the IRB. The Australians claimed he was ineligible to play for Wales because he had played for the Australian Barbarians against Scotland in 1998, which they said was Australia's next senior representative team. In first instance, the IRB ruled in Australia's favour, but Jones-Hughes appealed the decision and the IRB's executive committee sided with Jones-Hughes. According to the committee, there were two players playing for the Barbarians against Scotland, who were not eligible to play for Australia. In that game, the Barbarians therefore did not meet the criteria of a national representative team.\nAnother case is that of Steven Shingler. Shingler was named in the Scotland squad for the 2012 Six Nations. Wales submitted an objection to the IRB, because he had played for the Wales Under 20 team in 2011. The IRB Regulations Committee upheld the objection, stating that Shingler was captured by Wales because – at the time – both Wales Under-20 and the opposition team (France Under-20 team) were the respective Unions' designated next senior fifteen-a-side national representative team. The Scottish Rugby Union appealed the decision, but the IRB Council dismissed the appeal.\nA final example with far-reaching consequences relates to matches played by Romania, Spain and Belgium during the European qualification for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The three countries were docked points by an Independent Disputes Committee set up by World Rugby for fielding ineligible players. Romania was penalised for fielding Sione Fakaʻosilea in eight matches, including six World Cup qualifiers, despite Faka'osilea having already played for the Tonga Sevens team during the 2013 Gold Coast Sevens. As a result of the points deduction, Romania lost its World Cup spot in pool A to Russia (initially third on the qualification table). Spain was penalised because two ineligible players – who had previously played for the France Under-20 team – had played for Spain in a total of nine test matches, of which eight World Cup qualification matches. This resulted in Spain losing its World Cup qualification play-off spot to Germany (initially fifth and last on the qualification table). Belgium was found to have played five ineligible players in a total of six qualification matches. These players were ineligible because they, nor their (grand)parents were born in Belgium (they didn't claim eligibility under the residency rule). Appeals by Romania and Spain against these decisions were dismissed by an Independent Appeal Committee convened by World Rugby.\nMulti-country teams: Pacific Islanders team\nIn 2003, the IRB agreed to a request from the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance for an international tour of a combined Pacific Islanders team. Between 2004 and 2006, the Pacific Islanders team played 11 matches, of which 9 tests against the national representative teams of Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, England, France and Italy.\nClarifying the eligibility rules applicable to the Pacific Islanders' test matches, the IRB ruled in May 2004 that playing for the Pacific Islanders team would not capture an uncapped player's eligibility. So a player who hadn't played international rugby yet and was eligible to play for one or more of the Pacific Island nations and/or a third country (e.g. New Zealand, Australia), would not be captured by any of these nations by playing for the Pacific Islanders team.\nExceptions to the one-country-for-life rule.\nRegulations 8.6 and 8.7 describe which criteria must be met in order to be exempted from the one-country-for-life rule in Regulation 8.2:\nRegulations 8.6-8.8 make clear that a player can switch countries only once and only if their eligibility for the second country is based on the player or their (grand)parent being born in the second country. Eligibility for the second country cannot be established through residency. In case of Olympic transfer, the player must also have the nationality of the second country.\nIn all cases, there is a stand-down period of three years between the last game the player played for the senior, next senior or senior sevens national representative team of their original Union and the time the player first represents the second Union in a match, tournament or series of matches (ENRT Guideline 4.5). The stand-down period may in certain circumstances be reduced or cancelled for Olympic transfers.\nFor birthright transfer, approval of the World Rugby Regulations Committee must be obtained. Applications to World Rugby cannot be considered before all criteria for transfer have been met (ENRT Guideline 4.3). For Olympic transfer, also the approval of the International Olympic Committee and the relevant National Olympic Committees must be obtained."

Before this series, Queensland had won 22 times, NSW 16 times, with two series drawn.\nGame I.\nGame One was played at Sydney's Accor Stadium, and was won by Queensland, 16 points to 10.\nBlues centre Jack Wighton and Queensland five-eighth Cameron Munster produced performances of note, with the latter named Man of the Match. The match was also notable for its high attendance of 80,512 people, the highest rugby league attendance since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGame II.\nGame Two, held at Perth's Optus Stadium, before a sellout crowd of 59,358, saw Matt Burton and Nathan Cleary masterclasses deliver New South Wales a 44-12 victory to level the series at 1-1. Cleary scored 2 tries and 8 goals for a combined points total of 24, the second highest behind Ryan Girdler's 32 in New South Wales' 56-16 demolition of Queensland in Game III 2000. \nGame III.\nGame Three, held at Suncorp Stadium started with three players being knocked out in the opening three minutes of the contest (Cameron Murray, Selwyn Cobbo and Lindsay Collins). After this, Queensland scored the opening try, before NSW exploded to take a 12-6 lead with tries to Jarome Luai and Jacob Saifiti. However, Queensland drew back within two points just before half time, capitalising on a dropped bomb from Daniel Tupou. \nThe second half began with a brawl between Queensland centre Dane Gagai and New South Wales centre Matt Burton. Gagai and Burton were both sent to the sin bin. From this moment on, Queensland began to wrestle momentum back through the kicking game of Daly Cherry-Evans and Ben Hunt, pinning New South Wales down their own end.

        "title": "Bill Buckner's 1986 World Series error",
        "text": "Bill Buckner's 1986 World Series error was a baseball play that occurred in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on October 25, 1986, at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York.\nBuckner's tenth-inning error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets remains one of the most memorable plays in baseball history; it was long considered part of a curse on the Red Sox that kept them from winning the World Series, and led to years of fan anger and public mockery that Buckner handled graciously before being embraced by Red Sox fans again after their 2004 World Series victory.\nThe play is often known as the \"Buckner play\" and is blamed on the first baseman, but Mookie Wilson's smart at-bat and speed also affected the course of events. (If Buckner had made that play and Wilson had been safe, Howard Johnson would have been the next batter with runners on first and third. If Wilson had been put out by Buckner, the game would have gone into an 11th inning.)\nBackground.\nDuring the season, Buckner started all 162 games and shattered his own big league record with 184 assists. Toward the end of the season, he was hobbled by leg injuries and struggled throughout the playoffs.\nIn 1986, it appeared that the Boston Red Sox's fortunes were about to change. The team's hitting and offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Bill Buckner, Don Baylor, and future Hall of Famer Wade Boggs who would win 5 batting titles. Roger Clemens led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 ERA to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971. This feat has been replicated twice since then (Justin Verlander in 2011, Clayton Kershaw in 2014).\nThe Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, prompting a playoff series against the California Angels in the American League Championship Series. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two games at their home stadium, taking a 3–1 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6–5. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.\nBefore the 1986 New York Mets season, Nelson Doubleday Jr. sold his publishing company to the (then) West German multinational corporation Bertelsmann AG, and used the proceeds from the sale to buy the Mets in his own name for $81 million. He then sold a half-stake to Fred Wilpon, making them equal partners in the team.\nUnlike the league champion Mets of 1969 or 1973, the 1986 Mets hit the ground running, breaking away from the rest of the division early and dominating throughout the entire year. They won 20 of their first 24 games, clinched the East Division title on September 17, and finished the year 108–54, which tied with the 1975 Cincinnati Reds for the third highest win total in National League history, behind the 1906 Chicago Cubs (116) and the 1909 Pittsburgh Pirates (110). The relative lack of excitement during the regular season was more than compensated for by the spectacularly suspenseful and dramatic post-season series.\nPostseason.\nIn the National League Championship Series, the Mets faced their fellow 1962 expansion team, the Houston Astros. Unlike the Mets, the Astros had yet to win a pennant, but had former Mets pitchers Mike Scott, the league's Cy Young Award winner, and fireballer Nolan Ryan leading their pitching staff. The Mets took a two-games-to-one lead with a come-from-behind walk-off home run by Lenny Dykstra. In Game 6, the Mets turned a 3–0 ninth-inning deficit into a sixteen-inning marathon victory to clinch the National League pennant and earn their third World Series appearance, their first since 1973.\nAfter New York scored three runs in the top of the 9th to force extra innings, they scored three more runs in the top of the 16th. Houston soon answered with two of its own before Jesse Orosco fanned Kevin Bass to end the game. The Astros would have to wait until 2005 to finally win their first pennant.\nIn the postseason for the first time in his career, Mookie Wilson batted just .115 in the NLCS against the Astros. However, he scored the only run allowed by NLCS MVP Mike Scott in Game 4 of the series, and drove in and scored a run in the ninth inning of Game 6, when the Mets scored three runs in their last at bat to send the game into extra innings. He was batting a far better .273 in the World Series when he came to the plate in the tenth inning of Game 6.\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 6.\nThe 1986 Red Sox were leading the heavily favored New York Mets 3 games to 2 in the 1986 World Series when Game 6 went into extra innings. For his part, Buckner was batting just .143 against Mets pitching, and he was 0–for–5 in Game 6. When the Sox scored 2 runs in the top of the tenth, Boston manager John McNamara chose to have Buckner take the field in the bottom of the inning instead of bringing Dave Stapleton in as a defensive replacement for the ailing Buckner, as he had in Games 1, 2, and 5.\nThe play.\nAfter retiring Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez, Red Sox relief pitcher Calvin Schiraldi surrendered singles to the next three batters, Gary Carter, Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight, to bring the score to 5–4 with runners on first and third. With Mookie Wilson stepping up to the plate, Bob Stanley replaced Schiraldi on the mound. During his ten pitch at-bat, Wilson avoided being hit by a wild pitch that scored Kevin Mitchell from third and tied the score. Two pitches later, he hit a slow roller to Bill Buckner at first base.\nAware of Wilson's speed, Buckner tried to rush the play. As a result, the ball rolled beside his glove, through his legs, and into right field, allowing Ray Knight to score the winning run from second base.\nHad Buckner fielded the ball with Wilson safe at first, the score would have remained tied for the next Mets batter. Had Buckner put out Wilson at first base – either by himself or by throwing to a covering Stanley – Game 6 would have gone to an 11th inning.\nThe calls.\nJack Buck.\nThe national radio coverage of the 1986 World Series was handled by CBS Radio Sports with Jack Buck calling the play-by-play alongside then Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson. The following is a word-for-word transcript of Buck and Anderson's commentary during the final moments of Game 6:\nJ: Wild pitch. Here's the pitch to Mookie Wilson. Winning run at second. Ground ball to first, it is a run—an \"error\"! An error by Buckner! The winning run scores! The Mets win it 6–5 with three in the tenth! The ball went right through the legs of Buckner and the Mets with two men out and nobody on have scored three times to bring about a seventh game, which will be played here tomorrow night. Folks, it was unbelievable. An error, right through the legs of Buckner. There were two on, nobody out, a single by Carter, a single by Mitchell, a single by Ray Knight, a wild pitch, an error by Buckner. Three in the ninth for the Mets. They've won the game 6–5 and we shall play here... tomorrow night! Well, open up the history book, folks, we've got an entry for you...What do you think, Sparky?\nS: I never seen nothing like it. Here you got two out, two run lead, you figure Carter up, he can't even hurt you. He gets a base hit, another base hit, another base hit...wild pitches, ball rolls through the guys legs. I've never seen nothing like it, Jack.\nBob Murphy.\nLocally in New York, radio coverage the 1986 World Series was broadcast on WHN with Bob Murphy and Gary Thorne on the call.\nMurphy: A slow ground ball went right through the legs of Buckner down the\nright field line. The Mets have won the ballgame. Three runs in the bottom\nhalf of the 10th inning. Three runs in the 10th inning. They were down to\ntheir final strike twice in the bottom half of the 10th inning, they win\nthe ballgame. I thought the ground ball was going to be foul, it stayed\nfair. It went right through the legs of Billy Buckner and down the right\nfield line.\nThorne: Bob, what is Billy Buckner doing in the game in the bottom of 10th\ninning?\nVin Scully.\nThe 1986 World Series was televised by NBC with Vin Scully on the call alongside Joe Garagiola. Scully's call of the final play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited:\nScully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with\nAfter the top of the tenth, NBC began setting up in the visiting clubhouse for what they believed was the inevitable postgame victory celebration by the Boston Red Sox. The Commissioner's Trophy had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the presentation. However, after Bob Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned. Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being \"like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.\"\nAftermath.\nGame 7.\nBoston led Game 7 by a 3–0 score heading into the bottom of the sixth inning when New York rallied again, scoring 3 runs off Bruce Hurst to tie the game, and 3 more off of Schiraldi in the seventh to take a 6–3 lead. Buckner was 2–for–4 in the game, and scored 1 of Boston's 2 runs in the eighth. However, the Mets also scored twice in the eighth and won 8–5, for their second and most recent World Series championship. Mookie Wilson meanwhile, went one for three in Game 7, scoring one of three runs the Mets plated in the sixth inning while trailing 3–0.\nMets' pitcher Jesse Orosco ending the game by striking out Marty Barrett. Orosco then threw his glove high in the air and dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran to the mound to embrace him. This scene was captured on film and would become an iconic image, taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky, in Mets baseball history and in all of baseball. The Mets remained the only team to come within one strike of losing a World Series before recovering to become World Champions, until the St. Louis Cardinals did it in 2011. The Mets winning this World Series is the highest-rated single World Series game to date. The Mets were also the first team to win a World Series in a potential clinching game delayed by rain, as Game 7 was postponed by one day.\nCurses.\nRegardless of any of the other perceived shortcomings that led to Boston's loss in the 1986 World Series, Buckner's error epitomized the \"Curse of the Bambino\" in the minds of Red Sox fans, and he soon became the scapegoat for a frustrated fan base.\nWhile not falling under the curse in the traditional sense, Buckner's infamous gaffe in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series can also be interpreted to fit the Ex-Cubs Factor and/or the Curse of the Billy Goat. Upon video analysis, Buckner, a former Chicago Cub for seven seasons, was shown to be wearing a Cubs batting glove under his mitt when he made the error.\nBuckner, the Red Sox, and the Mets beyond 1986.\nBuckner began receiving death threats and was heckled and booed by some of his own home fans, often with the false belief or implication that his play alone could have instantly won the series for the Red Sox. Meanwhile, he was the focal point of derision from the fans of opposing teams on the road—especially when he faced the Mets in spring training of 1987—and during his first regular-season at bat at Yankee Stadium. He made his 2,500th career hit on May 19, an RBI single in a 4-1 road loss to the Kansas City Royals, but the Red Sox released Buckner on July 23 after he recorded a .273 batting average, 2 home runs, and 42 RBI in 75 games.\nAfter spending his last few seasons with the California Angels, Kansas City Royals, and the Red Sox, Buckner became the 21st player in MLB history to play in four decades. He ended his career with 2,715 hits and 498 doubles, having batted over .300 seven times. Buckner led his league in assists four times, with his 1985 mark remaining the American League (AL) record. He retired with the fourth-most assists by a first baseman (1,351) in major league history despite not playing the position regularly until he was 27 years old. After retiring as a player, Buckner became a real estate developer in Idaho. He coached a number of Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams before leaving baseball in 2014.\nThe Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988. With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Joe Morgan on July 15. Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as \"Morgan Magic\". But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS. Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley, who saved all four wins for Oakland.\nWhile the 1986 Mets were undeniably strong, they also gained infamy for off-the-field controversy. Both Strawberry and Gooden were youngsters who wound up burning out long before their time because of various substance abuse and personal problems. Hernandez's cocaine abuse was the subject of persistent rumors even before he joined the Mets, but he publicly acknowledged his addiction in 1985 and made a successful recovery. Lenny Dykstra's reputation was recently tainted by allegations of steroid use and gambling problems.\nInstead of putting together a winning dynasty, the problems caused the Mets to soon fall apart.\nDespite Darryl Strawberry's numerous off-the-field mishaps, he remains the Mets' all-time leader in home runs and runs batted in.\nThis World Series championship by the Mets had a strange twist: Lou Gorman, the general manager of the Red Sox, was vice president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983. Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.\nReferences in popular culture.\nCharlie Sheen purchased the \"Buckner Ball\" at auction in for $93,000, and for a long time, it resided in the collection of songwriter Seth Swirsky, who refers to it as the \"Mookie Ball.\" The ball was on loan for a time from Swirsky to the Mets to display in their Mets Hall of Fame and Museum, and it was among the most popular artifacts for fans to see. On May 3, 2012, Swirsky sold the ball through Heritage Auctions for $418,250.\nBuckner made a cameo appearance at the beginning of the sports parody film \"The Comebacks\" and\nwas featured in an episode of the HBO series \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" in which he redeems himself by catching a baby thrown from a burning building.”\" Also, he made a cameo appearance in the pilot episode of the short-lived sitcom \"Inside Schwartz\", advising the title character to \"just let it go.\" In 1995, Buckner appeared along with Michael Jordan, Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Ken Griffey Jr. in a commercial for the shoemaker Nike in which Spike Lee, in character as Mars Blackmon, compares Jordan's baseball skills to Musial, Mays, Griffey and Buckner. The punch line is a visual reference to Buckner's 1986 World Series error. His famous 1986 World Series miscue is also referenced in the films \"Celtic Pride\", \"Rounders\", and \"Fever Pitch.\" The play also is referenced in an episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Brother's Little Helper\" and in the musical \"Johnny Baseball\". On October 23, 2008, during former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony in House hearings on the economic crisis of 2008, Representative John Yarmuth referred to Greenspan as one of \"three Bill Buckners.\" Buckner and Mookie Wilson appeared in an MLB Network commercial for the 2016 postseason, \"Catching Up\", marking the 30th anniversary of the 1986 World Series and their roles in it.\nBuckner is mentioned in \"The Areas of My Expertise\" in a series of New England sports references. In the book, John Hodgman describes a (fictional) radio personality and recounts the premonition she had regarding Buckner's infamous error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series.\nThe Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge, in Boston, is colloquially referred to by locals as the Bill Buckner Bridge because traffic goes between the \"legs\" of the bridge, like Buckner's 1986 World Series fielding error. The nickname is now spoken fondly, since Buckner and Sox fans thought fondly of each other after the 2004 World Series win.\nSimilar plays.\nLeon Durham is himself widely remembered for an error that he made at first base during the 1984 National League Championship Series. In the bottom of the seventh inning in the decisive fifth game between Durham's Chicago Cubs and the San Diego Padres, the Padres sent pinch-hitter Tim Flannery to face the Cubs' ace pitcher Rick Sutcliffe.\nThrough the top of the sixth inning, the Cubs had a 3–0 lead, aided by Durham's home run off Eric Show in the first inning. In the bottom of the sixth inning, the Padres cut the Cubs' lead to 3–2 with a pair of singles by Alan Wiggins and Tony Gwynn, a walk to Steve Garvey, and sacrifice flies by Graig Nettles and Terry Kennedy. The bottom of the seventh inning kicked off with Carmelo Martínez walking on four pitches from Sutcliffe. Garry Templeton then sacrificed Martínez to second, setting things up for Tim Flannery. Martinez would then score when Flannery hit a sharp grounder that trickled through Leon Durham's legs for an error.\nThe error became known as the \"Gatorade Glove Play\" because before taking his position in the field that inning, Gatorade was spilled on Durham's glove. Some Cub fans believe the Gatorade spilled on Durham's glove amounted to a curse, similar to the goat and Bartman curses of Cub lore.\nThe play would also turn out to be very similar, in style and effect, to Bill Buckner's much-discussed error in the 1986 World Series. The coincidental connection between these two events is that Durham had been moved from the outfield to first base during the 1984 season, replacing Buckner after the Cubs traded him to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Dennis Eckersley. Buckner's error, like Durham's, would be seen as turning a post-season series around. The same joke even circulated for both incidents: That they had been despondent, jumped in front of a moving truck, and \"the truck went between their legs\".\nThe Padres wound up winning the game 6–3 to reach the World Series for the first time ever. The Cubs had won the first 2 games of the series (1984 marked the last time that the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series) over the Padres. Incidentally, Durham went 3-for-20 in the NLCS, garnering two of his three hits in the final two games on home runs (his shot in Game 4 had given the Cubs a 3–2 lead)."

Unfortunately, the team got off to a dreadful start; the Seawolves won just one of their first 14 games and found themselves at the bottom of the WCHA. The team's outlook began to brighten in December when they won games in three separate weekends, including against ranked Bemidji State.\nAlaska Anchorage continued to show improvement in the second half of the season, playing .500 hockey for two and a half months.

With only two games against arch-rival Alaska remaining, the Seawolves had to win both games to have any chance at extending their season.

        "title": "LIV Golf",
        "text": "LIV Golf ( ) is a professional men's golf tour. The name \"LIV\" refers to the Roman numerals for 54, the number of holes played at LIV events. The first LIV Golf Invitational Series event started on 9 June 2022, at the Centurion Club near St Albans in Hertfordshire, UK. The Invitational Series became the LIV Golf League in 2023.\nLIV Golf is financed by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. Some journalists and commentators have said the tour is part of efforts by the Saudi monarchy, which has been criticized for its corruption and human rights abuses, to improve its public image through sports.\nOrganization.\nThe early framework for a new golf tour to rival the PGA Tour became public in 2019 with announcement of a league to be known as the Premier Golf League. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan responded by implying that golfers who choose to play in a new league would be barred from PGA Tour events. Later in 2020, the PGA European Tour and the PGA Tour formed a \"strategic alliance\" to work together on commercial opportunities, scheduling, and prize funds for each tour's membership.\nThe Premier Golf League held talks with Saudi investors about a financial partnership, but Golf Saudi (a division of the Public Investment Fund) instead funded a new entity in 2020 which had its own plan to establish a global professional league, often referred to as the \"Super Golf League\". This entity formally launched in October 2021 as LIV Golf Investments, with former professional golfer Greg Norman named as CEO.\nLIV Golf has often been described as the golfing equivalent to the dormant breakaway European Super League in football.\nIn July 2022, LIV Golf formally applied to be included in the Official World Golf Ranking, a process which typically takes between a year and two years from application submission to approval and awarding of OWGR points. In October 2022, LIV Golf entered into a \"strategic alliance\" with the MENA Tour. The arrangement was conceived in order to immediately afford LIV Golf events ranking points; however, it was subsequently confirmed that events in 2022 would not receive points as changes to the MENA Tour would need to be reviewed.\nFormat.\nThe inaugural season of the LIV Golf Invitational Series featured eight 54-hole no-cut stroke play tournaments and a final Team Championship, set to be a \"seeded four-day, four-round, match play knock-out\" event held at Trump National Doral Miami in October 2022.\nIn June 2022, it was reported that LIV Golf would evolve the following year into a league format with a 14-event schedule and 48 contracted players. On 27 July 2022, Norman announced that LIV Golf would implement a promotion and relegation system, featuring a rankings list and a four-player relegation out of the 48 contracted players. The league has a prize fund of $405 million. Its events are scheduled to avoid conflicting with major championships, the PGA Tour's premier tournaments, and international team events.\nBroadcasting rights.\nThe 2022 LIV Golf Invitational Series was streamed live on Facebook and YouTube.\nIn June 2022, LIV Golf signed a worldwide broadcasting deal with video streaming service DAZN. Additional deals were signed the following months, including ServusTV in Germany and Austria, Eleven Sports in Italy, Claro Sports in Latin America, GameTV nationally across Canada and CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\nUnited States.\nIn January 2023, LIV signed their first national broadcasting deal in the United States with The CW, a broadcast network controlled by Nexstar Media Group. While the network has secured full national distribution for these telecasts, in many media markets—including those where the CW network affiliates were owned by CBS News and Stations (as CBS Sports is a rightsholder of the PGA Tour) or are owned by Tegna and Lilly Broadcasting—the network had to find alternate affiliates to carry the telecasts, including several other Nexstar-owned stations.\nPlayer signups.\nOn 1 June 2022, the field was released for the first event, to be played at the Centurion Club. The list included several major champions and former world number ones: Dustin Johnson, Sergio García, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell, Louis Oosthuizen, Charl Schwartzel and Lee Westwood. One source said Johnson winner of two major championships and a former World No. 1 was paid US$150 million to play in the LIV series. Johnson, who had won 24 PGA events and $74 million since 2008, announced his resignation from the PGA Tour on 7 June 2022, saying, \"I chose what's best for me and my family.\" Ian Poulter was reportedly offered £22 million (US$30 million) to join the league. Lee Westwood said that he had signed a non-disclosure agreement relating to the topic.\nOn 4 June 2022, Kevin Na became the first member of the PGA Tour to resign to participate in LIV Golf, saying, \"If I exercise my right to choose where and when I play golf, then I cannot remain a PGA Tour player without facing disciplinary proceedings and legal action from the PGA Tour... I hope the current policies change and I'll be able to play on the PGA Tour again.\" Reigning U.S. Amateur champion James Piot, who turned professional in May 2022, chose to play in the first LIV Golf tournament without having joined the PGA Tour.\nIn a \"Washington Post\" interview published on 5 June 2022, LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman said that Tiger Woods had declined to join, turning down a deal that was \"mind-blowingly enormous; we're talking about high nine digits.\"\nBefore the second event in Portland, LIV Golf announced further signings, including several players in the top-50 of the world rankings, and three more major champions: Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, and Patrick Reed. During that event, it was announced that Paul Casey would play in the third event in Bedminster. Further signings before Bedminster included European Ryder Cup captain Henrik Stenson, who was removed from the role before the move was announced. In August 2022, before the fourth event in Boston, LIV Golf announced that six more players had joined, including Open champion and world number two Cameron Smith and Chilean world number 19 Joaquín Niemann. \nAfter 2022, LIV Golf continued recruiting new players for its golf league. Before the 2023 LIV Golf League, Danny Lee, Thomas Pieters, Mito Pereira, Sebastian Munoz were among the players who joined the circuit. No new signings were announced during the 2023 season. In December 2023, reigning Masters champion Jon Rahm signed with LIV Golf and was given ownership in a new expansion team, later named Legion XIII. To fill his team, Rahm signed Tyrrell Hatton and Caleb Surratt to LIV Golf, along with adding Kieran Vincent, who gained membership via the 2023 LIV Golf Promotions event.\nReaction.\nLIV Golf is financed by the Public Investment Fund, the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. Some journalists and commentators have said the tour is part of efforts by the Saudi monarchy, which has been criticized for its corruption and human rights abuses, to improve its public image through sports.\nHuman rights groups have criticized LIV Golf as sportswashing, a political strategy by Saudi Arabia to cleanse its repressive global image through sport. Human Rights Watch called the Saudi endeavour \"an effort to distract from its serious human rights abuses by taking over events that celebrate human achievement\".\nGreg Norman has been accused of aiding the repressive Saudi government for his own financial gain. In 2021, Norman denied that he was being used for sportswashing and said he works for LIV because of his passion for the sport. Later, in May 2022, Norman defended the involvement of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with Jamal Khashoggi's murder, saying, \"Look, we've all made mistakes, and you just want to learn from those mistakes and how you can correct them going forward.\" His statement drew extensive criticism. Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, said it was hurtful that \"Jamal's brutal killing is brushed off as a 'mistake' and that we should just move on\".\nOn 22 June 2022, a group of nearly 2,500 survivors of family members killed or injured during the September 11 attacks wrote an open letter to golfers who have remained loyal to the PGA Tour thanking them for not defecting to LIV Golf. The letter read in part, \"Thank you for standing up for decency. Thank you for standing up for the 9/11 Families. Thank you for resisting the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's efforts to cleanse its reputation by buying off professional athletes...To those of you who have chosen what is right over blood money from a corrupt, destructive sports entity and its Saudi backers, please continue to stand strong.\" On 17 July 2022, a group of September 11 victims' family members condemned former U.S. President Donald Trump for hosting the LIV Golf tour at his Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey; the group's letter to Trump noted that he himself had blamed Saudi Arabia for the 9/11 attack during a 2016 interview on Fox News.\nTiger Woods, who turned down an offer of $700 million to $800 million to join LIV Golf, was asked in July 2022 about the golfers who had joined. \"I disagree with it. I think that what they've done is they've turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position,\" Woods said at a press conference before the 2022 Open Championship. \"I know what the PGA Tour stands for and what we have done and what the tour has given us, the ability to chase after our careers and to earn what we get and the trophies we have been able to play for and the history that has been a part of this game.\"\nPGA Tour.\nThe PGA Tour announced that its members who participate in LIV Golf events could be sanctioned for playing in a conflicting event without the Tour's permission, which could result in fines, suspensions, or bans. On 9 June 2022, the PGA Tour announced that its members participating in the first LIV Golf tournament (including current members as well as those who had recently resigned) were no longer eligible to compete in tour events or the Presidents Cup. By contrast, the constitution of the European Tour does not provide for banning players who enter conflicting events.\nOn 11 July 2022, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that the United States Department of Justice was investigating the PGA Tour to determine if they have engaged in anti-competitive behavior with LIV Golf. In August 2022, LIV Golf and several players brought an antitrust civil suit against the PGA Tour, which countersued that LIV Golf was encouraging PGA players to break their existing contracts. Jury selection for the upcoming trial was scheduled to take place in January 2024.\nIn September 2022, \"Sports Illustrated\" reported that the PGA Tour had sent letters to Japan Golf Tour members notifying them that the PGA Tour would exclude LIV Golf players from their co-sanctioned events, such as the Zozo Championship, even if they were not members of the PGA Tour. \"Sports Illustrated\" speculated that the letters were the reason that all four Japanese players who had played in earlier events had withdrawn from the series prior to the fourth event in Boston, reporting that the letters had been sent to PGA Tour members who had joined LIV Golf but not resigned their membership of the PGA Tour advising them that their membership would \"not be renewed for the 2022–23 season\".\nEuropean Tour.\nIn June 2022, the PGA and European tours announced a strengthening of their \"strategic alliance\", with the PGA Tour increasing their stake in European Tour Productions to 40% and further changes being made to the European Tour, including increased prize funds and leading players in the DP World Tour Rankings gaining PGA Tour cards for the following season.\nThe European Tour did not take any disciplinary action until the end of June, when it was announced that LIV Golf participants would be fined and suspended from the European Tour's three PGA Tour co-sanctioned events. Several players, including Ian Poulter, took legal action and the suspensions were put on hold, allowing them to play in the Genesis Scottish Open and subsequent tour events pending a full hearing, which was scheduled by Sport Resolutions UK for February 2023. On 20 June 2022, the tour removed Henrik Stenson as captain of the European Ryder Cup team as a result of his decision to join LIV Golf.\nProposed merger of commercial rights of LIV, PGA and European Tours.\nOn 6 June 2023, LIV Golf, the PGA Tour, and PGA European Tour announced that the three organizations would pool their commercial rights into a new for-profit venture, which would be funded by the Public Investment Fund. The announcement stated that the merger is intended to \"unify the game of golf on a global basis\" and \"ensure that all stakeholders benefit from a model that delivers maximum excitement and competition among the game's best players.\" Current PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan will serve as CEO of the new entity, with Yasir Al-Rumayyan as chairman, and the PGA Tour appointing the majority of its board. All three tours will maintain administrative oversight and sanctioning of their events. This agreement ends all existing litigation, and there are plans for a \"fair and objective process for any players who desire to re-apply for membership\". The agreement was controversial among some PGA Tour players.\nThe deadline for completing the deal was December 31, 2023, although it was reported that the parties were attempting to negotiate an extension. On January 31, 2024, the PGA Tour announced an investment into its for-profit arm—PGA Tour Enterprises—by a Fenway Sports Group-backed consortium of U.S. professional sports owners. Strategic Sports Group would pay $1.5 billion initially, and then a second $1.5 billion following the conclusion of negotiations between the PGA Tour and the Saudi Public Investment Fund. In addition, active players would be given an opportunity to receive grants of equity in PGA Tour Enterprises.\nTrademark issues.\nIn March 2023, LIV Miami—a David Grutman-founded nightclub that is among the highest grossing in the United States—filed a Notice of Opposition seeking to block a U.S. trademark registration by LIV Golf, citing that its marks \"are visually, phonetically, and aurally similar and the goods/services share similarities\", and that it would \"dilute the distinctive quality\" of its brand. LIV in Miami opened in 2008, with its name referring to its location—the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel—having originally opened in 1954.\nLIV Golf seasons.\n2022 season.\nOn 17 March 2022, the first eight tournament schedule with prize money of $255 million was announced by Greg Norman. The no cut 54-hole tournaments feature 48 players drafted into 12 four-man teams, with shotgun starts. The first seven events have $20 million purses with an additional $5 million split among the top three teams each week; a team championship concludes the schedule with $30 million on offer to the top three players and an additional $50 million in team prizes.\n2023 season.\nThe season was renamed as the LIV Golf League for the 2023 season having previously been the LIV Golf Invitational Series. In January 2023, the schedule for the second LIV Golf season was released. The season consisted of 14 no cut 54-hole tournaments. There were several different locations and golf courses in the 2023 season, including new venues in the U.S., Mexico, Singapore, and Australia. The individual championship was won by Talor Gooch and the team championship was won by Crushers GC.\n2024 season.\nThe 2024 season began in February 2024. The season consists again of 14 no cut 54-hole tournaments. New locations on the schedule for the season will include West Virginia, Nashville, Las Vegas, Houston, and Hong Kong. At the end of the season, a new individual championship will be held, in addition to the team championship that has been held each of the first two seasons. As of 11 December 2023, details about the format of the individual championship have not been released. Newcomers for the 2024 season include PGA Tour winner Tyrell Hatton and two-time major champion Jon Rahm.\nCareer money leaders.\nThe top ten career money leaders on the tour, after the 2023 season, are as follows:\nThe figures above include all prize money won by the golfers, including individual winnings, team earnings, and bonuses earned based on their finish in the individual and team standings. It does not include other money earned as part of their contracts with their teams and LIV Golf."

        "title": "2020 Dominic Thiem tennis season",
        "text": "The 2020 Dominic Thiem tennis season saw the Austrian tennis player win 25 matches with 9 losses, earning over six million dollars in prize money, and recording his first Grand Slam title at the 2020 US Open. He began the season ranked fourth on the ATP Tour, and finished the season ranked third. \nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nATP Cup.\nThiem started his 2020 season at the ATP Cup as a part of the Austrian squad. He played alongside Dennis Novak, Sebastian Ofner, Jürgen Melzer, and his doubles partner Oliver Marach. Thomas Muster was captain. In his first match, Thiem lost to Borna Ćorić in three tight sets. Team Austria lost their match 0-3 against Team Croatia. Thiem won his second match over Argentine Diego Schwartzman in straight sets. Team Austria needed to defeat Team Poland to advance to the quarterfinals. Dennis Novak lost the first match, and Thiem needed a win against Hubert Hurkacz to keep their hopes alive. He lost the match in three sets, and Team Austria was eliminated.\nAustralian Open.\nBefore the Australian Open began, Thiem participated in AO Rally for Relief, a fundraising exhibition to help victims of the bushfires in Australia. He was a part of Team Serena Williams alongside Petra Kvitova, Novak Djokovic, and Rafael Nadal. The fundraising effort brought in almost five million dollars.\nThiem was seeded fifth for the main draw. He beat Adrian Mannarino in the first round in three sets, and won his second round match over wildcard player Alex Bolt in five sets. In the third round he beat Taylor Fritz in four sets, and in round four defeated Gaël Monfils in three straight sets to reach his first Australian Open quarterfinal. In the quarterfinal, Thiem met the top seed and number one player in the world, Rafael Nadal, and won this match in four tight sets 7–6(7-3), 7–6(7-4), 4–6, 7–6(8-6). In the semifinals Thiem faced Alexander Zverev. After a poor start, Thiem recovered and won the match in four sets, reaching his third Grand Slam final. In the final he met seven-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic. After Thiem lost the opening set, he won sets two and three. Djokovic won the fourth set to send the match to a decisive fifth set. An early break for Djokovic and almost perfect serving games decided the match and Djokovic successfully defended his title, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.\nAmerican Swing.\nRio de Janeiro.\nThiem's next tournament was on the clay court surfaces at the Rio Open. After a three set win over Felipe Meligeni Alves and a win over the Spaniard Jaume Munar, he lost in the quarterfinals to qualifier Gianluca Mager in straight sets. Thiem withdrew from the Mexican Open in Acapulco and prepared to defend his ATP Masters title in Indian Wells, California.\nOn 2 March, he was third overall in the ATP rankings.\nSeason hiatus.\nOn March 8, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season went on hiatus for several months. The following measures were taken:\nAmerican outdoor hardcourt season.\nCincinnati Masters.\nAfter being on hiatus for five months due to COVID-19, the ATP tour resumed play in August with the Cincinnati Masters, although this year it would be played in New York. \nThiem was seeded second in the draw and had a bye for the first round. He lost in the second round to Filip Krajinović, 6-2, 6-1.\nUS Open.\nThiem entered the US Open as the second seed. In the first round, he faced Jaume Munar, who retired after two sets. In round two Thiem beat Sumit Nagal 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. 2014 US Open-winner Marin Čilić was Thiem's opponent in round three, and Thiem won in four sets, 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. Thiem defeated Félix Auger-Aliassime in straight sets in the fourth round (7-6, 6-1, 6-1) and reached his second US Open quarterfinal. In the quarterfinals, he beat Alex de Minaur 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. In the semifinals he met 2019 US Open finalist, Daniil Medvedev. Thiem won the first set easily, and came from behind to win the second and third sets in tiebreakers. Thiem won the match to reach his fourth Grand Slam final, 6–2, 7–6(9-7), 7-6(7-5). \nThiem's opponent in the finals was Alex Zverev. Zverev took the first two sets 6-2, 6-4, and had the advantage after breaking Thiem's serve early in the third set. Thiem broke right back to even the set, and after five games of held serves Thiem broke Zverev again to take the set, 6-4. Thiem took the fourth set 6-3, leading to a decisive fifth set.\nThiem and Zverev traded breaks in the first two games of the fifth set before Zverev broke Thiem again and took a commanding 5-3 lead. Thiem broke Zverev to make it 5-4, held serve, and broke Zverev again to have a chance to serve for the match at 6-5. Thiem took a medical timeout for a thigh injury and was then broken by Zverev to go to 6-6. The ensuing tiebreak was the first in Open Era history in a US Open final. Thiem led the tiebreak 6–4 to get two Championship points. He took control in the tiebreak and on the third championship point, an errant Zverev backhand meant Thiem won the tiebreak, set, and match (2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6(8-6)). The victory gave Thiem his first Grand Slam title, and he became the first man born in the 1990s to win a Grand Slam, as well as the first player since 2004 to come back from two sets behind to win a Grand Slam.\nRoland Garros and late indoor season.\nFrench Open.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the French Open was rescheduled, moving from its usual start date in May to a late September start, just two weeks after the US Open. Thiem was seeded third, and in the first three rounds he defeated Marin Čilić, Jack Sock and Casper Ruud, all in straight sets. In the round of 16 he beat French wildcard entry Hugo Gaston in five sets. By beating Gaston, Thiem earned his fifth straight trip to the Roland Garros quarterfinals. There he faced Diego Schwartzman, and lost after a five-hour battle with three tiebreaks in five sets, 6–7(1–7), 7–5, 7–6(8–6), 6–7(5–7), 2–6.\nVienna Open.\nA month after Roland Garros, Thiem was seeded second for a title defense at his home tournament, the Vienna Open. He won the opening round over Vitaliy Sachko, followed by a victory over Cristian Garín, both in straight sets. In the quarterfinals he was beaten by eventual-champion Andrey Rublev in two sets. After the match he withdrew from the Rolex Paris Masters, citing problems with foot blisters.\nATP finals.\nThe 2020 ATP Finals were held in the O2 Arena in London from 15 to 22 November. The tournament features eight players, split into two groups of four for round-robin play, followed by knockout play amongst the top four. Thiem was drawn to a group with Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Rublev. Thiem beat defending champion Tsitsipas in three tight sets, 7-6(7-5), 4-6, 6-3. In the second match he beat Rafael Nadal in two tiebreakers, 7-6(9-7), 7-6(6-4). Thiem lost his final robin-round match to Rublev in straight sets, but qualified to advance to the knockout rounds. In the semifinals he faced Djokovic. He won the opening set 7-5 and had a match point in the second set, but lost the set in a tiebreak. In the final set he was down 0–4 in a tiebreak, but came back and won the final tiebreak, 7-5. This was Thiem's second straight appearance in the ATP Finals championship, having lost to Tsitsipas in the finals in 2019. This year he faced Daniil Medvedev. Thiem took the first set, but dropped the next two, ending the tournament as runner-up and closing out the 2020 season.\nAll matches.\nThis table lists all the matches of Thiem in 2020, including walkovers (W/O)."

He was a member of United States national team at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nPlaying career.\nHentges was a star forward for his high school team, Totino-Grace High School, averaging more than two points per game as a senior. He was less effective during his only season of junior hockey, which was split between two teams, but was still thought of well enough for the Minnesota Wild to select him in the NHL Draft. The following year, he debuted for St. Cloud State. While providing secondary scoring for the Huskies, he helped the team finish atop the NCHC standings. While the team lost in the conference championship game, they still received the top overall seed and were set against the lowest-ranked team for their first game in the NCAA Tournament. Hentges couldn't stop one of the more stunning upsets in NCAA history when St. Cloud State fell to American International, 1–2.\nHentges increased his standing on the Huskies during his sophomore season, though the team wasn't nearly as dominant. St. Cloud finished 5th in the conference; however, before their postseason began, the entire college hockey season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the start of the following season was delayed for the same reason, Hentges didn't get off to a great start offensively. He did, however, help lead the team through an uncertain season and finish 2nd in the NCHC. After finishing as the NCHC runner-up, St. Cloud received a second seed and made up for their dismal performance in 2019 by reaching their first championship game. Hentges only recorded a single assist in the four games.\nFor his senior season, Hentges missed the first two months with upper- and lower-body injuries. His first game action came on the final day of the year and, even after the NHL announced that they wouldn't be sending any players to the Winter Olympics, Hentges didn't think he had a chance to make the team. However, after his head coach, Brett Larson, was named as an assistant coach for the United States national team, Hentges was invited to join the squad. He played in two games while the team finished in a disappointing 5th place.\nAfter completing his collegiate career, Hentges was signed to a two-year, entry-level contract with the Minnesota Wild on March 29, 2022."

The flag bearers from each participating country entered the stadium informally in single file, and behind them marched all the athletes. The flags of each country were not necessarily carried by the same flag bearer as in the opening ceremony. \nParade order.\nAthletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by the Olympic tradition. As the originator of the Olympics, the Greek flag bearer entered first. The country that will host the next Winter Olympics, Italy, marched before the host nation China entered, instead of entering between New Zealand and Serbia, according to the Chinese collation order.\nCountries marched in order of the Chinese language. The collation method used was based on the names as written in Simplified Chinese characters and is similar to that used in Chinese dictionaries. The names were sorted by the number of strokes in the first character of the name, then by the stroke order of the character (in the order 橫竖撇捺折, c.f. Wubi method), then the number of strokes and stroke order of the second character, then next character and so on. For example, this placed San Marino () in 28th position, just ahead of Kyrgyzstan () because the initial character for \"San Marino\" () is written in 5 strokes, while that for \"Kyrgyzstan\" () is written in 6 strokes.\nList.\nThe following is a list of each country's flag bearer. The list is sorted by the sequence that each nation appeared in the Ceremony. The names are given in their official designations by the IOC, and the Chinese names follow their official designations by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games."

The 1998 World Cup was the first tournament sanctioned by the IRB.\nNew Zealand is the most successful team in the tournament by far. They have won six titles with four back-to-back victories from 1998 to 2010. England follow with two titles and the United States with one. Canada has appeared in a final only once in 2014.\nHistory.\nThe United States and England contested the first women's final in April 1991. England was in the lead 6–3 at halftime with a converted penalty try by Gill Burns. However a resurgent US team ran in 16 unanswered points to claim the inaugural title.\nThe 1994 World Cup was held three years later to avoid coinciding with the men's World Cup. The two finalists of the 1991 World Cup seemed destined to repeat their earlier encounter. After a very entertaining match England were the second team to win the trophy.\n1998 saw a new champion in New Zealand as they dominated the United States in the final with eight tries. It was the first of four consecutive titles that New Zealand would win, but not without a fight from the English.\nEngland eventually won their second title in 2014 with a shocking exit of New Zealand in the pool stage. Canada made their first appearance in a final before succumbing to England.\nNew Zealand returned to the final in 2017, playing defending champions England, it was a closely contested match with an aggregate of 73 points by the two teams. New Zealand won their fifth title.\nThe 2021 competition was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and produced a repeat of the 2017 final as hosts and reigning champions New Zealand faced England. England came into the match on a winning streak of 30 matches and took an early lead before Lydia Thompson was sent off for a high tackle. England preserved their lead at 26–19 at half-time but their 14 players were ultimately unable to contain New Zealand, who finally took the lead with a 71st minute try by Ayesha Leti-I'iga.

Kenya's Jonathan Korir held the fastest personal best in the field; 2:04:32 achieved in Amsterdam in 2021 but his best time for 2022 was 2:08:04 at the Tokyo Marathon on 6 March. Ugandan Victor Kiplangat ran 2:05:09 in Hamburg which gave him the fastest season best in the field. Dewi Griffiths, Stephen Scullion and Motlokoa Nkhaunutlane all had personal bests under 2:10 while the sole Englishman, Jonny Mellor had run 2:10:46 in the trials for the games in Manchester. Other runners in the field included Australians Andrew Buchanan and Liam Adams who had personal bests of 2:12:23 and 2:10:48, respectively, Lesotho runners Lebenya Nkoka and Tsepo Mathibelle and Northern Irish runner Kevin Seaward. Paul Pollock was due to race but pulled out due to injury before the start. Athletics Weekly predicted a top three finish of Simbu, Korir and Kiplangat in times of 2:09:45, 2:09:50 and 2:10:15, respectively. they also noted a lack of \"quality of depth\" in the field while suggesting that Kenya had struggled to find athletes to compete.\nCourse.\nThe marathon distance is long as sanctioned by World Athletics. The course started in Smithfield, Birmingham, headed down Sherlock Street and on to Pershore Road (A441). Passing Edgbaston Stadium, the course took a detour through Cannon Hill Park before rejoining Pershore Road and continuing in a southerly direction. The course left Pershore Road and passed through Bournville and by Cadbury World, took a turn on to Heath Road then Kingsley Road, Woodlands Park Road, Hay Green Lane, and back on to Bournville Lane to head north back through Bournville. The course rejoined Pershore Road via Warwards Lane and headed in the opposite direction up to the roundabout where the road meets Sherlock Street. At the roundabout the runners would make a u-turn to repeat the above section for a second time. When reaching the roundabout again, the runners would proceed on to Sherlock Street, then take a left on to Hurst Street towards the city centre. The course then passed by the town hall and the central library before heading into the Jewellery Quarter via Newhall Hill and Frederick Street.

The event took place on May 8, 2022, at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island, and was the third Backlash held at this venue after the 1999 and 2009 events. It was also the second and final Backlash held under this name, after the previous year's event, as the following year, the event reverted to its original name. This was also the last Backlash held in the Continental United States.The concept of the 2022 event was based around the backlash from WrestleMania 38.\nSix matches were contested at the event. In the main event, The Bloodline (Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, and Jimmy Uso) defeated Drew McIntyre and RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) in a six-man tag team match. In other prominent matches, Ronda Rousey defeated Charlotte Flair in an \"I Quit\" match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship, Edge defeated AJ Styles by technical submission, and in the opening bout, Cody Rhodes defeated Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins. This was the first pay-per-view to not feature a WWE Championship or Universal Championship match on the card since Elimination Chamber in March 2020.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nBacklash is a recurring professional wrestling event that was established by WWE in 1999. It was held annually from 1999 to 2009, but was then discontinued until it was reinstated in 2016 and has been held every year since, except in 2019. The original concept of the event was based around the backlash from WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania. The events between 2016 and 2020 did not carry this theme; however, the 2021 event returned to this original concept and the event was in turn rebranded as \"WrestleMania Backlash\".\nOn October 25, 2021, WWE revealed their 2022 major event calendar for the Raw and SmackDown brands, with an event slotted for May 8, 2022, at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. On February 11, 2022, that event was revealed to be the 17th Backlash, which was also held under the name \"WrestleMania Backlash\", and featured the backlash from WrestleMania 38. This was also the third Backlash held at this venue after the 1999 and 2009 events. It aired on pay-per-view (PPV) worldwide and was available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets. Tickets went on sale February 18 through Ticketmaster.\nStorylines.\nThe event included six matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"Friday Night SmackDown\".\nAt WrestleMania 38, SmackDown's Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated Raw's WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to claim both titles, thus becoming recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Reigns stated that he had nothing left to prove; however, he wanted his cousins, the SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), to replicate his feat by winning the Raw Tag Team Championship to bring more gold to The Bloodline. The Usos appeared on \"Raw\" the following week to issue a challenge to the Raw Tag Team Champions, RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle), who accepted and the match was made official as a Winners Take All Championship Unification match at WrestleMania Backlash. However, on the April 29 episode, the contract signing for the match ended with Reigns assisting The Usos in attacking RK-Bro and tearing up the contract in the process. Drew McIntyre then came out and joined forces with RK-Bro in driving off The Bloodline from the ring. Because of what had transpired, Reigns' special counsel, Paul Heyman, then met with WWE official Adam Pearce backstage where Heyman announced that the resulting tag team championship unification match was called off and instead, a six-man tag team match pitting The Bloodline against RK-Bro and McIntyre was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt WrestleMania 38, Charlotte Flair defeated Ronda Rousey to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship. During the match, Flair had tapped out to Rousey's armbar; however, the referee was incapacitated and Flair was able to get a cheap win after the referee came to his senses. On the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Rousey, who wanted a rematch with a clear winner, challenged Flair to an \"I Quit\" match. Flair refused and told Rousey to fall back in line. During \"Talking Smack\" the next day, however, the championship rematch was subsequently granted and scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt WrestleMania 38, former All Elite Wrestling wrestler and Executive Vice President Cody Rhodes made his return to WWE after six years as Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins' surprise opponent, where Rhodes was victorious. On the April 11 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins claimed that he was at an unfair disadvantage since he did not know who he was facing beforehand. Rollins further claimed that on an even playing field, he would defeat Rhodes and challenged him to a rematch, which Rhodes accepted and thus was scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt WrestleMania 38, Edge defeated AJ Styles thanks to a distraction from Damian Priest. Edge and Priest then formed an alliance where Edge claimed to wipe out anyone who did not fit in their \"Mountain of Omnipotence\". On the April 18 episode of \"Raw\", Edge stated that he needed to finish what he started with Styles and then challenged Styles to a rematch at WrestleMania Backlash, with Styles later accepting. On the May 2 episode of \"Raw\", Styles defeated Priest, thus banning Priest from ringside during the match.\nDuring Happy Corbin's match at WrestleMania 38, he was accidentally distracted by his tag partner, Madcap Moss, which resulted in a loss for Corbin. Following this, dissension arose between Corbin and Moss, with Corbin blaming Moss for his loss at WrestleMania. Tension continued to grow between the two and a match between the two was eventually scheduled for WrestleMania Backlash.\nAt WrestleMania 38, Bobby Lashley defeated Omos; oddly, Lashley's manager MVP did not accompany him for the match. MVP returned the next night on \"Raw\" and turned on Lashley. Over the next few weeks, MVP lambasted Lashley for celebrating his WrestleMania moment without him and thus, MVP aligned himself with Omos. Lashley and Omos then competed in an arm wrestling match on the April 25 episode, which ended in Lashley's favor. Omos then attacked Lashley after the contest and later challenged him to a WrestleMania rematch at WrestleMania Backlash, and Lashley accepted.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view opened with Cody Rhodes facing Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins. During the match, Rollins attempted a Suicide Dive, but Rhodes avoided it and performed a Cody Cutter on Rollins for a nearfall. Rollins attempted a Phoenix Splash, but Rhodes avoided it. Rollins landed on his feet and Rhodes performed a Superkick on Rollins. Rhodes went up to the top rope and was cut off by Rollins, who superplexed him. Rollins rolled through to go for a Falcon Arrow, but Rhodes countered into a Cross Rhodes. Rhodes pinned Rollins, but Rollins' foot ended up on the bottom rope, thus breaking the pin. Rhodes attempted a Vertebreaker; however, Rollins reversed into a roll-up while attempting to hold Rhodes' tights, but Rhodes reversed into his own roll-up while holding Rollins' tights to win the match.\nNext, Bobby Lashley faced Omos (accompanied by MVP). Throughout the match, Lashley managed to apply the Hurt Lock on Omos momentarily, but Omos was able break out of the maneuver. Lashley attempted a vertical suplex on Omos, who ran the ropes and performed a Spinebuster on Lashley. In the climax, Lashley attempted a Spear, but Omos caught him with his knees and sent Lashley to the ring post. While the referee was distracted, MVP struck Lashley in the face with his cane, allowing Omos to perform the Choke Bomb on Lashley to win the match.\nThe third match was between AJ Styles and Edge, with Damian Priest barred from ringside. At the start of the match, Styles went after Edge aggressively with punches. Styles dropkicked Edge to the floor, and performed an Asai Moonsault on Edge. Back in the ring, as Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm, Edge cut him off with a boot to Styles' injured shoulder. A short time later after Edge targeted Styles' injured shoulder, Styles performed a Pele Kick on Edge. Styles ran the ropes, leading to both men hitting a cross body block to each other at the same time. Styles charged at Edge, who performed a Spear for a nearfall. As Styles went up the rope, Damian Priest walked out and stood in the aisle. Priest claimed he was technically only at the aisle and not the ringside. Finn Bálor then ran out and brawled with Priest, taking him out of the arena. In the closing moments, a masked person shoved Styles off the top rope. Edge applied a Crossface on Styles, who passed out, thus winning the match. Post-match, the masked person joined Edge in the ring. The latter dropped to one knee in front of him, with Edge motioning for the person to stand up. The masked person revealed herself to be Rhea Ripley, thus being added to Edge's stable, The Judgment Day. Edge and Ripley held up their arms and celebrated the victory.\nAfter that, Charlotte Flair defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Ronda Rousey in an \"I Quit\" match. Early in the match, Flair performed a German Suplex on Rousey. At ringside, Flair pulled a kendo stick underneath the ring. Rousey took the weapon from her and chased Flair, who ran up to the stage and went to the back. Flair returned with two kendo sticks and hit Rousey with the sticks. Flair grabbed a camera and threw it towards Rousey, who then hopped the barricade and fought with Flair in the crowd. Back in the ring, Flair performed the Natural Selection on Rousey onto the chair. Flair applied the Figure Eight Leglock, but Rousey used the chair to break free. Rousey reached up and hooked Flair in an armbar through the chair. Flair declined to quit, causing Rousey to twist the arm of Flair and making Flair say \"I Quit\", thus Rousey won the SmackDown Women's Championship. It was soon after revealed that Flair had (kayfabe) broken her radial bone in her forearm and would be out of action indefinitely.\nIn the penultimate match, Happy Corbin faced Madcap Moss. During the match, Corbin performed a senton bomb on Moss for a nearfall. Corbin stuffed a shoulder block by hitting Moss with a knee to the head. Moss performed a fallaway slam on Corbin for a nearfall. In the end, Moss ran the ropes and performed a Sunset Flip to win the match.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Drew McIntyre and RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) faced The Bloodline (Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, and Jimmy Uso) (accompanied by Paul Heyman) in a six-man tag team match. During the match, Reigns and McIntyre brawled in the ring. As Reigns knocked Riddle off the apron, McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Reigns. Riddle performed a Floating Bro on Jey for a nearfall. Jey performed an Elevated neckbreaker on Riddle, but Orton broke up the pin. At ringside, Reigns leapt off the ring steps and performed a Superman Punch on Orton. McIntyre attempted a Powerbomb on Reigns through the announce table, but Jimmy saved Reigns and took a Glasgow Kiss from McIntyre. Reigns took advantage and performed an Uranage Slam on McIntyre. Back in the ring, Riddle performed an RKO on Jey from the top rope. Reigns had made a quick tag before Riddle performed the RKO, thus after Riddle stood up, Reigns performed a Spear on Riddle to win the match.\nAftermath.\nThe 2022 Backlash would be the final to carry the name \"WrestleMania Backlash\", as the following year's event returned the event to its original \"Backlash\" name.\nRaw.\nOn the following episode of \"Raw\", Cody Rhodes was given a United States Championship match against Theory. During the match, Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins interfered, costing Rhodes the match by disqualification. Rhodes then challenged Rollins to another match, but this time as a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell, which Rollins accepted.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Rhea Ripley explained that she joined Judgment Day to become better. She then defeated Liv Morgan. Damian Priest then faced Finn Bálor, which ended in a disqualification win for Bálor after interference from Edge. AJ Styles then attacked Edge, but Judgment Day gained the upper hand. On the May 16 episode, Morgan was at ringside during Styles and Bálor's match, which Styles and Bálor won. The following week, Ripley and Priest defeated Styles and Morgan after interference from Edge. After the match, a brawl between the two teams broke out, with Judgment Day standing tall again. On the May 30 episode, a six-person mixed tag team match pitting Morgan, Styles, and Bálor against The Judgment Day was made official for Hell in a Cell. Also on that same episode, Morgan defeated Ripley, and after the match, Bálor and Styles took out Priest.\nMVP hosted a segment of the VIP Lounge, praising Omos for his victory over Bobby Lashley. Lashley interrupted, but was attacked by Cedric Alexander, who wanted to rejoin MVP and reform The Hurt Business. Omos and MVP retreated while Lashley applied the Hurt Lock on Alexander. Later, Lashley said the only reason he did not defeat Omos at WrestleMania Backlash was due to MVP's interference and a rematch between Omos and Lashley was scheduled for the following week as a Steel Cage match, which Lashley won. The following week, Lashley challenged MVP to a match where the winner would choose the stipulation of his match against Omos at Hell in a Cell. MVP defeated Lashley via countout after interference from Omos. Omos and MVP then stated that the match would be a 2-on-1 handicap match pitting Lashley against MVP and Omos.\nSmackDown.\nRaw Tag Team Champions RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) appeared on the following \"SmackDown\" to challenge the SmackDown Tag Team Champions, The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), to the title unification match that was originally going to happen at WrestleMania Backlash. The Usos accepted and the match was scheduled for the following week, where The Usos won after Roman Reigns prevented Jey from being hit by Riddle's top-rope RKO (while Reigns' special counsel Paul Heyman distracted the referee), followed by Jey performing a top-rope Uso splash, to become the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions. Afterwards, The Usos and Reigns continued their attack, ending with Jey performing an Uso Splash on Riddle through the announce table. Reigns and the Usos then held their titles up high as \"SmackDown\" went off the air.\nAfter The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated RK-Bro (Randy Orton and Riddle) to become the Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions, it was reported that Orton had suffered a legitimate back injury and would be out of action for the rest of 2022. On the May 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", Shinsuke Nakamura, whose tag team partner, Rick Boogs, was also out of action due to an injury, joined forces with Riddle and attacked The Usos, who were able to retreat. On the next episode of \"Raw\", Nakamura and Riddle defeated The Usos via disqualification when Jey used a scooter. As a result, Nakamura and Riddle earned themselves a title match. The match took place on the June 3 episode of \"SmackDown\", where The Usos retained after Sami Zayn, who had repeatedly been lobbying for an alliance with The Bloodline over the last few weeks, played Roman Reigns' theme music. Following the match, Riddle brawled with The Usos and Zayn. The following week, Riddle defeated Zayn to earn a match against Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship; had Riddle lost, he would have been banished from SmackDown. During the June 13 episode of \"Raw\", Paul Heyman added a stipulation to the match, stating that if Riddle lost, he would not get another title match as long as Reigns was the champion. The match took place on that week's episode of \"SmackDown\", where Reigns retained.\nMadcap Moss was interviewed about his match against Happy Corbin, who then attacked him with a chair, put the chair around Moss' neck, and slammed Moss' André the Giant Memorial Trophy down on top of the chair on him. The next day on \"Talking Smack\", it was reported that Moss suffered a (kayfabe) cervical contusion. On the May 27 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was revealed that Moss would return the following week. There, he lost to Corbin via disqualification after using a steel chair. Later that night, a No Holds Barred match between the two was scheduled for Hell in a Cell.\nCharlotte Flair made her first appearance since WrestleMania Backlash on the December 30 episode of \"SmackDown\", where she challenged and defeated Ronda Rousey in an impromptu match to reclaim the SmackDown Women's Championship for a record-setting seventh time."

Alaska Anchorage had one of the worst offensive performances in the history of NCAA hockey, scoring just 40 goals in 34 games, and were shut out 11 times during the season. Throughout the season, the team struggled to even get chances on goal, averaging just over 22 shots per game while surrendering nearly 32 attempts on their own goal. Perhaps making the situation worse, Alaska Anchorage squandered many good performances by their goaltenders, who gave the team numerous chances to win, including two 0–0 finishes.\nDespite producing the worst season in program history, Alaska Anchorage retained Curley as their head coach.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios in the final, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 7–6(7–3) to win the gentlemen's singles tennis title at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships. It was his seventh Wimbledon title and 21st major singles title overall. Djokovic became the fifth man in the Open Era to record a streak of at least four consecutive titles at one major. By reaching his 32nd men's singles major final, he surpassed Roger Federer's all-time record. Djokovic also became the first player (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four majors with his first-round win over Kwon Soon-woo. Because no ranking points were awarded for the tournament in response to its banning of Russian and Belarusian players, Djokovic dropped out of the top five in ATP rankings after winning the tournament.\nKyrgios became the first unseeded man to reach a major final since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the 2008 Australian Open, the first Australian man to reach a major final since Lleyton Hewitt at the 2005 Australian Open, and the first Australian man and unseeded player to reach the Wimbledon final since Mark Philippoussis in 2003.\nRafael Nadal was attempting to complete the third component of a prospective Grand Slam, but withdrew before his semifinal match against Kyrgios due to a torn abdominal muscle. It was the first time a man had withdrawn from a Wimbledon semifinal or final since Frank Shields in 1931. Cameron Norrie became the fourth British man in the Open Era (after Roger Taylor, Tim Henman, and Andy Murray) to reach the semifinals. It was the first time two left-handed men (Norrie and Nadal) had reached the semifinals since John McEnroe and Goran Ivanišević in 1992, and to the semifinals of any major since Nadal and Jürgen Melzer at the 2010 French Open.\nThis was the first edition of Wimbledon to feature a champions tie-break (10-point tie-break), when the score reaches six games all in the fifth set, and the third edition to feature a final set tie-break. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the first round in the first main-draw 10-point tie-break at Wimbledon. It was also the first Wimbledon since the introduction of the ATP rankings in 1973, and the first major since the 1999 Australian Open, where both the reigning world No. 1 and No. 2 (Daniil Medvedev and Alexander Zverev, respectively) did not compete. Medvedev was prohibited from playing due to his Russian nationality, while Zverev had an ankle injury. This marked the first edition of Wimbledon since 1998 not to feature record eight-time champion Roger Federer, resulting in his dropping out of the ATP rankings for the first time since 1998 (Federer would retire from professional tennis later that year). Feliciano López made his 81st main-draw major appearance, tying Federer's all-time record. John Isner broke Ivo Karlović's world record of 13,728 career aces on the ATP Tour in his third-round match against Jannik Sinner. Stan Wawrinka was attempting to complete the career grand slam, but lost to Sinner in the first round.\nSeeds.\nAll seeds per ATP rankings.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on ATP rankings as of 20 June 2022. Rankings and points are as before 27 June 2022.\nAs a result of special ranking adjustment rules due to the COVID-19 pandemic, players are defending the higher of (i) their points from the 2021 tournament or (ii) the remaining 50% of their points from the 2019 tournament. Those points were not mandatory and are included in the table below only if they counted towards the player's ranking as of 27 June 2022. Note that this is a different rankings adjustment system than the one that the WTA is using for the women's tournament.\nThe ATP is removing ranking points from the 2022 tournament as a result of the All England Club's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the tournament. Points dropping from the 2021 or 2019 tournaments will accordingly be replaced by the player's next best result, regardless of his performance at Wimbledon in 2022.\n† This column shows the higher of the player's points from the 2021 tournament or 50% of his points from the 2019 tournament. Only ranking points counting towards the player's ranking as of 27 June 2022 are reflected in the column.&lt;br&gt;\n‡ Because the ATP is removing ranking points from the 2022 tournament, 2021 or 2019 points will be replaced by the player's next best result instead.&lt;br&gt;\n§ The player had no points from either the 2021 or 2019 tournaments counting towards his ranking on 27 June 2022. Accordingly, no points will be replaced.\nWithdrawn players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but withdrew before the tournament began.\nBanned players.\nThe following players would have been seeded, but were not permitted to enter the tournament due to the decision to ban players from Russia and Belarus.\nOther entry information.\nWild cards.\nSource:\nWithdrawals.\n The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club declined entries from Russian and Belarusian players to 2022 Wimbledon Championships, stating that \"in the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with The Championships\".\nThe entry list was released based on the ATP rankings for the week of 16 May 2022."

He claimed the world No. 1 singles ranking with the win; Ruud, Rafael Nadal, Daniil Medvedev, and Stefanos Tsitsipas were also in contention for the top position. Alcaraz saved a match point en route to the title, in the quarterfinals against Jannik Sinner. Alcaraz became the youngest major champion since Nadal at the 2005 French Open, the youngest US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990, the first man born in the 2000s to win a major singles title, and the youngest man to be ranked world No. 1, surpassing Lleyton Hewitt's record. Alcaraz also became the third player to reach a major final having won three consecutive five-set matches, after Stefan Edberg at the 1992 US Open and Andre Agassi at the 2005 US Open. At 23 hours and 39 minutes of play duration across his seven matches, Alcaraz spent the longest time on court in major history until then, a record that was later broken by Daniil Medvedev at the 2024 Australian Open. Ruud became the first Norwegian to reach the final.\nDaniil Medvedev was the defending champion, but lost in the fourth round to Nick Kyrgios. Medvedev became the first man outside the Big Four to be the top seed at a major since Andy Roddick at the 2004 Australian Open.\nThis marked the third consecutive US Open where a player claimed his first major title. The quarterfinal line-up guaranteed a first-time major champion, while the semifinal line-up marked the first time all four players made their US Open semifinal debut since the inaugural edition in 1881. \nFrances Tiafoe became the first American man to reach the semifinals since Roddick in 2006, and the semifinals of any major since John Isner at the 2018 Wimbledon Championships. Tiafoe also became the first African American man to reach the semifinals since Arthur Ashe in 1972 and the first to reach any major semifinal since MaliVai Washington in 1996. Sinner became the youngest man to reach the quarterfinals at all four majors since Novak Djokovic in 2008. \nNadal was vying for a record-extending 23rd major singles title, but lost in the fourth round to Tiafoe. That marked the first US Open since 2000 and the first major since the 2017 Australian Open with neither of the top two seeded men reaching the quarterfinals. Three-time champion and nine-time finalist Djokovic withdrew prior to the tournament as he could not travel to the United States, due to not having complied with the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens against COVID-19.\nThis was the first edition of US Open to feature a 10-point tie-break, when the score reaches six games all in the deciding set. Pedro Cachin defeated Aljaž Bedene in the first round in the first main-draw 10-point tie-break at the US Open.\nSeeded players.\nThe following are the seeded players. Seedings are based on ATP rankings as of August 22, 2022. Rankings and points before are as of August 29, 2022.\nPoints for the 2021 tournament were not mandatory and are included in the table below only if they counted toward the player's ranking as of August 29, 2022. Players who are not defending points from the 2021 tournament will instead have their 19th best result replaced by their points from the 2022 tournament.\n† This column shows either the player's points from the 2021 tournament or his 19th best result (shown in brackets).

        "text": "The 2022–23 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier was a cricket tournament that formed part of the qualification process for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. In May 2022, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed all the fixtures and venues for the three sub-regional Qualifiers.\nThe sub-regional phase of European qualification for the previous T20 World Cup was eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, only four teams had the opportunity to qualify from a regional finals event. Jersey and Germany progressed from that event and thereby gained a bye through the sub-regional stage in the process for the 2024 T20 World Cup.\nIn this cycle, twenty-eight countries from the European region competed in the sub-regional phase of the tournament, divided into three events being played in June and July 2022. Qualifier C was the first event played, which took place in Belgium between 28 June and 4 July 2022. Qualifiers A and B followed, with both of them hosted in Finland between 12 and 31 July 2022.\nThe winner of each sub-regional qualifier progressed to the regional final. Denmark became the first team to advance to the regional final, after they beat Portugal by nine wickets in the final of sub-regional Qualifier C. Italy were the second team to progress to the regional final, when they beat the Isle of Man by seven wickets in the final of sub-regional Qualifier A. Austria were the last team to qualify from the sub-regional matches, after beating Norway in the final of the sub-regional Qualifier B.\nScotland and Ireland enter the regional final as they had failed to qualify directly for the 2024 T20 World Cup. The regional final was played in Edinburgh, Scotland in July 2023. On 27 July 2023, Ireland secured qualification for the T20 World Cup when their fifth game at the regional final was abandoned due to rain. Later the same day, Scotland also qualified after a fifth consecutive victory. Scotland defeated Ireland by 8 runs in the last game to win the tournament.\nQualifier C.\nSquads.\nOn 22 June 2022, Saud Munir replaced Amjad Khan in the Denmark squad due to work commitments.\nConsolation play-offs.\nFollowing a car accident on 1 July 2022 that involved three match officials, the ICC rescheduled the consolation play-off matches.\nRegional Final.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named ahead of the tournament:\nGareth Delany was ruled out of Ireland's squad due to a broken wrist, and he was replaced by Theo van Woerkom. Chris Sole was ruled out of Scotland's squad due to injury, and he was replaced by Adrian Neill. Denmark's captain Hamid Shah missed the team's first four matches, and Taranjit Bharaj took over as captain while Shah was absent; Shah returned for the remaining games. After the tournament began, Vijayshankar Chikkannaiah was replaced in Germany's squad by Talha Khan due to injury. Ahead of Germany's last two matches of the tournament, Abdul Shakoor was replaced by Matt Montgomery after sustaining an injury. Patrick Gouge was added to Jersey's squad ahead of their last game of the tournament, in place of Benjamin Ward, who was struck by a ball in the previous game."

        "text": "The 2022 ASUN men's basketball tournament was the conference postseason tournament for the ASUN Conference. The tournament was the 43rd year the league has conducted a postseason tournament. The tournament was held March 1, 3, 5, and 8, 2022 at campus sites of the higher seeds. The winner, Bellarmine, did not receive the conference's automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament due to not being eligible because of a transition from Division II. Instead the regular season conference champion, Jacksonville State, was awarded the conference's automatic bid.\nSeeds.\nAll teams in the conference qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded by their record in conference play, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. The top two teams from each division received byes into the quarterfinals. Kennesaw State got a higher seed than North Florida through the NET ranking tiebreaker.\nThe two tiebreakers used by the ASUN are: 1) head-to-head record of teams with identical record and 2) NCAA NET Rankings available on day following the conclusion of ASUN regular season play. These tiebreakers are also used to separate teams with the same seed from opposite divisions if necessary. This proved relevant when both #2 seeds, Bellarmine and Jacksonville, advanced to the championship game. With both having identical conference records, the tiebreaker was applied, and Bellarmine received home court by virtue of its win over Jacksonville in the teams' only regular-season game.\nBracket.\nBecause Bellarmine won the ASUN Tournament, the conference's top overall seed, Jacksonville State, claimed the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. The same would have applied if North Alabama had won the tournament, but the Lions were eliminated in the first round.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

Peter Sharp joined as defence coach in August 2008. Current player Paul Steinmetz was appointed backs coach. Former Ulster players Jonny Bell and Niall Malone joined the academy as Elite Player Development Officers.\nNew signings included Humphreys' younger brother Ian, who had been playing for Leicester Tigers since 2005. Fijian winger Timoci Nagusa joined from Tailevu Knights.\nUlster finished third in their Heineken Cup pool, and eighth in the Celtic League. One highlight of an otherwise disappointing season was a win over Munster at Thomond Park in January, the first time Munster had lost at home in European competition. Three of Ulster's five tries came from Ian Humphreys' assists. Ulster qualified for next season's Heineken Cup as one of Ireland's top three teams, finishing ahead of Connacht in the league. Matt Williams left by mutual consent at the end of the season. Assistant coach Steve Williams also left after his contract was not renewed. For the following season, Ulster put a new management structure in place. Michael Reid was chief executive; David Humphreys was director of rugby, with overall responsibility for the senior team, the Ulster 'A' team (renamed the Ulster Ravens), the Ulster under-20s and the academy; and Brian McLaughlin was appointed head coach, assisted by forwards coaches Jeremy Davidson and Peter Sharp, and backs coach Neil Doak.\nRory Best was Ulster's Player of the Year, and flanker Stephen Ferris was selected for the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa.\nUlster Rugby Awards.\nThe Ulster Rugby Awards ceremony was held on 14 May 2009 at the Ramada Hotel, Belfast.

        "text": "The 2022 Overwatch League season was the fifth season of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional esports league. Contrasted to the first four seasons, which was played on the video game \"Overwatch\", the season was played on an early build of \"Overwatch 2\". The regular season began on May 5, 2022, and ended on October 22. The playoffs were played at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, beginning on October 30, and concluded with the Grand Finals on November 4. The Dallas Fuel won the Grand Finals over the San Francisco Shock to win their first OWL championship.\nLeague format and changes.\nRosters and salaries.\nThe 2022 season was being played on an early build of Blizzard upcoming title \"Overwatch 2\". As such, matches were played with teams of five, rather than teams of six. The minimum number of players on a team was decreased from seven to six, while the maximum number of players remains at twelve. Teams could players to a minimum of one season and could add an option to extend that contract for an additional year, if they so chose. Teams were also allowed to sign players to short-term 30-day contracts and two-way contracts. Additionally, the league's minimum salary was increased from to $50,700.\nRegions and live events.\nAs with the prior two seasons, the twenty teams were divided into two regions, the East and West. Seven teams from China and South Korea competed in the East Region, while thirteen teams from North America and Europe competed in the West Division. While the majority of matches in the 2020 and 2021 seasons were played online, live events returned for the 2022 season.\nBroadcasting.\nThe League hired Toronto-based production provider Dome Productions to produce and broadcast the 2022 season. The decision to hire a third-party operator left \"World of Warcraft\" as Activision Blizzard's only supported esports title that had not been outsourced by March 2022.\nIn January 2022, shoutcasters Brennon \"Bren\" Hook and Josh \"Sideshow\" Wilkinson, who had been with the broadcast team since the league's inaugural season, announced that they did \"not have an agreement for 2022 with Overwatch League, marking the end of [their] four years as broadcast talent.\" In an interview with \"Dot Esports\", the duo noted that the time limit in which negotiations had to take place, as well as the monetary value of the deals, were the main reason for their departure. However, they clarified that they would still be involved with the league via co-streams. The league announced their talent lineup on April 11, 2022, which included neither Hook nor Wilkinson.\nOn April 20, 2022, the OWL announced that they would be launching a co-streaming initiative, in which select streamers would be able to stream OWL broadcasts simultaneously with their own. It will be the first time that the league has allowed co-streaming, and co-streams are restricted to only be broadcast on YouTube.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season began on May 5, 2022. Teams played a total 24 regular season matches, which acted as qualifiers for four standalone tournaments, the Kickoff Clash, Midseason Madness, Summer Showdown and Countdown Cup, which took take place in that order. Each tournament was preceded by six regional qualifying matches. In 2021, all four tournament cycles culminated in an interregional tournament; however, for the 2022 season, the Kickoff Clash and Summer Showdown were regional tournaments, with eight teams qualifying from the West and four teams qualifying in the East, while the Midseason Madness were interregional. The final tournament cycle of the season, the Countdown Cup, did conclude with a tournament.\nSimilar to the 2021 season, the league used a point system, called League Points, to determine regular season standings. Every win in the regular season earned a team one point. Any team that qualifies for a regional tournament received an additional one point; a first- or second-place finish in a regional midseason tournament instead earned the placing team an additional three or two points, respectively. Any team that qualified for the Midseason Madness tournament received an additional one point; a first-, second-, or third- place finish in the Midseason Madness tournament instead earned the placing team an additional four, three, or two points, respectively.\nKickoff Clash.\nThe Kickoff Clash is the first of four midseason tournament cycles of the season. Qualifiers began on May 5 in the West region, while the East region qualifiers were delayed until May 20 due to increasing COVID-19 concerns in China. Teams that advance past the qualifiers will play in their respective regional tournaments, which will take place from June 2 to 5. The West region tournament will take place live at Esports Stadium Arlington.\nMidseason Madness.\nThe Midseason Madness is the second of four midseason tournament cycles of the season. Qualifiers began on June 16 in the West region and June 24 in the East region. Qualification for the Midseason Madness was based on league points earned through the entire first half the season. Teams that advanced past the qualifiers played in an interregional tournament. Like in the previous season, the top Western teams travelled to Hawaii for the interregional tournament to minimize latency, while the top Eastern teams stayed in their home facilities. The 12-team, double-elimination tournament began on July 18 and concluded with the finals on July 23.\nSummer Showdown.\nThe Summer Showdown was the third midseason tournament cycle of the season.\nPostseason.\nPlay-in tournaments.\nThe play-in tournaments were two regional tournaments that took place following the Countdown Cup tournament cycle. The Eastern region play-in tournament saw seeds four through six play in a single-elimination tournament on October 15, with the winner advancing to the season playoffs. In the Western region, seeds seven through ten played in a double-elimination tournament from October 21 to 22, with the top two teams advancing to the season playoffs. All matches were determined by which team wins three maps.\nPlayoffs.\nA total of twelve teams advanced to the season playoffs. The top six teams from the West and the top three teams from the East, based on the regular season standings, advanced directly to the season playoffs. The play-ins qualified an additional one team from the East and two teams from the West. The entirety of the season playoffs took place at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, beginning on October 31, and concluded with the Grand Finals on November 4.\nAwards.\nRole Stars.\nSource:\nPrize pool.\nTeams in the 2022 season competed for a prize pool across midseason tournaments and playoffs, with the payout division detailed below. The Midseason Madness and season playoffs had a prize pool of over ."

The swampy land was quickly transformed into a cricket ground with a sizeable pavilion, with the ground being formally opened on 30 April 1928 by the Governor of British Guiana Cecil Hunter-Rodwell The ground was due to host its inaugural first-class match in the 1996–97 Red Stripe Cup between Guyana and Jamaica, but the match was abandoned. Therefore, the inaugural first-class match played there was between Guyana and a touring England XI in February 1998; since that match, a further four first-class matches were played at the ground, three of which hosted the touring South Africans, Indians and Australians. In addition to hosting first-class matches, the ground also hosted nine List A one-day matches between 1998 and 2011, mostly in the capacity of a neutral venue in the West Indian domestic one-day tournament. During the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the ground was one of two practice venues in Guyana. The ground was one of the venues for the 2022 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, hosting two matches."

The U-League system also includes five other sports.\nThe Korea University Basketball Federation has existed since 1964 and college teams competed in the Korean Basketball Association-sanctioned National Basketball Festival (Korean: 농구대잔치). At that time, basketball was still an amateur sport and teams were all sponsored by corporate companies or universities. When the professional league (Korean Basketball League) was founded in 1997, the senior teams all became professional teams, leaving only the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps's and college teams to compete in the tournament. With the founding of the U-League, a large number of college teams opt not to send their teams to the National Basketball Festival or only send their freshmen."

        "title": "2016–17 Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2016–17 Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 49th season of play for the program and the 11th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Falcons represented the United States Air Force Academy and were coached by Frank Serratore, in his 20th season.\nSeason.\nAir Force began the season as one of the four teams selected to participate in the Ice Breaker Tournament. In a surprising turn of events, the Falcons upset pre-season #5 Boston College behind the standout performance by Shane Starrett. The sophomore netminder faced an onslaught in the championship and turned aside 46 shots to earn a tie. A single-elimination shootout was used to determine the champion and, after Starrett stopped Ohio State's Nick Schilkey, Tyler Ledford scored to secure the title for Air Force. The stunning result contributed to Air Force earning a top-20 ranking the following week, but their position in the polls was short lived as they split the following weekend with Arizona State. The Falcons went through a rough patch in the first half of the year, losing nearly as many games as they won.\nThe Falcons returned after the winter break with a much more concerted defensive effort and ran a winning streak to 6 games. After dropping a weekend to Canisius in mid-January, Air Force won 9 of their next 11 games. The extended period of success allowed the Falcons to regain a spot in the polls and gave them a chance at winning the Atlantic Hockey title. Entering the final weekend of the regular season, they needed four points to get past Canisius or three to split the regular season title. The Falcons blew out Canisius 5–0 in the first game, leaving them one point behind the Griffins. While they were hoping for a repeat performance in the season finale, the Pioneer netminder, Nathan Perry, stopped 39 Falcon shots. That still left Air Force in the lead by a 2–1 score with about a minute to play. After pulling their goaltender, SHU managed to tie the game with 53 seconds left. In the overtime, Air Force was given a gift when Sacred Heart took a penalty at the 50 second mark. The Falcons were unable to get on track during the power play and failed to record a shot on goal. Instead, the Pioneers were able to get Starrett to take an unsportsmanlike penalty and even the playing field. Just 4 seconds after the ensuing faceoff, the puck found its way into the Air Force net and the Falcons were relegated to 2nd-place.\nConference tournament.\nAir Force still earned a bye into their conference quarterfinal round, but they were still on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament. While it was possible that they could make the bracket without a conference championship, it was unlikely even with their outstanding record. The team could ill afford a bad loss now and they took care of business against Bentley. While they had to overcome a 5-minute penalty in the second game, Air Force surrendered just a single goal in the two games and advanced to the semifinal.\nThey got a tough fight from Army and the two rivals were evenly-matched for most of the contest, but Starrett recorded his second shutout of the tournament and the Falcons moved on to the championship. The team played one of its worst games all-season, recording just 14 shots on goal, but still managed to find the twine on two occasions. The Falcons rode a brilliant performance by Starrett to a championship and earned a trip to the national tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nNormally, the Atlantic Hockey champion received a 4th seed for the NCAA tournament. Air Force, with its 26 wins and top-15 ranking, was afforded a 3rd seed, becoming just the second entry from its conference to be given that high of a ranking. They opened the tournament against Western Michigan, who they had already played during the season, and took over the game for the first 44 minutes. The Falcons outshout the Broncos 25–13 entering the third and had a 3–1 lead. Phil Boje netted a power play marker just before the 4-minute mark and it appeared that the Falcons were going to fly to an easy victory. Western Michigan, however, fought back hard and scored twice in the next 75 seconds to cut the lead to 1. Tyler Ledford gave the team a 2-goal cushion less than 90 seconds later but WMU continued to attack. After pulling their goalie, Western Michigan made the score 5–4 with just under 2 minutes to play and all the momentum in their favor. The pressure was eased, however, when Wade Allison took a major penalty at 18:47. Air Force was able to hold off the Broncos and advance to the regional final.\nFor the Falcons' second game, the script was flipped and the team found itself down by 3 goals at the midway point of the game. However, just over a minute after Harvard's third goal, Michael Floodstrand tripped a Falcon. Air Force got possession of the puck on the delayed penalty and managed to finally solve Merrick Madsen. Because NCAA rules did not wipe out a penalty if a team scored prior to the ensuing whistle, Air Force still got a power play out of the infraction and scored 15 seconds into their advantage. This left the team down by just a single goal with over 28 minutes to play. Unfortunately, Harvard's defense closed ranks and the team played nearly error-free hockey for the rest of the game. The Falcons were able to get several shots on goal, but could get no more to find the back of the net and the team was eliminated.\nAfter the season, Shane Starrett was able to parlay his stellar campaign into a professional contract. He became the first Air Force player to sign with an NHL team when he inked a two-year deal with the Edmonton Oilers.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Hong Kong bid for the 2006 Asian Games",
        "text": "The Hong Kong bid for the 2006 Asian Games was an unsuccessful bid, first recognised by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) on 30 June 2000.\nHistory.\nThe Hong Kong Government decided to support the expression of interest by the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF &amp; OC) for hosting the 2006 Asian Games by the end of 1999. The Government supported its decision on the grounds that hosting the 2006 Games help foster a sense of unity, social cohesion and national pride, while representing an extremely attractive opportunity for marketing Hong Kong overseas. In February 2000, the SF &amp; OC submitted a letter of intent for hosting the 2006 Games to the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). On 3 March 2000, the Asian Games Bid Committee was established, chaired by then-Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan. The Hong Kong Sports Association for the Physically Disabled also made a presentation to bid for hosting the 2006 FESPIC Games. On 12 May 2000, the Finance Committee of the Legislative Council accepted in principle the operating cost of HK$1,925 million and the operating deficit of $945 million for hosting the 2006 Asian Games and FESPIC Games.\nBidding Process.\nThe Asian Games Bid Committee engaged in publicity work domestically and abroad. The Committee adopted the slogan \"Hong Kong for Sure!\" () and designed a mascot for promotion. The Bid Committee also lobbied members of the Olympic Council of Asia, first at the annual meeting of the NOC Association in Rio de Janeiro in May 2000. Hong Kong subsequently submitted its formal bid by the deadline on 30 June 2000. The evaluation committee of the OCA, headed by the then vice-president of the association Muhammad Latif Butt, inspected Hong Kong on 19 and 20 July 2000. During the 2000 Summer Olympics, then-Chief Secretary for Administration Anson Chan met in Sydney the President of the OCA and delegates of key countries in the bidding process.\nOn November 12, 2000, voting for the 2006 venue took place during the 19th Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) General Assembly held in Busan, South Korea to choose a host city from four candidate cities: Doha, Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and New Delhi. The voting involved the 41 members of the Olympic Council of Asia and consisted of three rounds, each round eliminating one of the bidding cities. Doha emerged victorious in the second round after winning 22 votes – more than half of the available votes, which according to the regulations of the OCA, cancelled the need for a third one. On the other hand, Hong Kong ranked third with only 6 votes.\nVenues.\nThirty-one sports events were proposed by the SF &amp; OC for the 2006 Asian Games, including mandatory ones on athletics and swimming. Apart from the Ma On Shan Sports Centre due for completion in 2003, all venues are existing facilities, the majority of which are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. In its bid, the Asian Games Bid Committee has indicated the possibility of holding the Opening Ceremony at the Sha Tin Racecourse, Happy Valley Racecourse or a newly built stadium at Kai Tak or West Kowloon to house a desirable capacity of 70,000 spectators."

He played college basketball for the Bryant Bulldogs of the Northeast Conference (NEC). He previously played for the Quinnipiac Bobcats and the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. In Kiss' redshirt senior season at Bryant University, he averaged 25.2 points per game leading the NCAA Division I in scoring.\nHigh school career.\nKiss started his high school career at Loyola School Manhattan then Monsignor Scanlan High School in The Bronx, New York, and began playing basketball seriously in his sophomore season. He then attended Victory Rock Prep School in Sarasota, Florida before spending his senior year at Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Kiss committed to playing college basketball for Quinnipiac in October 2015.\nCollege career.\nQuinnipiac.\nKiss spent one year at Quinnipiac. In his one-season, Kiss became a leader on the team averaging 13.3 points per game. He was named to the MAAC All-Rookie Team including being named the MAAC Rookie of the Week four times and leading Quinnipiac in scoring in eight games. Kiss transferred to Rutgers over the likes of Seton Hall and Auburn.\nRutgers.\nIn his first year with Rutgers, Kiss redshirted due to not being eligible because of NCAA transfer rules. In his first season playing with Rutgers, Kiss would play in 30 games averaging six points a game. Despite this, there were concerns regarding Kiss' defense. The following season, Kiss would only play in two games and as a result Kiss made the decision to transfer to Bryant.\nBryant.\nIn Kiss' first year at Bryant, he played in and started in 22 games averaging 16.6 points per game. As a result, Kiss was named to the First-team All-NEC. In Kiss' second season with Bryant, he led the NCAA in scoring. Kiss averaged 25.1 points per game. Kiss became the fastest player in program history to tally 1,000 points, doing so in 48 games. During the season, Kiss was suspended for the first two games by Bryant head coach Jared Grasso for an unspecified violation of team rules. Kiss was suspended for a second time for unsportsmanlike conduct in a game against Long Island. The suspension kept Kiss out for another two games. Throughout the season, Kiss led the NCAA in technical fouls with 9.\nDespite being one of the top scorers in Division I basketball, Kiss did not win the NEC Player of the Year Award, and it was believed that Kiss's antics kept him from winning the award. He was named to the First Team All-NEC, however. An assistant coach in the NEC called Kiss \"bush league\" and recalled how he mocked opposing players after turnovers and blew a kiss at Fairleigh Dickinson head coach Greg Herenda after hitting a 3-pointer, among other incidents.\nIn the 2022 NEC tournament, Kiss led the Bulldogs to the championship game after wins against Central Connecticut and Mount St. Mary's. Throughout the game, Kiss regularly taunted opposing players and fans by showboating, flexing and doing push-ups after field goals, even screaming \"That's for you, bitch!\" at a reporter who predicted Bryant would lose. After a brawl and a 30-minute delay, play resumed, and the Bulldogs won 70–43 to clinch their first ever bid to the NCAA tournament. Kiss was named the MVP of the tournament.\nIn the 2022 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, Kiss scored 28 points in the Bulldog's First Four game against Wright State. Bryant lost the game 82–93.\nProfessional career.\nIn September 2022, Kiss signed with Mexican team Soles de Mexicali. He scored 11 points in his professional debut, an 89–75 loss to the Dorados de Chihuahua.\nIn October 2023, he signed one year deal with the Bulgarian top flight team Yambol\nPersonal life.\nKiss' parents, Peter and Ida, emigrated from Hungary and Romania. Growing up in Manhattan, Kiss mainly played baseball."

        "text": "Gravel cycling, gravel biking or gravel grinding is a sport, or a leisure activity, in which participants ride bicycles mostly on gravel roads. Sometimes, specially designed gravel bikes are used; in other cases, any bicycle capable of covering the terrain can be used.\nGravel cycling bridges the gap between road and mountain biking, combining the higher speed and efficiency of road cycling with the capability and freedom to ride on rough and loose terrain. While a small number of road races embrace long stretches of unpaved and gravel roads, notable the prestigious Italian classic Strade Bianche, gravel racing as a discipline has its own global series and world championship thanks to Ms Lazzaro as main promoter.\nGravel racing.\nThe distinguishing features of gravel races, also called gravel grinders, include long distances, often , mostly on gravel roads, and mass starts that include all categories of racers, similar to Gran Fondo rides.\nThe bicycles and courses in gravel racing vary widely, from road bicycles with wide tires used on smooth gravel roads to bicycles that are similar to mountain bikes used on courses that include technical trails.\nHistory of gravel racing.\nEnd of 19th century - beginning of 20th century.\nIn the early days of road bike racing, most roads were not paved, so most races were held primarily on unpaved/dirt/gravel roads.\nDue to road infrastructure improving with time, road bike racing shifted almost entirely to paved roads. In America the use of paved roads was largely influenced by a group of cyclists called League of American Wheelmen, who advocated for improving road conditions. Racing bikes got narrow tires and were no longer fit for off-road usage.\n20th century.\nNext to road bike racing, separate off-road cycling disciplines emerged. In autumn and winter in a few European countries, cyclo-cross is a popular professional sport. Cyclo-crossers ride off-road (on grass, sand, mud...) on a variant of a road bicycle, on a closed circuit during a relatively short time (1 hour), and jump or carry their bikes over obstacles or on steep climbs.\nIn the 1970s mountainbiking emerged.\n21st century.\nIn the 21st century, riding and racing road bikes on gravel roads has gained popularity. Gravel cycling, as a mixture of road cycling, cyclo-cross and mountain biking became a new discipline of bicycle racing.\nUnited States.\nThe revival started in the Mid-West of the USA, where gravel cycling evolved from cyclists riding long stretches of gravel and fire roads.\nSome precursors to gravel racing in its current form include road races like the Tour of the Battenkill and Boulder–Roubaix (named after Paris–Roubaix) which are road races with gravel sections.\nOne of the premiere gravel races, Unbound Gravel in Emporia, Kansas (formerly called Dirty Kanza), started in 2006 and is long.\nThis race is a good example of how much gravel biking has grown in recent years: in 2006 there was a total of 34 riders that participated in the race. In June 2019, 2,750 riders lucky enough to be picked from a lottery crossed the start line of the Dirty Kanza 200 and organizers had to introduce other mileage categories.\nWorld.\nStarting in 2010, the Pirate Cycling League in Lincoln, Nebraska started Gravel Worlds. Their grassroots movement gathered steam and as of 2022 is one of the largest gravel races in the world. In 2021, Gravel Worlds® received their registered trademark officially becoming THE Gravel Worlds. Thousands of riders from around the world race Gravel Worlds every year in Lincoln, Nebraska in late August. Champions of this event receive a world championship jersey, a pirate sword trophy, and the title of World Champion and \"Captain of the Gravel Seas\". \nIn 2021, the UCI announced they will sanction in 2022 both the Gravel World Series with about 18 races in 4 continents, and the UCI Gravel World Championships. This first edition of the Championship will be held in Veneto in October and the Dutch champion, Mathieu van der Poel is amongst the favoris with Peter Sagan, Nicolas Roche and Alex Howes.\nRacing rules and culture.\nWhen taking Unbound Gravel as an example, there are checkpoints spaced about apart for longer races, and riders must carry water and food, as well as fix their own tires and bikes.\nIf riders receive outside support at any location other than official checkpoints it will result in immediate disqualification. Riders may assist other riders by any means and at any time.\nThe culture of gravel biking has been a reason it has grown in popularity. Gravel races rarely call for a team of coaches and bicycle technicians because the courses susceptible to varying weather that is hard to train and prepare for. Gravel riders are generally focused on getting through a course rather than maintaining a pace during races. This give way to camaraderie on the trail and caters to a fun and relaxed atmosphere that is not always present in road and mountain bike races.\nGravel Rankings and World Championship.\nGravel cycling as a whole has no governing body such as the UCI or USADA. Each race has its own rules, ethos, and character. Despite the balkanization of the races, a professional field of racers does exist, with each racer creating their own schedule of event to participate in. An independent organization called Pure Gravel has created a ranking system called the \"Pure Gravel Power Rankings\" in order to score and rank professional gravel racers across the myriad gravel races throughout the year. A king and Queen of gravel are crowned at the end of every calendar year.\nOther major gravel events.\nEurope.\nUK: "

        "text": "The 2018–19 Alaska Nanooks men's ice hockey season was the 70th season of play for the program, the 35th at the Division I level and the 6th in the WCHA conference. The Nanooks represented the University of Alaska Fairbanks and were coached by Erik Largen, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter just one season with Lance West behind the bench, Alaska brought in Erik Largen as the program's 27th head coach. The Nanooks had trouble finding their game early in the season under their new leader and began 0–7–1. While some of the struggles were caused by a difficult schedule (6 games came against ranked opponents), Alaska's offense was paltry in those matches. The team averages less than 2 goals per game and were shut out on three occasions.\nThe team improved in November and saw some modest gains in their scoring production. Freshman goalie, Gustavs Dāvis Grigals, also got a turn in net and helped propel Alaska to four wins over a four-week span. While it looked like the team may be rounding a corner, both Grigals and nominal starter Anton Martinsson struggled as the calendar turned to January and the Nanooks ended up with a 5-game losing streak.\nMartinsson recovered first and helped the team right the ship down the stretch. Alaska showed some grit with wins over Bowling Green and Minnesota State when both were ranked in the top-10. The Nanooks were also able to take three out of four games from Alaska Anchorage to claim their seventh straight Governor's Cup.\nIn the WCHA Tournament, Alaska continued to show improvement when they fought hard against 2nd seed, Northern Michigan.

        "text": "The 1979–80 Iona Gaels men's basketball team represented Iona College during the 1979–80 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Gaels, led by fifth-year head coach Jim Valvano, played their home games at the Hynes Athletic Center. The Gaels won the ECAC Metro Basketball tournament to receive a bid to the 1980 NCAA tournament. As the No. 6 seed in the East region, the Gaels defeated No. 11 seed Holy Cross in the opening round – the first and only NCAA Tournament victory in school history. Iona was narrowly defeated by No. 3 seed Georgetown in the round of 32. As of the 2020–21 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, this is the furthest any Iona men's team has ever advanced in the NCAA Tournament.\nOn February 21, Iona halted No. 2 Louisville’s 18-game winning streak by dominating the Cardinals, 77–60, at Madison Square Garden. It was the last game Louisville would lose during the season en route to winning the 1980 NCAA Championship. It was the 12th straight of what would end up being a 17-game win streak for the Gaels.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| ECAC Metro tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Bangor, Maine minor league baseball history",
        "text": "Minor league baseball teams were based in Bangor, Maine between 1894 and 1913, before resuming minor league play in 1994. Playing under numerous nicknames, Bangor teams played as members of the New England League from 1894 to 1896, Maine State League in 1897, New England League in 1901, Maine State League from 1907–1908 and New Brunswick-Maine League in 1913, winning two league championships while hosting early minor league home games at Maplewood Park.\nMany decades later, Bangor hosted the Bangor Blue Ox (1994–1997) and Bangor Lumberjacks (2003–2004), who played as members of the Independent Northeast League.\nHistory.\nMinor league baseball began in Bangor, Maine with the 1894 Bangor \"Millionaires,\" who became members of the eight–team New England League. In the 1894 season, the Millionaires finished with a 48–48 record and placed fourth in the league final standings. Bangor was managed by Louis Bacon and Jack Sharrott, finishing 13.5 games behind the first place Fall River Indians.\nBangor continued play in the 1895 Class B level New England League, placing third in the league standings. The Millionaires ended the season with a 55–49 record under managers Jack Sharrott and William Long, finishing 11.0 games behind the first place Fall River Indians.\nThe 1896 Bangor Millionaires placed second in the New England League standings. Bangor finished 2.5 games behind the first place Fall River Indians with a 63–39 record in the eight–team league. William Long and Mike McDermott were the managers.\nIn 1897, the Bangor Millionaires switched leagues, joining the independent level Maine State League, which folded during the season. With Jack Sharrott returning as manager, Bangor had 12–19 record and were in third place when the league folded. The six–team 1897 final league standings featured the Augusta Kennebecs (14–8), Bangor Millionaires (12–19), Belfast Pastimes (10–16), Lewiston (15–14), Portland (21–6) and Rockland (10–19).\nReturning to minor league in 1901, Bangor began the season as members of the independent level New England League before relocating during the season. On June 30, 1901, Bangor had a record of 22–14 under manager Walter Burnham when the franchise relocated to Brockton, Massachusetts. The Bangor/Brockton franchise disbanded on July 6, 1901, finishing with a 24–16 overall record.\nBangor was without a minor league team until the 1907 Maine State League reformed as an eight–team Class D league. Bangor began play in the 1907 season alongside fellow members from Augusta, Maine (Augusta Senators), Biddeford, Maine (Biddeford Orphans), Lewiston, Maine (Lewiston), Manchester, New Hampshire (Manchester), Portland, Maine (Pine Tree Capers), a second team in Portland (Portland Blue Sox) and Waterville, Maine (Waterville).\nBangor and the 1907 Maine State League began play on May 24, 1907. The league lost several franchises before the season concluded. Both Manchester and Waterville folded in June, Manchester with a 1–7 record and Waterville with an 8–14 record. The Augusta franchise disbanded on July 29, 1907, with a 27–28 record. Lewiston was 24–24 when that franchise folded on August 3, 1907.\nWith four teams remaining, the Bangor Cubs won the 1907 Maine State League Championship. Bangor had a 47–31 final record, as the league held no playoffs. The Bangor Cubs were followed by the Biddeford Orphans (30–27), Portland Blue Sox (39–41) and Pine Tree Capers (27–32) in the 1907 final standings. The Augusta Senators (27–28), Lewiston (24–23), Manchester (1–7) and Waterville (8–14) all folded before the completion of the season.\nBangor returned to play as the Bangor White Sox in the six–team 1908 Maine State League, winning a second consecutive championship in an unconventional manner. Bangor joined Augusta, Biddeford, and the Portland Blue Sox as the 1908 league members who finished the season, as Pine Tree and York Beach disbanded during the season.\nBangor and the Maine State League began play on June 10, 1908. The Lewiston franchise moved to Augusta after twelve games. Pine Tree (15–13) and York Beach (10–15) both disbanded on July 19, 1908. When the Portland Blue Sox disbanded on August 28, 1908, the Maine State League permanently folded. The Portland Blue Sox were in 1st place with a 32–20 record when disbanding. Portland finished ahead of the Bangor White Sox (31–22), Lewiston/Augusta (20–26) and Biddeford (18–30) in the standings. However, since Portland folded, the Bangor White Sox were awarded the 1908 Maine State League Championship.\nBaseball returned to Bangor when the Bangor Maroons were charter members of the four–team 1913 Class D level New Brunswick-Maine League. Bangor finished with a 18–48, record and in fourth place, playing the season under managers George Magoon, Frank Connaughton and Lamorey. Bangor finished 23.5 games behind the first place Fredericton Pets. The league folded after their only season.\nBangor was without a minor league team for over 80 years, until the Bangor Blue Ox became members of the 1994 independent Northeast League.\nThe ballparks.\nEarly Bangor minor league teams played home games at Maplewood Park. The ballpark was called Maplewood Park as the site was home to the Maplewood Hotel. The site was later called Eastern Maine Fairgrounds and then Bass Park. Harness racing has been hosted at the site throughout its duration. Today, Bass Park continues as the long time home of the Bangor State Fair.\nThe Bangor Blue Ox and Bangor Lumberjacks teams played minor league home games at the Mahaney Diamond on the campus of the University of Maine.\nFor their final season of 2004, the Bangor Lumberjacks hosted home games at the Winkin Complex.\nNotable alumni.\nSee also.\n&lt;br&gt;\nExternal links.\nBangor - Baseball Reference"

        "text": "The 2022 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the men's singles tournament at the 2022 Australian Open, contested by sixth-seed Rafael Nadal and second-seed Daniil Medvedev. It was a match of historic proportions for both players: Nadal was attempting to surpass an all-time joint record of 20 major men's singles titles, shared with his great rivals, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, by winning a record 21st major title; and to become the fourth man to complete the double career Grand Slam (after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic). Medvedev was seeking to become the first man in the Open Era to win his first two major titles at consecutive events (having won the preceding US Open title).\nNadal defeated Medvedev, 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5, in 5 hours and 24 minutes to win his second Australian Open title, and a then all-time record 21st major men's singles title. This was the second-longest major final in history after the 2012 Australian Open final, in which Nadal also participated. Nadal became the first player in the Open Era to win an Australian Open final after losing the first two sets, and the first to do so since Emerson in 1965. Nadal also set the record for the longest span between titles at the same Grand Slam tournament; he last won the tournament in 2009, a gap of 13 years. It also marked the third consecutive year a man trailed by two sets in a major final yet rallied to win, following Dominic Thiem's victory at the 2020 US Open and Djokovic's at the 2021 French Open, and only the seventh such occasion in the Open Era (preceded by five French Open finals and one US Open final).\nBackground.\nNadal and Medvedev had met on four previous occasions, including in the 2019 US Open final where Nadal prevailed in five sets. Heading into the match, Nadal led their head-to-head 3–1. However, Medvedev entered the final with a 13-match win streak at the majors, having won the 2021 US Open final in straight sets against the world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. Medvedev's hardcourt record in the previous 12 months and Nadal's injury-ridden 2021 season, which included a six-month absence from competitive tennis, led to Medvedev being considered the favorite prior to the match.\nMatch.\nThe match began at 7:47 pm local time and ended at 1:11 am the following day.\nMedvedev broke Nadal's serve twice to take the first set 6–2. In the second set, Nadal broke Medvedev's serve at 2–1 in a game featuring a 40 shot rally, and consolidated to take a 4–1 lead. Medvedev broke back at 4–2, but Nadal broke again in the next game to take a 5–3 lead and earn a chance to close the set out on his serve. Medvedev saved a set point with a backhand down the line that drew a Nadal backhand error, and was able to break back when Nadal pushed a forehand long. Both players would then hold their serve to send the set into a tiebreak at 6–6. In the tiebreak, Nadal held a mini-break advantage on two occasions and led 5–3, but could not hold on as Medvedev won four straight points to win the tiebreak 7–5 and take a two-set advantage. The second set lasted 84 minutes and was the longest set of the tournament.\nIn the third set, Nadal faced three break points at 2–3, 0–40. Nadal saved all three break points to hold and then broke Medvedev's serve at 4–4 with a backhand passing shot, a moment that was crucial to shifting the momentum of the match. He successfully held serve at 5–4 to claim the third set. In the fourth set, Nadal broke Medvedev's serve at 2–2 with a drop shot followed by a cross-court backhand passing shot. Nadal would close out the set 6–4 to send the match into a championship-deciding fifth set.\nNadal took a break lead in the fifth set at 2–2 with a running forehand down the line, and served for the championship at 5–4. From 30–0 up in the game, Nadal committed two unforced errors and a double fault to allow Medvedev to break back. However, Nadal broke right back at 5–5 after Medvedev committed a forehand unforced error. He served for the championship a second time at 6–5, and held the game at love to complete a comeback and win his second Australian Open after 13 years, as well as surpassing Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer to win a then-record 21st major men's singles title, winning the match 2–6, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4, 7–5.\nOfficials.\nAustralian John Blom was the chair umpire throughout the match.\nStatistics.\nSource"

        "title": "2021–22 Ulster Rugby season",
        "text": "The 2021–22 season was Ulster Rugby's 28th season since the advent of professionalism in rugby union, and Dan McFarland's fourth season as head coach. They competed in the inaugural United Rugby Championship (successor competition to the Pro14) and the European Rugby Champions Cup.\nThe major new signing was South African number eight Duane Vermeulen. Ulster finished third in the URC, and second in the Irish Shield, qualifying for the playoffs and for next season's Champions Cup. They beat Munster at home in the quarter-final, but went out in the semi-final to the Stormers in Cape Town. Lock Alan O'Connor won the URC Tackle Machine award, and flanker Nick Timoney and centre James Hume were named in the league's Dream Team. Ulster won all four of their pool games in the Champions Cup, finishing second and qualifying for a two-legged round of sixteen playoff against Toulouse, which they lost by an aggregate score of 49-50. Fullback Michael Lowry was nominated for European Player of the Year and made his debut for Ireland. James Hume was Ulster's Player of the Year.\nUlster used 46 players this season, compared to Leinster with 60, Munster with 59 and Connacht with 46. Alan O'Connor, Billy Burns and Nick Timoney made the most appearances for the province, each appearing in 24 out of 26 games. Robert Baloucoune was top try scorer with 11. Nick Timoney was RTÉ's choice for Ulster's player of the season, and Andrew Warwick was their most underrated player. Nathan Doak had a breakthrough season, deputising for the injured John Cooney as scrum-half and goal kicker, and finishing the season the team's leading scorer with 132 points.\nEvents.\nPersonnel changes.\nAssistant coach Dwayne Peel left in the off-season to become head coach of Scarlets. Skills coach Dan Soper was promoted to assistant, and Craig Newby joined as the new skills coach. Gavin Hogg, formerly rugby development officer, became the new academy manager, assisted by Willie Faloon as elite performance development officer.\nAfter the departure of Marcell Coetzee last season, Ulster attempted to sign Fijian forward Leone Nakarawa, but the move fell through following a medical report. As the season began, Ulster announced the signing of South African number 8 Duane Vermeulen, who would join the squad in November after the autumn internationals. Other new arrivals were lock Mick Kearney, signed from Zebre Parma, and hooker Declan Moore, signed from Munster as short-term injury cover.\nJoining the senior squad from the academy on development contracts were wing Aaron Sexton, scrum-half Nathan Doak, hooker Tom Stewart, wing Ethan McIlroy, prop Callum Reid flanker David McCann, lock Cormac Izuchukwu, and wing Ben Moxham.\nFive new players joined the academy: out-half James Humphreys, son of Ulster great David Humphreys, joining from the Gloucester academy; RBAI centre Jude Postlethwaite; and three players from Sullivan Upper School, lock Harry Sheridan, prop George Saunderson and scrum-half Conor McKee.\nDeparting were hooker Adam McBurney to Edinburgh, Matt Faddes to Otago, and out-half Bill Johnston to Ealing Trailfinders, making his loan move last season permanent. Fullback Louis Ludik retired. Scrum-half Alby Mathewson and prop Kyle McCall were released, and academy centre Hayden Hyde moved to Harlequins' academy.\nSponsorship.\nBritish government minister Michael Gove wrote to Ulster in December, urging the team to end their relationship with principal sponsor Kingspan, after the firm was criticised by the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire for supplying some of the insulation materials involved. This led to protests outside Ravenhill before Ulster's Champions Cup game against Clermont in January 2022.\nSummer internationals.\nLock Iain Henderson was selected for the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. He didn't play in any of the tests, but made four appearances, including starting against Japan and captaining the side against the Sharks. \nCentre James Hume, wing Robert Baloucoune and flanker Nick Timoney all made their Ireland debuts in the summer international against the United States in July, and uncapped fullback Michael Lowry trained with the Ireland squad for the summer internationals.\nPre-season.\nUlster played two friendlies, home and away, against Saracens. The home match was played at the Kingspan on 3 September 2021, and Saracens won 45-21. The away match at the Honourable Artillery Company grounds in London on 9 September 2021, and Ulster won 33-3.\nFirst block.\nUlster won their first four matches of the URC season. Hooker Bradley Roberts made his first competitive start, and scored a try in the season opener at home to Glasgow Warriors. Scrum-half John Cooney went off injured in the first half, replaced by 19-year-old Nathan Doak, who scored a try and three conversions. With Cooney missing, Doak started in the away win against Zebre Parma and the home wins against Benetton and Lions, and continued to impress. Hooker Rob Herring made his 200th appearance for Ulster against Benetton. Fullback Will Addison sustained a fracture to his lower leg in the October match against the Lions. Ulster's winning run was halted by a defeat away to Connacht at the Aviva Stadium on 23 October.\nAutumn international break.\nClub competition then took a break for the Autumn internationals. Lock Iain Henderson came on as a replacement for Ireland in the 60-5 win over Japan, and started in the 29-20 victory over New Zealand , with hooker Rob Herring coming off the bench. Henderson and wing Robert Baloucoune started, with prop Tom O'Toole and flanker Nick Timoney coming off the bench, in the 53-7 win against Argentina. Centres James Hume and Stuart McCloskey were named in the 38-man squad, but did not make an appearance. Hooker Bradley Roberts was called up for Wales, and made his international debut from the bench against South Africa.\nSecond block.\nAfter the break, John Cooney returned to action for a 20-10 away win over Leinster, with the back row of Marcus Rea, Nick Timoney and David McCann impressing, but this was followed by a disappointing away loss to Ospreys, in which wing Craig Gilroy made his 200th appearance for Ulster.\nHaving been awarded development contracts at the start of the season, scrum-half Nathan Doak and wing Ethan McIlroy signed long-term senior contracts in December - Doak for four years, McIlroy for three.\nIt was announced that Former head coach Neil Doak would return to Ulster as elite player development officer for the academy in early 2022.\nUlster opened their Champions Cup season on 11 December with an away win against Clermont, which marked Duane Vermeulen's debut for the province. The following weekend they defeated Northampton Saints at home, with fullback Michael Lowry scoring two tries. The next two scheduled URC matches, Interpros at home to Connacht on 26 December and Leinster on 1 January, were postponed because of Covid-19 cases. Ulster's next game was a tight away defeat to Munster, before the Champions Cup resumed with an away win against Northampton Saints, which marked Nathan Doak's first European start, and a home win against Clermont, in which Ulster built up a 22-point lead before Clermont almost pulled it back with three late tries. These four pool victories earned Ulster a two-legged round of 16 tie against reigning champions Toulouse.\nSix Nations international break.\nRobert Baloucoune, James Hume, Michael Lowry, Iain Henderson, Rob Herring, Tom O'Toole and Nick Timoney were called up to the Ireland squad for the 2022 Six Nations Championship on 19 January. Bradley Roberts was called up for Wales.\nA depleted Ulster side, missing most of their internationals, defeated Scarlets at home on 28 January. Wing Craig Gilroy, who received a yellow card for a dangerous tackle during the game, was later cited and banned for four matches. The home tie against Connacht was rescheduled for 4 February, on the eve of Ireland's opening match of the Six Nations against Wales. Robert Baloucoune, Michael Lowry and Nick Timoney, who had not been selected for that game, were temporarily released from the Ireland camp back to Ulster. Baloucoune and Lowry started, Timoney came off the bench, and Baloucoune scored two tries, in a 32-12 victory. Hooker Declan Moore, who had joined Ulster as short-term injury cover from Munster, and had just agreed to a permanent move next season, unexpectedly made his debut after a last-minute injury to John Andrew, and scored a try. The following day, James Hume came off the bench in Ireland's 29-7 victory over Wales.\nFullback Michael Lowry was named on the long list for EPCR European Player of the Year for the 2021-22 season, and made his debut for Ireland against Italy in the Six Nations on 27 February 2022.\nJames McCormick, Reuben Crothers, James McNabney, Josh Hanlon, Adam McNamee, Scott Wilson, Jude Postlethwaite, Lorcan McLoughlin and Ben Carson appeared for Ireland in the 2022 U20 Six Nations.\nIn February, lock David O'Connor joined Ealing Trailfinders until the end of the season, and academy centre Jude Postlethwaite signed a development contract, to be upgraded to a full senior contract after a year. Academy scrum-half Lewis Finlay signed for English Championship club Ampthill.\nThird block.\nHaving beaten Leinster away in November, Ulster completed a rare double by defeating them at home on a rainy night in March. They then travelled to South Africa, losing narrowly to the Stormers in Cape Town after a late try by Callum Reid, which would have put Ulster ahead, was disallowed after TMO review. URC head of officials Tappe Henning later admitted the try should have stood. Alan O'Connor made his 150th appearance for Ulster against the Stormers. The following week, against the Bulls in Pretoria, Andrew Warwick made his 150th appearance as Ulster fell to a 34-16 defeat. The trip to South Africa saw centre Luke Marshall return to action after 16 months out with a knee injury. He came off the bench against the Stormers, and started, and scored, against the Bulls.\nUlster won the away leg of their Champions Cup round of 16 tie against Toulouse 26-20, with Robert Baloucoune scoring a hat-trick after Toulouse wing Juan Cruz Mallia was shown an early red card. Taking a six-point lead into the second leg at home, they lost 30-23, going out of the competition 49-50 on aggregate. Flanker Nick Timoney made his 100th appearance for the province in the second leg.\nFormer Springboks and Ulster flanker Pedrie Wannenburg was killed in a car accident in Texas in April.\nIn the wake of the defeat at home to Toulouse, Ulster suffered their first home loss in the URC, at home to Munster. The following week, they ended their losing run by inflicting a first home league defeat on Edinburgh in a close contest, confirming their qualification for the quarter-finals. Two weeks later, they secured a home quarter-final by defeating the Sharks at home. They defeated Munster in the quarter-final at Ravenhill on 3 June, earning a semi-final away to the Stormers.

Led by head coach Norm Sloan, the team played their home games at the O'Connell Center in Gainesville, Florida. After finishing second in the SEC regular season standings, Florida was bounced in the quarterfinal round of the SEC Tournament by LSU. The Gators received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, the school's (technically) first appearance in the tournament, where they made a run to the Sweet Sixteen. In the opening round, Florida defeated NC State and followed that by knocking off No. 3 seed Purdue. The run ended in the East Regional semifinal, where Florida was beaten by eventual National runner-up Syracuse, 87–81. The team finished with a record of 23–11 (12–6 SEC).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| SEC Tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA Tournament"

The team rebounded with a win over #9 Minnesota State but could then only win two of their next eleven games. The Nanooks' offense was subpar during the first half of the season, scoring more than 3 goals in only four of their twenty games while averaging just over two and half goals per game. While the two goaltenders, Jenks and Jones, kept the team in most games, inconsistent play had led to Jenks supplanting the senior as the primary netminder in the first half of the year.\nAfter a couple of bad outings around new year's, Jones was back in as the starter and didn't relinquish the job for the rest of the year. While the team's offense didn't get any better, the defense got stronger as they year went along and helped the team improve to 6th in the standings by the end of the season.\nEntering the postseason, Alaska was hoping to continue giving Minnesota State fits, having defeated the Mavericks twice during the regular season. Unfortunately, the offense was absent from the series and the Nanooks were only able to record a single goal in two games.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

After two years, however, he left school. In 1979 he returned to the college ranks, this time at Augsburg College. After settling in, he began to play hockey again and was part of the Auggies 1982 Championship team.\nSchwartz graduated with a BA in education in 1983 and embarked on a professional career. In 1986 he returned to ice hockey once more as the head coach for his alma mater, Johnson High School. He helped the team win back-to-back twin cities championships in '89 and '90 and was hired by the Sioux City Musketeers as head coach. Schwartz did not see much success in the USHL and was fired after just one season with the Musketeers finishing last in the league. After working as an NHL scout for a year, Schwartz was back behind the bench, this time for White Bear Lake High School. His second turn in high school just as good as the first and he led the White Bears to three consecutive state tournament appearances.\nIn 1996, Ed Saugestad retired from coaching after 38 years with Augsburg. Schwartz was chosen as his successor and he got off to a good start with a winning season in his first year. For an encore, He led Augsburg to its first conference title in 16 years and the program's first every MIAC Tournament championship (the tournament began in 1986). Despite the NCAA not using automatic qualifiers at the time, the Auggies were also able to make their second NCAA Tournament appearance (the first in 14 years). Augsburg finished 4th in the tournament after taking down Wisconsin–River Falls in the quarterfinals and Schwartz was named as the Division III coach of the year.\nThe team declined sharply the following year, but Schwartz was able to rebuild the Auggies into a contender in the MIAC. After 2003, however, the program sank out of the playoff picture. In spite of the diminishing returns on the ice, Schwartz was named as the school's director of athletic facilities and helped with major extensions and renovations to several structures on campus, including the Si Melby Hall and Edor Nelson Field. He remained as the facilities director even after resigning as head coach in 2006. Two years later, however, Schwartz left Augsburg to pursue a career in the financial sector.\nSchwartz was inducted into the Minnesota Hockey Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2019."

        "text": "Nathan Smith is an American professional ice hockey center currently playing for the Tucson Roadrunners in the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Utah NHL team of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was a member of United States national team at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nPlaying career.\nGrowing up in Florida, Smith initially played roller hockey before switching to ice hockey when he was 10 with the Tampa Scorpions youth program. He was a high-scoring forward in junior hockey, leading the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders for two consecutive years. Despite being taken by the Winnipeg Jets in the 2018 NHL Draft, he remained in juniors for another year before beginning his college career. He debuted for Minnesota State in 2019 and provided second-line scoring for a team that was ranked #1 for a time during the season. Minnesota State entered the postseason as one of the favorites to contend for a national title. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the Mavericks' season to end abruptly.\nAfter the end of his freshman year was canceled, Smith's sophomore season was delayed by over a month. Despite the upheaval, Smith put up good numbers and finished second on the team in scoring. In the Mavericks' first game of the NCAA Tournament, they were down 1–3 with under 10 minutes to play. Smith scored to cut the lead in half, which began a tremendous comeback by MSU that led to the program's first tournament win at the Division I level. After scoring a goal in Minnesota State's 4–0 win over Minnesota, he added two more on the power play against St. Cloud State in the national semifinal. While it wasn't enough to get the Mavericks a win, it did earn him a spot on the All-Tournament Team.\nAt the start of his junior season in 2021–22, Smith began scoring in bunches. By the end of December, he was leading the nation in scoring. He would finish the season, placing second in league-wide scoring having registered 19 goals and 50 points in 38 games with Minnesota State. He helped the Mavericks reach the Frozen Four championship game against the University of Denver and was a Hobey Baker top 10 finalist.\nOn March 21, 2022, Smith's NHL rights were traded by the Jets, along with the contract of Bryan Little, to the Arizona Coyotes in exchange for a 2022 fourth-round draft pick. At the conclusion of his junior season, Smith was immediately signed by the Coyotes to a two-year, entry-level contract on April 11, 2022. One day later on April 12, 2022, Smith made his NHL debut against the New Jersey Devils. He registered his first NHL point setting up a Nick Ritchie goal in a 5–3 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on April 19. He scored his first NHL goal on April 20 against Kevin Lankinen in a 4–3 overtime loss to the Chicago Blackhawks. He finished the season with Arizona playing in ten games, scoring two goals and four points.\nSmith spent the majority of the 2022–23 season with the Coyotes' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners. He was recalled by Arizona in March. He appeared in four games before being sent back to the Roadrunners. In the offseason, Smith signed on a one-year, two-way contract with Arizona on July 8. Smith was assigned to the AHL to begin the 2023–24 season.\nInternational play.\nIn the midst of a standout junior collegiate season, Smith was as a prime target for the United States national team when the NHL announced that it would not be sending its players to Beijing for the Winter Olympics. Less than a month later, Smith was named to the team. In a fifth-place finish with Team USA, Smith contributed 1 goal and 2 points through 4 games."

        "title": "Augusta, Maine minor league baseball history",
        "text": "Minor league baseball teams were based in Augusta, Maine in various seasons between 1895 and 1908. Augusta teams played as members of the New England League from 1895 to 1896, Maine State League in 1897, New England League in 1901 and the Maine State League from 1907 to 1908. \nAugusta hosted home minor league games at the Augusta Driving Park.\nHistory.\nMinor league baseball began in Augusta, Maine with the Augusta Kennebecs, who became members of the 1895 Class B level New England League. Augusta was a late addition to the New England League and was at a disadvantage in signing players. In the 1895 season, the Kennebecs finished with a 44–54 record and were last in the eight–team league final standings. Augusta was managed by Walter Burnham, finishing 24.0 games behind the first place Fall River Indians.\nThe Augusta, Maine use of the \"Kennebecs\" team moniker is regional and corresponds to Augusta's location within Kennebec County, Maine.\nThe 1896 Augusta Kennebecs continued play and finished in sixth place in the New England League. Augusta was 31.0 games behind the Fall River Indians with a 35–68 record playing in the eight–team league, which lost two members during the season. Walter Harrington and Daniel Clare managed the Kennebecs in 1896.\nIn 1897, the Augusta Kennebecs switched leagues and joined the Independent Maine State League, with Billy Long as manager. Augusta had a 14–8 record and was in second place when the team folded on June 26, 1897, with the league folding soon after, on July 6, 1897. The entire six–team 1897 league standings featured the Augusta Kennebecs (14–8), Bangor Millionaires (12–19), Belfast Pastimes (10–16), Lewiston (15–14), Portland (21–6) and Rockland (10–19).\nIn 1901, the Augusta Live Oaks began the season as new members in the independent level New England League. On June 30, 1901, the team was 10–23 under manager John Leighton when the franchise briefly relocated to Lynn, Massachusetts to become the Lynn Live Oaks before folding. The Augusta/Lynn franchise disbanded on July 6, 1901, finishing with a 11–25 overall record.\nThe 1907 Augusta Senators resumed play as members of the Maine State League, which reformed as an eight–team Class D level league. The \"Senators\" moniker was in reference to Augusta being the state capitol of Maine. Augusta began play in the 1907 season alongside fellow members from Bangor, Maine (Bangor Cubs), Biddeford, Maine (Biddeford Orphans), Lewiston, Maine (Lewiston), Manchester, New Hampshire (Manchester), Portland, Maine (Pine Tree Capers), a second team in Portland (Portland Blue Sox) and Waterville, Maine (Waterville).\nAugusta and the 1907 Maine State League began play on May 24, 1907. The league lost several franchises before the season concluded, Augusta included. Both Manchester and Waterville folded in June. The Augusta Senators franchise disbanded on July 29, 1907, with a 27–28 record under manager Paul Wreath. In the final 1907 standings, the Bangor Cubs had a 47–31 final record, followed by the Biddeford Orphans (30–27), Portland Blue Sox (39–41) and Pine Tree Capers (27–32) in the 1907 final standings. The Augusta Senators (27–28), Lewiston (24–23), Manchester (1–7) and Waterville (8–14) teams each folded before the completion of the season.\nThe Maine State League began play on June 10, 1908, without a team in Augusta. With an 8–4 record under manager Mike McDonough, the Lewiston franchise moved to Augusta. Pine Tree (15–13) and York Beach (10–15) both disbanded on July 19, 1908, and when the Portland Blue Sox disbanded on August 28, 1908, the Maine State League permanently folded. The Portland Blue Sox were in 1st place with a 32–20 record, followed the Bangor White Sox (31–22), Lewiston/Augusta (20–26) and Biddeford (18–30) in the standings. However, since Portland folded, the Bangor White Sox were awarded the 1908 Maine State League Championship.\nAugusta, Maine has not hosted another minor league team.\nThe ballpark.\nAugusta minor league teams hosted minor league home games at the Augusta Driving Park. Augusta also played some games in nearby Gardiner, Maine and Waterville, Maine. The Driving Park was adjacent to the south of Capitol Park, which lies in the shadow of the Maine State Capitol."

        "text": "Minor league baseball teams were based in Muskogee, Oklahoma in various seasons between 1905 and 1957. The final team, the Muskogee Giants, played as members of the Western Association (1951–1954) and the Sooner State League (1955–1957). Earlier Muskogee teams played as members of the Missouri Valley League (1905), South Central League (1906), Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas League (1907–1908), Western Association (1909–1911), Oklahoma State League (1912), Western Association (1914, 1916–1917), Southwestern League (1921–1923), Western Association (1924–1932), Western League (1933), Western Association (1934–1942, 1946–1954) and Sooner State League (1955–1957). Muskogee never captured a league championship, making league finals on multiple occasions.\nMuskogee teams played as a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Browns in 1932, New York Giants in 1936, Cincinnati Reds from 1937 to 1939, Chicago Cubs in 1941, Detroit Tigers in 1946, St. Louis Browns from 1947 to 1949 and New York Giants from 1951 to 1957.\nThree Baseball Hall of Fame inductees played for Muskogee. Bill Dickey played for the 1926 Muskogee Athletics. Bobby Wallace played for the 1921 Muskogee Mets, as a player/manager. Rube Marquard managed and pitched for the 1933 Muskogee Oilers.\nHistory.\nProfessional baseball began in Muskogee in 1905, with the Muskogee Reds playing as a member of the Missouri Valley League. The Muskogee Redskins played as members of the Oklahoma-Arkansas-Kansas League (1907), Oklahoma-Kansas League (1908) and the Western Association (1911). In 1910, the Muskogee Navigators, playing in the Western Association, disbanded on July 22, 1910. The Muskogee Indians folded, along with the entire league, when the Oklahoma State League disbanded on June 29, 1912.\nThe Muskogee Mets lost in the league finals in 1914, 1915 and 1922. Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Bobby Wallace was a player/manager for the Muskogee Mets in 1921, hitting .368 in 13 games at age 47.\nThe Muskogee Athletics lost in the 1925 Western Association league finals. Baseball Hall of Fame member Bill Dickey played for the Muskogee Athletics in 1926, hitting .283 with 7 home runs in 61 games at age 19. 1931 World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals Manager Gabby Street managed the Athletics for the 1924 and 1925 seasons. Owned by local drugstore operator Joe Magoto, the Athletics disbanded on July 18, 1926. Magoto later owned the Muskogee Reds.\nThe Muskogee Chiefs moved to Maud, Oklahoma on August 29, 1929, to complete their season as the Maud Chiefs. They returned to Muskogee in 1930. On June 8, 1932, Muskogee moved to Hutchinson, Kansas to become the Hutchinson Wheat Shockers, playing in the Western League. However, the Fort Smith Twins of the Western Association moved to Muskogee on July 1, 1932, to complete their season as the Muskogee Chiefs. The second 1932 Muskogee Chiefs were an affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. Notably, The second 1932 Muskogee Chiefs traded George Hubbell to their old team, the Hutchinson Wheat Shockers, in exchange for four new baseballs.\nThe Davenport Blue Sox replaced Muskogee in the Western Association in 1933. However, the Muskogee Oilers rejoined the Western League when the Wichita Oilers moved to Muskogee on June 6, 1933. Baseball Hall of Fame member Rube Marquard managed and pitched for the 1933 Oilers at age 46.\nThe Muskogee Tigers were minor league affiliates of the New York Giants in 1936.\nThe Muskogee Reds lost in the 1947 Western Association League finals. The Reds were affiliates of the Cincinnati Reds (1937–1939), Chicago Cubs (1941), Detroit Tigers (1946) and St. Louis Browns (1947–1949).\nThe Muskogee Giants were members of the Western Association from 1951 to 1954 and the Sooner State League from 1955 to 1957. The Giants were a minor league affiliate of the New York Giants (1951–1957) and lost in the league finals in 1952 and 1955. Muskogee folded when the Sooner State League permanently folded after the 1957 season.\nThe ballparks.\nThe earliest Muskogee teams played at Benson Park. Named after two of the three principal investors in Muskogee's streetcar system, Benson Park was located near the end of streetcar line that ran down South 21st Street. Early maps show the exact location as a block bounded by Garrett Street (now 22nd Street) on the east, Virginia Avenue (now Maryland Avenue) on the north, and Border Avenue on the south.\nIn 1908, the Muskogee Redskins began to play most of their schedule at Pioneer Park. Sunday games were still held at Benson Park, which was outside city limits and thus not subject to municipal restrictions on Sunday play. Pioneer Park was located at the intersection of Fourth and Court Streets in downtown Muskogee. Although Pioneer Park's central location was considered a plus, the viability of this arrangement was regularly threatened by ongoing disputes between the team and the ballpark owners. Nonetheless, the Muskogee Navigators continued to play games at Pioneer Park through 1909.\nIn 1910, the continuing difficulties with Pioneer Park's ownership prompted the construction of a new ballpark on the east side of Muskogee. This new facility, called Athletic Park (not to be confused with the latter ballpark of the same name in downtown Muskogee), was located immediately to the east of the car barn for the streetcar system, which maps show to be located where North Street crosses the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway line on the way east toward Green Hill Cemetery. The car barn was immediately adjacent to the Hyde Park streetcar line, providing access for fans attending games there. Athletic Park ultimately was limited to hosting Sunday games after a deal was struck to hold weekday games in 1910 at Pioneer Park. Because of its location outside city limits, Sunday games continued to be held at Athletic Park through at least 1911.\nEach of these early Muskogee baseball venues had significant drawbacks. Athletic Park \"could not be excelled\" as a facility, but many felt it was too far from the city center. Benson Park not only had a remote location, but also had taken the name Dean Park after the African-American neighborhood now surrounding it and was by that time used largely by \"colored teams.\" Pioneer Park had a central location, but after the lease expired the owners sold the land and it was developed for other purposes. Beginning in 1911, therefore, Muskogee teams started playing weekday games at Owen Field, which was located near 5th Street and Boston Street. Owen Field was named after landowner Robert Owen, whose home was on the property that adjoined the ball field. Although the open space at Owen Field had previously been used for other community events, it initially had significant drawbacks as a baseball field, including an alley running through the middle of the field. There was also significant opposition from neighboring residents. Gradually, however, the alley was closed and telephone poles and other structures that interfered with play were removed. By the 1926 season, the last remaining structure on the block, a house at 4th and Boston, had been removed. The grandstand and bleachers were moved northward to the corner of 5th and Boston to take advantage of this additional space.\nLater, the Owen Field property became known as League Park and Athletic Park. From 1921 to 1926 Muskogee teams played at the site, renamed League Park. Beginning in 1934, the site was renamed Athletic Park and hosted the Muskogee Tigers, Muskogee Reds and Muskogee Giants. The ballpark had a capacity of 4,500 (1939); 6,000 (1940); 2,400 (1936) and 3,500 (1950). It had dimensions (Left, Center, Right) of 298-415-334 (1939) and 300-385-334 (1940).\nIn April 1923, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees with Babe Ruth, played an exhibition game at Owen Field. Later, Mickey Mantle played for the Joplin Miners in games at Athletic Park in 1950.\nBecause of its location near Owen Field/Athletic Park, visiting teams stayed at the Severs Hotel.\nToday, the site of Owen Field/Athletic Park is the location of the Muskogee Civic Center. The address is 425 Boston Street, Muskogee, Oklahoma."

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 2007-08 began on June 23, 2007, and the host school for the season was Jose Rizal University.\nThe Knights finished the double round-robin eliminations at second place with 9 wins against 3 losses. After a 4–0 start, they were dealt with their first loss of the season against the hosts, JRU Heavy Bombers. Their win against San Beda in the first-round ensured a #1 finish for the Knights, but Mapúa denied them another 4–0 streak as MVP candidate Kelvin dela Peña lead the Cardinals with an almost triple-double performance. Letran faced San Beda again in the second-round, but the Red Lions avenged their first-round loss thanks to Borgie Hermida's late-game heroics. After the game, some coaching staffs and supporters from both teams engaged in a brawl.\nLetran then eliminated JRU in the Final Four to face the defending champions San Beda Red Lions for the first time in the Finals after 57 years. The Knights, however, were swept by the Red Lions in two games. Bryan Faundo and Dino Daa were named members of the Mythical Five.\nRoster.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nNCAA Season 83 games results.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format.

        "title": "2022 Iga Świątek tennis season",
        "text": "The 2022 Iga Świątek tennis season officially began on 3 January 2022 as the start of the 2022 WTA Tour. Iga Świątek entered the season as world number 9. The season saw the Polish player become the twenty-eighth world number 1 player in singles. A 37-match win streak was accumulated during the season, the longest in the twenty-first century.\nSeason summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nŚwiątek started her season at the Adelaide International in January, seeded fifth. After wins against Daria Saville, Leylah Fernandez, and Victoria Azarenka, Świątek lost to Ashleigh Barty in the semifinals. She was scheduled to play at the Sydney International, seeded sixth, and her first match was scheduled to be against Emma Raducanu, but she pulled out of the tournament due to a rib injury.\nŚwiątek entered into the Australian Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated qualifier Harriet Dart in the first round, Rebecca Peterson in the second round and Daria Kasatkina in the third round. All wins were in straight sets. She reached her first Australian Open quarterfinal after defeating Sorana Cîrstea in the fourth round. As of January 2022, Świątek has reached the second week of a Grand Slam at six consecutive majors, beginning with her 2020 French Open title, setting a record for the longest streak of second-week progressions. In the quarterfinal she defeated Kaia Kanepi in a match at three hours and one minute before losing to Danielle Collins in the semifinal the following day.\nIn February, Świątek entered into the Qatar Open, where she was seeded seventh. She defeated Viktorija Golubic and Daria Kasatkina in the second and third rounds, respectively. In the quarterfinals, she defeated top seeded Aryna Sabalenka before advancing to the semifinals where she played against Maria Sakkari, winning in straight sets. In the final, she won against fourth-seeded Anett Kontaveit, losing only two games, to claim her second WTA 1000 championship title.\nMarch Sunshine Double.\nAt Indian Wells, Świątek reached her third WTA 1000 final, where, as the third seed, she defeated Anhelina Kalinina, Clara Tauson and Angelique Kerber in three sets, and Madison Keys and Simona Halep, in straight sets. She defeated sixth seed Maria Sakkari, in straight sets, to win her fifth title. With the back-to-back Masters wins, Świątek reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2.\nThe following week, Świątek was seeded second at the Miami Open. Due to the retirement of reigning world No. 1, Ashleigh Barty, on 23 March, Świątek clinched the world No. 1 singles ranking after her second-round victory over Viktorija Golubic. The new ranking was applied on 4 April, after Barty was officially removed from the rankings. Świątek is the only Polish tennis player, male or female, to have ever held the number 1 ranking in singles, and the second Polish tennis player after Łukasz Kubot to hold a number-one ranking in singles or doubles. She then advanced to the final without dropping a set, recording victories over Madison Brengle, 14th seed Coco Gauff, 28th seed Petra Kvitová, and 16th seed Jessica Pegula. She beat Naomi Osaka in the final, becoming the fourth as well as the youngest woman (11th player overall) to complete the Sunshine Double and also the 1st woman to win the first three WTA 1000 events of the year.\nClay season.\nIn April, Świątek participated at Stuttgart Open as the top seed after withdrawing from Charleston Open for a short time rest. She began by defeating Eva Lys and Emma Raducanu. In the semifinal, Świątek lost the first set in a tiebreak against Liudmila Samsonova but came back to win the next two sets. It was a 3 hours and 3 minutes match that not only ended up being the longest of her career then, but ended her 28-set winning streak before reaching her fourth final of the season. In the final she played against the third seed Aryna Sabalenka, winning in straight sets and claiming her fourth consecutive WTA title. However, on 27 April 2022, it was announced that Świątek pulled out of the Madrid Open due to her right shoulder injury. She said she will be taking a break to treat her arm, and will also be preparing for the upcoming Italian Open in Rome and French Open in Paris. After pulling out of Madrid, Świątek spent some time training at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca.\nAt the Italian Open, as the defending champion, she reached yet another WTA 1000 final, her fourth for the season, defeating Elena-Gabriela Ruse, Victoria Azarenka, Bianca Andreescu and Aryna Sabalenka. She also became the seventh player to reach two finals in Rome before turning 21. In the final, she beat Ons Jabeur in straight sets to claim her fifth consecutive WTA Tour title. She finished with a 28-match winning streak.\nAs world No. 1 entering the French Open, Świątek defeated Lesia Tsurenko, Alison Riske, and Danka Kovinić, all in straight sets. In the fourth round she defeated Chinese teenager Zheng Qinwen in three sets, losing the first set despite having five set points and leads in both the set and the tiebreak. Świątek made the semifinals defeating Jessica Pegula. She went one step further to reach the final by defeating Daria Kasatkina. In the final, Świątek conquered Coco Gauff and clinched her second French Open title, losing one set en route. She became only the 10th woman to win multiple French Open singles titles in the Open era. Having just turned 21, Świątek was the fourth youngest player to triumph more than once in Paris after Monica Seles, Steffi Graf, and Chris Evert who were younger. She finished the tournament with a 35-match winning streak, matching the longest unbeaten streak since Venus Williams in 2000 and becoming the 8th woman in the Open Era with 35 or more wins in a row.\nWimbledon and home event.\nAt Wimbledon, Świątek won her first and second-round matches before losing to Alizé Cornet in straight sets in round three. This ended her 37 match win streak, the longest such streak in the 21st century.\nAt the Poland Open, she defeated compatriot Magdalena Fręch in the first round before winning against Gabriela Lee in the second round. In the quarterfinals she was upset in three sets by the fifth seed Caroline Garcia who went on to win the title. The defeat ended her 18-match winning streak on clay.\nUS Open series.\nLeading up to the US Open during the North American summer, Świątek early exited at Toronto and Cincinnati. She lost the third round to Beatriz Haddad Maia and Madison Keys, respectively.\nEntering the US Open, Świątek defeated Jasmine Paolini, the former champion Sloane Stephens, and Lauren Davis in a row. She reached the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major and the third of the season defeating Jule Niemeier to become the first Polish woman to reach this level at this Grand Slam. Afterwards, she defeated eighth seed Jessica Pegula to reach the semifinals for the first time in Flushing Meadows, followed by a defeat of 6th seed Aryna Sabalenka and a straight-sets victory in the final over Ons Jabeur. She is the first Polish woman to win the US Open bringing her to a total of three major titles.\nClosing tournaments.\nAt Ostrava Open, she reached the final after defeating Ajla Tomljanović, Caty McNally and Ekaterina Alexandrova on the way. The win over Alexandrova was her 60th win of the season. In the final, she played the longest match of her career so far lasting 3 hours and 16 minutes against Barbora Krejčíková which she lost in three sets. The defeat also ended her ten consecutive WTA Tour finals win streak. It marked the first loss of the final in 2022 and the second one of her career.\nSubsequently, Świątek played at San Diego Open, defeating Zheng Qinwen, Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, and the qualifier Donna Vekić in the final, which made it her eighth title of the season. Świątek became the first player since Serena Williams in 2013 to claim the most titles (8), to win the most matches (67) and to achieve the most 'bagels' in a year (22).\nAt the 2022 WTA Finals held in Fort Worth, Texas, she won the group stage without dropping a set defeating Daria Kasatkina, Caroline Garcia and Coco Gauff respectively. Although she lost in the semifinal to Aryna Sabalenka, she still posted a record win-loss 67–9 in 2022, the most wins in a single season since Serena Williams in 2013. She also became the first player since Serena Williams in 2013 to collect over 11,000 ranking points in a single season."

        "text": "The India cricket team toured the West Indies and the United States during July and August 2022 to play three One Day Internationals (ODIs) and five Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODIs and the first T20I took place in Trinidad and Tobago, the next two T20Is were played in St. Kitts and Nevis, with the final two T20Is played in Lauderhill, Florida. The full details of the tour were confirmed on 1 June 2022.\nIn the first ODI, India batted first and made 308/7, going on to win the match by just three runs, with the West Indies making 305/6 from their 50 overs. India won the second ODI by two wickets, with just two balls left in the match, to win the series with a match to play. India won the third and final ODI by 119 runs, to take the series 3–0.\nBackground.\nOn July 31, after the 1st T20I between West Indies and India, there was an uncertainty on both the team's last two games in the United States, as the members of both the sides did not receive their US visas on time, which forced CWI to think of an alternate plan of scheduling last two matches in West Indies itself. The initial plan was to handover the US travel documents to both teams in St Kitts, when they arrived as the last two matches were scheduled to be held in Central Broward Park in Lauderhill in Florida on August 6 and August 7.\nAfter the 3rd T20I, the teams flew to Georgetown in Guyana after CWI arranged their appointments; with the intervention and diplomatic efforts by Guyana's President Irfaan Ali, both the teams received their visas and the matches went ahead as scheduled. 14 members of the Indian team did not have the travel approvals including the coaching staff, and they had to attend the interviews to get their visas approved which included Indian team's captain Rohit Sharma and coach Rahul Dravid. While Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Dinesh Karthik, Ravi Bishnoi, Suryakumar Yadav and Kuldeep Yadav were already present in Miami as they had their visas issued to them before.\nSquads.\nThe West Indies also named Romario Shepherd and Hayden Walsh Jr. as reserve players for the ODI matches. Ahead of the first ODI, Romario Shepherd was added to the West Indies' squad, after Jason Holder tested positive for COVID-19. Hayden Walsh Jr. was added to the West Indies squad for the second ODI after Gudakesh Motie fractured a thumb in the first match.\nRavindra Jadeja was initially ruled out of India's squad for the first two ODI matches due to a knee injury. He was later ruled out of the third ODI after not recovering from the injury, with Shreyas Iyer named as the team's vice-captain for the series in place of Jadeja. KL Rahul not selected in India's ODI squad due to a sports hernia, but he was selected for the T20I squad. However, he then tested positive for COVID-19, and was ruled out of the T20I series. Sanju Samson was later named as Rahul's replacement for the T20I series andHardik Pandya was appointed as the team's vice-captain for the T20I series. During the fourth T20I, Harshal Patel was ruled out after a rib injury, without playing a single match in the series."

However, Guyana - the favourites - withdrew a few weeks before the tournament citing financial difficulties, and Jamaica then withdrew on the eve of the event for similar reasons. The result was a very one-sided affair, with Trinidad retaining their title without conceding a point.\nThe tournament included test match debuts for both Barbados and St Vincent - and for both it was a painful introduction to the game. Barbados were blown away by the Caymans in their opening game - the visitors being \"just too big and rough for [Barbados'] young inexperienced side\" while their second game ended early due to injury.\nSt Vincent's debut was not different. In their opening game \"the scrums went uncontested after about ten minutes as they just could not cope with the pressure. As it was they had some nasty injuries, so that made things even worse\"."

The top 64 players from the prize money rankings after the 2022 World Championship, and 30 players earning a two-year card the previous year automatically qualify for the season.

Nine players from international championships and two players from the Q Tour are offered the tour cards. One player comes from the CBSA China Tour and two players from World Women's Snooker. 16 places are available through the Q School, four from each of the three UK events and two from each of the two Asia-Oceania Q School events). The last two tour cards are invitational tour cards, given to Stephen Hendry and Ken Doherty.\nAs one of the winners from the inaugural Q School Asia &amp; Oceania qualification event, former professional player Thanawat Thirapongpaiboon was eligible to receive a fresh two-year tour card. However, on 22 June 2022, the WPBSA and the World Snooker Tour declined to offer him a tour card, citing \"serious disciplinary matters from when Thanawat was previously a professional player in 2015\" as the reason, later announced to be a resumption of a previous investigation into match-fixing that had been closed due to Thanawat having fallen off the tour at the time. His place was therefore offered to Asjad Iqbal, who was the next in line on the Asia-Oceania Q School Order of Merit.\nNew professional players.\nAll players listed below received a tour card for two seasons.\nCalendar.\nThe following tables outline the dates and results for all the World Snooker Tour, World Women's Snooker Tour, World Seniors Tour, Q Tour, and other events in the season."

Two early tries from centre Lolitta Hanna provided Cayman with an early 10 point lead and further tries from Lisa Bird and Emily Davies and a katie Bayles conversion gave Cayman a commanding 22-0 half time lead.

The countries occupying positions 8 to 15 on the ranking of the qualified teams were allocated to Pot 2, while the 16th to 23rd best-ranked qualifiers were placed in Pot 3. Finally, Pot 4 included the qualified teams in positions 24 to 28, plus three placeholders representing the two winners of the intercontinental play-offs and the remaining UEFA play-off winners. The hosts continued to be placed in Pot 1 and treated as a seeded team, and therefore Pot 1 consisted of hosts Qatar and the seven highest-ranked teams that qualified for the tournament.\nThe draw sequence started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4.\nPersonnel involved.\nThe 32 nations involved in the 2022 World Cup (29 of which were known) were drawn into eight groups of four. Two of the remaining three spots were filled by the winners of the intercontinental play-offs on 13 or 14 June, with the third berth determined by Path A of the European qualifying play-offs, which was delayed due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas, and Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matthäus (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinović (Serbia/USA/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).\nSeeding.\nTeams were seeded using the March 2022 FIFA World Rankings (shown in parentheses), which were published on 31 March 2022.\nThe highest-ranked team not to qualify for the World Cup, and also the only team from the top 16 in the rankings not to qualify, was sixth-ranked Italy.\nFinal draw.\nThe eight groups were formed randomly, selecting one team from each of the four pots. Two teams from the same confederation could not be placed into the same group, with the exception of UEFA teams, where up to two teams could be in the same group. The only team whose position in the draw was predetermined was the host Qatar, who were placed into position A1."

        "text": "The Air Force–Army men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey and Army Black Knights men's ice hockey programs. The first official meeting between the two occurred on January 26, 1976 but didn't become an annual event until 1989.\nHistory.\nArmy was one of the first college teams in the country, playing their first games in 1904. Air Force didn't start play until more than 60 years later but, due to the vast distance between the two campuses, the teams didn't play one another for several seasons. When the NCAA reorganized into numerical divisions in 1973, Army was dropped down to Division II in part because they still used an open-air rink as their home facility. The Smith Rink served as Army's home from 1930 to 1985 but, once the program began to build the more modern Tate Rink, the program was allowed back into top division. Army then played as a part-time member of ECAC Hockey until the late 1980s, after which, the team played as an independent. This coincided with Army and Air Force beginning an annual rivalry.\nFor the first decade of play between the two service academies, the teams alternated hosting duties. That trend continued once they both joined College Hockey America in 2000, however, Army left after just one season to join the MAAC, an east coast conference. Air Force remained with the CHA for several years before following in Army's footsteps, joining the MAAC successor, Atlantic Hockey in 2007. Over the span of 15 years, Air Force and Army have met 5 times in the conference tournament with the Falcons winning every series.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

        "text": "The Sarajevo Winter Olympics Museum is a museum dedicated to the XIV Winter Olympic Games and the XIV European Youth Olympic Winter Festival that were both held respectively in 1984 and 2019 in Sarajevo.\nIt was founded by the decision of the Organizing Committee of the XIV Winter Olympic Games with the desire to permanently preserve the memory of the organization and the Olympic event. The museum opened on February 8, 1984.\nThe museum realized more than 300 thematic programs from 1984 to 1992. The museum was destroyed on April 27, 1992, during the Siege of Sarajevo. Saved artifacts were transferred to a new Olympic museum that opened in 2004 on the 20th anniversary of the Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo which is located in the Zetra Olympic Hall.\nOn October 8, 2020, the museum was reopened and had new features from the 2019 Winter Olympic youth festival that was held in Sarajevo and East Sarajevo.\nHistory.\nThe building of the Olympic Museum, the “Mandić Villa”, was built for the lawyer in Sarajevo, Nikola Mandić in 1903, according to the project of Karel Pařík. It used to be the seat of the American Consulate, and more recently of the City Committee of SC Sarajevo. The Villa was built on the very edge of the slope with a beautiful view of the city according to the pattern of the courts and palaces of the aristocracy. It is connected to the Markale market and the center of Sarajevo by a series of stairs. Behind it peeks the tower of the villa of Heinrik Reiter, one of the directors of the brewery in Sarajevo, which was also designed by Pařík at the same time as Mandić's villa was built.\nIn the presence of the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the museum was officially opened on February 8, 1984, on the opening day of the XIV Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. On April 27, 1992, the museum was destroyed and a majority of its artifacts were lost in the fire.\nIn January 1998, academician Ivan Straus developed a \"Project for the reconstruction and new functional organization of the Museum of the XIV Winter Olympic Games in Sarajevo\", and later the conceptual design. Based on this, in December 1999, architect Dragan Bijedić and civil engineer Vladimir Savković, within the designer firm \"Architect\", made a detailed design called \"Olympic Academy Sarajevo, a design for the remediation of the construction.\" The realization of this project began in 2000, which put the facility on the list of cultural assets of special national interest for BiH. It is for this reason that the Institute for the Protection of Monuments monitored the activities, both in the design and in the implementation of the designed solutions.\nAlthough the renovation of the museum lasted from its devastation in 1992 until today in very difficult socio-economic conditions, it was successfully completed, primarily because of the Olympic Committee of BiH, Olympic Solidarity, the City of Sarajevo, but also the wider community."

With the American Hockey League (AHL) season delayed alongside the NHL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Patera was loaned to his former Czech club of České Budějovice, where he played 15 games during the 2020–21 Extraliga season. Patera would then join Vegas' AHL affiliate, the Henderson Silver Knights, for the 2020–21 AHL season.\nDuring the season, with the Golden Knights suffering injuries to multiple goaltenders, Patera was recalled from the Silver Knights in March 2023. He then made his NHL debut on 12 March 2023, posting his first career win and saving 30 of 33 shots faced as the Golden Knights defeated the St. Louis Blues 5–3. Despite only playing in two regular-season games, Patera spent the majority of the 2023 playoffs on Vegas' active roster, serving as the third or fourth-string goaltender behind Laurent Brossoit, Adin Hill, and Jonathan Quick; as a result, Patera was subsequently a part of the Golden Knights' eventual Stanley Cup victory.\nAs a restricted free agent, Patera signed a one-year extension with Vegas on July 2, 2023. After beginning the season with Henderson, Patera was recalled to the Golden Knights on December 2 due to an injury to Adin Hill. Patera then made his 2023–24 season debut on December 10, stopping 35 of 39 shots in a 5–4 shootout victory over the San Jose Sharks.\nInternational play.\nPatera was named to the Czech under-18 team roster for the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, but did not play.

Official NCAA men's lacrosse records did not begin until the 1971 season and are based on information submitted to the NCAA statistics service by institutions participating in the weekly statistics rankings, which started in 1996. Career records include players who played at least three seasons (in a four-season career) or two (in a three-season career) in Division I during the era of official NCAA statistics. In statistical rankings, the rounding of percentages and/or averages may indicate ties where none exist. In these cases, the numerical order of the rankings is accurate.\nAlso included here are college lacrosse records from prior to 1971. Also, prior to 1971 there was not an official “Division I” as that is an NCAA designation. Prior to 1971, the USILA had informal “Large College” and “Small College” designations. Any USILA era records included here are “Large College” records.\nThese records are compiled from individual school records and are for players at schools which were considered the highest level lacrosse schools. Compiling and validating lacrosse records prior to the \"NCAA-era\" is hit-or-miss. In many cases, USILA era records can be gathered from a university's own record books. To date, the NCAA does not officially recognize lacrosse records prior to 1971 as well as several records during the NCAA era, and the USILA does not maintain a database of lacrosse records.\nCertain USILA era lacrosse records, nonetheless, have been included below.

        "title": "Croatia–Serbia basketball rivalry",
        "text": "The Croatia–Serbia basketball rivalry is a competitive sports rivalry that exists between the national basketball teams of the two countries and their respective sets of fans.\nHistory.\nThe big rivalry in basketball started at the FIBA European Championship in 1995, in Athens. At the time, Croatia was a newly independent state, while Serbia was a federal unit of FR Yugoslavia. Both countries did well in the tournament, with Yugoslavia ranking first. The third-place Croatian team caused an international scandal when they walked off the medal stand and out of the arena just before Serbs and Montenegrins were about to receive their gold medals. Curiously, there hasn't been a single direct game involving the two countries over the course of the championship.\nCroatia and Yugoslavia did face each other in a game at EuroBasket 1997. Four seconds before the end of the tense game, Croatian team was leading by two points when Serbian guard Aleksandar Đorđević took the ball and made a three-pointer, winning the game for Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia went on to win the championship, while Croatia ended up ranking 11th overall.\nAfterward, at EuroBasket 2001, Croats were heavily beaten by 80–66.\nSerbia defeated Croatia, 86–83, in the last quarterfinal of the Olympic Basketball Tournament on 17 August 2016 to set up a semifinal clash with Australia. On 19 August, Serbia cruised to a resounding 87–61 win over Australia. Serbia won the silver medal following a 96–66 lost to the United States in the final. Croatia finished at 5th place.\nHead-to-head.\n2000 Trofeo Lido delle Rose in Roseto, Italy.\n Croatia\n Yugoslavia\n\"Number in parentheses indicates points scored in the game.\"\n2005 ProMonte Supercup in Podgorica.\n Serbia and Montenegro\n Croatia\n\"Number in parentheses indicates points scored in the game.\"\n2007 Trofeo Diego Gianatti in Bormio, Italy.\n Croatia\n Serbia\n\"Number in parentheses indicates points scored in the game.\"\n2010 FIBA World Championship.\nThe first eighth-final round match-up pitted two former Yugoslav republics against each other as Group A winner Serbia met Group B fourth-place finisher Croatia, the first meeting for the teams in a major international tournament. Serbia prevailed 73–72 in a back-and-forth battle that neither team led by more than eight points at any point during the game. Milan Mačvan, Serbia's youngest player at age 20, drained a three-pointer to extend Serbia's lead to 64–57 with 4:24 remaining before Croatia began a late comeback to pull within one at 68–67 with 24 seconds left in the game. Aleksandar Rašić hit two free throws to extend the lead to three with 21 seconds left before Croatia's Marko Popović answered with two free throws of his own with 15 seconds left. Marko Tomas then stole the ensuing inbounds pass and dished to Popović, who was fouled with 11 seconds left. Popović made only one of two free throws to tie the game at 70 and set up a dramatic finish.\nSerbia freed Rašić with a screen on the ensuing inbounds pass and he made an uncontested layup with nine seconds left. Popović was then fouled with 5.9 seconds left, and hit both free throws to tie the game at 72. Serbia inbounded the ball to Rašić, who drove downcourt and was fouled by Croatia's Davor Kus while attempting an off-balance shot with one second left. Rašić made the first and missed the second free throw to give Serbia a one-point victory. Rašić ended up with 15 points, including eight in the fourth quarter and five in the final 21 seconds. Croatia's Popović led all scorers with 21 points to go along with five rebounds and five assists. The Oklahoma City Thunder's Nenad Krstić scored a team-high 16 points for Serbia.\n2011 Adecco Ex-Yu Cup in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nThe 2011 game was a part of exhibition tournament for the EuroBasket 2011. Serbia had a 80–71 win over Croatia in the tournament final on 9 August 2011. Croatia led for most of the game, seven minutes before the end of the game it reached the 10 points margin, 67–57, but then played very poorly in the game closure. With a 13–0 run, Serbia took the lead, 67–70, two minutes before the end, and then increased its advantage to the final nine point lead, 71–80, by the end of the game. Croatia was led by forward Bojan Bogdanović with 17 points, while center Nenad Krstić was the most efficient in Serbia with 18 points scored.\n2011 London Invitational.\nCroatia national team was able to successfully open its London Tournament campaign with the initial 83–71 win over rival Serbia. Croatia took the lead just before the end of the first quarter (17–16), led at the half by 44–36 and reached 16-point surplus midway the last quarter before managing to stay on the top. Croatian guard Krunoslav Simon again displayed his excellent shooting stroke while leading the Croatia with 17 points (6–8 from the floor). Croatian center Ante Tomić added 13 points and 9 rebounds.\n2012 Adecco Ex-Yu Cup in Ljubljana, Slovenia.\nThe 2012 game was a part of exhibition tournament for the FIBA EuroBasket 2013 qualification in Slovenia. Croatia and Serbia had a very interesting game on the first day of the Adecco Cup on 3 August 2012. Serbia topped Croatia with final score of 90–74 and proved that they getting better form. Guard Miloš Teodosić led Serbia with great performances as he recorded 14 points, 9 assists and 4 rebounds. Forward Zoran Erceg added 14 points and Duško Savanović scored 13 points. It was obvious at the game that Serbia is much better team. Serbian coach Dušan Ivković even used last quarter to practice offense and defense combinations.\n2013 Spor Toto World Cup in Istanbul, Turkey.\nOn 23 August 2013, Serbia won over Croatia with an 88–71 score, in the first round of the Spor Toto World Cup in Istanbul, Turkey. The Dušan Ivković's team was much better for the most part of the interesting match. They gained a six-point lead at halftime, the Croats then tried to return to the match, but the Serbian players routinely secured a convincing victory with an excellent game in the last quarter. Success against a quality rival is a great encouragement for the Serbian team before participating in the EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia, and the tournament in Istanbul is the last test before the continental competition. The most efficient in the winning team were captain Nenad Krstić with 19, Raško Katić with 18 and Nemanja Bjelica with 14 points, while Marko Tomas stood out in the Croatian team with 16 points.\n2014 Tournament in Pau, France.\nCroatia suffered its second defeat at the exhibition tournament in Pau, France, after losing to Serbia 83–84 in overtime on 9 August 2014. In an equal match three minutes before the end, Croatia led 68–60, but the Serbs made 10–0 run in two minutes and took the lead 70–68. But then Croatian guard Oliver Lafayette scored a three-pointer and two free throws for the lead of the Croats 73–70. However, Serbian forward Marko Simonović scored 20 seconds before the game end and tied at 73–73 and the game went into overtime. In the additional five minutes, Croatia was in the lead, but six seconds before the end, Serbian guard Bogdan Bogdanović scored a three-pointer for Serbia's 84–83 lead. In the last run, Croatia tried through forward Bojan Bogdanović, but he missed a three-pointer and Serbia won 84–83 in the end. Serbia took what was offered, and Croatia suffered its defeat. Bojan Bogdanović was the best Croatian scorer with 19 points, and Luka Žorić 13, Damjan Rudež 11, Krunoslav Simon 11, and Oliver Lafayette scored 10 points. The Serbs were led by Marko Simonović with 24 points, Nemanja Bjelica scored 15 points and Miroslav Raduljica with 13 points joined them.\n2016 Super4 in Córdoba, Argentina.\nThe Croats were better for most of the first half. The central player in the composition of the Croats was Krunoslav Simon. By entering the game of Nemanja Nedović Serbia accelerated the game, a series of points from the transition followed, so the nine points minus was reduced to only one. Since Serbian guard Miloš Teodosić was not in the team, the Croats closed all the approaches under the basket, and conditionally speaking, they fired from a distance. Serbia was not served by a shot, but the other guys were up to the task, especially in defense. In the end, in the first half, Croatia led with 40–36. Simon scored 15 points, on the other hand, the central figure in the Serbian team was center Miroslav Raduljica with 11 points. At the beginning of the third section, with a triple by Bogdan Bogdanović, Serbia took the lead with 50–48. The main problem was still the Krunoslav Simon-Dario Šarić duo. Even then, it was clear that a match awaited us in which the nuances would decide. Croatian forward Bojan Bogdanović set up the targets, Raduljica kept Serbia in the game. Five minutes before the end, after Rok Stipčević's triple, the score was tied at 70–70. The Croats have scored 10 three-pointers so far. An uncertain ending followed. Serbian guard Stefan Marković hit a three-pointer for 79–77. Serbian guard Stefan Jović hit a three-pointer in the last second of the attack for 82–77. Croatia was broken at the time. More precisely, a miracle should have happened so that they could return to the match with the Croats. The mistake of the Croats, Nikola Kalinić's dunk from the counter, Bogdanovic's points and practically everything was clear.\n2016 Summer Olympics.\nSerbia defeated Croatia, 86–83, in the last quarterfinal of the Olympic Basketball Tournament on 17 August 2016 to set up a semifinal clash with Australia.\nIn the closest game of the day, the Serbs saw a 14-point third quarter lead melt away in the final frame as Croatia got within one several times down the stretch. But with time running out on them, Serbia had to foul to stop the clock and Serbians Miloš Teodosić and Nikola Jokić made good on their trips to the free-throw line in the final 18 seconds. There was little to separate the two teams in the first half, with Serbia up 20–19 at the end of the opening period and Croatia taking a 38–32 advantage at the break. Serbia took control thanks to a third quarter in which they outscored Croatia 34–14. They took their biggest lead of the night, 66–52, when guard Bogdan Bogdanović buried a three-pointer with 22 seconds left in the period. Croatia answered by going on a 22–7 run that got them within 74–73 on Darko Planinić's pair of free-throws with 3:26 remaining. Serbia stayed in front but Croatia were breathing down their neck. The Serbian side got a bit of breathing room when Miroslav Raduljica made the second of two foul shots to make it 79–75 with 27 seconds and that forced Croatia in having to foul intentionally to stop the clock but ultimately running out of time.\nHad Serbia rolled to a comfortable win on the back of their impressive third quarter, a great turning point could have been in the shape of Raduljica's postering dunk over Croatian forward Dario Šarić in transition for a 41–40 lead with 6:50 left to play in the period. Instead, the real turning point really came down to Serbia knocking down 6-of-6 free-throws in the dying seconds of the game. Serbia got 39 points from their reserves, compared to 26 for Croatia. Bogdanović (game-high 18 points before fouling out), Stefan Jović (9 points and 4 rebounds) and Milan Mačvan (8 points and 3 rebounds) each played key roles in the outcome of this game. Teodosić and Jokić didn't have huge games offensively, the former going only 2-of-11 for 9 points and the latter 3-of-8 for 12 points. But Teodosić handed out 10 assists and both players stepped up when it counted the most, knocking down shots from the charity stripe with the game on the line.\nStatistics.\n\"Note: Last updated on 17 August 2016\""

The team was originally scheduled to start in 2025 but was postponed to 2026 in June 2023. At the time of the team's founding, beach volleyball was the newest NCAA sport and was sponsored by 86 teams across the NCAA's three divisions.

All matches took place in one of 27 venues chosen to be played in that season. The format for the group stage was a round-robin. That meant all teams would face each other at least twice. The teams needed to qualify in the top 2 of their respective groups to qualify for the play-offs. The Stallions finished 1st in their group, and the Strikers finished 2nd. Both teams won at least 10 games during the group stage, but the Stallions lost 4 with one being washed out, and the Strikers lost 3, with one washed out.\nMatch.\nThe final match was played between the New Jersey Stallions and the Silicon Valley Strikers at Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina.\nSummary.\nThe New Jersey Stallions won the toss and elected to bat. In the first innings, the Stallions mustered up an opening 29-run partnership before Ramrattan was edged behind to Jariwala off a good ball from Roshon Primus. But, a 42 and 31 from Dominique Rikhi and Saiteja Mukkamalla helped it muster up a 60-run partnership to help the Stallions to 89/2, before a collapse would settle. Kulvinder Singh and Saurabh Netravalkar ripped apart the middle order, with late cameos from Stephen Wiig and Karan Patel as the Stallions folded for 141.\nThe Strikers' openers got off to a good start, with the first wicket falling at 28. Jariwala was caught by Wiig off Sachin Mylavarapu after bowling a wide outside-off bouncer. Strikers captain Unmukt Chand was the next to fall after smashing Rovman Powell for two sixes and one four. Shehan Jayasuriya fell soon after being run out by some good fielding from Justin Dill.

        "text": "The 2022 Minor League Cricket season final was a Twenty20 cricket match played on August 28, 2022, at Church Street Park, Morrisville between the Seattle Thunderbolts and the Atlanta Fire to determine the winner of the 2022 Minor League Cricket season of Minor League Cricket.\nRoad to the final.\nDuring the group stage of the 2022 Minor League Cricket season (MiLC) each team played a total of 14 matches, two against each of the other side of its group and its neighboring group (i.e. Southern and Eastern, Central and Western). All matches took place in one of 25 venues chosen to be played in that season. The format for the group stage was a double round-robin. That meant all teams would face each other at least twice. The teams needed to qualify in the top 2 of their respective groups to qualify for the play-offs. The Thunderbolts finished 2nd in their group, while the Fire finished 1st. The Thunderbolts won 11 and lost 4 games, while the Fire won 9 and lost 4, with one game washed out. In the play-offs, the Thunderbolts defeated the Dallas Mustangs 2–0 in a 3-match-series to advance to the semi-finals, where they defeated the Silicon Valley Strikers by 6 runs to advance to the finals. The Fire defeated the Manhattan Yorkers 1–0 in a 3-match-series to advance to the semi-finals, where they defeated the New Jersey Stallions by 96 runs to advance to the finals.\nMatch.\nThe final match was played between the Seattle Thunderbolts and the Atlanta Fire at Church Street Park, Morrisville, North Carolina.\nSummary.\nThe Seattle Thunderbolts won the toss and elected to bowl. Corné Dry dismissed opening batter Rayyan Pathan for a duck on the third ball of the match to bring in captain Harmeet Singh. Singh accelerated the innings, hitting Steven Taylor for four fours, before being dismissed for 20 by Nasir Hossain. This brought in Shubham Ranjane to the crease with Andries Gous. Gous and Ranjane stretched together a 57-run partnership before Gous was caught out by Evroy Dyer off Taylor. Taylor then proceeded to take the wicket of Rishi Bhardwaj for 7. Ranjane then brought up fifty as Shadley van Schalkwyk launched Dry and Taylor for a flurry of boundaries. Ranjane eventually was dismissed for 51 by Taylor in the final over, with Schalkwyk and Prajith Mudi taking the Thunderbolts to 157/5 after 20.\nOpeners Steven Taylor and Zain Sayed got the Fire off to a good start, with Taylor smacking Schalkwyk and Bodugum for 3 fours, before being dismissed by Bodugum for 14. This brought in Aaron Jones to the crease by Sayed, who stitched a run-a-ball 58-run partnership, before season MVP Phani Simhadri dismissed Sayed for 26. Ranjane then came in to bowl, and immediately took the wicket of Nasir Hossain for 7, and Jahmar Hamilton for 4. Dry stuck around with Jones, with Jones bringing up his half-century, before departing for 64 off Ranjane. Ranjane then took the wicket of Amila Aponso the very next ball. Evroy Dyer was then dismissed by Simhadri for 6, and very next ball, Dry for 14. Jay Pathak was then run out in the final over for 3, as the Thunderbolts defeated the Fire by 10 runs to win the 2022 Minor League Cricket season.\nScorecard.\nNotes:\nToss: Seattle Thunderbolts won the toss and elected to bat.\nFall of wickets: 0/1 (Rayyan Pathan, 0.3 ov), 49/2 (Harmeet Singh, 5.4 ov), 106/3 (Andries Gous, 15.1 ov), 114/4 (Rishi Bhardwaj, 15.5 ov), 149/5 (Shubham Ranjane, 19.4 ov)\n\"Target:\"' 158 runs from 20 overs at 7.85 RR\nFall of wickets: 1/15 (Steven Taylor, 1.2 ov), 73/2 (Zain Sayed, 10.2 ov), 84/3 (Nasir Hossain, 12.3 ov), 96/4 (Jahmar Hamilton, 14.5 ov), 132/5 (Aaron Jones, 17.4 ov), 132/6 (Amila Aponso), 140/7 (Evroy Dyer, 18.5 ov), 140/8 (Corné Dry, 18.6 ov), 143/9 (Jay Pathak, 19.2 ov)"

        "text": "The 2022 Southern Conference baseball tournament was held from May 25 through 29 at Fluor Field at the West End in Greenville, South Carolina. The annual event determines the conference champion of the Division I Southern Conference in college baseball. The tournament winner earns the league's bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. This is the last of 20 athletic championships held by the conference in the 2021–22 academic year.\nThe tournament was originally held from 1950 to 1953, when the Southern Conference was a large conference composed of several small schools and several large schools, the latter of which would form the Atlantic Coast Conference after the 1953 season. The event was re-established in 1984 and has been held every year since with the exception of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled sporting events across the country. Western Carolina has claimed ten championships, the most of any school, with The Citadel close behind at eight tournament wins. Defending champion Samford has three championships, while Mercer has won two. East Tennessee State and VMI have never won a title, although they both returned to the conference in 2015 after over ten years in other conferences. Furman, which dropped its baseball program before the 2021 season, won two titles.\nThe tournament will be played in Greenville, which has hosted eight of the past twelve events, including the past five.\nSeeding and format.\nAfter only including four teams in 2021, the 2022 tournament will return to the previous format. All eight teams will participate in the tournament, with the bottom four seeds playing a single-elimination play-in round. The winners of the single elimination games will join the top 4 teams in the double-elimination tournament. The #3 and #4 seeds will play the winners of the single elimination games in the second round. The #1 and #2 seeds have a bye until the third round where they will play the winners of the second round. The championship will be a double elimination."

        "title": "List of Negro league baseball postseason games",
        "text": "This list of Negro league postseason games includes postseason participants of black baseball prior to the organization of any traditional Negro league and goes through to the collapse of segregated baseball after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line in 1946. Games include self-declared, regional and league champions, primarily in the \"major league\" era of Negro league baseball from 1920 to 1948. While black baseball did first play in 1867, postseason baseball can only be traced to 1913. As such, series length varied from time to time from best-of-two to best-of-five to even best-of-fourteen, and in postseason history there were thirteen ties (usually due to curfew rules). Negro baseball did continue after 1948, but it was at a quality that was considered minor by news of the time and historians. Historical research has revealed the existence of 23 years in which there was a postseason series held between Negro league teams. Box scores exist for just a fraction of the games.\n1913 and 1921.\nWhile the Negro leagues from 1920 to 1948 are retroactively considered \"major league\", black baseball had existed for several years prior, with varying levels of organization. 1913 was a matchup of two teams considered the best of their regions: the New York Lincoln Giants of the East, and the Chicago American Giants of the West (as a whole, the \"West\" region for baseball at any level was considered to be in the city of Chicago or St. Louis, with the actual West Coast being reserved to other interests). Of all the matchups in Negro league playoff history, this one ended up being the most comprehensive of them all, as it was played over the span of three weeks in two different cities with fourteen games played. New York won eight games while Chicago won five (game two ended in a tie).\n1913.\n1913 Championship Series: New York Lincoln Giants vs. Chicago American Giants \"(New York wins series 8–5–1)\"\nBox scores.\nGame 1\nGame 2\nGame 3\nGame 4\nGame 5\nGame 6\nGame 7\nGame 8\nGame 9\nGame 10\nGame 11\nGame 12\nGame 13\nGame 14\n1921.\nThe first Negro National League formed in 1920 with eight teams, with Rube Foster leading the way with his Chicago American Giants. While the organization of a league did not mean a uniform number of games, the league pennant was generally awarded to the team with the best winning percentage, although there would be numerous occasions when a League Championship Series would be held. At the conclusion of the 1921 season, Chicago had won their second straight NNL pennant. They accepted a challenge to meet the team considered the best of the East Coast in the Hilldale Club (two years later, the team was one of the founding members of the Eastern Colored League). Six games were played over the course of eleven days in three different cities as Hilldale won the series three games to two.\n1921 Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Hilldale Club \"(Hilldale wins series 3–2–1)\"\nBox scores.\nGame 1\nGame 2\nGame 3\nGame 4\nGame 5\nGame 6\nColored World Series era.\nIn 1924, the Negro National League and the Eastern Colored League agreed to meet in a postseason series of the two best teams in each league, which would be called a \"Colored World Series\". Since its inception, the National League had done a split-season schedule with first and second halves.\n1924.\n1924 Colored World Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. Hilldale Club \"(Monarchs wins series 5–4–1)\"\n1925.\nIn 1925, for the first time ever, two different teams were champions of the split-half season, necessitating a Championship Series to determine the pennant, as Kansas City won the first half and the St. Louis Stars won the second half. The two teams initially agreed to a best-of-nine series before settling to seven due to scheduling problems. Bizarrely, the Monarchs played their home games not in Kansas City but in Chicago, and the final two games of the series were played as a double-header.\n1925 Negro National League Championship Series: St. Louis Stars vs. Kansas City Monarchs \"(Kansas City wins series 4–3)\"\nBox scores.\nGame 1\nGame 2\nGame 3\nGame 4\nGame 5\nGame 6\nGame 7\n1925 Colored World Series: Hilldale Club vs. Kansas City Monarchs \"(Hilldale wins series 5–1)\"\n1926.\nIn 1926, the first-half champion Kansas City Monarchs played against the second-half champion Chicago American Giants in a best-of-nine series. Game 9 ended after just five innings, having been played the same day as Game 8. Bill Foster beat Bullet Rogan in both games as Chicago won the pennant.\n1926 Negro National League Championship Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. Chicago American Giants \"(Chicago wins series 5–4)\"\n1926 Colored World Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Bacharach Giants \"(Chicago wins series 5–4–2)\"\n1927.\nIn 1927, first-half champion Chicago met against second-half champion Birmingham Black Barons.\n1927 Negro National League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Birmingham Black Barons \"(Chicago wins series 4–1)\"\n1927 Colored World Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Bacharach Giants \"(Chicago wins series 5–3–1)\"\nWilderness era (1928–1941).\n1928.\nThe St. Louis Stars won the first half of the National League while the Chicago American Giants won the second half. The two-time defending league champion would play a best-of-nine series with the first four games in Chicago. However, it would be the Stars that would celebrate at the end of the series in St. Louis, as St. Louis recovered from a 4–3 series deficit by winning the final two games. They would not await the winner of the ECL, however. The ECL folded before finishing its season, thereby leaving the Stars as the lone league champion of the Negro leagues. 1929 saw the creation of the American Negro League and its one champion in the Baltimore Black Sox, but the ANL did not hold a playoff before it dissolved after the season ended.\n1928 Negro National League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. St. Louis Stars \"(St. Louis wins series 5–4)\"\n1930.\n1930 is considered to have had four postseason series, as teams from the East Coast challenged both each other and the National League for who was best among black baseball. It started with two games in April between the St. Louis Stars and the Homestead Grays, which the Grays won. On August 21, they then played Detroit Stars for four games over the course of a week, winning three of them before returning to St. Louis to play them for five games. The Stars won four of the matchups, with the last one played on September 3. The Grays then played an \"East Coast Championship Series\" against the New York Lincoln Giants, which was a best-of-ten series that saw Homestead win that took place from 9/20-9/28. Around the same time, St. Louis and Detroit met up for the NNL Championship Series from 9/13 to 9/22, with St. Louis winning over Detroit.\nEast-West Challenge Series: Homestead Grays vs. St. Louis Stars &amp; Detroit Stars\n1930 East Coast Championship Series: Homestead Grays vs New York Lincoln Giants \"(Grays win series 6–4)\"\n1930 Negro National League Championship Series: Detroit Stars vs. St. Louis Stars \"(St. Louis wins series 4–3)\"\n1932.\nThe Negro National League would have its first incarnation run until 1931. In 1932, two leagues came and went as \"major league\" status in the East-West League and Negro Southern League, but only the latter ran long enough to have a playoff series. The NSL was known for most of its history as a minor league, but 1932 saw the league composed of surviving NNL teams that made it a major league for this season only. As such, the NSL had a split-season schedule that saw its first half champion in the Chicago American Giants meet up against the second half champion Nashville Elite Giants for a Championship Series matchup.\n1932 Negro Southern League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Nashville Elite Giants \"(Chicago wins series 4–3)\"\n1934.\nThe Negro National League re-formed in 1933. Historians dispute if there was postseason play during the year, as several teams matched up against each other in games called \"playoff\" or \"exhibition\" matchups.\n1934 Negro National League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Philadelphia Stars \"(Philadelphia wins series 4–3–1)\"\n1935.\nSecond half champion New York Cubans was matched against first half champion Pittsburgh Crawfords. Pittsburgh came back from a 3–1 series deficit to win three straight games (all in Pittsburgh) to win the pennant. \n1935 Negro National League Championship Series: New York Cubans vs. Pittsburgh Crawfords \"(Crawfords win series 4–3)\"\n1936.\n1936 was the only year without a clear Championship Series winner. Both the first and second half champion were settled by disputes: The Washington Elite Giants played the Philadelphia Stars for the first half title, with the Giants winning 7–5 on September 17. The Pittsburgh Crawfords played the Newark Eagles in a five-game series that Pittsburgh won 3-1-(1) from 9/12-9/15. The Elite Giants and Crawfords played three games from September 21–27, but the Series was abandoned before it formerly ended, with Washington having won two games. Pittsburgh, having the best winning percentage among all teams, is generally considered the champion of the NNL.\n1937.\nWhile the Negro National League did not have a Championship Series in 1937, the Negro American League (formed that year) did.\n1937 Negro American League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Kansas City Monarchs \"(Kansas City wins series 4–1–1)\"\n1938.\nThe Negro American League attempted to hold a full-scale series for its pennant champion. The Memphis Red Sox won the first half of the season while the Atlanta Black Crackers won the second half. Two games were played in the Series but no further. The Black Crackers could not find a suitable venue to play their home games of the Series. It was decided two months later that the Red Sox were the champions of the league.\n1938 Negro American League Championship Series: Memphis Red Sox vs. Atlanta Black Crackers \"(Red Sox wins series 2–0)\"\n1939.\nFor the first time ever, both the Negro American League and the Negro National League held postseason series to determine their champion. In fact, the NNL went further and had a four-team playoff to determine the champion.\nNegro American League Championship Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. St. Louis Stars \"(Kansas City wins series 4–1)\"\n Negro National League Semifinals: Baltimore Elite Giants vs. Newark Eagles \"(Elite Giants wins series 3–1)\"\n Negro National League Semifinals: Homestead Grays vs. Philadelphia Stars \"(Grays wins series 3–2)\"\nNegro National League Championship Series: Baltimore Elite Giants vs. Homestead Grays \"(Elite Giants wins series 3–1–1)\"\n1941.\nThe Negro National League held a Championship Series in 1941 to determine its champion after the Homestead Grays won the first half and the New York Cubans won the second half.\n1941 Negro National League Championship Series: Homestead Grays vs. New York Cubans \"(Grays win series 3–1)\"\nNegro World Series era (1942–1948).\nIn 1937, the Negro American League had formed. Five years later, they would agree with the Negro National League II to a matchup of the two best teams of their leagues to a \"Negro World Series\", the first of its kind since the 1920s. They would meet each other for the next six years, before the dissolution of the National League in 1948 saw the demise of the World Series and \"major league\" Negro baseball as a whole. 1943 and 1948 were the only occasions that a League Championship Series had to be held to determine the champion of the pennant.\n1942.\nNegro World Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. Homestead Grays \"(Monarchs win series 4–0)\"\n1943.\nThe first-half champion Birmingham Black Barons were tasked to face the second-half champion Chicago American Giants for the Negro American League pennant; Birmingham won in five games for their first ever league pennant. \n1943 Negro American League Championship Series: Chicago American Giants vs. Birmingham Black Barons \"(Black Barons wins series 3–2)\"\n1943 Negro World Series: Birmingham Black Barons vs. Homestead Grays \"(Grays win series 4–3–1)\" \n1944.\nNegro World Series: Homestead Grays vs. Birmingham Black Barons \"(Grays win series 4–1)\"\n1945.\nNegro World Series: Cleveland Buckeyes vs. Homestead Grays \"(Buckeyes win series 4–0)\"\n1946.\n1946 Negro World Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. Newark Eagles \"(Eagles win series 4–3)\"\n1947.\n1947 Negro World Series: Cleveland Buckeyes vs. New York Cubans \"(Cubans win series 4–1–1)\"\n1948.\n1948 was the first time since 1939 that each League held a Championship Series to determine the pennant. The tie in Game 3 of the NNLCS proved key to the end of the Series. In the top of the 9th inning, Homestead had erased a 4–4 tie with four runs that saw them with the bases loaded. However, a curfew of 11:00pm had meant that the game would be reverted to the score of the previous inning, which was a 4–4 tie. A protest filed by the Grays came after the playing of Game 4 (a Baltimore win). The NNL ruled that Game 3 would be replayed from the point where it had stopped in the ninth inning, not the previous inning. Baltimore, rather than play to an 8–4 deficit, forfeited that game and with it the Series.\n1948 Negro American League Championship Series: Kansas City Monarchs vs. Birmingham Black Barons \"(Black Barons win series 4–3–1)\"\n1948 Negro National League Championship Series: Homestead Grays vs. Baltimore Elite Giants \"(Grays win series 2–1–1)\"\n1948 Negro World Series: Birmingham Black Barons vs. Homestead Grays \"(Grays win series 4–1)\""

        "title": "Carlton Fisk's 1975 World Series home run",
        "text": "Carlton Fisk's 1975 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series on October 21, 1975, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts. The Boston Red Sox defeated the Cincinnati Reds, 7–6, forcing a deciding seventh game, when Carlton Fisk hit a home run in the 12th inning home run to cap off what many consider to be the best World Series game ever played.\nFacing Reds right-hander Pat Darcy, Fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line. It appeared to be heading foul, but Fisk, after initially appearing unsure of whether or not to continue running to first base, famously jumped and waved his arms to the right as if to somehow direct the ball fair. It ricocheted off the foul pole.\nFisk's \"body English\", \"waving\" the ball fair, was captured on a TV camera stationed in the scoreboard.\nBackground.\nThe 1975 baseball season should have dawned for Red Sox fans with bright hopes. The team had made a legitimate run for the pennant the previous year, and this time the team had Carlton Fisk and Rick Wise for full seasons. Rick Burleson had surprised everyone by playing outstanding shortstop and hitting higher in the majors than he ever had in the minors. In addition, the Sox had two rookies who gave every indication they would be phenoms, Fred Lynn and Jim Rice. But the memory of the collapse of 1974 still hung heavy over New England fans.\nAt first most of the preseason talk had to do with the decision by Tony Conigliaro to try one more comeback and with the salary hassle concerning Luis Tiant, who felt he deserved more than $70,000 he was earning and wouldn't show up at Winter Haven, Florida, causing team owner Tom Yawkey to meet with \"El Tiante\", agree on a raise (to $90,000) and get the Sox pitching ace back in camp.\nStill, it didn't take too long before the stories and pictures coming out of Florida about the two phenoms got Sox fans thinking. The betting lines in Las Vegas had Boston as a long shot, although not the 100–1 shot they were in 1967. The odds against them went up, however, after Fisk, returning from the serious knee injury of 1974, was hit in the right arm and broke it. Even the positive talk about young Mr. Lynn couldn't drive away the gloom over Fisk's injury. Catching is absolutely vital to a successful team, and Fisk was going to be sidelined for at least a couple of months.\nThe word out of Florida on Lynn was very positive. The young man who had gone to the USC as a football linebacker, but gave up football for baseball, seemed to be doing it all. Not only did he hit and run and field, he was a good-looking, charming young man. He was a hit with Boston and New England fans and hit with power, and with the way big Jim Rice was clobbering the baseball, Boston appeared to have a power punch that could only get better when Fisk got back into the lineup.\nRick Wise, back after a year of shoulder trouble and then a broken finger, looked ready to boost a pitching staff, which already had Luis Tiant, Bill Lee, Reggie Cleveland, and the stringbean flame-thrower Roger Moret. The bullpen also looked strong, with Dick Drago as the closer and hard-thrower Dick Pole and veteran Diego Seguí.\nAdditionally, the word on Tony Conigliaro was encouraging, and that boosted spirits back home. Carl Yastrzemski was at first base, and after three short trials in previous years Cecil Cooper was going to make this team and probably be the designated hitter.\nWith 1975, the Big Red Machine lineup solidified with the starting team of Johnny Bench (c), Tony Pérez (1b), Joe Morgan (2b), Dave Concepción (ss), Pete Rose (3b), Ken Griffey (rf), César Gerónimo (cf), and George Foster (lf). The starting pitchers included Don Gullett, Fred Norman, Gary Nolan, Jack Billingham, Pat Darcy, and Clay Kirby. However, it was the bullpen that was the key to the Reds' pitching (and Anderson's reputation as \"Captain Hook\") with Rawly Eastwick and Will McEnaney as the key closers with a combined 37 saves. Pedro Borbón and Clay Carroll filled in as stretchers between the starters and the finishers. However, this was not the lineup on Opening Day.\nAt that time, Rose still played in left field and Foster was not a starter, while John Vukovich, an off-season acquisition from the Milwaukee Brewers was the starting third baseman, replacing Dan Driessen, who was a decent hitter, but whose defensive skills were considered a weakness. While Vuckovich was a superb defensive shortstop, he was a weak hitter, as was the declining Denis Menke. In May, with the team off to a slow start and trailing the Dodgers, Sparky Anderson made a bold move by moving Rose to third base (a position where he had very little experience) and inserting Foster in left field to bat cleanup. This was the jolt that the Reds needed to propel them into first place, with Rose proving to be reliable on defense, while adding Foster to the outfield gave the offense some added punch. During the season, the Reds compiled two notable streaks: (1) by winning 41 out of 50 games in one stretch, and (2) by going a month without committing any errors on defense.\nPostseason.\nCincinnati clinched the NL West with 108 victories, 20 games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers, then swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in three games to win the NL pennant.\nAfter a great season of their own, the Red Sox continued their magical season by sweeping the Oakland Athletics in three games in the American League Championship Series to advance to their first World Series since 1967. Carlton Fisk batted .417 in the ALCS.\nLuis Tiant won Games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2.\nIn the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World Series, in which Larry Barnett was working behind home plate, Cincinnati Reds hitter Ed Armbrister laid down a sacrifice bunt, and then collided with Boston Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk, who was trying to field the ball. Fisk committed a throwing error on the play after colliding with Armbrister, which led to the Reds' winning run. Barnett declined to make an interference call on Armbrister, despite Boston's pleas. Barnett's failure to call an interference was criticized by NBC television broadcaster Curt Gowdy (a former Red Sox announcer), who was particularly harsh in his comments, reputedly leading NBC to drop Gowdy from its baseball coverage. Gowdy had reportedly been given the correct interpretation of the rule—that interference can be called only if a batter \"intentionally\" gets in the way of a fielder—by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott (who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use it. Barnett later claimed he had received death threats on account of Gowdy's criticism.\nMore to the point, Tony Kubek, on the NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the attempted forceout), even though home plate umpire Barnett did not agree. Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. Prior to Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett declared, \"You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the right call.\" Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the \"same kind of mentality that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress.\"\nMajor League Baseball continues to this day to maintain that Barnett made the correct call. In fact, the Professional Baseball Umpires Corporation (the organization that oversees all minor league baseball umpires) instructs and teaches its umpires to make the same call as Barnett did should the same incident occur in a future game. Specifically, Major League Baseball has interpreted Rule 7.09(l) as saying \"a catcher trying to field a batted ball that remains in the immediate vicinity of the plate cannot be protected because of the right of the batter-runner to begin his advance to first. Barring an intentional action on the part of either player, contact in this instance is incidental, and is not interference...\" (Jaksa/Roder Umpires' Manual, 1997 Edition. Pg. 57).\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 6.\nGame 6 was postponed three days because of rain. Bernie Carbo did not join his teammates for batting practice at Tufts University because he said he couldn't find it. He spent the early part of Game 6 working on his Louisville Slugger. \"I’m sitting there and I’m whittling this bat, I took a lathe and took all the polish off. It's nice and smooth. Rick Wise is sitting next to me and says, ‘You know, you can’t use that bat. It doesn’t have an emblem on it.’ So as the game was going I took a magic marker and wrote ‘Louisville Slugger’ on it. That's how I kept myself amused.\"\nGame 6 played at Fenway Park is thought to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, game in postseason history. The Sox struck first on a 1st inning Fred Lynn blast. But by the 8th they were down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth when pinch hitter Carbo with two outs and two batters on base, hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Rawly Eastwick to tie the game. Bernie Carbo later said:\nAnd I said, \"Hey, I’m not going to hit. Juan Beníquez, grab a bat, you’re going to hit. Sparky's going to go to the lefthander because Sparky goes by the book.\" Darrell said, \"Well, go up and stand on the on-deck circle.\" And they introduced me. So I’m still thinking Sparky will come out and take Rawly Eastwick out and go with Will McEnaney. But the umpire says, \"C’mon, you’ve been announced, you’re hitting.\"\nSo I go into the batter's box. I ain't ready to hit. Next thing, strike one, strike two, ball one, ball two. Then he threw me a cut fastball, a little slider and I took it right out of Bench's glove – the ball just dribbled out. I step out and I’m thinking, \"Aw man, I almost struck out. I was lucky.\"\nI hit the next pitch to center field. I rounded first base and I saw César Gerónimo going back. Rounding second, I knew it was gone and I’m yelling to Pete Rose, \"Don’t you wish you were this strong?\" And Pete is yelling back, \"Ain’t this fun, Bernie? This is what the World Series is about. This is fun.\"\nJohnny Bench said after the game it looked like a Little Leaguer learning how to hit. Pete Rose said it was the worst swing he ever saw. Don Zimmer said he thought it was over. Rico Petrocelli said it looked like a pitcher who hurt his arm, trying to make a comeback as a hitter.\nIn the bottom of the ninth-inning, the score was tied 6–6 and the bases were loaded with no outs. Denny Doyle was on third base when Fred Lynn lifted a soft fly ball to short and shallow left field. After Reds left fielder George Foster made the catch, Doyle tagged up and attempted to score the winning run. He was thrown out at home plate, which inadvertently helped set the stage for Fisk's subsequent game-winning home run. After the game, Red Sox third-base coach Don Zimmer told the press, \"I was yelling 'no, no, no' and with the crowd noise, he (Doyle) thought I was saying 'go, go, go.'\" In a World Series that included five future Hall of Fame players, Doyle was the only player on either team to hit safely in all seven games.\nIn the top of the eleventh inning, right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled Ken Griffey Sr. at 1st base to preserve the tie.\nThe play.\nThe game went into extra innings and remained tied until the 12th inning when Carlton Fisk hit a pitch off of Pat Darcy of the Reds. In one of baseball's most iconic moments, Fisk waved his arms as if trying to keep the ball fair, before the ball hit the foul pole and was called a home run, winning the game for Boston. Satch Davidson was the one who called it a home run, saying he had a better view of the ball than the umpires at third base and in left field.\nThe left foul pole, renamed \"Fisk's Pole\" in honor of his' famous home run in the 1975 World Series, stands 310 feet away from home plate. During this time, cameramen covering baseball were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. In a 1999 interview, NBC cameraman Lou Gerard said that he had been distracted by a nearby rat. Unable to follow the ball, he kept the camera on Fisk instead. This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves.\nThe calls.\nNed Martin.\nDuring Martin's three decades with the Red Sox, he called the entire career of Hall-of-Famer Carl Yastrzemski, and was behind the microphone for some of baseball's most memorable moments, including the final win of the Red Sox \"Impossible Dream\" season of 1967, Carlton Fisk's game-winning home run off the foul pole in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, Yastrzemski's 400th home run and 3000th base hit in 1979, and Roger Clemens' first 20-strikeout game on April 29, 1986. Martin was known for his erudition and literary references during broadcasts (quotations from Shakespeare were not uncommon) and for his signature exclamation, \"Mercy!\", after an exciting play.\nCurt Gowdy was Martin's color man on that home run. This was the final World Series play-by-play assignment for Gowdy, who had been NBC's lead baseball announcer since 1966. Joe Garagiola would take over full-time as the network's main play-by-play voice for baseball the following season.\nDick Stockton.\nIn 1965, he began his sportscasting career at local radio and television stations in Philadelphia. He became sports director at KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh in 1967, and moved to WBZ-TV and WBZ radio in Boston in 1971. Three years later, he began calling Boston Celtics telecasts for WBZ, and the following year he became the lead announcer for Boston Red Sox games on WSBK-TV. Stockton was part of the broadcast crew for NBC Sports' coverage of the 1975 World Series, and on television called Carlton Fisk's famous, game-winning home run in Game 6 of that series as follows:\nThere it goes! A long drive. . . . if it stays fair. . . . home run!\nStockton stayed silent as Fisk rounded the bases, waiting until he made his way into the Red Sox dugout before proclaiming: \"We will have a seventh game in this 1975 World Series.\"\nLesley Visser and Stockton met at the sixth game of the 1975 World Series, where Stockton called Fisk's home run for NBC and Visser was covering the game for \"The Boston Globe\". Since July 2011, she has been married to businessman and former Harvard basketball captain Bob Kanuth.\nAftermath.\nThe homer arguably changed the way televised sports are covered; because camera operators missed a cue from the producer, the camera lingered on Fisk trying to \"wave his home run fair.\" This image of Fisk proved so dramatic that \"reaction shots\" became standard fare in sports broadcasting.\nThe Red Sox lost Game 7 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead on a RBI single by Carl Yastrzemski. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman Tony Pérez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning on Joe Morgan's RBI bloop single. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\" With a .370 batting average,10 hits, 2 runs batted in, Cincinnati third baseman Pete Rose was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. The Game 7 victory gave the Reds their first championship in 35 years. The Reds have not lost a World Series game since Carlton Fisk's home run, a span of nine straight wins.\nIn 2003, ESPN ranked it the second-greatest World Series ever played, trailing only the series, while in 2020, Sam Miller of ESPN named it the best World Series ever.\nAfter the 1975 World Series, the Red Sox were in a financial dilemma. The Red Sox had to sign prospective free agents Lynn, Carlton Fisk, and Rick Burleson. The Red Sox were explaining that they couldn't afford Lynn, Burleson, and Fisk. To make matters worse, the Red Sox were about to buy Rollie Fingers and Joe Rudi from the Oakland A's. Many fans wondered how Boston could afford to sign Fingers and Rudi if they did not have the money to sign the three players that led them to the 1975 World Series. However, commissioner Bowie Kuhn stepped in and vetoed the deal, thus allowing Boston to re-sign Lynn, Fisk, and Burleson.\nThe 1976 Red Sox never got on track under Darrell Johnson, who was replaced by Don Zimmer as manager on July 19. He led them to a winning record, but a disappointing third-place finish in the AL East with only 83 wins. The Red Sox would win more than 90 games in each of Zimmer's three full seasons (1977–1979) as manager, only the second time they had pulled off this feat since World War I. His 1978 team won 99 games, still the fourth-best record in franchise history.\nIn , the Reds won the NL West by ten games over the archrival Dodgers. They went undefeated in the postseason, sweeping the Philadelphia Phillies (winning Game 3 in their final at-bat) to return to the World Series. They continued to dominate by sweeping the Yankees in the newly renovated Yankee Stadium, the first World Series games played in Yankee Stadium since 1964. This was only the second ever sweep of the proud Yankees in the World Series. In winning the Series, the Reds became the first NL team since the 1921–22 New York Giants to win back-to-back World Series championships.\nFisk was among the top offensive catchers in the American League in his eight full seasons with the Boston Red Sox. His best year in Boston was in 1977, when he hit .315 with 26 home runs and 102 runs batted in.\nFacing the rival New York Yankees in the 1978 AL East Playoff, Fisk went 1-for-3 with a single in Boston's 5–4 loss to the Yankees. Some fans attributed Boston's 1978 loss to a rib injury sustained by Fisk. The same injury left Fisk on the sidelines for several games during the 1979 season, a year in which his primary position was designated hitter.\nFisk was reportedly among a group of several Red Sox players who lobbied Boston management for players to be paid what they deserved, which made him none too popular with Haywood Sullivan, the Boston general manager. When Fisk's contract expired at the end of the 1980 season, Sullivan in fact mailed him a new contract, but put it in the mail one day after the contractual deadline. As a result, Fisk was technically a free agent and he signed a $3.5 million deal with the Chicago White Sox, beginning with the 1981 season.\nIn 11 years with the Boston Red Sox, Fisk was selected to seven All-Star games, and batted .284 with 161 home runs and 568 RBI. He nearly had more RBIs than strikeouts, striking out only 588 times in 4353 plate appearances with the Red Sox, with an OBP of .356.\nThe \"Fisk Foul Pole\".\nOn June 13, 2005, the Red Sox honored Carlton Fisk and the 12th-inning home run that won Game 6 of the 1975 World Series by naming the left field foul pole, which the famous home run contacted, the \"Fisk Foul Pole\". In a pregame ceremony from the Monster Seats, Fisk was cheered by the Fenway Park crowd while the shot was replayed to the strains of Handel's \"Hallelujah Chorus\", the song longtime Fenway Park organist John Kiley originally played following the home run. The Red Sox scheduled the ceremony to coincide with an interleague series against the Cincinnati Reds, who were making their first trip back to Fenway Park since the '75 Series.\nThirty years later, the video of Fisk trying to wave the ball fair remains one of the game's enduring images. The crowd remembered that magical moment at precisely 12:34 am. ET early on the morning of October 22, 1975, when Fisk drove a 1–0 fastball from Cincinnati right-hander Pat Darcy high into the air, heading down the left-field line. \"The ball only took about two and half seconds\", recalled Fisk. \"It seemed like I was jumping and waving for more than two and a half seconds.\" Two and a half seconds later, the ball caromed off the bright yellow pole, ending one of the most dramatic World Series games ever played and giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win over the Reds in 12 hard-fought innings.\nOn the field, Fisk threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his former batterymate Luis Tiant. From now on, like the Pesky Pole down the right-field line, the left-field pole will officially be called the \"Fisk Foul Pole\". The idea was the inspiration of the countless fans who contacted the Red Sox about recognizing the historic moment. Fenway's right field foul pole, which is just from the plate, is named Pesky's Pole for former Red Sox shortstop Johnny Pesky. Mel Parnell named the pole after Pesky in when he won a game with a home run just inside the right-field pole.\nOn October 19, 2020, Thomas Boswell announced in his \"Washington Post\" column that he would not be covering the World Series for the first time since 1975. The 72-year-old Boswell cited health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that it was too risky for someone at his age to make the trip. Boswell pointed out in his column that at the time, the 1975 World Series was considered the greatest World Series ever played, largely due to the dramatic game six that ended with Carlton Fisk's historic home run. The drama of the series convinced him to remain a journalist with the \"Post\" and, in his column, he speculates \"Where would I be today if Fisk’s ball had gone foul?\""

Out of the 33 participants, 25 players were drafted.\nDraft selections.\n\"This table only shows the first twenty picks.\"\nPlayers.\nKorean-language basketball-centered magazine \"Rookie\" and newspaper \"Sports Dong-a\" have both retrospectively dubbed the 2007 draft as the \"Golden Draft\". Players from this draft include two winners of the KBL Most Valuable Player Award, members of the team which won gold at the 2014 Asian Games and several \"one-club men\" (active or retired players who spent their entire playing careers with the same team). Compared to past and present draft classes, as of the 2020–21 season, more players from this draft have continued to play regularly in their respective teams and maintained their professional careers into their mid-thirties. The 2021–22 playoffs featured Yang Hee-jong, Jung Young-sam and Ham Ji-hoon, all of whom were still with their original teams.\nHam won the KBL Most Valuable Player Award in 2010. As the last pick of the first round (10th overall), he is the lowest-ranked draft pick to have won the award.\nTwo players from the draft were much older than the others: Park Sang-oh and Lee Dong-jun. Park previously played for Chung-Ang University's basketball team but left the sport and then completed his mandatory military service before returning to basketball. Lee became a South Korean citizen and thus qualified for the rookie draft (despite having professional experience in Europe) instead of the ethnic draft."

        "text": "Nicholas Bucci Sr. (February 10, 1932 – February 8, 2019) was an American football back. He was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame for his play at Claymont High School, where he was the first \"Delaware Athlete of the Year\" after leading the state with 149 points in 1949. He later played college football for Florida and Delaware before spending three years with the Marcus Hook Athletic Association of the Wilmington Football League, winning two championships.\nEarly life and high school.\nBucci was born on February 10, 1932, in Wilmington, Delaware, to James and Anna Bucci (diGiorgio). He attended Claymont High School, where he played football, basketball, baseball, and track, earning a total of 14 varsity letters.\nBucci was named to the \"Journal-Every Evening\" all-state football team twice in his career, and was the first two-time selection. His coach described him as \"the best running back I ever had,\" and Claymont's \"best blocker, one of our best tacklers, our best passer, and a fair punter.\" As a senior, he helped the team compile an undefeated record, scoring 149 of their 250 points (including 23 touchdowns) and leading the state in scoring. For this, he was named the first \"Delaware Athlete of the Year,\" but did not receive the award due to rules of the Delaware Association of School Administrators which declared that high school athletes are ineligible to receive the award.\nCollege and semi-professional career.\nAfter receiving offers from Florida, Cornell, Delaware, North Carolina, Penn State, and Yale, Bucci accepted a scholarship from the University of Florida in 1950. He played on their freshman football team that year, but \"got homesick,\" and returned to his home state of Delaware in 1951. He then enrolled at the University of Delaware, playing part of one season before leaving the school.\nAfter leaving the University of Delaware, Bucci joined the independent Marcus Hook Athletic Association in October 1951. He returned to the team for their 1952 season, as a member of the Wilmington Football League, and helped them achieve an undefeated 7–0 record and the league championship title. He also played for their 1953 championship team before being sent to the United States Navy.\nLater life and death.\nAfter serving three years in the Navy, Bucci worked for the Phoenix Steel Corporation for 36 years, and later at Sears and in the Philadelphia Phillies security. He also worked for the New Castle County crossing guards until his retirement at the age of 80.\nWith his wife, Tina, Bucci had three children. His only son, Nick Jr., was described as the \"direct opposite\" of Nick Sr., never playing sports and instead being a musician.\nBucci was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame in 2004.\nBucci died on February 8, 2019, at the age of 86 in the Wilmington Hospital. It was two days before what would have been his 87th birthday."

        "text": "The 1999–2000 North Dakota Fighting Sioux men's ice hockey season was the 58th season of play for the program. They represented the University of North Dakota in the 1999–2000 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 49th season in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The Fighting Sioux were coached by Dean Blais, in his 6th season, and played their home games at Ralph Engelstad Arena.\nSeason.\nAfter getting knocked out in the first round of the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back years, North Dakota was chomping at the bit for another chance to prove themselves. Led by Peter Armbrust, Lee Goren and Jason Ulmer, three seniors who had won a national championship as freshmen, the Fighting Sioux entered the season as one of the favorites to compete for a championship.\nEarly success.\nRelying heavily on junior netminder, Karl Goehring, the team began their season with an almost flawless start. After taking three out of four points on the road from long-time rival Minnesota, North Dakota travelled east and swept #7 Clarkson. While they got a fight in the second game, the win established the Sioux early on and they rose up to #1 in the polls in early-November.\nGoaltending battle.\nGoehring didn't drop a match until his 10th game of the season. While backup netminder Andy Kollar started the following game, that was due mostly to the weakness of the opposition. Goehring was back in net the very next contest but allowed 6 goals for the second consecutive game. Kollar was put in goal for the next four games and while his numbers weren't spectacular, UND won three of the matches. However, Kollar lost the starting job after a poor performance against Denver, one of the weaker teams in the conference. The two would continue to share the goal crease for the remainder of the season, though Goehring did retain the lion's share of the starts.\nUps and downs.\nAfter the loss to Denver, North Dakota flirted with the #1 ranking after winning the Badger Showdown. A couple of weeks later, however, Wisconsin got its revenge by sweeping the Fighting Sioux and establishing themselves atop the conference standings. UND could little afford to lose any of its remaining games if it wanted to continue as the regular season WCHA champion. A split with Minnesota the very next weekend put them in a precarious position while a near sweep at the hands of St. Cloud State all but ended their chances at a 4th-consecutive conference championship.\nFinishing strong.\nNorth Dakota righted the ship in February and rounded out the final four weeks of the regular season without a loss. In the team's 5–0 win over Michigan Tech, Karl Goehring set a new program record with his 5th shutout of the season. When the team entered the postseason, he had pushed the mark up to 6 and was one of the top goaltenders in the nation. Both he and Jeff Panzer were named as First Team All-Americans and UND entered the conference playoffs as the #2 team in the nation.\nWCHA tournament.\nNorth Dakota began their postseason run at home against Denver and, though their offense faltered in the second game, the Fighting Sioux were too much for the Pioneers to handle. Before the next round began, however, Goehring was diagnosed with a concussion and the team had to rely on Andy Kollar to take them the rest of the way. The sophomore held the fort and allowed North Dakota's offense to carry the team to victory, including a win over top-ranked Wisconsin in the WCHA championship game.\nNCAA tournament.\nNorth Dakota moved up to #2 in the polls but still remained behind Wisconsin. While that left the team as the #2 western seed, it did provide UND with a buy into the second round of the tournament. While Goehring was still sidelined, North Dakota received a gift when the lowest-seeded team, Niagara, pulled off an upset in the first round. UND dominated in the first and third periods to end their postseason losing streak and propel themselves into the Frozen Four.\nDespite Kollar's performance in Goehring's absence, as soon as their primary starter was cleared to play, head coach Dean Blais put Goehring back in net. Any worries about the move were banished in the national semifinal when Goehring earned his 8th shutout of the season, defeating defending champion Maine in the process. The win sent UND to the championship game with just Boston College remaining in their way. The two teams were evenly matched in the first period, with both scoring 1 goal on 13 shots. BC got a lead in the second period but afterwards the team started playing a more defensive style. Lee Goren tied the game early in the third period and both teams struggled to find chances thereafter. with less than 6 minutes left in regulation, Goren assisted on Jason Ulmer's go-ahead marker and then potted an empty net goal to seal the match and give North Dakota its seventh national championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Joe Carter's 1993 World Series home run",
        "text": "Joe Carter's 1993 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series on October 23, 1993 at SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In the bottom of the ninth inning Joe Carter hit a one-out, three-run walk-off home run off Philadelphia Phillies closer Mitch Williams to give the Toronto Blue Jays its second consecutive championship. \nThis was only the second time in Major League Baseball history that the World Series ended on a walk-off home run. The first time was in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, when Pittsburgh Pirates second baseman Bill Mazeroski hit a home run off New York Yankees pitcher Ralph Terry to win that game by a final score of 10–9. Carter's home run in 1993 however, was the only time in Major League Baseball history that a team hit a walk-off home run while trailing in the bottom of the ninth inning to win the World Series. \nRadio sportscaster Tom Cheek's call of \"Touch 'em all Joe, you'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!\" has gone down as one of the most iconic moments in Toronto sports history.\nBackground.\nAfter the 1992 season, the Blue Jays let World Series hero Dave Winfield and longtime closer Tom Henke go but signed two key free agents: designated hitter Paul Molitor from the Milwaukee Brewers and perennial playoff success Dave Stewart from the Oakland Athletics.\nIn 1993, the Blue Jays had seven All-Stars: outfielders Devon White and Joe Carter, infielders John Olerud and Roberto Alomar, designated hitter Molitor, plus starting pitcher Pat Hentgen, and closer Duane Ward. In August, the Jays acquired former nemesis Rickey Henderson from the Athletics. In the regular season, three Blue Jays—John Olerud, Paul Molitor and Roberto Alomar—finished 1-2-3 for the AL batting crown. The Blue Jays cruised to a 95–67 record, one less win than 1992 and seven games ahead of the New York Yankees, winning their third straight division title.\nThe 1993 Phillies were led by stars such as Darren Daulton, John Kruk, Lenny Dykstra, and Curt Schilling. The team was often described as \"shaggy\", \"unkempt\", and \"dirty.\" The previous year, noting the presence of the clean-cut Dale Murphy, Kruk himself described the team as \"24 morons and one Mormon\" (referring to Murphy). Their character endeared them to fans, and attendance reached a record high the following season. As a play on the legendary 1927 New York Yankees' Murderers' Row, the team's dirty, mullet-wearing look was dubbed \"Macho Row.\" To the surprise of many, the Phillies powered their way to a 97–65 record and an East division title, powered by the team's 17–5 record in April. Each game brought a new hero, and the season was filled with odd and extraordinary games. The 1993 Phillies team was also noted for the close bond between the players and coaching staff.\nThe Phillies' major contributors on offense were OF Lenny Dykstra, 1B John Kruk, SS Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and OF Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\nPostseason.\nThe Phillies beat the Atlanta Braves (the two-time defending National League champions) in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth pennant in franchise history. Mitch Williams struck out Bill Pecota to end Game 6 by the score of 6–3. Curt Schilling with an 1.69 ERA and 19 strikeouts was named the NLCS MVP. They faced the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series, who beat the Chicago White Sox 4 games to 2 in the American League Championship Series. \nWilliams earned a save in Game 2 of the series, relieving Terry Mulholland as the Phillies tied the series at a game each. However, Williams suffered the loss in Game 4, the highest-scoring game in World Series history, as the Blue Jays came back from a 14–9 deficit, scoring six times in the eighth inning to earn a 15–14 victory and take a 3–1 series lead. It remains the highest scoring game in World Series history. Afterwards, Williams received death threats from angry Phillies fans for blowing the game.\nAfter the Phillies won Game 5 in a complete-game shutout by Curt Schilling, the series returned to Toronto for Game 6.\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 6.\nThe sixth game in the series was a rematch between Game 2 starters Terry Mulholland and Dave Stewart, who would have similar results. Toronto opened up the scoring in the bottom of the first with a run-scoring Paul Molitor triple, Joe Carter sacrifice fly, and Roberto Alomar RBI single. Molitor added a solo home run in the 5th inning, bringing the score to 5–1 for Toronto.\nIn the 7th inning, Philadelphia fought back with five runs to take a 6–5 lead. Lenny Dykstra hit a three-run home run (his fourth home run in the World Series), Dave Hollins had an RBI single and Pete Incaviglia hit a sacrifice fly. The inning brought an end to Dave Stewart's night, leaving the game with 6 innings pitched and 4 runs given up.\nThe play.\nPhiladelphia closer Mitch Williams came on to the pitch the bottom of the 9th with Philadelphia clinging to a 6–5 lead. After beginning the inning by walking Rickey Henderson, Williams tried to counter Henderson's speed by pitching out of a slide-step style of pitching delivery. Prior to Game 6 of the 1993 World Series, Williams never used the slide-step delivery in his career. This may have cut back on the velocity of the hard throwing Williams. The walk to Henderson was followed by a Devon White fly out and a single by Paul Molitor. Joe Carter came up next and, on a two strike pitch, he hit an inside pitch just over the left field fence for a three-run walk-off home run, giving the Blue Jays a come-from-behind 8–6 victory, and the World Series crown. Upon hitting the home run, Carter jumped up and down many times, most notably while rounding first base, where his helmet came off. \nAftermath.\nThis was the last major North American professional sports championship won by a Canadian-based team until 2019, when the Toronto Raptors, a team that was formed in 1995, defeated the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors in a six-game NBA Finals.\nWilliams later placed the blame on himself for what happened in the 1993 World Series, adding that he had put the ordeal behind him:\nWilliams also said:\nIn 2011, 17 years after giving up the World Series home run, Williams said he regretted using the slide step when pitching to Carter. In a joint interview with Carter for the MLB Network's 20 Greatest Games series, Williams said he hadn't used the slide step before but was talked into doing so by pitching coach Johnny Podres after allowing a walk to base-stealing legend Rickey Henderson.\nDespite having the highest number of lefty saves in his career with the Phillies (102), the Carter blast was the end of the line for Williams in Philadelphia. The Phillies traded him to the Houston Astros prior to the start of the 1994 season. Williams' post-Phillies career was a comedown from his previous heights. He would register only two wins and six saves in his final three major league seasons, with an ERA of 6.75 or above in all three campaigns. After two months with Houston in 1994, Williams closed out his major league career with equally short stints with the California Angels in 1995 and the Kansas City Royals in 1997."

        "text": "PBA Tour Bowling 2001 is a 2000 bowling sports-based video game developed and published by Bethesda Softworks. The game is licensed by the Professional Bowlers Association.\nGameplay.\nThe game features 3D full-motion computer generated skeletal models with the likenesses of actual veteran and star professional PBA bowlers using motion captured movements, available as playable characters and AI opponents. This game was designed to help both novices and professionals improve their bowling skills by playing against the AI computer models. Players can create and customize their own bowlers and balls by features such as appearance, strike ball, and spare ball using an extensive \"Create-A-Bowler\" feature in the options menu. The physics model allows the bowler and ball to react and move as they would in real life, and while the players have full control over the spin, aim, and power of the ball, the bowler's technique affects the direction and effectiveness. The interface of the game uses a system that sets power, accuracy, and backspin variables.\nThe lanes are modeled after real PBA alleys, which will degrade as play continues over time, which will require players to adjust to the wear and tear. The game uses fly-by cameras to show several different camera angles including overhead or third-person, so players can study their technique using replays at different positions including execution and follow-through.\nThe game includes practice games, team games, tournaments, and versus modes, and supports single-player and multiplayer online games. The game supports multiplayer play over the Internet for up to four players, using GameSpy technology intended to allow players using either PC or Sega Dreamcast to compete against each other. Players on PC link up through LAN/TCP-IP support, while players on Dreamcast engage in online play via its 56k modem. Inclusion of network support allows players to track world rankings, championships, and more.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was announced in May 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast.The PC version of the game went gold in November 2000.\nReception.\nIGN rated the game a 5.6 out of 10 stating\"Granted, that's more than a certain predecessor can claim, but as the situation stands, it ain't a ballsy enough proposition to convince enthusiastic bowlers to part with their precious pesos\" "

        "text": "The 2022–23 Texas Longhorns women's basketball team represents the University of Texas at Austin in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The team is coached by Vic Schaefer entering his third season at Texas. The Longhorns are members of the Big 12 Conference and play their home games at the new Moody Center.\nThis will be the Longhorns' first season at the newly constructed Moody Center. Previously, Texas played at the Frank Erwin Center. This will be the first time the Longhorns have a new arena since 1977 when Texas moved from the Gregory Gymnasium to the Frank Erwin Center.\nPrevious season.\nRegular season.\nComing into the season, Texas had a lot of momentum going into the 2021–22 season after their Elite 8 appearance in the NCAA tournament the previous season. However, Texas lost star player Charli Collier to the WNBA draft, as she was the first overall pick by the Dallas Wings. With the addition of 2 5-star athletes in Rori Harmon and Aaliyah Moore and 2 4-star athletes in Latasha Lattimore and Kyndall Hunter, the momentum was still high. Texas finished the 2021-22 regular season 23–6, 13–5 in Big 12 play. The Longhorns finished 3rd in the Big 12 behind Iowa State and Baylor. 5-star recruit Rori Harmon emerged as a top freshman as she earned many accolades such as 4-time Big 12 Freshman of the Week, All-Big 12 Second Team, Big 12 All-Defensive Team, Big 12 All-Freshman Team, Big 12 Freshman of the Year, and Big 12 tournament Most Outstanding Player. Harmon also was the first freshman in Texas women’s basketball history to earn All-American Honors. The combination of younger talent with freshmen Rori Harmon and Aaliyah Moore, plus sophomore DeYona Gaston, with the older talent of seniors Joanne Allen-Taylor, Lauren Ebo, Audrey Warren, and junior three point leader Aliyah Matharu, Texas had their most success since the 2017-18 season where the Longhorns went 24–5 during the regular season.\nBig 12 tournament.\nTexas earned a 3-seed in the 2022 Big 12 Conference women's basketball tournament where they would square off against 6-seed Kansas State. Texas would go on to defeat Kansas State 72–65 to advance to the second round. In the second round, the Longhorns faced off against Iowa State. Coming into the game, Texas had swept the Cyclones during the regular season. Texas would go on to win 82–73 in overtime behind Rori Harmon’s 30-point career high performance, advancing them to the championship game against Baylor.\nComing into the game, Texas was riding a 13 game losing streak to Baylor, having not defeated the Bears since the 2016-17 season. The Longhorns would go on to snap the losing streak defeating Baylor 67–58 in the championship game.\nNCAA tournament.\nTexas entered the NCAA tournament as a 2-seed where they faced off against 15-seed Fairfield. The Longhorns would go on to defeat the Stags 70–52, advancing Texas to the round of 32. In the round of 32, Texas played against 7-seed Utah. Texas defeated the Utes 78–56 sending them to the sweet 16 to match up with Ohio State. Against the Buckeyes, Texas won 66–63 advance Texas to their second consecutive elite 8. In the elite 8, the Longhorns faced Stanford, who they beat earlier in the regular season. However, Stanford prevailed against Texas, winning the game 59–50.\nPreseason.\nBig 12 Media Poll.\nSource:\nPreseason All-Big 12 teams.\nSource:\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition \n!colspan=9 style=|Non-Conference Regular Season \n!colspan=12 style=| Big 12 Regular Season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big 12 Tournament (2–1)\n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA Tournament\nSource:Schedule\nAwards and honors.\nSource:"

        "title": "Bill Brown (boxing)",
        "text": "William J. Brown (January 20, 1874 – September 3, 1943) was an American boxing commissioner, referee, and promoter.\nEarly life.\nBrown was born on January 20, 1874, in County Cork, Ireland. He and his widowed mother arrived in the United States on March 11, 1888, and took up residence in New York City. Brown spent his first years in the U.S. working as a delivery boy and truck driver. He also spent time at the Pastime Athletic Club, where George Bothner taught him to wrestle. In 1894 John Woods hired Brown to work as a wrestling instructor at his gym.\nBoxing.\nPromoter.\nBrown first became acquainted with boxing at Wood's gym and eventually trained boxers in addition to wrestlers. The gym closed in 1904 in order to make way for the Prince George Hotel. Brown then opened his own gym in Chelsea, Manhattan and began hosting fights. His success as a boxing promoter allowed him to purchase Pine Hill Farm, a health retreat and farm overlooking the Hudson River in Garrison, New York, in 1909. Brown's Gymnasium closed in 1917 when boxing was outlawed in the state.\nReferee.\nBrown also served as a boxing referee. His notable fights included Jim Coffey vs. Frank Moran, Fred Fulton vs. Al Reich, and Benny Leonard vs. Eddie Fitzsimmons. In 1920, the boxing commission implemented a plan to rotate referees and Brown, who preferred to choose his own assignments, resigned. In 1921 he turned down the opportunity to serve as the referee for the Jack Dempsey vs. Georges Carpentier fight due to a previous disagreement with promoter Tex Rickard.\nNew York State Athletic Commission.\nIn 1933, Brown was appointed to the New York State Athletic Commission. In 1934, Brown objected to allowing the Max Baer-Primo Carnera fight to take place, as he did not believe that Baer was in good enough condition to fight. He was overruled by his fellow commissioners John J. Phelan and D. Walker Wear. Baer ended up defeating Carnera by technical knockout. In 1935, Brown and Phelan ordered a reversal of the decision in the Vince Dundee–Eddie Risko fight. The fight was originally declared a victory for Sisko, with Judge Sidney Scharlin and referee Jed Gahan voting in favor of Sisko and the other judge, Jack Britton, voting in favor of Dundee. Phelan, who was sitting at ringside, immediately performed an inspection of the ballots and found that Britton gave seven to Dundee and three to Risko and Scharlin scored five rounds for Dundee with four to Risko. Phelan, Brown, and Scharlin conferred and the decision was reversed in favor of Dundee. Later that year, Brown objected to a proposed fight between Carnera and Ray Impelletiere on the grounds that Impelletiere was not experienced enough to fight Carnera, but was overruled by the other two commissioners. In 1936, Brown and Phelan voted to cancel a bout between Hank Bath and Red Burman after they received a telegram from the secretary of the California State Athletic Commission reporting that two of Bath's fights in that state were \"questionable\". In February 1938, the commission suspended the licenses of manager Joe Jacobs and boxer Tony Galento for Galento's failure to fight Harry Thomas. Galento's license was restored within a few months, however the commission refused to license Jacobs for the Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling rematch later that year. In 1939 Brown and Phelan sued boxing promoter James J. Johnston for libel over Johnston's allegations that the two commissioners had a financial interest in the Twentieth Century Sporting Club. The suit ended when Johnston made a statement denying that he had used the word \"financial\" and added that he never meant to accuse Brown and Phelan of \"malfeasance or misfeasance of any kind\". In 1940 the commission voted to fine and suspend Al Davis after his disqualification loss to Fritzie Zivic, with Brown stating that although the commission did not have the power to suspend a boxer for life, Davis would be suspended “for the life of the commission”. The commission reinstated Davis the following year for his rematch against Zivic. Brown retired from the commission on January 1, 1943, in order to focus on his farm. He died on September 3, 1943, at his farm in Garrison. He was buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of George Washington (Newark)",
        "text": "George Washington is an outdoor equestrian statue by the Scottish-American sculptor J. Massey Rhind located in Washington Park in Newark, New Jersey. It depicts General George Washington saying farewell to the troops of the Continental Army on November 2, 1783, and was dedicated on the anniversary of that event in 1912.\nHistory.\nSculptor J. Massey Rhind was commissioned to do the work, funded by the bequest of Amos H. Van Horn (1840–1908), owner of one of the largest furniture stores in Newark. Born in Edinburgh, Rhind (1860–1936) had a workshop in New York City and was known for the classical caryatids at Macy's Department Store on 34th Street. Rhind's proposal was for a distinctive equestrian statue, showing General Washington saying farewell to the troops and standing beside, rather than mounted on, his horse, which helped secure the commission. The statue was cast in 1912 by the Roman Bronze Works of New York City, which had also done the casting of Rhind's sculptures for the Stephenson Grand Army of the Republic Memorial in Washington, D.C. \"George Washington\" was installed in Newark's Washington Park and dedicated on November 2, 1912, the anniversary of the event depicted. President William H. Taft was scheduled to deliver an address at the dedication, but then had to attend the funeral of vice-president James S. Sherman, who had died three days earlier, on October 30.\nDescription.\nThe bronze sculpture depicts General Washington saying his farewell address to the troops of the Continental Army at Rocky Hill, New Jersey, on November 2, 1783. This event was after word of the peace treaty ending the American Revolutionary War had arrived from Paris. The statue shows Washington, dismounted from his horse, in military uniform, and with a riding cloak over his shoulder. His horse is shown with a raised foot and lowered head. The statue measures approximately high x wide x long and is on a stone base that measures approximately high x wide x long.\nLegacy.\nAfter its dedication in 1912, brewery mogul Christian William Feigenspan commissioned Rhind for a copy of the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice. The statue was dedicated in Newark's Clinton Park (now Lincoln Park) on July 28, 1916.\nThe Washington statue was added to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property of the James Street Commons Historic District on January 9, 1978. It was surveyed by the Save Outdoor Sculpture program of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 1995."

        "title": "Joseph Stubbs (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Joseph Stubbs (April 28, 1899 – February 6, 1962) was an American ice hockey player and coach for Harvard who was active in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s.\nCareer.\nStubbs began attending Harvard University in 1916 and was a member of the freshman hockey team. Due to the United States' entry into World War I, Harvard suspended its varsity ice hockey team the following year, but Stubbs joined the informal team that was put together by the remaining undergraduates. After the program was restarted following the end of the war, Stubbs was busy with his studies and did not participate. For his senior season, however, Stubbs finally joined the team and helped the team win 10 consecutive games to capture the Intercollegiate Championship in 1920.\nAfter graduating, Stubbs briefly played amateur hockey with the Boston Athletic Association before retiring as a player. He returned to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 1925 and worked primarily with the defense. After helping Harvard win back-to-back Eastern Intercollegiate Championships, Stubbs was promoted to head coach after the resignation of Edward Bigelow. Stubbs had big shoes to fill but he got off to a good start, leading Harvard to a 7–2 record in his first season. The team declined a bit in his second season but did manage to hand Yale its only loss on the year. In his third season, Stubbs led Harvard through some ups and downs but had his team in contention for the intercollegiate title when they met Yale at season's end. The two finished tied with a record of 1–1–1 after three games, including an epic three overtime game. While both teams immediately drew up plans for a fourth match to decide the championship, Harvard's athletic director, W. J. Bingham, decided to end the team's season. While the ending didn't please anyone, it did give Harvard a (shared) intercollegiate championship.\nIn 1931, Stubbs had Harvard looking as good as they ever had. The team ran through all of its competition, posting 5 shutouts and allowing just 10 goals in 11 games. The Crimson entered their best-of-three series with Yale as a narrow favorite but were stunned by the powerful Elis; Harvard surrendered 8 goals in two games, while scoring just 2 for themselves. After the disappointing finish, Harvard began the following season with a near repeat performance, entering the Yale series with a 10–1 record. Stubbs' team drew first blood, capturing the first game 4–1, and then held off the rabid Bulldogs with two ties, both going into double overtime. The season ended with Harvard on top of all eastern teams by itself, earning Stubbs his first outright championship.\nAfter repeating as champions in 1933, Harvard took a sharp decline and posted its worst season in almost 40 years. The Crimson rebounded quickly, however, and Stubbs had the team back on the winning side of the ledger in 1935. He got Harvard to win a second pair of Championships in '36 (shared) and '37, losing only to McGill in the later. Just like after the earlier double feat, Harvard posted a losing record in 1938. This time, however, Stubbs wouldn't be around to rebuild the program. After eleven seasons behind the bench and five championships, Stubbs resigned as head coach.\nHarvard would eventually choose Clark Hodder as Stubbs' successor but the era of Harvard as the premier college program was over. After Stubbs stepped down, it would be more than 50 years before the Crimson would win another ice hockey championship."

        "text": "The 2020-21 season was Ulster's 27th season since the advent of professionalism in rugby union, and Dan McFarland's third season as head coach. Iain Henderson was captain. They competed in the Pro14, the Pro14 Rainbow Cup, the European Rugby Champions Cup and the European Rugby Challenge Cup.\nThe Pro14 season was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the two South African teams unable to compete and the playoffs reduced to a final between the winners of the two conferences. Ulster finished second in Conference A, qualifying for next season's Champion's Cup. Scrum-half John Cooney was the league's leading scorer with 115 points. Number eight Marcell Coetzee was joint top try scorer with nine, and was named Players' Player of the Season. Ulster led the league in lineouts and scrums. Cooney and Coetzee made the Pro14 Dream Team, as did fullback Michael Lowry and loosehead prop Eric O'Sullivan.\nThe pool stage of the Champions Cup was reduced to two matches by the pandemic. Ulster lost both and failed to progress to the knockout stage, but were entered into the Challenge Cup, making the semi-finals where they lost to Leicester Tigers. The Pro14 regular season was followed by the Pro14 Rainbow Cup, played between the winners of a European pool and the winners of a pool containing the four ex-Super Rugby South African teams. Ulster finished tenth of twelve in the European pool, and led the competition in scrums.\nJohn Cooney was Ulster's leading scorer with 174 points. Marcell Coetzee was leading try scorer with nine. Lock Alan O'Connor was leading tackler with 242, and was named Ulster's Player of the Year. This was Coetzee's last season with Ulster: he left in April to join the Bulls. Attack coach Dwayne Peel left at the end of the season to become head coach of Scarlets.\nEvents.\nPersonnel changes.\nNew arrivals were scrum-half Alby Mathewson, formerly of Munster, and out-half Ian Madigan from Bristol Bears, although due to the delays caused by Covid-19, both had actually made their debuts and the end of the previous season. Academy centre Stewart Moore joined the senior squad on a development contract. Hooker Bradley Roberts was signed from Rainey Old Boys as short-term injury cover, and ended up being kept on permanently.\nWing Angus Kernohan departed for Ealing Trailfinders, hooker Zack McCall, prop Tommy O'Hagan and flanker Clive Ross were released. Five new players joined the academy, including three from Wallace High School - flanker Reuben Crothers, centre Ben Carson and scrum-half Nathan Doak - as well as Down High School scrum-half Lewis Finlay and Ireland Sevens lock Cormac Izuchukwu.\nPre-season.\nDue to the mid-season break during the 2019–20 season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020–21 season started later than usual. The two South African teams, the Cheetahs and Southern Kings, would not take part.\nThe EPCR agreed a new format for the 2020–21 European Rugby Champions Cup in response to COVID-19: the top eight eligible teams from the Pro14, the Gallagher Premiership and Top 14 competed in a 24-team tournament divided into two pools of twelve teams, with each team playing four games in the pool stage - two at home and two away.\nFirst block.\nThe Pro14 season started on 2 October. Ulster started the season with five straight victories.\nAutumn internationals.\nThe Ireland team for the Autumn Nations Cup was announced on 5 November, and included five Ulster players, Iain Henderson, Rob Herring, Billy Burns, Stuart McCloskey and Jacob Stockdale. Burns made his international debut against Wales.

The 1902 Baton Rouge Cajuns began play as charter members of the Class D level Cotton States League. In 1903, the team changed its moniker to the Baton Rouge \"Red Sticks,\" a translation of the city's French name into English, and captured the 1903 Cotton League Championship. \nOn July 13, 1904, Red Sticks pitcher Hanlan threw a no–hitter against the Pine Bluff Lumbermen, winning 2–0 in six innings. In 1905–1906, the Cajuns' moniker reappeared as the team remained in the Cotton States League. On July 4, 1905, Baton Rouge pitcher Moxie Maxwell pitched a no-hitter in a 2–1 loss to the Vicksburg Hill Climbers. Another no-hitter was thrown on August 5, 1906, when Jimmy Laird no-hit the Jackson Senators in a 3–0 Baton Rough victory.

Lafayette teams played as members of the 1907 Gulf Coast League 1920 Louisiana State League and Evangeline League (1934–1942, 1948–1957). Lafayette teams won four league championships and one pennant in the era. The early Lafayette teams preceded the 1975 and 1976 Lafayette Drillers, who played as members of the Texas League and the 1998 to 2000 Bayou Bullfrogs of the Texas-Louisiana League.\nLafayette teams played as minor league affiliates of the St. Louis Browns from 1936 to 1941, Chicago Cubs from 1955 to 1957 and San Francisco Giants in 1975 and 1976.\nHistory.\nIn 1907, minor League baseball began in Lafayette.

On June 20, 1957, the team disbanded.\nThe Evangeline League permanently folded following the 1957 season and had never become an integrated league, despite the efforts of major league affiliates (the Chicago Cubs) to assign players to the Lafayette Oilers and integrate team rosters. In 1956, some boycotts of attending games occurred after the Lafayette Oilers refused to accept the players and Lafayette Parrish, home of the Baton Rouge Rebels, passed legislation making it illegal for black players to play in its ballparks. The Evangeline League itself also officially banned non-white players from appearing on their rosters. These blocks forced the major league teams to reassign the players to other leagues. Due to boycotts, the 1956 playoff finals, featuring Lafayette, were cancelled. Both the Lafayette Oilers and the Baton Rouge Rebels folded before the end of the 1957 season, on June 20 1957.\nMinor league baseball returned to Lafayette, Louisiana in 1975.

The 1925 Ardmore Boomers finished 86–64 and defeated the Muskogee Athletics 4–1 in the league finals to capture the 1925 Western Association Championship. In 1926 however, the franchise moved to Joplin, Missouri on July 14, 1926, to become the Joplin Ozarks. There the team lost in the league finals.\nArdmore remained without professional baseball until 1947. The Ardmore Indians (1947–1952) began play in the newly formed Sooner State League in 1947, with fellow founding members Ada Herefords, Duncan Cementers, Lawton Giants, McAlester Rockets and Seminole Oilers.\nThe \"Indians\" moniker came from Ardmore being an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians in 1947 and 1948. In their first season, the Indians made the 1947 league finals, but were defeated by the McAlester rockets 4 games to 1. Finishing 75–65 in 1950, the Indians reached the league finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by McAlester.

        "text": "The 2022 UK Championship (officially the 2022 Cazoo UK Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 12 to 20 November 2022 at the York Barbican in York, England. The fifth ranking event and first Triple Crown event of the 2022–23 snooker season, the tournament was the 46th edition of the UK Championship, which was first held in 1977. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by car retail company Cazoo, the event was broadcast domestically by the BBC and Eurosport. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize fund of £1,205,000.\nThe tournament organisers changed the format for the 2022 event, replacing the flat-128 draw that had been used from 2013 to 2021 with a format that closely resembled that of the World Snooker Championship. The top 16 players in the world rankings were seeded through to the last-32 stage, where they were joined by 16 qualifiers from a 128-player qualifying tournament that took place from 5 to 10 November at Ponds Forge in Sheffield. Aged 60, Jimmy White became the oldest player to qualify for the tournament's final stages since 63-year-old Eddie Charlton in 1993.\nThe defending champion was Zhao Xintong, who defeated Luca Brecel 10–5 in the final of the 2021 event. Zhao lost in the first round to Sam Craigie. Mark Allen reached his third UK Championship final, having been runner-up in 2011 and 2018, where he faced three-time winner Ding Junhui, who reached his first ranking final in three years. Allen trailed in every match he played in the tournament, and fell 1–6 behind in the final, but he won nine of the last ten frames to clinch a 10–7 victory. He became the second Northern Irish player to win the UK Championship, after Alex Higgins in 1983; his comeback from 1–6 behind saw him overcome the largest deficit in a UK Championship final since Higgins came from 0–7 behind to defeat Steve Davis 16–15 in that year. It was Allen's eighth ranking title and second Triple Crown title, following his win at the 2018 Masters. Cao Yupeng made the tournament's highest break of 144 in his second-round qualifying match against Callum Beresford.\nFormat.\nThe 2022 UK Championship was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 12 to 20 November at the York Barbican in York, England. The fifth ranking event and first Triple Crown tournament of the 2022–23 snooker season, the tournament was the 46th edition of the UK Championship, which was first held in 1977 as the United Kingdom Professional Snooker Championship. For the tournament's first seven years, only UK residents or passport holders were eligible to compete. At the 1984 event, the UK Championship became a ranking tournament open to players of any nationality, which has remained the case since. \nFor the 2022 event, a format similar to the World Championship replaced the flat-128 draw that had been used for the preceding nine years from 2013 to 2021. The top 16 players in the snooker world rankings were seeded through to the round of 32. An additional 128 players—comprising professionals ranked outside the top 16, leading amateur players from the WPBSA's Q Tour and other amateur events, and top-performing junior players from the UK—competed in a four-round qualifying tournament from 5 to 10 November at Ponds Forge in Sheffield, with higher ranked players given byes to the later rounds. The 16 successful qualifiers advanced to the round of 32 in York, where they were drawn at random against the top 16 seeds. The qualifying rounds were broadcast on Discovery+ as well as on the World Snooker Tour's Facebook and YouTube channels. \nAll matches before the final were played as the best of 11 frames. The final was played as the best of 19 frames. Due to the revised format, the venue in York featured two tables at the outset, rather than the eight tables used in preceding years. The main stages of the event were broadcast in the UK by the BBC and Eurosport, and in Europe by Discovery+ and Eurosport. Other international broadcasters included Kuaishou, Huya Live, Youku, and CCTV in China; NowTV in Hong Kong; and DAZN in Canada, the United States, and Brazil. In territories where there was no other coverage, the event was broadcast by Matchroom Sport. The defending champion was China's Zhao Xintong, who won his maiden ranking title at the previous year's event, defeating Belgium's Luca Brecel 10–5 in the final.\nPrize fund.\nThe event featured a total prize fund of £1,205,000, up from £1,009,000 the previous year, with the winner receiving £250,000, up from £200,000 the previous year. The tournament was sponsored by British car retailer Cazoo. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nQualifying rounds.\nQualifying took place from 5 to 10 November at Ponds Forge in Sheffield. Five-time UK champion Stephen Hendry withdrew from the tournament because the qualifying schedule conflicted with his obligations at the 2022 Champion of Champions, where he was working as a commentator and pundit for ITV.

Aged 60, White became the oldest player to qualify for the tournament's final stages since 63-year-old Eddie Charlton in 1993.

It's brilliant to see Ding play like that and I wish he played like that more because he's so good for the game\". \nFacing Perry, Ford made breaks of 103 and 62 to win the first two frames, before Perry made a 70 break to take the third. In frame four, Perry led by 28 points but missed the penultimate red; Ford made a 41 clearance to take a 3–1 lead at the mid-session interval. Perry won two consecutive frames with breaks of 101 and 66 to draw level at 3–3, but Ford made an 86 break to win the seventh. Perry required a snooker on the green in the eighth and succeeded in getting it, but then missed a pot on the green to a middle pocket; Ford won the frame to go 5–3 ahead. Ford missed the last red in the ninth while leading by 26 points and Perry won the frame with a clearance. However, Ford wrapped up a 6–4 win in frame ten, helped by a break of 52, to reach the second UK Championship semi-final of his career.\nLisowski began his match against Murphy with a 67 break before missing a blue to the middle pocket, which gave Murphy the chance to make a 67 clearance and force a re-spotted black. Lisowski potted the black for a 1–0 lead and went on to make a record-equalling four consecutive century breaks of 105, 127, 123, and 100 as he extended his lead to 5–0. Lisowski became the eighth player—the others being Neil Robertson, John Higgins, Gary Wilson, Allen, Murphy, Maguire, and Lu Ning—to make four consecutive centuries in professional competition. Murphy made a 111 century in frame six and led in frame seven, but declared a push shot foul on himself that allowed Lisowski to wrap up a 6–1 victory and reach the semi-finals of a Triple Crown event for the first time. Murphy commented on Lisowski's performance: \"Every time I made a small mistake, I had to sit down and admire the wondrous talent pouring out of this young man that we have seen coming for a long time\".\nCraigie won the first frame against Allen with a break of 74, but Allen won the next two, making a 105 break in the third. In the fourth frame, Allen succeeded in getting the snooker he required on the final pink, but Craigie potted the pink to tie the scores at 2–2 at the mid-session interval. When play resumed, Craigie took a 4–2 lead with breaks of 84 and 104, but Allen won three frames in a row with breaks of 50, 108, and 92 to lead 5–4. Allen won the match 6–4 in the tenth frame to reach the semi-finals for a fifth time. \"I wasn’t timing the ball well tonight but I hung in there. I was really good mentally, thinking good thoughts\", commented Allen after the match.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 19 November. Two top-16 seeds (Allen and Lisowski) and two qualifiers (Ding and Ford) reached this stage, with world number nine Allen the highest-ranked player among the semi-finalists. Ding won the first frame against Ford after he snookered his opponent behind the yellow with two reds remaining and then cleared the table. Ding won frame two with a 55 break, and took advantage of positional errors and missed pots by Ford to win the third. An 84 break gave Ding a 4–0 lead at the mid-session interval. When play resumed, Ford was on a 46 break before missing the pink; Ding responded to make a 62 clearance and lead 5–0. However, Ford came back with breaks of 77, 64, and 64 to win the next three frames and trail 3–5. Ford attempted a maximum break in the ninth frame, potting eight reds and eight blacks, but missed the ninth red, giving Ding the opportunity to make a 37 break. Ford then played a poor safety shot that left one of the two remaining reds over the middle pocket, allowing Ding to wrap up a 6–3 victory. \nLisowski won the first two frames against Allen, making a 58 break in the first and a 77 break in the second. The third frame hinged on a safety battle on the last red; Allen eventually potted the red and cleared to win the frame. Allen made a 63 break in the fourth frame to tie the scores at 2–2 at the mid-session interval. Lisowski won the fifth after Allen missed a shot on the black. Lisowski required a snooker on the yellow in the sixth, which he successfully obtained, only to make a safety error that gave Allen an opportunity to pot the yellow and tie the scores again at 3–3. Lisowski took the seventh frame with the help of a 54 break, and won the eighth after a safety battle on the last two reds, taking a 5–3 lead. In the ninth, Allen potted a four-ball plant and made a 115 break, the only century of the match, to reduce Lisowski's lead to 5–4. Allen then made a 74 break in the tenth after Lisowski missed a long red, forcing a deciding frame. Allen had the first chance in the decider and made a break of 36 before running out of position; Lisowski responded with 57 before failing to get position on the last red. After tactical battles on the last red and the yellow, Lisowski potted the yellow but missed the green. It was Lisowski's last shot of the match as Allen cleared from the green to win the match 6–5 on the final black ball. \"Throughout the match I felt I got the better of the safety battles so when it came down to the last red in the decider, I felt I would get a chance\", said Allen afterwards. However, he added that \"[Lisowski] was the better player tonight and probably deserved to win\".\nFinal.\nThe final was played over two sessions on 20 November as a best-of-19-frame match between world number nine Allen and world number 38 Ding. Allen competed in his third UK Championship final, having been runner-up to Trump in 2011 and to O'Sullivan in 2018. Ding contested his fourth UK final, having won the title on three previous occasions, in 2005, 2009, and 2019. It was the 16th ranking final of Allen's career and his third of the season, following the 2022 British Open and the 2022 Northern Irish Open. It was Ding's 21st ranking final, but his first since he had won the tournament three years previously. \nIn the afternoon session, Allen missed a red in the opening frame while on a break of 24 and Ding replied with a 52 break to go 1–0 up. Ding made a 70 break in frame two to lead 2–0, but Allen won a safety battle on the yellow in the third to put his first frame on the scoreboard at 2–1. However, Ding made back-to-back centuries of 126 and 135, extending his lead to 4–1. Allen had several chances to win the sixth frame, but Ding clinched it after Allen missed the final blue; Ding then made a 102 break in frame seven, his third century of the session, to move 6–1 in front. Allen won the last frame of the afternoon with a 79 break as the session ended 6–2 in Ding's favour. Speaking as a pundit for Eurosport, O'Sullivan criticised Allen's play during the session, calling it \"the worst I think I’ve seen from anybody in a long, long time”.\nIn the evening session, Allen made breaks of 60, 93, and 132 in the opening three frames, reducing his arrears to one at 5–6. On a break of 56 in the 12th frame, Allen went in-off. Ding secured the two snookers he needed, but missed a pot on the green, after which Allen levelled the scores at 6–6. Allen also took the next two frames with breaks of 59 and 109. After losing seven frames in a row, Ding took frame 15 with a 105 break to trail 7–8. However, Allen made breaks of 42 and 32 in the 16th frame for a 9–7 lead and then clinched the match in the 17th frame, which lasted over 40 minutes, eventually clearing from the penultimate red to win 10–7. It was Allen's first UK Championship title, his eighth ranking title, and his second Triple Crown title. He became the second Northern Irish player to win the UK Championship, following Alex Higgins in 1983. His comeback from 1–6 behind also saw him overcome the largest deficit in a UK Championship final since Higgins came from 0–7 behind to defeat Steve Davis 16–15 in that year. Allen had trailed by at least two frames in every match he played in the tournament. \"To beat Ding in the best of 19 frames match when being 6–1 down is one of my best-ever wins—he's an absolute legend\", said Allen. Allen's win took him from ninth to fifth place in the world rankings, while Ding as runner-up advanced from 38th to 19th place.\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the main stage of the tournament is shown below.

        "text": "Group A of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 20 to 29 November 2022. The group consisted of the host nation Qatar as well as Ecuador, Senegal and the Netherlands. The top two teams, the Netherlands and Senegal, advanced to the round of 16. Qatar became the first host nation to lose every group game in the World Cup history, becoming the worst performing host.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nThe match between Senegal and the Netherlands was originally scheduled to be the opening match of the tournament on 21 November 2022, 13:00, while the match between Qatar and Ecuador would take place later that day at 19:00. However, FIFA adjusted the match schedule on 11 August 2022, moving the Qatar–Ecuador fixture to 20 November in order for the hosts to feature in the opening match of the tournament. As a result, the Senegal–Netherlands fixture was pushed back to 19:00 on 21 November.\nQatar vs Ecuador.\nThe two teams had faced each other three times, most recently in 2018, a 4–3 win for Qatar in a friendly game. This was their first competitive meeting.\nEcuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes, but eventually won the match 2–0 with a brace by Enner Valencia. Valencia opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a penalty, shooting low to the right corner after being brought down in the penalty area by Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb. He scored his second in the 31st minute with a downward header to the left corner of the net after a cross in from the right by Ángelo Preciado.\nThis was the third consecutive FIFA World Cup in which a player scored a brace in the opening match, after Brazil's Neymar in 2014 and Russia's Denis Cheryshev in 2018. This was also the first time a penalty kick had been scored as the opening goal of a World Cup. Qatar became the 14th debutant to lose their opening fixture; additionally, they became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\nSenegal vs Netherlands.\nThe teams had never met before.\nAfter a goalless first half, Cody Gakpo put the Netherlands ahead in the 84th minute when he got to the ball first to head past the advancing goalkeeper Édouard Mendy and into the empty net after a cross from Frenkie de Jong. In stoppage time, Davy Klaassen made it 2–0 when he followed up on Memphis Depay's saved shot to slot into the net.\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\nQatar vs Senegal.\nThe two teams had never met before, though the match was unique for being the first time ever the Asian champions faced the African champions at a FIFA World Cup.\nBoulaye Dia put Senegal in front in the 41st minute, with a low finish to the left corner of the net after a mistake by Qatar defender Boualem Khoukhi. Seven minutes later, Famara Diédhiou doubled Senegal's lead with a header from a corner taken by Ismail Jakobs. Mohammed Muntari pulled one back for Qatar in the 78th minute, the nation's first ever World Cup goal, with a header to the left corner after a cross from Ismaeel Mohammad. Bamba Dieng scored a third for Senegal in the 84th minute with a deflected shot to the net after a pass from Iliman Ndiaye on the right.\nFollowing the Netherlands' 1–1 draw with Ecuador played after this match, Qatar became the first host country to be eliminated from the group stage of the FIFA World Cup after just two games, and the second hosts after South Africa in 2010 to fail to progress to the second round. This loss also confirmed Qatar as the worst hosts by performance, as they could secure no more than three points, one short of South Africa's four.\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Ecuador.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2014, a 1–1 draw in a friendly.\nIn the sixth minute of the match, Cody Gakpo cut inside and shot into the left corner of the net from just outside the penalty area to put the Netherlands in front. Just before the first half ended, Ecuadorian defender Pervis Estupiñán deflected his teammate's shot in, but the goal was called offside. Four minutes into the second half, Enner Valencia scored his third goal of the tournament to equalize for Ecuador, converting the rebound after goalkeeper Andries Noppert had saved a shot from Estupiñán. Despite Ecuador later hitting the crossbar, the game saw no further goals and ended in a 1–1 draw.\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\nEcuador vs Senegal.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2005, a 2–1 win for Senegal in a friendly.\nIn the 44th minute, Senegal's Ismaïla Sarr was fouled in the penalty area by Piero Hincapié, with Sarr scoring the resulting penalty low to the right corner. In the 67th minute, Moisés Caicedo put Ecuador level when he finished from close range after the ball had reached him from a Félix Torres corner. With twenty minutes left in the match, captain Kalidou Koulibaly scored his first ever international goal with a volley from six yards out to put Senegal back in front.\nEcuador's loss eliminated them in the group stage for a third time after 2002 and 2014, while Senegal advanced to the knockout stage for a second time and the first since 2002.\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Qatar.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nCody Gakpo scored his third goal of the tournament to put the Netherlands in front in the 26th minute, cuting in from the left to score with a right-foot finish from just inside the penalty area. Frenkie de Jong made it 2–0 four minutes into the second half when he followed up to poke into the net from close range after goalkeeper Meshaal Barsham had saved a shot from Memphis Depay.\nIn losing to the Netherlands, Qatar became the first World Cup hosts in history to suffer three defeats and fail to earn a single point.\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied.

        "text": "The 2023 Masters (officially the 2023 Cazoo Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place from 8 to 15 January 2023 at Alexandra Palace in London, England. It was the 49th staging of the Masters, which was first held in 1975, and the second of three Triple Crown events in the 2022–23 snooker season, following the 2022 UK Championship and preceding the 2023 World Snooker Championship. Organised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by car retailer Cazoo, the tournament was broadcast by the BBC domestically, by Eurosport in Europe, and by Matchroom Sport and other broadcasters elsewhere in the world. The winner received £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000.\nThe top 16 players in the snooker world rankings as they stood after the UK Championship were invited to the event. However, the sport's governing body subsequently suspended invitees Yan Bingtao and Zhao Xintong from professional competition amid a match-fixing investigation. Yan was replaced in the draw by David Gilbert. Zhao was replaced by Hossein Vafaei, who was the only Masters debutant and the first Iranian player to compete in the tournament.\nNeil Robertson was the defending champion, having defeated Barry Hawkins 10–4 in the 2022 final. However, Robertson lost 4–6 to Shaun Murphy in the first round. Mark Williams reached the final for the first time in 20 years, becoming the oldest finalist since Ray Reardon in 1983. Judd Trump defeated Williams 10–8 in the final to capture his second Masters title, becoming the 11th player to win the title more than once. There were 30 century breaks at the tournament. The highest break prize was shared by Trump, Vafaei, and Williams, who all made 143 breaks in their quarter-final matches.\nOverview.\nThe Masters is a non-ranking snooker tournament that was first held in 1975 for ten invited players at the West Centre Hotel in London. John Spencer won the inaugural event, defeating Ray Reardon on a in the deciding frame of the final. The Masters is the second-longest-running professional snooker tournament, after the World Snooker Championship. The most successful player in its history is Ronnie O'Sullivan, who has won the title seven times, most recently in 2017.\nOrganised by the World Snooker Tour and sponsored by car retailer Cazoo, the 2023 event was the 49th staging of the tournament. The second Triple Crown event of the 2022–23 snooker season, following the 2022 UK Championship and preceding the 2023 World Snooker Championship, it took place from 8 to 15 January 2023 at Alexandra Palace in London. Matches were played as the best of 11 until the final, which was the best of 19 frames and played over two .\nThe tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport and in Europe by Eurosport. It was broadcast in China by China Central Television and Superstars Online and streamed by Huya, Youku, Migu, Douyin, and Kuaishou. It was broadcast by Now TV in Hong Kong, by DAZN in Brazil and the United States, by Fastsports HD in Pakistan, by Astro SuperSport in Malaysia, by Sport Cast in Taiwan and Indonesia, by TrueVisions in Thailand, and by Premier Sports Network and TapGO in the Philippines. In all other territories, the event was streamed by Matchroom Sport.\nParticipants.\nThe 16 highest-ranked players after the 2022 UK Championship were invited to participate in the tournament. The defending champion was Australia's Neil Robertson, who won the tournament for a second time at the 2022 Masters by defeating England's Barry Hawkins 10–4 in the final. Robertson was seeded first for the event as defending champion, while O'Sullivan was seeded second as the reigning world champion. The next six players in the world rankings were seeded and allocated fixed positions in the draw, with the remaining eight participants drawn randomly against them. The first-round draw was made during the UK Championship final, which was contested by Mark Allen and Ding Junhui on 20 November 2022.\nDing would have re-entered the top 16 and been invited to the event had he won the UK Championship, but Allen defeated him, so the last Masters spot went to 2021 champion Yan Bingtao, who was ranked 16th in the world at the cutoff. Yan was drawn against seventh seed Mark Williams. However, on 12 December 2022, the sport's governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, suspended Yan amid a match-fixing investigation, making him ineligible to compete in or attend any World Snooker Tour event. David Gilbert, ranked 17th in the world after the UK Championship, replaced Yan in the draw. On 3 January 2023, the WPBSA suspended the world number nine Zhao Xintong, who had been drawn against third seed Mark Selby in the first round, as part of the same investigation. Hossein Vafaei, ranked 18th after the UK Championship, replaced Zhao in the draw. Vafaei was the only Masters debutant at the 2023 event and the first Iranian player to compete in the tournament.\nPrize money.\nThe winner of the event received £250,000 from a total prize pool of £725,000. The breakdown of prize money for the event is shown below:\nSummary.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played from 8 to 11 January as the best of 11 frames. On the opening afternoon, 2015 winner Shaun Murphy faced the defending champion Robertson, who won the first frame. Murphy then won five consecutive frames, making a century break in frame six after a from Robertson, to move one frame from victory. However, Robertson won the next three frames, including a maximum break attempt in the ninth, which ended when he missed the 14th . Robertson had chances in the tenth to force a but missed a key shot on the after potting the penultimate red, which allowed Murphy to clinch the match 6–4. Afterwards, Robertson said that a bad flu had affected his preparation for the event as well as his performance in the match. In the evening, debutant Vafaei faced three-time winner Selby. The scores were tied at 2–2 at the mid-session interval, but Vafaei won all four frames played after the interval for a 6–2 victory, making two centuries and three in the match. It was the third consecutive time Vafaei had beaten Selby, after eliminating him in the previous two UK Championships; it was also the ninth consecutive year Selby had lost at either the first-round or quarter-final stage, having last reached the semi-finals in 2014. Vafaei paid tribute to Selby, calling him a \"tough opponent\" and a \"legend\", and commented: \"Am I asleep or awake? Honestly I can't believe it\".\nLuca Brecel faced world number one O'Sullivan, who took the opening frame with a 97 break and won both the second and third on the after errors from his opponent. Although Brecel made a century break to win frame four, O’Sullivan responded with back-to-back centuries of 134 and 104 before wrapping up a 6–1 victory in frame seven. O'Sullivan commented: \"It is not easy to play under pressure and I sensed that Luca felt a little uncomfortable and I tried to make the most of that and punish every mistake he made\". In the evening, Jack Lisowski, who had won just four frames across his three previous Masters appearances, faced two-time winner John Higgins, who was playing in the tournament for a record-extending 29th time. Higgins made a 142 break in the third frame but Lisowski led 3–1 at the interval. Higgins won frame five, but Lisowski made a century in the sixth and came from 55 points behind to win the seventh. Higgins attempted a maximum break in frame eight but missed the ninth black; he won the frame after Lisowski missed the last red. Lisowski clinched his first Masters victory in frame nine, making a 93 break to win 6–3. He commented afterwards that the event had \"always overawed me but the crowd were incredible and kept lifting me. I've broken my duck\". Higgins expressed frustration at his errors in the match and said he was considering working with a sports psychologist.\nThe 2018 winner Allen faced two-time runner-up Hawkins, who trailed by 55 points in the opening frame but recovered to win it on the colours. Hawkins took the next two with breaks of 76 and 114 and won frame four on the colours after Allen missed the brown to a pocket. Hawkins took the fifth with breaks of 45 and 41. In the sixth, Allen missed a rest shot while on a 45 break and then made a safety mistake with two reds remaining that let Hawkins close out a 6–0 whitewash. It was Allen's fifth consecutive first-round defeat since winning the tournament and also made him the fourth consecutive UK champion to lose in the first round of the Masters. Allen praised Hawkins's safety play, saying: \"It was probably one of the best safety performances I have ever played against as a professional\". In the evening, two-time winner Williams faced Gilbert, who had reached the semi-finals on both his previous appearances in the tournament. Williams won the first two frames with back-to-back centuries of 126 and 127 and took the third with a 95 break. After Gilbert missed a rest shot on the penultimate red in the fourth, Williams cleared to lead 4–0 at the interval. Gilbert won the fifth frame with a 59 break, and produced an 80 clearance in the sixth from 42 points behind, reducing his deficit to two frames. Even though Gilbert also made half-centuries in the next two frames, Williams won the seventh after a safety exchange on the last red and won the eighth on the colours to wrap up a 6–2 victory. Williams, referee Marcel Eckardt, and a cameraman all became involved in trying to swat a wasp during the final frame before the referee asked Williams to continue play.\nThe 2019 winner Judd Trump faced the season's British Open winner Ryan Day. The scores were tied at 3–3 after Trump made a 105 century, the highest break of the match, in the sixth frame. Day won the next two frames to move one from victory, and the ninth frame went to a re-spotted black. Day missed a pot to a baulk pocket that would have won the match, and Trump potted the black to take the frame. Day led in the tenth but missed the black after potting the last red, and Trump tied the scores at 5–5. In the deciding frame, Day played a into the while potting the black but when a red dropped into the middle pocket. Trump made a 58 break to leave Day . However, with one red remaining, Trump failed to escape from a snooker and conceded a . Day could have won the match by clearing from the free ball but missed his nominated brown to the middle pocket, and Trump potted the last red to win 6–5. \"I was a bit nervous at the start and it took going 5–3 behind to feel like the weight was lifted off me to go for my shots\", said Trump. In the final first-round match, 2018 runner-up Kyren Wilson faced 2020 winner Stuart Bingham, who won the first two frames with back-to-back centuries of 102 and 109. Bingham took the third after Wilson missed a pot on the blue and won the fourth with an 85 break. He made a 127, his third century of the match, to take a 5–0 lead. Wilson won the next two frames with breaks of 90 and 81 and won the eighth on the colours to reduce his deficit to two frames. However, Bingham sealed a 6–3 victory with a pot on the yellow in frame nine after a safety error from Wilson. “At 5–0 I was cruising then Kyren showed his true grit and made a fight of it. In the end I was lucky to get through\", Bingham commented. Wilson said: \"I was proud of the way I came back. I just played a couple of bad safeties in the last frame”.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 12 and 13 January as the best of 11 frames. Facing Williams, O'Sullivan began with a 115 century and took a 3–0 lead but he ran out of position in the fourth and Williams came from behind to win the frame with a 55 break. O'Sullivan maintained a two-frame lead at 4–2, but Williams made a 143 total clearance in frame seven and a 90 break in frame eight to level the scores at 4–4. Leading by 49 points in the ninth, O'Sullivan missed a red to a middle pocket, and Williams made a 59 clearance to take the lead at 5–4. O'Sullivan forced a deciding frame with a 77 break in the tenth, but Williams closed out a 6–5 victory with a 102 century. It was the first time Williams had beaten O'Sullivan in a Triple Crown event since the semi-finals of the 2000 UK Championship. Calling the match one of his best performances, Williams said: \"In the first three frames I didn't have a shot, he tied me up in knots but I felt the crowd wanted me to win towards the end, that is unbelievable.\" O'Sullivan said: \"I just didn't score, didn't make any breaks and my cue ball wasn't great\".\nVafaei faced Lisowski, with both players competing in their first Masters quarter-final. Lisowski, who suffered from a migraine in the hours before the match, made breaks of 96 and 76 to win the first two frames, but Vafaei responded with a 68 and a total clearance of 143 to level the scores at the mid-session interval. Vafaei won the fifth frame, but Lisowski drew level at 3–3 with a break of 67. Vafaei led in the seventh but missed a shot on the yellow with the rest, and Lisowski cleared to win the frame. Vafaei won the eighth on the colours to level the scores again at 4–4. However, Lisowski won the ninth after a safety exchange on the blue and took the tenth with a break of 74 to win the match 6–4 and advance to his second Triple Crown semi-final, after reaching the same stage at the 2022 UK Championship. Lisowski said that playing in the semi-finals \"is what I had dreamed of and had aspirations of doing when I was growing up\". Vafaei was philosophical in defeat, saying: \"You need to lose until you learn how to win\".\nFacing Hawkins, Trump won a safety battle on the penultimate red to take the opening frame. Hawkins responded with a 110 century to win the second and also took the third, before Trump levelled the scores at the mid-session interval with a 69 break. In the fifth, Hawkins led by 39 points when he missed a black off the spot, allowing Trump to win the frame with a 61 break. In the sixth, Hawkins missed a red that would have left his opponent requiring snookers; Trump attempted a counter-clearance, but missed the black after potting the last red, and Hawkins tied the scores at 3–3. Hawkins went ahead with a 66 break in frame seven, but Trump tied the scores again with a 143 total clearance in the eighth, his highest ever break at the Masters. Hawkins won the ninth, aided by a fluke on a red, but Trump forced a deciding frame with a 107 break and then made an 81 break to win the match 6–5. Afterwards, Hawkins expressed frustration with his positional play and said that Trump, even though not at his best, deserved to win. Trump stated that he had suffered from nerves in his matches but said: \"I seemed to relax, get control and felt my best towards the end\". Speaking as a pundit for the BBC, six-time winner Stephen Hendry praised Trump's performance, saying: \"A sign of a true great and a world-class player is to produce the best snooker when you have your back against the wall. The frames he won at the end of the match were magnificent\".\nIn the last quarter-final, Bingham faced Murphy. Bingham won the first frame on the colours after a fluke on the green and then made breaks of 78, 128, and 107 to lead 4–0 at the mid-session interval. Bingham won the fifth after Murphy missed a red and received 24 points in fouls in the sixth frame as Murphy attempted to escape from a snooker. Bingham wrapped up a 6–0 whitewash with a break of 65. \"I got a bit lucky in the first frame which settled me down, and after that I went from strength to strength\", Bingham commented afterwards. \"My preparation for this match was very good but I was beaten by someone who played like a superhero\", said Murphy.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played on 14 January as the best of 11 frames. In the first semi-final, Lisowski faced Williams, who made two half-centuries as he moved into a 3–0 lead. Lisowski led in the fourth frame but played a poor safety shot on the penultimate red, and Williams took the frame to lead 4–0 at the interval. Williams made another half-century to go 5–0 ahead. Lisowski had a chance to win the sixth on the colours but played a poor positional shot to get on the brown. After a safety exchange, Williams potted the brown, blue, and pink to wrap up a 6–0 whitewash. \"There were no century breaks but I maybe had three or four breaks from positions where the balls weren't easy. Those breaks are as good as any century\", said Williams. \"It wasn't meant to be. I couldn't get anything going and he just shut me out\", commented Lisowski.\nIn the other semi-final, Bingham met Trump, who made breaks of 58 and 87 to win the opening two frames. Trump led by 38 points in the third when he missed a red; Bingham produced a frame-winning 93 clearance, his only break over 50 in the match. The fourth frame was decided when Bingham went in-off after a lengthy safety exchange on the green, enabling Trump to take a 3–1 lead at the mid-session interval. Trump won the 45-minute fifth frame after safety battles on the yellow and blue and won the sixth frame by potting the penultimate red and a green. He made a 58 break in the seventh before missing a red; Bingham obtained two snookers before Trump closed out a 6–1 victory on the colours. The match was noted for numerous errors by both players. Trump indicated that he needed to play better in the final, saying “I need to step up my game, the way I played tonight won’t work against Mark, he won’t play that badly\".\nFinal.\nThe final took place on 15 January as a best-of-19-frame match, played over two sessions, between fourth seed Trump and seventh seed Williams. Trump was contesting his second Masters final while Williams was competing in his fourth. Williams had last reached the final at the 2003 event, when he won his second title with a 10–4 victory over Hendry. Aged 47 years and 300 days, he became the oldest finalist since Ray Reardon in 1983.\nWilliams won the first frame with a total clearance of 138. Trump won the next four frames, making a 106 century in the fourth, to lead 4–1. Williams took the next two frames, making a 100 century in the sixth, reducing Trump's lead to one. In frame eight, Williams missed a double, allowing Trump to make an 89 break and lead 5–3 after the first session. In the evening session, the first two frames were shared before Williams won three consecutive frames to take the lead at 7–6. The 57-minute 14th frame went to Trump after Williams conceded three fouls while attempting to escape from a snooker on the green, leaving himself requiring snookers. Williams made a 107 break in the 15th to regain the lead at 8–7, but Trump levelled again at 8–8 after snookering Williams on the yellow. Trump cleared from the last red to win the 17th frame after Williams made a safety error. Williams had the first scoring opportunity in the 18th, but he missed a long red to a baulk corner pocket. Trump made a 126 break, the fifth century of the final, to win the match 10–8 and capture his second Masters title, becoming the 11th player to win the tournament more than once. Trump said: \"This is by far my best ever win. The way I played this week is not my best, but this is my best ever performance to grind out and win this\". Williams said: \"It was a great game and a great occasion, the crowd was unbelievable. I played well and tried as hard as I could. I had a couple of chances to go 8–6 up, but not easy ones. I loved every minute of it, I just didn’t get over the line\".\nTournament draw.\nNumbers given on the left show the players' seedings in the tournament draw. Players in bold denote match winners.\nCentury breaks.\nThere were 30 century breaks made during the tournament. For every century at the event, the World Snooker Tour donated £500 to the Jessie May Children's Hospice, which received a total donation of £15,000."

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup Group B",
        "text": "Group B of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 21 to 29 November 2022. The group consisted of national association football teams from England, Iran, the United States and Wales. Both England and the United States progressed to the round of 16 undefeated. England won the group, winning two games and drawing the other, while the United States won one game and drew the other two. Iran finished the group third, having won a game, with Wales finishing fourth with a single point.\nInitially noted for unusually containing four teams all ranked in the top 20 at the time of the tournament, as well as two teams within the same sovereign state and other geopolitical conflicts, various incidents relating to Qatar's ban on LGBTQ+ symbols affected the games on the first match day.\nTeams.\nThe teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1 April 2022. The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings. The first team drawn was England, which secured qualification as a pot one team by winning Group I of UEFA qualification. The second pot team, the United States, qualified by finishing third in CONCACAF qualification. The third team was Iran, which won Group A of the AFC third round. The final team was not known at the time of the draw, as it was the UEFA second round Path A winner. Wales defeated Ukraine 1–0 to qualify for this position.\nGroup B was widely described as the \"group of death\" before the tournament. It had the highest average FIFA ranking of any group, and controversy given the political hostility between Iran and the United Kingdom, and between Iran and the United States.\nNotes\nLGBT symbol incidents.\nCaptains' armbands.\nEngland captain Harry Kane, Wales captain Gareth Bale, and several other European captains intended to wear OneLove rainbow armbands promoting acceptance and diversity during the World Cup; shortly before England's opening match (the first match to feature one of these nations), however, FIFA announced that players wearing these armbands would face \"unlimited\" sanctions, with a yellow card given at minimum. The affected football associations said they would not put their players in this position, criticising FIFA for the ruling. A spokesperson for Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, also criticised FIFA for introducing player punishment for the armbands. After the first United States match, and though the US had not been intending to wear the armband, Antony Blinken, the United States Secretary of State, described the ban as \"concerning\".\nAt the England–Iran match, BBC pundit and former England women's team captain Alex Scott chose to wear a OneLove armband while being interviewed pitchside ahead of the match, a move that was praised on social media. At the United States–Wales match, though she did not appear on screen, German ZDF broadcaster Claudia Neumann wore a rainbow armband and Pride shirt, later telling the Sport-Informations-Dienst that she wanted to set an example, lamenting that the captains would not be able to wear the armbands. England would change their armband to one that simply read \"no discrimination\". During England's second match, the Wembley Stadium arch, iconic of the team's home stadium, was lit up in rainbow colours.\nOther Pride items.\nMany Wales fans in attendance at their first match as part of the nation's official LGBTQ+ supporters group wore the group's rainbow Wales bucket hats. Women who had these hats, including former women's team captain Laura McAllister, were prohibited from entering the stadium with them; McAllister reported that the security officials told her it was \"a banned symbol\". At the same match, American journalist Grant Wahl was reportedly detained for 25 minutes when attempting to enter the stadium wearing a Pride shirt, being told it was \"political\" and being asked if he was British; he said that FIFA later apologised to him and security allowed him to enter with the shirt.\nAfter the match, the Football Association of Wales confronted FIFA about the confiscation of the bucket hats, and FIFA entered talks with the Qatari Supreme Committee to discuss Qatar's commitment to make all fans welcome at the World Cup, also citing an incident of an American fan with a rainbow flag being harassed.\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nMatches took place between 21 and 29 November 2022. All times listed are local, AST ().\nEngland vs Iran.\nThe opening match of Group B was contested between England and Iran. The two sides had never played each other in a competitive match. Many England supporters missed the start of the match due to problems with FIFA's ticketing app. In defiance of their government, the Iranian team refused to sing their national anthem ahead of the match, a sign of support for the Mahsa Amini protests in their own country. Many Iranian women, some of them bearing protest signs, were in attendance at the match, a gesture which by itself was considered an act of protest as women are barred from football matches in Iran.\nThe match was delayed for seven minutes in the first half after head to head collision between the Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand and defender Majid Hosseini. Beiranvand initially seemed to be convinced to continue playing by Iran captain Ehsan Hajsafi despite appearing to be dazed and taking his gloves and shirt off after he received treatment, drawing criticism from the brain injury charity Headway. After collapsing on the field minutes later, Beiranvand was substituted for Hossein Hosseini. England scored three first-half goals: Jude Bellingham opened with his first ever senior England goal in the 35th minute, with Bukayo Saka (in the 43rd minute) and Raheem Sterling (in the first minute of stoppage time) being the other contributors to the scoreline up to this point.\nIn the second half, England's Saka scored his second of the game in the 62nd minute, before Iran's Mehdi Taremi scored with their first shot on target. England defender Harry Maguire was then removed from play after also suffering a head injury. Substitute Marcus Rashford, who had been introduced a minute before, scored England's fifth goal with his third touch of the game. Shortly into stoppage time, Jack Grealish scored England's sixth goal. The final goal, a contentious penalty kick for Iran, was scored two-and-a-half minutes after the final whistle, awarded only after a review of a late-occurring foul was suggested by the VAR. Taremi converted from the penalty kick with the final score being 6–2. \nThe Iranian media blamed the \"humiliating\" loss on the protests in their country affecting their players' mindset, additionally claiming that the United States and its allies, including the United Kingdom, had manufactured the protests to disrupt Iran; though these nations comprise all of Iran's group stage competition, the line of blame is common due to longstanding political tensions. Iran manager Queiroz had supported protests by players prior to the tournament, then said that such protests were \"not welcomed\" following the loss.\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\nUnited States vs Wales.\nThe teams had met twice previously, both in friendly matches: the United States won 2–0 in 2003 and the two teams drew 0–0 in 2020. The game was broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom, with the network announcing during the broadcast that its technical director, Roger Pearce, had died in Qatar.\nThe United States scored the opening goal in the 32nd minute, when Timothy Weah scored after a pass over the top by Christian Pulisic. The United States had the better of the chances in the first half, but in the second half Wales improved, particularly after introducing substitute Kieffer Moore. In the second period, Wales had a chance to equalize through Ben Davies, but the header was saved. Wales would nonetheless eventually manage to score their first World Cup goal in 64 years, after Bale was fouled in the box by Walker Zimmerman and scored the resulting penalty kick himself. After over nine minutes of stoppage time, the match finished 1–1, with the United States picking up four yellow cards, the most they had received in a World Cup game since their 2002 quarter-final against Germany.\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\nWales vs Iran.\nWales had faced Iran previously only once, a 1–0 friendly win in 1978. The Iranian team opted to sing their national anthem at this match.\nThe game was driven by Iran in attack and quick counter-attack, with Wales mostly holding in defence; though Wales made attempts in attack, their midfield was described by BBC Sport's Dafydd Pritchard as \"worryingly porous\". In the first half, Iran had a goal from Ali Gholizadeh disallowed by VAR for offside. Early in the second half, Iran had two attempts hit each post in quick succession. In the 86th minute, Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was originally given a yellow card for a foul he committed outside his penalty area. However, following review by VAR, this was upgraded to a red card. Iran substitute Rouzbeh Cheshmi scored the match's first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by Ramin Rezaeian scoring three minutes later to give Iran a first-ever win against a European team at the FIFA World Cup. Cheshmi's goal was the latest-minute match-winning goal scored in any World Cup game (excluding extra time) since the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, when exact goal times were first made available. Officially, nine minutes of stoppage time were added; with further delays in the added time, over twelve minutes were actually played.\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\nEngland vs United States.\nThe sides had previously met twice in the World Cup: the United States famously won 1–0 in the 1950 tournament in Brazil, and the teams drew 1–1 in the 2010 edition in South Africa. Their most recent meeting was a 3–0 friendly victory for England in 2018.\nHarry Kane had a shot blocked in the box for England in the 9th minute, before United States midfielder Weston McKennie missed a shot in the six-yard box, and teammate Christian Pulisic hit the crossbar in the 32nd minute. The match featured only a small number of chances, with only four shots on target between the two teams. Despite avoiding defeat, many England fans booed the team after the match ended, expressing criticism of a perceived lacking performance.\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\nWales vs England.\nThe teams had met 103 times, most recently in a friendly game in 2020 won 3–0 by England. This was their second meeting in a major tournament, the first being the group stage of UEFA Euro 2016, which ended in a 2–1 win for England. The teams had met in multiple FIFA World Cup qualifiers, including two British Home Championship matches that served as World Cup qualifiers (in the 1949–50 British Home Championship and 1953–54 British Home Championship) as well as in the 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6 tournaments.\nMarcus Rashford had the best chance of the opening period, but his chipped shot was saved by Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward. Following a goalless first half, Rashford scored a direct free kick in the 51st minute to give England the lead. Shortly after the restart, England would double the lead after Rashford won the ball in the Welsh defence and passed to Harry Kane, whose crossed ball low from the right was converted at the back post by Phil Foden. Rashford got his second of the game in the 68th minute, with a shot from deep inside the Welsh penalty area that went through the goalkeeper's legs. The victory was enough for England to finish at the top of the group, whilst Wales finished at the bottom with just one point.\n&lt;section begin=\"B5\" /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\nIran vs United States.\nThe teams had met twice previously: Iran won 2–1 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, and the teams drew 1–1 in a 2000 friendly. Prior to the match, the United States Soccer Federation displayed the flag of Iran on social media without the emblem of the country. The removal of the emblem showed support for the women in Iran fighting for basic human rights, according to the Federation. In response, Iranian state media reported that the United States should be immediately removed from the tournament and suspended for ten games for a \"distorted image\" of the country's flag. Following this, the emblem was returned to the flag.\nBoth teams were guaranteed qualification to the round of 16 with a win, whilst Iran would qualify with a draw, provided Wales did not defeat England. Christian Pulisic scored the only goal of the game for the United States in the 38th minute, being injured in the process. The United States thus advanced to the round of 16 as group runners-up with five points, whilst England finished top of the group with seven.\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions was applied to a player in a single match."

        "text": "Group C of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022. The group consisted of eventual champions Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Poland. The top two teams, Argentina and Poland, advanced to the round of 16. This marked the first time that Mexico did not advance past the first round since 1978.\nTeams.\nThe teams were decided by the World Cup draw that took place on 1 April 2022. The group was set to receive one team from each pot, which sorted all World Cup teams by position on the FIFA World Rankings.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nArgentina vs Saudi Arabia.\nThe teams had faced each other four times prior to the tournament, most recently in 2012, a 0–0 draw in a friendly.\nArgentina took the lead in the 10th minute with a penalty from Lionel Messi, awarded for a foul on Leandro Paredes, which he rolled into the left corner. Argentina would have three further first-half goals ruled out for marginal offsides, once from Messi and twice from Lautaro Martínez. In the second half, Saudi Arabia would quickly find an equalizer, with Saleh Al-Shehri converting a low shot into the net's right corner in the 48th minute. Saudi Arabia then took the lead five minutes later when Salem Al-Dawsari curled the ball into the right corner of the net from just inside the penalty area. Following nearly fourteen minutes of stoppage time caused by a delay in the match due to Saudi defender Yasser Al-Shahrani colliding with his own goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Owais, Saudi Arabia managed to see out the victory.\nSaudi Arabia's victory ended Argentina's 36-match unbeaten streak, dating back to 2019. According to Gracenote, the win was the \"most surprising\" in World Cup history, with many calling it one of the biggest World Cup upsets of all time. This was also the first World Cup since 1990 in which Argentina lost their opening match. Following their eventual victory in the final, Argentina became just the second side to win the tournament despite losing their first game; Spain did the same in 2010 after losing their opener against Switzerland.\n&lt;section begin=C1 /&gt;&lt;section end=C1 /&gt;\nMexico vs Poland.\nThe teams had met eight times previously, including once in the World Cup, a 3–1 first group stage victory for Poland in 1978, and most recently in 2017, a 1–0 win for Mexico in a friendly.\nThe only shot on target of the first half was from Mexico's Jorge Sánchez, which was punched away by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny. In the 54th minute, Poland captain Robert Lewandowski was awarded a penalty after the video assistant referee judged that Héctor Moreno had fouled him inside the penalty area. Guillermo Ochoa saved the penalty taken by Lewandowski, diving to his left, and the game stayed goalless. At the other end of the field, Mexico had a chance to win the game as a ball into the penalty area from Edson Álvarez went towards Henry Martín who attempted to head the ball beyond Szczęsny; however, the Poland goalkeeper managed to beat the ball away.\nPoland failed to win their opening match in a World Cup for the eighth time, having won just one of their nine opening tournament games, though for the first time since 1986, they did not lose the opener.\n&lt;section begin=C2 /&gt;&lt;section end=C2 /&gt;\nPoland vs Saudi Arabia.\nThe teams had previously faced each other four times, most recently in 2006, a 2–1 win for Poland in a friendly match.\nPiotr Zieliński scored the opening goal for Poland in the 39th minute. At the end of the first half, Saleh Al-Shehri was fouled in the box and awarded a penalty kick. However, Salem Al-Dawsari's attempt would be saved by Polish goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny. In the second half, an error by Abdulellah Al-Malki led to Robert Lewandowski scoring his first World Cup goal in the 82nd minute, as Poland would win the match 2–0.\nThe result meant that Poland went unbeaten in their opening two World Cup games for the first time since 1986.\n&lt;section begin=\"C3\" /&gt;&lt;section end=C3 /&gt;\nArgentina vs Mexico.\nThe teams had faced each other at the FIFA World Cup on three previous occasions, with Argentina winning all three matches: a 6–3 group stage victory in 1930, a 2–1 round of 16 win in 2006, and another round of 16 victory by a 3–1 scoreline in 2010.\nAfter a goalless first half, Lionel Messi put Argentina in the lead in the 64th minute with a shot from outside the penalty area. Enzo Fernández made it 2–0 and secured the win in the 87th minute with a curled finish in the top right corner of the net.\nMessi's assist for Fernández's goal made him the first player to record assists at five different World Cups. The match's reported attendance of 88,966 was the highest for a World Cup fixture since the 94,194 spectators at the Rose Bowl for the 1994 final.\n&lt;section begin=C4 /&gt;&lt;section end=C4 /&gt;\nPoland vs Argentina.\nThe teams had met eleven previous times, including twice in the World Cup; Poland's 3–2 first group stage victory in 1974 and Argentina's 2–0 second group stage win in 1978.\nArgentina were awarded a first-half penalty when Polish goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny was adjudged to have made illegal contact with Lionel Messi while attempting to punch the ball away. However, Szczęsny would then keep out Messi's subsequent spot kick, saving a penalty for the second match in a row. Szczęsny would nevertheless concede for the first time in the tournament after Argentina scored twice in the second half; the first goal came from Alexis Mac Allister with a low shot to the left corner immediately following the restart, and the second from Julián Álvarez with a shot to the top right of the net, as the Argentines won 2–0 and topped the group with six points, reaching the knockout stage for the thirteenth time in their last fourteen World Cup appearances.\nSzczęsny became just the third goalkeeper to save multiple penalties at a single World Cup (excluding shoot-outs), following compatriot Jan Tomaszewski in 1974 and Brad Friedel in 2002. Despite defeat, Poland would still join Argentina in the last 16 thanks to a superior goal difference to Mexico, ending their 36-year knockout stage drought.\n&lt;section begin=C5 /&gt;&lt;section end=C5 /&gt;\nSaudi Arabia vs Mexico.\nThe teams had met five previous times, most recently in 1999, a 5–1 win for Mexico at the FIFA Confederations Cup.\nAfter a goalless first half, Mexico struck twice in the second half, first with a volley from a corner by Henry Martín in the 47th minute, and then with a thunderous free kick by Luis Chávez in the 52nd minute. However, Mexico failed to find a third goal, which they needed to overtake Poland on goal difference; Mexico had received more yellow cards than Poland and would have been eliminated on this basis if the teams finished level on points, goal difference, and goals scored. Salem Al-Dawsari, however, would score for Saudi Arabia in the fifth minute of added time with a goal after a one-two, confirming both teams' elimination as Mexico claimed the 2–1 win.\nThis was the first time Mexico failed to advance to the knockout stage at a FIFA World Cup since 1978; meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's knockout stage drought extended to 32 years, having failed to progress past the group stage since the country's tournament debut in 1994, standing as the second longest knockout stage drought after that of North Korea.\n&lt;section begin=C6 /&gt;&lt;section end=C6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied.

        "text": "Matches in Group D of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 22 to 30 November 2022. The group consisted of reigning world champions France, Australia, Denmark and Tunisia. The top two teams, France and Australia advanced to the round of 16. Australia, Denmark and France were also in Group C of the previous World Cup.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nDenmark vs Tunisia.\nThe teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2002, a 2–1 win for Denmark in a friendly game.\nDenmark were not able to capitalize in their opening game, with Andreas Cornelius heading onto the post in the 70th minute. Although Tunisia failed to score themselves, midfielder Aïssa Laïdouni earned the Man of the Match award for his defensive heroics.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\nFrance vs Australia.\nThe teams had previously faced each other five times, including once in the World Cup, a 2–1 France victory in 2018 en route to the title. They also met in Australia's 1–0 win against the reigning world champions (having previously won the 1998 World Cup) at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nCraig Goodwin gave Australia the lead in the ninth minute, when he finished at the back post high into the net after a low cross from the right by Mathew Leckie. Adrien Rabiot equalized for France when he headed to the net from a Théo Hernandez cross from the left. France took the lead five minutes later after Olivier Giroud's side footed shot found the back of the net from a low cross from Rabiot from the left. Jackson Irvine had a chance to equalize in first half stoppage time, but headed onto the post. \nIn the 68th minute, Kylian Mbappé scored France's third goal with a header from six yards out to the left corner, after a cross from Ousmane Dembélé on the right. Giroud got his second with another header after a Mbappé cross from the left to make it 4–1.\nGiroud's second goal equalled Thierry Henry's all-time scoring record of 51 goals for France. France's win marked the first time since 2006 that the defending World Cup champions won their opening game. On the other hand, Goodwin's goal was the fastest France had conceded in the tournament since 1982.\nFrench defender Lucas Hernandez suffered a torn ACL after 13 minutes of the match, ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament.\n&lt;section begin=D2 /&gt;&lt;section end=D2 /&gt;\nTunisia vs Australia.\nThe teams had previously faced each other twice, most recently in Tunisia's 2–0 win at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nAustralia beat Tunisia 1–0 as a result of a Mitchell Duke header in the 23rd minute to secure their first win in a World Cup match since they defeated Serbia 2–1 in 2010. This was also Australia's first clean sheet since they drew 0–0 with Chile in 1974.\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\nFrance vs Denmark.\nThe teams had met thrice in the World Cup, all in the group stage with three different results; France won 2–1 in 1998, Denmark won 2–0 in 2002 and the teams drew 0–0 in 2018.\nKylian Mbappé scored two goals either side of an Andreas Christensen equalizer to secure France a 2–1 win and qualify them for the knockout stage, thus becoming the first defending champions since Brazil in 2006 to advance past the first round. Among European countries, they were the first World Cup holders to qualify for the knockout stage since Germany in 1994.\n&lt;section begin=D4 /&gt;&lt;section end=D4 /&gt;\nAustralia vs Denmark.\nThe teams had met once in the World Cup, a 1–1 draw in 2018.\nAustralia won the game 1–0 to finish second in the group. The only goal of the match was scored by Mathew Leckie in the 60th minute with a low left-foot finish to the bottom right corner of the net. This result meant that Australia progressed to the knockout stage for the second time in their World Cup history, the first time since 2006 and the first time they did it as a member of the AFC. This was also the first time that Australia had won two consecutive matches, scored in every group stage game, and kept a clean sheet twice in a World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=D5 /&gt;&lt;section end=D5 /&gt;\nTunisia vs France.\nThe two teams had faced each other four times, most recently in 2010 friendly, a 1–1 draw.\nA Tunisian goal in the 8th minute was disallowed for offside, but Wahbi Khazri put Tunisia into the lead in the 58th minute with a low shot to the bottom right corner. At that stage, Tunisia was in a position to qualify from the group. However, two minutes later Australia went in front against Denmark in the other match taking place at the same time, which put Tunisia outside of the qualifying positions. In added time, Antoine Griezmann seemingly scored to make it 1–1 for France with a volley, but the goal was ruled out by the VAR for offside, despite the ball having come off a Tunisian player just before. Australia went on to beat Denmark, which meant that Tunisia finished third in the group and failed to reach the knockout stage for the sixth consecutive World Cup.\nViewers tuning in to French television for the match missed that the French team had lost the game 1–0. TF1 switched to an ad after Griezmann had seemingly levelled the game late in stoppage time, causing French viewers to miss the pitchside monitor consultation that led VAR to rule that Griezmann had been offside. French football supporters awoke in shock the following morning to belatedly discover that the game had not ended in a tie at all, but in a surprise defeat for the reigning world champions. The incident brought to mind the time British broadcaster ITV cut for an ad break and missed Steven Gerrard scoring England's opening goal at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=D6 /&gt;&lt;section end=D6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied.

        "text": "Matches in Group E of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 23 November to 1 December 2022. The group consisted of Spain, Costa Rica, Germany, and Japan. The top two teams, Japan and Spain, advanced to the round of 16. Japan became the third ever and the first Asian team to win a World Cup group since themselves in Group H and South Korea in Group D, both in the 2002 edition, a tournament both countries co-hosted. Germany was eliminated in the group stage for the second consecutive tournament after going out as defending champions in 2018. This was the second time the reigning world champions were eliminated in the group stage of the two subsequent tournaments, following Italy, who was eliminated in the following two group stages after winning the 2006 edition.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nGermany vs Japan.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2006 friendly, a 2–2 draw.\nJapan put the ball into the net 8 minutes in, but the goal was ruled out for offside. In the 33rd minute, Germany was awarded a penalty when Japanese goalkeeper Shūichi Gonda fouled David Raum inside the area. İlkay Gündoğan converted the penalty via a shot down the middle of the net, with the goalkeeper diving to the right. A German goal was declared offside before halftime.\nIn the 75th minute, Japan equalized through Ritsu Dōan, after he finished a rebound into the net following goalkeeper Manuel Neuer's save from a low shot from the left. Japan went in front eight minutes later, when Takuma Asano received the ball down the right wing before pulling away from defender Nico Schlotterbeck towards the penalty area and shooting high above Neuer into the net past the near post.\nThe result marked the second consecutive occasion that Germany lost their opening World Cup match, after a 1–0 defeat to Mexico in 2018. Following his substitution on in the 79th minute, the contest also saw the return of Mario Götze in a World Cup match, his first since scoring the decisive goal in extra time of the 2014 final against Argentina.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\nSpain vs Costa Rica.\nThe teams had met on three occasions, all of them friendlies, with the most recent being a 5–0 home win for Spain in 2017.\nSpain dominated possession, and were up 3–0 at half-time thanks to goals scored in a span of 20 minutes by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio and Ferran Torres from the penalty spot. Torres would get his second goal of the match nine minutes into the second half, before teenager Gavi scored Spain's fifth goal via an outside-of-the-foot volley in the 74th minute. Late strikes from substitutes Carlos Soler and Álvaro Morata saw the match conclude in a 7–0 Spanish win, the biggest margin of victory in a World Cup game since Portugal beat North Korea by the same scoreline in 2010. Costa Rica failed to record a single shot throughout the entirety of the contest, whilst Spain scored with each of their first seven shots on target.\nCosta Rica equalled their worst ever defeat, a 7–0 loss to Mexico in 1975, while this was Spain's biggest win at a World Cup, surpassing their 6–1 success against Bulgaria in 1998. At the age of 18 years and 110 days, Gavi became the youngest ever player to both play and score in a World Cup match for Spain; he was also the youngest player to score for any team in the competition since Pelé for Brazil in 1958.\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\nJapan vs Costa Rica.\nThe teams had previously met four times, all in friendly matches, with Japan winning three and drawing one; their most recent encounter was a 3–0 home victory for the Japanese in 2018.\nJapan, who made five changes to their starting lineup that won against Germany, dominated the match, but it was Costa Rica who would go in front with nine minutes remaining. Keysher Fuller scored with a shot from the right which was deflected and misjudged by Japan goalkeeper Shūichi Gonda, and this would end up being the only goal of the game.\n&lt;section begin=E3 /&gt;&lt;section end=E3 /&gt;\nSpain vs Germany.\nThe teams had previously met four times in the World Cup: Germany recorded a 2–1 group stage victory in 1966 and a 2–1 second group stage win in 1982, the sides had a 1–1 group stage draw in 1994, and Spain earned a 1–0 semi-final win in 2010. Their most recent meeting was in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, with Spain winning 6–0.\nIn the first half, Spain's Dani Olmo had a shot that goalkeeper Manuel Neuer turned onto the bar. In the 62nd minute, substitute Álvaro Morata put Spain into the lead when he flicked Jordi Alba's cross from the left into the net at the near post.\nWith seven minutes to go, Niclas Füllkrug, also a substitute, equalized for Germany when he lashed the ball with his right foot high past Spanish goalkeeper Unai Simón from the right. Leroy Sané nearly won the contest for Germany in stoppage time when he was through on goal, but the ball eventually went out of bounds after he ran out of space to run.\n&lt;section begin=E4 /&gt;&lt;section end=E4 /&gt;\nJapan vs Spain.\nThe teams previously faced each other once in 2001, a friendly won 1–0 by Spain.\nAfter Álvaro Morata scored with a header from five yards out after a cross from César Azpilicueta on the right to give Spain a 1–0 half-time lead, Ritsu Dōan equalized for Japan early into the second period, with his strike from outside the penalty area overpowering goalkeeper Unai Simón and going into the top right corner of the net. Ao Tanaka put Japan in front just three minutes later with a close range finish, with the assist coming from a cut-back by Kaoru Mitoma on the left, seeing the ball hover within millimeters of the left sideline. This would prove to be the decisive goal, as Japan won 2–1 to top Group E ahead of Spain and Germany, the latter being eliminated in the first round for the second tournament in a row.\nDue to the tightness of the call, the circumstances surrounding Japan's second goal sparked much discussion. The live television camera angle created an optical illusion as if the pass to Ao Tanaka was out of bounds, and the video assistant referee took several minutes to confirm that a sliver of the ball stayed in the field, making it a valid goal. The sole evidence that settled the dispute was the bird's eye photo taken by Petr David Josek, released by the Associated Press after the match. In an interview, Josek revealed that there were three other photographers allowed to enter the suspended catwalk to take bird's eye photos, but they missed Tanaka's pass because they were at the opposite side of the pitch anticipating a Spanish goal instead.\nJapan's victory with only 18% of possession was the lowest for a winning side at a FIFA World Cup match since records began in 1966. The match would later draw comparisons with the Japan's women's team 4–0 Spain women match at the 2023 Women's World Cup, which Japan women's victory with a mere 23% possession also broke the record for lowest by a winning side at the tournament since recordings began in 2011. Both the men's and women's team showed a similar tactical plan against their Spanish counterparts. Japan's progression from the group marked the first time they ever reached the knockout stage in consecutive World Cups.\n&lt;section begin=E5 /&gt;&lt;section end=E5 /&gt;\nCosta Rica vs Germany.\nThe teams had only met once prior, when hosts Germany defeated Costa Rica 4–2 in the opening match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nAfter taking the lead in the first half through Serge Gnabry, Germany would be pegged pack in the second period following goals from Costa Rica scored by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Pablo Vargas. Germany would quickly rally back with a brace from Kai Havertz and a late effort converted by Niclas Füllkrug to win the match 4–2, the same scoreline as the teams' previous World Cup encounter.\nDespite the victory, Germany were still edged out of second place in the group by Spain, as a result of the latter's superior goal difference. This meant that the 2014 champions had failed to reach the knockout stage in the two subsequent tournaments following their last World Cup title (having finished bottom of their group in 2018), the same fate that befell 2006 winners Italy in 2010 and 2014. Costa Rica exited the competition as the team with the worst goal differential, in spite of the fact they won one of their three matches.\n&lt;section begin=E6 /&gt;&lt;section end=E6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions was applied to a player in a single match."

The top two teams, Morocco and Croatia, advanced to the round of 16, and later played against each other again in the third-place play-off game, with Croatia winning 2–1. Morocco advanced to the knockout stage for the first time since 1986. By winning the group, they became the first African team to do so since Nigeria in 1998. Belgium failed to advance out of the group round for the first time, also since 1998.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nMorocco vs Croatia.\nThe teams had previously faced each other once, in a 1996 friendly match that ended in a 2–2 draw.\nAlthough Croatia dominated possession, the match was one of few chances, and ended in a scoreless draw.\nThe two sides would go on to face off again in the third place match, making this the second straight World Cup where the third place match was contested by two teams drawn in the same group (after Belgium and England did so in 2018).\n&lt;section begin=F1 /&gt;&lt;section end=F1 /&gt;\nBelgium vs Canada.\nThe teams had faced each other once prior, a 1989 friendly won 2–0 by Belgium. This match made Canada's head coach, Englishman John Herdman, the first manager to coach a team at both the men's and women's FIFA World Cup.\nDespite dominating much of proceedings and having 19 attempts on goal, including an early penalty kick taken by Alphonso Davies that was saved by Thibaut Courtois, Canada could not find a way to score, and the sole goal of the match came near the end of the first half from Belgium's Michy Batshuayi, when he converted following a long-range pass upfield from defender Toby Alderweireld.\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\nBelgium vs Morocco.\nThe teams had met in three previous matches, including Belgium's 1–0 group stage victory at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.\nRomain Saïss put Morocco in front in the 73rd minute, when he glanced the ball in at close range after a free kick whipped in from the left by Abdelhamid Sabiri deceived Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at the near post. Zakaria Aboukhlal made it 2–0 in added time when he finished high into the right corner of the net after a cut-back from Hakim Ziyech on the right.\nThe match was only Morocco's third victory in World Cup history. The result sparked riots back in Belgium (home to a large ethnic Moroccan community), with resident fires and fireworks being set off.\n&lt;section begin=F3 /&gt;&lt;section end=F3 /&gt;\nCroatia vs Canada.\nThe teams had never met before.\nAlphonso Davies scored Canada's first-ever World Cup goal in the second minute, with his header off a cross from Tajon Buchanan on the right giving Canada the lead. His effort was the fastest goal in the tournament at 68 seconds. Andrej Kramarić and Marko Livaja would strike back before half-time for Croatia to put them into 2–1 lead. Kramarić would score again in the second period before Lovro Majer took advantage of a miscontrolled ball by Kamal Miller in the dying moments of the match to complete a 4–1 Croatian victory that sealed Canada's elimination from the tournament. It was also Canada's largest ever defeat in a World Cup match.\nThe match was marred by xenophobic anti-Serb chants made by a group Croatian fans against Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan, an ethnic Croatian Serb who fled Croatia during the Croatian War of Independence, along with their display of a modified John Deere banner making a reference to Operation Storm, a military operation that ended the war and abolished the separatist proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina, which resulted in a mass exodus and war crimes against number of Krajina's Serb civilians.\n&lt;section begin=F4 /&gt;&lt;section end=F4 /&gt;\nCroatia vs Belgium.\nThe teams had previously faced each other eight times, most recently in 2021, a 1–0 win for Belgium in a friendly.\nThe first half finished goalless, with the most noticeable incident coming when Croatia was awarded a penalty following a foul by Yannick Carrasco on Andrej Kramarić, before being cancelled due to the VAR deeming Dejan Lovren marginally offside in the buildup to the call. Belgium, at this point needing a victory to avoid elimination, would bring on record goalscorer Romelu Lukaku for the second period, marking his return to action following a spell out due to injury. Lukaku missed several notable chances to score, including a strike that hit the inside of the post, as Belgium was unable to capitalize on their opportunities and succumbed to a 0–0 draw, confirming their group stage exit.\n&lt;section begin=F5 /&gt;&lt;section end=F5 /&gt;\nCanada vs Morocco.\nThe teams had previously faced each other three times, most recently in 2016, a friendly won 4–0 by Morocco.\nMorocco took an early lead through Hakim Ziyech after a misplaced pass by Canada goalkeeper Milan Borjan allowed him to score with a chip over the goalkeeper from outside the penalty area. They doubled their advantage in the 23rd minute with a goal from Youssef En-Nesyri when he ran on to a pass to score with a low finish to the right corner of the net from the right. In the final few minutes of the first half, Canada pulled a goal back when Nayef Aguerd diverted a low cross in from Sam Adekugbe on the left into his own net, marking the first own goal of the tournament as well as the first conceded by Morocco. Although Canada captain Atiba Hutchinson's header from a corner would strike the bar and the goal line in the second half, Morocco held on to win the match 2–1.\nMorocco thus finished top of Group F with seven points, reaching the knockout stage for a second time and a first since 1986. Canada, meanwhile, joined hosts Qatar as the only teams to exit the tournament without a single point, and remained winless in their World Cup history, adding on to the three defeats they suffered in 1986.\n&lt;section begin=F6 /&gt;&lt;section end=F6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if teams' overall and head-to-head records were tied.

The top two teams, Brazil and Switzerland, advanced to the round of 16. This was unprecedented in World Cup history as Brazil won the group despite scoring fewer goals than each of their opponents. Brazil, Serbia and Switzerland also played in Group E at the previous FIFA World Cup.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nSwitzerland vs Cameroon.\nThe teams had never met before.\nAfter a goalless first half, Breel Embolo scored the only goal of the match three minutes into the second period, finishing from six yards out after a cross from Xherdan Shaqiri on the right. Embolo did not celebrate the goal in respect to being born in Cameroon; he moved to Switzerland when he was six years old.\n&lt;section begin=G1 /&gt;&lt;section end=G1 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Serbia.\nThe teams had met once in the World Cup, in Brazil's 2–0 group stage victory in 2018. With Serbia playing as Yugoslavia, the sides had met 18 times, including four encounters in FIFA World Cup group stages: in 1930, 1950, 1954 and 1974, with one victory for each and two draws.\nAfter a goalless first half, Richarlison opened the scoring for Brazil in the 62nd minute, when he followed up to finish after Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinković-Savić saved Vinícius Júnior's low shot from the left, with Neymar initially creating the chance. Richarlison then made it 2–0 eleven minutes later when he controlled the ball from Vinícius Júnior before finishing to the left of the net with an over-the-shoulder acrobatic right-footed kick. Casemiro hit the woodwork and Fred also had a shot saved with Brazil running out comfortable 2–0 winners.\n&lt;section begin=G2 /&gt;&lt;section end=G2 /&gt;\nCameroon vs Serbia.\nThe teams had faced each other once, a 2010 friendly won 4–3 by Serbia.\nJean-Charles Castelletto put Cameroon into the lead in the 29th minute, when he finished from close range off of a corner. In first-half stoppage time, Strahinja Pavlović equalized with a header, before Sergej Milinković-Savić brought Serbia ahead just two minutes later with a low finish into the corner of the net. Eight minutes into the second half, Aleksandar Mitrović put Serbia 3–1 up with a low finish after a passing move. Vincent Aboubakar scooped the ball over goalkeeper Vanja Milinković-Savić to score Cameroon's second goal in the 63rd minute, awarded by the VAR after initially being deemed offside, before Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting completed the comeback three minutes later with a low shot after a pass from the right by Aboubakar. The match finished in an entertaining 3–3 draw.\nThis was Cameroon's first point in a World Cup match since 2002, ending an eight-game losing streak.\n&lt;section begin=G3 /&gt;&lt;section end=G3 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Switzerland.\nThe teams had met nine times prior, including two draws coming in World Cup group stage matches: 2–2 in 1950 and 1–1 in 2018.\nBrazil started the game without the injured Neymar, who was ruled out for the remainder of the group stage after spraining his ankle in the previous match. The only goal of the game was scored by Brazilian midfielder Casemiro in the 83rd minute, when his deflected right-footed shot from inside the penalty area struck the top corner of the net.\nThe win secured Brazil's passage to the knockout stage, and was their first victory in three attempts against Switzerland at the FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=G4 /&gt;&lt;section end=G4 /&gt;\nSerbia vs Switzerland.\nThe teams had met once before, in Switzerland's 2–1 group stage victory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. With Serbia playing as Yugoslavia, the two teams had met 13 times, including in the 1950 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 3–0 victory for Yugoslavia.\nIn an open and entertaining match, Andrija Živković struck the post early on for Serbia, before Xherdan Shaqiri opened the scoring for Switzerland via a deflection, becoming the first Swiss player to score at three different World Cups. Aleksandar Mitrović equalized just six minutes later with a header off of a Dušan Tadić cross, before a poor clearance by Swiss midfielder Remo Freuler allowed Dušan Vlahović to put Serbia in front. The first half would end 2–2 after Breel Embolo brought Switzerland level off of a Silvan Widmer cross.\nSerbia, who needed a victory to have a chance of reaching the knockout stage, then went behind again early into the second half, after Freuler finished off a Swiss team goal with a volley. The game became ill-tempered, similar to the sides' previous encounter in 2018, and saw both sets of players scuffle multiple times, primarily triggered after provocation towards the Serbian bench by Swiss captain Granit Xhaka, an ethnic Albanian. The eleven yellow cards distributed during the contest was the most shown in a World Cup match since the twelve given in the 2010 final. Switzerland ultimately retained their lead and won the match 3–2.\nTheir two group stage victories saw Switzerland progress to the knockout stage as runners-up for a third successive World Cup, while Serbia finished bottom and were eliminated in the first round for their fourth tournament in a row.\n&lt;section begin=G5 /&gt;&lt;section end=G5 /&gt;\nCameroon vs Brazil.\nThe teams had previously met six times, including in two World Cup group stage games, both won by Brazil: a 3–0 victory in 1994 and a 4–1 win in 2014.\nBrazil, already assured a place in the knockout stage, made ten changes to their previous starting lineup. Despite the Brazilians having the majority of the game's chances, Cameroon would take the lead in second-half stoppage time, after Vincent Aboubakar ran into the penalty area to head the cross from Jerome Ngom Mbekeli on the right into the net's bottom corner from six yards out.\nAboubakar celebrated the goal by removing his shirt, receiving a second yellow card and thus being sent off.\nThe match marked Brazil's first defeat in the group stage of a World Cup since losing to Norway in 1998. Despite their loss, Brazil clinched top spot in Group G on goal difference as they progressed to the knockout stage. Although they were still eliminated, Cameroon became the first African team to defeat Brazil at a World Cup, with this victory also being their first at the tournament since beating Saudi Arabia in 2002.

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup Group H",
        "text": "Matches in Group H of the 2022 FIFA World Cup took place from 24 November to 2 December 2022. The group consisted of Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay and South Korea. The top two teams, Portugal and South Korea, advanced to the round of 16. Uruguay exited the tournament after failing to progress the group stage for the first time since 2002, with South Korea's shock 2–1 victory over Portugal contributing to the elimination.\nTeams.\nNotes\nStandings.\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local, AST ().\nUruguay vs South Korea.\nThe teams had previously met eight times, including twice in the World Cup, both matches won by Uruguay: a 1–0 group stage victory in 1990 and a 2–1 round of 16 success in 2010.\nThe match ended in a goalless draw, with the best chances coming when Diego Godín and Federico Valverde both hit the post for Uruguay.\n&lt;section begin=H1 /&gt;&lt;section end=H1 /&gt;\nPortugal vs Ghana.\nThe teams had met once before, being Portugal's 2–1 group stage victory at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\nAfter a goalless first half, Portugal were awarded a penalty in the 65th minute, when Mohammed Salisu fouled Cristiano Ronaldo in the penalty area. Ronaldo took the penalty and scored, shooting high to the left of the goalkeeper, to put Portugal into the lead. André Ayew equalised for Ghana in the 73rd minute with a close range finish after a low cross from Mohammed Kudus on the left. Portugal swiftly responded with two quick goals from World Cup debutants, the first coming from João Félix in the 78th minute with a clipped finish from the right over the advancing goalkeeper, and the second from substitute Rafael Leão two minutes later with a low finish into the right corner of the goal after a pass from Bruno Fernandes. In the 89th minute, Ghanaian substitute Osman Bukari scored with a header from six yards out to reduce the deficit. Then, in stoppage time, Ghana nearly equalized when Portugal goalkeeper Diogo Costa put the ball on the ground, preparing to kick it upfield, and Ghana's Iñaki Williams came from behind Costa to take the ball but slipped as he was about to shoot, with the ball subsequently cleared from danger by Portugal.\nWith his goal, Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five different FIFA World Cup tournaments. At the age of 37 years and 292 days, he also became the second-oldest player to score at a World Cup, behind only Roger Milla for Cameroon in 1994 (aged 42 years and 39 days).\n&lt;section begin=H2 /&gt;&lt;section end=H2 /&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Ghana.\nThe teams had faced each other eight times, most recently in 2014, 4–0 friendly win by Ghana.\nIn the first half, Ghana scored two goals against the run of play within a ten-minute span to take a 2–0 lead, coming from Mohammed Salisu and Mohammed Kudus. South Korea would then reply in the second half with two goals of their own, both headers scored within three minutes of each other by Cho Gue-sung, to level the game at 2–2. Kudus scored the decisive goal and his second of the match in the 68th minute, coming after Iñaki Williams had mistimed his initial shot, to put Ghana back in front. Ghanaian goalkeeper Lawrence Ati-Zigi made multiple crucial saves and Salisu cleared an effort off the line late on to secure them a 3–2 victory.\nCho Gue-sung and Kudus each became the first players to score multiple goals in a single World Cup match for their respective countries.\nWhen referee Anthony Taylor ended the game instead of allowing a South Korean player to kick off a corner, South Korea's head coach Paulo Bento ran onto the field and screamed at the referee, for which he was shown a red card, making it the first time in World Cup history that a coach was sent off after the conclusion of the match. Counting players' Leandro Cufré's and Josip Šimunić's red cards (both in 2006), this was the third time a sending off occurred after the match had ended.\n&lt;section begin=H3 /&gt;&lt;section end=H3 /&gt;\nPortugal vs Uruguay.\nThe teams had met three times prior, including Uruguay's 2–1 round of 16 victory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nBruno Fernandes put Portugal into the lead during the second half when his cross from the left deceived Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet, after Cristiano Ronaldo had tried to glance the ball past him with his head. Ronaldo was initially ruled as the goalscorer before FIFA determined that he hadn't connected with the ball, and instead awarded the goal to Fernandes. Fernandes scored a second in the third minute of stoppage time, a penalty awarded by the VAR for handball by José Giménez, which he rolled into the left side of the net.\nWith this victory, Portugal secured a place in the knockout stage.\n&lt;section begin=H4 /&gt;&lt;section end=H4 /&gt;\nGhana vs Uruguay.\nThe teams had one prior meeting, which came in the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals; Uruguay won 4–2 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after extra time.\nIn the first half, Ghana were awarded a penalty after Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet was adjudged to have fouled Mohammed Kudus inside the area; however, Rochet then saved the subsequent spot kick taken by Ghana captain André Ayew. Shortly after this, midfielder Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored Uruguay's first two goals of the tournament within a span of six minutes to earn his side a 2–0 half-time lead, which saw them rise to second place in the live group standings. However, Uruguay would then be pushed down to third in the table on goals scored following South Korea's winner against Portugal late into the second half of the group's other ongoing game. Uruguay were unable to find the third goal they now required to advance, with Ghana keeper Lawrence Ati-Zigi making saves late on to deny both Edinson Cavani and Maxi Gómez, and thus failed to progress past the first round for the first time since 2002. Defeat also saw Ghana eliminated, finishing bottom of the group with only three points.\nReferee Daniel Siebert and his assistants were angrily confronted by Uruguayan players following the final whistle, after both Siebert and the VAR had disagreed with Uruguay's penalty appeals in the second half: first for a coming together between Darwin Núñez and Ghana's Alidu Seidu, and then in stoppage time after Cavani went down in the area. In January 2023, FIFA would go on to punish several Uruguayan players for their actions in the aftermath of the contest, deeming their behaviour \"discriminatory\", \"offensive\", and a \"violation of the principles of fair play\"; substitute keeper Fernando Muslera and defender José Giménez both received four-match bans, while Cavani and captain Diego Godín each served a one-game suspension. All four players were also required to pay fines along with the nation's football association, and carry out a form of football community service.\nWith De Arrascaeta's goals, Uruguay became the last team of all 32 participants to score at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=H5 /&gt;&lt;section end=H5 /&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Portugal.\nPrior to this match, the teams had met once before, being South Korea's 1–0 group stage victory in the 2002 FIFA World Cup (which they co-hosted with Japan).\nA rotated Portugal side took the lead in the opening five minutes, when Ricardo Horta scored on his World Cup debut with a first-time shot. South Korea would equalize in the 27th minute, when Portugal failed to clear a corner which hit the back of Cristiano Ronaldo, landing at the feet of Kim Young-gwon who scored from close range. In a second half where both sides saw opportunities, South Korea would find the winner in stoppage time, after Son Heung-min recovered the ball off a counter from a Portugal corner and slipped it to Hwang Hee-chan, who finished his shot into the bottom corner of the net.\nThis late victory saw South Korea leapfrog Uruguay in the group standings on goals scored to join Portugal in the knockout stage, progressing to the second round for the first time since 2010.\n&lt;section begin=H6 /&gt;&lt;section end=H6 /&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions was applied to a player in a single match."

        "title": "2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage",
        "text": "The knockout stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup was the second and final stage of the competition, following the group stage. Played from 3 to 18 December, the knockout stage ended with the final, held at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar. The top two teams from each group advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination tournament. There were 16 matches in the knockout stage, including a third place play-off played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nFormat.\nThe knockout stage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup was contested between 16 teams that qualified from the group stage. Matches in the knockout stage were played to a finish. If the score of a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of playing time, extra time was played. If, after two periods of 15 minutes, the scores were still tied, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. All times listed are local in Arabia Standard Time ().\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nBracket.\nThe tournament bracket is shown below, with bold denoting the winners of each match.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nNetherlands vs United States.\nThe teams had previously met five times, with the Netherlands winning the first four encounters. They most recently met in a June 2015 friendly, with the United States winning 4–3.\nEarly on in the contest, Christian Pulisic was sent through on goal for the United States but saw his shot saved by the outstretched leg of goalkeeper Andries Noppert. The Netherlands then went in front in the 10th minute, when Memphis Depay received a ball from the right from Denzel Dumfries and finished into the left corner of the net after a sequence of passes. In added time in the first half, Daley Blind made it 2–0 for the Dutch with another low finish, receiving the ball on the right from Dumfries for his second assist of the game. In the 76th minute, the United States pulled a goal back when Haji Wright finished with a deflection from Christian Pulisic's looped cross at the far post. Dumfries sealed the win with a third goal for the Netherlands five minutes later, adding to his two assists with a side-footed finish at the far post from Blind's cross.\n&lt;section begin=R16-1 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-1 /&gt;\nArgentina vs Australia.\nThe teams had previously met seven times, with Argentina winning five, drawing one, and losing one of these encounters. The sides notably met in the 1994 FIFA World Cup inter-confederation play-off, which Argentina won 2–1 on aggregate. They also faced off in Argentina's 4–2 win at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Their most recent meeting was in a September 2007 friendly, with Argentina winning 1–0.\nOn his 1,000th career appearance, Lionel Messi scored his 789th career goal and first in a World Cup knockout stage, giving Argentina the lead in the 35th minute with a low left-footed finish into the left corner. Julián Álvarez made it 2–0 in the 57th minute when he pounced on an error by Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to finish low to the net past the stranded goalkeeper. Australia pulled a goal back in the 77th minute when Craig Goodwin's strike took a huge deflection off Enzo Fernández and ended up in the right corner of the net. Australia had chances to level the match, first when Aziz Behich dribbled past four players before his shot was blocked by Lisandro Martínez, then in added time when Garang Kuol had a shot saved at close range by Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez. Argentina also spurned several opportunities to add to their advantage, with substitute Lautaro Martínez guilty of squandering multiple chances.\n&lt;section begin=R16-2 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-2 /&gt;\nFrance vs Poland.\nThe teams had met sixteen times prior to this match, with France winning eight and Poland winning three of these encounters, along with five draws. Poland's three victories included the 1982 World Cup third-place play-off, which they won 3–2. The sides most recently met in a friendly in June 2011, won by France 1–0.\nAfter Olivier Giroud missed a chance for France in front of goal off a cross from Ousmane Dembélé, Poland nearly opened the scoring later in the first half when Piotr Zieliński saw two close-range shots blocked in quick succession. In the 44th minute, Giroud received a pass from Kylian Mbappé before firing low to the right corner of the net to put France into the lead, in the process also breaking the all-time French scoring record with his 52nd goal for the nation. Mbappé made it 2–0 in the 74th minute, when he received the ball on the left just inside the penalty area before firing powerfully into the top left corner of the net. Mbappé got his second of the game in the first minute of added time with a right-footed curling finish past goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny. In the final minute of the match, Robert Lewandowski pulled a goal back for Poland to make it 3–1 with a penalty low to the left corner, awarded after a handball by Dayot Upamecano; goalkeeper Hugo Lloris saved Lewandowski's initial attempt, but it was retaken after Lloris was deemed to have left his goal line too early.\n&lt;section begin=R16-3 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-3 /&gt;\nEngland vs Senegal.\nThis was the first ever meeting between the sides. It was also the first time England faced an African opposition in the World Cup knockout stage since a 1990 quarter-final win over Cameroon.\nAfter a tight opening period where Senegal's Boulaye Dia saw his strike saved by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, England went in front in the 38th minute, when Jordan Henderson scored low into the net from twelve yards off of a pass from Jude Bellingham on the left. In added time in the first half, reigning World Cup Golden Boot winner Harry Kane made it 2–0 with his first goal of the tournament, firing into the net from the right after a pass from Phil Foden. In the 57th minute, Foden crossed from the left for Bukayo Saka to make it 3–0 with a clipped left-footed finish over Senegal goalkeeper Édouard Mendy.\n&lt;section begin=R16-4 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-4 /&gt;\nJapan vs Croatia.\nThe teams had previously met three times, with a draw and a win for each side. Two of these encounters were in World Cup group stages: Croatia won 1–0 in 1998, and the teams drew 0–0 in 2006. The latter draw was the most recent encounter between the two.\nIn the 43rd minute, Daizen Maeda scored the opener for Japan with a low finish in the penalty area, after the ball was knocked back to him from the left. Ten minutes into the second half, Ivan Perišić equalised when he headed powerfully to the right corner of the net after a cross from Dejan Lovren on the right. The match saw no further goals scored either in the ninety minutes or during extra time and thus went to a penalty shoot-out. Japan missed three of their four penalties, with all three saved by goalkeeper Dominik Livaković. After Marko Livaja's effort struck the post, Mario Pašalić scored the winning spot kick with a low shot to the left, as Croatia won the shoot-out 3–1. Livaković became the third goalkeeper to make three saves in a World Cup shoot-out, after Ricardo for Portugal in 2006 and his fellow countryman Danijel Subašić in 2018.\n&lt;section begin=R16-5 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-5 /&gt;\nBrazil vs South Korea.\nThe teams had previously met seven times, with Brazil winning six and South Korea winning one of these encounters. The most recent meeting was in June 2022, a 5–1 friendly win for Brazil.\nVinícius Júnior opened the scoring for Brazil in the 7th minute, when he converted a side-footed shot to the right of the net past three Korean defenders on the line. Brazil were awarded a penalty six minutes later when Richarlison was fouled just inside the penalty area, which the returning Neymar scored with a low shot to the right corner of the goalkeeper, who didn't move. Richarlison made it 3–0 in the 29th minute when he controlled the ball with his head before receiving the ball back from Thiago Silva and passing into the left corner of the net. Lucas Paquetá got Brazil's fourth goal before half-time in the 36th minute, volleying low into the left corner of the net with his right foot after a cross from Vinícius Júnior on the left. In the second half, South Korea pulled a goal back when Paik Seung-ho finished into the right of the net from thirty yards out. With ten minutes left and leading by three goals, Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson was substituted for third-choice keeper Weverton, making Brazil the first team to ever use 26 different players play time in one World Cup.\nThe match was the last held at the Stadium 974 before its demolition.\n&lt;section begin=R16-6 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-6 /&gt;\nMorocco vs Spain.\nThe teams had met in three previous international matches, with two wins for Spain and one draw. Spain won both legs of the 1962 World Cup inter-continental play-off, while the sides' most recent meeting was a 2–2 draw in the 2018 World Cup group stage.\nAfter a goalless 120 minutes that were dominated in possession by Spain but saw few chances created, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Spain failed to convert any of their three attempts, with goalkeeper Yassine Bounou saving two of them from Sergio Busquets and Carlos Soler, and Pablo Sarabia hitting the post, whilst Morocco scored three out of four, including the winning penalty from Achraf Hakimi via a panenka kick in the middle of the goal, seeing Morocco progress to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in history.\nMorocco also became the first Arab country to reach the quarter-finals, and just the fourth African nation – after Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002, and Ghana in 2010 – to qualify for the last eight. Additionally, Morocco manager Walid Regragui became the first African and first Arab head coach to progress this far at a World Cup. Spain became just the second team to fail to convert a single attempt in a World Cup penalty shoot-out, after Switzerland lost to Ukraine in 2006 by exactly the same scoreline at the very same phase.\n&lt;section begin=R16-7 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-7 /&gt;\nPortugal vs Switzerland.\nThe teams had met 25 times, with nine wins for Portugal, eleven wins for Switzerland, and five draws. The sides faced off in several editions of World Cup qualification, including 1938, 1970, 1990, 1994, and 2018. Their most recent meeting was in June 2022, with Switzerland winning 1–0 in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A.\nCaptain Cristiano Ronaldo was left out of the starting line-up for Portugal – a first in major tournaments since their UEFA Euro 2008 group stage defeat, also against Switzerland – with Gonçalo Ramos named instead to make his first start.\nAfter Portugal took a 2–0 first-half lead via goals from Ramos and Pepe, Ramos would score a further two efforts – either side of goals by Raphaël Guerreiro (assisted by Ramos) and Swiss defender Manuel Akanji – in the second half to become the first hat-trick scorer of the 2022 World Cup, the first player to score a hat-trick on their debut World Cup start since Miroslav Klose in 2002, and the youngest World Cup hat-trick scorer since Flórián Albert in 1962. A late long-range strike from substitute Rafael Leão concluded a 6–1 Portuguese victory as they reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2006.\nThe result equalled Switzerland's 5–0 defeat to West Germany in 1966 as their biggest ever World Cup loss. In getting Portugal's second goal, Pepe became the oldest player to ever score in the World Cup knockout stage, and the second-oldest to have scored at any stage of the World Cup, behind only Roger Milla, who scored the consolation goal in Cameroon's thumping by the opposite scoreline in the 1994 group stage against Russia.\n&lt;section begin=R16-8 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-8 /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nCroatia vs Brazil.\nThe teams had met on four previous occasions, with three wins for Brazil and one draw. Two of these encounters took place in the World Cup group stage, with Brazil winning both matches: 1–0 in 2006 and 3–1 in 2014 (Brazil was hosting the World Cup at the time, with the victory being the opening match of that tournament).\nBrazil created the majority of the game's chances, forcing Croatian keeper Dominik Livaković into eleven saves, the most in a single match at the tournament. Early in the second half, a handball in the Croatian penalty area by Croatian defender Josip Juranović was dismissed by the referee after being deemed accidental. Following a scoreless ninety minutes, Neymar finally claimed the opener just before half-time of extra time with his 77th international goal, bringing him level with Péle as the nation's all-time top scorer; after receiving the ball back from Lucas Paquetá, Neymar rounded Livaković and shot high into the net from the right side of the penalty area. A defensive lapse then cost Brazil their lead, as Bruno Petković equalised for Croatia three minutes from the end; after picking out Mislav Oršić's cross on the left flank, he fired a shot into the corner of the net that took a deflection off the leg of Brazilian defender Marquinhos. This would be Croatia's only shot on target of the game. In the subsequent penalty shoot-out, Croatia scored all four of their attempts, while Brazil's first kicker Rodrygo had his shot saved by Livaković diving to his left, before Marquinhos hit his penalty low against the left post to confirm Brazil's elimination.\nCroatia qualified for their second successive World Cup semi-finals and their third ever, while Brazil exited the tournament at the hands of a European team for the fifth consecutive edition; their 2002 World Cup final triumph against Germany remained their last knockout stage win against European opposition. In the same period, Brazil was eliminated at the quarter-final stage in all four World Cup tournaments they played away from home, excluding a fourth-place finish at the 2014 tournament which they hosted.\n&lt;section begin=QF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF1 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Argentina.\nThis was the tenth meeting between the teams, continuing a historic rivalry among the two nations. The Netherlands had won four of the previous nine encounters, Argentina had won one, and the remaining four matches were draws. The sides had faced off five previous times in World Cup matches; a 4–0 win for the Dutch in the second group stage in 1974 was replied to with a 3–1 Argentine victory in the 1978 final. The Netherlands then won 2–1 in the 1998 quarter-finals, prior to goalless draws in the 2006 group stage and the 2014 semi-finals, with the Argentines winning the latter tie 4–2 on penalties.\nNahuel Molina opened the score for Argentina after 35 minutes, when he received a through ball in traffic from Lionel Messi and flicked it low past advancing goalkeeper Andries Noppert. In the 73rd minute, after Marcos Acuña had been fouled in the penalty area by Denzel Dumfries, Messi scored the resulting penalty to the right of the net to double Argentina's advantage. After being subbed on by the Netherlands in the 78th minute, Wout Weghorst pulled a goal back just five minutes later, converting a downward header via a cross on the right from Steven Berghuis. He then scored an equaliser in the eleventh minute of added time, when a late Dutch free kick on the edge of Argentina's penalty area was played by Teun Koopmeiners directly to Weghorst as he stood in a decoy wall, sending the match to extra time. Argentina controlled the majority of the thirty-minute period, which saw Enzo Fernández strike the post in its dying moments, but the sides could ultimately not be separated and thus entered a penalty shoot-out, just as they had in 2014.\nIn the shoot-out, Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez saved both of the Netherlands' first two attempts from Virgil van Dijk and Berghuis, as Argentina scored twice to earn a 2–0 advantage. After Fernández missed the chance to send his side through with their fourth penalty, Lautaro Martínez scored Argentina's subsequent spot kick to end the shoot-out 4–3 in their favour and progress to the semi-finals.\nThere were a number of contested incidents between the sides both during and after the match that garnered much discussion. Players clashed on multiple occasions across the contest, during both regulation and the subsequent shoot-out. Messi was also involved in confrontations with Dutch manager Louis van Gaal and an unwanted encounter with Weghorst during his post-match interview.\nIn total, the match saw a total of eighteen yellow cards brandished, breaking the World Cup record of sixteen that was set in another Dutch knockout defeat, their infamous round of 16 game against Portugal in 2006 (in addition to the seventeen yellow cards shown in the player lineups below, Walter Samuel of Argentina's coaching staff was shown a yellow card in the 31st minute). Spanish referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz received criticism for his failure to control the match, with many fans and media outlets considering his yellow cards to be too lenient for some instances that could have seen players sent off, while other incidents were ignored altogether. The amount of yellows issued by Mateu Lahoz was also criticised.\nBecause of these events, the match has been referred to as the Battle of Lusail, in reference to the aforementioned 2006 contest between Portugal and the Netherlands that had been dubbed \"The Battle of Nuremberg\".\nThe match was also marred by the controversial death of American sportswriter Grant Wahl after he collapsed near the end of the match while watching in the press box. \n&lt;section begin=QF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF2 /&gt;\nMorocco vs Portugal.\nThe teams had met twice before, both during the World Cup group stage, with both sides winning one match: Morocco won 3–1 in 1986, while Portugal prevailed 1–0 in 2018.\nIn the first half, Youssef En-Nesyri would put Morocco in front after 42 minutes when he jumped highest from a Yahia Attiyat Allah cross to head past advancing goalkeeper Diogo Costa and into the empty net, followed by Bruno Fernandes' attempted equaliser just before half-time striking the bar from long range. Portugal subbed on Cristiano Ronaldo in the second half, which saw him equal the record of 196 international caps set by Bader Al-Mutawa. Despite late Portuguese chances from João Félix, Ronaldo and Pepe, and the dismissal of Moroccan defender Walid Cheddira following two yellow cards in quick succession, Morocco would hold on to win 1–0.\nWith their victory, Morocco became both the first African and first Arab country to reach the World Cup semi-finals, as well as the second Muslim-majority country after Turkey in 2002 to qualify for the last four. This was also the first time a nation not located in Europe and South America reached this stage since South Korea did so, also in 2002.\n&lt;section begin=QF3 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF3 /&gt;\nEngland vs France.\nThe teams had previously met 31 times, with 17 wins for England, nine wins for France and five draws. Two of these meetings took place during the World Cup, with England winning on both occasions: they defeated France 2–0 in the 1966 group stage and 3–1 in the 1982 first group stage. The sides most recently met in a friendly in June 2017, with France winning 3–2.\nAurélien Tchouaméni opened the scoring for France in the 17th minute, with a shot from outside the penalty area to the left corner which beat England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford diving down to his right. Several pundits questioned the goal because England's Bukayo Saka had been brought to the ground, allowing France to win possession, in the build-up to the opener. Some claimed it was a clear foul, while others, including British journalists, thought the contact was not clear enough for the VAR to overturn the on-pitch decision. Early in the second half, England were awarded a penalty after Tchouaméni fouled Saka inside the area. Harry Kane scored from the spot against his club teammate Hugo Lloris, shooting to the left, which put Kane level with Wayne Rooney as England's all-time top scorer at 53 goals. Just moments after seeing his volley saved by Pickford, Olivier Giroud, who himself entered the match as France's all-time top scorer, also scored his 53rd international goal twelve minutes from time, with a header to the left of the net after a cross from Antoine Griezmann. In the 84th minute, the VAR awarded England a second penalty after English substitute Mason Mount was seen being pushed over in the area by Théo Hernandez. Kane again took the spot kick but this time shot over the bar, as France held on to win 2–1 and progress to the last four, while England were eliminated in the World Cup quarter-finals for a record seventh time.\nFrance became the first reigning world champions to reach the World Cup semi-finals since Brazil in 1998, whom France would beat in that year's final. France's passage to the semi-finals along with Croatia's, the side they defeated in the 2018 final, marked the first time that both teams from a World Cup final reached the last four of the subsequent tournament since Argentina and West Germany in 1990.\n&lt;section begin=QF4 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nArgentina vs Croatia.\nThe teams had met five times before, each side winning twice and drawing once. Two of these matches took place in the World Cup group stage: a 1–0 win for Argentina in 1998 was followed by Croatia's 3–0 victory in 2018.\nBoth sides kept a cautious approach in the match's opening half hour, until Croatian defenders Dejan Lovren and Joško Gvardiol mistakenly let Julián Álvarez pass through the defence in the 32nd minute, leading to goalkeeper Dominik Livaković colliding with Álvarez. Referee Daniele Orsato booked Livaković and awarded a penalty kick to Argentina, which Lionel Messi converted high into the top right corner of the goal. The collision also sparked a feud between Orsato and some Croatia players, causing Mateo Kovačić to be booked and the sending off of assistant coach Mario Mandžukić. In the 39th minute, Álvarez ran through several Croatian defenders and scored Argentina's second goal. In the second half of the match, Croatian coach Zlatko Dalić substituted off five players, including team captain Luka Modrić, in order to boost the attacking ability of the team, but this didn't stop Messi and Álvarez from providing another goal for the Argentinians; in the 69th minute, Messi twisted past Gvardiol on the byline before teeing the ball up to Álvarez in the center, enabling Álvarez to score his second goal. The match ended in a 3–0 victory for Argentina, a reversal of the scoreline from their 2018 encounter.\nMessi's goal from the penalty spot was his eleventh at a World Cup, taking him ahead of Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's most prolific goalscorer in the competition. Messi also drew level with former German midfielder Lothar Matthäus's record of 25 matches played in World Cup finals.\n&lt;section begin=SF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF1 /&gt;\nFrance vs Morocco.\nThe teams had previously met seven times, with France winning five matches and the other two being draws. Their most recent encounter was a friendly in 2007, ending in a 2–2 stalemate. This was the first World Cup meeting between the sides. The match marked the first ever World Cup semi-final featuring either an African or Arab country, and just the third time that a team from a confederation outside Europe and South America played at this stage, after the United States in 1930 and South Korea in 2002.\nThéo Hernandez would give France an early lead in the fifth minute, netting an acrobatic volley from a tight angle on the left after Kylian Mbappé's shot was diverted into his path. Hernandez's goal, timed at four minutes and 39 seconds, was the fastest in a World Cup semi-final since Vavá netted in the second minute of Brazil's 5–2 win against France in 1958. It was also just the second goal Morocco had conceded at the tournament and the first since the group stage. Olivier Giroud would hit the post for France, before Moroccan captain Romain Saïss was forced to withdraw after 21 minutes, having been a doubt to start the match after going off injured in the quarter-finals. Morocco would then nearly equalise right before half-time, after Jawad El Yamiq saw his overhead kick strike the post and be cleared away. Despite being in possession of the ball for the majority of the contest, Morocco were not rewarded for this pressure, and after Mbappé dribbled into the penalty area in the 79th minute, his ball would find Randal Kolo Muani, who scored his first-ever goal for France with his first touch of the game to double their advantage, having come on as a substitute 44 seconds prior.\nFrance's 2–0 victory set up a final against Argentina, putting them one win away from becoming the first nation to successfully defend the World Cup since Brazil won the 1958 and 1962 editions.\n&lt;section begin=SF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nThe teams had previously faced each other twice, including their opening game in Group F at this World Cup, which ended 0–0. This marked the second consecutive World Cup where the teams playing in the third place match also played each other in the group stage, following Belgium vs England in 2018.\nCroatia went in front with an early goal, after defender Joško Gvardiol diverted a diving header into the top left corner of the net in the seventh minute, assisted via a headed pass from Ivan Perišić. Croatia's lead would only last two minutes; Morocco's Achraf Dari received the ball after a Hakim Ziyech free kick struck the Croatian wall, and levelled the score in the ninth minute with a close-range header, having been left unmarked in front of the net. However, the managed to regain the lead shortly before half-time through Mislav Oršić, who shot a long-range bending strike from just inside the penalty area on the left, hitting the inside of the post before the ball nestled in the back of the net. Although Croatian keeper Dominik Livaković was forced into a smothering save at close range to deny Morocco's Youssef En-Nesyri, the second half saw no further goals scored, handing Croatia a third-place finish at the World Cup for the second time, following the one achieved in 1998.\nThis was the eleventh consecutive World Cup in which a European team finished third, dating back to 1982. Despite the defeat, a fourth-place finish still signified Morocco's (and also Africa's) best ever World Cup achievement; they won more matches in the 2022 edition than in their first five World Cup appearances combined.\n&lt;section begin=TPP /&gt;&lt;section end=TPP /&gt;\nFinal.\nThe teams had met on twelve previous occasions, with Argentina winning six matches, France three, and the other three ending in draws. The sides had faced each other three times in the World Cup, with two of these encounters coming in the group stage: Argentina won 1–0 in 1930 (their World Cup debut) and 2–1 in 1978, while their most recent World Cup meeting was France's 4–3 victory in the 2018 round of 16, their first defeat of Argentina since 1986.\nBoth teams were seeking to win a third World Cup title. France were the first title holders to play in the final since Brazil, whom France defeated as hosts in 1998, and were aiming to become the first nation to retain the World Cup since Brazil's victories in 1958 and 1962. French coach Didier Deschamps was attempting to become the second manager to win multiple World Cup titles, and the first since Vittorio Pozzo in 1934 and 1938 with Italy. Argentina, who had been defeated by Germany in both of their previous two trips to the final (in 1990 and 2014), were looking for a first world title in 36 years, having last won the competition in 1986.\nFollowing a dominant first half that saw Argentina go up 2–0 thanks to a Lionel Messi penalty and a goal from Ángel Di María, they were suddenly caught out late into the second period with two goals in two minutes for France from Kylian Mbappé. After the match headed to extra time, Messi would score his second to regain Argentina's lead, only for Mbappé to again equalise two minutes from time via his second penalty, making him the first player since Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final. Adding on to the one he claimed in 2018, Mbappé also became the first player to score four World Cup final goals, as well as the first player to reach eight goals in a single World Cup since Ronaldo for winners Brazil in 2002. However, Mbappé failed to emulate Hurst's and Ronaldo's successes; despite him scoring the first attempt for France, they lost 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out after Kingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni failed to convert their efforts, with Gonzalo Montiel's spot kick sealing Argentina's victory.\nArgentina achieved their third world title, surpassing France and Uruguay's totals. They also became the first non-European side to win the title since Brazil in 2002, the previous occasion that the World Cup was held in Asia. France's loss was their second in a World Cup final, having been defeated by Italy in 2006, a match which was also decided by penalties. Many reporters, pundits and fans regarded the match as the greatest FIFA World Cup final of all time.\nBoth the tournament and the final itself saw Messi break multiple World Cup records. The match, which was his 26th overall in World Cup finals, saw him surpass Lothar Matthäus as the player with the most appearances in the competition. His goals against France also made him the first player to score in all five rounds of a World Cup since the group stage to round of 16 format was introduced in 1986. Messi was subsequently named the final's official Player of the Match, before being awarded the Golden Ball for best player of the tournament. His five Player of the Match titles in 2022 were the most ever won at a single World Cup by a player since their introduction in 2002, and his Golden Ball award made him the first player to claim the accolade in multiple World Cups, having done so previously in 2014."

        "text": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. With a record 1.5 billion people watching on television, the final became one of the most widely watched televised sporting events in history.\nThe tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2–1, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2–0. They then beat Australia 2–1 in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out after it ended 2–2 in extra time and Croatia in the semi-final 3–0. France finished first in Group D with two wins and one loss (4–1 win over Australia, 2–1 win over Denmark, and a 1–0 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland 3–1 in the round of 16, England 2–1 in the quarter-final and Morocco 2–0 in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 88,966 spectators and was refereed by Szymon Marciniak.\nArgentina took the lead through a penalty by Lionel Messi in the 23rd minute before Ángel Di María further increased their lead in the 36th minute with a low shot into the corner of the goal after a sweeping Argentina counterattack. France failed to register a shot at the goal for the vast majority of the match until a 97-second brace by Kylian Mbappé tied the game 2–2 in the 81st minute. During extra time, Messi then scored again to give Argentina a 3–2 lead. However, Mbappé scored a second penalty to tie the game 3–3 with only minutes remaining, becoming the second man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final after Geoff Hurst in 1966. Argentina then won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to win their third World Cup, and first since 1986.\nIt was the second time that Argentina reached the World Cup final after losing their opening match (the other occasion being in 1990), a feat three other teams have achieved (West Germany in 1982, Italy in 1994, and Spain in 2010); it was only the second time in history that a team went on to win the tournament after losing their opening match (following Spain in 2010). France became the first team in history to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose. Messi was named the man of the match and won the Golden Ball as FIFA's best player of the tournament. The match was ranked by pundits and fans alike as one of the greatest World Cup finals, and one of the greatest matches in the history of the sport.\nBackground.\nArgentina had won the World Cup twice before, in 1978 and 1986. They had also finished as losing finalists thrice, in 1930, 1990 and 2014. After the 2014 final loss, they went on to lose two consecutive Copa América finals to Chile, in 2015 and 2016. After a string of disappointing performances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to eventual champions France in the first knockout round, and the 2019 Copa América, where they finished third, newly appointed coach Lionel Scaloni led Argentina to their first international title since the 1993 Copa América: Argentina defeated Brazil 1–0 in the 2021 Copa América Final, handing captain Lionel Messi his first international title with Argentina. After winning the 2022 Finalissima, beating European champions Italy 3–0, Argentina entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.\nFrance were the defending champions from the 2018 World Cup, which made this the first time since the 2002 final in which a team had consecutive appearances at the finals, and the first since 1998 in which the title holders qualified for the subsequent final – both feats achieved by Brazil. France had claimed two World Cups, in 1998 and 2018. The French also reached the 2006 final, but fell to Italy on penalties. Under the management of Didier Deschamps, who won the 1998 tournament as a player, the French failed to conquer the 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euros 2016 and 2020, but successfully clinched the 2018 World Cup title. Due to their status as the world champions, France also entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win. France aimed to emulate the achievement of Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 as the third country to successfully defend the World Cup title. Deschamps was seeking to become the second manager to win two men's FIFA World Cup titles, after Vittorio Pozzo with Italy in 1934 and 1938. Having won the 1998 tournament as a player, Deschamps was also seeking to become the third person to win three FIFA World Cup titles, after Brazilian legends Pelé (all as a player) and Mário Zagallo (two as a player, one as a manager).\nThe two nations met in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup. In 2018 in Russia at the Kazan Arena in the round of 16, France won the encounter 4–3 in what \"The Independent\" called \"one of the greatest World Cup games of all time\". Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's volley outside of the box – which was later voted as the goal of the tournament – and then Kylian Mbappé twice. Sergio Agüero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.\nThe match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022. It was a variation of the Adidas \"Al Rihla\" used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas \"Al-Hilm\", meaning \"The Dream\" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup. Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the \"Al-Rihla\" balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a \"Gold Metallic\", maroon, \"Collegiate Burgundy\", and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy. It is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin, Jo'bulani, Brazuca Final Rio, and Telstar Mechta.\nVenue.\nThe final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about north of the city centre of Doha. The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid, and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020. The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.\nLusail Stadium, owned by the Qatar Football Association, was built as part of Qatar's winning bid for the World Cup. The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous, supported by MANICA Architecture. The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint. Construction began in April 2017, and was planned to finish in 2020. Completion of the stadium was postponed, with construction ultimately finished in November 2021. The stadium hosted its first match, the Lusail Super Cup, on 9 September 2022, later than expected.\nRoute to the final.\nArgentina.\nDrawn in group C and coming off a three-year, 36-game-long unbeaten streak, Argentina were defeated in their opening game 2–1 by Saudi Arabia. Lionel Messi's opener from the penalty spot was followed by several disallowed Argentina goals which were ruled offside. Immediately after half-time, Saudi Arabia stunned Argentina with two goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari in a span of five minutes before shutting out any further attempts by the South Americans in a disciplined defensive performance. However, the Argentines bounced back from the shock loss to overcome Mexico 2–0 after a long-range effort by Messi who then assisted Enzo Fernández for the second, reigniting their World Cup hopes. Boosted by the win, Argentina then beat Poland with the same scoreline with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez despite a first-half penalty miss from Messi, taking first place in Group C and condemning both Mexico and Saudi Arabia to World Cup elimination.\nIn the round of 16, the Argentines found themselves matched against group D runners-up Australia; Messi's first-ever knockout-stage goal was followed by an astute goal by Álvarez, who intercepted Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to finish into an empty net as Argentina overcame Australia 2–1, despite an own goal from Fernández creating a frantic finish which required a late save from point-blank range by Emiliano Martínez. Continuing a rivalry, they proceed to square off against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. In a controversial match noted for its dramatic nature, chaotic atmosphere, and fury between both teams, it saw Argentina lead by two goals coming from Nahuel Molina and a penalty from Messi, but succumbed to two late goals by Wout Weghorst as regulation time ended 2–2 after 90 minutes; neither could find the breakthrough in extra time and penalties were used to decide the winner. Emiliano Martínez saved the first two Dutch penalties from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis, while only Fernández missed for Argentina as Lautaro Martínez scored the decisive last kick of the game, a result reminiscent of their 2014 most recent, also knockout stage meeting and sending them through the semi-finals, as they meet 2018 runners up Croatia. In a rematch of the 2018 encounter when Croatia had won 3–0, Argentina decisively beat Croatia by the same scoreline. Lionel Messi scored a first-half penalty before Álvarez scored a solo effort five minutes later. Messi then assisted Álvarez for his double in the second half, as Argentina booked their place in the final for the second time in eight years.\nFrance.\nFrance started their World Cup campaign as the defending world champions, having won the most recent tournament in Russia, and was drawn in group D. Their first meeting was against AFC representative Australia. The French suffered a shock deficit after nine minutes due to a goal by Craig Goodwin, but were able to stage a comeback with a double from Olivier Giroud together with goals from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappé to win 4–1. Empowered by the win, France overcame a highly organised and threatening Denmark side with Mbappé striking twice in the second half, despite conceding an equaliser from Andreas Christensen. France won 2–1 and became the first team to progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup in Qatar and the first European world champions to do so since 1994. With progression assured, France rotated most of their team, resting their key players for the final game against a desperate Tunisia; France resultantly lost 1–0 courtesy of a goal by French-born Wahbi Khazri before having an equaliser by Antoine Griezmann disallowed. France maintained top of the group due to a superior goal difference over Australia.\nIn the round of 16, France overcame group C runners-up Poland 3–1 with goals from Giroud and Mbappé, despite conceding a late penalty from Robert Lewandowski. The quarter-finals saw France battling old rivals England in a tense match, with France defeating England 2–1 with goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Giroud; England found an equaliser for 1–1 courtesy of a penalty by Harry Kane but a second penalty to equalise the game was missed by Kane, granting France a place in the semi-finals. France then faced the biggest underdog of the tournament, Morocco, who had beaten both Iberian representatives Spain and Portugal in the process; the French were able to end the history-making run by the African nation with two goals from Théo Hernandez and Randal Kolo Muani. France reached their second consecutive World Cup final for the first time in their history.\nPre-match.\nPolish referee Szymon Marciniak was named as the referee of the final on 15 December 2022, with fellow Poles Paweł Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz appointed as assistant referees. Marciniak became a FIFA referee in 2011 and had previously served as a referee at the UEFA Euro 2016 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, as well as during the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. Earlier in the tournament, Marciniak officiated the France–Denmark group stage game, as well as the Argentina–Australia match in the round of 16. It was the first time that a Polish referee led the team of officials at a World Cup final, and the second time that a Polish referee was included among the officials during such a match, after Michał Listkiewicz (father of Marciniak's assistant Tomasz) served as a linesman during the 1990 FIFA World Cup final.\nIsmail Elfath and Kathryn Nesbitt of the United States were appointed as fourth official and reserve assistant referee, respectively, while another Pole, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, led the video assistant referee team. Venezuelan Juan Soto served as assistant video assistant referee, American Kyle Atkins was the offside video assistant referee, and the role of support video assistant referee was assigned to Mexican Fernando Guerrero. German Bastian Dankert and American Corey Parker served as stand-by video assistant referee and stand-by assistant video assistant referee, respectively.\nSeveral heads of state were in attendance, among them Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and French president Emmanuel Macron. Various members of the FIFA Council and FIFA president Gianni Infantino were also in attendance. Argentine head of state Alberto Fernández did not attend after having reportedly refused to travel to Qatar due to potential political backlash. However, Chiqui Tapia, the President of the Argentine Football Association was present in the final.\nThe tournament's closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match; it featured a collaboration between Puerto Rican singer Ozuna and French singer Gims. Also performing were Nora Fatehi, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Manal.\nThe winners trophy was unveiled by World Cup winning captain Iker Casillas and Indian actress Deepika Padukone.\nArgentine singer Lali Espósito sang the \"Argentine National Anthem\" and Egyptian mezzo-soprano Farrah Eldibany sang the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise\", before the match.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nFrance kicked off the match at 18:00 local time (15:00 ) in front of a crowd of 88,966. Argentina were awarded a penalty in the 23rd minute when Ángel Di María was fouled in the penalty area by Ousmane Dembélé as Di María cut in from the left. Lionel Messi scored the penalty with a low shot to the right corner. In the 36th minute, Di Maria finished a sweeping Argentina counter-attack to make it 2–0, shooting with his left foot over the goalkeeper to the right corner of the net after a pass from Alexis Mac Allister from the right. France made two early substitutions near the end of the first half and went into half-time trailing 0–2.\nSecond half.\nArgentina were on course for the win, controlling possession, and defensively shutting down France, who failed to make an attempt on goal until the 80th minute, at which point France was awarded a penalty after Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Kylian Mbappé scored the penalty low to the left corner, despite Emiliano Martínez getting a hand on the ball, making the game 2–1. 97 seconds later, Kingsley Coman tackled Messi right as the game restarted, starting a rapid counter-attack which finished with Mbappé first-time volleying a lofted pass from Marcus Thuram with his right foot as he was falling to the ground to the bottom-right corner of the net to make the game 2–2; Martínez again attempted to parry the ball but couldn't keep it out. Five minutes after Mbappé's equalizer, Thuram went down in the penalty box after slightly tripping on Enzo Fernández's leg, only to be booked for diving. Both teams came close to finishing the game near the end of added time as Adrien Rabiot fired a quick shot inside the box, forcing a fumbling save from Emiliano Martínez; then three minutes later Messi had a hard shot parried over the bar by Hugo Lloris. With the score tied at the end of regulation time, the match went to extra time.\nExtra time.\nAfter first half of extra time finished goalless, notably highlighted by two one-on-one opportunities missed by Lautaro Martínez, Messi scored again for Argentina in the second period of extra time when he finished from close range after Lloris had parried a shot from Lautaro Martínez on the right, in what seemed to be the winning goal. However, France was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after a shot by Mbappé hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal with his penalty kick to the left, sending Martínez the wrong way and becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in a men's World Cup final after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966. In the 123rd minute, with 15 seconds of the extra time to spare, a loose ball fell to an unmarked Kolo Muani at the edge of the box, who shot low to the right of the goal; however, Emiliano Martínez blocked the shot with his left shin. Argentina counter-attacked immediately, ending with Lautaro Martínez heading wide of the goal from 10 yards. France produced one last attack when Mbappé dribbled in the penalty box, passing three Argentina defenders, only for Paulo Dybala to make a timely clearance off the field. The referee then blew the final whistle of extra time and the match went to a penalty shoot-out.\nPenalty shoot-out.\nThis was the third time the World Cup final would be decided on penalties. Mbappé and Messi successfully converted the first two attempts to begin the penalty shootout at 1–1. Argentina goalkeeper Martínez would continue to use the psychological tactics and means of gamesmanship that he utilized during the penalty shoot-outs in the quarter-final against the Netherlands. After delaying Kingsley Coman's attempt by arguing with the referee, Martínez then saved Coman's shot, which was down low to Martínez's right. Dybala sent a shot into the net up the middle to give Argentina a 2–1 lead. Before Aurélien Tchouaméni's shot, Martínez picked up the ball and then threw it to the edge of the box. Tchouaméni then sent his shot wide of the goal to the left. Leandro Paredes then scored to put France on the brink of defeat at 3–1. Kolo Muani kept France alive by scoring his chance and reducing France's deficit to 3–2; Martínez attempted to use his psychological tactics on Kolo Muani but was instead shown a yellow card. Montiel was then given a chance to make up for his late handball by clinching the championship for Argentina. Montiel scored low to the left, securing the 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory for Argentina and giving them their third World Cup trophy and first since 1986.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Line-ups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match and legacy.\nPundits, commentators, and audiences praised the intensity, stressful atmosphere, and thrilling back-and-forth nature of the match, highlighting the number of goals scored, and with many media outlets spotlighting it as a duel between Paris Saint-Germain teammates Messi and Mbappé. The match has since been hailed as one of the most exciting World Cup finals, and among the greatest football matches ever.\nWith the victory, Argentina won their third FIFA World Cup title to surpass France and Uruguay, their titles ranking behind only Brazil's five and the four of Italy and Germany. They became the first South American and first non-European side to win the World Cup since Brazil in 2002, and the first reigning champions of the Copa América to win the World Cup. Having won on penalties against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, Argentina became the first team to have won on that method twice en route to the title. It was the tenth World Cup title for a South American side, and the eighth South American victory in eleven finals facing European opposition. France became the third defending champions to lose in the following final, after Argentina in 1990 and Brazil in 1998. The match was the third FIFA World Cup final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out, after 1994 and 2006, the latter of which France also lost to Italy. This meant that France have never won on penalties in all competitions since the 1998 World Cup quarter-final against Italy. The six goals in the final brought the total number of goals in the tournament to a record 172, surpassing the 171 goals scored in 1998 and 2014.\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino was present on the pitch stage during the awards ceremony to hand out the medals and present the trophy to the Argentine captain Lionel Messi. He was joined by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, French president Emmanuel Macron, Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia, French Football Federation president Noël Le Graët, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin. Sergio Batista and Nery Pumpido, World Cup winners with Argentina in 1986, brought the trophy onto the pitch for the ceremony. Before being presented with the trophy by the Emir and Infantino, Messi was given a bisht to wear by the Emir prior to the trophy celebration. The trophy presentation had scenery unlike previous tournaments, with confetti replaced by pyrotechnics and lights with a backdrop of some orchestral cinematic music.\nMessi was named as the player of the match and won his second Golden Ball award after 2014 as the best player of the tournament, becoming the first (and so far only) player to receive the award twice. He also won the Silver Boot award with the second-most goals at the tournament, seven. Messi's appearance in the final, his 26th World Cup game, meant he surpassed Lothar Matthäus as the player with the most appearances in the World Cup. With his goals, Messi became the second player to score in the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a World Cup tournament, after Hungary's György Sárosi in 1938, and the only player to score in all of those knockout rounds as well as the group stage. Having scored once in the previous final, Mbappé's hat-trick made him the highest-scoring player in the final of the World Cup with four goals, surpassing the three of Hurst, Pelé, Vavá and Zinedine Zidane. In addition, with his three goals, he surpassed Messi to win the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals, the most in a World Cup since Brazil's Ronaldo in 2002, and also was awarded the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the World Cup. Argentina's Emiliano Martínez won the Golden Glove award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, while his teammate Enzo Fernández won the Young Player Award as the best player at the World Cup who is at most 21 (born on or after 1 January 2001).\nIn Argentina, celebrations erupted across the country, most notably in the capital Buenos Aires and in Rosario, Messi's hometown. On 20 December, the celebration in the streets of Buenos Aires after the arrival of the players of Argentina gathered a crowd estimated by local media at over four million people, forcing the team to be airlifted by helicopter out of their bus. On 22 December, the French Football Federation confirmed to have lodged a formal complaint against the Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez for unsporting behaviour which included incidents such as a sarcastic prayer for silence for French forward Kylian Mbappé in the Argentine locker room after the match, as well as being seen holding and laughing at a toy with a facial cut of Mbappé's face stuck to it during the Argentine victory parade. In France, riots erupted across the country in cities including Paris, Lyon and Nice; these were very similar to those after their victory in 2018, as well as after victories against England and Morocco earlier in the tournament. Some French players like Kingsley Coman, Randal Kolo Muani and Aurélien Tchouaméni were racially abused online due to their performances by their own fans. Within 48 hours of Messi posting, the Instagram post with the World Cup trophy had surpassed 75 million likes, and in doing so, it became the most-liked social media post ever across all social media platforms surpassing the previous most-liked Instagram post, the world record egg."

        "text": "Sri Lanka competed at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England from 28 July to 8 August 2022. This was Sri Lanka's 17th appearance at the Commonwealth Games.\nOn June 30, 2022 the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka announced a team of 114 athletes (54 men and 60 women). For the first time ever, more women will compete than men. On July 19, 2022, the table tennis team of four male athletes was withdrawn, meaning the final team size was 50 men and 60 women (110 total athletes) competing in 13 sports.\nWeightlifter Indika Dissanayake and cricketer Chamari Athapaththu were the country's flagbearers during the opening ceremony.\nSri Lanka finished the competition with four medals (one silver and three bronze), ranking the country 31st overall on the medal table.

Abeykoon also became the first Sri Lankan to win a Commonwealth Games medal in either men's and women's 100m event. During the heats, Abeykoon managed to set an all-time fastest ever timing in Commonwealth Games history in the heats after finishing with a timing of 10.06 seconds. The previous record in 100m men's heats record was held by Canada's Glenroy Gilbert who had finished his heat with a timing of 10.10 seconds during the 1994 Commonwealth Games. His timing of 10.06 seconds earned him a spot in the semi-finals. Yupun finished with a timing of 10.20 seconds semi-final which helped him to secure a berth into the final and was also the only Asian athlete to qualify for the final.\nPalitha Bandara claimed a silver medal in men's F42-44/61-64 discus throw final after clearing a distance of 44.20 meters garnering 944 points.

        "title": "1988 Winter Olympics opening ceremony",
        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 1988 Winter Olympics was held on February 13, 1988, beginning at 1:30 p.m. MST (16:30 UTC, February 13) at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nThe event was officially opened by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. An audience of 60,000 spectators was in attendance at the venue, with 2,600 athletes and officials.\nPreparations.\nPlanning for the opening ceremony was trusted to the head of the volunteer ceremonies committee Eddie Rogers. Rogers had previously planned the \"Calgary Stampede's\" grandstand shows. Rogers hired Paddy Sampson, a former CBC employee as the executive producer of the ceremonies. Sampson had much of the music used in the games recorded in Calgary, and had Tommy Banks brought in to direct the composition for the parade of athletes. Sampson found volunteers for the country-western dancing by scouring country and western bars in Southern Calgary, and asking strong dancers to volunteer for the opening ceremonies.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympic opening ceremonies were orchestrated different than previous ceremonies. Previously, the parade of athletes took place partway through the ceremonies, stand during parts of the ceremony, and athletes departed prior to the end of the ceremonies. Calgary organizers wanted the athletes to parade as early as possible, be seated to watch the most of the ceremony, and leave closer to the end of the event. This was intended to allow the athletes to watch the ceremony which was essentially held in honour of their participation in the Games.\nThe Calgary organizers wanted the audience to be part of the visual spectacle, and provided each spectator with a coloured poncho to wear. The ponchos were paid for by Coca-Cola, but after realizing the IOC's restriction on sponsorships during the opening ceremonies, the organizers sent the ponchos to a nearby prison where inmates were tasked with flipping the 62,000 ponchos inside-out and removing the labels. Several of the ponchos were defaced by inmates with obscenities and other statements, leading organizers to sort through the ponchos to remove the offensive garments and order replacements.\nIn preparations for the opening and closing ceremonies, temporary bleachers were installed in McMahon Stadium to increase the seated occupancy capacity to 60,000. The Olympic cauldron was constructed out of copper with platforms created to hold the flame, a 65-meter teepee was built behind the cauldron.\nApproximately 8,000 volunteers were brought on to perform in the opening ceremonies, led by eight choreographers and one artistic director. Rehearsals began for most volunteers 12 weeks in advance of the ceremonies and took place on average twice a week.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympics were the first for many years to enforce the Olympic Charter rule limiting the attendance of the Opening Ceremony Parade to only athletes and four officials per team. Each team was provided marching passes which allowed access for athletes and four additional passes for officials on February 11. OCO'88 notes that some teams traded their marching passes to other teams who wanted more than four officials to participate in the opening ceremony.\nDuring the opening ceremonies, 850 pigeons were released at McMahon Stadium. The temperature prior to the opening ceremonies was , with a brisk wind.\nProgram.\nThe opening ceremonies began with a choir of 1,100 singers from Across Alberta singing the theme song of the 1988 Games, \"Come Together\". Following the song, more than 700 performers from 40 cultural groups participated in a salute to the Olympics, including the Calgary Stampede Showband and five First Nations. Afterwards the flags of the 57 participating nations were raised by Canadian Cadets, and the Governor General Jeanne Sauvé arrived and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police performed a short version of their \"Musical Ride\".\nThe parade of athletes began with competitors entering from the North end of McMahon Stadium and circling around the field. National teams entered in alphabetical order based on their nation's name in English, as the host nation, Canada was the last team to enter, led by flag-bearer and figure skater Brian Orser. A western two-step dance with 360 dancers followed with live music provided by Ian Tyson and Gordon Lightfoot singing \"Four Strong Winds\" and \"Alberta Bound\".\nThe official opening began with OCO'88 Chairman Frank King introducing IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, followed by King giving a welcome speech, then Samaranch, followed by Sauvé declaring the Games officially open on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. Afterwards 1,100 Calgary children gave a performance illustrating the Olympic sports.\nA flag exchange occurred with representatives from Oslo, and the Olympic torch was carried into the stadium by Cathy Priestner and Ken Read, they momentarily shared the flame with wheelchair Olympian Rick Hansen, and handed off to 12-year-old Robyn Perry, a figure skater, to light the Olympic flame. As the flame illuminated, a flyover by the Canadian Air Force Snowbirds filled the sky with coloured smoke representing the five colours of the Olympic Games.\nGilles Vigneault's \"Mon Pays\" played as a celebration of Canadian bilingual culture, followed by the administration of the Olympic Oaths, and singing of \"O Canada\". The opening ceremony ended with performers, athletes and spectators singing a recital of \"Can't You Feel It\", a song composed by Canadian David Foster for the Games."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 1988 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "A number of notable controversies and concerns associated with the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, emerged which were the subject of public debate and media commentary.\nSafety.\nDeath of Joerg Oberhammer.\nOn February 25, 1988, 47 year old Austrian Olympic Team physician Joerg Oberhammer died after falling into the path of a snow-grooming machine after colliding with another skier between runs of the men's giant slalom. Swiss team skiers Pirmin Zurbriggen and Martin Hangl witnessed Oberhammer's death from the chairlift, Zurbriggen went on to win a gold medal, while Hangl withdrew from the giant slalom due to the incident.\nEnvironmental.\nWeather.\nThe weather conditions for the 1988 Winter Olympics were a significant problem, with temperatures ranging from . Of the 176 events scheduled for the 1988 Games, 30 were postponed and rescheduled due to inclement weather. The men's downhill skiing event at Nakiska was postponed for one day, due to Chinook winds blowing up to 160 km/h. The women's downhill event also experienced the same scenario. With the ski jumping venue facing north at Canada Olympic Park (COP), the same winds also disrupted those events, with the large hill event being postponed four times. It had also disrupted the Nordic combined events, in which the ski jumping part had to be postponed as well. For the first time in Olympic history, both the ski jumping and Nordic combined cross-country skiing events was contested in a single day.\nDespite using artificial cooling, the bobsleigh and luge events at COP was not spared, with several races being postponed due to the high temperatures during that time. During the Two-man Bobsleigh, sand and dust particles ended up being deposited onto the artificial track by Chinook winds, resulting in a noticeably faster track for later participants. The Soviet Union's two man bobsleigh team won gold after an unexpected come-from-behind win over the heavy favourite East German teams.\nThe high on February 26, 1988, in Calgary reached , an all-time record high for the city on that day.\nDoping.\nThe drug testing laboratory for the 1988 Winter Olympic Games was installed at Foothills Hospital and accredited by the IOC Medical Commission in December 1987. During the games a total of 428 urine samples were tested for banned substances, with one competitor testing positive for testosterone, and five hidden control samples correctly identified by the laboratory. The laboratory tested for five classes of drugs, stimulants, narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids, β-blockers, and diuretics, as well as the masking agent probenecid.\nIce hockey.\nPolish ice-hockey player Jarosław Morawiecki tested positive for the banned substance Testosterone during the Games. The 23 year old centre, who was considered Poland's best player, exceeded the allowable limit of testosterone in random testing after a match which saw Poland defeat France 6–2. Polish coach Leszek Lejczyk claimed Morawiecki was deliberately drugged for political reasons.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned Morawiecki from competition for 18 months and invalidated Poland's victory in the France match. Poland finished 5th of 6th in the tournament Group A standings.\nNordic Skiing.\nPrior to the 1988 Winter Olympics, American Nordic combined skier Kerry Lynch admitted to taking illegal blood transfusions under the guidance of coach Jim Page prior to the 1987 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships where he finished 2nd in the 15 km individual event. FIS subsequently suspended Lynch for two years which included the 1988 Games. During the 1988 Games, Canadian Nordic skiing coach Martin Hall alleged the Soviet Union's success was a result of blood doping. The national ski federations of Finland, Norway and Sweden later demanded blood doping tests be carried out in future Nordic skiing events.\nOrganization.\nTicket Sales.\nA series of ticket-related scandals plagued the organizing committee as the Games approached, resulting in widespread public anger. Demand for tickets was high, particularly for the premier events which had sold out a year in advance. Residents had been promised that only 10 per cent of tickets would go to \"Olympic insiders\", IOC officials and sponsors, but OCO'88 was later forced to admit that up to 50 percent of seats to top events had gone to insiders. The organizing committee, which was subsequently chastised by mayor Klein for running a \"closed shop\", admitted that it had failed to properly communicate the obligations it had to supply IOC officials and sponsors with priority tickets.\nOrganizers attempted to respond to public concern by asking sponsors to consider reducing their orders and by paying $1.5 million to add 2,600 seats to the Saddledome, as well as increase capacity for ski jumping, alpine skiing and the opening and closing ceremonies. Organizers noted that the Calgary Games offered a then-record 1.9 million tickets for sale, three times the amount available at Sarajevo or Lake Placid, and that 79 per cent of tickets were to be allocated Calgarians and 21 per cent to sponsors and other VIPs. By the start of the 1988 Winter Games, a record of over 1.4 million tickets had been sold, a figure that eclipsed the previous three Winter Games combined. In the OCO'88's final report, the Committee admits the culmination of fraud charges, large portion of premier tickets requested by Olympic insiders, and poor communications led to a negative public reaction to the ticketing process.\nThese events were preceded by the ticketing manager for OCO'88 being charged with theft and fraud after he sent modified ticket request forms to Americans that asked them to pay in United States funds rather than Canadian and to return them to his company's post office box rather than the office of the organizing committee. The American dollar was trading 40 cents higher than the Canadian dollar, resulting in significantly higher than anticipated revenue through currency conversion. The ticket manager maintained his innocence claiming he was used as a scapegoat and credit card company Visa was responsible for the error, despite his claims, the ticketing manager was convicted of fraud, theft, and forgery, and sentenced to 5 years in prison.\nOther planning and logistical issues plagued ticket sales during the 1988 Winter Olympics. The OCO'88 ticketing department was not prepared to handle the significant demand created by the aggressive marketing strategy which saw cut-out advertisements placed in 27 major Canadian newspapers (3.7 million forms) and other intonational papers (800,000 forms) allowing individuals to buy tickets by mailing a certified cheque. Members of the public were under the assumption that the \"first-come first-serve\" ticketing process would allow those who mailed their cheques on the same day the forms were released the first rights at tickets. However, Canada Post did not mark letters with the date of posting, and the ticketing department placed mail into large 800-letter bins which was then opened in a computer generated random order. The backlog resulted in purchaser order notifications being delayed a month from November 30, 1986, to December 31, 1986. A second public ticket update was issued in February 1987 to notify the public of what tickets remained, as 50 per cent had been allocated by then, and a third ticket update was sent out in May 1987.\nThere were several groups which received pre-allocated tickets. The Children's Ticket Fund provided a total of 12,088 tickets were distributed to child-focused agencies and communities within Alberta and eastern British Columbia.\nProtests.\nLubicon Lake Band Protest.\nThe Lubicon Lake Band, a Cree First Nations in northern Alberta orchestrated a boycott of elements of the 1988 Winter Olympic Games as a protest for the abusive treatment by the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada had promised the Lubicon Cree a land settlement in 1940 which had failed to materialize.\nOCO'88 had planned an million Olympic Arts Festival to take place from January 14, 1988, to May 1, 1988, during the Games with over 600 exhibitions. The Lubicon protest focused on the Glenbow Museum's \"The Spirt Sings: Artistic Traditions of Canada's First Peoples\" exhibition sponsored by Shell Canada, which sought to display over 6,000 displaced first nations and non-first nations artifacts brought together from collections around the world. \"The Spirit Sings\" was considered by OCO'88 chairman Frank King as the \"flagship\" event of the Olympic Arts Festival. \"The Spirit Sings\" was intended to bring a wide array of First nations ethnographic materials from public and private European collections back to Canada for display, many of the artifacts were considered \"lost\" to Canadian scholars. \"The Spirt Sings\" sold more than 126,000 tickets during its five-week run in Calgary.\nThe Lubicon Cree began publicly discussing their goals and past treatment by the provincial and federal governments in the early-1980s which attracted broad national and international attention, with articles discussing the Lubicon plight appearing in \"The Globe and Mail\" and \"The New York Times\". The Lubicon call for a boycott started in 1986 after Shell Canada was announced as the sponsor for \"The Spirit Sings\", Shell had developed oil and gas infrastructure on land claimed by the Lubicon Cree. Lubicon Cree leaders Lennarson and Ominayak began a public relations campaign to convince European museums holding desirable objects for \"The Spirit Sings\" to not loan the objects, and were supported by other Indigenous organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations, the Indian Association of Alberta, the Metis Association of Alberta, and the Grand Council of Crees of Quebec. The boycott was somewhat successful, as it dissuaded 29 international museums from participating in \"The Spirit Sings\", including New York's National Museum of the American Indian. During the torch relay in Quebec, 700 Mohawks protested along the route."

        "text": "Major General David McMurtrie Gregg is a monumental statue located in Reading, Pennsylvania, United States. The monument was designed by Henry Augustus Lukeman and consists of an equestrian statue depicting David McMurtrie Gregg, a military officer who had served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The monument was dedicated in 1922, several years after Gregg's death in Reading in 1916.\nHistory.\nDavid McMurtrie Gregg was born in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, in 1833. He attended and graduated from the United States Military Academy and served as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War. During the war, he attained the rank of Major General and was involved in many battles involving the Army of the Potomac. During the Battle of Gettysburg, he distinguished himself by leading cavalry forces that helped the Union win the battle. He resigned in 1865, following which he lived in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he led an active civic life. He died on August 7, 1916, in Reading.\nFollowing his death, a monument was erected in his honor in Reading.

The FIG stated that Irish gymnasts competing for Northern Ireland would be \"a violation of the FIG Statutes and rules\" and recommended that the athletes concerned change their FIG license nationality (in effect, switch to a British licence) if they wished to regain eligibility. The Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council accused the FIG of \"completely disregarding\" the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which states that people from Northern Ireland can consider themselves British, Irish, or both; at the time, no other ASOIF member federation associated with the Commonwealth Games had adopted the FIG's stance.\nOn 27 June the decision was overturned and the three Northern Irish gymnasts were permitted to compete at the Commonwealth Games for Northern Ireland while still representing the island of Ireland at other international competitions."

        "text": "The Huddersfield Central Cricket League was a cricket league featuring teams in and around the town of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England between 1913 and 2016.\nHistory.\nThe league was founded in December 1913. The league's first matches, with 9 member teams, began in May 1914. Primrose Hill was the first champion.\nIn 1919 the league amalgamated with the Holme and Dearne Valley League after some founder clubs left to join the Huddersfield District League.\nTeams in this league were based in the town of Huddersfield, in the Colne and Holme Valleys surrounding the town, from the Spen Valley, from the nearby city of Wakefield and South Yorkshire towns of Penistone and Barnsley.\nHolden and Tinker Cups.\nIn 1928 a knockout competition was held for the 1st XI teams called the Holden Cup.

        "title": "John J. Phelan (boxing)",
        "text": "John James Phelan (June 2, 1872 – January 24, 1946) was an American boxing commissioner and military officer who served as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission and was a Major General in the New York Army National Guard.\nEarly life.\nPhelan was born on June 2, 1872, to John and Ellen Kingsley Phelan. From 1886 to 1895 he worked as a stock clerk for Arnold Constable &amp; Company. He then worked for Carl Gutmann Co., which manufactured women's underwear. He started as a salesman and rose the company, serving as its European buyer, general manager, and president before retiring in December 1939.\nMilitary service.\nIn 1895, Phelan enlisted in the New York Army National Guard as a private in Company G of the 69th New York Infantry Regiment. On July 11, 1916, as the 69th Regiment was leaving to fight in the Mexican Border War, Phelan, then a Lieutenant Colonel, was found physically unfit and relieved of his command by Major General Leonard Wood. Phelan's removal was appealed to United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, who upheld Wood's decision. Phelan was permitted to rejoin 69th in 1917 after an operation corrected his disability. Following his reinstatement, Phelan was promoted to Colonel and served as commander of the 69th, which was redesignated the 165th Infantry Regiment. During World War I he served as the commander of the 69th Regiment of the New York Guard. He returned to the 165th Infantry Regiment after the war. In 1926 he was promoted to brigadier general and put in command of the newly formed 93rd Infantry Brigade. He retired on June 3, 1936, when he reached the statutory retirement age of 64. He received a brevet promotion to Major General.\nBoxing.\nIn 1923, Governor Al Smith appointed Phelan, William J. McCormack, and D. Walker Wear to the newly formed state boxing licensing committee. In 1926, Phelan, as chairman of the licensing committee, was instrumental in prohibiting the first Jack Dempsey–Gene Tunney from taking place in New York, as the committee was already considering a proposed fight between Dempsey and Harry Wills. The fight instead took place in Philadelphia. He also blocked a Barney Ross–Jimmy McLarnin fight on the ground that Lou Ambers was the logical challenger. In 1927 the licensing committee was disbanded and its duties were absorbed by the New York State Athletic Commission.\nIn 1930, Secretary of State Edward J. Flynn appointed Phelan to a seat on the athletic commission. He succeeded George E. Brower, who had been appointed Kings County District Attorney. Phelan had been supported for the position by New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker and Tammany Hall leader John F. Curry and was chosen over the John H. McCooey-backed David F. Soden. In 1930, the commission voted 2 to 1 to recognize Max Schmeling as world heavyweight champion, with Phelan and James Farley voting in favor of recognizing Schmeling. The third commission member, William Muldoon believed that the fight between Schmeling and Jack Sharkey should have been ruled a no contest instead of a disqualification victory for Schmeling and opposed recognizing him as champion. In 1933, Phelan was tasked with investigating the death of Ernie Schaaf, who died following a bout with Primo Carnera. Phelan's inquiry found that no violations of the state's boxing rules and regulations had occurred in the Carnera–Schaaf fight and that \"it would have been highly improbable to detect\" the illness (meningitis) that killed Schaaf during the pre-fight medical examination.\nIn 1933, Phelan succeeded Farley, who resigned from the board to become United States Postmaster General, as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. In 1934, Phelan reversed the decision of the Tony Canzoneri–Cleto Locatelli bout after he discovered the ring announcer had misread one of the judge's ballots. In 1935, Phelan and fellow commissioner Bill Brown ordered a reversal of the decision in the Vince Dundee–Eddie Risko fight. The fight was originally declared a victory for Sisko, with Judge Sidney Scharlin and referee Jed Gahan voting in favor of Sisko and the other judge, Jack Britton, voting in favor of Dundee. Phelan, who was sitting at ringside, immediately performed an inspection of the ballots and found that Britton gave seven to Dundee and three to Risko and Scharlin scored five rounds for Dundee with four to Risko. Phelan, Brown, and Scharlin conferred and the decision was reversed in favor of Dundee. In 1936, Phelan and Brown voted to cancel a bout between Hank Bath and Red Burman after they received a telegram from the secretary of the California State Athletic Commission reporting that two of Bath's fights in that state were \"questionable\". That same year, Phelan was able to convince Mike Jacobs to hold the Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling fight in New York City. In 1937 the commission fined Joe Gould and James J. Braddock $1,000 for canceling Braddock's scheduled fight with Max Schmeling. In February 1938, the commission suspended the licenses of manager Joe Jacobs and boxer Tony Galento for Galento's failure to fight Harry Thomas. Galento's license was restored within a few months, however the commission refused to license Jacobs for the Louis-Schmeling rematch later that year. At the 1938 convention of the International Boxing Federation, Phelan was instrumental in defeating a proposal that would require all championships to have the approval of a special committee on which Americans would have minority representation. In 1939 he and Brown sued boxing promoter James J. Johnston for libel over Johnston's allegations that the two commissioners had a financial interest in the Twentieth Century Sporting Club. The suit ended when Johnston made a statement denying that he had used the word \"financial\" and added that he never meant to accuse Phelan and Brown of \"malfeasance or misfeasance of any kind\". Following Joe Louis's knockout victory over Billy Conn, Phelan undertook a search for the judge's ballots, which had gone missing after the fight. On June 20, 1941, Phelan announced that he had founded the ballots and that they showed the Conn had been ahead on points prior to being knocked out. Due to a shortage of boxers during World War II, Phelan recommended lowering the minimum age for boxers to 16.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1907, Phelan married Mary Irene Bradley. They had five children – Lillian, Helen, Jeanne, Marie, and John Jr. In 1934, Helen Phelan married Jack Mara, son of New York Giants owner Tim Mara. In 1921, Mary Phelan died while on a family vacation in Paris.\nOn September 27, 1932, Phelan married Angela Steiner Mattern, a widow and the mother of John Jr.'s friend and United States Military Academy classmate Richard Mattern, in Cold Spring, New York. Phelan's fellow commissioner William J. Brown served as the best man and Brown's wife was the maid of honor. Phelan was the stepfather of three children from Mattern's first marriage. In 1939, Phelan moved to a large suite at 333 West End Avenue, where he resided for the remainder of his life. John J. Phelan Jr. and Richard H. Mattern were killed in action during World War II.\nLater life.\nPhelan's term as chairman expired on December 31, 1944, and Governor Thomas E. Dewey chose to appoint Eddie Eagan rather than reappoint Phelan. Phelan was allowed to remain on the board, as Dewey appointed him to fill the unoccupied seat previously held by D. Walker Wear. In 1945, Phelan returned to the business world as vice president of the Mara Fuel Company. Phelan died on January 22, 1946, at Polyclinic Hospital following a long illness. His funeral at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament was attended by 800 mourners. He was buried at Calvary Cemetery."

        "title": "Peace (esports)",
        "text": "Peace (stylised as PEACE) was an Australian professional \"League of Legends\" team competing in the \"League of Legends\" Circuit Oceania (LCO), the top-level league for the game in Oceania. The team qualified for the World Championship in its debut year after an upset victory over Pentanet.GG in the LCO 2021 Split 2 playoffs. In 2023, PEACE was removed from the LCO after submitting their roster late, and disqualified and their roster was forced to be sold.\nHistory.\n2021 season.\nLCO 2021.\nPeace was founded on 16 February 2021 by Edward Luo, following his acquisition of Avant Gaming's LCO spot. Avant Gaming had announced prior that it was merging with the Dire Wolves and selling its LCO spot. Peace's inaugural roster consisted of top laner Yao \"Apii\" Jianjing, jungler Thomas \"LeeSA\" Ma, mid laner James \"Halo\" Giacoumakis, bot laner Vincent \"Violet\" Wong, and support Ryan \"Aladoric\" Richardson. Bot laner Wang \"Chayon\" Yuncheng also joined Peace as a substitute player, and jungler Shane \"Kevy\" Allen later joined the team in the middle of the LCO 2021 Split 1.\nPeace concluded their inaugural split, the LCO 2021 Split 1, with a strong finish. The team placed third in the regular season after losing a second place tiebreaker match to Dire Wolves, qualifying them for the winners' bracket of playoffs. Peace swept Dire Wolves in the first round before they were knocked down to the losers' bracket by Pentanet.GG after a close series. Peace then defeated The Chiefs in the losers' bracket to qualify for a rematch against Pentanet.GG in the finals. Peace was once again defeated by Pentanet.GG and finished runners-up in their inaugural split.\nPeace signed several players to their roster in preparation for the LCO 2021 Split 2. Veteran players Leo \"Babip\" Romer and James \"Tally\" Shute were signed as the team's new starting jungler and mid laner, respectively. Support Junfu \"Zingy\" Jia also joined as a substitute player, while Kevy left Peace to join Order.\nPeace had a slower start to the LCO 2021 Split 2 than Split 1, but the team was able to win their first domestic title in Split 2 nonetheless. For much of the regular season, Peace struggled to keep a consistent starting roster and many players role-swapped for different iterations. The team's substitute players Chayon and Zingy both saw time on-stage, top laner Apii and jungler LeeSA both played support for a few games, and at one point mid laner Tally had become the team's top laner. Owing to their constant roster changes, Peace finished fifth in the regular season and qualified for playoffs with the lowest seed in the losers' bracket. By the end of the regular season, Peace had committed to its original starting roster of Apii, Babip, Tally, Violet, and Aladoric. To many analysts' surprise, Peace made it through the entire losers' bracket to qualify for a rematch against Pentanet.GG in the finals. Peace defeated The Chiefs, Order, and Dire Wolves in the first, second, and third rounds of the losers' bracket, respectively. Despite most analysts predicting a Pentanet.GG victory, Peace surprised many by sweeping Pentanet.GG to claim their first LCO title and qualify for the 2021 World Championship (Worlds 2021).\nWorlds 2021.\nShortly before Worlds 2021 was scheduled to begin, it was announced that Apii and LeeSA would not participate in the tournament due to visa issues. As Chinese citizens, both players had to apply for an Icelandic visa through the Chinese embassy in Australia, but the building was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Peace's management considered having the two players return to China to get their Icelandic visas there, but the isolation period required afterwards would be longer than the duration of the tournament, and so the decision was made to find replacements for the pair instead. A week later, Peace announced that veteran LEC player Kiss \"Vizicsacsi\" Tamás would replace Apii, and that the team would go to Worlds 2021 with only one jungler.\nFor the play-in stage of Worlds 2021, Peace was placed in Group A, along with China's LNG Esports, South Korea's Hanwha Life Esports, Brazil's Red Canids, and Latin America's Infinity Esports. Peace finished third in their group and qualified for the knockout stage. Peace defeated Red Canids in a close series in the first round, but the team was swept by Cloud9 in the second, qualifying round.\n2022 season.\nBabip, Halo, Tally, Violet, and Aladoric all left Peace shortly after the conclusion of Worlds 2021.\nIn February 2022, Tally and Aladoric accused Peace of failing to pay several of its former players \"tens of thousands\" in bonuses and prize-pool cuts."

He played fullback and wing and was regarded for his good kicking game, along with his good ball-handling. In 1931, he made the semi-finals with West End's under 16 rugby union team. His side defeated Norman Park 5–3 in the semi-finals. He scored 3 tries in a third grade game against Eastern Suburbs. McLarty scored 3 tries in the reserve grade Valley's 44–3 win in an August 1933 matchup vs Southern Suburbs.\nThe reserve grade Valleys made the 1934 semi-finals and McLarty played in the match against Western Suburbs. While Valleys found momentum later in the game, it was not enough to defeat Wests - who would win 16–6. In April 1935, McLarty scored a try and 2 goals against Souths in reserve grade.\nMcLarty's side made the reserve grade semi finals in 1936, however his side lost 14–5 to Norths. In July, he scored a try to help Valleys win the Pike Cup final over Western Suburbs.\nIn 1938, he was signed by the Valleys first grade team, after a short stint in rugby union for Eagle Junction. Later that year, he made an appearance for the first grade side at five-eighth in Valleys' intercity match against the Rockhampton representative team. Valleys' 32-0 trashing of Rockhampton resulted in many of the crowd leaving the game early and led the Central Queensland Herald to describe Rockhamptons' performance as a \"Kindergarten display\".\nIn May 1938, McLarty played in Valleys' 50–9 win over Brothers in A Grade."

        "text": "The 2000–01 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey season was the 79th season of play for the program. They represent Boston College in the 2000–01 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season and for the 17th season in Hockey East. The Eagles were coached by Jerry York, in his 7th season, and played their home games at the Conte Forum.\nSeason.\nMilestone.\nEntering the season, head coach Jerry York needed just seven wins to reach 600 for his career. Early on, the team lived up to their pre-season ranking, winning four road games before heading into a showdown with Wisconsin. In a battle between the top two ranked programs, BC entered the third period with a lead, only to see the Badgers score twice to take the match. After a poor start from backup netminder Tim Kelleher, Scott Clemmensen finished the following game, allowing BC to get back on track. The next week, the Eagles returned to type, winning both games, and gave York his milestone.\nSettling in.\nAfter a second consecutive poor showing from their backup, on November 7, BC turned over the net to Clemmenson for most of the rest of the season and got stellar play from the senior. In the team's 7–2 win over Merrimack, captain Brian Gionta set the program record for the fastest two goals when he scored 10 seconds apart in the third period. In the same game he recorded his 8th-career hat-trick, tying the program record, and hit 100 goals for his career, becoming the 4th player in program history to reach that mark. BC ended the first half of their season by taking down #11 Maine and establishing themselves as the #2 team in the nation, just behind Michigan State.\nMissed opportunity.\nBC began the second half of the regular season with its second 2-vs-1 matchup. Just like the first time, the Eagles were unable to overcome the higher-seeded team and fell to MSU in the Great Lakes Invitational semifinal. Boston College retained its ranking after recovering with a win over #4 Michigan in the consolation game. A further loss to arch-rival Boston University dropped the team one spot but four consecutive wins over ranked teams had them back in the #2 spot before long. In the last game in January, Gionta again set new program records. By scoring 5 goals in the first, he set a Hockey East record for the most goals in one period. He tied the program record of 112 career goals while setting a new benchmark of 9 career hat-tricks. The game also marked the first season sweep of Maine since 1990.\nBeanpot champions.\nAfter completing the season sweep of Massachusetts–Lowell, BC rode into the Beanpot tied in one poll for the #1 seed. The Eagles dropped Harvard in the semifinal, setting up a showdown with BU a week later. In the interim, however, BC saw its 6-game winning streak ended by Providence. Having lost yet another shot at being the top team in the nation, Boston College took out their frustrations out on the Terriers and won the Beanpot for the first time in seven years. Clemmenson was named tournament MVP.\nDown the stretch.\nThe Eagles split the following weekend against #8 New Hampshire and then were not quite up to par a week later versus Massachusetts. Despite not losing either match, BC dropped to #3 in the polls but rebounded with two wins to end their regular season. Boston College ended atop the Hockey East standings with a 7-point margin. It was the first conference title for the Eagles in a decade.\nHockey East tournament.\nBC opened their postseason with Scott Clemmensen earning the program record 13th and final shutout of his college career against Merrimack. He continued his strong play, allowing 1 goal in each of the next two games, and sent BC to their 4th-consecutive conference title game. The team got a tougher fight from Providence, but Tony Voce led the way with two goals and BC won the Hockey East Championship. Despite being held off the scoresheet in the final, Chuck Kobasew was named as the Tournament MVP.\nNCAA tournament.\nEntering the tournament as the #2 team in the nation, Boston College received the top eastern seed and a bye into the second round. Their first game came against Maine, the team that had knocked them out in 1999, and BC continued their dominance of the Black Bears in '01 with 3–1 victory. Entering their 4th-consecutive Frozen Four, the Eagles were faced with Michigan, the squad that had defeated them for the title in 1998, for the second time on the year. The seniors were able to get their revenge three-years in the making and took the game 4–2.\nBC reached the championship game for the second straight season and the third time in four years. The only team left in their path to the title was defending champion, North Dakota. The two teams fought to a scoreless draw after one period and BC took over in the second, beginning with a power play goal from Kobasew. Senior Mike Lephart got a second goal three minutes later and Scott Clemmensen kept UND off the board until late in the game. After BC took a penalty for too many men with less than 5 minutes to play, the Fighting Sioux pulled their goaltender and cut the lead in half. Wes Dorey ted the game with under a minute before the buzzer and sent the championship into overtime. Despite the sudden change in fortune, BC found their nerve in the extra session and sent 4 shots on goal in less than 5 minutes. The final of which, coming from the stick of Krys Kolanos, found the back of the net and game Boston College its first national championship in 52 years. BC also became just the 3rd national champion that played more games on the road than at home (1978 Boston University, 1994 Lake Superior State)\nKobasew was named Tournament MOP while Clemmensen set the NCAA record for most game played by a goaltender in a Frozen Four with seven.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=11 style=\";\" | "

The snowflake is made up of interlocking \"c\"'s, small \"c\"'s representing Calgary, and the large \"c\"'s representing Canada. The five interlocking \"c\"'s represented the theme of the 1988 Games \"Come Together in Calgary\".\nMotto.\nThe official motto of the 1988 Winter Olympics was \"Coming Together in Calgary\" ().\nMascots.\nOCO'88 introduced the mascots of the Calgary Games Hidy and Howdy, at the closing ceremony of the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The mascots named \"Hidy\" and \"Howdy\", chosen through a public contest, were a smiling cowboy-themed polar bears designed to evoke images of \"western hospitality\". The mascots were played by a team of 150 students from Bishop Carroll High School, the sister-brother pair made up to 300 appearances per month in the lead up to the Games.

For the 1988 Winter Games there were 21 sponsors, 30 suppliers, 40 licensees, 27 contributors and one donor. Official sponsors were categorized into tiers based on contribution total, with million separating each tier, official sponsors resulted in million in support for the Games. Official suppliers were required to provide at least in contributions, official suppliers resulted in million in support for the Games. Licensing programs were seen as successful in Canada, but unsuccessful in international markets due to challenges negotiation with individual National Olympic Committees.\nTeam Petroleum '88.\nTeam Petroleum '88 was a program developed by OCO'88 as a program to engage oil and gas corporations in the Calgary region with the Olympic Games. Participating corporations were not provided any marketing rights, but were instead given access to tickets in a special lounge at the Olympic Saddledome for high-profile events, and priority access to tickets in other events. The Team Petroleum '88 program generated million in revenue from 44 corporations.\nOfficial songs and anthems.\nThe official song of the 1988 Winter Olympics was \"Can't You Feel It\", composed by Canadian David Foster for the Games."

        "text": "The XIII(13th) FIFA World Cup was scheduled to take place in Colombia, between May 31 and June 29, 1986, after being selected as the venue in 1974. However, in November 1982 Colombia declined due to the impossibility of complying with the requirements that FIFA demanded to celebrate the event, marking an unprecedented and unrepeated event in the history of the World Cups.\nThe FIFA Executive Committee, after a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden in May 20, 1983, decided to replace Colombia with Mexico, who became the first country to hold a World Cup twice, after 1970.\nBackground.\nIn 1973, the Colombian Football/Soccer Federation had submitted its candidacy to FIFA to organize the 1986 World Cup. The country received the commission of the governing body of world football/soccer that year, and the friendship between (Colombian sports dirigent) and Sir Stanley Rous (president of FIFA) helped to achieve the venue.\nOn June 9, 1974, FIFA designated Colombia as the venue for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, with the passing of time, due to the few progress in the works of the stadia and the ever bigger requirements of FIFA Executive Committee, the possibility that the country could really host the event was diluted.\nBy the time the venue was awarded to Colombia, the FIFA World Cup was contested by 16 teams, but the format was expanded to 24 since the 1982 edition on the eve of 1978 FIFA World Cup, which practically ended the chances of the Colombian government to host the event.\nIn 1970, during the National Games (the Colombian multi-sport event), Alfonso Senior obtained the support of then President Carlos Lleras Restrepo to launch the candidacy for the World Cup.\nIn 1974, Colombian president Misael Pastrana congratulated Alfonso Senior for the designation of Colombia to celebrate the tournament:\nIn the final of the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, a banner read \"Nos vemos en el Mundial Colombia 86\" (See you at the World Cup Colombia 86). The back cover of the Colombian edition of the Panini sticker album of the same World Cup had the announcement \"Apoyamos el Mundial Colombia 86\" (We support the World Cup Colombia 86). In 1982 the Colombia-86 Corporation was created, created by private parties such as the Grancolombiano Group and Bavaria (which would withdraw) to finance the World Cup.\nProposed venues.\nA total of 5 stadiums in the same number of cities were presented by Colombia for the World Cup. All the stadia were going to be repaired and one was going to be completely new. These stadiums were:\nWithdrawal of hosting duties.\nThe Colombian government considered these requirements as excessive and impossible to meet. Therefore, on October 25, 1982, the president of Colombia Belisario Betancur announced the cancellation of the organization of the event. Colombia's resignation from hosting the 1986 World Cup was confirmed by FIFA on November 5, 1982.\nFor the election of the new venue there were 4 candidate countries: Canada, Brazil, United States and Mexico, although Brazil withdrew shortly before the designation while the United States, which did not have much support, preferred to organize a better candidacy for the 1994 FIFA World Cup (from which the country was elected). Both countries inclined their support to the Mexican candidacy. Finally, on May 20, 1983, FIFA unanimously designated Mexico, which had already hosted the 1970 FIFA World Cup and thus maintained the tactic of rotating venues between Europe and Latin America.\nConsequences and legacy.\nAlfonso Senior Quevedo was one of the first to regret President Betancur's decision, before resigning from the presidency of the Colombian football/soccer Federation (FCF).\nColombia did not organize an important national team tournament until the 2001 Copa América, an event that the Canadian national team declined to attend, due to logistical problems with their football/soccer players. The Argentinian national team didn't attend too, due to an alleged risk to their safety.\nThe country applied again to organize the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was announced by the then President Álvaro Uribe, at the opening of the Central American and Caribbean Games held in Cartagena, on July 15, 2006. On April 11, 2007, the president of the FCF Luis Bedoya announced that he would confirm Colombia's resignation to host the tournament, leaving Brazil as the only candidate, and subsequently chosen as the venue for the tournament. However, on May 26, 2008, Colombia was designated as the venue for the 2011 U-20 FIFA World Cup, the first FIFA tournament hosted in Colombia.\nLater, in August 2016, Colombia announced its intention to host the 2023 Women's World Cup, but on June 25, 2020, FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced Australia and New Zealand as hosts of the tournament, defeating the Colombia's candidacy by a vote of 22–13 in the first and only round of votes.\nThis is not the only time that Colombia has lost the venue for an international sporting event, since on May 20, 2021, Conmebol decided to take away the venue for the 2021 Copa América due to public order problems as a result of protests in the country."

The race consisted of five 21 ft Class B boats, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge competing against each other. It rained during the entire race. It was the first regatta in the Bahamas since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago.\nDue to downpours, the visibility around waters had been down to 150 ft at one point, which delayed the start of the race.\nThe Duchess's boat, Ants Nest II, had suffered a technical problem at the start, that lost their time at the start. \"They had to drop the sail down, which cost them a good 50 metres at the start of the race\", Jimmie Lowe, director of sailing at the Bahamas Sailing Association, said.\nThe race involved sailing around a three and a half mile course off Montagu Beach in Nassau. The Duke steered his boat, Susan Chase, around the three-and-a-half mile course after being handed control of the tiller once his boat had rounded the first point. The Duke's team won the race, while the Duchess's came last."

        "title": "Randy Gordon (boxing)",
        "text": "Randy Gordon (born March 11, 1949) is an American boxing journalist, commentator, and administrator.\nSportswriting.\nGordon earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Long Island University and began his broadcasting career as an overnight and weekend DJ and assistant sports director at rock-and-roll station WGBB. He compiled a 37–2 record as an amateur boxer and was knocked out in the second round of his only professional fight.\nSportswriting.\nGordon began covering boxing in 1974 for Stanley Weston's \"World &amp; International Boxing Magazines\". In 1979 he was recruited to \"The Ring\" by Bert Sugar. He succeeded Bert Sugar as editor in 1983. One year later, Gordon was let go in a cost-cutting measure. The \"New York Times\" reported that the magazine was close to $1.3 million in debt and many of the publication's highest salaried employees were let go. He was succeeded by Nigel Collins.\nTelevision commentator.\nGordon began his commentary career on ESPN's coverage of Top Rank Boxing in December 1980. He was removed from the network in Octgober 1982 after criticizing Top Rank's use of a medically-suspended fighter during a broadcast. From 1984 to 1988 he was the analyst for \"USA Wednesday/Thursday Night Fights\". In January 1983, he became the Boxing Analyst for the USA Network. In 1986 he succeeded John Condon on the MSG Network, providing color commentary for Felt Forum bouts alongside blow-by-blow announcers Sam Rosen and Bruce Beck. Sam Rosen.\nNew York State Athletic Commission.\nIn 1987, José Torres resigned as chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission to write a Mike Tyson biography. Sugar Ray Leonard, Gil Clancy, Alex Wallau, and Joyce Carol Oates were considered for the job, but were not interested. Gordon was selected out of the remaining candidates, which included Michael Katz, Harold Lederman, and Arthur Mercante Sr. His nomination was confirmed by the New York Senate on March 14, 1989.\nAfter taking office, Gordon saw that fighters underwent intense background checks and mandatory drug tests. He also sought proof of contracts and payouts between fighters and managers. He refused to sanction bouts he saw as mismatches. For this reason he vetoed two of George Foreman's proposed opponents and canceled at least a dozen matches promoted by Bob Goodman.\nIn 1989, Gordon chaired the commission's hearings over Bill Cayton's complaint that Don King was interfering in his boxer-manager agreement with Mike Tyson. The hearings ended inconclusively after Gordon made a comment regarding Tyson's deceased former manager Jimmy Jacobs shopping the fighter around. King's attorney requested that Gordon recuse himself as the statement made him a witness to Jacobs and Cayton's intentions and could prejudice his decision making towards King.\nGordon held up the judge's decision in the December 1, 1989 fight between Dennis Milton and Michael Olajide pending a review by the athletic commission. The match ended when Ken Zimmer stopped the fight and appeared to declare Olajide the winner by a technical knockout. However, Zimmer said that he thought he had heard the bell signaling the fight's end and Milton was declared the winner by decision. After reviewing video tape of the fight, the commission ruled that Milton won the bout.\nFollowing Jesse Ferguson's February 6, 1993 victory over Ray Mercer, Gordon brought allegations that the fight was fixed to the New York State Police. Mercer was indicted for trying to bribe his opponent, but found not guilty.\nAfter the Buddy McGirt vs. Pernell Whitaker fight, Gordon and the commission were criticized for allowing McGirt, who had a torn rotator cuff, to compete. Gordon stated that he and commission doctor Barry Jordan had examined McGirt and were both convinced that he was in shape to fight. Afterwards, NcGirt admitted he had hid the shoulder injury from the Commissioner and the medical staff. \nOn March 8, 1993, Commissioner Gordon--always an advocate of females being involved in the sport--assigned three female judges to score the Aaron Davis-Nick Rupa Super Middleweight main event at Madison Square Garden. It was the first time three female judges had been assigned to the same fight. They were Carol Castellano, Melvina Lathan and Barbara Perez. Both Lathan and Perez scored it 98-92 for Davis; Castellano had the same winner by a 97-93 score.\nIn 1995, Commissioner Gordon approved females to box in New York State for the first time. Shortly after, Kathy Collins won a four-round decision against Lori Bishoff in Westbury, New York. \nShortly after, Gordon was fired by Cuomo's successor in a customary political move. Gordon was replaced by former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson.\nLater work.\nFrom 1995 to 1997, Gordon was the Director of Boxing at Foxwoods Resort Casino. In 2007 he joined Sirius Satellite Radio as the host of a boxing and Mixed Martial Arts show. He and Gerry Cooney currently host \"At the Fights\" on SiriusXM. In June 2023, Gordon re-joined the staff of \"Ring Magazine\" as a columnist with \"Commissioner's Corner.\""

        "title": "Major League Baseball on Fox Sports Networks",
        "text": "Major League Baseball on Fox Sports Networks refers to Major League Baseball television coverage on the former chain of Fox Sports regional networks.\nBackground.\nBeginning in 1997, as part of the contract with Major League Baseball it had signed the year before. Fox entered a four-year joint venture with Liberty Media Cable worth $172 million. Its recently launched the cable sports network, Fox Sports Net and was given rights to two Thursday night games per week, one for the Eastern and Central time zones and one for the Mountain and Pacific time zones with no exclusivity.\nFor the 2000 and 2001 seasons, the Fox network's then-sister cable channel, Fox Family (later ABC Family, now Freeform) carried a weekly Major League Baseball game on Thursday nights (a game that had previously aired nationwide on Fox Sports Net from 1997 to 1999), as well as select postseason games from the Division Series.\nAfter The Walt Disney Company's $2.9 billion acquisition of Fox Family in October 2001, the Thursday night cable television rights went to ESPN. Fox Sports Net's affiliates would however, continue to broadcast Major League Baseball games on a local basis until 2020. Come the start of the 2021 season, Fox Sports Networks were rebranded to Bally Sports following the Sinclair Broadcast Group's purchase of the Fox Corporation's regional sports channels.\nFrom 2006 to 2006, Fox Sports Net also aired \"The FSN Baseball Report\", which was a daily baseball analysis program aired during the Major League Baseball season.\nLeague Championship Series coverage.\nFor the first year of its exclusive six-year contract (2001), Fox did a split telecast (which had not been attempted since the ill-fated \"Baseball Network\" arrangement existed) for the League Championship Series. This meant that two games were played simultaneously on the same night, with one game airing on the Fox network and the other on the regional Fox Sports Net cable channel (depending on market, as some markets did not have a regional sports network with a relationship to FSN). The rationale behind the split-telecast was that because of the September 11 attacks, the entire post-season schedule was delayed by a week. Because of this, two Sunday LCS games came in conflict with a \"Fox NFL\" doubleheader. Fans and sports journalists were unimpressed with the situation and MLB commissioner Bud Selig vowed that it was a one-time deal necessitated by circumstance. However, in later years, Fox used split telecasts on a few occasions to keep the playoffs \"on schedule\" and maximize its prime time advertising revenue, and aired the second game on FX, which has virtually nationwide distribution on cable and satellite. This ensured that Fox did not have to air an LCS game on a weekday afternoon, when many viewers are unable to watch.\nIn , Game 5 of the NLCS and Game 4 of the ALCS were split between Fox and Fox Sports Net. This came off the heels of Fox airing an NFL doubleheader that particular day (October 21). In , Game 1 of the NLCS and Game 2 of the ALCS were split between Fox and Fox Sports Net. The regional split was done in order for Fox to avoid televising a weekday afternoon game. In , Game 1 of the NLCS and Game 2 of the ALCS were split between Fox and Fox Sports Net.\nTheme music.\nNJJ Music composed the original \"MLB on Fox\" theme music in 1996. This theme music was used exclusively from June 1996 until early May 2007. In mid-May 2007, an updated version was unveiled, featuring a more jazzy feel and implementing a full orchestra instead of the synth elements used by the 1996 theme. For the 2007 postseason, a Jochen Flach-composed slow orchestral theme was unveiled, and was used alongside the new orchestral theme for the All-Star Game and postseason from the 2007 ALCS until the 2010 All-Star Game. \"Fox Saturday Baseball\", including the prime time games starting in 2010, still used the 2007 version of the regular theme song exclusively.\nDuring the 2009 season, some Fox Sports regional affiliates switched to the 2007 theme while others continued using the original 1996 theme. However, all regional affiliates began using the 2007 theme starting with the 2011 season.\nBeginning with the 2010 postseason, both the 2007 theme and the Flach theme were replaced by the longtime \"NFL on Fox\" theme music, which began to be used for all Fox sporting events. However, starting in 2011 and continuing to today, various songs from the album \"Heroes: The Olympic Collection\" were used when going into commercial breaks during the All-Star Game, postseason, and other marquee games such as Red Sox-Yankees games.\nIn 2014, the 2007–2010 jazz theme was brought back for regular season \"MLB on FS1\". The NFL theme was retained for \"MLB on Fox\", including \"Fox Saturday Baseball,\" \"Baseball Night in America\", the All-Star Game and all coverage of the postseason. However, occasionally one of the two themes was heard on telecasts that were designated for the other, implying that the designations are slightly fluid.\nIn 2020, \"MLB on Fox\" reintroduced the original 1996-2007 theme; Fox Sports regional affiliates continued to use the 2007-2010 theme until the network was rebranded to Bally Sports in 2021. As of the 2021 season, the original theme is now used for coverage of all games across both Fox and FS1.\nCommentators.\nPlay-by-play announcers for the FSN/Fox Family coverage included Kenny Albert, Thom Brennaman, Chip Caray, Josh Lewin, and Steve Physioc. Color analysts included Bob Brenly, Kevin Kennedy, Steve Lyons, and Jeff Torborg.

        "title": "Major League Baseball on Fox Television Stations",
        "text": "The following refers to the history of Major League Baseball coverage on local Fox affiliated stations as opposed to the national broadcasts on the Fox Broadcasting Company beginning in 1996.\nFox's relationship with baseball before 1996.\nKTTV 11, which has been Fox's owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles, California since the network's launch in 1986, carried Los Angeles Dodgers baseball games since the team's move from Brooklyn, New York in 1958 (with exception of a brief pause from 1993 to 1995). The station aired road games beginning in the late 1970s with the home games on the subscription/pay-per-view service Dodgervision; these road games aired on the station until 1992, when KTLA began airing the road games beginning with the 1993 season.\nFox's owned-and-operated Chicago affiliate, WFLD 32 acquired the rights to broadcast Major League Baseball games from the Chicago White Sox in 1968, assuming the contract from WGN-TV. Under the initial deal, WFLD carried White Sox games until 1972, when the team returned to WGN through a joint arrangement with WSNS-TV that lasted through the 1980 season and exclusively during the 1981 season; WFLD reassumed Sox game rights in 1982, carrying most of the team's non-cable games. In October 1988, the station filed a lawsuit against the White Sox club to terminate its television contract with the team, which was set to last through 1991, accusing team owners Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn of \"gutting and stripmining the[...] team of salary investment, player quality and fan goodwill\", which resulted in a decline in viewership for the games and profit losses for the station on the contract (WFLD's profits from the telecasts slid from $1.5 million profit in 1985 to a loss of $1.4 million in 1988, resulting in the rights fees costing four times more than the accrued revenue; ratings during that three-year period also dropped from a 5.1 share in 1985 to a 1.7 in August 1988) as well as breached advertising agreements with the Chicagoland Dodge Dealers consortium. Following an out-of-court settlement between WFLD station management and the Sox, on September 14, 1989, the White Sox announced that it would move its local television broadcasts back to WGN-TV beginning with the 1990 season.\nAnother original charter Fox affiliate, KMSP 9 out of Minneapolis, Minnesota carried the Minnesota Twins from 1979-1988 and again from 1998-2002, when it was then affiliated with UPN. WTXF 29 out of Philadelphia, which became an owned-and-operated Fox station in 1995, aired Philadelphia Phillies games from 1983-1992.\nKTVU 2 obtained the rights to televise San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball games in 1961, three years after the team relocated to the Bay Area from New York City. After the move, the Giants initially opted against televising their games to encourage game attendance by Bay Area residents and tourists. When channel 2 became the Giants' television partner, it was only permitted to televise the team's road games against the Los Angeles Dodgers until 1965, when the station began airing additional regular season and exhibition games (KTVU's relationship with the Giants extended to the franchise's ownership, as Cox Enterprises owned a 10% stake in the Giants during the latter years of the broadcast contract). KTVU eventually began sharing the local television rights to the Giants with SportsChannel Bay Area (now NBC Sports Bay Area, in which the Giants had purchased a 30% minority interest in December 2007) when the regional sports network launched in July 1991. Channel 2 lost the local over-the-air telecast rights to the Giants following the 2007 season when the broadcast television contract was taken over by San Jose-based NBC owned-and-operated station KNTV (channel 11). KTVU wouldn't become an owned-and-operated Fox station until 2014."

J. Watt of the Houston Texans and Vernon Davis of the San Francisco 49ers, and the Season 2 premiere of the NickMom series \"Take Me to Your Mother\". On February 1, the day before the Super Bowl, Jeff Sutphen, in character as his superhero alter ego Pick Boy, hosted a half-hour special called Nickelodeon's All Access Pass to Super Bowl XLVIII. The special not only covered the activities surrounding Super Bowl week in Times Square but also featured exclusive player interviews as well an interview with the winner of the NFL Play 60 Super Bowl contest, Thomas Brown.\n\"Nickelodeon Superstar Slime Showdown at Super Bowl\" (2017–18).\nFor Super Bowl LI in 2017, Nickelodeon produced another set of programming for its networks.

It featured \"Nick-ified\" season highlights, and other segments previewing the game. The special premiered on February 5, 2021, and repeated throughout Super Bowl weekend. \nAlthough a full Nickelodeon telecast was not aired (as the Super Bowl was broadcast only by CBS to maximize viewership), CBS and Nickelodeon produced themed content throughout the game for its social media platforms, including video highlights presented by Noah Eagle and Green with similar visual effects to the Wild Card Game broadcast, which were also featured during the main CBS telecast during the halftime show.

        "title": "List of 1988 Winter Olympics broadcasters",
        "text": "The 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary were televised by a number of broadcasters throughout the world.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympic Games coincided with a shift in television policy by the International Olympic Committee and growing enthusiasm by broadcasters in the United States. Amendments to the \"Olympic Charter\" in 1977 established a policy mandating joint television rights involving the IOC and the local organizing committee, and was enshrined in the 1981 bid agreement for the Calgary games.\nEffect of television on the 1988 Winter Olympics.\nOCO'88 made several alterations to the Olympic program as part of efforts to ensure value for its broadcast partners. Premier events, including ice hockey, figure skating, and speed skating were scheduled for prime time and could not continue past 9:00 p.m. EST, resulting in odd starting times such as 5:45 p.m. or 6:15 p.m. MST. The OCO'88 organizers described the time requirements dictated by ABC's contract as resulting in \"unnecessarily complex\" restrictions on ice hockey, which shared the Olympic Saddledome with figure skating, particularly noting the 90 minute turnaround time to allow patrons to enter and exit and make adjustments to the ice surface. The Games were lengthened to 16 days from the previous 12 to ensure three weekends of coverage, and special event consideration was given for February 15 which was the national holiday of Presidents' Day in the United States.\nHowever, a significant downturn in advertising revenue for sporting events resulted in ABC forecasting significant financial losses on the Games. Calgary organizers appreciated their fortunate timing in signing the deal. King described the timing of the contract with ABC as \"the passing of the sun and the moon at the right time for Calgary\". The revenue growth from broadcasting was significant for the Calgary Games, the 1980 Lake Placid Games generated million, while OCO'88 generated $324.9 million in broadcast rights. ABC lost an estimated $60 million, and broadcast rights to the 1992 Winter Olympics were later sold to the CBS network for $243 million, a 20 per cent reduction compared to Calgary.\nBroadcast contracts.\nCanada.\nPrior to the 1988 Winter Olympics, Canadian Olympic broadcasting was shared between the CTV Television Network, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and TVA in an agreement made in 1978. CTV approached the CBC with the agreement led by CTV Sports Vice-president Johnny Esaw who saw the risk soaring broadcast rights would bring to the networks. This sharing agreement allowed the Canadian rights to remain relatively affordable and to provide Olympic coverage to all of Canada. The agreement gave the rights to the Summer Olympics to the CBC and the Winter Olympics to CTV, and each broadcaster could air a nightly summary for the Olympics they were not the Canadian broadcaster for.\nAfter Calgary was awarded the 1988 Olympics Esaw and CTV continued to support sharing the rights to the Olympic Games, however in a meeting with CBC Head of Sports Denis Harvey, Esaw was informed the CBC intended to end the agreement. Harvey believed the CBC as the national broadcaster would be awarded the television rights. Esaw had previously built a strong relationship with influential figures in the Calgary bid including Bill Pratt through his work covering the \"Calgary Stampede\", which Pratt was the General Manager of. Esaw also saw an advantage in bidding with his Western Canadian heritage. The bid was especially important as the winner of the Canadian broadcast rights for the Games would also include the role as the host broadcaster, responsible for the manpower and equipment to televise the games for other international broadcasters. Esaw proposed that CTV would cover the Calgary Olympics using rented equipment rather than buying new equipment. Previously, the CBC served as the host broadcaster for the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics and purchased new equipment which the broadcaster kept, and by renting CTV could keep costs down for OCO'88.\nIn November 1983, CTV submitted two bids to OCO'88, submitting million for the exclusive Canadian broadcasting rights, and a $23.5 million bid to serve as the host broadcaster. Later in December 1983, CTV was awarded both the exclusive Canadian broadcasting rights and the role as host broadcaster. The nightly summary of the Games was also televised on CBC. French language coverage in Quebec was provided by TVA.\nFrank King noted that CTV won due to its lower bid, experience working with possible United States rights holder ABC through \"Wide World of Sports\", and CTV's conciliatory approach to negotiations. OCO'88 also noted that CTV's bid would see a net cost savings of million. The CBC was awarded the exclusive radio broadcast rights in Canada for .\nCTV planned to produce 550 hours of coverage for the Games to be broadcast around the world and provide 120 hours of coverage broadcast in Canada. This was accomplished with 1,400 staff brought from CTV affiliates around Canada. CTV charged for 30 seconds of commercial time during the Calgary Games.\nEastern Europe.\nThe rights to broadcast the 1988 Winter Olympic Games were awarded to International Radio and Television Organisation for Eastern Europe.\nJapan.\nThe Japanese broadcast rights were awarded to NHK in July 1986 for million.\nUnited States.\nThe joint negotiating committee convened in late-January at the Lausanne Palace prior to the Sarajevo games in 1984 to negotiate the Calgary television contracts with American broadcasters. The co-negotiating committee was represented by Dick Pound for the IOC, Bill Wardle for OCO and consultant Barry Frank. The co-negotiating committee designed a new tender process for the television rights bid with an emphasis on creating a level playing field for all broadcasters. For the first time, the negotiations were based on a series of sealed bids and representatives from ABC, CBS and NBC vied for the opportunity to broadcast the Games.\nAfter six rounds of sealed bids, the ABC delegation led by producer Roone Arledge was successful with a record agreement paying million in exchange for exclusive rights for the games. CBS exited the bidding process after the second round with a final offer of $257 million, while ABC and NBC both reached the fifth round with an offer of $300 million. In the sixth and final stage, the IOC and OCO decided a coin flip would determine which of ABC or NBC had the right to submit the first bid, or defer, and decision neither network supported. NBC's president of sports Arthur A. Watson elected to call the coin-flip, although he remained silent on the first flip, so a second coinflip was required, and NBC won with a choice of \"heads\", and after 30 minutes of deliberation submitted a $304 million bid. ABC's representative Arledge made a quick phone call to executive Fred Pierce, and ABC submitted a $309 million bid exceeded the NBC bid by $5 million. ABC's record setting bid was immediately controversial, first Arledge had exceeded the maximum allowable bid set by ABC's executives by $34 million, and in the coming weeks ABC's coverage of the 1984 Winter Olympics which cost $91.5 million returned poor Nielsen ratings. Early estimates speculated the network would lose $50-$60 million televising the games. The \"Wall Street Journal\" described the NBC agreement as the \"biggest prize of the [1984] Winter Olympics\". The deal, at the time the highest amount ever paid for a sporting event, allowed organizers to announce the Games would be debt-free.\nThe ABC television contract would be void if the Winter Games were cancelled or postponed past March 1, 1988, if the Games were moved to a location outside of Western Canada, or if the United States Olympic Team declined to participate. The contract also allowed for a reduction in payments by ABC if events or days were cancelled, the broadcast signal from Calgary did not operate properly, OCO'88 failed to provide adequate facilities, or if a boycott occurred. OCO'88 mitigated the risk by taking out a million insurance policy on the ABC contract. The exclusive radio broadcast rights were later awarded to ABC for $1.\nShortly after the ABC agreement was finalized, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) made legal threats to the IOC, OCO'88 and Seoul organizing committee insisting on financial compensation for the USOC's consent for Olympic telecasts to occur in the United States. The USOC argument was the use of Olympic emblems in commercial advertising in the United States threatened the program's domestic sponsorship programs. A legal opinion from the Seoul organizing committee lawyer Don Petroni stated the USOC claim had merit under the \"Amateur Sports Act\", and IOC director of legal affairs Howard Stupp confirmed Petroni's opinion. An agreement was reached where OCO'88 paid the USOC million for rights to broadcast the Games in the United States.\nABC planned for 98 hours of coverage, and 53 hours of prime-time coverage for the 1988 Winter Olympics, which allowed the broadcaster to sell approximately 1,800 30-second commercial spots in prime-time. ABC estimated the games would bring in a prime-time rating of 21.5. After the Games, Nielsen noted that ABC's coverage of the Calgary Olympic Games allowed the network to win the \"February Sweeps\" with an average rating of 17.3/27, and an Olympic prime-time average rating of 19.3/30, significantly higher than the 1984 Sarajevo Games prime-time ratings of 18.4/30.\nWestern Europe.\nThe negotiations with American television broadcasters was in sharp contrast to negotiations for Western European rights with the European Broadcasting Union quickly closing an exclusive deal with the IOC for million led by Juan Antonio Samaranch and Marc Hodler on behalf of the IOC. The \"Calgary Herald\" headline after the announcement negatively reflected on the \"bargain\" the European network received, and OCO'88 chairman Frank King publicly expressed his disappointment with the IOC. King expected the Western European rights to bring around million. Samaranch's argument for providing for a privileged negotiation with EBU was ensuring European viewers had equal access and coverage of the games, something he did not believe would occur if private networks from each nation were provided the opportunity to bid. Dick Pound was critical of the decision and argued more revenue could be brought in from British and Italian networks alone and the privileged status suppressed the willingness of the EBU to make a market value bid on the games."

        "title": "1991 Duke vs. UNLV men's basketball game",
        "text": "On March 30, 1991, during the national semifinal of the 1991 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the Duke University Blue Devils played a college basketball game against the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) Runnin' Rebels at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. The Blue Devils, who were seeded 2nd in the Midwest regional bracket, faced the Runnin' Rebels, who were seeded 1st in the West.\nUNLV entered the game on a 45-game winning streak and were strong favorites to win the whole tournament, especially given their 30-point trouncing of Duke in the previous year's championship game. However, Duke managed to scrape out a 79–77 win, advancing them to the championship game which they also won.\nThe game is frequently recognized as one of the best in the NCAA tournament's history.\nBackground.\nDuke entered the NCAA tournament with a 26–7 season record. They were ranked 6th in both major polls, and entered the tournament with an at-large bid. They advanced to the semifinal game with relative ease, defeating Northeast Louisiana, Iowa, Connecticut, and St. John's each by margins of 14 or more points.\nUNLV came into the tournament as reigning champions from the previous year, having beaten Duke in the 1990 championship game 103–73 in one of the most lopsided championship games in tournament history. and earned an automatic bid to the tournament by winning the Big West Conference tournament. Coming into the game, the Runnin' Rebels were on a 45-game winning streak that had begun the previous season and were looking to become the first Division I undefeated national champion since Indiana in 1976.\nUNLV had come under investigation for violating numerous NCAA regulations and was actually barred from the 1991 NCAA tournament, but a deal was struck where the Runnin' Rebels would be allowed to enter the 1991 tournament but not the 1992 one.\nAt one of UNLV's final practices before the game, Tarkanian felt the Runnin' Rebels were off their best and told them in a huddle that they would lose because they were not focused.\nBefore the game, Duke got word of the result from the earlier semifinal: archrival North Carolina had lost to Kansas (coached by the Tar Heels' former assistant and future head coach Roy Williams) 79–73 in what was the first appearance of both halves of the Carolina–Duke rivalry in the Final Four (to date, the two teams had only met once in the postseason in the 1971 NIT and would not meet in the NCAA tournament until the 2022 Final Four). Krzyzewski asked the Duke team if they felt it was okay to lose since that meant they would do no worse than the Tar Heels, and some nodded. Krzyzewski understood but then added, \"Flush it. Let's go kick their ass.\"\nBroadcast.\nThe game was broadcast nationally on CBS with Jim Nantz (in his first Final Four) and Billy Packer providing commentary. Lesley Visser served as sideline reporter.\nGame summary.\nDuke made their first five shots to pull out to an early 13–5 lead. UNLV soon caught up and was leading 43–41 at halftime. Duke kept the game close and held a narrow lead for portions of the second half, and with just under 4 minutes to go, Greg Anthony drove for a layup while on 4 fouls against Brian Davis and was called for charging, which fouled Anthony out of the game and deprived UNLV of their most experienced ball-handler. Despite this, with 2:31 remaining, UNLV took a 76–71 lead via a tip-in by George Ackles to cap a 6–0 run. Bobby Hurley, however, responded quickly with a 3-pointer to bring the Blue Devils back to within 2. After a UNLV shot clock violation, Davis made a driving layup while being fouled by Johnson and proceeded to convert the 3-point play to give Duke a 77–76 lead with 1:02 remaining.\nStacey Augmon then missed a shot, but Larry Johnson was fouled on the offensive rebound by Grant Hill. Johnson missed both free throws initially but made the second after a Thomas Hill lane violation forced a retake, tying the game at 77–77. Thomas Hill then missed a pull-up shot on the next Duke possession, but Christian Laettner was fouled on the rebound by Evric Gray with 12.7 seconds left. The Runnin' Rebels called a timeout, and when Krzyzewski asked Laettner if he had it, Laettner responded, \"I got 'em.\" He then proceeded to make both free throws to put the Blue Devils back ahead 79–77.\nOn UNLV's final possession, Johnson brought the ball up and considered shooting from the right side over Laettner but passed to Anderson Hunt near the top of the 3-point arc, and Hunt's 3-pointer over Hurley and Laettner missed and was rebounded by Hurley as time expired. Subsequently, Johnson's phone answering machine message included an acknowledgment that he should have taken the last shot.\nAftermath.\nDuke then proceeded to defeat Kansas 72–65 in the championship game, marking the first-ever national championship for both the school and Mike Krzyzewski. The following year, Duke accomplished what they prevented UNLV from doing and repeated as national champions, becoming the first team to do so since UCLA in 1972 and 1973.\nMeanwhile, Jerry Tarkanian was forced out as UNLV head coach in 1992 by then–school president Robert Maxson after the Runnin' Rebels won their tenth consecutive Big West Conference regular season title but were barred from returning NCAA tournament by the terms of their probation settlement. In 1998, Tarkanian received a $2.5 million out of court settlement from the NCAA after he had filed a lawsuit for violations stemming from the NCAA investigation of UNLV. In 2005, the basketball court at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas was renamed Jerry Tarkanian Court.\nLegacy.\nDuke vs. UNLV is often noted as one of the best games in the history of the NCAA tournament. In 2012, \"Bleacher Report\" ranked it as the #1 game in tournament history, and in 2020, the Associated Press rated it the tournament's 5th best game. As of the start of the 2022 tournament, Duke's victory against UNLV as a 9.5 point underdog has only been matched once in terms of Final Four underdog victories: by Connecticut's win over Duke in the 1999 national championship game."

The Southern Pines Elks Club owned the course between 1951 and 2020. Southern Pines was purchased in 2020 and renovated by architect Kyle Franz in 2021 as a 6,900 yard par 70 course.\nHistory.\nSouthern Pines had been settled by Scottish immigrants in the 19th century and the first golf course opened in 1896. \nThe town of Southern Pines formally opened the Southern Pines Country Club in 1907 adjacent to the Piney Woods Inn. At the time, the course’s layout was credited to J. N. Peacock and James McNabb, both of whom were assistants to Donald Ross. The precise configuration of the earliest version of SPGC is unknown. The course was 36 holes by 1929 although by 1935 it had dropped back to 27 holes.\nMike Sherman, a Connecticut businessman, owned the course in the years following World War II. \nSam Snead set a course record of 63, eight strokes under par on November 8, 1946 in the Southern Pines open to Ben Hogan's 71. Snead broke the course record of 66, set by Johnny Schooner in 1939. The course was then 6,340 yards.\nThe Southern Pines Elks Club bought the course in 1951. \nIn December 2019, the Southern Pines Elk Club agreed to sell the golf course, clubhouse, lodge building, pool and 100-acres of land to Kaveri Investments in partnership with the owners of Pine Needles in Pinehurst and the Pine Needles Lodge and Golf Club, also in Southern Pines.\nThe Club was sold in July 2020 and architect Kyle Franz retained to renovate the course. Franz increased the green surface, built sandscapes, and removed 700 trees to open vistas through the course and accentuate the course's elevation changes. Franz also recreated Southern Pines’ “lost hole,” which Ross had built between 1911 and 1913 in addition to the 18-hole course.\nThe course reopened in September 2021 with an approximately 6,900-yards, par-70 layout including “the lost hole,” as a bonus 140 yards par 3 designed with an adjacent sand green recreating the original putting surfaces installed by Ross in the 1910s before the advent of Bermuda grass greens in the 1930s.\nSpring Training.\n The Philadelphia Phillies held spring training at the Southern Pines Country Club in 1909, 1910, and 1913, and the Federal League’s Baltimore Terrapins in 1914. Both teams played on the baseball field constructed along a side of the course on the Club's grounds.\nThe Phillies had held spring training in Savannah, Georgia from 1906 to 1908. In January 1909, Southern Pines community leaders wrote Phillies business manager Bill Shettsline asking that he visit and consider the town for spring training. The town renovated the ball field's grandstand, adding three additional tiers of seating, new floors, braced the stands inside and out, and erected a canopy of canvas to shield the sun. Baseball was unpopular with the Club’s golfers who objected to the foul balls and other interruptions. \nA Phillies intrasquad game on March 9, 1909 drew 5,000 spectators in the stands and bleachers.\nPhillies owner Horace Fogel considered the purchase of ten acres in Southern Pines in March 1910 to build a permanent spring training home for the Phillies to include a playing field and building to accommodate the full team and traveling party.\nExternal links.\nOfficial website of the Southern Pines Golf Club"

Construction began in 1997 and took five years, with the centre opening in June 2002. Facilities at the centre included the development centre, administrative hub and indoor cricket nets. Trinidad and Tobago first played at the ground in a first-class match against West Indies B in the 2002–03 Carib Beer Cup, with ground being intermittently used for first-class fixtures by Trinidad until 2010. In March 2003, the centre played host to a Women's One Day International between West Indies women and Sri Lanka women. The centre was one of three venues selected in Trinidad as practice venues for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. In November 2007, plans were unveiled to install floodlights and to erect a multipurpose pavilion with a seating capacity of 3,000. Major cricket returned to the centre in 2015, following a five-year hiatus. In January 2015, the centre hosted its first List A one-day match between the Leeward Islands and the West Indies under-19 team in the Regional Super50, with the centre hosting a further neutral match in that seasons competition. A further two neutral one-day matches were played there in the Regional Super50. First-class cricket too returned to the centre, with Trinidad and Tobago playing a further five first-class matches there in 2015 and 2016. An access road at the centre was named in honour of Sonny Ramadhin, following his death in February 2022."

He previously played for the NC State Wolfpack.\nAmateur career.\nWhite grew up in St. Pete Beach, Florida and initially attended Calvary Christian High School. As a junior, he batted .444 with 18 RBIs and four home runs in 11 games before the season was cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic. He transferred to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida prior to his senior year. White batted .378 and was named an All-American in his only season at IMG.\nWhite was named NC State's starting first baseman entering his freshman year. He garnered national attention after batting .588 with nine home runs in his first eight collegiate games. White set records for the most home runs by a NC State player and the most by a freshman in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since the introduction of the BBCOR standard for bats in 2011. He later hit his 23rd home run to break the overall ACC freshman home run record set by Florida State's Chris Diaz in 1998. White was named the ACC Freshman of the Year. After his freshman campaign, in which the Wolfpack failed to make the NCAA tournament despite a strong regular season, White entered the NCAA transfer portal.\nWhite ultimately committed to transfer to Louisiana State."

Rushden also field a Sunday XI team who play friendly matches in and around the region.\nGround.\nRushden and Higham Town's First and Second XI teams play their home matches at the Town Ground in Rushden, rated as 'Good' quality ground by the East Northamptonshire Council (ENC). The Town Ground was used by Northamptonshire County Cricket Club for 22 first-class matches between 1924 and 1963, but has been the home ground for Rushden since 2003. The Third XI team use the Saffron Road Recreation Ground, in Higham Ferrers, Rushden, rated as a 'Standard' quality ground by the East Northamptonshire Council. \nHistory.\nEvidence shows that cricket has been played in Rushden since the middle of the 19th century, with a record of a match being played as early as 1868. One of the earliest known references to a cricket ground was mentioned in a match report dated 1 August 1874, in the Northampton Mercury stating \"Pikehills\" to be the location and by the 1880s, reports show Rushden Cricket Club winning their second County Challenge Cup in 1884. By 1889, Rushden Cricket Club amalgamated with both the local Football and Rugby club to become the 'Rushden Cricket and Football Club'; and the club moved to their current ground in the same year. By the 1920s Rushden were competing in the Rushden and District League and after the Second World War, they joined the Northamptonshire County League; becoming league champions in 1959 and 1960. Further success was achieved in the Bedford and District Cricket League with the club becoming league champions in 1966. In the 1970s, the club played for the Bedfordshire Millman Trophy and continued competing in the Northants County League up to the turn of the millennium, when the League became a designated ECB Premier League. It was at this time when the club's 120-year-old pavilion was destroyed by fire, along with most of the club's material history in 2000. However, a few years into the millennium saw the club bounce back with the addition of two senior teams (3rd XI side in 2007 and a 4th XI in 2012) and a cluster of division wins leading up to the club becoming Premier League Champions in 2015. After the 2018 season, Rushden Town entered into a merger with its neighbouring club 'Higham Ferrers Town' and became Rushden and Higham Town Cricket Club.\nClub Performance.\nThe Northamptonshire Cricket League competition results showing the club's positions in the league (by Division) since 2003."

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2022 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), \"Sporting News\" (SN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose three teams, while AP and USBWA also list honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2022 College Basketball All-American team was determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by SN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans. Other All-American lists include those determined by USA Today, Fox Sports, Yahoo Sports and many others. The scholar-athletes selected by the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) are termed Academic All-Americans.\nIndividual All-America teams.\nBy team.\nAP Honorable Mention:\nUSBWA Honorable Mention:\nAcademic All-Americans.\nThe College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) announced its 15-member 2021 Academic All-America team on March 15, 2022, divided into first, second and third teams, with Ben Vander Plas of Ohio chosen as men's college basketball Academic All-American of the Year.\nSenior All-Americans.\nThe 10 finalists for the Senior CLASS Award, called Senior All-Americans, were announced on February 10, 2022.

The series consisted of four legs across three continents and featured solo, duet, and team artistic swimming events in female, male, and mixed categories. It was the final edition to use the name FINA Artistic Swimming World Series preceding a change of competition name on 9 December 2022 to FINA Artistic Swimming World Cup for the 2023 edition.\nMixed gender team events featured up to two men per team. In December 2022, following the conclusion of World Series, the International Olympic Committee announced it would be allowing men to compete in artistic swimming for the first time only in mixed gender teams events at the 2024 Olympic Games, using the same format for team composition, up to two men, as the World Series.\nFrom 21 April through the end of the World Series, athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus were banned from participating due to the 2022 Russia invasion of Ukraine.\nSchedule.\nOriginally the World Series was scheduled to include five legs across three continents, including a first ever joint hosting of a FINA Artistic Swimming World Series leg and a FINA Diving World Series leg in Kazan, Russia for the third leg in May 2022. However, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started on 24 February 2022, FINA canceled the leg of the World Series scheduled to take place in Kazan out of concern for the safety and well-being of participating athletes. To ensure the safety of participants, FINA required athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus to compete under neutral labels (no country name, flag, anthem, etc.) during competition. The designation \"Independent FINA Athlete\" (IFA) was the neutral term for competitors from the two countries. After initially allowing athletes and officials from both countries to participate as neutrals, FINA reversed its decision and banned the athletes and officials altogether effective 21 April 2022 through the end of competition. The updated schedule included the four non-canceled legs.\nMedal summary.\nEach National Swimming Federation was permitted multiple entrants in individual and duet events, however, medals were awarded to the top three competitors in each event, with only the highest scoring competitor from each National Swimming Federation eligible for a final ranking and medal.\nParticipating countries.\nAthletes from the following 40 countries competed in the World Series.\nNational Swimming Federation withdrawals.\nOn 18 March 2022, the German Swimming Federation withdrew its athletes from the World Series. The German Swimming Federation rejoined the World Series in April on the fourth leg.\nOn 23 March 2022, the Russian Swimming Federation pulled all athletes from FINA events for the rest of the duration of the 2022 year, including the World Series. A little under one month later, on 21 April 2022, FINA banned all athletes and officials from Russia and Belarus from the World Series."

The Yellow Jackets represented American International College and were coached by Eric Lang, in his 2nd season.\nSeason.\nAmerican International began its second season under Eric Lang rather poorly; the Yellow Jackets won just 1 of their first 9 games and looked destined to compile yet another poor record. However, in mid-November, after making freshman Stefano Durante the starting goaltender, AIC began to improve. While the offense was never strong, it was serviceable for much of the year and an improved defensive effort allowed the Yellow Jackets to start winning game more often. The team was never able to put together a long stretch of wins but, after such a bad start, .500-hockey was a vast improvement.\nAmerican International finished the season 8th in the Atlantic Hockey standings, their best result in over a decade. While they possessed a losing record, AIC managed to earn its first home playoff game since 1990. While they got a fight from Niagara, the Yellow Jackets won both games to win a postseason series for the first time in eleven years.\nThe 15 wins recorded on the year were the most in any one season by the program since it had joined Division I in 1999. The sizable improvement for the team was spearheaded by the addition of Brennan Kapcheck and Stefano Durante, two freshman that the program would conceivably be able to build around for the near future.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

At the age of 25, with the financial help of his father, he opened a bookstore on Stanley Street. A Trotskyist, he had no incentive for profit and often gave books away to customers, driving him into bankruptcy.\nWhile studying in France in 1969, Silverman discovered great enjoyment from cycling. Encouraged by his wife, Edith, he rode his bicycle to his French lessons. Upon his return to Montreal in 1970, he purchased a second-hand bicycle during an era in which cycling in the city was rare. In 1975, he co-founded the group to fight for better bicycle safety in Montreal. In 1977, he attempted to organize an international cycling foundation, saying \"Cyclists of all countries, unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains! Let's build International Cycling\". He proposed the creation of a multilingual library and an international liaison bulletin.\nSilverman died in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts on 20 February 2022, at the age of 88."

This was also Bryant's final season in the NEC, as the school joined the America East Conference that July.\nSeeds.\nAll nine of the eligible teams in the conference qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.\nThe tiebreakers used by the NEC are 1) head-to-head records of teams with identical records, 2) comparison of records against individual teams in the conference starting with the top-ranked team(s) and working down and 3) NCAA NET Rankings available on day following the conclusion of Northeast Conference regular-season play. The round-robin record tiebreaker was used to place Saint Francis (PA), Fairleigh Dickinson, and Central Connecticut in that order for the last three seeds.\nAwards and honors.\nTournament MVP: Peter Kiss\nChampionship game brawl.\nDuring the Championship game between Bryant and Wagner, a fight between fans of both teams broke out with 4:37 left in the second half. The altercation lasted almost half an hour resulting in many fans being escorted out in addition to Wagner guard Will Martinez being ejected from the game. The game was later resumed resulting in a 70–43 Bryant victory. Before the Bryant fans would be able to storm the court, Wagner had to exit the floor to prevent any more conflict. After the game, 20-year-old Bryant student Connor Gleim was arrested by the Rhode Island State Police. Gleim was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing an officer in execution of duty."

        "text": "The Minnesota–Minnesota Duluth men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey and Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey programs. The first meeting between the two occurred on 13 December 1952 but wasn't played annually until 1962.\nHistory.\nMinnesota was one for the first 'western' teams to play college ice hockey when they held their first official game in January of 1922. Less than a decade later, Duluth State Teachers College founded their own varsity team, however, due in part to the Great Depression, the program lasted only two years before being mothballed. After World War II the school decided to being the team back and they began playing in the MIAC. Over the succeeding 15 years, the two teams only played a single game against one another, primarily because MIAC teams were considered 'lower-tier' programs and the University of Minnesota was among the 'higher-tier' clubs.\nIn 1961, after winning 9 consecutive MIAC championships, UMD decided to raise the profile of its ice hockey program and left the MIAC. Over the next four years, while playing as an independent, the Bulldogs began an annual series with Minnesota and quickly gained acceptance by the other western programs. Minnesota Duluth joined the WCHA in 1965 and became a conference rival of Minnesota's for most of the next fifty years. During this period, Minnesota had a decided advantage in terms of wins and losses though Duluth got their fair share as well.\nIn 2013, as a result of the Big Ten Conference forming an ice hockey division, Minnesota and Minnesota Duluth ended up in different conferences. To help continue their long-standing rivalry, the North Star College Cup was organized between four schools from Minnesota. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough interest in the tournament to keep it going after four years. Instead, the two programs began holding a home-and-home series at the beginning of the year. They have done so every years beginning in 2017 with the exception of the 2020–21 season. That year the series was not allowed due to the moratorium on non-conference play resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

In each case the trophies were handed out the winners of those Championships conform the deed's of gift. &lt;BR&gt;\nUnfortunately the race committee made in 2012 the mistake to hand out the \"Swedish Soling Association’s Perpetual Prize\", as result of the fact that the deed of gift was lost, to the first European team. As result the names of Karl Haist, Martin Zeileis and Patrick Wichmann were engraved on the trophy. \n Later after scanning of the paper archive of former secretary Dinny Read the deed of gift emerged.\nAfter this incident a new trophy was introduced in case there is a NON-European, European Champion. This perpetual \"Best European Team Trophy\" will be handed out to the first ranked team where all team members have a European nationality based on the geological definition of Europe. Their names will be engraved on the backplane of this new trophy. Sofar (16 February 2022) this trophy is not used.\nFurther results.\nFor further results see:"

        "title": "Logo of the Welsh Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Welsh Rugby Union logo is the emblem used by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and has become associated with Wales. The emblem is based on the Prince of Wales's feathers, a heraldic badge associated with the Prince of Wales since the early 17th century by British holders of the title, however the badge's English origin has prompted calls by some Welsh people for the WRU to change their logo for a design more historically linked to Wales. The use of the feathers by the WRU date back to its founding, with a stylistic modification of the logo taking place in the 1990s.\nDescription.\nThe current emblem used by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) is based on the Prince of Wales's feathers which features a gold coronet with three white (or silver) ostrich feathers behind it.\nThe emblem is used to represent the Prince of Wales, although as the emblem is applied prior to the official investiture of the title Prince of Wales, it is \"technically the [heraldic] badge of the Duke of Cornwall, or Heir Apparent\". The emblem has its origins with English royal Edward the Black Prince in the 14th century, who inherited the standard and the emblem's motto from Queen Phillipa, his mother. The emblem has been associated with the Prince of Wales since the early 17th century, although associated with English holders of the title, as it was not associated with Princes of Wales that were native-born to Wales, the last being Owain Glyndŵr who died around 1415. The design of the three feathers are said to be based on the French Fleur de Lys.\nIn the 1990s, the badge used by the WRU was modified to become more stylised, replacing \"Ich dien\" (; from German), present on the heraldic badge, with \"WRU\" on the sporting body's emblem. This was done to allow the WRU to copyright the logo.\nUse.\nThe three feathers design has since become widespread in Wales, present on various Welsh products, represented the Welch Regiment in the British Army, and as the symbol of the Welsh Rugby Union. Its later \"widespread use\" once caused then Prince of Wales, Charles to launch a \"clampdown\". With letters sent from Buckingham Palace in 2007 to several Welsh companies for them to stop selling items with the emblem, as the emblem is the \"personal property of the Prince of Wales\". Companies that are granted a Royal Warrant are those only entitled to display the three feathers on their products. The symbol has become a \"badge of pride\" in Wales by some, alongside other national symbols of Wales such as the Welsh dragon, leek and daffodil.\nThe emblem baring the three feathers has been used by the WRU since 1881, being present during Wales' first international against England. However in 1899, a leek was used to represent Welsh rugby rather than the current three feathers. On the crest for the Anglo-Australia team as part of the 1899 British Lions tour to Australia, four symbols represented the Home Nations of the United Kingdom, with two crossed leeks used to represent Wales.\nHowever, the current three feathers symbol later became the main emblem used in Welsh rugby, with a World Rugby Museum volunteer stating \"It is thought that the WRU picked the Prince of Wales Feathers over the leek as their symbol in the nineteenth century as a demonstration of loyalty to Britain and her empire\" and that the Welsh were \"not very\" close to having leeks become the symbol of the Welsh Rugby Union. The badge of the British &amp; Irish Lions currently contains the three feathers to represent Wales among the other three home nations.\nControversy of the logo.\nThe use of the three feathers is seen by some as oppressive as it serves as reminder for them of English rule in Wales, or as subjugating and shameful, sometimes emphasised when the rugby team are not performing well. These connotations have prompted some calls for the WRU to change their emblem. With various petitions set up advocating for the change of the crest to another design, such as a dragon in place of the three feathers. The emblem has been described as \"inappropriate\" for Welsh nationalists and republicans in its usage to represent \"a team that is itself an icon of Wales\", due to the badge's association with the Prince of Wales title and its use in the British Armed Forces.\nWhen questioned by the Daily Post, some fans critical of the logo stated it is \"an outdated symbol with three German feathers which represents England [...] nothing to do with Welsh heritage\", and that the Wales national football team \"represents the country so much better when it comes to language, heritage and culture\". Supporters for retaining the current logo state \"it is now internationally recognised [...] as being the WRU logo\". The use of the three feathers by Wrexham A.F.C. was also questioned, with critics stating it \"belongs in the past\" and removing the feathers \"would be a welcome addition\", although a supporter for the feathers' use stated \"it's surely evolved to symbolise something else now\".\nPotential replacements.\nIn November 2021, an e-petition for replacing the feathers with another Welsh symbol, such as a dragon, gained traction following the rugby team's defeat to New Zealand reaching above 4,000 signatures at the time.\nAside various mentions of a dragon to be used as a potential replacement. In October 2021, pro-independence group YesCymru presented mock-up alternatives to the WRU logo utilising different Welsh symbols, such as a leek, daffodil, and harp. The proposals received \"mixed reviews\" on social media."

        "text": "In Ulster Rugby's fourth season since the advent of professionalism, they were champions of the Heineken Cup, and finished second in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship.\nHarry Williams was appointed as Director of Rugby, signing a three-year full time contract, starting on 1 July when he resigned as principal of Holywood Primary School. A former prop for Malone and Bangor, Williams had coached Bangor to Ulster League and Cup titles in the 1980s. He was Ulster's coach for four years from 1987, and had led them to four unbeaten seasons in the Interprovincial Championship. He was part of the Irish development squad coaching team for their tour of New Zealand in 1993, and was Ireland A coach for three years. Most recently, he was coach of Dublin side Bective Rangers for 18 months, before resigning for family reasons at the end of 1998. Former Ireland fullback Colin Wilkinson was assistant coach, and Harry Brennan was strength and conditioning coach.\nWarren Gatland, the new Ireland coach, led a drive by the IRFU to bring Irish players who had signed contracts with English clubs back to Ireland. Ulster were strengthened by the return of out-half David Humphreys and centre Mark McCall from London Irish, centre Jonny Bell and hooker Allen Clarke from Northampton, and lock Mark Blair from Edinburgh, but locks Paddy Johns and Jeremy Davidson rejected the IRFU approach, Johns staying at Saracens, Davidson moving from London Irish to Castres. Two English-born Irish internationals were also signed: fullback Simon Mason from Richmond, and prop Justin Fitzpatrick from London Irish.\nThe IRFU announced that the Irish provinces would have squads of 30 players, most of whom would be full-time professionals, for the coming season. The IRFU Ulster Branch signed 19 full-time players for the 1998–99 season, including Jonny Bell, Justin Fitzpatrick, Allen Clarke, David Humphreys, Simon Mason, Maurice Field, Denis McBride, Stephen Ritchie, James Topping and Gary Longwell, while younger players like Robin Morrow and Sheldon Coulter were signed to part-time contracts.\nMark McCall was named as captain, but sustained a career-ending injury in a friendly against Glasgow on 28 September.\nUlster's Heineken Cup campaign started with a draw against Edinburgh, followed by a heavy defeat away to Toulouse. When the players reacted with relief that the scoreline was not as extreme as the 108–16 defeat Toulouse had recently inflicted on Ebbw Vale, Williams was furious. Training was revamped: where previously the team had trained in the early mornings and evenings to accommodate part-time players, daytime sessions were introduced for full-time professionals, with one evening session a week for the part-timers. Ulster defeated Ebbw Vale, and then Toulouse at home, in front of Ravenhill's biggest crowd for several years, and were unbeaten for the remainder of the pool stage. With Ebbw Vale beating Toulouse 19–11 at home in their final game, Ulster topped the pool with an away win over Edinburgh.\nThey drew Toulouse at home in the quarter-finals. In the second half, with Ulster narrowly in the lead, flanker Andy Ward received word that his wife had gone into labour, and left the field, replaced by Derek Topping. Toulouse almost took the lead, if not for a late try-saving tackle on Michel Marfaing by David Humphreys, who injured his shoulder in the process. Bryn Cunningham replaced him, and Ulster held on to win. This was followed by a home semi-final against Stade Francais, with Ravenhill's capacity increased to 20,000 with temporary stands. It featured a memorable try from Humphreys – from his own 22, he chipped the ball forward to Sheldon Coulter, who passed it back to Humphreys to run it in from the halfway line – as well as five penalties, a conversion and a drop goal from Simon Mason, in a 33–27 victory. In the final, held at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, Ulster defeated Colomiers 21–6 to become the first Irish side to lift the Heineken Cup.\nJonny Bell, Jeremy Davidson, Justin Fitzpatrick, David Humphreys, Eric Miller and Andy Ward were selected in the Ireland squad for the 1999 Five Nations Championship. Bell, Humphreys, Davidson, Fitzpatrick and Ward were selected for the 1999 tour to Australia.\n1998–99 IRFU Interprovincial Championship.\nTop three teams qualify for next season's Heineken Cup.\nUlster Rugby Awards.\nThe IRFU Ulster Branch Awards ceremony was held on 27 May 1999 at the Balmoral Conference Centre.

        "text": "The Super Bowl XXXIII halftime show was a performance that took place at the halftime of Super Bowl XXXIII.\nThe show was titled \"A Celebration of Soul, Salsa and Swing\" and featured Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Stevie Wonder, and Gloria Estefan.\nProduction.\nA native to the Super Bowl host city of Miami, Estefan had previously performed at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXVI.\nThe halftime show was sponsored by Progressive Auto Insurance. Progressive, in doing so, was the first auto insurer to be the title sponsor of a Super Bowl halftime show. The show was produced by Radio City Productions. The show featured 1,000 performers. Effects included large lighted balloon balls, lasers, pyrotechnics.\nThe show took place around the time of the end of commercial success of the swing revival. Music journalist Rob Sheffield has likened it to marking an end of 1990s music culture in the same that many regard the Altamont Free Concert as marking an end of the 1960s youth culture, remarking, \"in a way, this halftime show did for the '90s what Altamont did for the '60s\".\nSynopsis.\nThe show was preceded with a brief skit featuring Estefan and Wonder with the character E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, who had appeared in Super Bowl advertisements run that night for the show's title sponsor Progressive Auto Insurance.\nThe performance began with Big Bad Voodoo Daddy performing \"Go Daddy-O\".\nWonder then entered the field in a vintage automobile, while performing \"Sir Duke\". He sat at a keyboard and performed \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life\". During this song, dancers unrolled large swaths of cloth to form an image of a sun on the field. He then performed \"I Wish\", during which he was joined on stage by tap dancer Savion Glover. Wonder briefly joined Savion in tap dancing.\nThe performance then saw Miami native Estefan make her entrance. She sang \"Oye!\" followed by \"Turn the Beat Around\". During \"Turn the Beat Around\", dancers on the field swung long lighted ropes.\nThe performance ended with Wonder and Estefan both performing \"You'll Be Mine (Party Time)\". During this final song, Wonder wore a jacket with the word \"African\" on one sleeve and the word \"American\" on the other."

        "text": "Ronald Simpson is an American former professional basketball player and currently serves as a youth league coach. He had a standout college career at Rider University in which he was the 1987 East Coast Conference co-Player of the Year. As of 2021–22, Simpson serves as the founder and CEO of the South Jersey Titans AAU basketball program as well as the athletic coordinator for the Robbinsville Township, New Jersey Recreation Department.\nPlaying career.\nHigh school and college.\nA native of Montclair, New Jersey, Simpson attended Immaculate Conception High School where he became the school's boys' basketball all-time leading scorer. He would later be inducted into Immaculate's hall of fame. Simpson graduated in 1983 and went to play for Adelphi University, an NCAA Division II school in nearby Garden City, New York. In his freshman season, the only one in which he would play for Adelphi before transferring, he averaged 18 points and 8 rebounds per game and was named to the Division II All-Metro First Team.\nSimpson then transferred to Division I school Rider in Lawrence Township, New Jersey. He redshirted (sat out) the 1984–85 season. As a sophomore in 1985–86 he averaged 16.6 points and 1.2 steals per game, making an immediate impact for the Broncs. The following season, Simpson's best of his collegiate career, he averaged 23.2 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. The 1986–87 was also the first season in which the NCAA implemented three-pointers, and Simpson took advantage by setting still-standing Rider records for made threes in a game (9) and season (98). He became the first Rider player to score 1,000 career points within his first two seasons. The East Coast Conference named him to their all-conference first-team, and alongside Lehigh's Daren Queenan he was named the ECC co-Player of the Year. In Simpson's senior season at Rider in 1987–88, he averaged 22.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game. Despite putting up good numbers he did not attain the same recognition as his junior year, failing to repeat as the player of the year and was relegated to the All-ECC Second Team.\nAmong Rider's 1,000-point scorers, Simpsons' 20.0 career points per game average is the highest of all-time. He scored 1,735 points in just three seasons, which as of 2021–22 is still in the program's top 10. The 660 points he scored in his senior season once stood as a single-season school record. In 2010, Rider inducted Simpson into their athletics hall of fame.\nProfessional.\nSimpson went undrafted in the 1988 NBA draft. He instead went overseas to play professional and France but did not enjoy the expatriate lifestyle. He returned stateside and tried out for the former United States Basketball League (USBL) but did not make a team. It was then he decided to quite pursuing playing professional basketball and look toward a different career.\nLater life.\nFrom 1993 to 2013, Simpson served in the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice. He was a sergeant in the street gang unit where he led many investigations, presentations and trainings. He stayed actively involved in the community and also served as a basketball coach in various youth leagues, middle schools, high schools, and even at the junior college level (Mercer County Community College). Since 2015 he has overseen the growth of an Amateur Athletic Union basketball program, the South Jersey Titans. Simpson also concurrently serves as the athletic coordinator for the Robbinsville Township Recreation Department."

A native of Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, Smith starred at South Shore High School before finding success at the collegiate level. He first competed for San Jacinto College (SJC), a junior college in Pasadena, Texas, from 1990 to 1992 before his two-year stint at Northeastern Illinois (1992–94).\nDuring Smith's freshman season at San Jacinto he was named to the All-Texas Junior College Athletic Conference First Team as well as the All-TJCAC Tournament Team. Smith was also a teammate of future NBA star Sam Cassell.\nSmith signed to play basketball at the University of New Orleans after his time at SJC.

The Seawolves represented the University of Alaska Anchorage and were coached by Matt Thomas, in his 5th season.\nSeason.\nAlaska Anchorage entered the season trying to pull out of the tailspin that had begun after Matt Thomas' surprising first season. The team started well, pushing North Dakota into overtime twice, but couldn't get their offense on track over the next few weeks. After finally getting their first win over Lake Superior State, the Seawolves ran off three consecutive wins in mid-November and looked like they may have found a recipe for success.\nUnfortunately, as soon as December rolled around, the offense dried up and Alaska Anchorage lost 19 of their next 20 games. During the run, senior netminder Olivier Mantha did what he could to keep the Seawolves within striking distance, be he was called upon to stop more than 40 shots on multiple occasions. While Brody Claeys got some starts in towards the end of the season, Mantha was in net for the season finale against Alaska and finally got some support when the Seawolves scored a season-high 5 goals. Mantha ended the season as well as his college career on a high note with a second win, salvaging an otherwise terrible season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season"

        "text": "Chris Lewis (born December 13, 1980) is a former American football quarterback.\nEarly life and high school.\nLewis was born and grew up in Long Beach, California and attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, where he played football and volleyball. He was a four-year starter at quarterback and was named All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) as a junior and senior and named first-team All-Moore League three times. As a senior, Lewis completed 174 of 293 pass attempts for 3,170 yards and 43 touchdowns and was named the CIF Offensive Player of the Year and the Gatorade National Player of the Year. He finished his high school career with 8,616 passing yards and a California-record 107 touchdown passes. Lewis committed to play college football at Stanford, where his older sister Robyn was playing volleyball.\nCollege career.\nLewis redshirted his freshman year at Stanford. He began his redshirt freshman season as the backup to starter Randy Fasani. Lewis saw his first significant playing action against fifth-ranked Texas after Fasani suffered an injury and completed 12 of 33 pass attempts for 214 yards and three touchdowns, including a touchdown pass with less than two minutes left put the Cardinal ahead in a 27–24 upset victory. He started the next three games while Fasani recovered from his injury. Lewis finished the season with 1,179 passing yards on 92-for-204 passing with eight touchdown passes and five interceptions. \nLewis began his redshirt sophomore season as the second string quarterback again, but ultimately started four games and passed for 1,277 yards with 12 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He entered the Cardinal's game against fifth-ranked Oregon late in the second quarter following an injury to Fasani and completed 12 of 26 passes for 189 and two touchdowns in a comeback 49–42 victory. Lewis passed for 250 yards and three touchdowns as Stanford won 38–28 over fourth-ranked UCLA. Lewis was named Stanford's starting quarterback going into his redshirt junior year. He missed the season opener after being suspended for a minor NCAA infraction. Lewis started the next five games before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. \nLewis ultimately lost his starting job during the offseason to Trent Edwards. He returned to the starting lineup after Edwards suffered a shoulder injury and started seven games during his redshirt senior season. Lewis finished his collegiate career with 19 starts and 30 total games played, completing 350 of 713 pass attempts for 4,346 yards with 33 touchdown passes and 31 interceptions.\nProfessional career.\nLewis was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Arizona Cardinals on June 7, 2004. He was released at the end of training camp and spent time during the regular season on the Cardinals' practice squad. In 2005, the Cardinals allocated Lewis to the Cologne Centurions of NFL Europe. He played in nine games for Cologne and passed for 412 yards. Lewis was released by the Cardinals on June 24, 2005. Lewis was a member of the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League in 2006."

        "title": "Kirby Puckett's 1991 World Series home run",
        "text": "Kirby Puckett's 1991 World Series home run was a baseball play that occurred in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series on October 26, 1991, at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nGame 6 is widely considered to be one of the greatest World Series games ever played. With the Minnesota Twins facing elimination against the Atlanta Braves, and with the score tied 3–3 in the bottom of the 11th inning, Kirby Puckett stepped up to the plate and drove the game-winning home run off of Charlie Leibrandt into the left field seats to force a decisive Game 7.\nThis famously led to Jack Buck, who was broadcasting the game on CBS television to say \"And we'll see you tomorrow night!\" The home run was Puckett's only walk-off home run of his career.\nBackground.\nSeven players and five of the coaching staff from the 1987 World Champions ultimately repeated as 1991 World Champions. Only one man has been a part of each of the three Minnesota Twins World Series teams: Tony Oliva. An outfielder in 1965, he was the hitting coach on the 1987 team and bench coach in 1991.\nThe Twins surprisingly did quite poorly in 1990, finishing last in the AL West division with a record of 74–88, 29 games behind the Athletics, the eventual World Series runner-up. 1991 brought breakout years from newcomers Shane Mack, Scott Leius, Chili Davis, and rookie of the year Chuck Knoblauch, along with consistently excellent performances from stars Hrbek and Puckett. The pitching staff excelled as well, with 20-game winner Scott Erickson, closer Rick Aguilera, and newly acquired free agent, St. Paul native Jack Morris, having all-star years. They all were contributors to the 1991 Twins' improvement from 74 wins to 95. Kirby Puckett led the way by batting .319, eighth in the league and Minnesota surged past Oakland midseason to capture the division title.\nBobby Cox returned to the Atlanta Braves' dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves would finish the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97, and traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. However, pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft to select Chipper Jones, who would go on to become one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move, however, was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.\nThe following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players Dave Justice, Ron Gant and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion Terry Pendleton, the Braves overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball history's more memorable playoff races. The \"Worst to First\" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and, to a larger degree, the state of Georgia and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag.\nPostseason.\nThe Twins then beat the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the American League Championship Series as Puckett batted .429 with two home runs and five RBI to win the ALCS MVP. Meanwhile, the Braves defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS.\nBraves manager Bobby Cox designated Leibrandt the starter for Game 1 of the World Series against the Minnesota Twins. Leibrandt got the start by virtue of his long post-season rest and the fact he was the only Braves starter who had ever pitched in the Metrodome. Leibrandt lost as he pitched decently but was outpitched by Jack Morris.\nThe setup.\nWorld Series Game 6.\nGoing into Game 6, the Twins trailed three games to two with each team winning their respective home games. Puckett gave the Twins an early lead by driving in Chuck Knoblauch with a triple in the first inning. Puckett then made a leaping catch in front of the Plexiglass wall in left field to rob Ron Gant of an extra-base hit in the third. Puckett ultimately fell a double short of hitting for the cycle, getting two singles, a triple, and the homer.\nThe following box score is of Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.\nThe play.\nThe game went into extra innings, and in the first at-bat of the bottom of the 11th, Puckett hit a dramatic game-winning home run on a 2–1 count off of Charlie Leibrandt to send the Series to Game 7. The first pitch of the inning was a change-up, which Puckett took for strike one. The next one was a similar high and outside fastball, which Puckett took for ball one; pitch three was another fastball for ball two. The fourth pitch, and last pitch of the game, was a weak, high change-up that failed to break. Puckett made solid contact and sprinted for first, as was his usual practice. Only after he saw first base coach Wayne Terwilliger throw up his hands in victory did Puckett realize he had hit a home run. Leibrandt was called upon to enter the game in a highly unfamiliar role – as a reliever late in the extra-inning game, and very late at night.\nCox endured some criticism for the move because the Braves still had several relievers at their disposal including left-hander Kent Mercker and right-handers Jim Clancy and Mark Wohlers, but the move made sense on another level, because Leibrandt was the only pitcher left on their roster who had previous World Series experience, and although Leibrandt had been subpar in his Game 1 start, the three hitters scheduled to bat for the Twins in the 11th had been a combined 0 for 6 against Leibrandt in that game, including two strikeouts of Puckett.\nThe calls.\nJack Buck.\nAs previously mentioned, Jack Buck, who was broadcasting the game for CBS television alongside Tim McCarver, famously called Puckett's home run with the line \"And we'll see you tomorrow night!\". 20 years later, Buck's son Joe, who was broadcasting Game 6 of the World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers, for Fox with McCarver, also said \"...we will see you tomorrow night!\" when describing David Freese's walk-off home run to send that World Series to a decisive seventh game.\nJohn Gordon.\nIn the Minnesota area, radio coverage of the 1991 World Series was broadcast on 830 WCCO AM. This is how John Gordon described Puckett's home run:\nVin Scully.\nCalling the game for a national radio audience on CBS Radio Sports alongside Johnny Bench and John Rooney, this is how Vin Scully described Kirby Puckett's game-winning home run:\nAftermath.\nIn the final and deciding game, Jack Morris pitched a 10-inning shutout, viewed by many baseball historians as one of the greatest pitching performances in a 7th game of the World Series, to beat the Braves 1–0 and bring home the championship to Minnesota. It marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings. The Twins won on a walk-off RBI single by Gene Larkin in the bottom of the 10th inning. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded as one of the greatest games in the history of professional baseball.\n1991 was considered to be the first season that any team that ended in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the unprecedented feat. ESPN rated the 1991 World Series as the best ever played in a 2003 centennial retrospective of the World Series. As with the 1987 World Series, which the Twins also won, all 7 games were won by the home team.\nThe Twins were the first World Series champion to lose three away games and still win the series by winning all four home games; doing it in 1987 and again in 1991. The Arizona Diamondbacks duplicated this feat in 2001, when they became the first National League team to do so.\n1992 saw another superb Athletic team that the Twins could not overcome, despite a 90–72 season and solid pitching from John Smiley. After that season, the Twins again fell into an extended slump, posting a losing record each year for the next eight years: 71–91 in 1993, 50–63 in 1994, 56–88 in 1995, 78–84 in 1996, 68–94 in 1997, 70–92 in 1998, 63–97 in 1999 and 69–93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997, a long sequence of retirements and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins.\nDespite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win. Francisco Cabrera's two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory. It was the first time in post-season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning.\nCharlie Leibrandt again had the opportunity to play in the World Series with the Braves the following year. The Braves lost that series also, this time to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games. In the final game, in circumstances eerily similar to Game 6 of the prior year's Series, Leibrandt was called in as a reliever in an extra-inning game. Just as in 1991, Cox was criticized for using Leibrandt as a reliever with closer Jeff Reardon and relievers Marvin Freeman and David Nied still available. Toronto rallied for two runs in the top of the 11th on a hit by Dave Winfield. The Braves did manage to get one of those runs back in the bottom of the 11th; however, it was not enough and Leibrandt ended up as the losing pitcher.\nThough the Twins didn't make it to the postseason for the rest of Puckett's career, he remained an elite player. In 1994, Puckett was switched to right field and won his first league RBI title by driving in 112 runs in only 108 games; a pace that projects to 168 RBIs over a full season. But the 1994 season was cut short by a players' strike.\nPuckett after the 1995 season was forced to retire at age 35 due to loss of vision in one eye from a central retinal vein occlusion. He retired as the Twins' all-time leader in career hits, runs, doubles, and total bases. At the time of his retirement, his .318 career batting average was the highest by any right-handed American League batter since Joe DiMaggio. Puckett was the fourth baseball player during the 20th century to record 1,000 hits in his first five full calendar years in Major League Baseball, and was the second to record 2,000 hits during his first ten full calendar years. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.\nLegacy.\nThis dramatic game has been widely remembered as the high point in Puckett's career. The images of Puckett rounding the bases, arms raised in triumph, are frequently included in video highlights of his career. After Game 6, the Twins replaced the blue seat back and bottom where the walk-off home run ball was caught with a gold-colored set. Both of these sets remain in the Twins' archives.\nThe Twins reinstalled a blue seat back and bottom as well as Puckett's #34 on the seat where it remained until the final Minnesota Vikings game of 2013 in the Metrodome when, as local media reported, a fan took the #34 plate off the seat. The original home run seat armrests and hardware, as well as the replacement blue seat back and bottom, are now in a private collection of Puckett memorabilia in Minnesota after the Metrodome was torn down."

        "title": "1995–96 Ulster Rugby season",
        "text": "The 1995–96 season was Ulster Rugby's first season under professionalism. Brian Bloomfield was in his second season as coach. 35-year-old Malone RFC centre Bill Harbinson, who first played for Ulster in 1986, was captain, in his final season before retirement from the game. They played six representative matches, defeating Griqualand West, New Zealand Federation U23 and New South Wales, and losing to a Côte Basque Select XV, the and Edinburgh District.\nBackground.\nOn 26 August, rugby union was declared open to professionalism. At this stage the Irish provinces were still representative teams, not professional clubs. Many involved in the game were concerned that domestic clubs could not afford to pay players, who could be lost to professional teams in England. In September, the IRFU confirmed that, for this season, only senior international players would be paid, with a one-year moratorium on payment for club and provincial players. Up to 35 Ireland players would be offered £26,000 contracts for the 1996 Five Nations Championship. That squad included Ulster players Jonathan Bell, Allen Clarke, Jeremy Davidson, Maurice Field, David Humphreys, Paddy Johns, Denis McBride and Mark McCall. As the situation developed, match fees became available for Heineken Cup and Interprovincial matches, with players who appeared in all six matches in line to receive almost £3,000.\nThe inaugural Heineken Cup was launched in the summer of 1995 on the initiative of the Five Nations Committee to provide a new level of cross border competition. Twelve sides representing Ireland, Wales, Italy, Romania and France competed in four pools of three with the group winners going directly into the semi-finals. English and Scottish teams did not take part in the inaugural competition. The IRFU confirmed that Ireland would enter provincial teams, as their clubs were unlikely to be strong enough for the competition. They were initially offered two places, but Tom Kiernan, Ireland's representative on the organising committee, was able to secure a third. The three places would go to the top three teams in the 1994 IRFU Interprovincial Championship, Munster, Ulster and Leinster.\nEvents.\nJonathan Bell, who had impressed with Ireland in the World Cup, was offered contracts to play rugby league by both Sheffield and Halifax, but turned them down to remain available for Ireland, with a long-term goal of selection for the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in two years' time. The former Ballymena player, now studying at Loughborough University, had signed for Northampton but remained available for Ulster. Other Ulster players who featured for Ireland at the World Cup were Paddy Johns, Denis McBride, Maurice Field and Davy Tweed.\nUlster's campaign started in August with a tour to Capbreton, France, to play a Côte Basque Select XV. The French side picked up Ulster's travel and accommodation expenses, in recompense for a scheduled game which was called off at the last minute the previous season when Côte Basque were unable to field a team. Stephen Blake-Knox, the new chairman of selectors, had a limited panel of players to select from, with twelve regular players declaring themselves unavailable. With Simon Booth on honeymoon, Richard Mackey was selected at tighthead prop, with Gary Leslie at loosehead in place of the injured Gary Bell, and Allen Clarke kept his place at hooker. Jeremy Davidson and Gary Longwell made up the second row. New Zealand-born flanker Bruce Cornelius replaced David Erskine, who missed the tour for a job interview, in the back row alongside Kevin McKee and Roger Wilson. Neil Doak, who had made his Ulster debut in February, was selected at scrum-half, with David Humphreys at out-half. Bill Harbinson captained the side, lining up in the centres with Jonathan Bell. Two new faces on the wings were Jan Cunningham, replacing the injured Tyrone Howe, and James Topping, with Stan McDowell playing fullback.\nOn 1 October Ulster played touring South African provincial side Griqualand West. Davy Tweed came in to the second row alongside Jeremy Davidson. Paddy Johns was named at number 8, with Stephen McKinty and Denis McBride on the flanks. With David Humphreys unavailable after moving to Oxford University, Mark McCall was selected at out-half. Jonathan Bell was unavailable with a hamstring injury, so Ireland international Maurice Field joined Bill Harbinson in the centres, and former international fullback Colin Wilkinson was drafted into the team, despite having retired from representative rugby two years previously, on the basis of his club form for Malone. James Topping scored three tries and Wilkinson scored two drop goals in a convincing 54-10 win.\nThey next faced a touring New Zealand Federation under-23 side on 9 November. Although originally scheduled as an Ulster Development match, Ulster decided to field their senior team after their development side was badly beaten by Natal Emerging. Stephen Ritchie came in for his provincial debut at hooker. Gary Longwell returned alongside Jeremy Davidson in the second row, and Bruce Cornelius and Kevin McKee came back into the back row with Stephen McKinty. Michael Rainey started alongside Maurice Field in the centres, with Graham McCluskey and debutant Andy Park on the wings. Park scored the opening try in a scrappy win.\nFor the match against the Combined Services on 14 November, Simon Booth was selected ahead of Richard Mackey at loosehead prop. Tweed and Longwell made up the second row with Conelius, McKee and McKinty making up the back row. Andrew Matchett came in for Neil Doak at scrum-half, Darryl Callaghan made his provincial debut at out-half, with Mark McCall moved to centre alongside Harbinson, and fellow debutant Robin Morrow came in for Wilkinson at fullback. The Services team included former Ulster and Ireland lock Brian McCall, now a major in Britain's UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. Ulster were well beaten, with only a late try by Stephen Ritchie making the scoreline look respectable.\nUlster opened their Interprovincial campaign at home against defending champions Munster on 25 November. Richard Mackey and Allen Clarke were restored to the front row. Jeremy Davidson returned to partner Davy Tweed in the second row after making his Ireland debut against Fiji. McBride and Stuart Duncan were on the flanks, with Paddy Johns at number 8. Mark McCall moved back to out-half, with Maurice Field returning to partner Harbinson in the centres, Jan Cunningham and James Topping back on the wings, and Jonathan Bell returning to the team at fullback. Ulster won 14–10 in an uninspiring encounter, with Richard Mackey scoring the winning try 12 minutes from time. \nSale loose forward David Erskine had been declared ineligible for Ulster by the IRFU, as he was not born in Ireland and was no longer resident there. He won his appeal against the decision, and was selected at number 8 for Ulster's opening Heineken Cup match away to Cardiff on 28 November, in place of Paddy Johns. Gary Longwell replaced Davy Tweed, who was unable to get time off from his job with Northern Ireland Railways, in the second row. Ulster were beaten 46–6. Cardiff, in common with other Welsh sides, had adopted the relatively new tactic of lifting in the lineout; Irish teams had not, and Ulster players were unable to deal with it.\nThe following weekend, they went to Galway to play Connacht in the Interprovincial Championship on 2 December. Paddy Johns returned at number 8, and Davy Tweed was back in the second row alongside Jeremy Davidson. They won 27–9, based on the hard work of Johns, Duncan and McBride in the back row, and Tweed's dominance in the lineout. \nOn 9 December Ulster made nine changes to the side to play Edinburgh District at home. Stephen Ritchie came in for Allen Clarke at hooker, David Scott for Gary Leslie at tighhead prop, and Gary Longwell for Davy Tweed in the second row. The whole back row was rested, with Kevin McKee, Stephen McKinty and David Erskine replacing Denis McBride, Stuart Duncan and Paddy Johns. Andrew Matchett came in for Neil Doak at scrum-half, Andy Park for Jan Cunningham on the wing, and Colin Wilkinson returned at fullback in place of Jonathan Bell. They lost 23-24, with all of Ulster's points being scored by Mark McCall.\nClarke, Leslie, Davidson, Tweed, McBride, Duncan, Johns, Topping and Bell returned, and Matchett and Park retained their places, for Ulster's second and final match in the Heineken Cup, at home to Bègles-Bordeaux on 13 December. The game was close until the final five minutes, when, at 16–22, McBride was stopped short of the try line. Soon after, Bègles-Bordeaux's Sebastien Loubsens intercepted an Ulster pass, leading to a try by Julien Berthe that put the French side too far ahead to catch. The match finished 16–29. Ulster finished bottom of the pool, failing to make the semi-finals. Toulouse went on to become the first European cup winners, beating Cardiff in extra time in front of a crowd of 21,800 at Cardiff Arms Park.\nJan Cunningham returned for the Interpro against the Irish Exiles on 16 December, which Ulster dominated, winning 29–3, and setting up a championship decider against Leinster on 23 December. Leinster won their first Interprovincial title for twelve years with a 31–3 win at Donnybrook. The starting XV was unchanged. Paul Wallace scored the opening try after fifteen seconds, and Leinster raced to a 22–0 lead in the first twenty minutes. Ulster had plenty of possession, with Paddy Johns coming close to scoring on two occasions before half-time, but Leinster defended strongly, and only conceded one Mark McCall penalty.\nAllen Clarke, Davy Tweed, Jeremy Davidson, Denis McBride, Paddy Johns, Jonathan Bell and Maurice Field were selected for Ireland's tour to the USA in January 1996.\nDavid Humphreys, who had now joined London Irish, was recalled for Ulster's home match against New South Wales on 6 February. Bill Harbinson had retired from representative rugby, so Mark McCall moved to centre alongside Maurice Field, Colin Wilkinson returned at fullback, and Davy Tweed came in to the second row in place of the injured Jeremy Davidson. Humphreys led Ulster to a 40-33 victory in front of the Ireland management team.\nDavid Humphreys and Allen Clarke made their Ireland debuts in the 1996 Five Nations Championship. Paddy Johns, Jeremy Davidson, Denis McBride, Jonathan Bell, Maurice Field and Mark McCall also appeared for Ireland in the tournament.\nIRFU Interprovincial Championship.\nTop three provincial teams qualify for next year's Heineken Cup.\nClub rugby.\nUlster Senior League.\nThe Ulster Senior League, known for sponsorship reasons as the Famous Grouse Ulster Championship, was won by Portadown."

        "text": "The 1996–97 Ulster Rugby season was Ulster's second season under professionalism, during which they competed in the IRFU Interprovincial Championship and the Heineken Cup.\nIn June 1996, Ulster hired former Leicester Tigers coach Tony Russ on a five-year contract as their Director of Rugby. He would coach the Ulster senior team, organise strategy, and help develop the game from schools to senior level, working closely with IRFU Director of Rugby Ray Southam.\nAt this stage the Irish provinces were still representative teams, not professional clubs. However, Ulster were now offering contracts and match fees for Heineken Cup and Interprovincial matches, although these contracts sometimes conflicted with players contracted to clubs in England. English clubs were prepared to release their Irish players for the Heineken Cup, but not for the Interprovincial Championship, but clubs in England and Wales were unhappy at having to compete against representative teams from Ireland in the Heineken Cup. Out-half David Humphreys and lock Jeremy Davidson defied their club, London Irish, by competing in the Heineken Cup for Ulster, but were unavailable for Ulster's match against Australia as it clashed with London Irish's league match against Wasps. In Humphreys' absence, Ulster called on former Scotland \"A\" international Stuart Laing.\nUlster finished third in the Interprovincial Championship, and fourth in their pool in the Heineken Cup. In November, Russ quit to join English second division club Waterloo F.C., unhappy that after eight games, he would not be able to work with his Ulster players again for six months. Clive Griffiths was lined up to take over, but withdrew for family reasons. Davy Haslett, a geography teacher at Royal Belfast Academical Institution and assistant coach on the 1997 Ireland A rugby union tour of Oceania, was named as coach for the 1997–98 season in June.\nUlster players selected for Ireland for the 1997 Five Nations Championship were: Jonny Bell, Allen Clarke, Jeremy Davidson, Maurice Field, David Humphreys, Paddy Johns, Denis McBride and James Topping. Jeremy Davidson was selected for the 1997 British Lions tour to South Africa.\n1996–97 IRFU Interprovincial Championship.\nTop three teams qualify for next season's Heineken Cup."

        "title": "Up with People at the Super Bowl",
        "text": "The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). The organization Up with People performed in five Super Bowl halftime shows (headlining four of them), and additionally performed in one Super Bowl pre-game show. In addition, in one of the years that they performed as the halftime headliners, Up with People accompanied Tom Sullivan in performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" (the national anthem of the United States) before the game. Up with People has performed in more Super Bowl halftime shows and had more overall Super Bowl performances than any other act.\nUp with People's halftime appearances took place during an era in which Super Bowl halftime shows differed from the large-name performer-headlined performances of more recent Super Bowls. Prior to the 1993 Super Bowl XXVII halftime show, Super Bowl halftime shows were more in line with college football halftime shows, often featuring performances by marching bands and local performers. Among the shows of this era were also performances produced by such groups as The Walt Disney Company, Air Force Entertainment (Tops In Blue), and Radio City Productions. Shows occasionally featured notable entertainers, but were not centered upon these names in the vein of modern halftime shows.\nRetrospective looks by entertainment critics have given an overwhelmingly negative reception to the Super Bowl performances of Up with People.\nSuper Bowl V halftime show (1971).\nUp with People were included as performers in the Super Bowl V halftime show, which was headlined by the Southeast Missouri State Marching Band with Anita Bryant as a guest.\nSuper Bowl X performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" (1976).\nAt Super Bowl X, Up with People accompanied Tom Sullivan in performing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" (the national anthem of the United States) before the start of the game. Up with People also headlined the halftime show for Super Bowl X.\nSuper Bowl X halftime show (1976).\nThe Super Bowl X halftime show was performed by Up with People, marking the first Super Bowl halftime show not to have a marching band as its headlining act. Taking place the year of the United States Bicentennial, the performance's theme was \"200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America's Bicentennial\". Up with People had also joined Tom Sullivan in performing the national anthem before the start of the game.\nRetrospective critical reception.\nIn a 2012 article for \"Entertainment Weekly\", Chris Nashawaty named the show as one of the worst Super Bowl halftime shows up through the 2011 halftime show. Nashawaty characterized the show, characterizing it as consisting of, \"squeaky-clean, milk-drinking musical numbers\". Nashawaty criticized Up with People in general, calling them a, \"Benetton-ad collection of students from all over the world gathered together to make the cast of Fame look like hardened criminals.\" and further opining, \"if you're too young to remember Up With People, let's put it this way — they are the music that gets played in hell’s waiting room.\" In a 2010 article for \"Bleacher Report\", Tim McGhee criticized the performance, quipping, \"it was as if your church's choir had taken off the robes to reveal Republican fashions and Mister Rogers was the choreographer.\"\nSuper Bowl XIV halftime show (1980).\nThe \"Super Bowl XIV halftime show\" was performed by Up with People and the Grambling State University Marching Bands. Its theme was \"A Salute to the Big Band Era\".\nContemporary critical reception.\nHarry Missildine of \"The Spokesman-Review\" called that show \"outstanding\", and opined that it was largely more \"exciting\" than the play during the first half of the game. Lane Crockett, the entertainment editor for Shreveport's \"Time Times\" wrote positively of the \"effortlessness\" of the performance.\nSuper Bowl XVI halftime show (1982).\nThe Super Bowl XVI halftime show was the third of four halftime shows which Up with People headlined. Its theme was \"A Salute to the 1960s and Motown\". The show featured songs of the Motown genre, as well as songs from the 1960s in general. That year's Super Bowl took place in Pontiac, Michigan, near the city of Detroit, where the genre Motown traced its roots. The show lasted thirteen minutes.\nLogistics.\nUp with People's cast featured more than 430 individuals from 24 nations. The performers spent more than three weeks in the Detroit area in advance of the game, with some rehearsal taking place at an indoor facility located at the University of Michigan. The show featured a modular set erected on the playing field.\nCritical reception.\nContemporary reception.\nJoe Lapointe of the \"Detroit Free Press\" called the show, \"ironic and sort of sad\". Roger Fischer of the \"Tampa Bay Times\" likened the show to, \"a Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters prime time affair\", and opined that the broadcast time allotted to showing the performance would have been better used to provide further game analysis. Geoff Hobson of the \"Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin\" wrote negatively of the show. He criticized the decision to have Up with People perform, instead of the marching band of the University of Michigan (located relatively near the site of that year's Super Bowl). He opined that the show, \"should have been shot for impersonating a Norman Rockwell painting. Painted smiles on painted faces perched on platinum peaks. Singing cliches in outfits that looked older than the songs they sang from the 1960s.\"\nRetrospective reception.\nIn a 2010 retrospective look at Super Bowl halftime shows, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" ranked the Super XVI halftime show as the worst in history, up through 2010. While critical of all of Up with People's appearances, the piece considered their 1982 halftime appearance to be their worst, writing, \"The group's ‘Salute to Motown and the 1960s’ was the worst of its four Super Bowl appearances. The performances featured the whitest people in the world performing music mostly identified with African-American culture. Imagine watching the cast of ‘Bonanza’ performing in a Tyler Perry play\". In response to this piece, in 2013, Doug Williams of ESPN noted, \"to be fair, Up With People had several African-American performers that year\". In a 2013 article, \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked the show as the seventh-worst halftime show (up through 2012), writing that the show, \"featured the band's super smiley/creepy attitude\".\nContrarily, a 2012 \"The Washington Times\" article gave the performance a positive retrospective look, ranking it the ninth-best Super Bowl halftime show up through 2012, considering it to be enjoyably wholesome in comparison to more modern Super Bowl halftime shows, writing that Up with People, \"were as inoffensive as puppies eating ice cream and apple pie\". Additionally, a 2017 \"mlive\" article by Edward Pevos considered the show to have been \"fun\".\nSuper Bowl XX halftime show (1986).\nThe Super Bowl XX halftime show was the fourth (and final) Super Bowl halftime show headlined by Up with People, and the fifth overall Super Bowl halftime show in which they performed. The theme of the show was \"Beat of the Future\". The show itself was given the title \"Room for Everyone\".\nLogistics.\nThe show was directed by John Gonzalez. Up with People's music director for the show was Annette Wilkins. Up with People's cast for the show featured between 500 and members.\nThe 10-ton, stage utilized for the performance was transported to the venue from an airport near New Orleans Airport at midnight several days before the game, with some streets being closed and a police escort accompanying the convoy of seven trucks carrying the oversize load of the stage. A three minute commercial break before the performance was allotted for the set-up of the stage.\nFor the performance, a gondola carrying of lighting equipment was lowered from the stadium's rafters. Five tons of theatrical lighting was used in the performance. The NFL refused to allow Up with People to turn off the venue's stadium lighting, fearing that there would be a risk that the lightning might fail to turn back on after the performance. To deal with this, blackout screens were placed to help darken the venue. \nSpace-focused artist Robert McCall (who worked with NASA) designed the sets for the show. Some of the individuals that had organized the 1984 Summer Olympics closing ceremony helped to come up ideas for incorporating crowd participation into the show.\nThe show was scheduled to last 12 minutes. \nThere were reports that Up with People was given US$30 million in return for organizing the halftime show.\nSynopsis.\nThe halftime performance was dedicated in memory of Martin Luther King Jr. It featured a taped segment with Bill Cosby and Lily Tomlin encouraging Americans to participate in the upcoming Hands Across America demonstration.\nIn the performance, dancers acted out various scenes portraying the future. The setlist was a mix of slower-paced songs and up-beat tunes. The show's setlist featured contemporary 1980s songs.\nCritical reception.\nContemporary reception.\nIn an article negative towards the performance, Dick Shippy of the \"Akron Beacon Journal\" called the show, \"one of the dumbest halftime shows ever conceived\". Shippy called the show \"ludicrous\". He criticized the inclusion of the appeal for participation in Hands Across America (a demonstration against hunger in the United States), writing, \"there could be no more inappropriate place for such an appeal than a Super Bowl game. Anything connected with Super Bowl and Super Bowl Week screams of conspicuous consumption.\" Shippy went on to criticize the dedication of the performance to Martin Luther King Jr., writing, \"only a little bit behind in the bitter irony category was the Up with People halftime tribute to Dr. Martin Liuther King Jr. Do you have a feeling that a pitch for brotherhood, made at a Roman circus, is something less than heartfelt?\"\nAhead of the game, Alan Greenberg of the \"Hartford Courant\" was critical of the decision to again have Up with People perform the halftime show, opining that Up with People, \"is a horribly bad, boring, group that always succeeds in making even the worst NFL game seem interesting by comparison\". Also ahead of the game, Bill Modoono of \"The Pittsburgh Press\" noted that the \"perpetual cheeriness\" of Up with People makes some viewers, \"nauseous\".\nRetrospective reception.\nIn a 2013 \"Bleacher Report\" article, Matt King ranked the Super Bowl XX halftime show as the fifth-worst halftime show up to the previous year. A 2017 \"mlive\" article by Edward Pevos considered the mix of slower songs and upbeat tunes to be \"bizarre\", and opined that, despite its theme, the show failed to look futuristic. Pevos further opined that the show, \"didn't match the fun\" of Up with People's preceding performance at Super Bowl XVI. In a 2020 \"Lineups\" article, Tyler Worthington ranked this the sixth-worst halftime show up through 2020, writing, \"Up With People is a music group that didn't do anything excited and just had us hoping that the game would get started again. This was their last performance and by the reception of these performances, I think that is for the better.\" In a 2013 article, \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked the show as the sixth-worst halftime show (up through 2012). Commenting on it being their last halftime performance, the magazine opined that their departure from the Super Bowl halftime scene came, \"not a moment too soon.\"\nSuper Bowl XXV pre-game show (1991).\nUp with People performed the Super Bowl XXV pre-game show. This was their last appearance as Super Bowl performers.\nOverall retrospective critical reception of halftime performances.\nRetrospective looks at the Super Bowl halftime shows Up with People performed have been negative. A 2010 \"San Francisco Chronicle\" article opined, \"I hope you were throwing the football in your front yard during halftime shows in the 1970s and early 1980s, which all seemed to feature Up With People or Carol Channing. Up With People always had a creepy-weird cultish quality, with exaggerated dance moves, brightly colored yet chaste clothing and industrial-grade happiness.\" In a 2013 \"Bleacher Report\" article, writer Matt King criticized the perennial inclusion of Up with People at the Super Bowl, calling them, \"a bland group that sang bland music in a bland fashion\". In an 2022 \"Adweek\" article, Robert Klara negatively looked back at Up with People as halftime performers, describing them as a \"treacly (and overwhelmingly white) dance troupe\".\nIn a 2021 \"Yardbarker\" article, Daniel Tran collectively ranked Up with People's four headlining Super Bowl halftime appearances as the worst halftime shows up through 2020, writing that the shows featured, \"grown adults singing and dancing with cult-like enthusiasm and soulless eyes,\" and opining that the four shows, \"will forever be the worst and probably most terrifying series of Super Bowl halftime performances ever.\" In a 2022 \"Athlon Sports\" article, Aaroon Allen collectively ranked Up with People's four headlining halftime appearances the 15th-worst of Super Bowl halftime shows out of 48 entries. In a 2022 Live365 article, Kathryn Milewski collectively ranked every Super Bowl halftime performance by Up with People as the fifth-worst Super Bowl halftime shows, opining, \nIn a 2016 \"Houston Chronicle\" piece, characterizing Up With People's shows as belonging to a more \"innocent era\" of Super Bowl entertainment, Ken Hoffman described Up With People as, \"the squeaky clean, optimistic and, sure, corny and slap-happy group of fresh-faced entertainers whose most sinister wardrobe malfunction was maybe a tilted American flag lapel pin.\"\nIn pop culture.\nIn a parody of Up With People's halftime appearances on the long-running cartoon series \"The Simpsons\", the fictional group \"Hooray for Everything\" (the show's recurring parody of Up With People) performed a football game halftime show with the theme \"A Salute to the Western Hemisphere: The Dancin’-est Hemisphere of All!\" in the season two episode \"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\"."

It was the third iteration of the NWSL Challenge Cup tournament.\nFormat.\nThe 2022 NWSL Challenge Cup was a multi-stage tournament. All 12 NWSL teams participated in the Challenge Cup, an increase of two from the previous edition due to the addition of expansion franchises Angel City FC and San Diego Wave FC during the offseason. As a result, the competition was split into three regional groups of four teams each; East, Central and West. Each team played a six-game double round-robin in which every team played all others in its division at home and away. The winner from each of the three divisions along with the highest-ranked group stage runner-up progressed to the knockout stage, which consisted of three single-elimination matches: two semifinals and one final. As a result of the expanded group stage, teams played a minimum of six games, two more than in 2021, and a maximum of eight, three more than in 2021. A total of 39 matches were played, 18 more than the 21 matches played during the 2021 NWSL Challenge Cup. \nNo matches had extra time. In the group stage, matches could end in a tie at the end of normal playing time. In the knockout stage, if a match was tied at the end of normal playing time, the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out.\nTeams were required to have a minimum of 18 players and a maximum of 20 players on a matchday roster. A maximum of nine players could be named as substitutes with a maximum of five substitutions in three stoppages (excluding half-time) permitted to be used during a match. No substitutes could be made after the end of normal playing time (except if a goalkeeper was unable to continue before or during the penalty shoot-out). Two \"concussion substitutes\" could also be used in accordance with IFAB rules.\nTiebreakers.\nA team's position in the divisional standings was determined by points, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a tie, and zero points for a loss. If two or more teams in the same group were tied on points at the end of the group stage, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied to determine the final group standings:\nIn the case of two or more teams from different divisions being tied on points at the end of the group stage, the same procedure was followed except for the use of the head-to-head scenarios by virtue of the fact teams from different divisions would not have played each other during the group stage.\nGroup stage.\nEast Division.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCentral Division.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Division.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nThe best second-placed team from the group stage advanced to the knockout stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nThe seeding of the division winners was determined by points accumulated in the group stage, followed if necessary by any applicable tiebreakers.

The Nanooks represented the University of Alaska Fairbanks and were coached by Lance West, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAfter the resignation of Dallas Ferguson, long-time assistant coach Lance West was promoted to interim head coach while the school decided who would lead the program.\nThe team got off to a bit of a slow start, going winless in its first four games. A sweep of arch-rival Alaska Anchorage got the team on the winning side of the ledger entering conference play, however, the Nanooks weren't able to get many wins afterwards. After notching one victory in their next seven matches, the team started showing some jam when they took down #20 Northern Michigan, 4–1. After a second sweep of the Seawolves, Alaska looked to be well positioned when they split with #8 Minnesota State in mid-January, however, goaltending became a problem afterwards. Neither regular starter Anton Martinsson nor backup Niko Della Maggiore were able to keep the keep the puck out of the net on several occasions. Unfortunately, even when they were, the offense usually failed to do much. Alaska went 2–9–1 in their last 11 games and, other than their sweep of Ferris State, Alaska wasn't able to muster much in the way of scoring. To make matters worse, they faced Alaska Anchorage in the regular season finale and were swept at home. The two wins for the Seawolves were half of their total for the year and seemed to take the fight out of the Nanooks.\nAlaska just held onto the 8th and final spot for the WCHA Tournament and the team's reward was to face Minnesota State, who had now risen to #3 in the polls. Alaska was trounced in the two games, getting outshot 45–78 and outscored 4–14. After the team's melt-down in the later part of the season, Alaska decided not to retain Lance West and instead turned the team over to his assistant, Erik Largen.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

It was the first ever rookie draft since domestic basketball transitioned into the professional era and the Korean Basketball League was established in 1997.\nDraft selections.\n\"This table only shows the first twenty picks.\"\nPlayers.\nFor a league known for producing top-notch guards, the first four overall picks were forwards, with Shin Ki-sung before the highest-ranked guard at 7th. Shin, now a SPOTV commentator, would go on to forge a successful career spanning fourteen years. Other than Hyun, the other players picked before him failed to establish themselves and had brief playing careers, leading to Shin being described as the \"biggest steal\" of the draft.\nPyo Myung-il, also a guard and the 8th overall pick, went on to win the Sixth Man Award and Skill Development Award. He died on January 12, 2022, days before the KBL All-Star Game was scheduled to take place and was honored with a minute's silence prior to the game."

        "text": "The 2017–18 Air Force Falcons men's ice hockey season was the 50th season of play for the program and the 12th season in the Atlantic Hockey conference. The Falcons represented the United States Air Force Academy and were coached by Frank Serratore, in his 21st season.\nSeason.\nAfter a program-best season, Air Force entered the season with a preseason ranking, a rarity for an Atlantic Hockey school. Early on it appeared that the Falcons were going to live up to the expectations when new starting goaltender, Billy Christopoulos, filled in ably for the departed Shane Starett. However, after beginning 5–1–1, the team's offense faltered and the Falcons went through a rough patch in November and December. The defense kept Air Force in most of their games, but the Falcons were finding it difficult to score. By the end of the year, the team found itself under .500 and wallowing near the bottom of the conference standings.\nChristopoulos raised his game in the second half of the season, keeping the opposition to 2 goals or fewer on most nights. The offense, too, redoubled its efforts and the Falcons began to score once more. Slowly, the team climbed out of the cellar and moved up the standings. By the end of February, Air Force had miraculously pulled into a 3-way tie for 3rd place in the conference and entered the Atlantic Hockey Tournament with a bye into the quarterfinal round.\nConference tournament.\nAs their postseason began, Air Force's only chance at making the NCAA Tournament was to win their conference. To do that, they would first have to overcome Army on the road. After winning the first game 5–3, the Falcons got into a defensive struggle with the Black Knights. Despite firing 33 shots on goal, Army netminder Cole Bruns turned everything aside and tied the series with a 1–0 victory. The Falcons increased the pressure in the deciding 3rd game, but again Bruns wouldn't let anything get past him. Fortunately, Christopoulos was equal to the task and the teams entered overtime with a clean scoresheet. Air Force continued the barrage, firing five shots on goal in less than 7 minutes with the last finally registering. Senior alternate captain Tyler Ledford won the game and sent the Falcons to the semifinals.\nAfter arriving in Rochester, the Air Force offense kept up its shot total while Christopoulos remained stout in goal. The Falcons dispatched Canisius to reach their second consecutive title game and found a surprise waiting for them; the 7th-seed, Robert Morris had overcome long odds to reach the final and were riding high after taking down top-seeded Mercyhurst. Air Force put the Colonials in their place at the start, scoring twice in the first three minutes and ending the first period up 3–0. Robert Morris made a valiant effort to try and come back in the final 40 minutes, but Christopoulos was far too strong in net and the Falcons won the match by a comfortable 5–1 margin, earning the program's 7th Atlantic Hockey championship and a trip back to the NCAA tournament.\nNCAA tournament.\nThough the team had been good over the preceding two and a half months, it was no surprise when Air Force was given the lowest seed for the tournament. That entitled the Falcons to a date with #1 St. Cloud State. The game started slowly but the Air Force needed to kill of two penalties in the later half of the first period to keep the Huskies from getting a lead. Early in the second, Ledford scored twice in the span of just over 3:30 to give the Falcons a surprising 2–0 lead. Afterwards, St. Cloud woke up and began attacking the Air Force goal. Christopoulos turned aside 18 shots in the middle frame to keep the Huskies from scoring. The upperclassmen continued to stymie St. Cloud State in the third but finally allowed the puck to get past him with just under 3 minutes left in regulation. The Huskies pulled their goalie in a desperate attempt to tie the game, but Air Force managed to collect two empty-net goals to win the match 4–1.\nOne win away from its first Frozen Four, the team was completely outplayed in the first period against Minnesota–Duluth. Air Force was outshot 0–14 and allowed two goals. The Bulldogs pulled back and played a defensive game in the final 40 minutes but that gave the Falcons a chance to tie the match. Though they only managed 12 shots in that time, Evan Giesler scored a power play goal in the middle part of the third period to cut the lead in half and the Falcons desperately tried to score the tying goal. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be and the Falcons were knocked out in the quarterfinal round.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

Unfortunately, the team got off to a poor start and began the season 1–4. The Falcons recovered afterwards and righted the ship with a 5-game winning streak, placing them near the top of the conference standings. A sweep at the hands of American International in mid-November put them behind the 8-ball at least in terms of a league championship, but a good showing against Bemidji State and in the Ice Vegas Invitational gave the team hope for another NCAA appearance.\nThe second half of their season began similar to the first half and Air Force went through a stretch of 5 game without a win. They briefly bounced back against Robert Morris but then hovered around .500 for the remainder of the season. Entering the postseason, Air Force had no mathematic chance to make the 2019 NCAA Tournament without winning their conference tournament. That glimmer of hope was quickly snuffed out when they were upset by Niagara in the quarterfinals.\nAfter the season, Billy Christopoulos joined the select few graduates of the Air Force Academy to play professional hockey when he signed with the South Carolina Stingrays.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "National Baseball Commission",
        "text": "The National Baseball Commission was the governing body of Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball from 1903 to 1920. It consisted of a chairman, the presidents of the National League (NL) and American League (AL), and a secretary. The commission was formed as part of the peace agreement between the AL and NL and abolished following the Black Sox Scandal. It was replaced with the Commissioner of Baseball.\nBackground and formation.\nPrior to the 1900 season, the Western League, which had been a minor league located in the Midwestern United States, changed its name to the American League (AL) and moved several of its franchises to larger, strategic locations, including cities abandoned by the National League (NL). In 1901, the American League declared its intent to operate as a major league, challenging the National League.\nA peace agreement between the NL and AL was ratified in January 1903. The National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the organization of minor baseball leagues, did not agree to the terms of the arrangement. In August 1903, the NL, AL, and minor leagues reached an agreement which established the National Baseball Commission as the governing body for Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball, commonly referred to as \"Organized Baseball\". August Herrmann, the owner of the Cincinnati Reds of the NL, served as chairman of the commission, while the presidents of the AL, Ban Johnson, and NL, Harry Pulliam, also had seats on the commission. John E. Bruce, Johnson's personal attorney, was elected secretary and treasurer of the National Commission.\nChallenges.\nThe National Commission dealt with conflicts between teams and leagues. One of the most significant conflicts came in when the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Browns both had claims for George Sisler. Sisler had signed a minor league contract before deciding to attend the University of Michigan, and the Pirates had acquired the contractual rights while Sisler had successful college baseball career. Sisler signed a contract with the Browns after leaving college. In 1912, the commission declared the original contract void because Sisler was a minor without parental permission at the time it was signed, and awarded his rights to the Browns. Barney Dreyfuss, the owner of the Pirates, never forgave Herrmann for the decision and began to work to have him ousted as chairman.\nAfter the 1912 season, Dave Fultz, an attorney and former major league player, attempted to unionize major league players in an organization called the Players Fraternity. He became president, with Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson, Ed Sweeney, and Red Dooin serving as vice presidents. The group achieved concessions for the players from the National Commission before the 1914 season.\nThe Federal League declared itself to be a major league in 1914, challenging Organized Baseball. In January 1915, the league filed suit against the National Commission, accusing it and the National Agreement of violating federal antitrust law. The case was assigned to Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Landis opted not to rule on the case, and the Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season. When the two sides returned to his court in February 1916 to have the suit dismissed, Landis said that he waited to see if they could forge a settlement, because he had feared that issuing an injunction would have been harmful to baseball.\nIn July 1919, Carl Mays left the Boston Red Sox without permission. Johnson demanded that the Red Sox suspend him, but instead, the Red Sox traded Mays to the New York Yankees. Johnson suspended Mays for deserting the Red Sox. Yankees owner Tillinghast Huston accused Johnson of having a financial interest in the Cleveland Indians, Huston and co-owner Jacob Ruppert obtained a temporary injunction allowing Mays to play. New York Supreme Court Justice Robert F. Wagner ruled in favor of the Yankees, granting a permanent injunction. The owners of the Yankees, Red Sox, and Chicago White Sox began to collectively oppose Johnson, becoming known as the \"Insurrectos\". Though the Insurrectos were outnumbered by the five teams loyal to Johnson, they held three out of the four seats on the league's board of directors.\nCollapse.\nAfter the 1918 season, Harry Frazee, the owner of the Red Sox, and Harry Hempstead, the owner of the New York Giants, approached William Howard Taft, the former president of the United States, with an offer to make him baseball's sole commissioner. With other NL owners looking to replace Herrmann as chair of the commission, the new owners of the Giants switched course, supporting Herrmann's reelection to the chairmanship for the 1919 season as revenge for various rules passed by the league that hurt the Giants.\nIn January 1920, Herrmann resigned from the commission. Johnson and John Heydler, the NL president, were unable to agree on a new chairman.\nIn September 1920, a grand jury was called in Cook County, Illinois, to address an allegation of match fixing of a game between the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies. After investigating corruption in baseball, the grand jury indicted eight members of the White Sox for conspiring to throw the 1919 World Series, known as the Black Sox Scandal. By October 1920, Heydler called for the end of the commission. Albert Lasker proposed the idea of having three individuals with no financial ties to baseball serving on the commission.\nAll eight teams in the National League, along with the Insurrectos in the American League, threatened to break away from Organized Baseball to form their own 12-team league. They turned to Landis as their preferred choice for commissioner. Landis agreed to serve as Commissioner of Baseball, if he could have sole authority and not share the role with other commissioners. The owners agreed and Landis accepted the position on November 12, 1920, ending the commission."

In 1930 the club also changed their colours to their current \"Two Blue strip\" and became known as the Seagulls or just \"Gulls\".\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe club was originally formed in 1893 and donned a black jersey with the insignia of a skull and crossbones over the left breast. Until 1928, when the West Australian Rugby Union was formed, the club didn't play on a competition basis. When the club joined the WARU in 1928 they changed their name to the seagulls and retained the black and white jerseys for 2 years until adopting their current club colours that of the \"Two Blue strips\". When WW2 broke out most of the clubs disbanded (like a lot of clubs) and Cott combined with Perth (now Perth Bayswater) for a few years in a small competition. The club was reformed in 1948 by pre-war members.\nPost War Years.\nThe 1950s were very successful for Cottesloe, achieving a minor Premiership in 1954 and major premiers in 1955 and 1956. The mid 60's was dire times fore Cottesloe, becoming a victim of the restructuring of the competition, players dwindled, debts were high and the death of the club looked near. The club borrowed money from the union, bought a set of jumpers and an SOS was sent out for players. Although the club finished last in the 1962 season, for the first time in their history, their debts had gone and the club was no longer in financial trouble. The club had an emphasis on schoolboy rugby, with many of the states best schoolboy players playing exclusively for Cottesloe. Up until 1963 the club trained on The Esplanade, sharing a small change room with Western Suburbs (Now Wests Scarborough). In 1964 training on Thursday nights was moved to Cottesloe and training on Tuesday nights continued at The Esplanade. In 1965, lights were installed at Cottesloe Oval and so the club moved there for training on both nights and for games. From 1971 to 1974, renovations at an old house on Broome Street, overlooking the pitch, became the clubs current clubhouse. The 1980s were a very successful time for the club, Premiers from 1984 to 1985 and again in 1988. The nineties saw another Premiership in 1992 and the formation of the Cottesloe Women's team (The Shegulls) in 1996 with them, themselves winning their first Premiership in 1999."

        "text": "Cases of COVID-19 at the 2022 Winter Olympics and the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing, China, is a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China that began in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Village in January 2022, prior to the Opening Ceremony of the games on 4 February 2022.\nThere were 437 total coronavirus cases detected and reported by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games since 23 January 2022. All cases at the 2022 Olympics are counted towards China's COVID case count rather than the home country of the person.\nThere were 26 cases in the time period after the 2022 Winter Olympics, which includes the 2022 Winter Paralympics. In total, more than 2.5 million tests for COVID-19 were conducted.\nBackground.\nOn 31 July 2015, Beijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics, officially the XXIV Olympic Winter Games, during the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was elected over Almaty. The games were the second Olympic Games to be held in China following Beijing 2008 (Summer). As a result, Beijing will also be the first city to host both the Summer and the Winter Games for the Olympics and Paralympics.\nOn 1 December 2019, the first known case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel virus caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in Wuhan. The virus has since spread to other parts of the host country and around the world, becoming the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the deadliest pandemics in history.\nDuring the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, there were 464 COVID-19 cases linked to the games. Despite the strict COVID-19 containment efforts including bubbles and claims of being the safest sporting event, the Beijing Winter Olympics reported only 27 fewer cases than the similar scale event during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, which had less stringent COVID-19 containment measures.\nTimeline of positive cases.\nThe first case related to the 2022 Winter Olympics was reported on Sunday 23 January 2022. Out of the total 437 cases of COVID-19 linked to the 2022 Winter Olympics, 171 cases, including 68 athletes or team officials were among the COVID-19 protective bubble residents. The rest of the 266 cases were detected from airport testing of the games related arrivals."

        "text": "The 2022 Atlantic Coast Conference baseball tournament was held from May 24 through 29 at Truist Field in Charlotte, North Carolina. The annual tournament determined the conference champion of the Division I Atlantic Coast Conference for college baseball. The tournament champion, the North Carolina Tar Heels, received the league's automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I baseball tournament.\nThe tournament has been held every year but two since 1973, with Clemson winning ten championships, the most all-time. Georgia Tech has won nine championships, and Florida State has won eight titles since their entry to the league in 1992. Recent entrants Virginia Tech, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Louisville have never won the event.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe winner of each seven team division and the top ten other teams based on conference winning percentage, regardless of division, from the conference's regular season were seeded one through twelve. Seeds one and two were awarded to the two division winners. Teams were then divided into four pools of three teams each, with the winners advancing to single elimination bracket for the championship.\nIf a 1–1 tie were to occur among all three teams in a pool, the highest seeded team would have advanced to the semifinals. Because of this, seeds 5–12 must win both pool play games to advance to the single-elimination bracket, and seeds 1–4 must only win the game against the winner of the game between the other two teams in the pool to advance. For example, if the 12 seed beats the 8 seed in the first game, then the winner of the 12 seed versus 1 seed advances, and the 8 seed versus 1 seed game has no effect on which team advances.\nThe seeds were announced on May 21, after the final day of conference play.\nSchedule and Results.\nSchedule.\nSource:\nAll–Tournament Team.\nSource:"

A native of Lido Beach, New York, Taylor chose to play for the Hofstra Pride after his standout prep career at Long Beach High School in which he averaged 30.5 points and 19 rebounds per game as a senior. At Hofstra, he was named the 1983 East Coast Conference Player of the Year.\nCollege career.\nTaylor had originally committed to play for Pensacola Junior College in Florida. In the summer of 1978, after his high school graduation, he spent 10 days in Pensacola and took four classes, but then decided he did not want to stay. The NCAA classified that move as a transfer, so Taylor was forced to redshirt (sit out) his true freshman season of 1978–79. When he became eligible the following year, Taylor led the team in scoring at 17.6 points per game and was named the East Coast Conference co-Rookie of the Year. During Taylor's four-year college career, he scored 1,818 points and grabbed 926 rebounds, which were fourth and third all-time in school history, respectively, at the time of his graduation. He was twice named First Team All-ECC as a junior and senior, and in 1982–83 was honored as the ECC Player of the Year.\nProfessional career and later life.\nTaylor was not selected in the 1983 NBA draft. He instead played one year of professional basketball in France for ASVEL. That year, ASVEL won the Federation Cup. Taylor then returned to the United States, where he has been active as a middle school and high school basketball coach, an AAU coach, personal trainer, and mentor."

        "text": "The Westend tennis hall was a tennis centre located in the Westend district of Espoo, Finland. The tennis hall was designed by architect Jarl Eklund and completed in 1935. It was commissioned by Arne Grahn, Olympic tennis player and owner of the Hagalund manor.\nHistory.\nThe Westend tennis hall had two indoor tennis courts and eight mass-covered outdoor courts. The hall also included office spaces, accommodation and club spaces as well as a restaurant. The Swedish-speaking tennis club Westend Tennis Stadion Klubb was founded in connection with the tennis hall in 1937.\nThe original tennis activity in the hall proved to be short-lived. In 1949 Grahn sold the hall to the Finnish Central Association for Agriculture and Forestry Producers, which used the hall as a training facility. In 1952 it served as one of the venues of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, hosting the fencing competitions. After the Olympics, the hall returned to its original purpose until the middle 1960s. It served its last years as a school, until it was destroyed in a fire in January 1967. The site of the building now belongs to the district of Tapiola, and the head office of the LähiTapiola insurance company has been built in the hall's place. The adjacent street was long known as Tennispolku, until it was renamed Revontulentie in 1975.\nDismissal of Jewish members.\nIn May 1939 the Swedish-speaking tennis club Westend Tennis Stadion Klubb based in the Westend tennis hall dismissed six Jewish members. According to club chairman Arne Grahn, the reason for the dismissal was failure to pay membership fees. The real reason was suspected to be antisemitism, as there had been over 120 members who had failed to pay their membership fees, but only the Jewish members were dismissed. The event was published in several Finnish newspapers and also attracted attention in Sweden.\nAmong the dismissed members were Jack S. Kotschack and Boris Grünstein, owner of the Grünstein fur shop. In his 1989 memoir \"Juutalaisena Suomessa\" (\"As a Jew in Finland\") he mentioned that Grahn had later apologised for his dismissal. Grahn has said that the reason was pressure from abroad, as the tennis club had close ties to German coaches in the 1930s. The matter came into publicity again in 1945, when a Swedish tennis club had planned to come as a visitor for the Westend Tennis Stadion Klubb. After the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" had written about the 1939 event, the club ended up cancelling their visit."
