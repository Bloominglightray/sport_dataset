        "text": "Mark O'Neill (born 19 June 1975) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s. He played in Australia for the Balmain Tigers, then the Wests Tigers following the joint venture of Balmain and the Western Suburbs Magpies, and in England for the Leeds Rhinos and the Hull Kingston Rovers in the Super League. O'Neill usually played as a . O'Neill currently holds the NSWRL/NRL record for the most first grade games played before competing in a finals match which stands at 219 games.\nBiography.\nO'Neill was born in Paddington, New South Wales, Australia on 19 June 1985.\nPlaying career.\nA staunch and durable player, O'Neill was a member of the Tigers, in both their forms, for 13 seasons. He was a local Balmain junior who played at the Dundas Shamrocks and North Ryde Hawks clubs. O'Neill made his first grade debut for Balmain in round 19 of the 1994 NSWRL season against St. George at Leichhardt Oval. O'Neill played in Balmain's final ever match as a stand-alone entity which came against Canberra in round 26 of the 1999 NRL season. The match finished 42–14. O'Neill was one of the players from the Balmain club who was offered a contract to play for the newly formed Wests Tigers side. O'Neill played in Wests Tigers inaugural match in round 1 of the 2000 NRL season against Brisbane at Campbelltown Stadium which finished in a 24–24 draw.\nO'Neill played his 200th NRL match against the Sydney Roosters at Campbelltown Stadium in Round 16, 2004, but the milestone match would not be remembered for the right reasons as the Tigers lost by 56–0.\nThree weeks later, he was on the receiving end of a serious case of foul-play in 2004 when Danny Williams of the Melbourne Storm punched O'Neill in the face in an off the ball incident. Williams received an 18-match ban.\nIn 2005 he was voted team captain, a title Scott Prince took over during O'Neill's twelve weeks absence with an elbow injury. Controversially, coach Tim Sheens retained Prince as captain on O'Neill's return to the team. He went on to play at second-row forward in the Tigers 2005 NRL Grand Final win over the North Queensland Cowboys.\nAt the end of the 2005 season, O'Neill moved to England and Leeds Rhinos. His season at Leeds was marred by injury. A pre-season friendly resulted in a shoulder injury which sidelined him for four months and a leg muscle tear resulted in six weeks off the field. O'Neill's contract at Leeds was not renewed and he spent 2007 at Hull Kingston Rovers where he played his final year in professional rugby league before retiring.\nPost-playing career.\nIn February 2008, O'Neill was appointed to the NRL's Match Review Committee. The committee scans match videos for incidents of foul play.\nIn 2016, O'Neill worked at his former club the Wests Tigers as football manager but later resigned after alleged misconduct.\nHe also worked for Sky News as a rugby league analyst.\nIn October 2018, O'Neill was appointed as general manager of football at the Parramatta Eels."

        "title": "Major League Baseball drug policy",
        "text": "Major League Baseball's drug policy—the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program—was established by agreement between the MLB Players Association and the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball. The goal was to deter and end the use of banned substances, including anabolic steroids and other illegal drugs, and to \"provide for, in keeping with the overall purposes of the Program, an orderly, systematic, and cooperative resolution of any disputes that may arise concerning the existence, interpretation, or application\" of the policy itself. The Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program was adopted in the Spring of 2006.\nWhile the Health Policy Advisory Committee (HPAC) can make recommendations to the Office of the Commissioner regarding punishment, it has no power to discipline players for violations of the drug policy, except to place them in the appropriate treatment programs. Such authority belongs to the Office of the Commissioner.\nProhibited substances.\nUnder the policy, all players are prohibited from using, possessing, selling, facilitating the sale of, distributing, or facilitating the distribution of any Drug of Abuse, human growth hormone (HGH) and Steroid. Any and all drugs or substances listed under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act are considered drugs of abuse covered by the Program. Players who require prescription medication can still use it with a \"Therapeutic Use Exemption\" granted by MLB.\nProhibited Substances may be added to the list only by the unanimous vote of HPAC, provided that the addition by the federal government of a substance to Schedule I, II, or III will automatically result in that substance being added to the list.\nTesting for banned substances.\nSteroids.\nTesting is administered via scientifically-validated urine test.\nEach Player shall be tested upon reporting to spring training. All Players will be selected for an additional unannounced urine specimen collection during the season on a randomly selected date.\nDrugs of abuse.\nTesting for drugs of abuse is not administered randomly, but on a basis of reasonable cause. If one of the HPAC panel members has evidence that a player has used, possessed, or sold banned substances in the last 12 months, they call a conference and discuss the evidence with the other members. If a majority vote to test the suspected player is reached then testing will take place no more than 48 hours later. Drugs of abuse include natural cannabinoids (e.g., THC, hashish and marijuana), synthetic THC and cannabimimetics (e.g., K2 and Spice), cocaine, LSD, opiates (e.g., oxycodone, heroin, codeine, and morphine), MDMA (ecstasy), GHB and phencyclidine (PCP).\nTesting procedure.\nPlayers and the collector must instruct the player to return in an hour, during which he can only drink 15 oz. of fluid in a sealed container(s) certified by the collector.\nTesting protocols.\nAny test conducted under the Program will be considered \"positive\" under the following circumstances:\nSteroids.\nA test is considered positive if a sufficient amount of Steroid is present, except the presence of nandrolone, which is considered positive only if the level exceeds 2 ng/ml.\nStimulants.\nThe presence of a Stimulant shall be considered a positive only if the level exceeds 250 ng/ml, unless specified otherwise below:\nNotification.\nHPAC immediately notifies the Player and the Club of the positive drug test result.\nIn-Season testing.\nOn January 10, 2013, MLB and the players union reached an agreement to add random, in-season human growth hormone and to a new test to reveal the use of testosterone. Testing began the 2013 season.\nClinical and administrative tracks.\nAll players who enter the program are placed on the Clinical track, except when a player tests positive for steroids, does not comply with the initial evaluation, cooperate in his treatment, is convicted or pleads guilty or \"nolo contendere\" to the sale or use and prohibited substance, or participates in the sale or distribution of any banned substance. In that event, the player is placed in the Administrative Track. HPAC has the discretion to place a player in the Administrative Track in any other event, but not solely on the basis that the player is in an inpatient treatment program. Transfer to the Administrative track is contingent on a majority vote, and in the case of a tie, a fifth member must cast a vote based on reasonable cause and cannot consider past practice.\nThese votes are tallied and set forth in progressing games\nSalary retention.\nPlayers are entitled to salary retention for the first 30 days they are required to be in inpatient treatment or outpatient treatment that forces his absence from the Club, and half salary retention for the next thirty days, over the course of his career. However, players are not entitled to salary retention for any such period after 60 days during the course of his career.\nPlayer evaluations.\nPlayers are required to be evaluated at least once by HPAC, to determine the proper treatment program. HPAC may decide that additional meetings and medical and/or toxicology examinations are required.\nConfidentiality.\nThe Office of the Commissioner, the Association, HPAC, Club personnel, and all of their members, affiliates, agents, consultants and employees, are prohibited from publicly disclosing information about the Player's test results, Initial Evaluation, diagnosis, Treatment Program (including whether a Player is on either the Clinical or Administrative Track), prognosis or compliance with the Program.\nDiscipline.\nFailure to comply with treatment program.\nAll suspensions are without pay.\nConviction for use of prohibited substances.\nAll suspensions are without pay."

        "text": "In February 2004, Major League Baseball announced a new drug policy which originally included random, offseason testing and 10-day suspensions for first-time offenders, 30 days for second-time offenders, 60 days for third-time offenders, and one year for fourth-time offenders, all without pay, in an effort to curtail performance-enhancing drug use (PED) in professional baseball. This policy strengthened baseball's pre-existing ban on controlled substances, including steroids, which has been in effect since 1991. The policy was to be reviewed in 2008, but under pressure from the U.S. Congress, on November 15, 2005, players and owners agreed to tougher penalties; a 50-game suspension for a first offense, a 100-game suspension for a second, and a lifetime ban for a third.\nIn December 2009, \"Sports Illustrated\" named baseball's steroid scandal of performance-enhancing drugs as the number one sports story of the decade of the 2000s.\nThe current penalties, adopted on March 28, 2014, are 80 games for a first offense, 162 games for a second offense, and a permanent suspension (\"lifetime ban\") for a third. Players are also ineligible from participating in the post-season the same year they receive a suspension, regardless of when their suspension is completed, unless the penalty is reduced on appeal. Players receiving a permanent suspension can apply to the Commissioner of Baseball for reinstatement after one year, which if granted can occur not sooner than two years after the suspension started.\nSuspended players.\nPlayers are ordered by the announced date of their suspension, placed in the appropriate table per their MLB experience and roster status \"at the time they were suspended\". Players who are active in professional baseball (not limited to MLB) are listed in italics; players who have retired or have been a free agent for over a year are not considered \"active\".\nPlayers who were on major league rosters.\nPlayers listed in this section were active in MLB at the time of their suspension.\nPlayers with major league experience on minor league rosters or free agents.\nThis table lists players with prior MLB experience who, at the time of their suspension, were in Minor League Baseball or were a free agent.\nPlayers with only minor league experience.\nThis table lists players who, at the time of their suspension, were in Minor League Baseball with no prior MLB experience. Various of these players completed their suspensions and later played in MLB.\nPlayers with major league experience in a non-affiliated professional league.\nThis table lists players with prior MLB experience who, at the time of their suspension, were in a baseball league not affiliated with MLB, such as Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan or KBO League in Korea."

        "title": "Penn State Golf Courses",
        "text": "The Penn State Golf Courses are two 18-hole courses located in State College, Pennsylvania, operated by Pennsylvania State University. The individual 18-hole courses are named after the school colors, blue and white. They, along with their practice facilities, are the home of the men's and women's golf team and all intramural golf activities of the university. The practice facilities include a double-sided driving range with both natural grass and artificial teeing areas, and several putting greens located throughout the facility.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nGolf has been played at the university since the first rise in popularity of the sport in the United States in the latter half of the 19th century. However, the sport was not popular enough to merit a formalized golf course until 1921 when two professors, Bob Rutherford and R.D. Pryde, laid out nine holes on the west end of campus. The sport apparently became quite popular as nine additional holes were laid out in 1922 by noted golf course architect Willie Park, Jr., with the work being completed in 1926. While keeping the general layout of the initial nine holes, Park significantly altered the greens and bunkers to match his own style of design.\nThe Willie Park course came to be known as the College Golf Course, since the school had yet to be named a full-fledged university. The course featured large push-up style greens and some dramatic bunkering much like those found at Park's Sunningdale (Old) Course. Wide fairways and closely mown areas around the green integrated the features together and provided a diverse play field for Penn State golfers.\nTwo notable changes were made to the golf course during this beginning era. Sometime between the opening of the course in 1926 and 1939, the first hole was abandoned. The first tee had been located near the golf pro shop in Rec Hall, however, the site also doubled as the dirt road that would become Atherton Street (U.S. Highway 322). This not only presented a logistical problem, but a safety issue as well, and a new hole would be needed. The new hole was constructed near the old hole, but as a par-3 with a new greensite. The old first green is still used to this day in vastly different design as a practice putting green.\nHaving a par-3 as an opening hole proved to be unpopular and it was during this time that the order of holes was switched, with the 10th hole becoming the 1st hole. The new par-3 served as the tenth and the nines were flipped from there.\nAnother set of changes in 1949 included the addition of several large specimen trees planted around the course by Frank James, who served as a construction foreman for Park and other noted golf architect, Donald Ross.\nThe sixties saw an era of increased tree planting on the course, as corridors of play were lined with many small pine trees. The university (a designation earned in 1954) had decided to use the golf course open areas as a test facility for various trees and forestry techniques. While the dual use of the golf course is a noble idea, the tree plants did substantially alter the character and playability of the golf course, and to this day have caused significant changes to be seen.\nBy the late 1960s, changes in technology and a growth in the popularity in the game, mainly led by the professional success of Pennsylvania native Arnold Palmer, created demand for a second course. The university hired the golf architecture firm of Harrison &amp; Grabin (both Penn State graduates) to design what would become the \"Blue\" Course. The University Golf Course's name would be changed to the White Course, but would still exist in the same form. From the beginning the Blue Course was intended to be a better representation of the game during that era, and this most noted in its total length of 7,008 yards (a full longer than the White Course). This course was built farther west of the White Course and was operated from a separate location off West College Avenue. The 3rd Hole of the Blue Course ran next to and parallel to the 13th hole of the White Course.\nThe Blue Course became the home course for all intercollegiate golf competitions at Penn State, primarily because of its length.\nBy 1993, the expansion of the university and the inconvenience of running the golf operation from two separate locations lead Penn State to consider new alternatives regarding the golf courses. Noted golf architecture firm Ault, Clark &amp; Associates (ACA) developed a master plan that would retrofit both courses to be run from the Blue Course's West College Avenue site and add an additional nine holes to become the second nine of a new Blue Course.\nThe plan changed several holes on the existing Blue and White Courses. These changes eliminated the existing 3rd, 8th and 9th holes of the Blue Course, and also the 13th hole of the White to allow for a new White Course front nine consisting of the remaining holes from the old Blue. The new back nine for the Blue Course reflecting a typical ACA design. Six holes that did not fit in the new White Course routing were retained as a small practice course.\nThe opening of a new clubhouse in 1994 signalled the new era of Penn State golf. However, university expansion necessitated the destruction and development of the six hole course, which had been dubbed the \"Nittany Course\". These holes were completely eliminated by 2002.\n21st century.\nAs of November 2005, work was done on some significant renovations to both courses. Tree removal and the construction of new tee boxes to add length, major changes to the 7th and 8th holes of the Blue Course were completed in the spring of 2007. The new \"Lion\" tees now measure Par 72. Several changes were also made to the Nittany Lion golf teams practice facilities. In August 2007 a area short-game practice facility was opened that is for the exclusive use of the Nittany Lions Men's and Women's Varsity Teams. The area includes two greens with one used exclusively for putting and one attached to a and fairway for wedge practice.\nCross Country.\nThe Blue and White Courses host home meets for the Penn State Nittany Lions men's and women's cross country teams."

A collegiate All-American at Oregon, Ballard averaged 12.4 points and 6.1 rebounds over an eleven-season NBA career with the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors and briefly, the Seattle SuperSonics.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Los Angeles to parents William Ballard and Annie Clark, Ballard had three brothers and four sisters. Ballard graduated from Garey High School in Pomona, California, in 1973, where he also played baseball. A pitcher, Ballard was selected by the Montreal Expos in the 10th round (137th overall) of the 1973 Amateur Draft.\nCollege career.\nBallard chose basketball and attended the University of Oregon, where he played in the collegiate level at the forward position.\nPlaying for Coach Dick Harter at Oregon, from 1973 to 1977, Ballard played 115 career games on Oregon teams with the nickname \"Kamikaze Kids,\" along with teammates Ernie Kent, Stu Jackson and Ron Lee.\nIn his career at Oregon, Ballard had 1,114 career rebounds, still the most in program history, averaging 9.7 rebounds. He averaged 15.9 points, with his 1,829 total career points, ranking fourth in school history.\nBallard set Oregon's single-game scoring record of 43 points, in a National Invitation Tournament game against Oral Roberts University on March 9, 1977.\nNBA career.\nWashington Bullets (1977–1985).\nBallard was selected by the Washington Bullets with the 4th overall pick in the 1st round of the 1977 NBA draft, behind Kent Benson (Milwaukee Bucks), Otis Birdsong (Kansas City Kings), and Marques Johnson (Milwaukee Bucks).

Ballard worked a total of 21 seasons as an assistant coach and a scout for a number of franchises, including the Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks.\nPersonal life.\nBallard died on November 9, 2016, from prostate cancer. Ballard was survived by his wife Donna, and their children, Lawrence, Gabrielle and Gregory Jr.\n“I would say this about Greg Ballard – and you can ask any question you want but my opening statement would be – for a guy who played in the league for 10 years and was a good player, I found him to be one of the most humble people I have ever met in my life,” said Gary Schmidt, a colleague as a scout for the Boston Celtics. “There was no agenda, there was no attitude, there was no hey-I-played-in-the-league. He was so down to Earth and humble. Just a very good person. Always positive and upbeat.”"

        "text": "A brace on a square-rigged ship is a rope (\"line\") used to rotate a yard around the mast, to allow the ship to sail at different angles to the wind. Braces are always used in pairs, one at each end of a yard (\"yardarm\"), termed port brace and starboard brace of a given yard or sail (e.g., the starboard main-brace is the brace fixed to the right end of the yard of the main sail).\nThe braces are fixed to the outer ends of the yards, and are led to the deck as far aft as possible, to allow the crew to haul on them. The lower yards' braces can usually run directly to the deck, but to do so with those higher up would mean that most of the force was pulling downwards rather than backwards. Instead, the braces for the upper yards run to another mast and thence to the deck. On the aftermost mast, this may mean they have to be led forwards instead of backwards. Braces from the aftermost mast that run to the very stern of the ship often pass through blocks attached to short outriggers projecting from the side of the ship in order to improve their lead. These projections are called \"bumkins\" and can be seen in the picture.\nIn many ways, braces are the equivalent of a modern yacht's sheets. However, where adjusting a sail on a yacht is a simple operation performed often, tacking or wearing ship using the braces usually requires the entire crew to be called to \"bracing stations\". This is because the braces carry heavy loads but have few blocks and hence each one needs many people hauling, and because most ships with braces have many sails and hence many such teams. For this reason, all manoeuvres require plenty of notice (one reason falling overboard is especially to be avoided from such a ship) and routine course changes may be planned well in advance for a time when as few of the crew as possible wish to be asleep.\nThe sails on a tall ship's mast must all be turned together, because of all the gear that runs between them. The rate of turn is set by the course, the heaviest yard and hence the most difficult to move. The teams on the other braces for that mast must watch the course and keep their own yard in line with it. The braces may be marked with leather tags or twine seizings to indicate the centre (\"square\") position and the two extremes, though these marks may not always be accurate due to stretch in the line."

The following season he moved to Sydney to play in the NSWRFL Premiership.\n1973.\nRogers began playing first grade rugby league at the age of eighteen for the Cronulla-Sutherland club in 1973. Playing the position of centre, his talent did not go unnoticed. He was described by the club's captain/coach, Tommy Bishop as a \"rare, rare talent – the greatest all round centre three-quarter I have seen.\" In that year, he played in his first Grand final, which Cronulla lost to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and made the first of three Kangaroo Tours.\n1974–1982.\nRogers led Cronulla to the grand final as captain, in 1978, once more against the Sea Eagles. The match was a tie, and Cronulla lost a replay in the following week. During that season, he was often switched to lock forward and was effective in that role. Three years later, he won the Dally M Lock of the Year award.\nIn 1975 Rogers won the Rothmans Medal for best and fairest player in the NSWRFL. He played for New South Wales in 1980's first state of origin match. He was named player of the series in the 1981 Tooth Cup tournament and also won that year's Dally M Award.\nRogers was selected to tour with the Australian national rugby league team on the 1973 Kangaroo Tour. National honours continued when he was selected in the Australian squad for the 1975 Rugby League World Cup, 1977 Rugby League World Cup, 1978 Kangaroo tour, 1980 Tour of New Zealand and was a centre in all three tests against Great Britain and the two tests against France on the 1982 Kangaroo Tour, as well as playing in the pre-tour test against Papua New Guinea. Rogers would captain the Kangaroos in the two 1981 home tests against France.\n1983–1984.\nAs a result of Cronulla's serious financial difficulties, Rogers signed for 1983 with Cronulla's local rival, the St. George Dragons. He played with them for two seasons, culminating in playing five-eighth in the Saints 1984 reserve grade Grand Final (a side which featured others such as Michael O'Connor), which the Dragons lost.\n1985–1986.\nRogers returned to Cronulla in 1985, but only played nine minutes in the season after breaking his jaw in his first game of the year against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, in a tackle from Mark Bugden.\nIn 1986 Rogers signed with Widnes in the English competition, but only played for 13 minutes before breaking his leg in his first game of the year against Wigan. This was the last game of his career.\nPost playing.\nAfter retiring from the playing field Rogers remained involved with rugby league coaching. He coached for a time in Queensland, and worked in administrative roles for the Australian Rugby League in Darwin and Perth. After an unsuccessful business venture running a hotel at Lennox Head, Rogers became involved once more with the Cronulla club, becoming the football manager and later, Chief Executive Officer of the club.\nHis personal life was marred by tragedy. After losing his father (Don) and mother (Marj) to cancer, his wife Carol also died from the disease on 11 May 2001. Rogers's brother also committed suicide.\nOn 3 January 2006, Rogers was found dead outside the door of his Cronulla unit. Initial reports of a heart attack soon turned to suggestions of suicide as the existence of three letters—apparently suicide notes to his three children—was revealed. His son Mat also confirmed that his father had been suffering from depression: \"He was suffering from some depression and, as a person of his stature and a public figure, he found it really hard to talk about it to other people and therefore exacerbated the problem,\" he said. Police believed that he had swallowed a cocktail of alcohol and prescription drugs. There has been some speculation that Rogers may have attempted to make an emergency telephone call in the moments before his death.\nAccolades.\nIn February 2008, Rogers was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. While playing football, Rogers also served in the New South Wales Police Force and in 2008, rugby league's centennial year in Australia, he was named at five-eighth in a NSW Police team of the century. Also in 2008 Rogers was named in New South Wales' rugby league team of the century.\nOpen Rugby inaugural World XIII.\nThe Open Rugby inaugural World XIII was revealed in June 1978: Graham Eadie, John Atkinson, Steve Rogers, Jean-Marc Bourret, Green Vigo, Roger Millward, Steve Nash, Jim Mills, Keith Elwell, Steve Pitchford, Terry Randall, George Nicholls and Greg Pierce."

        "title": "Andorra national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Andorra national rugby union team, nicknamed \"Els Isards\" (which is a Pyrenean Chamois) represent the Andorran Rugby Federation (FAR) in international rugby union competitions. They play most of their home games in Andorra la Vella, the country's capital, though have had some matches in Foix, which is in France.\nThey compete in the European Nations Cup, and are currently in the second division. As well as playing numerous friendlies they have also taken part in the qualification stages of the Rugby World Cup, competing in every tournament since 1995.\nThe national side is ranked 88th in the world, as of 16 January 2023.\nHistory.\nThe first international game that Andorra played was on 8 November 1987 when they took on Luxembourg in the third division of the 1987–89 FIRA Trophy. Andorra would win that match 24–3 to receive their only win in the third division as they lost both games to Bulgaria and the reverse game. After qualifying for the second division in the following year, they would finish bottom of their group which would feature Morocco, Tunisia and Portugal.\nAndorra attempted to qualify for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. They competed in the preliminary round in the west group of the European qualification. They defeated Denmark, but lost to Switzerland, and were knocked out.\nAndorra also attempted to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Andorra started off in Pool 3 of Round 1, and won all four of their fixtures, finishing at the top of the final standings to advance through to Round 2. However they were then knocked out of qualifying after Round 2 coming last in a five team group.\nThey competed in Pool B of Round 1 in attempting to qualify for the 2003 World Cup, but did not advance to the next stage coming third in a six team group.\nThe 2007 tournament saw many more fixtures and gained the small nation some greater publicity by playing in the first match of the tournament, beating Norway 76–3. They won a 2 leg match, came third in the ensuing five team group thus qualifying for a further 2 leg playoff, victory in which led to a further five team group in which they were last. Competing with the more populous Moldova, Netherlands, Spain and Poland, having beaten Norway, Hungary, Slovenia and Sweden certainly brought Andorra to the attention of more rugby followers, all in spite of a small population of just 70,000.\nPopularity.\nThe popularity of football in Andorra has been on the decline due to a poor record at home and away. This has left room for Andorran rugby to rise out of the shadows. Mainly affected by the fanatical popularity of rugby in southern France, Els Isards continue to impress on the international stage. This has led to the rapid increase in the number of registered players in Andorra. Many are now suggesting that rugby in Andorra has grown to such an extent that it has now become the tiny nation's national sport.\nAs well as a men's 15 aside team, the men have competed in the European Sevens competition since 2005. In 2005 they won promotion to the next division and in both 2006 and 2007 made the finals of the competition.\nAlso Andorra have a women's set up. They have only played sevens so far, competing in 2006 and 2007.\nYouth rugby in Andorra is less developed and has to date only consisted of training camps.\nMen's 15-a-side results.\nAnalysis.\nAndorra have played friendlies, FIRA competitions and World Cup Qualifiers. The full results list including details of unplayed games can be found below. The various game types can be summarised as follows – note that unfulfilled and defaulted games are NOT included in the analysis although they do count towards the game count in the full list. Also if a game has been both a World Cup and FIRA game then it is only recorded here in the World Cup figures.\nMatches against individual teams can be summarised as follows\nCurrent squad.\nStarting line-up for opening 2023-24 Rugby Europe Conference match against Denmark."

Kazakhstan have been participating in international competition since 1994 after their independence from the USSR.\nIn 2007, the fortunes of the team greatly improved by winning all five of their matches and rising 14 places in the IRB World Rankings to 32nd. This rise was the biggest by any international team over the year. This led to the team being entered into the top division of the new Asian Five Nations in 2008.\nKazakhstan are now one of the leading rugby union nations in Asia, finishing second in the 2009 and 2010 Asian Five Nations to continent heavyweights Japan on both occasions. Their second-place finish in 2010 saw them advance to the four-team playoff for a final place at the 2011 Rugby World Cup. They lost 44–7 to Uruguay in Montevideo, being eliminated but it was still their best result yet.\nThey have yet to qualify for a Rugby World Cup finals.\nAsian Five Nations Record.\nAsia Rugby Championship"

        "text": "John Lowell McLaren (born September 29, 1951) is an American former professional baseball coach and manager. He is best known for his brief tenure as manager of the Seattle Mariners, from July 1, to June 19, . A native of the Houston, Texas area, McLaren was a catcher in the Houston Astros minor league system from 1970 to 1976, and later managed in the Toronto Blue Jays minor league system.\nHe became a major league coach with the Blue Jays in 1986 and has since held major league coaching positions with the Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Washington Nationals. He also served as a coach for the United States national baseball team during the 2006 World Baseball Classic, spent two nonconsecutive seasons as a scout in the Devil Rays/Rays organization, and was interim manager of the Nationals for three games in 2011. He was employed as a professional scout for the Oakland Athletics organization from 2012 to 2015. He was the catching coach for the Philadelphia Phillies under manager Pete Mackanin for the 2016 season.\nEarly life.\nMcLaren graduated from Westbury High School in Houston in 1970, and attended Blinn College, the University of St. Thomas and Houston Baptist University.\nPlaying career.\nMcLaren, a catcher, was selected by the Houston Astros in the seventh round of the 1970 June MLB draft and was assigned to the rookie-level Covington Astros of the Appalachian League. He hit a home run in his first professional game on June 30.\nHe led Western Carolinas League catchers in putouts and assists in 1971, and in 1973 at Columbus led Southern League catchers in fielding. His best offensive season came in 1975, when he batted .270 with 13 home runs and 57 runs batted in for the Iowa Oaks and Dubuque Packers. His playing career lasted through the 1976 season, having peaked at the triple-A level.\nCoaching and managing career.\nIn the 1979 season McLaren became manager of the Utica Blue Jays, a Toronto Blue Jays short-season single-A affiliate. He managed two other Blue Jays affiliates: the single-A Kinston Blue Jays from 1981–1982, and the double-A Knoxville Blue Jays from 1983–1985.\nMcLaren entered MLB as the Blue Jays' third-base coach in . He coached for the Blue Jays through , then spent as bullpen coach for the Boston Red Sox before joining Lou Piniella's coaching staff with the Cincinnati Reds in . He held various positions on Piniella's coaching staffs with the Seattle Mariners and Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 1993 through 2005.\nMcLaren served as the third-base coach for the United States during the 2006 World Baseball Classic, but worked as a scout for the Devil Rays during the 2006 season. After the season, McLaren was named bench coach of the Mariners for the third time, this time under manager Mike Hargrove. Hargrove abruptly resigned on July 1, 2007, and McLaren was named as his replacement. The Mariners finished the season in second place in the American League West standings, the first time they finished above last place since .\nMcLaren was fired as manager on June 19, 2008, largely because the Mariners had a payroll in excess of $100 million, yet possessed the worst record in baseball (25–47) at the time. His firing followed the firing of general manager Bill Bavasi by three days. Jim Riggleman, the bench coach, replaced McLaren on an interim basis.\nMcLaren spent the season as a scout in the Rays organization and in November 2009 was hired as the Washington Nationals' bench coach under manager Riggleman. He became interim manager of the Nationals on June 24, 2011, a day following Riggleman's resignation, and was ejected in his first game as interim manager against the Chicago White Sox; he was replaced with Davey Johnson for the remainder of the 2011 season after McLaren managed three games. McLaren subsequently resigned his coaching position and took a position as a scout for the Nationals organization.\nHonors.\nIn 1991, McLaren was inducted into the Kinston Professional Baseball Hall of Fame."

On December 13, the Lakers needed to find a replacement for suspended power forward Kermit Washington, so Edwards was traded along with shooting guard Earl Tatum and cash considerations to the Indiana Pacers, in exchange for small forward Adrian Dantley and center Dave Robisch.\nIndiana Pacers (1977–1981).\nEdwards enjoyed arguably his most productive years with the Indiana Pacers. He became the franchise's highest-scoring center, averaging 15.9 points over four seasons and also posted 7.5 rebounds per contest.

He was a key reserve of the consecutive champion in 1989 and 1990 Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys squads, starting most of the team's games in 1990. On June 7 of that year, during Game 2 of the 1990 NBA Finals, Edwards scored a team-leading 26 points during a 105–106 loss to Portland. The Pistons would go on to win the series in five games.\nHe averaged 11.2 points and 3.6 rebounds as a Piston. His Fu Manchu mustache and stoic demeanor, inspired his nickname of Buddha.\nLos Angeles Clippers (1991–1992).\nOn August 13, 1991, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for shooting guard Jeff Martin and a 1995 2nd round draft pick (#30-Lou Roe).

Edwards was indicted on three counts, conspiracy to possess a narcotic drug, conspiracy to transfer a narcotic drug, and conspiracy to transfer or possess marijuana. Former Suns player Walter Davis was involved and was offered immunity in exchange for testimony, but his testimony failed to reveal critical details. Edwards, along with all other defendants, never went to trial, but was required to undergo a drug counseling program as settlement."

        "text": "Steven Charles Shields (born July 19, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. During his playing career, which lasted from 1994 to 2006, he played ten seasons in the National Hockey League with the Buffalo Sabres, San Jose Sharks, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Florida Panthers, and Atlanta Thrashers.\nPlaying career.\nShields grew up in North Bay, Ontario, playing minor hockey until bantam level with the local Athletics AA program of the NOHA. At age 16, Shields moved to southern Ontario to play for the St. Marys Lincolns Jr.B. club of the OHA before accepting a scholarship to the University of Michigan.\nAs a collegiate player, Shields became the first goalie in NCAA history to record 100 career victories and was a two-time All American.\nShields was drafted in the fifth round (#101 overall) in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres out of the University of Michigan. Shields was a journeyman NHL goaltender over his tenure. In his NHL career, Shields would play for the Buffalo Sabres, San Jose Sharks, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Boston Bruins, Florida Panthers, and Atlanta Thrashers. \n1996 AHL Calder Cup champion.\nAfter starting the season with only a .500 record, the Rochester Americans rallied late in the season to go on and win the Calder Cup in game seven defeating the Portland Pirates 2-1. Steve Shields set an American Hockey League record with 15 playoff victories. John Tortorella was the coach.\n1997 playoffs.\nOne of his career highlights was during the 1997 playoffs, when Dominik Hašek was injured. Hašek had been the team MVP and the league's best goalie during the regular season and he had been considered crucial to the Sabres' playoff hopes. With Hašek leaving in the midst of game three of the first round, Shields was forced to step in but he helped the Sabres to rally and defeat the Ottawa Senators.\nShields then played the second round series against the Philadelphia Flyers, as Hašek was suspended for three games after an altercation with reporter Jim Kelley. A line brawl between the two teams broke out in game one that resulted in a memorable goaltender fight between Shields and the Flyers' Garth Snow. Hašek was set to return in game four with the team down by three games in the series, but he told the Sabres' coaching staff he felt a twinge in his knee and left the ice after the pregame skate. Shields turned in another season-saving performance as Buffalo staved off the almost inevitable sweeping elimination with a win. Again before the fifth game, Hašek declared himself unfit to play and Shields would finish the series with Buffalo losing 6–3 and being eliminated.\n1999–2000 season.\nShields's best season was in the 1999–2000 season, when he played in 67 games for the San Jose Sharks while posting respectable goaltending numbers for the team (27 wins, 30 losses, four shutouts, a 2.56 GAA, and a .911 save percentage). San Jose made it to the second round of the playoffs that year.\nGoalie mask design.\nShields had a notable goalie mask which was designed while he was a member of the Boston Bruins during the 2002-03 season. Shields's mask was a tribute to former Bruins goalie Gerry Cheevers famed \"stitch mask\". He continued wearing the stitch mask after he was traded to the Florida Panthers, and being signed by the Atlanta Thrashers.\nCoaching career.\nShields served under Mel Pearson as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan Tech for two seasons from 2011 to 2013 before joining the Florida Panthers as a goaltending consultant in the summer of 2013.\nOn May 7, 2015, it was announced that Shields was named a volunteer assistant coach for the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team."

The following season, he failed to make the team's roster out of training camp. He was placed on waivers and once he cleared, was assigned to the Providence Bruins, Boston's AHL affiliate. After the 2008–09 season, the final year remaining on Schaefer's contract was bought out by the Bruins on June 30, 2009.\nSchaefer did not play in the 2009–10 season, training extensively to make an NHL comeback while living in West Vancouver. After being invited to the Vancouver Canucks' 2010 training camp on a tryout basis, he was signed to a one-year, two-way, contract worth $600,000 on October 7, 2010. However, after 16 games, he was put on waivers by Vancouver in November 2010. Unwilling to play in the minors, the club put him on waivers a second time in order to release him. Schaefer's agent said both sides were amicable in the departure, agreeing to simply terminate the contract. Becoming an unrestricted free agent, he signed overseas with German team ERC Ingolstadt of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in January 2011.\nAfter his playing career ended, Schaefer became an assistant coach of the Surrey Eagles of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) for the 2012–13 season.

He also played many seasons in the AHL and Europe. His younger sister Falin played volleyball for the Canadian national team."

When a player's health bar flashes red, more moves can be performed as long as the player does not restore or completely lose health. There are items throughout the game that include American and Japanese food for restoring health, alternate weapons such as baseballs and shurikens, or items that call cheerleaders to either obliterate enemies on screen or drop a large amount of food. There are also mini-games after each boss before the final one is defeated.\nDevelopment.\nIrem America opened its U.S. office in 1988 in Redmond, Washington, headed up by Frank Ballouz (founder of Fabtek, a thriving video kit company and former North American publisher of several arcade machines by Seibu Kaihatsu and TAD Corporation) and National Sales Manager Drew Maniscalco. During this time, Drew created the \"Ninja Baseball Bat Man\" video game concept (including the English title, plot and characters) and licensed it to Irem America in 1991.\nDrew's concept came up after he read the top-grossing films during its time in a \"USA Today\" newspaper. One was \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"; the other was one of the Batman films (possibly \"Batman Returns\"). After that, he started creating his own superhero influenced by what he saw in the USA Today newspaper. During the development of his concept, he liked the word \"ninja\", because of it sounding mysterious to him. He gave the protagonists baseball bats and baseballs as their main weapons, as well as dressing them in baseball uniforms, because Drew is a baseball fan. Drew thought the baseball bat idea was also probably influenced by the 1973 film \"Walking Tall\". This was also how he came up with the game's English title. In Japan, however, Irem of Japan's staff came up with the game's Japanese name as a reference to numerous tokusatsu television shows, most notably the Super Sentai series. Drew later created the concept for the other characters such as enemies. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb pinball artist Gordon Morison.\nDrew's original gameplay ideas for the video game was for a 1-player, adventure-based, platform game similar to Nintendo's \"Super Mario Bros.\", but due to the very successful game sales of several 4-player games (most of them being beat 'em ups), Drew added 3-players in an effort to compete with the 4-player games. While the title and characters were Drew's concept, Irem Japan programmed the arcade game, and modified the look of its prototype. Drew did not mind it being different, as he was thrilled about it being programmed by them.\nDuring the development of the two-player platform version, the two main characters were named \"Willie\" and \"Mickey\", named after Drew's two favorite baseball players of his childhood, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. During the development of the 4-player beat 'em up version, the prototype names of the four main characters were Captain Jeff (red), Nunchaks Sugar (green), Hammer' Eddy (yellow) and Naginata Jimmy (blue). Drew later came up with the final names of the four protagonists that are currently used in the finished version today, which the names are references to the four baseball stars during the arcade game's release: Jose Canseco (red), Ryne Sandberg (green), Roger Clemens (yellow) and Darryl Strawberry (blue). In Japan, their last names were changed to the names of their colors.\nReception and legacy.\nDespite being one of the top arcade hits of Japan while receiving good reviews from critics during its 1993 release, when compared to the sales of other kits sold at the time, it sold poorly in the Far East and especially North America. Of the 1042 units sold, only 50 units were sold in North America, making \"Ninja Baseball Bat Man\" quite rare (especially in the U.S.). Drew \"was very disappointed with the effort by the US office\". Despite all of this, the popularity of the arcade emulator MAME caused \"Ninja Baseball Bat Man\" to gain more popularity years later than it had when originally released.\nA year after its concept was created and a year before it was released, despite it being interesting in his opinion, Drew left the company in 1992 and moved to Data East USA. Because of that, he was unable to market nor manage any other input related to the game, but according to his interview with \"GameRoom\", he now owns the rights to \"Ninja Baseball Bat Man\"s non-video game products, while Irem Japan owns the rights to its video game content."

        "text": "Jason Paul Taylor (born September 1, 1974) is an American football coach and former player who is the defensive ends coach at the University of Miami. He played as a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League (NFL), spending the majority of his career with the Miami Dolphins. Over the course of his 15-year career, Taylor played for the Dolphins for 13 years in three separate stints (1997–2007, 2009, 2011), and also played a season each for the Washington Redskins (2008) and the New York Jets (2010).\nTaylor was a four-year letterman and three-year starter playing college football for the Akron Zips before being selected by the Dolphins in the third round of the 1997 NFL draft with the 73rd overall pick.\nTaylor won the Dolphins Team Newcomer of the Year award during his rookie season in 1997, and from then on, quickly established himself as one of the league's best performing defensive ends and pass-rushers in NFL history. He is currently ranked first in Dolphins history for the most games played by a defensive player in team history, with 204 games (including a defensive team record 130 consecutive games), and is also the Miami Dolphins all-time sack leader with 131 sacks. Overall, Taylor is currently 7th on the NFL all-time career sacks list with 139.5 sacks. Taylor has the 4th most forced fumbles of all time with 46, and is the all-time leader in fumble return touchdowns with six, and interceptions returned for touchdowns by a defensive lineman with three, while his 246 fumble return yards are the 4th-highest total in NFL history. With nine career defensive touchdowns scored, he is also the all-time leader in that category for defensive linemen. He officially announced his retirement on December 28, 2011.\nThroughout his career with the Dolphins, Taylor won numerous team awards including a team record four Dolphins Team MVP awards (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006), and a team record four Dolphins Team Leadership Awards (2002, 2006–2007, 2009). Along with being a six-time Pro Bowl selection, four-time first (3) or second (1) team All-Pro, a two-time NFL Alumni Defensive Linemen of the Year (2005-2006), and the NFL Alumni Pass-Rusher of the Year in 2000, Taylor was also a two-time AFC Defensive Player of the Year (2002, 2006), and was also named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2006. He was named the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2007, selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, and enshrined into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll in 2012. In 2017, Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\nEarly years.\nJason Taylor grew up around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and played high school football for Woodland Hills High School. He was homeschooled from grades 10 through 12.\nCollege career.\nWhile attending the University of Akron, Taylor was a four-year letterman and three-year starter for the Akron Zips football team. He recorded 279 tackles, 21 sacks, seven fumbles recovered, and three interceptions in his college career. He was a two-time first-team All-Mid-American Conference selection as a junior and senior, as well as an All-America pick as a junior. As a junior, he played weakside linebacker and moved to left defensive end as a senior. In 1996, he earned National Defensive Player of the Week honors for his performance against Virginia Tech when he posted 12 tackles, two sacks, two fumble recoveries, three stops for loss and tackled a punt returner in the end zone for a safety.\nTaylor also started for the Akron Zips men's basketball team. In 2004, he became the third person ever inducted into Akron's Ring of Honor. He majored in political science and criminal justice.\nProfessional career.\nMiami Dolphins.\nTaylor was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the third round (73rd pick overall) of the 1997 NFL draft. Taylor signed a four-year deal worth approximately $1.3 million in July 1997. From there he established himself as one of the premier defensive ends in the league. He became a starter in his rookie season and recorded five sacks and forced two fumbles.\nThe following season, 1998, Taylor recorded nine sacks and batted away eight passes. In 1999 Taylor grabbed the first of his eight career NFL interceptions.\n2000–2003.\nOn April 15, 2000, Taylor, a restricted free agent, received a one-year tender that earned him $1.027 million in 2000. Taylor responded with 73 tackles, 14.5 sacks, and 6 passes batted for the Dolphins that season. His performance was rewarded with his first selection to the Pro Bowl.\nOn July 24, 2001, he signed a six-year, $42 million contract to remain with the Dolphins. The new contract replaced the one-year, $5.39 million deal the Dolphins tendered Taylor in February 2001, when he was designated their franchise player. In 2001 Taylor recorded 70 tackles (15 for a loss), 8.5 sacks and swatted away eight passes.\nIn 2002, Taylor led the NFL and tied the Dolphin team record for sacks with 18.5. He also forced seven fumbles and knocked down eight more passes to go with his 69 tackles. He was a consensus All-Pro selection and returned to the Pro Bowl. The next season (2003) Taylor followed up his All-Pro performances with a 13-sack season.\n2004–2005.\nOn March 1, 2004, the Dolphins, in an effort to create more salary cap space, agreed to a three-year contract extension with Taylor. The extension put Taylor under contract through the 2009 season. The new deal (which replaced his 6-year, $42 million contract that was scheduled to expire in 2006) was worth $45 million over the 2004–2009 seasons, including nearly $10 million guaranteed in 2004. In 2004 Taylor had 68 tackles, 9.5 sacks, batted 11 passes and picked off a pass. He followed that up with a 73-tackle, 12-sack showing in 2005. He also knocked down 10 passes and forced four fumbles.\n2006.\nTaylor enjoyed one of the best years of his career in 2006 when he recorded 13.5 sacks, 9 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries, and two interceptions (both of which were returned for touchdowns), an effort which resulted in his selection as the 2006 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. On January 5, 2007, Taylor received 22 votes from a panel of 50 sportswriters and broadcasters who cover the NFL. Taylor beat Denver Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey, who received 16 votes. Shawne Merriman received six votes, and the winner of the award in 2005, Brian Urlacher of the Chicago Bears, received four votes. Taylor was also named a consensus All-Pro for the second time in his career.\n2007.\nIn 2007 Taylor reached double-digits in sacks for the sixth time in his career and picked off another pass (the 7th of his career, and the 3rd returned for a TD). Five of his FRs he has returned for TDs, which is an NFL record shared with former Atlanta Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle. With eight career defensive TDs (three on INT returns, five on FR returns), Taylor became the all-time leader in defensive touchdowns scored by a defensive lineman. He has also registered two career safeties and has two career field goal blocks.\nIn 2007 Taylor was voted to the All-time Miami Dolphins team in a poll of Dolphins fans. He was a First-team selection at defensive end along with Bill Stanfill.\nWashington Redskins.\nMiami Dolphins General Manager Jeff Ireland admitted that there were trade discussions regarding veteran defensive end Taylor. Jacksonville Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio acknowledged speaking to the Dolphins about Taylor, \"They had a certain price in mind and nobody in the league was interested in that price\". On Monday April 28, 2008, \"The Miami Herald\" reported that Dolphin President Bill Parcells was displeased that Taylor skipped the Dolphins voluntary off-season workouts to be on Dancing with the Stars and that when \"Taylor walked into a room where Parcells was watching tape, and Parcells ignored him\". Taylor was reportedly \"incensed\". Ireland, on Sunday, April 27, 2008, said that the Dolphins want Taylor back for the 2008 season and regard him as a team leader.\nOn Saturday, April 26, 2008, The \"St. Petersburg Times\" reported that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had agreed to trade at least a second round pick, and perhaps others, to the Dolphins for Taylor. However, when the second round pick was traded to Jacksonville, the paper removed the story from its website. Buccaneers coach Jon Gruden, when asked about trade talks stated, \"There have been some trade rumors and I don’t think we’re any different than anybody else. When you’re talking about high-profile players, we’re going to pick up the phone and see what’s going on. It’s part of our job.\"\nOn July 20, 2008, Taylor was traded to the Washington Redskins for a second-round pick in 2009 (Pat White was selected with the pick) and a sixth-round pick in 2010. The trade came after the Redskins lost two defensive ends - Phillip Daniels and Alex Buzbee - to season-ending injuries on the first day of training camp.\nOn March 2, 2009, Taylor was released by the Washington Redskins for refusing to participate in off-season conditioning programs after claiming he wanted to be closer to his family in Florida.\nMiami Dolphins (second stint).\nOn May 13, 2009, Taylor signed a one-year deal with the Miami Dolphins for $1.1 million with $400,000 in incentives. On November 1, Taylor set the NFL record for most fumble returns for a touchdown with a 48-yard return against the Dolphins' rivals, the New York Jets, and extended his NFL record of most defensive touchdowns scored by a defensive lineman with 9 (6 on fumble returns, 3 on interception returns). In a game against Tampa Bay, Taylor also recorded his 8th and final career interception, which is second all-time for a defensive lineman.\nNew York Jets.\nTaylor signed with the New York Jets on April 20, 2010, to a two-year contract worth up to $13 million with $2.5 million guaranteed. On September 19, 2010, he sacked New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, giving him 128.5 sacks in his career, the 10th-most in NFL history. With 132.5 sacks at the end of the regular season, he was tied for 8th most sacks in a career with Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor and defensive end Leslie O'Neal. On January 23, 2011, Taylor played in his first Conference Championship game in his 14-year career and recorded 2 tackles while the Jets lost, 24–19, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, falling one game short of the Super Bowl for the second straight year.\nAfter one season with the Jets, Taylor was released on February 28, 2011.\nMiami Dolphins (third stint).\nOn August 1, 2011, Taylor signed with the Miami Dolphins for a third stint. During a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Taylor sacked Michael Vick twice giving him seven sacks on the year, and also giving him the sixth-most sacks in NFL history with 139.5, just ahead of Hall of Famers John Randle and Richard Dent.\nRetirement and broadcasting career.\nOn December 28, 2011, Taylor announced that he would retire at the end of the 2011 season. He played his final game on January 1, 2012, in a 19–17 win against his former team, the New York Jets. In the game Taylor nearly returned a fumble for a touchdown, before the score was overruled. After the game ended, Taylor was ceremoniously carried off the field by his teammates. Jason retired 6th on the NFL's all-time sack list with 139.5 sacks, along with 47 career forced fumbles, 29 fumble recoveries with an NFL Record six returned for TDs, and eight career interceptions with three returned for TDs. With nine career defensive touchdowns, he is the NFL's all-time leader in that category for defensive linemen.\nTaylor appeared as a guest analyst for NFL Live on June 6, 2011. On June 6, 2012, it was announced that he would join ESPN as an analyst to contribute to NFL Live, \"SportsCenter\", NFL32 and Sunday and Monday NFL Countdown. Taylor is a board member of NFL Foundation.\nOn October 14, 2012, Taylor along with his teammate Zach Thomas, together became the 23rd and 24th members to be inducted into the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll.\n On February 4, 2017, Taylor was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, becoming the 10th \"long time\" Miami Dolphin to enter Canton, and the fifth Miami Dolphin (joining Jim Langer, Paul Warfield, Don Shula and Dan Marino) to do it his first year of eligibility.\nAwards.\nTaylor has won numerous awards throughout his career, including the 2006 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award, two AFC Defensive Player of the Year awards (2002, 2006), and the 2007 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, the only league honor that recognizes both on-field achievements and off-the-field contributions. Taylor is also a six-time Pro Bowl selection (2000, 2002, 2004–2007), a four-time First or Second-team All-Pro (2000–2002, 2006), a two-time NFL Alumni Association Defensive Lineman of the Year (2005, 2006), and the NFL Alumni Association Pass Rusher of the Year (2000).\nTaylor has also won the \"AFC Defensive Player of the Week\" Award seven times which is fifth most ever by a defensive player, for the following performances:\nAlong with winning seven \"AFC Defensive Player of the Week\" Awards, Taylor has won three \"NFC/AFC Defensive Player of the Month\" Awards, which is the third most ever by a defensive player (trailing only Bruce Smith and John Randle) for the following performances:\nTaylor has also won numerous team awards, including the Dolphins Newcomer of the Year Award (1997), the \"Dan Marino\" Team MVP Award a record four times (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006), and the \"Don Shula\" Team Leadership Award four times (2002, 2006–2007, 2009).\nCharity work.\nIn 2004 Taylor and his wife Katina founded the Jason Taylor Foundation with the goal of improving the lives of children in South Florida. The foundation has launched the Jason Taylor Reading Room, an after-school program aimed at increasing literacy among inner city children; renamed the Holtz Children's Hospital's learning center as \"The Jason Taylor Children's Learning Center\"; provided 11 sixth-grade students with college scholarships through the Take Stock in Children organization; created the \"Big Screens-Big Dreams\" program to screen inspirational films for hundreds of student-athletes; and furnished 60 children with $300 back-to-school shopping certificates as part of the \"Cool Gear for the School Year\" program.\nTaylor has also partnered with the Invicta Watch Group and its CEO, Eyal Lalo, on a number of charitable ventures and was given the opportunity to create a collection of limited edition of watches.

The English cricket team was aspiring to maintain the form that took them to second place in the ICC Test Championship and helped them to win the 2005 Ashes series at home to Australia. This goal was substantially hindered by an injury to the captain Michael Vaughan; the swing bowler Simon Jones and the absence of Ashley Giles who missed the tour for an operation. As well as this, stand-in captain Marcus Trescothick flew home for \"personal reasons\", not wishing to divulge further, leaving Andrew Flintoff, who missed the birth of his son, to take on the title of skipper for the first time having to captain two maiden international cricketers on the English side: Alastair Cook and Monty Panesar. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Piyush Chawla and Munaf Patel made their debuts for the home team.\nThree Test matches and seven One Day Internationals were planned. One ODI (in Guwahati) was washed out because of rain. The Test series was drawn 1-1 while India won the ODI series 5–1.\nTour Matches.\nTour match v Cricket Club of India (18–20 February).\nEngland beat Cricket Club of India by 238 runs\nEngland 1st Innings\n299 all out (89.3 overs)\nCricket Club of India 1st Innings\n251 all out (79.3 overs)\nEngland 2nd Innings\n265 all out (61.5 overs)\nCricket Club of India 2nd Innings\n75 all out (26.2 overs)\nTour match v President's XI (23–25 February).\nPresident's XI beat England by 8 wickets\nEngland 1st Innings\n238 for 9 (62.2 overs)\nPresident's XI 1st Innings\n348 for 8 (103.4 overs)\nEngland 2nd Innings\n158 for 9 (65.0 overs)\nPresident's XI 2nd Innings\n58 for 2 (17.0 overs)\nNote: Munaf Patel took two five-wicket hauls at a combined total of 10-91 for the President's XI and subsequently gained a Test match debut in the Second Test against England.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nBoth Alistair Cook and Monty Panesar made international debuts in this Test for England, as well as a Test debut for ODI veteran Ian Blackwell. On the Indian team Shanthakumaran Sreesanth was the only debutant.\nEngland won the toss and batted first, and scored at a decent enough rate on the first day, but also lost regular wickets in the process to end the day on 246/7. Alastair Cook made a promising debut scoring 60, and Paul Collingwood was 53 not out by the close of play. On day 2, England's lower order batsman assisted Collingwood to reach his maiden test century and frustrate India who would have hoped to bowl England out promptly. England eventually reached a score of 393, with Collingwood unbeaten on 134 not out.\nIndia lost Virender Sehwag early in their reply, but then Wasim Jaffer and Rahul Dravid batted out the day without further loss to take the hosts to 136/1 by the end of day 2. The match was very nicely balanced.\nOn day 3, England's seam bowlers, in particular Matthew Hoggard, produced an inspired performance to engineer a middle order collapse. India slumped from 140/1 to 190/7 just after the lunch break. Hoggard took 5 wickets, and Monty Panesar dismissed Sachin Tendulkar to claim his maiden test wicket amid dramatic scenes. \nHowever, Mohammad Kaif and Anil Kumble fought back for India, putting on 128 for the eighth wicket. The day ended with Kaif being clean bowled by Panesar with a spectacular delivery that span out of the rough and just clipped the off stump.\nEngland wrapped up India's first innings very early on day 4 for 323, and began their second innings in a positive way. Alastair Cook scored a century on debut, and Kevin Pietersen scored an aggressive 87, despite a caught and bowled appeal being turned down by the third umpire early in his innings. This incident distracted the Indians who dropped 3 further catches during the day. England closed the day with a lead of 367 runs, and Cook was unbeaten on 104.\nAndrew Flintoff declared overnight to set India a target of 368 to win. India again lost Sehwag early, but Dravid and Jaffer again formed a solid partnership that England were unable to break for two sessions. Scoring was very slow, and it looked like the match was heading for an uneventful draw.\nJaffer reached 100 shortly after tea but was dismissed soon after making the milestone. India then injected some life into the game by making a sudden charge at the target, despite the fact they still needed 170 runs to win. Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni were promoted up the order to accelerate the scoring, and England had to quickly adopt to a one-day scenario to protect boundaries and try and vary the bowling.\nBoth these batsmen fell after cameos, and Sachin Tendulkar, who had also played some shots, was then trusted with seeing out the remaining overs. Although India scored 129 in 22 overs, they were still 108 runs short of the target, and eventually an offer for bad light was made with the score on 260/6.\nMatthew Hoggard was awarded man of the match for his first innings effort of 6/57. England overall were pleased to hold a strong Indian team to a draw despite several of their key players missing, and went into the second test with renewed confidence.\n3rd Test.\nFollowing their second test defeat, England suffered a further injury blow when Alastair Cook developed an upset stomach on the morning of the match. Owais Shah made his debut for the tourists, and Shaun Udal was also called into the side to replace Liam Plunkett.\nEngland's chances of success in this match were perceived to be low, but they were immediately boosted by Rahul Dravid's curious decision to ask England to bat on winning the toss. It was believed that this decision was based on the perceived weakness of England's spin attack, who would not be able to exploit conditions on the final day of the match.\nAndrew Strauss scored 128 to end a run of low scores on the sub continent, and the debutant Owais Shah compiled a good half century before retiring hurt at the tea interval with cramps. England closed day 1 on 272/3 – a promising position.\nOn day 2, England continued to accumulate runs, but the Indian attack found more consistency than they were able to the previous day. Sri Sreesanth took 4 wickets and triggered a mini collapse, and Munaf Patel also bowled well. Owais Shah returned to continue his innings and reached 88 before being dismissed by Harbhajan Singh. He showed promise as a test player, and was confident enough to engage in dialogue with the Indian bowlers while compiling his innings. The most notable point was Shah visibly laughing having just lofted Harbhajan for a big six. England were eventually all out for 400.\nIndia's reply started with Virender Sehwag, Wasim Jaffer and Sachin Tendulkar all being dismissed cheaply to leave the hosts on 28/3. Tendulkar in particular was a concern for the Indians, taking a long time to score a solitary run and eventually being dismissed after facing 21 deliveries for that single. Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh engineered a recovery to finish the day on 89/3.\nOn day 3, England's bowlers continued despite finding the hot and humid conditions difficult. They eventually bowled India out for 279, with Geraint Jones taking 5 catches as wicketkeeper. James Anderson took 4 wickets in the innings, including the vital ones of Tendulkar and Dravid. The India total could have been much less were it not for a late order partnership between Anil Kumble and Sreesanth.\nEngland lost two wickets early in their second innings to close day 3 on 31/2. It was clear that the pitch was deteriorating fast, making Dravid's initial decision to field first even more unusual.\nDay 4 proved to be a day of traditional style Test cricket, with slow scoring rates achieved throughout. Barely 2 runs per over were managed, and England lost regular wickets as most batsmen struggled to adapt to the conditions. Andrew Flintoff scored 50, and Paul Collingwood and Owais Shah scored 32 and 38 respectively, which would prove to be important contributions.\nAndrew Flintoff had stressed to his batsmen before the match the importance of going on and making a big innings once a half century had been reached. He scored exactly 50 in both innings of this match.\nEngland were bowled out for 191 late in the day, and some commentators believed the opportunity for them to force a win had perhaps been lost. For the Indian bowlers, the spinners were the main performers, with Kumble and Harbhajan taking 6 wickets between them. India started their second innings needing 313 to win, a large target given the conditions of the pitch.\nThe final day started off with India on 18/1 (having lost Irfan Pathan late in the previous day) and the first session was seen out relatively safely, with only 2 wickets falling, one of those being that of the nightwatchman Kumble. Scoring was slow, and Dravid had faced over 50 deliveries for 9 runs by the lunch interval. Tendulkar had scored more freely, but overall the score at lunch was 75/3.\nThe next session was nothing short of remarkable, as the Indian batting order collapsed in a dramatic fashion. Dravid edged a ball from Flintoff to the wicketkeeper off the third delivery after the lunch break, and Tendulkar was caught at short leg off the bowling of Shaun Udal next over. The Indian batsmen struggled with Udal's bowling, who obtained significant help from the pitch, and he would go on to take 4 wickets in the second innings at a cost of just 14 runs.\nSehwag had been suffering from a back injury and was forced to bat at no 7. He was unable to cope with conditions and was dismissed for a duck by James Anderson. The next dismissal, that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was bizarre. Dhoni skied a ball off Udal, only for Monty Panesar to miss the chance as it landed around 10 feet from where he was, despite having ample time to position himself to take it. Unbelievably, Dhoni attempted a similar shot two balls later, and Panesar this time successfully held the chance. Some television commentators were actually confused by events believing the second shot by Dhoni to have been a replay of the original incident. Dhoni left the field to a chorus of boos by the crowd, stunned by England's strikes. At this point, the score was 92/7.\nHarbhajan Singh was dismissed next, attempting to slog sweep Udal for six, and Yuvraj Singh edged Flintoff into the slips. With the score on 99/9, the last man Munaf Patel managed a single to bring up the India 100, but he too then fell attempting to slog Udal out of the park. India were bowled out for 100, and had lost 7 wickets in 16 overs, for the addition of 25 runs. England won the match by 212 runs, and had levelled the series.\nEngland regarded the victory to be as great as reclaiming the Ashes, with winning in India always perceived to be a difficult task. It was considered even more incredible, given the loss of key players due to injuries prior to and during the series. India, on the other hand, came under extreme criticism for the loss and questions were asked of Dravid's decision to field first, as well as the batsmen's technique and application during the second innings when they collapsed from 75/3 to 100 all out.\nOverall, the test series had been competitive and demonstrated many opportunities of emerging talent on both sides which would hopefully benefit these two sides, as well as world cricket in general in the coming years.\nODI series.\nTour match vs. Rajasthan President's XI (25 March).\nRajasthan President's XI win by five runs\nRajasthan President's XI 260-6 (50 overs)\nEngland 255 (49.5 overs)\nNotes: England captain Andrew Flintoff was replaced as captain by Vikram Solanki, as he was at home visiting his newly born baby.\n2nd ODI.\nIn the first innings England batsmen Kevin Pietersen tied West Indian Viv Richards' record as the quickest to reach 1,000 runs in ODIs (21 innings). Suresh Raina, with his maiden ODI half-century, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni set a new record for the sixth wicket partnership for India in One-day Internationals.\nThe fall of the third wicket provided a talking point: Yuvraj Singh swept Ian Blackwell's delivery behind the stumps only for wicket keeper Geraint Jones to make a diving stop and throw the ball at the wicket, dislodging the leg stump and bail. With Singh still in his crease he was given not out, but Indian captain Rahul Dravid decided to take a quick run in the confusion as the ball ricocheted away; Paul Collingwood acted quickly though, and grabbed the ball and ran it into the remaining two stumps and bail just as Dravid made it to the crease. The TV umpire was called for the decision and after much deliberation Dravid was given out.\n5th ODI.\nThe game was washed out. Heavy rain poured in the day before, and the ground could not be dried sufficient enough for the game to start. Finally the game was called off by the Umpires' decisions without a ball being bowled due to a soggy outfield, an outcome that angered the fans who had been waiting for the game to start for five hours and they eventually started showing their frustration by hurling stones and setting fire to objects in the stands.\n6th ODI.\nTwenty-one-year-old V. R. V. Singh made his debut for India, who made a disastrous start to their innings, slipping to 76–5. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (96) and Ramesh Powar (54) lifted the home team to a more respectable total with a century stand for the sixth wicket. Harbhajan Singh was clean bowled by Kevin Pietersen for 4, although Harbhajan did not walk, waiting for the third umpire to be called in to adjudicate on the dismissal before finally swearing at Pietersen as he left the ground. Acting skipper Andrew Strauss (the third acting captain on this tour with Andrew Flintoff resting as 12th man) led England from the front with 74, before retiring hurt with cramp, and they strolled to victory with 43 balls to spare. Ian Blackwell hit a no-ball from Powar for six to reach the target.\n7th ODI.\nNote: Indian wicket keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni was replaced by Dinesh Karthik. English captain Andrew Flintoff was again replaced by Andrew Strauss.\nDebut of Robin Uthappa as the Indian opener saw him hit 12 fours and one six before being run out by Geraint Jones after James Anderson dived for a ball to stop a boundary and threw it back to the wicket keeper. The batsman, sharing a 166 partnership for the first wicket with skipper Rahul Dravid had all but won the match until he chanced a lazy second run; his score of 86 is the second highest for any Indian debutant in a limited overs match. With this win, India extended its world record of successive wins while batting second to 16."

        "text": "The Bohemia national ice hockey team was the national ice hockey team of the Kingdom of Bohemia, a kingdom within Austria-Hungary. The team competed between 1909 and 1914 playing in four European Championships. Playing its last game in 1914, the team was succeeded by the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team after the Kingdom of Bohemia was dissolved and became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic.\nHistory.\nBohemia played its first game in 1909 against France during the Chamonix Cup which was being held in Chamonix, France. Bohemia lost the game 1–8 and lost all of their three other games at the tournament against Belgium, England and Switzerland. During the tournament the team's 0–11 loss against England would be recorded as the team's largest ever loss in international participation. The following year Bohemia announced their intention to participate in the inaugural European Championships being held in Les Avants, Switzerland however withdrew due to a lack of training. In 1911, Bohemia participated in the 1911 European Championship being held in Berlin, German Empire. Bohemia won the tournament after winning all three of their games and finishing on top of the standings. During the tournament, they also achieved their largest ever win in international participation when they beat Switzerland 13–0. The following year Bohemia, this time being represented by the club team HC Slavia Praha, again won gold at the European Championships however the tournament was annulled by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG) congress due to Austria not being affiliated with the LIHG at the time of the tournament. During the 1913 European Championship, Bohemia finished second behind Belgium who won their first title. In 1914, Bohemia competed in an exhibition game against Germany in Montreux, Switzerland. Germany won the game 4–2 and recorded their first and only win over Bohemia. A month later, Bohemia competed in their last European Championship. Being represented again by HC Slavia Praha, Bohemia went on to win their third Championship in four years after winning both of their games and finishing on top the standings.\nAfter playing their last game in 1914, the Bohemian national team was succeeded by the Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team after the Kingdom of Bohemia was dissolved and became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic\nNotes.\n Result was annulled due to Austria not being a member of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace at the time."

        "title": "Volleyball in the United States",
        "text": " \nVolleyball is a popular sport in the United States with both male and female participants of all ages. Almost all high schools and colleges in the United States have female volleyball teams, and most regions of the country have developmental programs for girls of all ages as well. While many areas of the country are forming male teams and development programs, there are still fewer opportunities for young male athletes to play volleyball in the United States than for young female athletes. Men's volleyball is a fast-growing sport among high schools, with 36 states having male volleyball programs (though in several of these states, it is organized as a club sport and not sanctioned by the state's high school governing body). Most men's seasons are in the spring while women's seasons take place primarily in the fall; however, there are a few men's teams such as in Wisconsin, Virginia, and New York who play in the fall as well.\nNational teams.\nThe United States men's national volleyball team has won three gold medals at the 1984, 1988, and 2008 Olympic Games, the 1986 FIVB World Championship, the 1985 and 2015 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Cup, and the 2014 FIVB World League.\nMeanwhile, the United States women's national volleyball team has won the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, the 2014 FIVB World Championship, six editions of the FIVB World Grand Prix, and the 2018, 2019 and 2021 FIVB Nations League. Also, they finished second at the 1984, 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, the 1967 and 2002 FIVB World Championship, the 2005 and 2013 FIVB World Grand Champions, and the 2011 and 2019 FIVB World Cup\nProfessional volleyball.\nAs a professional sport, volleyball has had limited success in the United States. International Volleyball Association was a co-ed professional league that existed from 1975 to 1980. Numerous attempts have been made to start professional indoor women's volleyball leagues. Major League Volleyball was a women's league with six teams that played for two-and-a-half seasons from 1987 to 1989 with games shown on ESPN on tape delay; it folded mid-season in 1989, however, due to financial losses. USA Volleyball Cup is an annual indoor volleyball championship. Two-man and two-woman professional beach volleyball leagues have done better, most notably the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP), but none have gained a wide following that would get them consistent coverage by the major television networks. In 2002, United States Professional Volleyball League was begun as a women's professional indoor league, but only lasted one season. In 2004 and again in 2005, NBC aired the Nissan Championship series, with Fox Sports carrying the majority of the season.\nThere has been a large push within the volleyball community to provide professional outlets for developing athletes. As of 2019 there are currently two leagues that branch across the United States. First of these is the National Volleyball Association (NVA) founded in 2017. The NVA currently has 12 teams. The second league is the Volleyball League Of America (VLA) founded in 2019 and has 8 men's Tier 1 teams, 32 men's Tier 2 teams and 8 women's teams spread across the United States.\nAthletes Unlimited Volleyball (AUV) is a women's professional indoor volleyball league in the US, founded in 2021. Pro Volleyball Federation is scheduled to start in 2024.\nLiga de Voleibol Superior Masculino and Liga de Voleibol Superior Femenino are professional volleyball leagues in Puerto Rico.\nNVA teams:\nVLA Tier 1 teams:\nPremier Volleyball League.\nA new indoor professional league, the Premier Volleyball League (sanctioned by USA Volleyball), began in 2012 with a women's division. In 2013 the PVL incorporated and launched a men's division. The PVL was discontinued in 2017.\nCollege volleyball.\nVolleyball is a popular NCAA sport, mostly for women. In the 2013-14 school year, 1064 NCAA member schools, 329 of them in the top-level Division I, sponsored women's volleyball at the varsity level, with 16,647 participants across all three divisions. At the same time, 109 schools in all three NCAA divisions combined sponsored varsity men's volleyball, with only 23 of them in Division I; the number of men's varsity volleyball players was roughly one-tenth of women's participation (1,720 to 16,647).\nMen's volleyball experienced explosive growth at the Division III level in the 2010s and early 2020s. In the 2010 season (2009–10 school year), only 13 Division III schools competed within the NCAA, although many other D-III members competed outside the NCAA. The next season saw 56 teams play under D-III regulations, leading the NCAA to establish a separate Division III championship in 2012. In that season, 63 teams played D-III men's volleyball, with the number increasing to 113 by the 2022 season.\nIn 2012, NCAA sanctioned college beach volleyball teams for women for the first time; 14 schools sponsored the sport, with slightly more than 200 participants. The NCAA held its first beach volleyball championship in 2016, by which time nearly 50 schools were sponsoring the sport. In the 2022 season (2021–22 school year), 85 schools were sponsoring the sport.\nHigh school volleyball.\nHigh school volleyball is a fall sport for girls and spring sport for boys (except in a few states). Schools typically have a varsity and junior varsity team, and some schools also have freshman teams. Teams play in pre-season and season competition, generally followed by a post-season that includes a regional or sectional championship and often a state championship.\nWhile each state governs its own high school volleyball competitions through their state athletic associations, most follow the lead of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) for the governance of the sport. Most volleyball rules from state to state are basically the same in the United States. However, because of the individual associations, some minor changes and variations may occur. For example, the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) may allow competition to be the best of five while the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) or the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission (WVSSAC) may only allow competition to be the best of three. Today, however, most state associations are now using the same guidelines and are also using rally scoring, the best-of-five competition format, and allowing the \"libero\" to serve. In addition, most states, if not all, have adopted the plain, white polo shirt for officials as opposed to the black and white striped shirt worn in the past.\nJunior volleyball.\nJunior volleyball is played in the U.S. in many organizations such as churches, the YMCA and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), but the largest sponsoring organization is USA Volleyball, which oversees what is commonly referred to as \"club volleyball\" and hosts a Junior Olympic Championship each year.\nIn club volleyball, junior players develop their skills and knowledge of the game, usually with the purpose of playing for high school teams. Elite players also prepare for college volleyball. The club season typically lasts from the end of November until July, with the annual Junior Olympic Championships (JOs) taking place in late June, early July. Teams typically play tournaments throughout the season, establishing their ranking in the various regions and preparing for JOs or a season-ending tournament such as the Volleyball Festival, which claims to be the largest annual sporting event in the world.\nTo qualify for JOs, teams must compete in JO Qualifiers, also referred to as National Qualifiers. There are nine qualifying tournaments across the country, to which teams travel to gain an invitation to JOs. Top teams attend these tournaments to earn their bids, and college coaches will attend to view the year's crop of players.\nThe club season, long considered a supplemental place for girls and boys to gain experience in preparation for their upcoming high-school seasons, is now an almost necessity to stay competitive in the local high schools. It is also extremely important in the college recruitment process, as most college seasons coincide with state high school seasons, causing the college coaches to miss the entire season. This time is made up during the club season when college coaches are able to travel to various tournaments and meet with club coaches, watch club players, and recruit for their teams.\nToday.\nVolleyball is one of the most popular girls' sports, and strong high school and club programs are found throughout the country. According to a 2022 survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations, volleyball is the second highest sport for female participation at the high school level, trailing outdoor track and field by fewer than 3,000 participants. One of the biggest events in high school-age sports is the annual Volleyball Festival in Phoenix, Arizona, (formerly in Reno, Nevada until 2009 and Sacramento, California until 2004), which draws as many as 10,000 players and 3,000 coaches for its five-day tournament.\nBoys' volleyball is popular on a regional basis, and by far the greatest number of boys' teams are in Southern California. However, on the national stage, boys' volleyball remains far less popular than the girls' game at the high school level, as borne out by the following statistics from the aforementioned 2022 NFHS survey:\nIn the four years from 2004 to 2008, high school participation in boys' volleyball rose by more than 15%, from about 42,000 to nearly 50,000. Boys' volleyball has experienced noticeable growth in the 2010s and 2020s, coinciding with the relative boom in NCAA Division III men's volleyball; in 2021–22, roughly 66,500 boys were reported to be playing officially sanctioned high school volleyball. This does not include boys playing at club level in states where high school competition is not officially sanctioned.\nReferences.\nhttps://volleyballleagueofamerica.com/standings\nExternal links.\nNational Governing Body\nCollegiate\nBeach\nHigh School\nJuniors\nProfessional\nOther"

        "title": "Yan Zi (tennis)",
        "text": "Yan Zi (; born 12 November 1984) is a retired Chinese-Hong Kong tennis player.\nCareer summary.\nIn 2005, at the age of 20, Yan Zi won her only WTA Tour singles title at the Guangzhou International Open.\nIn singles, she first reached the world top 100 in January 2006, achieving a then career-high of world No. 72 that March before failing to defend her breakthrough run of results the previous year and dropping back outside the top 100 that October. Her ranking had slumped to 262 by February 2007 after a year of disappointing results, but her results then picked up again over the rest of 2007; and she regained the top 100 for the first time in ten months after a spectacular run at the Tier I Canada Masters in August, reaching the semifinals before finally being defeated by world No. 1, Justine Henin, in straight sets.\nIn doubles, her highest ranking is No. 4; she won two Grand Slam titles, partnering with Zheng Jie. While she has been good at doubles, her singles performance has been inconsistent as her form fluctuated. She has winning records against top-10 stars Jelena Janković 2–0, Ana Ivanovic 1–0, and Marion Bartoli 1–0.\nIn 2014, Yan received Hong Kong citizenship. In April 2016, she became captain of the Hong Kong Fed Cup team. Later that year, she announced her retirement.\nSingles career in detail.\n2002–2003.\nUntil January 2002, Yan met with mixed results as a singles player in the lower reaches of the ITF tournament hierarchy. But that month, she reached the final of a $10k event at Hull, losing to Liu Nannan. In May, she avenged this defeat with a win over Liu in the first round of a $50k at Fukuoka; and again in August she defeated Liu, this time in the quarterfinal of a $25k tournament at Beijing, only to lose to Rika Fujiwara in the semifinal. In September, she qualified for the WTA Tour contest at Shanghai, only to lose in the first round. However, she had reached numerous ITF Circuit quarterfinals during the year, and finished it ranked for the first time inside the world top 300, at No. 299.\nIn February 2003, she narrowly failed to qualify at Hyderabad, losing to Maria Kirilenko in a tight three-set match in the final round of qualifying. She put in her career-best performance to date at Fukuoka, reaching the semifinal with wins over Rika Fujiwara and Sun Tiantian, before losing to Saori Obata despite winning more games, the scoreline standing at 6–2, 6–7, 5–7. In July, she qualified for a WTA event at Palermo by defeating Zheng Jie and Ivana Abramović, then fell in the main-draw first round to Italian rising star Francesca Schiavone in another three-setter in which she won more games than her victorious opponent, the scoreline this time being 6–0, 4–6, 3–6. These defeats suggest that she quickly runs out of steam after giving it all in the first set, thereby allowing her opponent to regroup and eventually pocket the contest. The same week, she defeated Sun Tiantian to qualify for a $50k event at Modena, and in the main draw ousted Yulia Beygelzimer and Adriana Serra Zanetti en route to a quarterfinal loss. In September, she qualified for another WTA event, the Japan Open, and defeated Ashley Harkleroad in round two before losing, on this occasion, to Zheng Jie in the quarterfinals. In December, she reached the semifinal of a $50k tournament for the second time in the year, beating Tzipora Obziler in the quarterfinal at Changsha before losing to another of her prominent countrywomen, Peng Shuai. The following week, she narrowly lost in the quarterfinal of the $50k contest at Shenzhen to future star Sesil Karatantcheva, in three sets. The year had brought great improvement to Yan's singles results, and her year-end ranking correspondingly improved to 179.\n2004.\nUnfortunately, 2004 set back her progress slightly. The year began poorly for her with a string of early losses, although she was ambitiously targeting only WTA Tour events now, raising the bar on the required standard for successful competition. She failed to win a first-round main draw match the entire year, meeting only with moderate success in qualifying rounds; and ultimately the only relief she could find towards salvaging her world ranking was a retreat to ITF Circuit late in the year. She reached the semifinal of a $25k tournament at Beijing in September (losing again to Zheng Jie), and the same stage at Shenzhen (where she shocked Li Na in the quarterfinals, then lost yet again to Zheng). This late flourish of results was enough to limp her home to a year-end ranking of 248.\n2005.\nIn January 2005, Yan battled her way past three high-quality opponents, Julia Schruff, Shikha Uberoi and Melinda Czink, to qualify for Tennis Gold Coast, an important WTA event, where she was removed by Tatiana Golovin of France. Then in May, she managed to beat Uberoi again after qualifying for Rabat with a win over Sun Tiantian, only to lose to Arantxa Parra Santonja in the second round. Then in June, she surpassed her previous career-best result, reaching the final of a $50k tournament at Beijing with wins over Sun and Zheng, but lost in the final to less-feted countrywoman Li Ting. The following month, as a direct entrant to the WTA event at Modena, she defeated the much higher-ranked Marta Domachowska of Poland before losing a close three-setter to Sanda Mamić. In September, she avenged her defeat by Li Ting to qualify for Bali, only to succumb to her former doubles partner Li Na in round two of the main draw.\nIn September 2005, she began competing in the WTA event at Guangzhou, this year upgraded to Tier III status, and shocked herself by proceeding to \"win the entire tournament\", having previously \"failed to win even one ITF singles title\", and having only once reached the quarter-final stage at any WTA Tour event. To achieve this astonishing outcome, she had to produce some of her best tennis to conquer defending champion Li Na in the quarterfinal, which she finally won 6–7, 7–5, 7–6, after an intense battle. The other matches against worthy opposition looked easy by comparison, as she crushed Marta Domachowska for the loss of just three games in round two, fought past impressive emerging teen star Victoria Azarenka in the semifinal, and was up 6–4, 4–0 against Nuria Llagostera Vives in the final when the Spaniard conceded victory.\nA semifinal result in November's $50k Shenzhen tournament capped off what had proved to be a superlative year for Yan, leaving her world-ranked 104, within the direct-entry threshold of Grand Slam events and minor WTA tournaments, and within the qualifying-entry threshold of even the more exclusive WTA fixtures.\n2006.\nShe began the season by narrowly failing to qualify for Tennis Gold Coast, despite wins over Vania King and Shikha Uberoi, as Angela Haynes defeated her in three sets. But she succeeded in qualifying for Sydney with stunning straight-sets victories over Eva Birnerová, Denisa Chládková and Anastasia Yakimova, and beat the high-ranked Anna Chakvetadze in two sets in the main-draw first round before losing a three-set match to Francesca Schiavone, who had to struggle through a nail-bitingly close second-set tiebreak to avoid a straight sets loss to Yan, only to win the final set by a more comfortable margin.\nAs if these scores were not enough to prove her capability to the wider world, at the Australian Open she knocked out former No. 15 and the previous year's semifinalist, Nathalie Dechy of France, in the first round, she then defeated unseeded Aleksandra Wozniak, before suffering to former No. 19, Sybille Bammer. February brought more disappointing results in singles for Yan, as she lost a three-setter to Emma Laine of Finland at Pattaya, and failed to qualify for Doha and Dubai. But still, her January results and some points picked up in qualifying rounds in February had improved her world ranking to No. 66, just one place behind Li Na.\n2007.\nAt the second round of the Canadian Open in Toronto, she upset world No. 4, Ana Ivanovic, with a score of 6–3, 6–1 in just over an hour, even as Ivanovic had a rare off day. She then beat Eleni Daniilidou in the third round and 2007's Wimbledon's finalist Marion Bartoli (who retired while trailing 2–6, 0–3) in the quarterfinals. Yan's run was ended in the semifinals by world No. 1, Justine Henin, who showed the door through a straight-sets win over her.\n2008.\nYan started 2008 poorly, with a first-round loss at the Australian Open to eventual quarterfinalist Venus Williams. However, at the Bangalore Open she upset Maria Kirilenko saving three match points. Afterwards she managed to upset Jelena Janković in a quarterfinal, winning 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, however Janković did struggle with a shoulder injury. She eventually lost to runner-up Patty Schnyder in straight sets and made her top-50 debut afterwards at No. 43.\nAt the Summer Olympics, Yan and her partner Zheng Jie won the women's doubles bronze medal, defeating the Ukrainian duo of Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko in the bronze medal match.\n2009.\nIn January, Yan played qualifying singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles at the Australian Open. In qualifying singles, she was seeded eighth but lost to unseeded Alexandra Panova in the qualifying second round. In women's doubles, she partnered with Zheng Jie and was seeded sixth and lost in the third round. In mixed doubles, she partnered with Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and was seeded second and lost in the second round. Because of playing doubles extensively her singles ranking has dropped to where it is hard for her to get into events. She has started playing doubles with Chuang Chia-jung, now because she wants to get out of Zheng's shadow. The choice was more so, though, because she wants to improve her singles ranking."

        "text": "James Staton \"Country\" King (born February 7, 1941) is an American retired professional basketball player and former college coach.\nA 6'2\" guard from the University of Tulsa, King was selected by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the 1963 NBA draft. King played 10 NBA seasons (1963–1973) with four teams: the Lakers, the San Francisco Warriors, the Cincinnati Royals, and the Chicago Bulls. He represented the Warriors in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game, and he retired with 4,377 career points.\nKing later coached the Tulsa Golden Hurricane from 1975 to midway through the 1979–1980 season, when he resigned after seasons. The school retired his jersey number 24, and in 1984, he was inducted into the University of Tulsa Hall of Fame.\nNBA career.\nIn Los Angeles, King played much of his first three seasons behind former UCLA teammates Gail Goodrich and Walt Hazzard, after which the Lakers left him unprotected in the expansion draft. No sooner were he and Jeff Mullins claimed by Chicago on May 1, 1966, than they were traded to San Francisco in return for All-Star guard Guy Rodgers. The move proved to be a fortuitous one for both players, as they were instrumental in the Warriors' drive to the 1966–67 Western Division title. On April 18, 1967, King (28 points) and superstar teammate Rick Barry (55) combined for 83 points in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, a 130–124 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers. Only the Lakers tandem of Elgin Baylor (61) and Jerry West (26) had scored more in a championship series game.\nKing was even better in the 1967–68 season, when he emerged as one of the best combo guards in the league. Despite the absence of Barry, who had jumped to the rival ABA in the off-season, the Warriors picked up where they left off, only this time with King in a lead role. In his first 15 games, he ranked among the NBA scoring leaders at 24.2 points per game. He also averaged 4.9 assists and 4.7 rebounds in that span. King suffered a knee injury a short time later, however, which would reduce his effectiveness thereafter. Nonetheless, he was selected to play with the West team in the 1968 All-Star Game in New York. In a 144-124 loss, he had four points and two assists off the bench.\nPrior to the 1969–70 campaign, King and Bill Turner were traded to the Cincinnati Royals in return for Jerry Lucas, but he saw action in only 31 games because of knee issues. He signed with Chicago one year later and played his final three seasons off the bench there."

        "title": "Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970)",
        "text": "Michael Burton Brown (born March 5, 1970) is an American basketball coach who is the head coach for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Brown was previously the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and most recently an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors. He is also the head coach of the Nigerian national team. Brown began coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005. The team reached the 2007 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Brown was honored as NBA Coach of the Year for leading the Cavaliers to a team-record and league-best 66 wins in 2009. The Cavaliers won 61 games, again a league-best, in 2010. However, after the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals, Brown was fired. Brown succeeded Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011 before being dismissed five games into the 2012–13 season. He returned to the Cavaliers in 2013, but was fired after one season. Brown then joined the Golden State Warriors as associate head coach in 2016; the team went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, and the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. He departed from the Warriors in 2022 to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings. In his first year as head coach, Brown led the Kings to their first playoff appearance in 17 years, snapping the longest playoff drought in NBA history. For his efforts, Brown became the first-ever unanimous NBA Coach of the Year award winner and was named to the NBCA Coach of the Year award in 2023.\nEarly years.\nBrown was born on March 5, 1970, in Columbus, Ohio, to a father who served in the US Air Force. He moved with his family to military bases where his father was stationed and spent time in the United States, Japan and Germany during his childhood. Brown graduated in 1988 from Würzburg American High School in Würzburg, Germany, where he excelled in basketball and football.\nCollege career.\nAfter studying and playing basketball for two years at Mesa Community College, Brown went on to the University of San Diego, where he played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego Toreros and graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.\nDenver Nuggets.\nBrown began his NBA career in 1992 with the Denver Nuggets, where he was a video coordinator and scout for five seasons.\nCoaching career.\nWashington Wizards (1997–1999).\nIn 1997, Brown moved to Washington for two seasons, working as an assistant coach under Bernie Bickerstaff.\nSan Antonio Spurs (2000–2003).\nIn 2000, Brown was hired by Gregg Popovich as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs. He also was the head coach for the Spurs' summer league teams in Boston and Salt Lake City. The Spurs won an NBA championship in 2003 while Brown was on their coaching staff.\nIndiana Pacers (2003–2005).\nIn 2003, Brown was hired as associate head coach under Rick Carlisle with the Indiana Pacers. He helped lead Indiana to consecutive playoff appearances, including a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2004. Brown followed Ron Artest into the stands and was instrumental in getting him back to the locker room during the massive brawl between the Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and Pistons fans at the Palace at Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004. Brown remained with the Pacers for two seasons.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2005–2010).\nIn June 2005, Brown replaced Brendan Malone as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was his first NBA head coaching position. Brown became the second-youngest coach in the league (trailing only Lawrence Frank). When Brown arrived in Cleveland, the Cavs had missed the playoffs in emerging superstar LeBron James's first two NBA seasons and had not made the playoffs since 1998. Under Brown, they won 50 games, made the 2005–06 playoffs, and won their first-round series.\nOn June 2, 2007, Brown's Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. However, they were swept in four games by his former team, the San Antonio Spurs.\nOn February 1, 2008, Brown was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January 2008. In 2009, Brown was named coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team. On April 20, 2009, Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year after guiding the Cavaliers to a league-high and franchise-best 66–16 record.\nThe Cavs won a league-high 61 games in the 2009–10 season. However, the team was eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals on May 13, 2010. With this loss, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to win 60 games in back-to-back seasons without advancing to the NBA Finals. Brown was fired on May 24, 2010, due to the owner Dan Gilbert wanting to lure LeBron James back to Cleveland. Under Brown's leadership, the Cavs made it past the first round of the NBA playoffs for five consecutive seasons.\nLos Angeles Lakers (2011–2012).\nOn May 25, 2011, Brown agreed to succeed Phil Jackson as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He reportedly agreed to a three-year deal with a team option to renew his contract for a fourth year. On May 31, 2011, he was officially named the Lakers' new head coach. The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games by the lockout that season, and the Lakers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.\nBefore the 2012–13 season, Brown decided that the Lakers would use a version of the Princeton offense. Shortly afterward, the Lakers acquired All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, giving them a starting lineup of five former All-Stars with a combined 33 All-Star game appearances (the other former All-Stars were Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace, respectively). Although immediately considered top title contenders, the Lakers struggled to adjust to the changes in both system and personnel and were winless in eight preseason games. The team's travails continued into the start of the regular season, with the team losing four of its first five games. Nash had played just games due to injury, Howard was playing but recovering from back surgery, and Bryant had been playing with an injured foot and was unable to practice. On November 9, 2012, Brown was fired. The Lakers felt an urgency to win given their aging stars, Howard's pending free agency, and owner Jerry Buss's deteriorating health. Brown's dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history.\nSecond stint with Cleveland Cavaliers (2013–2014).\nOn April 24, 2013, Brown was rehired by the Cavaliers, replacing Byron Scott as head coach. Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said that firing Brown the first time was a \"mistake\". For the first time as a head coach, Brown's team posted a losing record over an 82-game season as his team was marred by injuries and reported infighting in the locker room. On May 12, 2014, he was fired by Gilbert a second time.\nGolden State Warriors (2016–2022).\nOn July 6, 2016, the Golden State Warriors hired Brown as an assistant coach; he replaced Luke Walton, who departed for a head coaching position with the Los Angeles Lakers. Brown acted as acting head coach during periods in which head coach Steve Kerr was unable to do so due to chronic back pain. Brown led the Warriors to a 12–0 record in the 2016–17 NBA playoffs while Kerr was absent; the Warriors went on to win the championship in five games that year, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history. The Warriors went back to the Finals in 2018 and defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals for the second straight year. During these two finals he faced off against LeBron James, whom he had coached for five years in Cleveland.\nOn May 9, 2022, he was the Warriors' acting head coach for Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies after Kerr tested positive for COVID-19. The team won the game to take a 3–1 lead in the series. The Warriors made it to the 2022 NBA Finals where they defeated the Boston Celtics in six games to give Brown his fourth NBA championship as an assistant coach and third championship with the Warriors overall.\nSacramento Kings (2022–present).\nOn May 9, 2022, Brown was named the head coach of the Sacramento Kings. In his inaugural season, he coached the Kings to a 48–34 record and the team's first playoff appearance since 2006. In 2023, Brown was named NBA Coach of the year, receiving 100 votes and becoming the first coach in history to win the award by a unanimous vote.\nNational team career.\nOn February 5, 2020, Brown was announced as the new head coach of Nigeria's men's national basketball team."

        "title": "Sunnybank Rugby",
        "text": "Sunnybank Rugby Union Club is an Australian rugby union club based in the Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank, Queensland, currently competing in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition. It was established in 1969 and has won three premierships since it entered. \nHistory.\nSunnybank Rugby Union Club was founded in 1969 as a junior rugby union club, in the southern Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank. As a junior club, it was founded on the principle that any boy, no matter how good or bad a rugby player he was, would get a game. And so it remains in the ranks of the junior players at Sunnybank, however the word \"boy\" has been changed to \"child\".\nIn its first year, the club fielded an Under 8s team coached by Bill Horsley and an Under 11s side coached by Graeme Page. The club played their home games at Sunnybank State High School, until 1974, when the club moved to its present home ground of Biggs Field in the nearby Brisbane suburb of Macgregor. The Sunnybank High School colours of black, green and white were adopted and the Chinese dragon adopted as the emblem of the new club.\nThe Dragons went from strength to strength, consistently being one of the strongest clubs in the Queensland Junior Rugby Union competition. The high point of this was claiming the President's Trophy for champion junior club in 1980.\nIn 1975, Sunnybank expanded from being solely a junior club, to being one with more senior players, with the introduction of an Under 19s side in that year. The club then proceeded to field its first Senior team in 1979, with a team playing in the Sub-Districts competition coached by former Souths Magpies prop David McNiven.\nThe club was finally promoted to First Grade status in 1989. Sunnybank had only to wait until 1993 before it made its first appearance in a First Grade Grand Final. The game was lost to Souths, but it signalled a dramatic change in the club's fortunes. Another First Grade Grand Final berth was secured the following year, but again they went down. However, in these two years, Sunnybank produced more than its fair share of representative players, especially in the Australian Under 19s side and the Australian Under 21s side. The mid-1990s saw a drop in Sunnybank's fortunes, with a large exodus of talented players.\nComing of age.\nHowever, the new millennium brought another high in Sunnybank's story. A major coup for SBRU was the signing of England Sevens Star Ben Gollings. In 2005, the Sunnybank First Grade team defeated the Gold Coast Breakers in the Hospital's Cup Grand Final, to claim the club's first senior top division championship. This performance was repeated in 2007, when once again the Dragons defeated the Breakers in the Premier Grade Grand Final at Ballymore, the spiritual home of Queensland Rugby. 2006 saw the opening of a new main oval and the opening of a new club house. Also the Premier grade team was knocked out in the semi-finals after losing their two props to wallaby commitments.\nThe 2007 season got off to a steady start with wingers Liam Bibo and Karel Bos impressing as with fullback and captain John Dart, towards the end the development of young fly-half Ben Lucas and the return of QLD Reds player Digby Ioanie, Rodney Blake, Greg Holmes, Henari Veratau and Nic Berry saw the Dragons develop impressive form in the lead up to the finals, culminating in an impressive 85–19 Grand Final victory over the Gold Coast, with Ben Lucas hauling a personal tally of 35 points. The club's players were also available for selection to the Australian Rugby Championship franchise East Coast Aces in 2007.\nHonours.\nQueensland Premier Rugby – Premiers: (3) 2005, 2007, 2011\nQueensland Premier Rugby – Runners-up: (4) 1993, 1994, 2012, 2014 \nAustralian Club Championship – Runners-up: (1) 2008"

It is also affiliated with the Ursuline High School, the college's sister school, who have worked in partnership since 1986.\nHistory.\nEarly beginnings.\nThe school was founded on 18 January 1892, initially at the site of No. 3 Cranbrook Road. On its first day, only one student, Thomas Lloyd, was in attendance; his brother William had fallen ill. After the first academic year, six more students joined the Lloyd brothers. During this period the school moved twice, first to a property on Darlaston Road and then to a building adjoining the All England Lawn Tennis Courts. Finally, in 1893. the college acquired the former site of Wimbledon School on Edge Hill, aided by the financial backing of Edith Arendrup. Lessons began at this site on 26 June 1893; the college has not moved since.\nIn September 1898, the Wimbledon College Army Department was established, which trained young men for entrance into the Royal Military Academies at Sandhurst and Woolwich.\nDuring the First World War, the college lost 129 former pupils, including Maurice Dease and Gerald Robert O'Sullivan, both of whom received the Victoria Cross. On 18 February 1922, the war memorial at the rear of the chapel and the memorial stained glass window at the front, behind the altar, were unveiled.\nIn 1921, John Manning, the prefect of studies, which was then the formal title for the college's head master, introduced the house system with three houses (Fisher, More, and Campion), leading to an expansion of extracurricular activities. This was complemented with the development of a senior prefect system, with six boys managing the day-to-day discipline of the school. In 1929, eight acres of field beside Coombe Lane, in Raynes Park, was bought as a venue for the college's sporting activities; it has been in use for these purposes ever since.\nIn 1933, due to the growing number of pupils, the decision was made to buy Donhead Lodge, across the road from the college on Edge Hill, and establish a preparatory school there. The seventy-two pupils from Lower Preparatory, Preparatory, and Elements were taken from the college and settled at the newly instituted Wimbledon College Preparatory School (now Donhead).\nUnder Sinnott.\nJohn Sinnott was inaugurated as the prefect of studies in 1937; he was the first former student of the college to hold that office. Sinnott is widely seen as having pioneered the college and wider Catholic education in Britain during his thirteen years as prefect of studies, over which time he developed a careers bureau, a college orchestra, academic interhouse competitions and violin playing. Acting on concerns of fire hazards due to crowded corridors and underfunded laboratories in a 1938 inspection, and on the appetite from inspectors for his plans to expand the provision of geography lessons, Sinnott made plans to expand the college with new facilities; however, he was frustrated by the outbreak of the World War II, when tight restrictions were placed on the use of steel and timber.\nDuring the Second World War, the functioning of the college was much more disrupted than in World War I. The college and Donhead both had cellars which, with minor adjustments, were approved by local air raid wardens. Sandbags were brought in and timber frames used to reinforce the ceilings. Since both schools were outside the evacuation area, school was allowed to proceed. Three weeks after the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, the new school term began, albeit with a drop in attendance of one in five pupils. Because the games pitch was distant from the bomb shelters, games lessons were cancelled during the war and break was shortened. The college's swimming pool provided valuable water for the local fire brigade and, in the local community, the school acted as a first aid centre.\nOn the night of 18 February 1944, a bomb exploded on the Convent of the Sisters of Mary, situated on the Downs, a nearby road, killing five nuns and wounding several others. Windows and doors in the college were damaged and the roof of its swimming pool caved in; the pool was never recommissioned at that site due to the damage incurred.\nThe college lost fifty-eight former pupils as a result of the Second World War, including Eugene Esmonde, a recipient of the Victoria Cross. They are commemorated by a memorial above the door of the college's chapel.\nSeparately, during this time, Sinnott had concluded that the independent school model was not suitable, owing to the unaffordable fees required of Catholic families; in January 1942, he applied to Surrey County Council (in whose jurisdiction Wimbledon resided at the time) for deficiency aided school status, and this was granted in 1943. This allowed the college to be funded by the local education authority while retaining its religious character. Fees were abolished in March 1945. This marked the beginning of the process of the college becoming a voluntary aided grammar school, which was completed in July 1948.\nIn 1945, Richard Milward, a former pupil at the school, began a 40-year tenure as a history teacher (and later as the history master) at the college. A popular teacher and local historian, and president of the Wimbledon Society for six years, he was seen as a stalwart of the school.\nSinnott died in his early 50s and was replaced as prefect of studies by Ignatius St Lawrence in 1950.\nPost-1950.\nThe school expanded its facilities with a new wing (the St Lawrence wing) of classrooms, kitchens and toilets completed in the early 1950s; these are now predominantly used for English and science. The growth in demand for student places meant that the school quickly expanded, from nearly 500 pupils in 1950, to 670 by the mid-1960s. In order to accommodate all students, it began to use the parish halls of the next-door Sacred Heart Church, for lessons and study spaces, and facilities in Chessington owned by the Old Wimbledonians Association. Between 1965 and 1967, the school constructed a new cross-wing, the Manners wing, which housed the sixth form, new classrooms, a gymnasium and a swimming pool; the Manners wing now houses maths and sciences.\nIn 1968, the school successfully revived its houses tradition, which had fallen into irrelevance to many boys, and prefects resumed their function as the main guarantors of discipline. A dual house and line system, as operates today, was established. The following year, the college became a voluntary aided comprehensive school.\nIn the early morning of 13 February 1977, the college hall was destroyed by fire; the cause of the fire is still undetermined. The school's administration was not displeased, as a plan had been formulated for several years to build a new hall on the site of the old one; this plan was executed in 1980 in the aftermath of the fire. The new hall continued to house the college's kitchens and dinery.\nDuring the 1980s, the school ehanced its reputation as a strong rugby and cricket school with a series of notable successes. Paddy O'D (Donhead Lodge Prep School) and Gerald Smythe (St Catherines Middle School) had built an incredibly strong sporting base which fed pupils into the Wimbledon College system. Notable players from this time were numerous and many went on to represent Surrey Schools as well as England Schools and a number went on to play first class rugby both in England and abroad (notably Brian Mullin of London Irish and Clermont, John Travers Rosslyn Park, Fergus Timmons Rosslyn Park and Cambridge, James Dyson Richmond, Brian Gegg Harlequins and Cambridge and Ben Ryan Cambridge, West Hartlepool, coach of England sevens 2007-13, Fiji sevens 2013-16 winning Olympic gold in 2016. Other notable players of this era were Ivan Stroud (Surrey rugby, cricket and Rosslyn Park), Michael Nielsen (Rosslyn Park and Surrey), Steve Porter (Surrey and Harlequins) and Billy McCulloch (Surrey and Rosslyn Park) There was subsequently great success in the Surrey Rugby Championship. This also saw a golden period for the Old Wimbledonians rugby club with 5 teams turning out each week on a regular basis. The practice of using the ferula for punishment, as was common in Jesuit schools, was abandoned around 1989 in line with the governments banning of corpral punishment \nFrom the 1990s, the school replaced its forty-minute, eight-period day with a one-hour, five-period day and then its present fifty-minute, six-period day. Initially, lessons on Friday finished after the fourth period at the school in order to encourage extracurricular activities; this practice of early finishes on Fridays remains the standard at the Ursuline High School, but was removed from the college in the 2000s. In 1996, annual prizegiving assemblies returned, having ended in 1973.\nUnder Michael Holman, the school rapidly expanded its facilities. In May 2002, the school opened its new sports facilities, known as the Arrupe Hall, which include a large sports hall that also serves as the exam hall and a new swimming pool. At around the same time, the Milward Centre was open; it is the present-day sixth form centre. Both the Arrupe Hall and the Milward Centre were opened over the old gymnasium and swimming pool. In 2003, a new refectory opened over the site of former lavatories. The school acquired the grounds of the former St. Catherine's School on Grand Drive, in Morden, which was renamed the Campion Centre and taught Figures and Rudiments; the grounds on Edge Hill had become known as the Loyola Centre.\nUnder the headmastership of Adrian Porter, in July 2005, the school opened its George Malcolm Music School. Figures and Rudiments boys returned to the main site in 2005, with the Campion Centre abandoned. The period was marked with an expansion in extracurricular activities, especially drama, with the school's student magazine, \"The Wimbledonian\", becoming a student-run publication for a brief period until 2010. The school was modernised with personal computers and new furniture and it briefly extended its joined sixth form with the Ursuline High School to Richard Challoner and Holy Cross in Malden Manor and New Malden respectively; this was ended due to the large distances involved.\nIn 2011, Adrian Laing became the first lay head master of the school. As in 1968 under Robert Carty, attempts were made at reviving the house system, which had again fallen into irrelevance, with the creation of four new houses in 2011 so that the forms system could merge with the house system. Interhouse competitions and prefect-led house assemblies were restored. Discipline has been considerably emphasised since 2011, with increased security measures, electronic staff passes and registers, and policies targeted at improving attendance, punctuality, homework completion rates and the orderliness of pupils.\nOn 2 March 2020, the school was closed for at least a week for deep-cleaning after a member of staff contracted the COVID-19 virus on a trip to Italy.\nOrganisation.\nThe students of Wimbledon College are organised administratively into a dual line and house system. Over the history of the college, each of the two systems has varied in importance, with the house system often falling into disuse before being revived, as was the case in 1986 and 2011, whilst the line system was briefly abandoned in 1988.\nIn the provision of teaching, the college has been organised by departments since the 1980s, with shared departmental staff rooms and subject-specific blocs and classrooms. Certain departments cater for a range of subjects and courses, as is the case with the sciences, mathematics, humanities and arts departments.\nIn the achievement of pupils, the college is organised into a prefectorial system (which also has limited disciplinary powers) and a colours system.\nLine system.\nIn accordance with traditions in English Jesuit schools, Wimbledon College students are organised into a system of 'lines' rather than year groups. The lines are: Figures (year 7), Rudiments (year 8), Lower Grammar (year 9), Grammar (year 10), Syntax (year 11), Poetry (year 12) and Rhetoric (year 13). Each line has its own head of line responsible for the discipline and pastoral care of its pupils; and each line is subdivided into eight forms to which boys belong for administrative purposes and for morning registration and prayers.\nBoys in Figures, Rudiments and Lower Grammar are grouped together in the 'Lower Line' whilst boys in Grammar and Syntax are placed into the 'Higher Line'. There is a Deputy Head Master for the Lower Line and a second Deputy Head Master for the Higher Line. The sixth form has its own separate head of sixth form and is largely excluded from the line system.\nHouse system.\nUpon joining the college, each pupil is assigned to one of the school's eight houses. Traditionally, families are able to request to be placed in the same houses. Each house is named after a saint. Every house has a head of house, which is a member of the teaching staff, and a house captain, which is a student and a member of the prefectorial team.\nSince the creation of the four new houses in 2011, the house system and the line system have become partially merged through house-specific forms (for which purpose the new houses were created). Each form encompasses all the boys of a line in a specific house, leading to forms being named, for example, 'Grammar Southwell' and 'Poetry Campion'.\nThe school organises annual interhouse competitions, including in music, debating, spelling bees, subject quizzes, rugby, football, cricket and dodgeball. There is additionally a sports day at the end of each year for the four junior lines which is organised as an interhouse competition within each line at Wimbledon Park. For participation in these interhouse competitions and for good behaviour and positive contributions in school, students in the Lower and Higher Lines are awarded with house points which accumulate over the course of a year. Individual students can receive prizes after attaining a certain number of house points, including certificates of achievement, lunch passes to skip queues in the refectory; forms and houses which accumulate the most points over the course of a year are also rewarded collectively. The Sixth Form remains to be fully amalgamated into the house points system, with many of the interhouse competitions weakly attended by those in Poetry and Rhetoric.\nPrefectorial system.\nEach year, a number of prefects are appointed by the head master on the recommendation of teachers and Poetry pupils. Prefects are selected when they are in Poetry and serve in office during their year in Rhetoric. Over the history of the college, prefects at times had a considerable and sometimes essential role in the day-to-day organisation and discipline management of the college; however, they now enjoy considerably less authority and prefects are now mostly called upon to represent the school at public events, such as at open days, and assisting teachers when required logistically, such as when escorting pupils to venues in public.\nA number of prefects hold specific offices with additional responsibilities. These include house captains (who lead house assemblies), subject-specific prefects (such as the Chaplaincy prefect) who work closely with departments, the head boy, the deputy head boy and various sports prefects (who are also senior team captains).\nColours system.\nIn order to recognise the achievement of its pupils in certain fields, such as music, sports and extracurricular activities, the college annually awards high-performing students honorary ties, known as 'colours'. Pupils are nominated for colours by the teaching staff and nominations are then assessed by the Gold Committee in order to ensure that consistent standards are met across the fields in which colours are awarded.\nThe lowest tier of the colours system, intermediate colours, is awarded to pupils in Grammar and Syntax. Half colours are then awarded to Syntax and Poetry students. The highest tier of the colours system, full colours, is awarded to Poetry and Rhetoric students.\nSixth form.\nWimbledon College has a sixth form catering for 296 pupils aged 16 to 19. As well as the provision of traditional A-levels and the Extended Project Qualification, the sixth form offers a number of vocational qualifications, including level 3 and level 2 BTECs and some GCSEs.\nSince 1982, Wimbledon College and the Ursuline High School have worked in a consortium whereby pupils at either school can attend lessons at the other. Students at the Ursuline High School additionally have extensive non-reciprocal access to study resources at Wimbledon College, including its sixth form centre. The sixth form is served by its own pastoral support assistant; and its two-storey centre, formally known as the Milward Centre, includes a study hall, a common room, two offices and a smaller study room.\nTraditions and activities.\nThe sixth form encourages pupils to partake in the events of the wider school and in some opportunities specific to the sixth form.\nThe college has a longstanding tradition of societies often organised by sixth formers (including a debating society which was popularly attended for a large portion of the 20th century); however, no such formal societies have existed in recent years, with the exception of the Old Wimbledonians Association's Sinnott Society, to which current pupils are regularly invited in order to hear speakers who previously attended the college. The school's annual magazine, \"The Wimbledonian\", was also formerly a \"sixth-form satirical pamphlet\" written largely by pupils; however, it is now professionally written mostly by staff with the assistance of student editorial assistants.\nIn the academic year 2016–17, opportunities offered specifically to boys at the sixth form included eucharistic ministry at the school's Masses, an annual homeless sleep-out in the grounds of the college in support of local homelessness charities, pilgrimages, topical panels, peer mentoring and subject-specific clubs.\nUntil recently, under the 'Project Manvi' scheme, Wimbledon College would invite sixth form pupils to visit a school in India with which it was partnered and had helped to establish.\nAcademic results.\nAt the most recent Ofsted inspection in 2013, the school was upgraded from satisfactory to good. The Education Commission of the Diocese of Southwark rates the school's effectiveness, pupil outcomes, management and leadership as outstanding for Catholic education; however, its provision of such education is rated as good.\nResults at the college have been resurging after a slight fall in recent years. In 2013, 90% of pupils achieved 5 or more grades at A* to C and 29% achieved 5 or more grades at A* to A at GCSE level. These attainments were reduced to 72% and 20% respectively in 2015; the former rose back to 84% in 2017. At A-level, in 2012, 15% of grades were at A*, compared to 6% in 2016. The percentage of grades at A* to C grades fell from 82% in 2012 to 75% in 2017.\nThe school's performance has been consistently average or above-average on the Progress 8 score since it was introduced, having been 0.47 in 2017. The college ranked sixth out of nine state schools in Merton on that score in 2016 and 2017. On the Attainment 8 score, which measures progress in an array of specific subjects, the college ranked third in the local authority in 2016.\nExtracurricular activities.\nThe college has a strong history in the provision of extracurricular activities, especially in sports, music and drama and chaplaincy. Each year, students are encouraged to take part in at least two extracurricular activities.\nSports.\nWimbledon College has a selection of major and minor sports. Rugby is the biggest major sport, followed closely by football; the other major sports are athletics, cricket, swimming, basketball. The minor sports, offered regularly at the college, include cross-country running, skiing, golf, badminton, table tennis, tennis, boxing and fitness training. The distinction between major and minor sports is arbitrary and merely demonstrates the emphases put on sports outside of scheduled lessons. The school also offers fencing and other sports in addition to its major and minor sports.\nIn 2010, and again in 2016, the Wimbledon College U13 team won the Rosslyn Park National Schools Sevens Junior Trophy. On 24 March 2017, the Wimbledon College U14 rugby team won the same tournament's U14 Trophy.\nOn 4 May 2012, the U14A football team won The Collingwood Trophy.\nIn 2018, the college's 1st XI (football) came runners up in the London U18 Catholic Cup, losing 1–0 to St. Charles Catholic Sixth Form College in extra time.\nIn the summer term, rugby is no longer played, with cricket and athletics becoming the major sports. Athletics is practised at Wimbledon Park and cricket is played at the school's grounds in Coombe Lane. These all complement the school's annual interhouse sports day at Wimbledon Park.\nMusic and drama.\nThe college is notable for its school productions, at least one of which has been produced every year since 1972, usually in partnership with the Ursuline High School. To assist in these productions, a revolving stage was built in the auditorium of the new hall and the school has a well-attended stage crew. Simon Potter MBE started the collaboration with the Ursuline, and produced, directed, adapted or wrote 67 plays and musicals between 1972 and 2022.\nThe college choir sings at school liturgies and concerts and organises annual trips abroad. The college also organises an array of orchestras and music bands, a Saturday music school, music lessons in partnership with Merton Music Foundation. The Strings Project, established in 2005, gives 50 boys in Figures the opportunity to learn the violin, viola, cello, or the double bass.\nChaplaincy.\nThe college collectively celebrates Masses at regular occasions as part of its timetabled day, including on the feast days of its house saints and on Remembrance Sunday, as well as annual services such as the solemn Tenebrae service before Easter and a carol service before the end of the Christmas term. Such Masses are compulsory for most pupils. A separate evening carol service before Christmas is also organised in partnership with the Ursuline High School. Furthermore, the college has regular Masses on Monday lunchtimes and Tuesday mornings.\nAs a result of these Masses, the school organises various lay ministries, including reading and altar serving. The Guild of St. Stephen was started to recognise boys who had been regularly altar serving at Mass. Members of the Guild are eligible for a bronze medal which they may hang around their necks while serving in such Masses.\nOther.\nThe college is home to 136 Detachment, part of South West London Army Cadet Force, which wears the cap-badge of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment. The ACF offers young people the opportunity to take part in activities such as field-craft, navigation, skill-at-arms, first aid, shooting, drill, sports, and the Duke of Edinburgh's Award (Bronze, Silver, and Gold). The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is also offered separately by the school at bronze level.\nThe college takes part in the Jack Petchey Award, is affiliated with a local scouts group and has, alongside its wealth of other activities, a chess club and 3D printing club.\nA student council meets annually. Its meetings are co-chaired by a senior prefect (usually the Head Boy) and its recommendations are taken to the school's Senior Leadership Team.\nJesuit traditions.\nAs a Jesuit school, the college uses St Ignatius Loyola SJ's Prayer for Generosity as its college prayer; this is recited regularly at school assemblies and functions. The school also has a strong focus on characters and virtues in the wider context of spiritual development, a fundamental aim of Jesuit education. In keeping with the traditions of Jesuit education, students are required to write 'AMDG' and 'LDS' at the start and end of each piece of work respectively; these are Latin abbreviations for \"Ad majorem Dei gloriam\" (\"to the greater glory of God\") and \"Laus Deo semper\" (\"praise be to God always\").\nOld Wimbledonians Association.\nThe Old Wimbledonians Association is an alumnus network of former Wimbledon College and Donhead pupils. Officially established in 1923, it can trace its roots to 1905. It runs regular sports fixtures from its grounds at Coombe Lane (separate to those of the college), which also include a bar. Additionally, the Old Wimbledonians Association organises the Sinnott Society, a biannual group which meets to hear talks from other alumni alongside current Sixth Form pupils.\nHead masters.\nA list of prefects of studies (before 1944) and headmasters (after 1944) with the years they were in the role:"

        "text": "Willie Lloyd Anderson Jr. (born January 8, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player. During his professional career, Anderson played nine seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and three seasons in the EuroLeague. He was named to the 1988–89 NBA season's All-Rookie First Team. While he was a member of the Greek Basket League club AEK Athens, he played in the 1998 EuroLeague Final. Anderson won an Olympic bronze medal as a member of the United States national team in 1988.\nCollege career.\nAfter playing high school basketball at East Atlanta High, Anderson played college basketball at the University of Georgia, with the Georgia Bulldogs, from 1984 to 1988.

        "text": "Leonard Thomas Blackburn (January 23, 1906 – March 6, 1964) was an American basketball coach. The Peebles, Ohio native served as head men's basketball coach at the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio, from 1947 until his death in 1964. He led the Dayton Flyers to a championship at the 1962 National Invitation Tournament.\nEarly life.\nBlackburn was born in 1906. He was employed as a steelworker for two years before enrolling at Wilmington College where he played football, basketball and baseball. After graduation, he coached high school basketball for four years in West Carrollton, Ohio and eight seasons at Xenia, Ohio Central High School, where six of his eight teams won championships, including the state title in 1942.\nIn World War II, Blackburn joined the Navy physical education program at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. After the war, he became a golf pro in North Carolina.\nHead coaching career.\nBlackburn became Dayton's first full-time basketball coach in 1947, inheriting a moribund team that had won seven total games over the previous two seasons. Blackburn's insistence on strict discipline within his program helped lift Dayton to national prominence in the following years. Blackburn's second team finished with a winning record and was invited to the National Catholic Invitational post-season tournament. Two years later, Blackburn's Flyers would receive the first of 10 NIT invitations. Blackburn established Dayton as a national college basketball powerhouse through the 1950s and early 1960s, advancing to the NIT Finals six times in what at the time was regarded as the more prestigious post season college basketball tournament. Blackburn had a 352–141 record (.714) in 17 seasons as the Flyers head coach, held a 22–12 record (.647) in postseason play, and won an NIT championship in 1962. Blackburn fell ill with cancer during the 1963–64 season, but coached the Flyers through all but the final three games before stepping down. Assistant coach Don Donoher served as interim coach for the rest of the season, though Dayton credits the entire season to Blackburn. Blackburn died on March 6, 1964, eight days after his last game on the Flyers bench.\nAwards and recognition.\nThe University of Dayton inducted Blackburn into its Athletics Hall of Fame in 1969, and named the playing court at the University of Dayton Arena after their former coach. The winner of the annual Dayton-Xavier basketball game is awarded the Blackburn/McCafferty Trophy, named for the two former basketball coaches at each university."

        "text": "Reggie Williams (born March 5, 1964) is a retired professional basketball player who played ten seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was an All-American college player at Georgetown University and was a member of their 1983–84 National Championship team.\nHigh school and college career.\nWilliams began his career as a McDonald's High School All-American while attending Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore, where he played with fellow NBA players Muggsy Bogues, Reggie Lewis, and David Wingate. The 1981–82 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29–0 during Williams's junior season and finished 31–0 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by USA Today.\nHe then attended Georgetown and enjoyed an outstanding collegiate career. In his four seasons at Georgetown, he was amongst career leaders in scoring, rebounding, assists and steals in school history, finishing no lower than seventh in any category. As a freshman, he scored 19 points and grabbed seven rebounds against the University of Houston in the 1984 national championship game which the Hoyas won 84–75. Williams was named Most Valuable Player of the championship game. As a senior during the 1986–87 season, Williams was the leader of a young team which became a contender for a national championship. During that season he led the Big East in scoring, and led the team in rebounding, steals and blocked shots, and was third in assists. Because of Williams's play, it led Georgetown coach Thompson to dub the team \"Reggie and the Miracles\". The team won a share of the 1986–87 Big East Championship and the Big East Tournament. In the 1987 NCAA tournament, the Hoyas reached the Southeast Regional Final, but lost to Providence College, 88–73.\nProfessional career.\nWilliams was selected with the fourth pick overall of the 1987 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 12, 1987, Williams scored 34 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a loss against the Seattle SuperSonics.\nWilliams would spend ten seasons (1987–1997) in the league, playing for the Clippers, Cleveland Cavaliers, San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets (who he spent parts of 6 seasons with, the most of any franchise he played with), Indiana Pacers and New Jersey Nets.\nDuring the 1991-92 NBA season with Denver, Williams played 81 games and averaged career-highs of 18.2 points and 1.8 steals per game. Twice in that season Williams recorded a career-best 7 steals in a single game. On December 1, 1992, Williams scored 35 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in a 112-105 win against the Houston Rockets.\nIn the 1994 NBA playoffs, Williams played a key role in Denver’s unprecedented upset of the SuperSonics in the first round. It was the first time in league history that an 8 seed beat a 1 seed in the first round.\nHe retired with career totals of 7,508 points and 2,393 rebounds.\nIn July 2021, sportswriter Bill Simmons said “I still feel like if Reggie Williams goes to a different team, his entire career is different. The Clippers stamp went right on him,” when discussing the 1987 NBA draft.\nLife after the NBA.\nWilliams became the boys' basketball coach at Towson Catholic High School on May 30, 2009. He had previously served in the same capacity at Jericho Christian Academy in Landover, Maryland until it closed several weeks later. In 2010, he became coach at Archbishop Carroll High School in Washington, D.C. He resigned in February 2013."

        "text": "Scott Christopher Williams (born March 21, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Standing at 6' 10\", he was capable of playing as a power forward or a center. Early in his professional career, Williams earned three NBA Finals rings as he contributed off the bench during the Chicago Bulls' first three-peat championships from 1991–1993. He developed into a front-court reserve during his fifteen seasons in the NBA, where he was known for his hustle and strong defense. Since his retirement, Williams has coached in the NBA Development League and NBA as well as commentating for a variety of NBA teams. Williams is currently the color analyst for the Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball team.\nEarly life and college career.\nWilliams attended and played basketball for Glen A. Wilson High School in Hacienda Heights, California. He led the 1986 squad to the 1986 C.I.F State Championship Title. Williams was named a McDonald's All-American in 1986.\nHe enrolled at the University of North Carolina.\nWilliams' parents died on October 15, 1987, when his father shot and killed his mother in their garage, then turned the gun on himself. He was 19 years old, and was in his sophomore year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; coach Dean Smith notified him of the tragedy.\nGrowing up, Williams was a passionate Los Angeles Lakers fan.\nProfessional career.\nUndrafted in the 1990 NBA draft, after four years in college, Williams was signed by the Chicago Bulls in 1990. He played four seasons in Chicago, mostly as a reserve, and won three championship rings in his very first three NBA seasons. On 7 June 1991, in game 3 of the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, he scored four points (all from the free throw line), grabbed two rebounds, and had two assists in only 11 minutes of play, in an eventual 104–96 overtime Bulls win. On February 16, 1994, Williams scored his career-high of 22 points in a 109-101 loss against the Miami Heat.\nIn 1994, Williams was signed by the Philadelphia 76ers, where he played for 4½ injury-plagued seasons before being traded to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1999. His career saw a resurgence of sorts in Milwaukee, where he averaged career-highs of 7.6 points and 6.6 rebounds during the 1999–2000 season. On December 15, of that season, Williams scored 17 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a win against the Orlando Magic. While in Milwaukee, Williams was considered a key part of the 2001 Bucks team that made it to the conference finals before losing to his former team, the Philadelphia 76ers. Williams was controversially suspended for Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals series when a flagrant one foul was upgraded to a flagrant two foul after the game had ended, and the Bucks went on to lose the final game.\nUntil his retirement in 2005, at the age of 37, he also played for the Denver Nuggets, the Phoenix Suns (one ½ seasons), the Dallas Mavericks (27 games), and the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nDuring his final season, he became LeBron James's oldest teammate and the only one born in the 1960s.\nPost-retirement.\nSubsequently, Williams accepted the Cavaliers' offer to become a color commentator for the team's telecasts on FSN Ohio, beginning in 2005–06, and working alongside Michael Reghi. After two seasons, on 20 October 2007, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported he would join the Milwaukee Bucks' commentary team. Besides doing pre and post-game analysis for home games, he also called some games while a popular emailer on the Tony Kornheiser radio show.\nIn 2008, Williams became a color commentator for another former team, the Phoenix Suns, broadcasting with Tom Leander and Gary Bender.\nDuring the 2012–13 season, Williams was an assistant coach for the Idaho Stampede in the NBA Development League.\nPrior to the 2013–14 season, Williams was hired as an assistant coach for the Milwaukee Bucks under Larry Drew.\nAs of the 2014-15 season, Williams serves as the analyst for Grand Canyon Antelopes men's basketball games on Fox 10 Extra, alongside play-by-play announcer Barry Buetel.\nIn 2020, on the 'Sixers Talk' podcast, Williams credited Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls with helping him have an NBA career. Williams had played four years at North Carolina but had gone undrafted in the NBA draft. Jordan invited Williams to a scrimmage, which also included other NBA pros, so Williams could prove his worth. Later, Jordan called then-Bulls general manager Jerry Krause and stated \"I think Scott Williams might be able to help us out\". The Bulls would eventually sign Williams and he would earn three NBA Finals rings (in his first three years in the league) when the Bulls capped the first of their two NBA Finals three-peat wins, from 1991-1993. Williams goes on to state \"I always say I am the luckiest undrafted player in the history of the NBA, if there is such a thing\"."

He later joined the Richmond Hill-Vaughan Kings of OMHA. After being a 7th round draft choice of the OHL's Guelph Storm in 1995, Weaver decided to remain playing OHA Junior A hockey to maintain his NCAA scholarship eligibility.\nWeaver played Tier II Jr.A. with both the Thornhill Islanders and the Bramalea Blues. His final season with the Blues he led the club to a Dudley Hewitt Cup as OHA Junior A Champions and a berth in the 1999 Royal Bank Cup in Yorkton, Saskatchewan; Weaver's team was eliminated in the semi-finals.\nThe diminutive defenceman acquired a scholarship with the Michigan State Spartans and spent four very productive years in the CCHA that included two First All-Star team nods and two Best Defensive Defenceman awards.\nUndrafted by the NHL, Weaver was signed as a free agent by the Atlanta Thrashers on June 15, 2000. He spent the subsequent season with Atlanta's IHL affiliate, Orlando, with whom he won the Turner Cup as IHL champions. In 2001–02, Weaver played his first 16 games in the NHL, in addition to helping the Thrashers' AHL affiliate, the Chicago Wolves, to a Calder Cup championship.

He is a three-time Stanley Cup champion, having won twice with Detroit in 1997 and 1998 and once with Carolina in 2006.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Windsor, Ontario, Ward moved with his family to Blackburn Hamlet, Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa, as a youth where he attended Emily Carr Middle School. He played in the 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Gloucester, Ontario.\nWard played junior hockey for the Nepean Raiders of the Central Junior A Hockey League before accepting a scholarship to attend the University of Michigan. After one season playing for the Wolverines ice hockey team, he was drafted fifth overall by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft.\nBefore his playing days at Michigan were over, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, signing with the club in 1993. He was then assigned to the Red Wings' affiliate Adirondack Red Wings for the 1993–94 season, where he spent the bulk of the next three seasons. He later made his NHL debut in 1993–94 and scored his first career NHL goal at the Arrowhead Pond on October 8, 1993. Ward became a regular NHLer during the 1996–97 season.\nWard has played over 600 career NHL games and been a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams, two while playing for the Red Wings in 1997 1998 and one with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006. In 2006, Ward scored the first goal in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals to help his team win the Cup. After the 2006 season, Ward became an unrestricted free agent, whereupon he signed with the New York Rangers, joining fellow free agent and 2006 Cup-winning teammate Matt Cullen in New York. Ward's tenure as a Ranger, however, was short-lived, as during the 2006–07 season, among rumours of tension between him and then-Rangers captain Jaromír Jágr, Ward found himself traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for defenceman Paul Mara. With Boston, Ward added solid defence and much-needed veteran leadership to the team, and was often paired with Zdeno Chára on Boston's top defensive line.\nPrior to the 2009–10 season, on July 24, 2009, Ward was re-acquired by Carolina in exchange for forward Patrick Eaves and a fourth-round draft pick in 2010. Ward struggled in his return with the Hurricanes, however, and on March 3, 2010, he was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for goaltender Justin Pogge and a fourth-round draft pick. During the subsequent off-season, on August 24, Ward announced his retirement from professional hockey after 13 NHL seasons.\nBroadcasting career.\nIn the spring of 2007 and 2010, Ward was the NHL on Versus analyst for the Stanley Cup playoffs and since then joined the Big Ten Network as the hockey analyst. Ward previously worked as a hockey analyst on TSN Hockey until 2015. In April 2019, he was hired by a local ABC affiliate station as an analyst to cover the Hurricanes' playoff run.\nPersonal life.\nIn March 2008, Ward, in conjunction with the Toucher and Rich radio program (WBCN 104.1) created a head-shaving charity event called 'Cuts for a Cause'. Seven players from the Boston Bruins shaved their heads to raise money to benefit the MassGeneral Hospital for Children. Patrice Bergeron, Phil Kessel, Andrew Alberts, Milan Lucic, Mark Stuart and Dennis Wideman joined Ward in helping raise $25,000. A second 'Cuts for a Cause' event took place in April 2009 with the group raising $32,000 for the Boston Bruins Foundation and MassGeneral Hospital for Children's Pediatric Oncology Unit.\nOn October 9, 2015, Ward was arrested at his home in Cary, North Carolina and charged with assault on a female and interfering with emergency communication. According to the warrant, he and his wife had an argument during which he took away his wife's phone. This incident led to his indefinite suspension from his job as an analyst on TSN Hockey. The charges were dismissed and the record expunged by the Wake County District Attorney's Office in February 2016, stating that “After review of this case and discussions with the victim, it appears that further prosecution is not warranted.”"

        "title": "Grand slam (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, a grand slam is a home run hit with all three bases occupied by baserunners (\"bases loaded\"), thereby scoring four runs—the most possible in one play. According to \"The Dickson Baseball Dictionary\", the term originated in the card game of contract bridge, in which a \"grand slam\" involves taking all the possible tricks. The word \"slam\", by itself, usually is connected with a loud sound, particularly of a door being closed with excess force; thus, \"slamming the door\" on one's opponent(s), in addition to the bat slamming the ball into a home run.\nHighlights.\nPlayers.\nRoger Connor is believed to have been the first major league player to hit a grand slam, on September 10, 1881, for the Troy Trojans of the National League (NL) at Riverfront Park in Rensselaer, New York. Although Charlie Gould hit one for the Boston Red Stockings of the National Association (NA) in 1871, the NA is not recognized by Major League Baseball (MLB) as a major league.\nAlex Rodriguez has 25 career grand slams, the most by any player in MLB history. Don Mattingly () and Travis Hafner () share the single-season record with six grand slams each – in Mattingly's case, these were the only grand slams of his major league career. Ernie Banks () and Albert Pujols () share the single-season National League record with five grand slams each.\nIn 1968, Jim Northrup of the Detroit Tigers set a major league record by hitting three grand slams in a week, including two in consecutive at-bats of a game. This feat (three grand slams in one week) would later be matched by Larry Parrish of the Texas Rangers in 1982. However, Northrup hit his three slams in only 14 plate appearances, setting a record that still stands \nSeveral grand slams, the first being Connor's in 1881, consisted of a player hitting a walk-off grand slam for a one-run victory; some baseball observers call this an \"ultimate grand slam\". Roberto Clemente is the only player to have hit a walk-off inside-the-park grand slam in a one-run victory; when the Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Chicago Cubs 9–8 on July 25, 1956 at Forbes Field, a park known for its spacious outfield. The most recent ultimate grand slam was hit on September 20, 2022, by Giancarlo Stanton in the New York Yankees' 9–8 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nFour players hit a grand slam in their first Major League at-bat: Bill Duggleby (), Jeremy Hermida (), Kevin Kouzmanoff (), and Daniel Nava (). Kouzmanoff, Nava, and Duggleby hit theirs on the first pitch; Hermida's grand slam was in a pinch-hit at bat.\nTony Cloninger is the only pitcher to hit two grand slams in one game, for the Atlanta Braves in a contest against the San Francisco Giants.\nFélix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners became the first American League pitcher since the designated hitter rule went into effect in to hit a grand slam when he did so on June 23, , against the New York Mets in an interleague game.\nThe only major league player to hit two grand slams in one inning is Fernando Tatís of the St. Louis Cardinals, in , both grand slams coming off Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher Chan Ho Park in the third inning. Tatis was only the second National League player to hit two grand slams in one game, joining Cloninger. Park was only the second pitcher in major league history to give up two grand slams in one inning, joining Bill Phillips of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who did it in , one to Tom Burns and one to Malachi Kittridge. Therefore, Park was the first to give up both to the same batter. Tatis had never hit a grand slam before in his career. Bill Mueller is the only player to hit grand slams from both sides of the plate in the same game, when he hit two in for the Boston Red Sox against the Texas Rangers. Robin Ventura is the only player to hit a grand slam in both games of a doubleheader, when he did so in for the New York Mets against the Milwaukee Brewers.\nIn Japan's professional league, the feat of multiple grand slams in a single inning by a team has been accomplished three times; most recently on April 1, 2007 by José Fernández and Takeshi Yamasaki of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. The Daiei Hawks accomplished the feat in .\nTeam.\nIn , the Chicago White Sox hit grand slams in three consecutive games against the Houston Astros (June 23–25). Scott Podsednik hit the only grand slam of his career in the series opener. Joe Crede followed up with a slam of his own on Saturday, and Tadahito Iguchi hit a game tying grand slam in the bottom of the ninth with two outs in the series finale. The White Sox became the first team to accomplish this since the Detroit Tigers in . On the other hand, the Kansas City Royals surrendered grand slams in three straight games; two against the Baltimore Orioles (April 13–14) and one against the Tigers (April 16).\nOn August 25, , the New York Yankees became the first team in MLB history to hit three grand slams in one game. Robinson Canó, Russell Martin and Curtis Granderson took Oakland Athletics pitchers Rich Harden, Fautino de los Santos, and Bruce Billings deep, with each grand slam being hit in a different inning. The Yankees would win the game 22–9.\nOn June 3, , a record-breaking seven grand slams were hit on one day: One each for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Milwaukee Brewers, Atlanta Braves, Colorado Rockies, Chicago Cubs, Seattle Mariners, and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim whose Albert Pujols hit his 600th career home run.\nOn August 20, , the San Diego Padres became the first team to hit a grand slam in four consecutive games when Fernando Tatis Jr, Wil Myers, Manny Machado, and Eric Hosmer each hit a grand slam in a series against the Texas Rangers.\nOn October 16, , in Game 2 of the 2021 ALCS against the Houston Astros, the Boston Red Sox became the first team to hit two grand slams in one postseason game when J. D. Martinez hit one in the first inning and Rafael Devers hit one in the second. Two days later, in Game 3 of the series, Kyle Schwarber hit another slam for Boston to make the Red Sox the first team to hit three grand slams in one postseason series.\nNotable calls.\n\"Get out the rye bread and the mustard, Grandma, it is grand salami time!\"—used by longtime Seattle Mariners lead commentator Dave Niehaus from the 1995 season until his death in November 2010. Currently used by Niehaus' longtime partner Rick Rizzs.\nVarious newspaper accounts show players used the term \"grand salami\" for a grand slam at least as early as 1966. \"When Ernie Banks hits a grand slam he always calls it a 'grand salami,'\" reported Jack Lang. \"'In that way I always manage to get a nice big salami delivered to my home by the Hebrew National salami people,' Banks laughed.\""

        "title": "Nintendo World Cup",
        "text": "Nintendo World Cup is a soccer video game for the Family Computer/NES and Game Boy, developed by Technōs Japan and released in 1990. It is a localization of the fourth \"Kunio-kun\" game released for the Family Computer. Ports for the PC Engine and Mega Drive were also released in Japan. A Game Boy version was released in Japan, North America, and Europe.\nPlot.\nNekketsu High School Dodgeball Club: Soccer.\nEight students known as Atsushi, Genei, Hiroshi, Kunio, Masa, Masahiro, Susumu and Takashi compete in a soccer tournament against 13 other high schools.\nNintendo World Cup.\nThirteen national teams compete in a world cup to become number 1. At the time of the game's release, the German team represented West Germany, with the East German team reunifying with West Germany later on in 1990.\nGameplay.\nAt its core, the game follows the rules of football, but with noticeable differences. Each team has only six players (a goalkeeper, two defenders, a midfielder and two forwards). You control only one of them, but you can give commands (Pass/Shoot) to the others. Offsides are non-existent and fouls are not punished. Players can be knocked out by repeatedly sliding, tackling or shooting them, afterwards they will stay down for the rest of the half. Players can also use up to five \"\"super shots\" per half; these powerful, odd-looking shots are used whenever a player does a bicycle kick or most of the time when doing a diving header, or when he shoots after walking a certain number of steps. The \"super shots\"\" differ from team to team. The playing fields also differ in respect to material, e.g. ice, which heavily impacts movement of players and the ball.\nThere are two game modes:\nGraphically, the NES version game looks similar to the Famicom version and other games in the \"Kunio-kun\" series, particularly \"Downtown Nekketsu Story/River City Ransom\", with its short-legged, big-headed characters with varied faces; in fact, some sprites, such as Kunio and the other members of the Japanese team, were reused from that game.\nRegional differences.\nThe NES version of \"Nekketsu High School Dodge Ball Club: Soccer Edition\", \"Nintendo World Cup\", differs from its counterpart, in that the game centers around a World Cup set in Japan between thirteen high schools, instead of a soccer tournament. In the main Tournament Mode, the player takes control of the main team of Nekketsu High School team and competes against the other twelve teams. The Tournament Mode's opening intro and story sequences are removed in the NES version. In the Famicom version's \"Vs. Match Mode\", the player can only choose between the Nekketsu team and four other teams. Since the main Tournament Mode in the Famicom version only featured a single team, the NES localization allows the player to choose between the thirteen nationalities represented in the game by changing the palette of the player's team and their super shots. Unlike the Famicom version, the NES version supports up to four players instead of two.\nPorts.\nGame Boy.\nA port to the Game Boy was released as in Japan and was based on \"Nintendo World Cup\". It was released in North America and Europe under the same name.\nPC Engine CD.\nThe game was ported to PC Engine's Super CD-ROM² and retitled and was released on December 20, 1991, published by Naxat Soft.\nThis version includes five national teams (France, Brazil, Argentina, Italy and Germany) in Tournament mode which is after beating the final match.\nPC Engine.\nA similar version for the PC Engine HuCard was released on April 13, 1992, under the title Only differences between the two versions, the CD version has an arranged soundtrack and add voice acting for opening intro and cut scene, while the HuCard version has no voice acting, etc.\nMega Drive.\nA Mega Drive version of the game, titled was released by Palsoft in Japan on August 7, 1992. Unlike the Famicom/NES version and other platforms, this version has all the teams playable in VS. Mode.\nGame Boy Advance.\nThe Famicom version of the game was ported to Game Boy Advance as the part of \"Kunio-kun Nekketsu Collection 2\" (along with \"Downtown Nekketsu Kōshinkyoku: Soreyuke Daiundōkai\"), was released on October 27, 2005, in Japan.\nVirtual Console.\nThe original Famicom version of \"Nekketsu High School Dodgeball Club: Soccer Edition\" was re-released for Virtual Console in Japan on October 7, 2008, for the Wii and on March 19, 2014, for the Wii U. As for \"Nintendo World Cup\", however, there are no plans for the game to be released in North America or PAL regions. The PC Engine Super CD-ROM² version of the game was also re-released in Japan for the Wii on November 4, 2008.\nSwitch &amp; PS4.\n\"Nekketsu High School Dodgeball Club - Soccer Story\" was released as part of the compilation title \"DOUBLE DRAGON &amp; Kunio-kun Retro Brawler Bundle\" for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on February 20, 2020."

        "text": "The 1998–99 UEFA Champions League was the 44th season of the UEFA Champions League, Europe's premier club football tournament, and the seventh since it was renamed from the \"European Champion Clubs' Cup\" or \"European Cup\". The competition was won by Manchester United, coming back from a goal down in the last two minutes of injury time to defeat Bayern Munich 2–1 in the final. Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored United's goals after Bayern had hit the post and the bar. They were the first English club to win Europe's premier club football tournament since 1984 and were also the first English club to reach a Champions League final since the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent banning of English clubs from all UEFA competitions between 1985 and 1990. It was the first time since 1968 that Manchester United won the Champions League, giving them their second title.\nManchester United also completed the Treble, becoming the fourth side in Europe to do so and in the process prevented Bayern Munich from achieving the feat themselves, Bayern eventually finished runners-up in their domestic cup two weeks later.\nManchester United won the trophy without losing a single match, despite having competed in a group with Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Brøndby, plus two highly rated Italian clubs in the knock-out stages. However, United became champions with just five wins in total, the lowest number of wins recorded by a champion in the Champions League era to date, though the competition now has an extra round of two matches in the knock-out stages.\nIt was the first time the Champions League was won by a team that had neither won their domestic league nor the Champions League the previous season and therefore would not have qualified for the tournament under the old qualification rules (title holder or national league champion). For the second time, the runners-up of eight domestic leagues entered the competition.\nReal Madrid were the defending champions but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Dynamo Kyiv.\nAssociation team allocation.\nNumber of teams per country as well as the starting round for each club and seeding were based on 1998 UEFA league coefficient, which takes into account their performance in European competitions from 1993–94 to 1997–98.\nRound and draw dates.\nThe schedule of the competition is as follows (all draws are held in Geneva, Switzerland, unless stated otherwise).\nQualifying rounds.\nSecond qualifying round.\nLosing teams qualified for the first round of the 1998–99 UEFA Cup.\nNote: Winning teams of the first qualifying round were drawn against teams qualified directly for the second qualifying round (16 and 16 teams).\nGroup stage.\nTwenty-four teams took part in the group stage: the national champions of Italy, Germany, Spain, France, Netherlands, England and Portugal, the title holders, and the 16 winning teams from the second qualifying round. Arsenal, Athletic Bilbao, Brøndby, Croatia Zagreb, HJK, Internazionale, Kaiserslautern, Lens and Sturm Graz made their debuts in the group stage of the competition. This was the first time that a team from Finland played in the group stage.\nThe teams were divided into six groups of four teams each, with the teams in each group playing each other twice (home and away) in a double round-robin format. Three points were awarded for each win, with one point each for a draw and none for a defeat. The winners of each group progressed to the quarter-finals, along with the two best second-placed teams. In the event that two or more teams had the same number of points at the end of the group stage, the rankings of the teams in question were determined by the following criteria:\nThe two best runners-up were determined by the following criteria:\nKnockout stage.\nThe knockout stage was played in a single-elimination tournament format consisting of three rounds: quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. Each tie in the quarter-finals and semi-finals was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home, while the final was played as a single match at a neutral venue. In the quarter-finals and semi-finals, in the event that two teams scored the same number of goals over the two legs of their tie, the winner would be determined by the number of goals scored away from home. If both sides scored the same number of goals away from home, two 15-minute periods of extra time would be played. If both teams scored the same number of goals during extra time, the visiting team would qualify for the next round by having scored more goals away from home. If neither side scored during extra time, the match would be decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, if the scores were level after 90 minutes, two 15-minute periods of golden goal extra time would be played; i.e. whichever team scored first would be declared the winner. If neither side scored during golden goal extra time, a penalty shoot-out would again be used to determine the winner.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, the two best runners-up cannot be drawn together, nor could the winners and runners-up from the same group. Both runners-up played the first leg of their quarter-final at home, as did the other two teams drawn first in the other two quarter-finals.\nTop goalscorers.\nThe top scorers from the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League (excluding qualifying rounds) are as follows:"

        "text": "The Walhalla Cricket Ground is a landmark in Walhalla, Victoria, Australia. Linked by a walking track from Walhalla Road, the cricket ground is perched at the top of a hill. Because there was a lack of flat ground in the township the mining community, in their spare time, carved the top off the mountain to construct a ground, this work being completed in 1882. It is claimed that the half-hour climb up the hill to reach the ground, in conjunction with the long trip to Walhalla itself, ensured a home advantage.\nIn the heyday of Walhalla's goldmining era, the ground was used for organised sporting events, including those of the Walhalla Football Association. Since large-scale mining stopped in 1910, the ground has largely been a tourist destination and curiosity, though it remained the site of occasional social cricket matches. It is referenced in Weddings Parties Anything's song \"The Ghosts of Walhalla\".\nIn January 1870, following an encouraging series of successes against teams such as Sale, Toongabbie and Tanjil, it was decided to officially form a Cricket Club in Walhalla. Mt William Gairdner, a prominent mining manager, was elected the first President of the club - which was referred to as the \"Walhalla Eleven.\" Among the first actions of this group was the petitioning of the Victorian Government to permanently reserve the land that they had selected and to circulate and raise subscriptions for the further clearing of the area which today forms Walhalla's unique cricket ground.\nIn 2017 extensive restoration work was carried out on the playing surface before the bushfire of February 2019 completely destroyed the playing surface, synthetic pitch and the surrounding bush. The ground was subsequently fully restored."

        "title": "Motocross Madness 2",
        "text": "Motocross Madness 2 is a motocross racing video game that was developed by Rainbow Studios and published by Microsoft Games.\nThis sequel to 1998's \"Motocross Madness\" was released in May 2000 with improved graphics, which included better textures and many landscape objects like trees, road signs and caravans. It has over 40 tracks in 6 event types, over 50,000 3D objects and a new career mode. Players as well as bikes are easily customized. \"Motocross Madness\" also supports network play over a LAN environment and, until June 19, 2006, multiplayer gameplay through the MSN Gaming Network.\nGameplay.\nIn \"MCM2\", there are six types of racing: Stunts, Enduro, Baja, Supercross and Nationals, and the campaign-style Pro-Circuit Mode.\nIn Pro-Circuit mode, a single player follows a series of events and courses in an effort to win prize money and upgrade equipment. Unlike the single-player mode, the multiplayer mode is completely lacking in structure. Players can race against each other on the same map, play tag and can choose from Supercross or Enduro. In either mode, players are not limited to track space, and are free to play amongst the terrain and inanimate objects or moving features such as trains, cars and farm tractors.\nIn Baja mode, the player races against other opponents to ride through checkpoints (called \"gates\") until all of the gates have been ridden through - this is one complete lap. The first player to complete a certain number of laps is the winner. Baja, unlike Nationals or Enduro, takes place in massive, open wilderness.\nIn Enduro mode, which is similar to baja, the player also races against other opponents to ride through gates, with the goal of being the first to complete a certain number of laps. Except, in this mode, the races take place in urban or rural maps, which is smaller and more variable than Baja.\nIn Nationals mode, the player is restricted to racing within a dirtbiking track against other opponents, with the goal of completing a certain number of laps first (there are no gates in this mode).\nIn Stunts mode, the player, in order to win, must accumulate the highest number of points by performing successful stunts. To perform a stunt, a rider must gain enough height in mid-air and then is able to perform any of the six stunts. A failed stunt results from the rider crashing while attempting to perform a stunt. In stunts, there is no restriction as to where the player may go, and so he may also roam freely across the map.\nIn Supercross mode, the player must race against other opponents within a dirtbiking track in a large stadium watched by an audience. It features an extreme sports-like atmosphere, with the crowd reacting to the player's performance. Supercross is similar to nationals, except for the location as well as nationals tracks are far broader and thinner, whereas Supercross tracks are large yet the track is compact.\nWhile creating a custom game in single-player, players can select the number of computer opponents to compete against, which range from 0, the minimum, to 10 - the maximum number of opponents in a game (this makes a full race in MM2 eleven players maximum). They may also select the difficulty, which ranges from easy and normal to hard. They may then also select the map/track, game mode and toggle vegetation collision (whether players can crash into solid objects, such as trees or buildings) and whether they want to record a replay of the game they are about to play. Players can also select which bike they want to compete with as well as the appearance of the suit of their rider. Players can also select the style of the game they want to play: practice, single event, ghost or tournament. Practice games never end and no players can win. Single events finish right after all players complete the track. Ghost races allow players to race against their own times (how long it took them to finish the track). Tournaments are composed of various single events.\nCustomization.\nUnlike its predecessor, \"Motocross Madness 2\" allows players to create terrains (referred to as 'maps' or 'tracks') using Adobe Photoshop and the Armadillo terrain editor. These maps can be utilized by players who download them to their PCs. Players can create their own clothing and customize their motorcycles. Microsoft added to the realism of the game by securing licensed motorcycles from Yamaha, KTM, Suzuki, and Honda.\nMusic.\n\"New Skin\", by the band Incubus, appeared in the opening segment of \"Motocross Madness 2\". It was originally taken from their 1997 album \"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\". The end credits featured the song \"Deville\" from the band Strung Out. Most of the in-game sounds, such as the bikers crying out in pain when falling or radios playing in nearby caravans, were recorded from real-life sources. Music was not played during the in-game races.\nReception.\n\"Motocross Madness 2\" received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.\nVincent Lopez of \"IGN\" said of the game: \"it's about fun, and MM2 provides this in piles and piles. The crash animations never (and I mean never) stop being anything less than hilarious, and the action is always as a pretty relentless pace. The eye-candy is constantly impressive, the physics are crazy enough to be fun but real enough to look right, and the multiplayer game is a blast, especially if you've got devious friends.\" Stephen Poole of \"GameSpot\" said that the game \"isn't the most realistic motorcycle simulation you can buy, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable.\" Jim Preston of \"NextGen\" said of the game: \"Flying spread-eagle into a cactus never looked so good.\"\nThe staff of \"Computer Gaming World\" named it the best racing game of 2000. They hailed it as \"far and away the most viscerally pleasing and outright fun racing game we've played in a long time.\" The game also won the Editor's Choice Award from \"PC Gamer\", which called it \"The PC's pre-eminent bike sim.\" The staff of \"Computer Games Magazine\" nominated it for their 2000 \"Racing Game of the Year\" award, whose winner remains unknown. During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, \"Motocross Madness 2\" won the \"PC Sports\" award, which it shared with \"FIFA 2001\", and was a nominee for the \"Visual Engineering\" award, which ultimately went to \"SSX\"."

        "title": "Mike Leach (American football coach)",
        "text": "Michael Charles Leach (March 9, 1961 – December 12, 2022) was an American college football coach who primarily coached at the NCAA Division I FBS level. He was a two-time national coach of the year, three-time conference coach of the year and the mastermind behind the NCAA record-setting air raid offense. He was the head coach at Texas Tech University from 2000 to 2009, where he became the winningest coach in school history. After Texas Tech, he coached at Washington State University from 2012 to 2019, where he recorded the third-most wins of any coach in school history. He then coached at Mississippi State University from 2020 until his death in 2022.\nLeach was known for directing offenses using lots of passing to several receivers, in a spread system known as the air raid, which Leach developed with Hal Mumme when Mumme was head coach and Leach was offensive coordinator at Iowa Wesleyan, Valdosta State, and Kentucky in the 1990s. Leach's offenses with Mumme, and later as a head coach himself, have broken numerous school and NCAA records. On eighteen occasions, Leach led his unranked team to victory over a team ranked in the AP poll, which is the most in the AP era.\nEarly life and education.\nMike Leach was born to Frank and Sandra Leach in Susanville, California. His father Frank was a forester and the family moved around several times while Leach was growing up, before finally settling in Cody, Wyoming. Leach was raised a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While growing up in Cody, he joined Boy Scout Troop 58 and earned the rank of Eagle in 1975. Leach graduated from Cody High School in 1979; he played football there from 1975 to 1978 and was recruited to play at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. An ankle injury he sustained in high school ruled out playing college football, so he played rugby instead.\nLeach stayed close to the football program, occasionally sitting in on film room sessions. Led by head coach LaVell Edwards, offensive coordinator Norm Chow, and quarterbacks Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon, and Steve Young, BYU played with a pass-heavy offense, which was uncommon in college football at that time. Leach graduated in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in American studies.\nIn 1986, Leach earned a Juris Doctor from Pepperdine University School of Law in Malibu, California. He is also one of the most prominent graduates of the United States Sports Academy in Daphne, Alabama, from which he earned a Master of Sports Science in sports coaching in 1988.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nLeach began his coaching career as an assistant at Cal Poly in 1987 before moving on to College of the Desert in 1988.\nIn 1989, he served as head coach of the Pori Bears in the American Football Association of Finland.\nAlso in 1989, he joined Hal Mumme's staff at Iowa Wesleyan University as offensive coordinator. The pair spent three seasons there before moving to Valdosta State (1992–1996) and then Kentucky (1997–1998). The partnership was known for the development of the air raid offense, which allowed their teams to rank highly in offensive statistics and set numerous records. Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch became a No. 1 overall NFL draft pick.\nFor the 1999 season, Leach joined the Oklahoma staff under head coach Bob Stoops. Oklahoma's offense, which had ranked 11th in the Big 12 Conference in 1998, improved under Leach to first in the conference in 1999.\nTexas Tech.\nAfter one year at Oklahoma, Leach was hired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders, another Big 12 member.\nUnder Leach, the Red Raiders' best finishes came with three nine-win seasons in 2002, 2005, and 2007 and an 11-win season in 2008. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals Baylor, Texas, and Texas A&amp;M for the first time since 1997 and then defeated Clemson, 55–15, in the Tangerine Bowl. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beat the Air Force Falcons in the Copper Bowl. In 2005, the Red Raiders opened their season with a 6–0 record, their best start since 1998. Leach built a strong passing offense at Tech, where the Red Raiders led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row.\nHe inserted Kliff Kingsbury at quarterback for three years. Kingsbury broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Kingsbury was succeeded at the position by B. J. Symons, who produced the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. Sonny Cumbie followed, leading the Red Raiders to an upset of the then-4th ranked California in the 2004 Holiday Bowl. Cody Hodges succeeded Cumbie, and subsequently led the NCAA in passing. Graham Harrell, the first non-senior starting QB since Kingsbury, struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against Iowa State and ended the season with a record-setting comeback victory over the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Harrell also set NCAA records for passes completed in a season and career amongst others.\nTexas Tech was known for its high-scoring offense and come-from-behind victories during Leach's tenure. A 70–35 win over TCU in 2004 began with TCU leading 21–0 with eight minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, \"They aren't going to score.\" Later in the season, Texas Tech beat Nebraska, 70–10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to Kansas State, 13–10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59–20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14–10 over Texas A&amp;M. By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56–17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series.\nLeach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural Inta Juice North–South All-Star Classic game.\nAt the end of the 2008 season, Leach was 76–39 with the Red Raiders, including 7–2 against the Texas A&amp;M Aggies and 2–7 against the Texas Longhorns. With a 5–4 record, he is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in Tech football history. Leach was one of only sixteen active college football coaches who had never had a losing season after he left Texas Tech. This was followed by a 3–9 season in his seminal year with Washington State. Of those, he is among nine who have been a head coach for at least five seasons.\nIn February 2009, Leach signed a three-year contract extension with Texas Tech that would have paid him at least $2.5 million per year if he had stayed through 2013. Leach's guaranteed compensation would have been $1.6 million in 2006, $1.65 million in 2007, $1.75 million in 2008, $1.85 million in 2009 and $2.15 million in 2010.\n2007 Texas game controversy.\nDuring his post-game press conference after the 2007 loss against Texas, Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for what he felt were bad calls. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin, because they were incompetent, or possibly because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote, \"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\" The \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\" reported, \"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\" ESPN reported, \"Big 12 official spokesman Bob Burda did not immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment. Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\"\nOn November 13, 2007, the Big 12 fined Leach $10,000, the largest fine in Big 12 history. Leach also received a reprimand and was warned that further violations could result in suspension. In a Big 12 coaches' conference call that day, Leach added that he did not regret making any of the comments. Leach announced that he would appeal the fine. Tech alumni and fans began raising money to aid Leach in paying the penalty in the event that it was upheld. Optionally, the proceeds raised could be used charitably. So, just before Christmas 2007, Leach requested that the nearly $5,000 raised be used to purchase 400 hams to give to families in Lubbock, Texas. Future donations were to go to the university or athletic department. Following the 2008 Gator Bowl, in which Virginia scored twice on penalties against Tech for intentional grounding in the end zone, Leach joked, \"I felt like we had a back there on the one safety, but I don't comment on officiating. I just give out hams is what I do.\"\n2008 season.\nLeach, along with players Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree, were featured on the cover of the 2008 edition of \"Dave Campbell's Texas Football\". The magazine predicted that the 2008 Red Raider football team would be the best in Texas and would challenge for the Big 12 South title. Following a 9–0 beginning to the season, including a win over the undefeated #1 Texas Longhorns, Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers announced that the university would renegotiate Leach's contract following the conclusion of the football regular season and give him an extension.\nThe Red Raiders ended the 2008 regular season with 11 wins and 1 loss, the best in school history. The season also marked the first win over a #1 ranked team. Tech, along with Oklahoma and Texas, shared the Big 12 Conference South division title. On December 2, 2008, the Associated Press named Leach the Big 12 Coach of the Year. He received 16 votes for the honor by the agency's panel, while Texas' Mack Brown got 4. He won co-Coach of the Year honors from the Big 12 coaches; Oklahoma's Bob Stoops received the same recognition for the same season. The \"Dallas Morning News\" named him Coach of the Year as well. He garnered the 2008 George Munger Award, which is given annually to the top college coach of the year by the Maxwell Football Club.\nAfter much controversy about how the tie-breaker should be handled between Texas, Oklahoma, and Texas Tech fans, the Red Raiders ended up being left out of the BCS because of a rule that stated only two teams from each conference could enter BCS play per season. Oklahoma won the tie-breaker on account of their higher BCS ranking, ultimately losing to Florida in the national championship game. Texas Tech also ended up losing that year in the Cotton Bowl to Ole Miss 47–34.\nLeach interviewed for the University of Washington head coaching job, which was vacated by Tyrone Willingham. ESPN reported that Leach withdrew his name from the coaching search following his interview. Auburn, where Tommy Tuberville resigned, had also been rumored to have contacted Leach. In an interview with the Associated Press, Tech quarterback Graham Harrell stated that there was a \"great chance\" Leach could leave. Harrell noted that Leach might leave for a newer challenge. After Leach withdrew his name from consideration for the Washington job, Harrell retracted his statements and believed Leach would remain the Red Raiders' coach.\nTech athletic director Gerald Myers had indicated that he would give a raise to Leach before Tech's bowl game, which he later negotiated. Leach and the university settled on a five-year extension worth $12.7 million after months of negotiations over the clauses of the contract.\n2009 season.\nOn October 31, 2009, after the Red Raiders' win over Kansas, Leach tied his predecessor Spike Dykes as the all-time winningest coach in Texas Tech's 85-year football history. On November 21, 2009, Leach passed Dykes for first all-time on the school's wins list with a win over Oklahoma.\nFiring.\nOn December 28, 2009, Leach was suspended indefinitely by Texas Tech pending investigation of alleged inappropriate treatment of Adam James, son of former SMU and New England Patriots running back (and former ESPN college football analyst) Craig James. On December 16, James suffered a concussion. He was examined the next day, and told not to practice that afternoon due to the concussion. According to a James family source, Leach ordered him to stand in the equipment room near the Raiders' practice facility.\nAccording to the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", school officials claim they gave Leach an ultimatum to apologize to James in writing by December 28 or Leach be suspended. His attorney, Ted Liggett, disputed the characterization of events as reported by the university and other news sources, and said that James had been treated reasonably in light of his condition.\nLeach sought an injunction that would have allowed him to coach in the 2010 Alamo Bowl. However, on December 30, Texas Tech fired Leach, calling his refusal to apologize to James \"a defiant act of insubordination.\" This was the day before Leach was reportedly owed an $800,000 tenure bonus and over $1,700,000 for contractual guaranteed income for 2009. Texas Tech lawyers handed a termination letter to Liggett just minutes before the two sides were to appear in a Lubbock courtroom for a hearing. Liggett was also told that Leach would not be allowed to coach in the Alamo Bowl regardless of how the hearing turned out. School officials later said that other incidents had come to light during its investigation of Leach, but declined to elaborate. Defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill was named interim head coach and led the team during their appearance in the Alamo Bowl.\nIn a statement, Leach said that he believed the firing was motivated in part by simmering acrimony over the contract negotiations. He also said he planned to sue Texas Tech for wrongful termination.\nOn December 31, Leach spoke with \"The New York Times\" in his first interview since being fired from Texas Tech. He said that he did not know where James had been taken, having only ordered him taken \"out of the light.\" He claimed the controversy stemmed from Craig James's constant lobbying for more playing time for his son, whom he characterized as lazy and feeling entitled.\nOn January 8, 2010, Leach formally filed suit against Texas Tech for wrongful termination and other claims. He claimed that school officials not only fired him without cause, but issued defamatory statements in a willful attempt to keep him from being hired elsewhere. During a deposition for the case obtained by the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\", Adam James admitted under oath that he found the closet incident \"funny\". In May 2010, District Judge Bill Sowder dismissed all but one of Leach's claims on the grounds of sovereign immunity, but he allowed Leach's claim for breach of contract to proceed, finding that Texas Tech had waived its immunity on this claim by its conduct. The judge also dismissed Leach's claims against three university administrators. Both parties took steps to appeal the decision, although Leach's attorneys said they would drop their appeal if Texas Tech would do likewise and allow the breach of contract claim to proceed to a jury trial. Early in 2011, Texas 7th Court of Appeals ruled that Texas Tech was immune from Leach's claim of breach of contract but that Leach can claim non-monetary reparations. Leach's attorney Paul Dobrowski announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas.\nIn February 2012, the Texas Supreme Court denied Leach's petition for review. After that denial, Texas Tech attorney Dicky Gregg stated \"As we've said from the beginning, we were right on the law and the facts, and the (Texas) Supreme Court has just held that we were correct on the law.\"\n\"Friday Night Lights\" series creator Peter Berg has hinted that he has written a movie script for the characters from the TV series that is based on Leach's firing from Texas Tech.\nOn August 6, Judge Sowder issued a summary judgement dismissing Leach's lawsuits against ESPN, Spaeth Communications, and Craig James. Leach's attorneys indicated they would appeal.\nPost-Texas Tech.\nIn August 2010, Leach joined CBS College Sports Network, where he worked as a color analyst with play-by-play announcer Roger Twibell.\nIn 2010, Leach joined host Jack Arute to co-host \"College Football Playbook\" on SiriusXM College Sports Nation Channel 91, which airs weekdays 12 pm – 3 pm ET.\nIn 2011, Leach released an autobiographical book, \"Swing Your Sword: Leading the Charge in Football and in Life\", through Diversion Books. The book debuted at number six on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nLeach was considered by many in the national media to be a candidate for the head coaching vacancies at University of Miami, University of Maryland, and University of Minnesota following the 2010 regular season. After at least two interviews at Maryland, he was considered the frontrunner for that job until the administration decided instead to hire Randy Edsall away from UConn. Leach was mentioned in connection with a number of other vacancies in head-coaching positions during 2011, including Washington State, Arizona, Ole Miss, Kansas, Penn State, and Tulane.\nWashington State.\nLeach agreed to terms with Washington State on November 30, 2011, and began coaching for the 2012 season. His five-year rollover contract made Leach the fourth-highest paid coach in the Pac-12. On December 5, 2019, Leach received a contract extension through 2024.\n2012 season.\nLeach's first season in Pullman was a controversial one. Washington State was 3–9 overall and 1–8 in Pac-12 play; the lone wins were against FCS Eastern Washington, UNLV, and an upset of rival Washington in the Apple Cup in Pullman. On November 10, more allegations of player abuse erupted when star wide receiver Marquess Wilson quit the team citing \"physical, emotional and verbal abuse\" by the coaching staff. Immediately after the allegations were made, university president Elson Floyd issued a statement indicating that he had requested investigations into the alleged incident(s) from both the WSU Athletic Department and the Pac-12 Conference. The investigations determined that the claims made against Leach were without merit, and Wilson later recanted the allegations. Leach received a 2-year contract extension on November 18, 2013, after leading the Washington State Cougars to their best record since 2006.\n2013 season.\nLeach led WSU to a 6–6 regular season in 2013 that had them bowl eligible for the first time in a decade. They were led on offense by Connor Halliday, who set school and conference records for passing. The Cougars defeated USC, California, Arizona, and Utah for a conference record. Invited to the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque, WSU led most of the game, but lost to the Colorado State Rams. Down by sixteen points with under three minutes to play, the Rams mounted an all-time great comeback, winning with a field goal as time expired in regulation. The Cougars led the nation in passing offense and total offense and Leach was awarded a pay raise for the Cougars' 2013 performance.\n2014 season.\nThe 2014 season saw the Cougars regress to a record. The Cougars defeated Portland State Utah and Oregon State \n2015 season.\nIn 2015, despite a season-opening loss to FCS school Portland State, the Cougars had their breakthrough season of the Leach era with a record, in the Pac-12. The Cougars were invited to the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, where they beat the Miami Hurricanes This was the best Cougar record since the 2003 team went \n2016 season.\nWSU began the 2016 season with two losses, but rallied off eight consecutive wins before dropping their final two games. The success of their season, led by Luke Falk at quarterback, landed them in the Holiday Bowl in San Diego where they lost to Minnesota of the Big Ten. WSU finished in the Pac-12, with notable wins over Oregon and #15 Stanford. It was the Cougars' best conference finish in thirteen seasons, but the bowl loss gave WSU an overall record of \n2017 season.\nWashington State was in the Pac-12 and 9–3 in 2017. They were again invited to the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Michigan State and finished overall.\n2018 season.\nLeach recruited graduate transfer Gardner Minshew at quarterback in time for the 2018 season and it paid big dividends. The Cougars won a school record-tying ten games, the first time they had won that many in the regular season since the Rose Bowl year of 2002. They also surged as high as seventh in major polling and went into the Apple Cup with a chance to clinch the Pac-12 North title and a shot at the Rose Bowl, but lost 28–15 to rival Washington in the snow in Pullman, a sixth consecutive loss to the Huskies. The Cougars were invited to the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio to play the Iowa State Cyclones of They won 28–26 for a school record 11th win.\n2019 season.\nAfter Minshew went to the NFL, Leach led Washington State to a 6–7 record in 2019. Notably, Leach and the Cougars lost to unranked UCLA 67–63 while ranked #19 going into the game. Washington State ended the regular season with Leach's seventh consecutive Apple Cup loss to Washington.\nMississippi State.\n2020 season.\nOn January 9, 2020, Leach agreed to be the head coach of the Mississippi State Bulldogs. His contract was reported to pay him $5 million annually. The season started with a 44–34 upset victory over no. 6 LSU, who had won the CFP National Championship the previous season. The team struggled the rest of the season, winning only two more games, 24–17 over Vanderbilt and 51–32 over Missouri, finishing the regular season at 3–7. Despite the losing record, the Bulldogs were invited to the Armed Forces Bowl, as the NCAA waived bowl eligibility requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mississippi State faced off against no. 24 Tulsa, defeating the Golden Hurricane 28–26 to finish with an overall record of 4–7.\n2021 season.\nLeach led the Bulldogs to a 7–5 record in the 2021 regular season. The season was highlighted with ranked victories over Texas A&amp;M, Kentucky, and Auburn. They qualified for the Liberty Bowl, where they lost 34–7 to Texas Tech.\n2022 season.\nLeach led the Bulldogs to a 8–4 record in the 2022 regular season. The Bulldogs recorded ranked victories over Texas A&amp;M and Ole Miss. Leach died before the team's bowl game, an eventual 19–10 victory over Illinois in the ReliaQuest Bowl.\nCoaching tree.\nAlthough he did not play college football, Leach played wide receiver under John McDougall, the longtime coach at Cody High School in Cody, Wyoming. Under Coach MacDougall, Cody played in two top division state championships while Leach was a student, winning one in 1976 in triple overtime against coach John Deti's Laramie Plainsmen.\nHead coaches under whom Leach served:\nAssistant coaches under Leach who became college head coaches:\nPlayers under Leach who became college or NFL head coaches:\nPersonal life.\nLeach was the oldest of six siblings. He and his wife, Sharon, were the parents of four children, along with three grandchildren.\nLeach was atypical among NCAA Division I head coaches in that he did not play college football.\nFamous among fans for his fascination with 18th-century pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack, Leach lectured his players on the history of pirates, and told them before games to \"swing their swords.\" His office had been described as a museum of pirate paraphernalia. Notably, his office at Washington State included a life-size statue of a singing pirate, a gift from basketball coaching legend Bob Knight, who had coached at Texas Tech for most of Leach's tenure at that school. In particular, Leach admired the teamwork exhibited by pirates:\nLeach spent time during each off-season pursuing non-sport interests. Besides pirates, he had studied topics such as Native American leader Geronimo, American pioneer Daniel Boone, grizzly bears, chimpanzees, whales, and American artist Jackson Pollock.\nLeach made a cameo appearance on the TV series \"Friday Night Lights\". In the show's fourth season, he portrayed a \"random loon\" at a gas station who implores a despondent coach Eric Taylor to \"swing your sword\" and \"find your inner pirate.\"\nDuring the spring of 2019, Leach co-taught a five-week seminar at Washington State, \"Insurgent Warfare and Football Strategies,\" alongside Washington politician Michael Baumgartner.\nDeath.\nOn December 11, 2022, Leach experienced an undisclosed health issue and was hospitalized in Jackson, Mississippi. That evening, \"Sports Illustrated\" reporter Ross Dellenger reported that Leach was in critical condition. \"The Clarion-Ledger\" reported that Leach had suffered a massive heart attack and had not received medical attention for 10 to 15 minutes, and had also suffered seizures that may have contributed to brain damage as a result. He died the following day at the age of 61. In a statement, Mississippi State gave the cause of death as \"complications due to a heart condition\"."

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2004 proceeded in keeping with rules enacted in 2001. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from recent players; Dennis Eckersley and Paul Molitor gained induction to the Hall.\nThe Veterans Committee did not hold an election; the 2001 rules changes provided that elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players (managers, umpires and executives) held every fourth year. The Committee held elections in 2003 in both categories, including players who were active no later than 1981. The next election for players was in 2005; elections in both categories would again be held in 2007.\nThe induction ceremonies were held on July 25 in Cooperstown, with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nThe BBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1984 or later, but not after 1998; the ballot included candidates from the 2003 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1998. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2004 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 6. The ballot consisted of 32 players; 506 ballots were cast, with 380 votes required for election. A total of 3314 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.55 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (25 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nThe newly eligible candidates included 17 All-Stars, five of whom were not on the ballot, who were selected a total of 52 times. While no player was selected more than ten times, Paul Molitor (seven times), Dave Stieb (seven), Dennis Eckersley (six) and Joe Carter (five) were selected five times or more. The field included two Cy Young Award winners (Eckersley and Doug Drabek), three MVPs (Eckersley, Terry Pendleton and Kevin Mitchell) and one Rookie of the Year (Jerome Walton).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Rafael Belliard, Greg Cadaret, Tony Castillo, Dave Clark, Joey Cora, Mike Devereaux, Erik Hanson, Xavier Hernandez, Chris Hoiles, Rex Hudler, Pete Incaviglia, Mark Lemke, Nelson Liriano, John Marzano, Tom Pagnozzi, Donn Pall, Mark Parent, Bob Patterson, Billy Ripken, Luis Rivera, Bip Roberts, Craig Shipley, Pete Smith, Bill Swift, Jerome Walton, David West, and Eddie Williams.\nNone of the newly-eligible candidates would appear on any future ballots. As expected, Eckersley and Molitor were elected on their first appearance; no other first-timer received the 5% of votes required to remain on the ballot.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nMurray Chass received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2003 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2003, and conferred in the summer 2004 ceremonies.)\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 15, 2003 in Chicago in conjunction with All-Star Game activities; the finalists were: Murray Chass, who covered the New York Yankees for \"The New York Times\"; Joe Goddard, who has long covered the Chicago Cubs and White Sox for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\"; and Bob Burnes, who covered the St. Louis Browns for the \"St. Louis Globe Democrat\". All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 17, Murray Chass was announced as the recipient, having received 280 votes out of the 438 ballots cast, with Goddard receiving 98 votes and Burnes receiving 60 .\nFord C. Frick Award.\nLon Simmons received the Ford C. Frick Award honoring a baseball broadcaster.\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the Veterans Committee for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two; more than 160 candidates were eligible.\nOn December 11, 2003, 10 finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: Ken Coleman, Jack Graney, Graham McNamee, Hal Totten, Gene Elston, France Laux and Ty Tyson. Three additional candidates – Joe Nuxhall, Dave Niehaus and Lon Simmons – were selected in voting by over 105,000 fans prior to November 2003 at the Hall's official website .\nOn February 26, Lon Simmons was announced as the 2004 recipient ; an original voice of the San Francisco Giants, as well as an announcer for the Oakland Athletics. He called games for 41 years before retiring following the 2002 season. He was selected in a January vote by a 20-member committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian), Curt Smith (historian) and Larry Stewart (\"Los Angeles Times\"). Committee members are asked to base the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans."

        "text": "Pierre Lacroix (August 3, 1948 – December 13, 2020) was a Canadian ice hockey executive. He was the president and general manager of the Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche from 1994 to 2006. After the Nordiques moved to Colorado in 1995, he built teams that won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1996 and 2001. He was posthumously inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2023 as a builder.\nExecutive and Management career.\nLacroix became president and general manager of the Quebec Nordiques in 1994, and followed the team to Denver a year later. He was known for his astute trades, such as his acquisition of Patrick Roy during the 1995–96 NHL season that led to a Cup that season and his trades for star defensemen Ray Bourque during the 1999–2000 NHL season and Rob Blake during the 2000–01 NHL season that also led to a Stanley Cup in 2001.\nOn March 8, 2006, a day before the NHL trade deadline, Pierre Lacroix traded goalie David Aebischer for 2002 Hart and Vezina trophy winner José Théodore. This trade was criticized in the local media at the time because Théodore was having a very bad season and was injured at the time of the trade. This criticism from media and fans continued at varying degrees throughout Théodore's short tenure with the Avalanche.\nOn May 12, 2006, Lacroix announced that he would be giving up his general manager duties and focusing solely on a new role as team president. On May 10, 2013, Lacroix announced that he was stepping down as president and would serve in an advisory role for the club.\nOn April 8, 2008, Lacroix was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame for his contributions to the Colorado Avalanche organization.\nPersonal life and death.\nLacroix was the father of two sons, including former NHL player Eric Lacroix. \nHe died from complications of COVID-19 in Las Vegas, on December 13, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nevada."

        "text": "South End Rowing Club is an athletic club and social club in San Francisco, California.\nThe South End Rowing Club, founded in 1873, is one of the oldest athletics clubs in the western United States. The boathouse, with a fleet of 30 boats, is located in San Francisco, California, near Fisherman's Wharf, adjacent to the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. The club supports participation in rowing, swimming, handball, and running.\nHistory.\nThe original boathouse was located in the South End neighborhood (subsequently torn down), near present-day AT&amp;T Park and Mission Bay. The boathouse was moved by barge to Aquatic Park in the early 1900s, and to its present location in 1938. Portions of the original boathouse remain a part of the club.\nThe South End Rowing Club maintains a fierce but friendly rivalry with its next-door neighbor, the Dolphin Club. The clubs hold an annual triathlon in rowing, swimming, and running. As of 2010, the South End Rowing Club has won the competition 29 of the past 31 years. The ladies' crew from the South End races its wooden barge against the ladies' crew from the Dolphin Club.\nEvery year since 1978 the South End Rowing Club has hosted the Bridge to Bridge Regatta in September. This race is open to the public, and typically includes singles and doubles, and plastic and wooden boats alike. The race courses vary from year to year, but there is typically a \"long course\" which starts at Aquatic Park and circumnavigates the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge and the westernmost tower San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, as well as a \"short course\" from Aquatic Park around the Bay Bridge tower and back.\nThe South End also hosts a yearly competitive swim from Alcatraz Island in San Francisco bay to the Aquatic Park, which is open to the public. The event is limited to 600 swimmers and reaches its capacity for registration months in advance."

        "text": "The Australia women's national field hockey team (nicknamed the Hockeyroos) are, as of August 2023, ranked second in the world. Having played their first game in 1914, and their first Olympic game in 1984, they are one of Australia's most successful sporting teams, boasting three Olympic gold medals (1988, 1996, 2000), two World Cup gold medals (1994, 1998) and four Commonwealth Games gold medals (1998, 2006, 2010, 2014). The Hockeyroos have been crowned Australia's Team of the Year five times and were unanimously awarded Best Australian Team at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\nA notable part of the Hockeyroos colourful history has involved Ric Charlesworth. Charlesworth was at the helm of the Hockeyroos from 1993 to 2000, where his reign as coach saw the team win the 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999 Champions Trophies, 1994 and 1998 World Cups and the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Charlesworth took the Hockeyroos to the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games, where the team won back-to-back gold medals. The team was coached from 2011 by Adam Commens, who was replaced after the 2016 Summer Olympics, where the side failed to medal, by Paul Gaudoin.\nAmid much turmoil, Gaudoin quit in March 2021 and was replaced by former player Katrina Powell.\nGiven the extent of the Hockeyroos success, the team has consistently remained at the top of the world hockey rankings. From the late 1980s until 2000, the Australian team was ranked at number 1 in the world. Only once during this period, did the Hockeyroos fail to win a tournament, when they finished fifth.\nGreat Hockeyroos.\nRechelle Hawkes.\nAs part of the Olympic team in 1988, 1992, 1996 and 2000, Rechelle Hawkes is the most decorated Hockeyroo of all time. Such is her status in international hockey that she is among the most successful female players in the history of the sport.\nHawkes is the only female hockey player to win three Olympic gold medals at three separate games. After 279 international matches,\nHawkes retired following the Sydney Olympic Games where the Hockeyroos again won gold. In recognition of her contribution to\nAustralian sport, Rechelle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2018, Hawkes was made a Member of the Order of Australia for \"significant service to hockey.\"\nAlyson Annan.\nAlyson Annan is also one of more prominent figures in the history of the Hockeyroos. Annan debuted in the Australian side at the age of 18 and became renowned for her prowess in front of goal, scoring 166 goals during her career. She was widely regarded as the sharpest shooter in international women's hockey during the 1990s which was acknowledged when she won the World Hockey Player of the Year in 1999. Annan represented Australia 228 times, and was part of the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Gold Medal-winning teams. Annan remains the Hockeyroos highest goal scorer.\nNikki Hudson.\nAs a highly recognised Hockeyroo, Nikki Hudson has become one of the most identifiable Australian athletes. Retiring in 2009, the striker was formerly the highest capped player in the history of the Hockeyroos, finishing on 303 games (at the time, being the only Hockeyroo to play over 300 games). Since her debut in 1993 at the age of 17, Hudson scored 99 goals in international competition. In 2008, she played in her third successive Olympic Games.\nMadonna Blyth.\nFollowing her debut in 2004, Madonna Blyth became one of the most prominent Hockeyroos in history. Retiring in 2016, the midfielder became the highest-capped player in the history of the Hockeyroos, finishing on 342 games, surpassing the record previously set by Nikki Hudson. During her career, she won three Commonwealth Games gold medals and two World Cup silvers. She was also the captain of the team from 2009 until her retirement in 2016, following the Olympic Games.\nThe Hockeyroos since 2016.\nFollowing the 2016 Summer Olympics, many of the Hockeyroos' core players retired, forcing the team into a development phase. In 2017, long-time player Emily Chalker was named captain of the team during this rebuilding phase. Following a disappointing Hockey World League campaign, the team won the Oceania Cup, sparking what would become a string of successes for the team.\nThe Hockeyroos played three major tournaments in 2018, winning silver medals at the Commonwealth Games and Champions Trophy. The team only failed to medal at the World Cup, where they finished fourth.\nFollowing her return to the squad in 2018, Jodie Kenny was named as a co-captain of the team, along with Emily Chalker and Georgina Morgan. The team started 2019 with an historic 1–0 victory over world number one, the Netherlands in the FIH Pro League, this marked their first win over the Dutch since the 2009 Champions Trophy. At the conclusion of the group stage of the FIH Pro League, the Hockeyroos finished in third place, qualifying for the Grand Final and the FIH Olympic Qualifiers.\nTeam.\n2024 squad.\nThe following 21 players were named in the Hockeyroos squad for the 2024 International Festival of Hockey in Perth.\nHead coach: Katrina Powell\nThe remainder of the national squad is as follows:\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have received call-ups to the national team in the last 12 months:\nOther programs.\nNational development squad.\nIn addition to the core 22 player squad, Hockey Australia also maintains a 20 player development squad. The 2024 squad is as follows:\nResults.\nIn April 2024, the development squad will play Australia, China and Japan in the International Festival of Hockey."

        "text": "Australian Rugby League is a 1995 rugby league video game developed by I-Space Interactive and published by EA's EA Sports label for the Mega Drive only in European and Australian markets. It is based on Rugby World Cup '95 by Creative Assembly, but using the rugby league rules instead of rugby union.\nIn addition to the league that names the game, the Australian Rugby League, the game also includes the State of Origin, Super League (eleven English teams plus one French) and international mode. While the ARL has all correct team names, player names are fictitious.\nGameplay.\nDue to the limitations of the console, \"ARL\" presents a simplified version of the game, yet allowing a wide variety of moves. Running is done with the C button, and while holding allows a player to accelerate, while it is mashed, it allows to break a tackle. Passing is done by pressing the B button with a direction; if no direction is entered, the player fakes a pass. the A button, if pressed inside the try area (or in jump distance), grounds the ball, if far and pressed in combination of the direction of the attack attempts a drop goal or kicks for touch, if pressed in combination with a direction \"against\" the attack, performs a grubber kick. The A and B buttons pressed at the same time perform a bomb kick (referred as \"Up and Under\" in the manual), and an A plus C combination is mostly a defensive kick, which clears the ball as far away as possible into touch. Without the ball, controls are simpler: the A button tackles, the B changes player and C increases player speed.\nThe game has a few criticisms; it is very undisciplined as far as tactics go, it is very hard to pull good kicks during play (which forces players to, and the lack of a difficulty level slider makes the game too easy for expert players. There are also some bugs regarding ball possession (occasionally, the ball can change from one team to another in the middle of a play for no reason at all) and the engine often flickers players when there are too many of them in an area. The lack of physical difference between forwards and backs is also often mentioned.\n\"ARL\" allows several options to be tweaked, such as half length (from two minutes to 40), temperature (hot temperatures wear out the players quicker, while colder affects ball handling) and pitch condition (a dry pitch hurts tackled players more and bounces the ball more, while drenched affects running).\nTeams and leagues.\nAll game modes output a Password which allows the player to play a league in several sittings. Each player is individualized, and is rated in each key aspect of the game.\nThe Australian Rugby league is a 20 team competition composed by a 20 team league, then followed by an eight team playoff, which is far from being straight forward. There are two sets of quarter finals, where the winners of the \"major\" quarterfinals go through the semi-finals, while the winners of the \"minor\" quarterfinals have to play against the losers of the \"majors\", and only then the remaining two semi-finalists are known. It is also possible to start from the playoffs.\nState of Origin is a three match series between New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League, where the winner is the first team to win two matches. Even if a team beats the other in the first two matches, the third is always played.\nEuropean leagues are unlicensed, which means they only carry the city name and a patterned flag, which in most cases fits the actual equipments of the teams. After the all vs all league, the best four teams enter a playoff to determine the champions.\nThe International tournament is a one-legged eight team knockout competition. While the focus of \"RWC'95\" was on national teams, \"ARL\" downplays it to the point of only including eight teams."

The WSOP ToC has been played intermittently five times in the 21st Century with different formats. The four WSOP ToC events held from 2004-2010 did not count as official WSOP bracelets events, with the winners receiving instead a large trophy in the shape of the official World Series of Poker logo. In 2010, the WSOP Tournament of Champions returned with a new format more akin to a typical sports league All-Star Event format. 27 players vied for $1 million, with 20 of those players selected by the fans via online vote at the WSOP's website. Controversies over the inclusion of commercially sponsored players resulted in a hiatus in the WSOP ToC for over a decade. The WSOP ToC was reintroduced in 2022 as an official WSOP bracelet event. \nResults.\n2004.\nThe first event took place on 1 September 2004 with invitations only being extended to ten of the most well-known names on the poker tournament circuit at the time. The winner took home a $2,000,000 prize. No other participants received prize money. \n2005.\nThe 2005 event took place between November 6 and November 8 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.\nPrior to the event, Harrah's advertised that to qualify a player would need to reach the final table of the 2005 World Series of Poker $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em championship event, or win any World Series of Poker Circuit event.\nControversy erupted however when Pepsi, the event's sponsor, insisted that Phil Hellmuth, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Chan be granted Sponsor Exemptions. Despite public protests from other players that they were lied to as the event was billed as one that one had to qualify for, ESPN and Harrah's newly hired Vice President of Sports and Entertainment Marketing, Jeffrey Pollack allowed the three to participate. Hellmuth finished third, while Chan and Brunson missed the final table, coming in 13th and 10th, respectively.\nFrom 2006 onward, Harrah's reserved the right to let in up to six players via sponsor's exemptions.\n2006.\nThe 2006 field of twenty-seven players included the 9 players who made the final table of the 2005 World Series of Poker main event, the winners of the 11 WSOP Circuit events in the preceding calendar year, and some sponsor exemptions. \n2005 World Series of Poker Main Event Final Table Players:\nWSOP Circuit Event Winners:\nSponsor Exemptions:\n2007.\nHarrah's put the Tournament of Champions on hold indefinitely.\n2010.\nOn March 15, 2010, Harrah's and the World Series of Poker announced that the WSOP Tournament of Champions would return on June 27, 2010 when 27 players competed in a freeroll for $1 million in prize money. The new format is an All-Star Event format, where the public decided which players participated in the event from a list of 521 current WSOP bracelet-holders.\nThe public decided the 20 players via an online vote at www.WSOP.com/TOC. Voting was open from March 15, 2010 until midnight ET on June 15, 2010.\nVoted in were: Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu, Doyle Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Chris Ferguson, Allen Cunningham, Johnny Chan, Scotty Nguyen, Barry Greenstein, John Juanda, Erik Seidel, Jennifer Harman, Huck Seed, Dan Harrington, T. J. Cloutier, Sammy Farha, Howard Lederer, Greg Raymer, Joe Hachem and Antonio Esfandiari.\nFive of the seats were automatically awarded. The reigning WSOP Champion Joe Cada, the reigning WSOP Europe Champion Barry Shulman and the three previous TOC winners: Annie Duke, Mike Matusow and Mike Sexton.\nThe remaining two seats were awarded as sponsor exemptions by Harrah's, to Andrew Barton and Bertrand \"Elky\" Grospellier.\nOn June 27, the 27 players began play in the Amazon Room at the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. The final nine players returned to play the final table on July 4, 2010 in the same location.\n2022.\nIn 2022, the WSOP ToC was reintroduced to automatically include the season's winners of all WSOP Circuit Events played at regional casinos and online, as well as WSOP bracelet winners in Las Vegas from the previous year. 470 Champions out of an eligible 569 qualifiers participated in the 2022 WSOP ToC.

Hull fought back with a try from Motu Tony converted by Danny Brough. Hull took the lead for the first time through Gareth Raynor's try in the corner after a superb pass by Nathan Blacklock. Brough converted brilliantly to make the score 12–6. Leeds fought back and a try from Danny Ward was converted by Sinfield to draw the scores level.

By 1897 the BGA had a full nine holes in play at 52nd Street and Chester Avenue, its first location, in what is today Southwest Philadelphia. Playing to a length of 3,069 yards, par for the course was established at 36½. In that same year, the BGA was the first and only founding club to host its own championship. The tournament was won by Hugh Wilson who designed Merion's golf courses.\nHistory has it that Aronimink was named after the chief of the Lenape tribe who once occupied the small farmhouse being used as the original clubhouse. From inception to the mid-1920s, as the City of Philadelphia continued to expand, Aronimink operated from three different sites. Finally, in 1926 the club sold its Drexel Hill location and purchased a large tract in Newtown Square, from the center of Philadelphia. \nScottish-born Donald Ross, at the time one of the country's most respected golf course architects, was commissioned to design the new course, which opened for play on Memorial Day in 1928. The greens, fairways and hazards of his championship course design are the same today as they were in 1928. The Club's impressive British-inspired clubhouse was designed by architects Charles Barton Keen and Franklin D. Edmonds, a member of the club. \nAronimink has been home to many accomplished golfers in its history. The first American-born winner of the U.S. Open, John McDermott, was an Aronimink caddie who learned to play golf from Aronimink's longtime head golf professional, Walter Reynolds. Notable members from the modern era of golf include: Gary Player (an honorary member since 2003), Sean O'Hair (PGA professional and home-town favorite) and Jay Sigel (the distinguished amateur and senior professional golfer). Currently, Aronimink's head golf professional is Jeff Kiddie.\nAronimink gained media notoriety when it withdrew itself from plans to host the 1993 PGA Championship because it didn't have any current or prospective African-American members or applicants before the start of the tournament. The club has since met all of the PGA's minority membership requirements and has hosted both a Senior PGA and a USGA event since 1993, with the Women's PGA scheduled in October 2020.\nGolf course: design and layout.\nAronimink embodies many of the principles that guided Donald Ross's approach to golf course design, which was rooted in the linksland golf of his native Scotland. To Ross it was important that the lay of the land have an effect on the ball being played – adding an element of chance to the game and enhancing the golfer's sense of excitement and anticipation. He incorporated hazards to present challenges and risks, and to protect par he was particularly clever around the greens with his bunkering and designs for the greens, which offered numerous challenging pin positions. \nIn 2003, Ron Prichard, a noted golf architect from the Philadelphia area and the foremost authority on Ross's design philosophy, completed a restoration project at Aronimink that recaptured classic Ross features that had been diminished and/or lost over time. Panoramic views were restored by eliminating overplanting. Based on Ross's original drawings for the course, greens were restored to their original shapes and sizes, and his unique bunkering style was reestablished. Length was added to neutralize the effect technology has had on golf and brought Ross's unique design features back into play in quite an effective fashion.\nWith the restoration, Donald Ross's Aronimink plays as he intended it to. As he said in 1948, two decades after the course opened, \"I intended to make this my masterpiece, but not until today did I realize built better than I knew.\" \nRoss's design rewards well executed shots and strategy for golfers at all skill levels. Framed by hardwoods and evergreens, the course is a test of long-hole and short-hole skills, as well as the execution of sound course management. With 75 bunkers and numerous slopes, valleys and doglegs, the course tests a player's patience and endurance. Ross meant Aronimink to be a “supreme test” for the best golfers. From the championship tees, Aronimink's course is and plays to a par of 70. \nAronimink's opening hole is one of the most memorable in golf. The intimidating first hole plunges down into a valley, then rises steeply, playing long and uphill to a well-guarded undulating green. \nOn the front nine there are a number of challenging doglegs, particularly the par four #7. Although not a long hole, the approach must carry a yawning bunker guarding the front of a green with several difficult pin locations. Then there is #8, perhaps the hardest par three on the course, playing downhill to a narrow green bisected by a large mound. \nThe turn for home at Aronimink begins with #10, a par four that is considered by many the most demanding on the course. The narrow fairway is guarded by a bunker on the right and deep rough on the left. A successful approach shot must avoid the water hazard protecting the front left of the sharply terraced green.\nIn 2003, John Jacobs birdied the last two holes to win the Senior PGA Championship. The 17th is a par three. An errant tee shot often finds the lake guarding the green. The finishing hole is a uphill par four, requires a precise tee shot and the approach shot is to a winding and sloped green with a numerous challenging pin locations.\nPast and future tournaments.\nWhen the PGA Championship was held at Aronimink in 1962, Gary Player prevailed as he posted a score of 278 (−2). In 1977, John Fought needed only 28 holes to win the final match in the U.S. Amateur – 9 &amp; 8 – over Doug Fischesser. In the 1997 U.S. Junior Amateur, Jason Allred defeated Trevor Immelman in the final match, one-up. In 2003, John Jacobs won the Senior PGA Championship with a score 276 (−4). Justin Rose won the 2010 AT&amp;T National with a final score of 270 (−10), after needing pars at both the 71st and 72nd holes to win. The following year Nick Watney defeated the field with a bogey-free round on Sunday – after setting the course record of 62 (−8) on Saturday – for a score of 267 (−13)."

They occur in northern Mexico (Coahuila), the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and in southern Ontario, Canada.\nThey are more aquatic than other members of the family, and are generally associated with permanent bodies of water with surface vegetation. This is a quite important aspect of their survival, as adult cricket frogs suffer high mortality rates when submerged in poorly oxygenated water (typically less than 24 hours on average in water that is ~1.2 mg/L). The common and scientific names refer to their call, which resembles that of a cricket. The two common species are \"A. crepitans\" and \"A. gryllus\". \"A. crepitans\" are found in mesic woodlands as well as xeric grasslands, whereas \"A. gryllus\" are concentrated in mesic woodlands.\nCricket frogs are able to communicate and attract each other using a specific frequency of their mating call, that sounds like a cricket. It can only be heard by members of the same population. Cricket frogs from other locales are unable to aurally process other calls, leading to mating isolation among the species.\nSpecies.\nThere are three species:"

        "text": "Brian Carney (born 23 July 1976) is an Irish professional rugby league commentator and former dual-code rugby international player. He most recently played rugby league for Warrington Wolves, but he also played for Gateshead Thunder, Hull F.C. and Wigan Warriors in the Super League, as well as Newcastle Knights in the NRL. Carney crossed codes to play rugby union for Munster between 2007 and 2009. He earned caps for international representation, for Ireland in both rugby league and rugby union, and also Great Britain and Ireland in rugby league. He also played Gaelic football as a junior.\nCarney is one of the presenters for Sky's coverage of Gaelic games which started in June 2014. \nEarly life.\nCarney played Gaelic football for Valleymount GAA in west county Wicklow and won a junior championship medal in 1998 with the club. He also played rugby union at Clongowes Wood College and Lansdowne R.F.C. His first rugby league experience came with Irish amateurs Dublin Blues.\nRugby league.\nCarney first made an impression on the rugby league scene playing for the Irish Students side in a home international tournament in 1998. His impressive form led to a number of Super League clubs vying for his talents and he opted to sign with Gateshead Thunder.\nSuper League.\nCarney played for Gateshead in the 1999 season and moved with them to Hull F.C. after the clubs merged in 2000.\nCarney transferred from Hull F.C. to Wigan at the end of the 2000 Super League season. He had come to the attention of the Wigan board – who were very impressed with him – when he scored a try against Wigan in Gateshead's Super League on the Road victory at Tynecastle. Future Wigan scrum-half Willie Peters, also shone in the same match. Since making the professional ranks, Carney, who is a qualified lawyer, was a regular in the senior colours of Ireland and featured heavily in the Lincoln Financial World Cup of 2000. Carney played for Wigan on the wing in their 2001 Super League Grand Final loss against Bradford.\nCarney signed a new three-year contract with Wigan in May 2003, ending speculation that had been linking him with a move to Irish rugby union. After signing the deal, Carney commented: \"I love it here at Wigan. I never wanted to play for any other club. I just want to get better and better each week and keep my place in the first team. The spirit and friendship at this club is brilliant and I need to be part of it.\" His arrival at Wigan was initially hampered by injury but when he did break into the team, he was impressive. Carney played for Wigan on the wing in the 2003 Super League Grand Final which was lost to Bradford. He'd forced himself into the Great Britain team for the 2003 Ashes series. Carney made his GB and Ireland début in the First Test played at the JJB Stadium, becoming the first Irishman to play for Great Britain and Ireland since Tom McKinney in 1957. In that match Carney scored two tries and was later named Great Britain and Ireland's player of the series. Carney was selected for the 2003 Origin match after opting to play for Lancashire. He was also included in the 2003 Super League 'Dream Team' and the 2003 Rugby League World magazine World XIII, and voted BBC North West's Rugby League Footballer of the Year in the same season.\nDespite a hamstring injury restricting his club appearances, Carney was selected in the Great Britain team to compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he played on the wing in the Lions' 44–4 loss.\nNational Rugby League.\nIn June 2005 Carney agreed to join new National Rugby League franchise team, Australia's Gold Coast Titans, at the end of his Wigan contract. Upon signing the deal, Gold Coast managing director Michael Searle told NRL's official website, www.nrl.com: \"The guy genuinely wanted to come here. He wants to challenge himself in the National Rugby League\".\nCarney was to remain at Wigan for the 2006 season, but a month later he agreed a release from the final year of his Wigan contract to play in the NRL with Newcastle. At the time Carney commented: \"I'm very grateful to Wigan, they didn't have to do it (release him from his contract) but I explained my desire to get there because I feel time is running out.\" Carney made his debut for the Newcastle club at the age of , making him the oldest player in the NRL era (since 1998) to make his first grade debut. Carney scored 16 tries in 26 games for Newcastle, including guiding his team to a 22–12 victory over the Canberra Raiders with a hat-trick of tries. After the game Carney expressed no desire to remain with the Newcastle club, choosing to honour his contract with the Gold Coast. However, on 16 January 2007 he announced his retirement from all forms of rugby after only participating in one training session with the Gold Coast, indicating that he wished to finish his legal studies and spend more time with his family.\nRugby union.\nOn Thursday 15 March 2007, BBC Sport reported that Carney had signed for Munster, switching to rugby union, with speculation rife that he would be fast-tracked onto Ireland's team for its tour of Argentina in summer 2007. Because he had walked out on his contract with the Gold Coast Titans, Munster had to pay compensation to the Australian club to secure Carney's registration. Carney made his début for Munster, against Ulster at Ravenhill on 23 March 2007, scoring a try in the 76th minute. He scored his second try in two matches in an away loss to Ospreys on 7 April. In April 2007, Carney was named in the Ireland squad for their tour of Argentina. In the first Test, Carney's rugby union international début, he scored an interception try minutes into the game. \nCarney was selected in the Irish squad for the 2007 Rugby Union World Cup. However, he did not make an appearance at the tournament.\nCarney made a try-scoring début for the Barbarians against the Scarlets on 31 January 2009. He participated in the Dubai World Cup Sevens as part of a 12-man Irish squad, finishing up as joint-highest Irish try scorer with three tries. Though Ireland was in a tough pool stage, including Samoa, Australia, and Portugal, Ireland did manage to defeat Australia 24–21, with Carney getting a try. He scored two more tries in the Bowl semi-final victory over Hong Kong. They went on to lose 17–14 to Zimbabwe in the Bowl Final, for an overall ranking of 10th.\nReturn to rugby league.\nOn 2 June 2009, the Warrington Wolves announced that they had signed Carney for the remainder of 2009's Super League XIV. The move was Carney's fifth signing to a rugby league team in his playing career, at the age of 32. On 2 June 2009 edition of the Sky Sports rugby league magazine show, \"Boots N' All\", Carney vehemently denied that a return to rugby league would lead to a subsequent career with the England national team, in favour of his own native team. Carney provided commentary for Sky Sport's coverage of the 2009 Super League Grand Final, and the 2009 Gillette Four Nations tournament. He finished his career at Warrington at the end of 2009 and regularly appears on Sky Sports."

        "text": "Ailo Mikkelsen Gaup (born 22 January 1979 in Tromsø, Norway) is a former Norwegian Freestyle Motocross rider, who invented the Underflip. Gaup has won the world title in FMX. Gaup originally started his career competing in motocross, but switched to FMX competitions. He announced his retirement in October 2009.\nEarly years.\nAilo was born in Tromsø to parents Mikkel Aslaksen Gaup and author Laila Stien and grew up there and in Máze (Masi) in Kautokeino municipality. His family moved to Alta when Ailo was fourteen years old. As a ten-year-old he sold fish and painted houses to be able to buy a mini-motorcycle and began motorcross cycling. As a sixteen-year-old, he moved to the capital of Oslo to enroll in the motorcross line at The Norwegian College of Elite Sport in Bærum.\nCareer.\nToday, Ailo lives in Kongsberg, where he has been located since 2000. He started competing in freestyle motocross in 1999 and won the Norwegian Championship. In 2002 Ailo entered his first international freestyle motocross contest and ended up second overall at his first World Cup contest.\nAilo was the first European to perform a backflip on a motorcycle, in 2003. He was also the first European do long distance backflips, a year later. \nIn November 2004 Ailo invented the Underflip, which is a sideways flip on a motorcycle. It took almost two years until anyone else was able to perform this trick. The Underflip has later been copied by riders all over the world.\nGaup has to date won six Norwegian Championships in two different sports, motocross and freestyle motocross/FMX, and won the World Cup in 2003 and 2004. He was crowned World Cup Champion in FMX in 2004 and again in 2007, making him the only rider to win the World Championships in freestyle motocross twice.\nHe has stated that in spite of his profession, he is scared of heights.\nOn 17 November 2007 he became the first Norwegian and the first Sámi to win a gold medal in FMX.\nAs many of his relatives, Ailo has also done some acting. He played Ryzard, a gymnast in a small circus in the movie \"Dobbel Salto\" in 2005. He also plays the young version of the main character Eivind, in \"Jernanger\"."

        "title": "Duck (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a duck is a batsman's dismissal with a score of zero. A batsman being dismissed off their first delivery faced is known as a golden duck.\nEtymology.\nThe term is a shortening of the term \"duck's egg\", the latter being used long before Test cricket began. When referring to the Prince of Wales' (the future Edward VII) score of nought on 17 July 1866, a contemporary newspaper wrote that the Prince \"retired to the royal pavilion on a 'duck's egg' \". The name is believed to come from the shape of the number \"0\" being similar to that of a duck's egg, as in the case of the American slang term \"goose-egg\" popular in baseball and the tennis term \"love\", derived – according to one theory – from French \"l'œuf\" (\"the egg\"). The Concise Oxford Dictionary still cites \"duck's egg\" as an alternative version of the term.\nSignificant ducks.\nThe first duck in a Test match was made in the first Test, between Australia and England at Melbourne in March 1877, when Ned Gregory was caught by Andrew Greenwood off the bowling of James Lillywhite.\nAs of 2017, the record for the most ducks in Test cricket is held by West Indies player Courtney Walsh, who was out for nought on 43 occasions,\nwhile the overall first-class record is 156, set by Worcestershire and England player Reg Perks.\nOne particularly high-profile example of a duck came in 1948, when Don Bradman was playing his final Test match for Australia, against England at The Oval. In Australia's first innings, Bradman was bowled for a duck by Eric Hollies, causing his Test average to fall from 101.39 to 99.94; had he scored just four runs, his average would have been 100. As things turned out, Australia won the match by an innings, and so Bradman did not get to bat a second time (had he batted, he would have needed at least 104 runs if dismissed or at least four runs if not out to get his average back to 100).\nIn the first Test of Australia's tour of India in 1986, with the cumulative scores tied, Indian tailender Maninder Singh was trapped LBW by Greg Matthews for a four ball duck, ensuring just the second tied Test in Test Cricket history.\nIndian all-rounder Ajit Agarkar earned the unfortunate nickname \"Bombay Duck\" after being dismissed for ducks five consecutive times in test matches against Australia.\nIn a 1913 match against Glastonbury, Huish and Langport's batsmen all scored ducks for a total of zero runs. A similar occurrence in indoor cricket happened in 2016, when Bapchild Cricket Club were dismissed for zero against Christ Church University.\nVariations.\nThere are several variations used to describe specific types of duck. The usage or prevalence of many of these terms vary regionally, with one term having different meanings in different parts of the world. Even within commentary from ESPN Cricinfo or individual cricket board websites, there is no uniform application of some of these terms.\nPair.\nTo be dismissed for nought in both innings of the same two-innings match is to be dismissed for a pair,\nbecause the two noughts together are thought to resemble a pair of spectacles; the longer form is occasionally used. To be dismissed first ball in \"both\" innings (\"i.e.\", two golden ducks) is to suffer the indignity of making a \"king pair\".\nRelated expressions.\nTwo consecutive pairs, or, more generally, four consecutive ducks, are referred to as an \"Audi\". The expression alludes to the German car manufacturer, the logo of which is four linked rings. A player who has been dismissed for three consecutive ducks and not yet scored in a further consecutive innings is said to be \"on an Audi\".\nIn 1992, Australian batter Mark Waugh scored successive Test pairs against Sri Lanka, and was given the temporary nickname \"Audi\". In 2023, Australian wicket-keeper-batter Alyssa Healy almost completed a Test Audi when she feathered a ball from Kate Cross towards Amy Jones during a Women's Ashes match at Trent Bridge, but Jones did not take the proffered catch, and Healy went on to score an even 50.\nA player who has completed an Audi and is yet to score in yet another consecutive innings is said to be \"on an Olympic\", an expression alluding to the five interlocking \"Olympic rings\". In Test cricket, three players have completed an Olympic: Bob Holland (1985), Ajit Agarkar (1999–2000) and Mohammad Asif (2006)."

        "title": "Tom Rees (rugby union, born 1984)",
        "text": "Thomas Rees (born 11 September 1984) is an ex-international rugby union footballer who played flanker for London Wasps and represented England at senior, Under-21, Under-19, Under-18 and Under-16 levels as well as sevens. He announced his retirement due to persistent injuries on 10 March 2012.\nCareer.\nBorn 11 September 1984 in London, Rees began playing rugby at Harriet Costello Secondary School (now The Costello School) in 1996. He also joined the youth team at Basingstoke RFC the following year. Under the guidance of Andy Bloodworth (of Chineham RFC) and Dave Luff, Rees progressed in the sport, initially playing in the centre before eventually specialising at openside flanker. Rees was eventually selected for England U16s, where he was awarded player of the year, and which led to his receiving offers from many Rugby-playing grammar schools: he chose to attend The Royal Grammar School in High Wycombe. Rees went on to play for England U18s and then U19s, being the first-choice openside flanker in both sides. He then signed for London Wasps on an academy contract, and after two years and having just broken into the first team, he was offered a first team contract, which he re-signed on a two-year deal.\nWith Wasps he won both the Heineken Cup in 2007 and the 2008 Guinness Premiership title, scoring a try in the latter final.\nHe returned to action on 27 March 2010 against Northampton, which ended 14 9 to Northampton but this followed wins over Gloucester, Worcester and London Irish.\nOn 10 March 2012, Rees was forced to retire from Rugby on the advice he received after sustaining a knee injury.\nAs of May 2020, Rees is a doctor at Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital, having studied at Imperial College London.\nRepresentative career.\nRees captained the England U21 side in the Six Nations Championship but was not selected for the elite England squad for the 2005 autumn internationals due to a knee injury sustained during the 2005 Zurich Premiership semi-finals.\nRees represented England A against Ireland A in early 2006.\nRees had a string of injuries during the 2005–06 season, but on his return put in strong performances at Wasps and was granted his place in the full England squad after representing England at all age groups possible.\nRees made his full England debut on 3 February 2007 against Scotland, coming on as a substitute for Joe Worsley. Rees started his first game in the 26–18 victory against France on 11 March 2007 and was awarded the RBS Man of The Match Award by Brian Moore. Rees also started the next game against Wales.\nRees made his World Cup debut in England's initial group game against USA. Despite England under performing Rees was signalled out along with back Olly Barkley as two positives from the victory. Rees' second half try in that game put him second behind Nigel Redman as England's youngest try scoring forward during a World Cup Finals event. Despite starting in the following game against South Africa Rees failed to make another appearance during the 2007 World Cup. A thigh injury kept him out of the matches against Tonga and Samoa and during this time Lewis Moody claimed the number 7 shirt for the remainder of the tournament.\nDespite a supposed lack of form for his club side London Wasps since his return from the World Cup, Rees made Brian Ashton's 32-man training squad for the 2008 Six Nations and earned a place on the bench for the Six Nations opener against Wales ahead of other open-side specialists Michael Lipman and Magnus Lund.\nRees' strong form towards the end of the 2007–08 Guinness Premiership saw him selected to travel to New Zealand to represent England in a two-test summer tour. He was then selected to start the first test at number 7 on 14 June 2008, a game which England lost 37–20. Despite England's defeat, Rees had put in a decent performance in that match. Rees was picked to start the second test in Christchurch on 21 June 2008. England were thumped 44–12; however, Rees again put in a performance he could be proud of against the standout openside in world rugby, Richie McCaw. If Rees' career had not been cut short, he exhibited the potential to make the No.7 shirt his own. There is no doubt the England management would have been compelled to recognise Tom's natural ability as a player and a leader, enhancing the national team's strength and solving the No.7 debate."

        "text": "The UEFA Champions League is a seasonal football competition established in 1955. Prior to the 1992–93 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. The UEFA Champions League is open to the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), as well as to the clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champions of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible. In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.\nTeams that have won the UEFA Champions League three consecutive times, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge. Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona. Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned; since 2009, the winning team each year has received a full-size replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA.\nA total of 23 clubs have won the Champions League/European Cup. Real Madrid hold the record for the most victories, having won the competition fourteen times, including the inaugural edition. They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atlético Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with nineteen wins from two clubs. England have produced fifteen winners from a record six clubs and Italy have produced twelve winners from three clubs. English teams were banned from the competition for five years following the Heysel disaster in 1985. The current champions are Manchester City, who beat Inter Milan 1–0 in the 2023 final.\nPerformances.\nBy nation.\nTeams from thirteen nations have appeared in a Champions League final, and teams from ten of those have won the competition. Since the 1995–96 season, other than Porto's win in 2003–04, the winners have come from one of only four nations – Spain (12), England (7), Germany (4) and Italy (4) – and other than Monaco in 2003–04 and Paris Saint-Germain in 2019–20, the runners-up have all come from the same four nations.\nEngland has produced the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the trophy. Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands have produced three winners, while Spain and Portugal have produced two winning clubs. Scotland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and France have produced one winner each. \n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

Real Madrid's run started with a 1–1 draw in the second leg of their semi-final tie against Barcelona on 3 May 2011. This run continued into the entirety of the next two seasons, with Madrid scoring in all twelve matches of both their 2011–12 and 2012–13 Champions League campaigns. The club then scored in the first nine games of their 2013–14 campaign (six group stage games, both legs of the round of 16 and the first leg of the quarter-finals), with the run coming to an end following a 2–0 away loss against Borussia Dortmund in the second leg of the quarter-finals on 8 April 2014.\nParis Saint-Germain's run started with a 1–1 group stage draw against Arsenal on 13 September 2016. This streak continued with PSG scoring at least once in all 24 matches played over the course of their 2016–17, 2017–18 and 2018–19 Champions League campaigns (including all six group stage games and both legs of the round of 16). The club then scored in all six group stage games, both legs of the round of 16, and the single-legged quarter-finals and semi-finals of the 2019–20 edition, with their run ending in the final following a 0–1 defeat to Bayern Munich on 23 August 2020.\nConsecutive home wins.\nBayern Munich hold the record of 21 consecutive home wins in the European Cup era. The run began with a 2–0 win against Saint-Étienne in the first leg of the 1969–70 first round. The run ended with a 1–1 draw to Liverpool in the second leg of the 1980–81 semi-finals. In the Champions League era, the record stands at 16 games and is also held by Bayern Munich. The run began with a 1–0 win against Manchester City in the first match of the 2014–15 group stage and reached the 16th win after a 5–1 victory over Arsenal in the 2016–17 round of 16, then it ended after a 2–1 loss to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of that season.\nConsecutive away wins.\nThe most consecutive away wins in the Champions League (not including matches played at neutral venues) is seven, achieved on two occasions. Ajax were the first side to reach this number; their run began with a 2–0 group stage win against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu on 22 November 1995. They then defeated Borussia Dortmund at the Westfalenstadion in the quarter-finals and Panathinaikos at the Spyridon Louis in the semi-finals. Ajax's run continued the following season, winning all three away group stage matches, against Auxerre, Rangers and Grasshopper. Their record seventh win came on 19 March 1997, after defeating Atlético Madrid 3–2 at the Vicente Calderón after extra time in the quarter-finals. The streak would end in the following round, as Ajax lost 4–1 to Juventus in the semi-finals at the Stadio delle Alpi on 23 April 1997.\nBayern Munich would go on to equal this record nearly two decades later; their run began with a 3–1 round of 16 victory against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 19 February 2013, and continued with wins against Juventus at the Juventus Stadium in the quarter-finals and Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the semi-finals. The streak continued the following season, with group stage away wins over Manchester City, Viktoria Plzeň and CSKA Moscow. The record equaling seventh win was achieved when Bayern again defeated Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in the round of 16 on 19 February 2014. Their run ended with a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the first leg of the quarter-finals on 1 April 2014.\nConsecutive wins.\nBayern Munich (2019–20 and 2020–21) holds the record of 15 consecutive wins in the Champions League. Bayern's run started on 18 September 2019 with a 3–0 win against Red Star Belgrade in their first group stage match, after losing 1–3 against Liverpool in the previous season's round of 16. The run continued in their other five group matches and all five knockout matches, as they defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1–0 in the final.

The streak ended in the following round, following Bayern's 1–0 quarter-final defeat at Villarreal. During this run, Bayern defeated Barcelona and Lyon in the 2019–20 quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively, played in Lisbon over a single leg as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They also defeated Paris Saint-Germain in the 2020 final.

        "text": "The history of the European Cup and UEFA Champions League spans over sixty years of competition, finding winners and runners-up from all over the continent.\nBeginnings.\nEarly tournaments.\nThe first time when champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3. Ironically, the Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship consisted entirely of Scottish players – Scottish players who moved to England to play professionally in those days were known as the Scotch Professors.\nPrior to that, other \"Football World Championships\" took place, although those were between Scottish and English cup winners, as the respective leagues were not yet established.\nClub competitions between teams from European countries trace their origins back as far as 1897, when the \"Challenge Cup\" was founded as a competition between clubs from Austria-Hungary that under normal circumstances would not meet in competition. This competition ran until 1911, with its last winners, Wiener Sportclub, retaining the trophy. Simultaneously, English and Scottish clubs competed in the Football World Championship. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy was played for in 1909 and 1911 in Turin, Italy, involving clubs from Italy, Germany, Switzerland and England.\nThe Challenge Cup is considered to be the forerunner of the first true pan-European club competition, the Mitropa Cup, which came about following the demise of Austria-Hungary after World War I. At that time, the various nations of central Europe were introducing professional leagues. The introduction of an international club tournament was intended to assist the new professional clubs financially. The Mitropa Cup was first played for in 1927.\nAn early attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe was made by Swiss club Servette in 1930. The tournament called \"Coupe des Nations\" was a great success and the champions of the ten major European football nations of the time were invited. The cup was won by Hungarian club Újpest. Despite the great success, the tournament was never organised again, due to financial issues.\nFollowing World War II, the reduced standing of the Mitropa Cup led to the foundation of a new competition, the Latin Cup, for teams from France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. This competition was played as a mini-tournament at the end of each season by the league champions from each country. Another tournament was the Coppa Grasshoppers played in 1952 to 1957.\nCreation of the European Cup.\nThe \"Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones\", or \"South American Championship of Champions\", kicked off in 1948 after years of deliberation and organisation and set into motion the antecedent of the Copa Libertadores. French sports journalist Jacques Ferran became fascinated with the 1948 South American idea of a continental club champions league. The UEFA document on the history of the European Cup confirms that Jacques Ferran and Gabriel Hanot, journalists for the French sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\", were the founding fathers of the European Cup. In interviews to the Brazilian sports TV programme \"Globo Esporte\" in 2015 and Chilean newspaper \"El Mercúrio\" in 2018, Jacques Ferran said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Cup: \"How could Europe, which wanted to be ahead of the rest of the world, not be able to accomplish a competition of the same kind of the South American one? We needed to follow that example.\"\nThe summer of 1953 saw Wolverhampton Wanderers play a friendly match against a South African XI to begin a remarkable run of victories over the next months. Wolves played a series of friendlies against foreign opposition such as Racing Club of Argentina, Spartak Moscow of the Soviet Union, among others, before meeting Honvéd of Hungary in a game televised live on the BBC. The Honvéd team included many of the Hungary national team, which was dominating world football at the time. Wolves won the game 3–2, which led their manager Stan Cullis and the British press to proclaim them as \"Champions of the World\". This was the final spur for Hanot who had long campaigned for a European-wide club tournament to determine who was the best of the continent.\nThe UEFA Congress of March 1955 saw the proposal raised, with approval given in April of that year, and the kick-off of the first European Cup the following season. However, the would be no Soviet (until 1967) or English teams in the first tournament.\nTimeline.\n1955 to 1960 – Real Madrid's early dominance.\nReal Madrid dominated the first five competitions, with the team led by Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Francisco Gento and José Santamaría winning each of the first five competitions relatively comfortably, while this was the case, several other clubs did offer some resistance during the late 1950s, notably from Stade de Reims of France, who reached two finals and several Italian clubs such as Milan and Fiorentina. Hibernian were the first British club to play in the European Cup, reaching the semi-final of the inaugural tournament in 1955. The English league winners, Chelsea, were denied entry by the Football League's secretary Alan Hardaker, who believed it was in the best interests of English football and football in general for them not to enter. This era culminated in the famous 1960 European Cup final, at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland, where Real Madrid obliterated Eintracht Frankfurt of West Germany 7–3 in front of BBC and other Eurovision television cameras and a crowd of 127,621. (Hampden Park would go on to achieve the highest attendance for a European club competition match when the European Cup semi-final second leg tie between Celtic and Leeds United was played on 15 April 1970 before a crowd of 136,505. The match was played at Hampden rather than Celtic Park as the huge demand to see the game had been anticipated.)\n1961 to 1962 – Benfica success.\nReal Madrid's domination was ended by their biggest domestic rivals, Barcelona, in the first round of the 1960–61 competition, Barça continued on to the final at the Wankdorf Stadion in Bern, where they were defeated (3–2) in a close game by Benfica. This team, captained by the impressive Mário Coluna, were joined by the legendary Eusébio during the following 1961–62 season, where they defended the trophy after beating Real Madrid 5–3 in the final at the Olympisch Stadion in Amsterdam.\n1963 to 1965 – Milanese Mastery.\nBenfica after winning two European Cups would then go on to reach a third successive final in 1963, but lost to Milan, whose city rivals Inter Milan would win the trophy in both 1964 and 1965, defeating Real Madrid and Benfica, respectively, in the process. This \"Grande Inter\" period is well remembered in Italy with many at the time expecting the club to match the domination of Real throughout the decade.\n1966 – Real Madrid's return.\nReal Madrid, who defeated Inter in the 1966 semi-final, went to win a sixth European Cup with victory against FK Partizan at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, of the great 1950s side, only Francisco Gento played in all six winning teams, with this Real Madrid being composed solely of Spanish players – a major contrast to the multicultural teams of five years before.\n1967 – Lisbon Lions.\nIn 1967, Celtic became the first team in Northern Europe to win the competition, coming back from 1–0 down after a Sandro Mazzola penalty to beat Internazionale 2–1 in the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, with goals from Tommy Gemmell and Stevie Chalmers. The team, which became known as \"the Lisbon Lions\", managed by Jock Stein, were unique as they were all born within of Celtic Park in Glasgow.\n1968 – The first English team.\nIn 1968, ten years after the Munich air disaster, Manchester United became the first English team to win the competition, defeating Benfica in the final 4–1 after extra time at Wembley Stadium in London. Matt Busby, United's manager at the time of the disaster in Munich, survived life-threatening injuries suffered in the crash and was still at the helm for United, and two other Munich survivors played in the game – Bobby Charlton, who scored two goals in the game, and Bill Foulkes.\n1969 – AC Milan again.\nMilan brought another Italian victory in 1969 knocking out the two previous winners en route to the final. The 1969 final was against Ajax, marking the emergence of teams from the Netherlands.\n1970 to 1973 – Dutch control.\nIn 1970 Feyenoord of Rotterdam were the first Dutch outfit to collect the European Cup after defeating Glasgow Celtic the tournaments only coin toss finalists 2–1 after extra time. However, for the next three years, Ajax and its exponents of \"Total Football\", including Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens, among others, together with their pioneering tactician and coach Rinus Michels, would more profoundly take European centre stage, dispatching Panathinaikos, Inter Milan and Juventus in successive finals.\n1974 to 1976 – Bayern Munich hat-trick.\nThe mid-1970s belonged to Bayern Munich. Led by Franz Beckenbauer, and also starring Sepp Maier, Gerd Müller, Uli Hoeneß and Paul Breitner, the German club not only emulated Ajax's trio of victories but was unmistakably inspired by the beacon of \"Total Football\". In its first final, Bayern triumphed over Atlético Madrid in a replayed match, the first of the two games ending up in a draw following a late equalizer from Hans Georg Schwarzenbeck, the second one resulting in a 4-0 hammering in Brussels. The following year, Leeds United were controversially – some say corruptly – vanquished 2–0 in an ill-tempered affair at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Lastly, Saint-Étienne were downed at Hampden Park in Glasgow in 1976. Bayern would not only win 3 European cups but they also led 5 Bayern Munich players dominant the entire football world in history winning the UEFA Euro 1972, the 1974 World Cup and then finishing first and second at the UEFA Euro 1976 and the 1976 Summer Olympics as Germany. After this golden period, the side slowly declined and would not win the tournament for 25 years. They would however appear in another final in 1982 with three of the mid-seventies title winners in the squad.\n1977 to 1984 – The English Reign.\nIn 1977 Liverpool beat Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 in Rome, and then in 1978, became the first British club to win the trophy twice by beating the Belgian champions, Club Brugge at Wembley. Liverpool lost in the first round of the 1979 competition to fellow English side Nottingham Forest who went on to win the tournament in arguably the most impressive rise to the top of continental football in the European game's history, guided by their uniquely gifted manager Brian Clough, as they defeated Swedish side Malmö FF 1–0 in the Munich final. The next year, Forest beat Hamburg at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium by the same scoreline to defend the trophy successfully in 1980 and remain the only side to win the competition more times (twice) than their own domestic league (once). Liverpool returned to the final in 1981 where they picked up their third trophy with a 1–0 win over Real Madrid in Paris.\nAnother club from England, Aston Villa, won the competition in 1982 with a 1–0 win over Bayern Munich at Feijenoord Stadion in Rotterdam. Hamburg then won the title in 1983, beating Juventus 1–0 in a final that, for the first time in seven years, featured no English side. Liverpool, however, were back in 1984 to defeat Roma in their opponent's stadium, the Stadio Olimpico, in a penalty shoot-out after the teams were tied 1–1, becoming the first team to win the trophy four times since Real Madrid in the 1950s. The match is best known for the antics of Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. As Roma's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite the back of the net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, famously wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani duly missed and Liverpool went on to win the shoot-out 4–2, making Grobbelaar the first African to win a medal in the competition.\n1985 – Liverpool, Juventus and the Heysel disaster.\nLiverpool, having won the 1984 tournament, returned to defend the trophy at Brussels a year later. But the 1–0 defeat by Juventus was overshadowed by the death of 39 mostly Juventus fans in the Heysel Stadium. The consequence was a five-year ban from European competition for English clubs, with a six-year ban on Liverpool. The long term consequences for English club football due to the actions of the fans at Heysel were severe in terms of top level success, with English clubs initially struggling to make a significant impact in European competition upon their return from the ban in fact it would be 14 years after Heysel before an English side would again triumph in the competition.\n1986 to 1988 – Unlikely heroes.\nThe first three seasons after the Heysel Disaster saw the European Cup lifted by Steaua București of Romania, Porto of Portugal and PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands. The final between Porto and Bayern Munich was regarded as an especially exciting final, with an audacious back-heel goal by Algeria's Rabah Madjer giving Porto their first title, while Steaua shocked Barcelona in Seville in a penalty shoot-out, when Steaua's goalkeeper Helmuth Duckadam saved four consecutive penalties to win 2–0, making the Bucharest team the first one from Eastern Europe to win.\n1989 to 1992 – AC Milan's assertion, and Barcelona's first title.\nIn 1989, under the management of Arrigo Sacchi, Milan won the European Cup for the first time in 20 years, defeating 1986 champions Steaua București 4–0 in the final. In 1990, Milan retained their title, defeating Benfica 1–0 in Vienna. The Dutch trio of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard were the brilliant heart of the Italian side, which also featured a defence comprising Mauro Tassotti, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini, often considered one of the greatest defences in the history of the game.\nThe 1991 trophy went to Yugoslav league champions Red Star Belgrade, who beat Marseille on penalties after a goalless draw. The 1991 final was also the only final in the period from 1989 to 1998 that failed to feature an Italian team. The ban on English clubs in European football was lifted for the 1990–91 season, but English champions Liverpool were unable to compete in the European Cup because they had to serve an extra year. The 1991–92 European Cup, which would be the last season under that name, underwent a change, with the quarter-finals being transformed into a group format. The final, played at Wembley Stadium, was won by Barcelona against Sampdoria. Barça, at the time nicknamed the \"Dream Team\", were coached by Johan Cruyff.\n1993 – The birth of the Champions League; Marseille attain first title.\nThe competition was renamed to UEFA Champions League for the 1992–93 season, undergoing some diverse changes of marketing and TV rights thanks to the partnership of UEFA and TEAM Marketing AG. The eight teams participating in the league format quarter-finals experienced an approach to match organisation and commercialisation that was very new.\nThe reformatting of the competition since the 1992-93 season has coincided with a marked reduction in the diversity of participating countries in the latter stages of the competition, with clubs from only four different countries represented in the semi-finals between 2021 and 2023.\nMarseille defeated Milan in the 1993 final, and became the first team to win the Champions League and the first European champions from France. They were later banned from defending their crown in what was only the beginning of a collapse which arose from domestic match fixing committed by chairman Bernard Tapie. The club was eventually stripped of their Ligue 1 championship after it was revealed that Tapie had cooked the club's financial books. Marseille remains the only French club to have won the European Cup/Champions League.\n1994 to 1997 – AC Milan title, Ajax and Juventus return and Borussia's first title.\nMilan reclaimed the trophy in 1994, beating a star-studded Barcelona side, 4–0, in what many have hailed as one of the finest European Cup final performances of the modern age. Milan were the underdogs, with two key defenders forced to sit out, but coach Fabio Capello spurned the traditional Italian caution of \"catenaccio\" and led them to a rout of Johan Cruyff's \"Dream Team\". Milan defender Marcel Desailly had previously played for Marseille when they won the Champions League, being the first player to win the Cup in consecutive seasons with different clubs, and also making him the first player to transfer to the finals opposing side. Milan also went on to reach the final in 1995 but lost 1–0 to a youthful Ajax side featuring Edwin van der Sar, Frank de Boer, Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert, as well as the veterans Frank Rijkaard and Danny Blind. It was the club's first triumph since 1973, when they had won three titles consecutively. Ajax, in turn, reached the next final in 1996, but fell to Juventus of Ciro Ferrara, the 1993 winner Didier Deschamps, Paulo Sousa and the notable offensive trio composed by Alessandro Del Piero, Fabrizio Ravanelli and the 1992 finalist Gianluca Vialli after a penalty shoot-out. Vialli became the sixth Italian player (after former Juventus players Sergio Brio, Antonio Cabrini, Gaetano Scirea, Marco Tardelli and Stefano Tacconi) to have won the three seasonal European club titles, first striker to do so.\nBorussia Dortmund won the UEFA Champions League in 1997. In the final in Munich, Dortmund faced Juventus. Karl-Heinz Riedle put Dortmund ahead shooting under the goalkeeper from a cross by Paul Lambert. Riedle then made it two with a bullet header from a corner kick. In the second half, Alessandro Del Piero pulled one back for Juventus with a back heel, then 20-year-old substitute and local boy Lars Ricken latched on to a through pass by Andreas Möller. Only 16 seconds after coming on to the pitch, Ricken chipped Angelo Peruzzi in the Juventus goal from over 20 yards with his first touch of the ball. Dortmund lifted the trophy with a 3–1 victory. Dortmund manager Ottmar Hitzfeld was able to lift the title for the first time.\nReal Madrid's return and dominance (1997–2002).\nThe following six seasons would see Real Madrid winning the competition three times.\n1998 – Real Madrid, back to the top.\nIn 1997–98, UEFA allowed the runners-up of top European leagues to compete in the Champions League. UEFA's rationale was that the quality of its premier tournament increased by including more top teams from big leagues rather than minnows. An old face claimed the crown in 1998: Real Madrid. The Spanish club won their first European Cup since 1966 and seventh overall when they beat Juventus 1–0 in the Italian club's third straight final (and second straight defeat).\n1999 – Manchester United return.\n1998–99 is remembered for the upset of Ottmar Hitzfeld's Bayern by Manchester United's treble success. United had already forged a reputation for late comebacks in England as they picked up the Premier League and FA Cup en route to the Champions League final. Having succeeded in both the league and FA Cup, the omens appeared to be with Manchester United for the Champions League. With Paul Scholes and captain Roy Keane suspended, goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel – playing his last match for the club – captained the team on the night, which was the 90th anniversary of the birth of Sir Matt Busby. Their opponents, Bayern Munich, were also chasing The Treble, and took the lead after just six minutes through a clever Mario Basler free-kick. It appeared to be enough for Bayern as Manchester United failed to find a way through, although Schmeichel was in inspirational form to keep his team in the game. With referee Pierluigi Collina signalling three minutes of stoppage time, the English club sent everyone forward (including Schmeichel) for a David Beckham corner, and were rewarded when substitute Teddy Sheringham turned home the equaliser after Ryan Giggs mis-hit a shot at goal. Just over a minute later, another Beckham corner again provided the danger as Sheringham headed it on to fellow substitute Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who flicked out a boot to send the ball into the roof of the net and win the European Cup for Manchester. United's manager, Alex Ferguson, memorably summed the experience up in a post-match interview when he said: \"Football, bloody hell.\" It was the club's first success since 1968 and marked the first English winner since Liverpool in 1984.\n2000 to 2002 – Real Madrid and Bayern Munich: reinvigoration.\nThe 1999–2000 season saw UEFA again ease the entry requirements for the Champions League. Now the top three leagues (Spain, Italy, and Germany, according to UEFA's rankings) could enter four teams, while the next three (England, France, and the Netherlands) could enter three.\nThis season saw Spanish clubs return to the top of the European table with the first all-country European Cup/Champions League final between Real Madrid and Valencia. Real Madrid started the 21st century in similar fashion to their 20th century exploits by defeating Valencia 3–0 to lift the European Cup again. On the way to the final, Real also successively eliminated the previous year's runners-up (Bayern Munich, semi-finals), and champions (Manchester United, quarter-finals). The tie against Manchester United saw a 3–2 away victory at Old Trafford, which included a goal created by midfielder Fernando Redondo and dubbed \"el taconazo (backheel) de Old Trafford\".\nLa Liga had another good outing in the 2001 Champions League, with Real Madrid and Valencia again reaching the semi-finals. Valencia returned to the final again in the 2001 only to lose again. The winner this time was Bayern Munich, who had earlier ousted defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals. The final ended 1–1 and Bayern won the shoot-out 5–4. That win also gave coach Ottmar Hitzfeld the distinction of winning the European Cup with two teams, having lifted it in 1997 with Borussia Dortmund. Valencia had now lost two Champions League finals in a row.\nReal Madrid faced another German team (Bayer Leverkusen) in the 2002 final at Glasgow's Hampden Park. Real Madrid were pursuing a policy at the time of signing one world-class player a year. That season they had added multiple FIFA World Player of the Year winner, Zinedine Zidane, for a fee of €71 million. Zidane volleyed home the winner in their 2–1 victory that gave the club its ninth European Cup and the third European Cup in five seasons, Bayer became the first finalist never to have won their domestic league; they had earlier lost the Bundesliga title in the last match of the season, and subsequently also lost in the DFB-Pokal final, to achieve a runners-up treble.\nParity amid Italian and English prominence (2003–2008).\n2003 and 2004 – All-Italian final and Porto's second title.\nThe next season saw Italian clubs return to the top of the European table. Juventus also made history in the European group stage by defeating Olympiacos 7–0. Although they had dominated the competition through the 1990s, there were no Serie A clubs in the quarter-finals in 2002. The following season, however, saw three Italian semi-finalists – and a final between Milan and Juventus. Milan won their sixth European Cup when they beat their old rivals 3–2 on penalties following a 0–0 draw. Milan captain Paolo Maldini lifted the trophy in Manchester exactly 40 years after his father Cesare had done so for Milan in London. Clarence Seedorf won the Champions League for the third time, and with three clubs. He had earlier won the cup with Ajax in 1995 and Real Madrid in 1998.\nThere was a major upset in 2004 when Porto defeated Monaco 3–0 to win the Champions League. Goals were scored by Carlos Alberto, Deco and Dmitri Alenichev. Neither team had been tipped for any success in the competition, but between them they managed to defeat Manchester United, Real Madrid and Chelsea, among other clubs. Porto and their manager José Mourinho achieved the rare feat of following up a UEFA Cup victory by winning the Champions League the next season. Russian international Alenichev became only the third player after Ronald Koeman and Ronaldo to score a goal in two consecutive different European finals and Vítor Baía became the ninth player to have won the three European club titles.\n2005 to 2008 – Liverpool's Miracle in Istanbul, Barcelona, AC Milan and Manchester United.\nThere was a similar surprise in 2005. This time, it involved two of Europe's most successful clubs, with six-time European champions Milan facing four-time winners Liverpool in one of the most dramatic finals in the competition's history. Milan broke through after just 52 seconds with Maldini striking the fastest goal in European Cup final history. The Italians took control of the game, Andriy Shevchenko fed Hernán Crespo five minutes before half-time to make it 2–0, only for Crespo to add another two minutes later after a defence-splitting pass from Kaká. With just under ten minutes of the second half played, captain Steven Gerrard scored with a header to begin the comeback. Vladimír Šmicer's long-range drive made it 3–2 just two minutes later and, on the hour mark, Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso completed the comeback by converting the rebound from his saved penalty kick to make it 3–3. Liverpool's three goals came in the space of only six minutes. Milan almost won it at the end of extra time when Shevchenko was twice denied in quick succession by Jerzy Dudek. That proved crucial as they moved on to a penalty shoot-out where Liverpool triumphed 3–2 and captured their fifth European Cup victory and as five-time winners earned the honour of keeping the trophy.\nAfter three years of dominance by La Liga from 2000 to 2002, Spain teams were not as successful during 2003–2005 as they only had semi-finalists Real Madrid in 2003 and Deportivo de La Coruña in 2004. In 2006, they made a triumphant return with Barcelona and Villarreal in the semi-finals. The semi-finalists were Villarreal, Arsenal, Milan, and Barcelona. Arsenal succeeded in holding off Villarreal (including a Jens Lehmann save of a late penalty from Juan Román Riquelme) to a 0–0 draw which put them through to final. Barcelona played Milan in the other semi-final, and held on to the 1–0 advantage of the first leg to qualify for the final. In the final, held on 17 May at the Stade de France, Lehmann became the first player ever to be sent off in a European Cup/Champions League final after fouling Samuel Eto'o just outside the penalty area. Arsenal took the lead from a Sol Campbell header in the 37th minute and held it for most of the second half, with substitute keeper Manuel Almunia tipping away a shot by Eto'o. Eto'o equalised off a probing feed from substitute Henrik Larsson in the 76th minute. Five minutes later, another Larsson ball found Juliano Belletti, who put the second goal through the legs of Almunia to give Barça their final 2–1 margin.\nIn the 2006–07 season, English sides dominated again. In a repeat of the 2005 semi-final, Liverpool knocked out Chelsea this time in a shoot-out. Chelsea won the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1–0 thanks to a goal by Joe Cole, but Daniel Agger levelled the aggregate scoreline at Anfield. Thus, the match went to penalties which Liverpool won 4–1, with keeper Pepe Reina saving twice. This was Chelsea's third semi-final defeat in four years. The first leg of the other semi-final between Milan and Manchester United, at Old Trafford, was an exciting match with Cristiano Ronaldo opening the scoring, only for two Kaká goals to put Milan ahead 2–1 at half time. A Wayne Rooney brace in the second half gave United a 3–2 aggregate lead. The second leg at the San Siro, however, was a one-sided affair with Milan outclassing Man United from the start and winning 3–0 thanks to goals from Kaká, Clarence Seedorf and Alberto Gilardino, and thus setting up a revenge meeting with Liverpool in the final. Milan got their revenge as they won the final 2–1, two goals from Filippo Inzaghi proving to be the difference. Liverpool scored late on through Dirk Kuyt, giving \"the Reds\" hope of another amazing comeback but to no avail, and Milan were European champions for a seventh time.\nThe 2008 UEFA Champions League final was the first all English club final in European Cup/Champions League history, and was played out between Manchester United and Chelsea in front of a packed-out Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. United took the lead midway through the first half when Cristiano Ronaldo's header met Wes Brown's cross and bounced into the bottom left-hand corner of Petr Čech's goal. Poor defending, however, enabled Frank Lampard to equalise in the last minute of the first half. Although both sides created chances, the scoreline remained 1–1 until the end of extra time, and penalties loomed. Didier Drogba became the second player to be sent off in a European Cup/Champions League final in the second period of extra time for a slap on Nemanja Vidić. Extra time finished and a penalty shoot-out was to decide it. Both teams scored their first two penalties, but Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was saved by Petr Čech. For Chelsea's last penalty, however, captain John Terry slipped as he was taking the shot, and the ball hit the outside of the post and flew helplessly wide. In the second round of sudden death, Ryan Giggs successfully converted his penalty before Edwin van der Sar won the Champions' League for United by saving Nicolas Anelka's effort.\nSpanish dominance (2008–2018).\nThe following ten competitions would see the Spanish dominance rise to unprecedented levels, with Barcelona and Real Madrid winning seven titles, as well as having Atlético Madrid reach two finals. Real Madrid reached the semi-finals of the competition for eight consecutive seasons, from 2010–11 to 2017–18, winning four titles, including \"La Décima\" and the threepeat.\n2009 to 2011 – Guardiola's Barcelona dominate, Mourinho's Internazionale treble, and Manchester United's two UCL finals against Barça.\nEn route to the final, Barcelona overcame Chelsea in a controversial semi-final when Andrés Iniesta scored for Barcelona in London in injury time, advancing them to the final on away goals. The other semi-final saw Arsenal face Manchester United, with United winning the first leg 1–0 then winning the second leg in London 3–1, advancing through on a 4–1 aggregate scoreline. On 27 May 2009, Barcelona overcame Manchester United at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, winning 2–0 with goals from Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi. This made Barça the first team from La Liga to win a domestic cup, domestic league, and European Cup treble. This was made all the remarkable by the fact that it was coach Pep Guardiola's first season in charge, with just one year as coach of the B team as previous experience. At age 38, Guardiola, who also won the title as a player with Barça in 1992, became the youngest coach ever to lead a team to the trophy.\nIn 2010, for the first time in five years, no English teams were featured in the semi-finals (three English teams were in the semi-finals for each of the past three seasons before), with Manchester United and Arsenal both being eliminated in the quarter-finals. Internazionale stunned Barcelona with a 3–1 win in Milan in the semi-final first leg, holding them to 1–0 the second leg, thus advancing through. Bayern Munich defeated Lyon 4–0 on aggregate to advance to the final. On 22 May 2010, Internazionale, coached by José Mourinho, beat Bayern 2–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu.\nOn 28 May 2011 at Wembley Stadium in London, Barcelona beat Manchester United for a second final in three years. The Catalans dominated the match, winning 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Lionel Messi and David Villa, securing their fourth Champions League title. Wayne Rooney scored for Manchester United to level the score going into half-time. This marked Barcelona's fourth title overall and third title in six seasons (2005–06 to 2010–11).\n2012 to 2013 – Chelsea's first title and Bayern's return.\nOn 19 May 2012, at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Chelsea finally, against the odds, delivered the big prize to London and also back to England. In a come-from-behind victory over Bayern Munich, they won 4–3 on penalties after the game had finished 1–1 after extra time. Bayern enjoyed much possession but failed to capitalise, allowing Didier Drogba to equalise late in the game after Thomas Müller had given Bayern the lead. During the penalty shoot-out, Čech, who saved a penalty by ex-Chelsea player Arjen Robben earlier in extra-time, saved two spot-kicks and set the stage for Drogba to score the winner with the final kick.\nThe 2012–13 competition saw the first all-German final between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund after their victories over Spanish clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively, in the semi-finals. Bayern Munich's victory was somewhat impressive, as they defeated a struggling Barcelona side 7–0 on aggregate to set the record of biggest two-leg win in a semi-final replacing Manchester United's 6–1 win over Schalke 04 in 2011. In the final, Bayern beat Dortmund 2–1, with Robben scoring the winning goal 89 minutes into the match and won their fifth UEFA Champions League and after winning the titles of the Bundesliga one week before and the DFB-Pokal, Bayern Munich became the first German team to win the treble.\n2014 to 2018 – Real Madrid at the center of Spanish dominance: \"Los Blancos\" win four titles in five years, Barcelona win their second treble.\nReal Madrid won their long-awaited \"La Decima\" (translates into Spanish as \"the tenth\"), their record-breaking tenth European Cup/UEFA Champions League title, in the 2013–14 season following a 4–1 win after extra time in the final against city rivals and La Liga champions Atlético Madrid. It was the first same-city final and the second all-Spanish final. Diego Simeone coached Atlético in an incredible season after clinching the Spanish league title a week before the final and his side led 1–0 through Diego Godín until a Sergio Ramos header deep into injury time took it to extra time.\nIn 2015, Barcelona won their fifth Champions League trophy, defeating Juventus by three goals to one in the final. By winning their fifth title, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice. Barcelona's attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", scored 122 goals in all competitions, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.\nIn 2016, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid both reached the final again. This game was a rematch of the 2014 final, and became the third all-Spanish final and the second same-city final in the tournament's history. The match went to penalties after the score finished at 1–1 at the end of extra time. Real Madrid went on to win their 11th title after beating Atlético 5–3 on penalties, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring the winning penalty for \"Los Blancos\".\nThe victory in the 2017 UEFA Champions League final against Juventus made Real Madrid the first team ever to defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending its record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\". Real Madrid won their third title in a row in 2018, beating Liverpool 3–1 in Kyiv. It was a match to forget for Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius who made two errors during the match: he performed a wayward throw which rebounded off Karim Benzema for Real Madrid's first goal. Then, following a great overhead bicycle kick by Gareth Bale for the Spaniards' second, he mishandled a long-range shot by Bale for Real Madrid's third.\nBetween 2010 and 2018, Real Madrid reached the semi-finals eight consecutive times, while Bayern and Barcelona achieved the feat five times.\nPremier League leads the way (2018–present).\nThe following years would see two all-English finals, as well as Liverpool losing the 2022 final to Real Madrid. In 2023, Manchester City won their first ever title and a first tournament for the third English victory in five years.\n2019 – English teams contest the final after stunning comebacks.\nAfter Cristiano Ronaldo left Real Madrid, they struggled to replicate the same form as the previous four years and failed in their title defence. Ajax made the first semi finals since 1997 knocking out Real Madrid and Juventus. Their squad was one of the youngest, with De Ligt the youngest captain. Tottenham won against Manchester City in a controversial turnover of Raheem Sterling's 95th min goal by VAR and knocked out Ajax in the injury time comeback with Lucas Moura scoring on 93 mins breaking the hearts of Ajax players and fans. Liverpool won against FC Barcelona 4-0 after a dramatic turnaround losing 3–0 in the first leg which was again a humiliating knockout of FC Barcelona after AS Roma in 2018 quarter finals. Manchester United also won on away goals against PSG with dramatic comeback turning around 2–0 to 3-1 which resulted in aggregate score of 3–3. Manchester United lost 4–0 on aggregate against FC Barcelona in quarter finals. Liverpool won their sixth European Cup by defeating fellow English side Tottenham Hotspur in the 2019 final. An early penalty converted by Mohamed Salah and a late Divock Origi goal ensured a 2–0 victory for Jürgen Klopp's team. Both finalists had achieved unlikely comebacks in their semi-finals, with Liverpool overcoming a first-leg 3–0 defeat by Barcelona with a second-leg 4–0 win and Tottenham scoring the three second-half goals they required to defeat Ajax in the second leg in Amsterdam and also on away goals.\n2020 – COVID-19 pandemic and Bayern superiority.\nThe 2019–20 season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with round of 16 matches that were still ongoing being suspended until further notice. The host city for the final would eventually be changed from Istanbul to Lisbon, as was the majority of the remainder of the competition. The knockout stage resumed in August, with remaining second leg round of 16 games being played behind closed doors at their respective home stadiums as part of the season restart. Quarter-final and semi-final matches were played in only one leg at the Estadio Jose Alvalade and Estádio da Luz over the course of about two weeks, following the teams' completion of their respective domestic seasons.\nAfter winning every match post-restart to secure a league and cup double, Bayern Munich continued their dominance in the Champions League, following up their perfect group stage record with an aggregate victory over Chelsea, an 8–2 thrashing of Barcelona and 3–0 win against Lyon, reaching the final with a 100 percent win record still intact in the competition. Their opponents in the final would be Paris Saint-Germain, who had reached the showpiece match for the first time in club history. The match was the first ever final to be played in the month of August and the second final between teams from France and Germany, after Bayern's win over Saint-Étienne in 1976.\nWith the match scoreless after half-time, former PSG player Kingsley Coman scored a header in the 59th minute against his old club, securing a 1–0 win for Bayern that sealed a second treble in club history, following up from the one they achieved in the 2012–13 season. Bayern lifted the European Cup for the sixth time, equalling Liverpool on the all-time list, and became only the second European team after Barcelona to secure multiple continental trebles. They also became the first side to win every match of a Champions League campaign.\n2021 – Super League threat and Chelsea surprise.\nThe 2020–21 UEFA Champions League continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit with a condensed schedule. Porto and Chelsea were unlikely heroes when they won against Juventus and Atlético Madrid respectively. Defending champions Bayern Munich were knocked out on away goals by previous finalists PSG after missing Robert Lewandowski with injury in a rematch of the 2020 final.\nBehind closed doors however, The Super League was being planned and was unexpectedly announced on 18 April by Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid, Barcelona, the \"Big Six\" English clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur), Juventus, and the two big Milan clubs (Milan and Inter Milan), which threatened the existence of the Champions League. UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin and several delegates threatened to expel the clubs joining The Super League when Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid were in the semi-finals. Rumours persisted that PSG were expected to win the Champions League by default after rejecting an offer to join. Borussia Dortmund, Porto and Bayern Munich also refused offers to join The Super League. FIFA and UEFA opposed The Super League and there were widespread protests from fans, governments, players, FAs and much of the football world, forcing the Big Six English clubs to withdraw from the league. The Milan clubs later followed suit with Atlético Madrid also withdrawing; Andrea Agnelli, chairman of Juventus and vice-chairman of The Super League, conceded that the project would not proceed. Florentino Pérez, president of Real Madrid and chairman of The Super League, cited lack of profits, lack of interest from younger fans, fewer matches between elite clubs in the Champions League and the pandemic as reasons for the creation of The Super League. Court proceedings by the remaining Super League clubs and UEFA are ongoing in the European Court of Justice.\nChelsea made the semi-finals for the first time in seven years facing Real Madrid for the first time. Man City defeated PSG 4–1 on aggregate en route to their first appearance in the final, while Chelsea defeated Real Madrid 3–1 on aggregate to set up the second all-English final in three years. Chelsea won the title for the second time after defeating City 1–0 at the Estádio do Dragão thanks to a goal by Kai Havertz.\nEvolution of the tournament format.\nThe format of the competition has evolved substantially over the years, notably with the introduction of a Group Phase beginning in 1991, and multiple national representatives in 1998. The following summarises the evolution of the championship format through the years:\nList of participating nations by first entry.\nGroup stage only.\nSince the addition of a group phase to the European Cup in the 1991–92 season, the earlier stages of the competition have been classified as qualifying rounds and from the 1994–95 season, all rounds prior to the group stage have been considered qualification rounds. The following nations have had representation at the group stage of the competition:"

        "text": "John Francis Egan (January 31, 1939 – July 21, 2022) was an American professional basketball player and coach. He played for the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Baltimore Bullets, Los Angeles Lakers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and San Diego / Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association from 1961 to 1972. He coached the Rockets from 1973 to 1976.\nEarly life and playing career.\nEgan was born on January 31, 1939, in Hartford, Connecticut. Playing for the basketball team at Weaver High School, which won the New England high school basketball championship in 1956 and 1957, he was named to the \"Parade\" All-America Boys Basketball Team. He was known as \"Space\", a nickname which alluded to \"his ability to stay in the air during drives to the basket or to the length of his long-distance shots\". Egan attended Providence College, where he played college basketball for the Providence Friars, and won the 1961 National Invitation Tournament.\nThe Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA) selected Egan in the second round of the 1961 NBA draft. The New York Knicks acquired Egan from the Pistons in a three-team trade on December 16, 1963. The Knicks traded Egan, Johnny Green, and Jim \"Bad News\" Barnes to the Baltimore Bullets for Walt Bellamy on November 2, 1965. The Milwaukee Bucks selected Egan from the Bullets in the 1968 NBA Expansion Draft. Before the 1968–69 NBA season, the Bucks traded Egan to the Los Angeles Lakers for a future draft pick. He became a key rotation player for the Lakers, who reached the 1969 NBA Finals but were beaten by the Boston Celtics in Game 7. Egan was not as effective in the following season, as the Lakers again reached the Finals but were beaten by the Knicks in Game 7.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers selected Egan in the 1970 NBA expansion draft. He was acquired by the San Diego Rockets from the Cavaliers for a third‐round pick in the 1971 NBA draft (41st overall–Jackie Ridgle) and cash on December 8, 1970. Egan became one of the original Houston Rockets when the team left San Diego in 1971. His playing career ended after the 1971–72 season.

He was the shortest player in the NBA for most of his 11-year career.\nCoaching career.\nIn January 1972, Rockets coach Tex Winter named Egan an assistant coach, and he continued as a player-coach for the remainder of the season. He retired as a player after the season, and was promoted to become head coach, succeeding Winter on January 21, 1973. At one point, he was the youngest and shortest coach in the NBA. During his years as head coach, the Rockets were 129–152, with one playoff appearance in 1975, when they defeated the New York Knicks in the first round to earn the franchise's first playoff series win. He was fired and replaced by Tom Nissalke on April 20, 1976, after the team failed to qualify for the postseason with a 40–42 record.\nPersonal life.\nEgan married Joan (), his high school sweetheart. They had two children and five grandchildren. Joan died in 1998 from ovarian cancer.\nAfter his basketball career, Egan remained in Houston, where he founded and operated an insurance business.

The ACA was founded in 1997, and has 23 member countries.\nThe role of the ACA includes promoting the development of cricket in Africa and organising some regional tournaments. These have included the ACA Africa T20 Cup and the Africa Women's Twenty20 Championship. The role of the ACA is complementary to the International Cricket Council (ICC), which organises the regional qualifying tournaments for global events.\nHistory.\nThe ACA has its origins in the Zone VI Cricket Confederation, which was established in 1991 to coordinate international cricket in Southern Africa along the lines of the African Zone VI Athletics Championships. The inaugural Zone VI tournament was held in Windhoek in September 1991 with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, and Zambia participating along with the Oxford University Cricket Club as guests. The confederation soon secured the support of the United Cricket Board of South Africa and expanded outside of Southern Africa, with Uganda joining in 1994 and Kenya joining in 1995. In March 1996, a meeting was held in Johannesburg to discuss the formation of an Africa-wide body.\nThe inaugural annual general meeting of the Africa Cricket Association (ACA) was held in Harare in August 1997. The last Zone VI tournament was also held in 1997 and replaced by an Africa Cup open to countries from all around the continent. Hoosain Ayob was appointed as full-time development director. Peter Chingoka of Zimbabwe was elected chairman of the ACA in 1998, replacing South Africa's Krish Mackerdhuj.\nIn 2005, the ACA and the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) established Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation as a vehicle to promote the Afro-Asia Cup, a series of One Day International (ODI) matches between an Africa XI and an Asia XI to raise funds for the development of cricket on both continents. The 2005 Afro-Asia Cup was held in South Africa and suffered from low attendance and a lack of interest from the players, although generating significant television revenues. A second tournament was held in India in 2007 but the event was not continued, although several proposals for a revival have been made.\nIn 2023, the ACA announced a 10-year partnership with Mumbai-based firm Corcom Media Ventures for the organisation, promotion, and broadcasting of ACA tournaments, including the ACA Africa T20 Cup and plans for a Women's Africa T20 Cup and an African Premier League."

        "text": "Marcus Antonio Robinson (born February 27, 1975) is an American former football player in the NFL, who played the position of wide receiver.\nHe has played for the Chicago Bears, the Baltimore Ravens, and the Minnesota Vikings, as well as the Rhein Fire. He founded the Marcus Robinson Foundation for underprivileged children.\nEarly life.\nRobinson was born in Fort Valley, Georgia and attended Peach County High School in Fort Valley, where he starred in football and track. In football, he won All-America and All-State honors as a wide receiver, free safety, and punter. In track, he won regional titles on the 100 and 200 meter dashes.\nCollege career.\nRobinson played wide receiver at the University of South Carolina.\nProfessional career.\nRobinson was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round (108th overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft. He missed his rookie season with a thumb injury. In 1998, Robinson played with the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe during the NFL the offseason. He led the NFL Europe league in receiving yards, won the season MVP award, and won the championship at World Bowl '98.\nRobinson had a successful season in 1999 with the Bears, setting a team record with 1,400 receiving yards which stood until the record was broken by Brandon Marshall in 2012.\nInjuries forced him into a journeyman role for the rest of his career.\nAs a Baltimore Raven in 2003, Robinson caught four touchdown passes in an overtime win over the Seattle Seahawks. He was expected to be resigned, but the Ravens wanted their first star at wide receiver, so Robinson was let a free agent. He was the leading wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings the previous three years before he was cut on Christmas Eve, 2006. The move came a day after the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" published an interview with Robinson in which he expressed displeasure with the Vikings' 6-9-1 record.\nHe signed a one-day contract with the Chicago Bears in June 2008, citing his desire to retire with the team that gave him his first chance in pro football. He officially retired on June 9, 2008.\nLife after the NFL.\nRobinson is currently working as a physical trainer for young athletes. He is also the sprint coach for the Marian Hurricanes track team in Woodstock, Illinois.\nPersonal life.\nHis nephew, Demarcus Robinson, is a wide receiver in the NFL and was selected in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs."

        "title": "High school ice hockey in New Jersey",
        "text": "Ice Hockey is currently played by approximately 161 high school varsity teams in NJ. Teams are divided into conferences: the Gordon Conference, Big North Conference, New Jersey Ice Hockey League, Morris County Secondary School Ice Hockey League, Union County Ice Hockey League, Skylands Conference, Greater Middlesex Conference, Colonial Valley Conference, Shore Conference, Independents, and Prep Schools. Most of these leagues are divided into divisions. A State Championship Tournament is organized at the end of the season by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association.\nDivisions.\nHockey is one of the few sports in the state with \"rolling divisions\". The divisions can change every year depending on the performance of the teams and new teams formed. The divisions are arranged by geography and skill level. Typically, the last place team in a higher division will be moved into the lower division, with the first place team of the lower division moving into the higher division.\nState Tournament.\nThe NJSIAA crowns state champions in four categories; Private, Public A, Public B and Public C. Through 1994, public and private schools played in one state tournament; however, private schools dominated the tournament due to their ability to recruit the best players in the state without geographical limitation. Beginning in 1995, the NJSIAA held separate private and public tournaments, crowning a private and public champion, with these champions playing each other for the overall state championship. In 2005, the NJSIAA eliminated the overall state championship game because a public school had won only once, in 1997. Similarly, in 2008, the Public Tournament was divided into A and B categories based on school enrollment as the smaller schools generally were unable to compete with the larger schools. The public tournament was divided once again in 2018 to include Public C. In the 2021–2022 season the Public C tournament would pivot again to comprise the growing number of cooperative teams in the state. The initial Public C season would have forty-three co-op and tri-op teams competing for the state crown.\nTo qualify for the State Tournament, teams must have played a minimum of 10 games and compiled a record of .500 or better record by a date set by the NJSIAA, usually around February 15. Teams within four games of .500 may petition for an at-large selection to the Tournament. The NJSIAA may select a maximum of 3 public and 2 private teams for an at-large berth. All members of the Gordon Conference earn automatic entry to the Private Tournament.\nIn recent years, Delbarton and Randolph have been the dominant private and public hockey programs in the state. Delbarton has appeared in 13 of the last 19 Private School Championships, winning 8 of the last 12; while Randolph has appeared in 11 of the last 15 Public A Championships (8 of the last 9), winning 7 of the last 11. Coincidentally, these two schools are located just seven miles apart in Morris County.\nState Championship History.\n State Championship Finals \n 1976-Brick 3, Chatham Township 2 (OT)\n 1977-Brick 3, Livingston 2\n 1978-West Essex 6, Livingston 3\n 1979-Brick 2, Seton Hall Prep 1\n 1980-Livingston 1, Brick 0 (OT)\n 1981-Montclair 6, Brick 5\n 1982-Livingston 4, Montclair 2\n 1983-CBA 3, Seton Hall Prep 0\n 1984-St. Joseph (Montvale) 7, Brick 6\n 1985-St. Joseph (Montvale) 4, Brick 2\n 1986-Brick 2, Delbarton 1\n 1987-Montclair 4, Delbarton 2\n 1988-Montclair 2, St. Joseph (Montvale) 1\n 1989-Delbarton, St. Joseph (Montvale) - Game Cancelled/Co-Champions See Frozen Flashback\n 1990-Brick 2, Montclair 1\n 1991-ST.

        "text": "Scott Allen Young (born October 1, 1967) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger and a member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In July 2017 he was named director of player development for the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nHe is a two-time Stanley Cup champion, winning in 1991 with the Pittsburgh Penguins and 1996 with the Colorado Avalanche. He also played with the Hartford Whalers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, St. Louis Blues, and Dallas Stars.\nPlaying career.\nYoung gained attention as a star hockey player while still in high school. He played his prep school hockey at St. Mark's School in Southborough, Massachusetts, playing with teammates that included fellow future-NHL players Doug and Greg Brown. His play allowed him to play with the United States in the World Junior Ice Hockey Championship in 1985, the beginning of a long international career representing the United States. Following the championship Young went to play for the Boston University Terriers. He played there two years, winning rookie of the year honors in 1986. Young was also drafted by the Hartford Whalers in the first round, 11th overall in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft while still in college.\nFor the 1987–88 season, Young spent the majority of the season with the U.S. National team. In addition to playing on the national team Young played in the 1988 Winter Olympics and made his debut with the Whalers, playing in seven games. The following season he played full-time with the Whalers, scoring 59 points in 79 games. Young played one more full season with the Whalers and played half of the 1990–91 season with the Whalers before being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Young helped the Penguins win the Stanley Cup in 1991.\nFor the 1991–92 season Young spent the majority of the year playing in Italy in addition to a brief stint with the U.S. National Team and representing the U.S. in the 1992 Winter Olympics.

The main structure was an open-air stadium that held roughly 10,000 fans, and a second show court held roughly 2,000. The site had six courts for play, and 4 practice courts (used for housing player facilities). \nBy the end of the 2000s, the wooden bench seating in the main stadium and the small grounds (boxed in by Steeles Avenue on the north, parking lots to the west and south and historic Jacob Stong House and Barn to the east) were deemed too small for the growing tournament and was not suitable for tier one tennis tours. Pressure from the ATP and the WTA Tours collectively forced the building of a new site on the west end of York University.\nIts final event was the 2003 Rogers AT&amp;T Cup women's tournament. The stadium was torn down and replaced by the Rexall Centre, located to the west of this site the following year. The centre court has been demolished with area fenced off, but the eight outer courts are still present (two other courts are covered over).

        "text": "Alan Bernard Mills (born October 18, 1966) is an American former relief pitcher and pitching coach. He spent 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees (1990–1991), Baltimore Orioles (1992–1998, 2000–2001) and Los Angeles Dodgers (1999–2000). He pitched right-handed.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Lakeland, Florida, on October 18, 1966, Mills was the youngest of Hugh and Alfreddia Mills' four children. His favorite sport in his youth was football, but he switched to baseball after doctors informed him that he had only one kidney. He graduated from Kathleen High School in 1984. He was an outfielder on the school's varsity team before making the transition to pitcher. He attended Tuskegee University, but transferred to Polk Community College after one year when the former dropped baseball scholarships.\nHe was selected in the MLB Draft on two occasions in 1986, both times in phases that were discontinued later that year. He was chosen by the Boston Red Sox (13th overall) and California Angels (8th overall) in the first rounds of the regular phase of the January draft and the secondary phase of the June draft respectively. He decided to sign with the Angels over the Red Sox based on which team was willing to finance his final two years of college.\nMills spent just one season with the Salem Angels of the Northwest League, compiling a 6–6 record over fourteen starts, before the Angels sent him to the New York Yankees to complete a December 19, 1986, deal in which the Yankees sent Butch Wynegar to the Angels for Ron Romanick and a player to be named later.\nNew York Yankees.\nMills converted to a relief pitcher during his three seasons in the Yankees' farm system, going 12–24 with a 4.25 ERA and thirteen saves. With the Prince William Cannons of the Class A Carolina League in , Mills went 6–1 with a 0.91 ERA and seven saves to lead his team to their first Carolina League title. Though he had never pitched above A ball, his performance earned him and invitation to Spring training in .\nHe made his major league debut on April 14, pitching 2.2 scoreless innings against the Texas Rangers. Mills went 1–5 with a 4.15 ERA his rookie year splitting his time between the Yankees and triple A Columbus Clippers. For Columbus, he was 3–3 with a 3.38 ERA and six saves.\nMills spent most of in the minors, however, made two starts upon returning to the club in September. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a player to be named later during Spring training the following season.\nAs of 2021, Mills is the only Yankee to wear number 69 in a regular season game.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nMills emerged as a valuable member of the Orioles' bullpen upon his arrival in Baltimore. He went 10–4 with a 2.61 ERA over 103.1 innings in .\nMills made a team high 72 appearances in , going 3–4 with a 3.74 ERA. Perhaps the most famous moment of Mills' career came on May 19, , when he gave Darryl Strawberry a right cross that bloodied his face in the dugout during a bench clearing brawl with the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Strawberry had just hit Mills' teammate Armando Benítez with a cheap shot during a melee, and Mills promptly defended Benitez by clocking Strawberry point-blank.\nThe following season, Mills signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers. After a season and a half in Los Angeles, he was dealt back to the Orioles for Alberto Reyes. He remained with the Orioles through before being released. In a 12-season career, Mills posted a 39–32 record with 456 strikeouts and a 4.12 ERA in 474 games.\nMills wore jersey number 75 with the Orioles. Numbers that high are typically only worn by players in spring training (when teams have considerably larger rosters than they do during the regular season). Mills chose to wear it as a motivating factor, to remind himself that his job was not necessarily any more secure than that of someone in spring training should he perform poorly.\nErie SeaWolves.\nMills attempted comebacks with the Montreal Expos in Spring training and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in , but was essentially away from the game for five years before signing a minor league deal with the Detroit Tigers in , and spending one season with the Erie SeaWolves. In his first 27 games, he went 23-for-23 in save opportunities, posting a 2.79 ERA and limiting batters to a .154 batting average.\nPost-retirement.\nMills returned to his alma mater Kathleen High School as a physical education teacher and head coach of its varsity baseball team from 2009 through 2011. It was also during that time that he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology from Ashford University in 2009. He has also served as a pitching coach in the New York–Penn League for the Oneonta Tigers in 2008.\nHis return to the Orioles organization in 2012 began a five-year span as pitching coach with the Aberdeen IronBirds (2012–2013), Delmarva Shorebirds (2014) and Bowie Baysox (2015–2016). His 2012 and 2013 seasons with the IronBirds were the subject of a 2021 memoir called \"Clubbie\" from the team's clubhouse attendant, Greg Larson. His 2015 campaign with Bowie was the first time the Baysox captured the Eastern League Championship. After two seasons as the Orioles' bullpen coach in 2017 and 2018, he was announced as the manager of the GCL Orioles on February 8, 2019. Despite the Gulf Coast League cancelling its playoffs due to the threat of Hurricane Dorian, Mills was named Manager of the Year after guiding the Orioles to a league-best 38–15 record in his first full season at the helm. Team records were established or matched in winning percentage (.717) and wins respectively, with the latter tying the 2011 GCL Orioles. On October 4, 2021, Mills was fired by the Baltimore organization."

It is the only national team in the FIBA Americas zone that has won the quintuplet crown: FIBA World Cup (they won the first edition, in 1950), Olympic Gold Medal (2004) (the highest honor and most important title of Argentina in the history of Argentina Basketball Men's Senior National Team), FIBA Diamond Ball (2008), FIBA AmeriCup (2001, 2011 and 2022) and Pan American Gold Medal (1995, 2019 and 2023). They are also one of only four countries to have won the Olympic gold medal and FIBA World Cup joining the Soviet Union, the United States of America, and Yugoslavia. They have also won 13 South American Basketball Championships, as well as many youth championships.\nThe Argentine representative were also the first country to defeat a United States national team with a full squad of NBA players. They did so by 87–80 in the 2002 FIBA World Championship held in Indianapolis. In that tournament, Argentina came second behind FR Yugoslavia, losing the final in overtime.\nDue to the series of good results since the beginning of the 2000s (decade), Argentina reached the first position in the FIBA Men's Ranking at the end of the 2008 Olympic Games. Argentina is a founding member of the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA) and has South America's longest basketball tradition.\nHistory.\nThe practice of basketball in Argentina was started by \"Asociación Cristiana de Jóvenes (Young Men's Christians Association – YMCA)\" in 1912., with the first Federation (\"Federación Argentina\") established to organise competitions not only in Buenos Aires but in several cities around Argentina. \nArgentina played its first international game against Uruguay in 1921.\nIn 1950 Argentina won its first and only World Championship to date, with a squad formed entirely by amateur players, after defeating France (twice), Brazil, Chile, Egypt and the United States in the decisive match.\nWith the creation of the Liga Nacional de Básquet in the mid-1980s, a new generation of players led Argentina to a moderate success in the 1986 World Championship where the squad defeated United States for the first time in their history. Nevertheless, the progress of Argentine basketball would be shown in 2002 FIBA World Championship being the first team to defeat a United States roster composed entirely of NBA players and also reaching the final, finally losing to Yugoslavia.\n2001 was the year when the \"Golden Generation\" raised, winning the first Argentina's FIBA Americas Championship -held in Neuquen-, where they defeated all of its rivals in the competition. In 2002 the team made history by being the first team to defeat a United States roster composed entirely of NBA players during the 2002 FIBA World Championship. Argentina would reach the finals for the first time since the first World Championship in 1950, But the most important achievement for the squad came in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens when Argentina won their first gold medal (including another victory over the United States at the semi-finals). The Olympics title in 2004 is the higher honor and important title of Argentina in the history of the sport in the country.\nUniforms and suppliers.\nSince its establishment, the Argentina national team had worn white kits. The team had a long tenure wearing Topper, which was the official supplier since the 1970s to 2007. In 2002, two light blue horizontal stripes (similar to the National flag) were added to the jerseys. When the contract with Topper expired in 2007, the CABB signed an agreement with Chinese firm Li-Ning, which kept the design established by Topper.\nItalian company Kappa was the uniforms supplier since 2013.\nIn 2014 the company designed a vertical striped model in the style of football and field hockey representatives. The jersey debuted in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup. When Nike became official sponsor through its brand Air Jordan, the Argentina jersey returned to a simple white color scheme. The deal extended to 2020, when the American company ceased operations in Argentina.\nStarting in 2022, Spanish Kelme is the current kit provider for all the Argentina basketball teams.\nPlayers.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup.\nPast roster.\nRoster for the men's basketball tournament at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n&lt;section end=ARG /&gt;\nRetired numbers.\nIn July 2017, the Argentine Basketball Confederation announced that numbers 5 and 13 would be retired since the 2017 edition of FIBA AmeriCup and for the rest of championships played by the senior team from then on."

        "title": "1969 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1969 NBA World Championship Series to determine the champion of the 1968–69 NBA season was played between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics. The Lakers were heavily favored due to the presence of three formidable stars: Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, and Jerry West. In addition, Boston was an aging team; they made the playoffs as the fourth place team in the Eastern Division, and were not favored to make it to the finals. The Celtics' finals victory – the last championship of the Bill Russell dynasty – is considered one of the great upsets in NBA history.\nThis series is also notable in that West, with an average of nearly 38 points a game, won the Finals Most Valuable Player award, despite being on the losing team. This was the first year a Finals MVP award was given, and it remains the only time in NBA Finals history that the MVP was awarded to a player on the losing team. It also marked the first time in NBA Finals history that a Game 7 was won by the road team.\nPrologue.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers had won 55 games in the regular season (2nd best to the Baltimore Bullets' 57 wins), seven more than their perennial rivals, the Boston Celtics, and therefore held homecourt advantage for the first time ever in an NBA Finals meeting vs. the Russell-led Celtics. Both teams had their share of problems in the regular season. Though the Lakers's acquisition of star center Wilt Chamberlain before the season prompted many observers to predict for them the title that had previously eluded them, their arrival at the Finals had not been easy; the season could have been described as a \"soap opera\"; Chamberlain and reigning Laker superstars Elgin Baylor and Jerry West had some difficulty in meshing their accustomed styles. Second-year coach Butch van Breda Kolff and Chamberlain also clashed terribly throughout the season, frustrating the entire team. In Boston, player-coach Bill Russell was suffering from age and exhaustion, hampering the team both as the starting center and as the coach. In addition, perennial scorer Sam Jones played so poorly that he lost his position as starting shooting guard to Larry Siegfried. The Lakers’ appearance in the Finals was expected, but they lost the first two games of the Western Division semifinals to the San Francisco Warriors on their home court before prevailing, and then outlasted the Atlanta Hawks 4 games to 1 to gain the rematch with the Celtics. Boston's campaign was considered a surprise. They upset the 2nd place 76ers and were fortunate that the 3rd place Knicks upset the 1st place Bullets; Boston then knocked off New York in the Eastern Division finals. In that series, the home team won all of its games, except for Game 7.\nOn the hardwood, there were several key matchups. At center, low scoring, defensive stalwart Celtics center Bill Russell was matched up against his long-time rival and friend Wilt Chamberlain (Lakers), multiple time scoring champion. At forward, agile Celtic Bailey Howell played against perennial All-NBA member Elgin Baylor, captain of the Lakers, while Laker Keith Erickson tried to slow down high-scoring Celtics forward John Havlicek. At guard, a somewhat revitalised Sam Jones was matched up against Lakers superstar Jerry West. X-factors on both teams respectively were Don Nelson, the sixth man of the Celtics, and sharpshooting Laker Johnny Egan, the only other pure guard besides West on the L.A. roster.\nSeries summary.\n\"Celtics win the series 4–3\"\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nPrior to the series, Celtics player-coach Bill Russell decided not to double-team Lakers star guard Jerry West. West was initially complaining of exhaustion, but in the game, all was forgotten. He used this freedom to score 53 points on opposing guards Sam Jones and Larry Siegfried. In an action-packed match, the lead changed 21 times, and it was Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain who sealed the game with a clutch basket 23 seconds before the end.\nGame 2.\nAgain, Russell declined to double-team West. In a tough, physical match, West continued his scoring dominance by scoring 41 points. Aided also by guard Johnny Egan, who scored 26 points, and 31 points from Elgin Baylor (among them the last 12 Lakers points), the Lakers won. Celtics forward Don Nelson and Lakers forward Bill Hewitt required a half-dozen stitches each after in-game collisions.\nGame 3.\nIn Game 3, Russell finally decided to double-team West. With the heightened pressure, West lost his shooting touch. Also, the exhaustion he was complaining about prior to the series became so apparent that he asked to be taken out for longer stretches. In both pauses, the Lakers fell back by double digits. The heroics belonged to Celtics forward John Havlicek: playing with a swollen eye after being poked by Keith Erickson, he scored 34 points.\nGame 4.\nGame 4 was an ugly affair, filled with 50 turnovers and low shooting percentages, but was the turning point in the series. The Lakers had a one-point lead with 7 seconds left and the ball. However, after receiving an inbound pass along the sideline, Baylor was controversially ruled to have stepped out of bounds, causing a turnover. For the last play, Celtics players Havlicek, Siegfried, Bailey Howell and Jones executed a so-called \"Ohio\", with the three former Ohio State Buckeye players setting a triple pick for the latter. Jones jumped off the wrong foot, but the ball avoided the block attempt of Lakers center Chamberlain, hit the front rim, bounced on the back rim and somehow dropped in for the series-equalizing buzzer beater. So instead of the Lakers going home with a 3-1 series lead, it was all even at 2 games apiece.\nGame 5.\nEnraged by the unlucky Game 4 loss, the Lakers overran the Celtics with high-power basketball. Wilt Chamberlain played through a swollen eye after Celtics guard Em Bryant had poked him. With just three minutes remaining and the Lakers safely ahead, Bryant stole the ball from West. Instead of letting Bryant run, he lunged for the ball, pulled his hamstring and had to be carried out of the game. It was immediately evident that West's swollen leg would not heal until the end of the series.\nGame 6.\nIn another ugly game, the Celtics were up 55–39 at halftime and never looked back. The Celtics at one point went 6-of-27 from the field, but the Lakers could not make use of this slump. With neither Baylor nor the limping West providing consistent scoring, Boston cruised to an easy victory. This game was also one of Chamberlain's lesser games: with Russell hounding him, the multiple scoring champion scored only 8 points, provoking criticism that he had choked when it counted most.\nGame 7.\nIn anticipation of a Lakers win, Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had ordered thousands of balloons with \"World Champion Lakers\" printed on them suspended from the rafters of the Forum. Flyers were placed in every seat stating, \"When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the rafters, the USC marching band will play \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.\" Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans. When Jerry West went to the court for a pre game shoot around and saw the balloons, he became furious with Cooke. Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, \"Those fucking balloons are staying up there.\" With only two true guards on the Laker roster and West still feeling the effects of the hamstring pull, Celtics coach Russell ordered his players to fast break at every opportunity.\nLos Angeles shot poorly in the early going, and the Celtics jumped out to a first-quarter 24–12 lead which was cut to 59–56 at halftime. Then, Celtics sixth man Don Nelson scored 12 points in the third quarter, while the Lakers hardly connected on a quarter of their field goal attempts: the Celtics led 91–76 after the third. Early in the fourth quarter, Chamberlain incurred his fifth foul (he had never fouled out of a game in his career) and had to play more tentative defense. Then, with just over 5 minutes remaining and the Lakers trailing 103–94, Chamberlain landed awkwardly when grabbing a rebound and came to the bench with an injured knee. Behind backup center Mel Counts, the Lakers cut the lead to 103–102 with two minutes left. Chamberlain then informed Van Breda Kolff that he was ready to return, but the coach infamously told the superstar center \"we're doing fine without you\", and Chamberlain stayed on the bench. Boston still held the 103–102 lead with 1:33 left in the game when reserve guard Keith Erickson knocked the ball away from John Havlicek. The ball went right to Don Nelson, who put up a desperation 18 foot shot from the free throw line to beat the 24 second clock; the ball hit the back rim, bounced high in the air and fell through the hoop to give Boston a 105–102 lead. The Lakers committed costly turnovers in the last moments and trailed 108–104 before making a meaningless last second shot that made the final score 108–106."

        "text": "Allen Kent Berry (born May 10, 1941) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from through , most notably as a member of the Chicago White Sox. The two-time Gold Glove winner was an American League All-Star player in 1967. He also played for the California Angels, Milwaukee Brewers and the Cleveland Indians. In 2015, Berry was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame.\nCareer.\nBerry was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and attended Washburn Rural High School in Topeka, Kansas, where he starred in football, basketball and track and field. After graduating from High School in 1959, he continued to play football and basketball as a freshman while attending Wichita State University. Berry also played one year in a work/play program for the McPherson (Kansas) BJs in the Ban Johnson League. That year McPherson went to the National Ban Johnson League tournament finals played in Wichita.\nBerry was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent before the 1961 season. He made his major league debut with the White Sox at the age of 21 on September 9, 1962. He was named to the American League All-Star team in 1967, when his White Sox battled the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Minnesota Twins for the pennant all the way down to the last few days of the season.\nHe led league outfielders in putouts once (1965) and in fielding percentage three times (1970, 1972, and 1973). He tied for the league lead once each in assists and double plays, both in 1972. After a campaign in which he batted .276 with 50 runs batted in (RBI) and 7 home runs, Berry was traded along with Syd O'Brien and Billy Wynne from the White Sox to the Angels for Jay Johnstone, Tom Egan and Tom Bradley on November 30, 1970. He was involved in a nine-player transaction three years later when he was sent along with Steve Barber, Clyde Wright, Art Kusnyer and cash from the Angels to the Brewers for Ellie Rodríguez, Ollie Brown, Joe Lahoud, Skip Lockwood and Gary Ryerson on October 23, 1973. He played in his final major league game at the age of 34 with the Indians on May 31, 1975.\nDuring the 1967 baseball season when the White Sox were battling the Red Sox for the pennant, Berry made the final out in a 4-3 loss when he was tagged out at home plate by Elston Howard after he tried score on a line drive to right field that was caught by Jose Tartabull. Not known for having a strong arm, Tartabull’s throw sailed high and was caught by a leaping Howard who blocked the plate with his left foot as he came down, and swipe tagged Berry ending the game. For Red Sox fans, the play was considered a key event during their ”Impossible Dream” season.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a fourteen-year major league career, Berry played in 1,384 games, accumulating 1,053 hits in 4,136 at bats for a .255 career batting average along with 58 home runs, 343 runs batted in and a .308 on-base percentage. He ended his career with a .989 fielding percentage. A good defensive player, he led American League outfielders three times in fielding percentage.\nCareer highlights include: \nPersonal life.\nIn 1988, he played the heckler in the film \"Eight Men Out\".\nIn 2012, Berry---now a grandfather---published two children's books, \"Artie the Awesome Apple\" and \"Clyde the Clumsy Camel\". He told the \"Topeka Capital-Journal\" he began writing the books in December 2011 and kept on after his wife told him they were \"not bad.\" The newspaper said Berry often entertained his children on long drives to spring training by making up stories about three friendly ghosts.\nBerry was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 2015.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

He was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played on two major league teams for 14 seasons, from 1959 through 1972. He was one of the best-hitting pitchers of his era.\nMajor league baseball.\nThe Chicago White Sox signed Peters as an amateur free agent in after he graduated from Grove City College. After four brief call-ups, he got a pitching job on the White Sox in , winning 19 games (19–8) and the American League Rookie of the Year Award. A left-handed pitcher, he led the American League in earned run average in 1963 and 1966, with the most wins in 1964. In 1965, he was limited by a bad back. Tommy John, who lived with him part of the year, recalled that Peters had to sleep on a mattress on the floor and could not stand up straight in the mornings.

He had a .222 lifetime batting average and hit 19 home runs and 102 RBI. He was frequently used as a pinch-hitter, once winning a game with a pinch-hit home run. On May 5, 1968, Peters hit a grand slam in Comiskey Park, helping the White Sox to a 5–1 victory over the New York Yankees. He was also used as a pinch-runner.\nPeters was a big practical joker. Once, when the White Sox went to play the Los Angeles Angels, they found themselves at the same hotel as the Yankees, who had not left for their next destination yet. Obtaining the key to Joe Pepitone's room, Peters snuck into the hitter's room in the middle of the night and started jumping on the bed and screaming, scaring the hitter tremendously until Pepitone finally got the lights turned on and figured out what had happened. Another time, he caught a baby octopus while skindiving and threw it at Ed Stroud in the locker room the next day.\nOn September 30, 2000, the Chicago White Sox announced that Gary Peters and 26 other former and active White Sox players were members of the Chicago White Sox All-Century Team.\nPersonal life and death.\nOn January 26, 2023, it was announced that Peters had died at the age of 85.\nExternal links.\n, or SABR Biography Project"

        "title": "Al Downing (baseball)",
        "text": "Alphonso Erwin Downing (born June 28, 1941) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics, Milwaukee Brewers, and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1961 through 1977. Downing was an All Star in 1967 and the National League's Comeback Player of the Year in 1971. Downing allowed Hank Aaron's record breaking 715th home run on April 8, 1974.\nEarly life.\nDowning was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He participated in the Police Athletic League. Downing attended Trenton Central High School, Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Rider College in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He also played baseball as a semi-professional.\nNew York Yankees.\nDowning signed with the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1961, and was promoted to the major league roster by July of that season. In 1963, his first full major league season, Downing had a 13–5 win–loss record with a 2.56 earned run average (ERA) for a Yankee team that went 104–57, but were swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1963 World Series. In 1964, he went 13–8 with a 3.47 ERA, and led the league with 217 strikeouts.\nDowning was 9–5 with a 2.66 ERA when he made his only All-Star team in 1967. He pitched two innings, giving up no earned runs while striking out two. On August 11, 1967, Downing struck out all three batters on nine total pitches in the second inning of a game against the Cleveland Indians; it was the first immaculate inning in the major leagues since 1964.\nInjuries limited Downing to only twelve starts in 1968. In 1969, Yankees manager Ralph Houk began using Downing out of the bullpen more, as he made fifteen starts and fifteen relief appearances. He was traded to the Oakland Athletics prior to the 1970 along with catcher Frank Fernández for Danny Cater and Ossie Chavarria.\nNL Comeback Player of the Year.\nOakland traded Downing and Tito Francona to the Milwaukee Brewers on June 11, 1970, for Steve Hovley. Despite a respectable 3.34 ERA, Downing's record was 2–10 for a Brewers team that narrowly escaped losing 100 games (97). For the season, Downing went 5–13 with a 3.52 ERA and 79 strikeouts in 27 games and 22 starts between his two teams.\nPrior to the start of the 1971 season, the Brewers traded Downing to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Andy Kosco. In his first season in the National League (NL), Downing won twenty games, and pitched a league-leading five shutouts. He earned NL Comeback Player of the Year honors as well as finishing third in NL Cy Young Award balloting behind Ferguson Jenkins and Tom Seaver.\nOn April 8, 1974, Downing allowed a home run to Hank Aaron that was the 715th of his career, breaking the all-time record set by Babe Ruth. Downing made his third, and final post-season appearance that season. His Dodgers lost four games to one to the Oakland A's. Downing played two more full seasons with the Dodgers, and was released during the 1977 season with a 0–1 record and 6.75 ERA.\nBroadcasting career.\nDowning served as a color analyst on Dodgers cable-TV broadcasts from 1980 to 1987 and on Dodgers radio in 2005. He also broadcast for CBS Radio in the 1990s, and the Atlanta Braves in 2000. As of 2006, he remains on the Dodgers Speaker's Bureau."

        "title": "Swimming pool reactor",
        "text": "A swimming pool reactor, also called an open pool reactor, is a type of nuclear reactor that has a core (consisting of the fuel elements and the control rods) immersed in an open pool usually of water.\nThe water acts as neutron moderator, cooling agent and radiation shield. The layer of water directly above the reactor core shields the radiation so completely that operators may work above the reactor safely. This design has two major advantages: the reactor is easily accessible and the whole primary cooling system, \"i.e.\" the pool water, is under normal pressure. This avoids the high temperatures and great pressures of nuclear power plants. Pool reactors are used as a source of neutrons and for training, and in rare instances for processing heat but not for electrical generation.\nDescription.\nOpen pools range in height from 6m to 9m (20' to 30') and diameter from 1.8m to 3.6m (6' to 12'). Some pools, like the one at the Canadian MAPLE reactor, are rectangular instead of cylindrical and often contain as much as 416,000 litres (110,000 gallons) of water. Most pools are built above floor level but some are completely or partially below ground. Ordinary (light) water- and heavy water-only types exist as well as so-called \"tank in pool\" designs that use heavy water moderation in a small tank situated in a larger light water pool for cooling. Life preservers are sometimes located around the facility to rescue personnel that may fall into the pool, further adding to the appearance of a swimming pool-like environment.\nNormally the reactor is charged with low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel consisting of less than 20% U-235 alloyed with a matrix such as aluminium or zirconium. Highly enriched uranium (HEU) was the fuel of choice since it had a longer lifetime, but these have been largely phased out of non-military reactors to avoid proliferation issues. However most often 19.75% enrichment is used, falling just under the 20% level that would make it highly enriched. Fuel elements may be plates or rods with 8.5% to 45% uranium. Beryllium and graphite blocks or plates may be added to the core as neutron reflectors and neutron absorbing rods pierce the core for control. General Atomics of La Jolla, CA manufactures TRIGA reactor fuel elements in France for the majority of these types of reactors around the world. Core cooling is accomplished either by convection induced by the hot core or in larger reactors by forced coolant flow and heat exchangers.\nVarious stations for holding items to be irradiated are located inside the core or directly adjacent to the core. Samples may be lowered into the core from above or delivered pneumatically via horizontal tubes from outside the tank at core level. Evacuated, or helium filled horizontal tubes may also be installed to direct a beam of neutrons to targets situated at a distance from the reactor hall.\nApplications.\nMost research reactors are of the pool type. These tend to be low power, low maintenance designs. For example AECL's SLOWPOKE is licensed to run unattended for up to 18 hours. Boron neutron capture therapy is another, medical use."

        "title": "Shaun King (American football)",
        "text": "Shaun Earl King (born May 29, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Tulane Green Wave and was selected in the second round of the 1999 NFL draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. King was also a member of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, as well as the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League (AFL), and Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\nAfter his playing career, he was an assistant college coach for the South Florida Bulls. He later became an afternoon co-host on the Las Vegas sports wagering channel, VSiN.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from Gibbs High School in 1995, King played college football at Tulane University from 1995 to 1998, leading Tulane to an undefeated season and a win over Brigham Young University in the Liberty Bowl, in the process setting the then single-season NCAA Division I-A record for passing efficiency in 1998 of 183.3. In the same year he became the first player in NCAA history to both pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game against Army on November 14. His quarterback coach was Rich Rodriguez and his head coach was Tommy Bowden. He finished 10th in voting for the 1998 Heisman Trophy. King is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. King co-captained the 1998 12-0 Green Wave along with right tackle Dennis O'Sullivan. The style of offense that King ran at Tulane under Bowden was the Spread offense which is now a very popular style in NCAA football.\nCollege Football Statistics\nProfessional career.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nKing was drafted in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his hometown team. Near the midpoint of the 1999 season, quarterback Trent Dilfer suffered a season-ending injury, thrusting King into the starting quarterback role.\nKing took over the offense, and helped rally the team to the NFC Central title, and a victory over the Redskins in the divisional playoffs. A week later, the team fell just short of Super Bowl XXXIV when they lost the NFC Championship 11–6 to the St. Louis Rams with King at the helm.\nKing's best professional season was in 2000, when he started all sixteen regular-season games for the Buccaneers. A thrilling rematch against the Rams on \"Monday Night Football\" proved to be one of King's most memorable games. Trailing 35–31 with 1:21 remaining, Tampa Bay faced a 4th and 4 at the 29-yard line. King was tripped up, but scrambled 6 yards for a first down. Four plays later, Tampa Bay scored the game-winning touchdown, the seventh lead change of the game, and clinched a playoff berth. A win in week 17 would clinch a second consecutive division title and a first-round bye in the playoffs, potentially propelling Tampa Bay to their first Super Bowl appearance. King did his part leading the offense into position for a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation. However, the usually reliable Martín Gramática missed the kick. The Buccaneers fell in overtime to the Green Bay Packers, and ultimately lost to the Eagles in the wild card round. King did have an extremely productive season for a young QB leading his team to a 10–6 record and throwing for 18 tds (with only 13ints) and rushing for 5 more.\nAfter the disappointing end to the 2000 NFL season, King was replaced by Brad Johnson for 2001 and relegated to a backup role for the following three seasons. In the 2002 season, Brad Johnson was injured and missed a game against the Carolina Panthers. Rob Johnson started at quarterback, but struggled to lead the offense, which managed to tie the game at 9-9 late in the fourth quarter. After a hard hit, Rob Johnson had to sit out a play on the final drive, prompting a cold-off-the-bench Shaun King to run in suddenly and throw an unexpected and decisive first down. A few plays later, Martín Gramática scored the game winning field goal.\nA few weeks later, starter Brad Johnson was injured once again, and King was placed as the starter against the Pittsburgh Steelers on \"Monday Night Football\". After some fanfare, King had a dismal first half, falling behind 14–0 after two quick turnovers. King was benched, and Rob Johnson salvaged a 17–7 loss. King would not play another down for the Buccaneers that season, as they advanced to the postseason. He suited up as the #3 quarterback for Tampa Bay's victory in Super Bowl XXXVII, but did not play in the game. King returned as the backup quarterback in 2003, but only appeared in three games, starting none. His final game as a Buccaneer was in the final week against the Titans. The Buccaneers, already eliminated from playoff contention, had fallen behind early, and King took over in the second half to wind up the disappointing season.\nAfter Tampa Bay.\nIn 2004, King signed with the Arizona Cardinals as a free agent, he started only two games and was released at the end of the season. In his first start against the Carolina Panthers he threw for 343 yards which was a season high for the Cardinals.\nKing signed a free agent contract with the Detroit Lions in spring 2006, but asked to be released after the Lions signed Josh McCown and Jon Kitna. On Friday June 2, 2006, he signed a free agent contract with the Indianapolis Colts, but was then released as a free agent on September 3.\nOn Friday November 29, 2006, King signed with the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League. He threw 10 touchdowns against the Grand Rapids Rampage on March 8, 2007, but was released by the team after a 1–5 start on April 10 of the same year.\nOn May 30, 2007, King signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League. King was released eighteen days later, so he could pursue a career in broadcasting.\nPost-playing.\nThe Shaun King Foundation, headquartered in Winter Haven, Florida, is the principal supporter for the Kings Kids program in partnership with Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, St. Petersburg, Florida\nKing has worked as an NFL and college football analyst for NBC Sports and Yahoo. In July 2008, King, working as an ESPN analyst, commented that it was \"outside of normal\" that recently released African-American NFL quarterbacks like Daunte Culpepper, Aaron Brooks, Byron Leftwich and himself were not signed to new teams.\nHe is married and has two daughters and a son with his wife, Faith King.\nIn 2016, King joined the coaching staff of the South Florida Bulls a member of the American Athletic Conference. In 2016 as quarterback coach, he helped Quinton Flowers to his best season and AAC player of the year recognition. In 2017, Charlie Strong arrived and King was moved to coach the running backs at USF.\nwhere he helped D'Ernest Johnson to his best collegiate season. 247 Sports \nnamed King as Recruiter of the Year.\nIn 2021, King started to work as a host for VSiN, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He co-hosts the show, \"The Night Cap,\" with Tim Murray weeknights from 10 pm to 1 am ET.\nKing also works as an analyst next to play-by-play man Ben Wilson on the television broadcasts of the Vegas Knight Hawks of the Indoor Football League."

        "title": "1977 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 1977 NBA World Championship Series was the championship round of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 1976–77 season, and the culmination of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers played against the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers, with the 76ers holding home-court advantage. Their four regular season meetings had been split evenly, 2–2, with neither side winning away from home. The series was played under a best-of-seven format.\nThe 1976–77 NBA season started with the ABA–NBA merger. Portland had benefited from the resulting ABA dispersal draft as they acquired Spirits of St. Louis power forward Maurice Lucas to partner with Bill Walton, and Philadelphia had signed ABA All-Star and 3-time ABA MVP Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving, who had taken the New York Nets to the ABA title the previous year. In the 1977 NBA Finals, five of the ten starting players were former ABA players (Julius Erving, Caldwell Jones, George McGinnis, Dave Twardzik, and Maurice Lucas).\nWhile it was no surprise that Philadelphia had made it to the championship series, having posted the best record in the Eastern Conference (50-32), Portland's appearance in the finals was a mild surprise. Portland had joined the league in 1970 and it was making its playoff debut in its seventh season as the third best team in the Western Conference (49-33). It was also making its Finals debut after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in four close games in the Western Conference Finals to make this the second straight NBA Finals with at least one team making their first Finals appearance.\nThe series started 2-0 in favor of Philadelphia, but Portland rebounded in the next four games to become the second team to overcome a 2-0 deficit to win the Finals since the Boston Celtics in 1969 and the first to do so with four straight wins. No team would accomplish the feat again until 2006.\nBackground.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers franchise entered the NBA as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Buffalo Braves. Like most expansion teams, the Trail Blazers struggled, but in 1974, hope was on the way.\nSuperstar center Bill Walton, who led UCLA to an 86-4 record and two national titles in three years, was drafted first overall by the Trail Blazers in the 1974 NBA draft. The Trail Blazers missed the playoffs the next two seasons as Walton struggled with injuries, but continued to add key pieces, such as Dave Twardzik, Lloyd Neal, Lionel Hollins, and Maurice Lucas. In 1976, Jack Ramsay was hired as head coach, and with a fully healthy Walton, Portland made the playoffs for the first time in the 1976–77 season, winning 49 games. The 3rd seeded Blazers would defeat the Chicago Bulls in three games, the Denver Nuggets in six games, and then shockingly swept league MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in the conference finals.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers made it back to the playoffs in 1976, after missing the previous four years, which included a league-worst nine wins in the 1972–73 season. They acquired former ABA All-Star Julius Erving, late of the New York Nets, in the offseason. The 76ers won 50 games for the first time since 1969, defeated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game series, then advanced to the finals for the first time since by ousting the Houston Rockets in six games.\nRegular season series.\nBoth teams split the four-game series, each won by the home team.\nSeries summary.\n\"Trail Blazers win series 4–2\"\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nGame 1 started with a Dr. J windmill slam dunk off the opening tip, and never got much better for the Blazers, who committed 34 turnovers. Erving scored 33 points and Doug Collins had 30, as the 76ers won 107–101. Walton finished with 28 points and 20 rebounds.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 was an easy 107–89 win for the 76ers, who at one point scored 14 points in under 3 minutes. In the final 5 minutes, however, Philadelphia's Darryl Dawkins and Portland's Bob Gross both went up for a rebound and wrestled each other to the floor. Dawkins and Gross squared off and both benches cleared, including the coaches. In the middle of the fray, Maurice Lucas, in an act of team unity and in support of Gross, slapped Dawkins from behind and challenged him. Dawkins and Lucas were ejected, and Doug Collins needed four stitches after he caught a punch from Dawkins that had missed its target. Dawkins and Lucas were each fined $2,500. This brawl is commonly looked upon as the turning point in this series, as the Blazers unified and showed the Sixers that they wouldn't be humiliated.\nGame 3.\nThe series moved to Portland for the next two games, and game 3 got underway following a few tense moments as Lucas approached the Philadelphia bench before the game and offered his hand in friendship to Dawkins and the 76ers. The Blazers offense took charge of the game, and posted a 42-point fourth quarter to win 129–107. The turning point came early in the fourth with the score 91-87, when Walton tipped in an alley-oop pass from Bob Gross over Darryl Dawkins, who knocked him to the floor. Dave Twardzik then stole the Sixers' ensuing inbounds pass and found Walton, who was back on his feet, for another alley-oop dunk. Lucas had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and Walton contributed 20 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists.\nGame 4.\nPhiladelphia attempted to use George McGinnis and Caldwell Jones on the inside for Game 4, but Walton had other ideas, going on a shot-blocking frenzy. Portland quickly led the game by 17 points and never looked back, scoring 41 points in the third quarter and winning 130–98, the largest margin of victory in a game 4 in NBA history.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 returned to Philadelphia with the series tied 2–2. Philadelphia spent much of the first half fouling the Blazers, racking up 22 personal fouls and sending the half-time score into the 40s. The Blazers added another 40 points to their total in the third quarter, and with a little over 8 minutes left in the game, Portland led 91–69. Erving rallied his team late in the fourth, scoring 37 points himself, but the Sixers ultimately lost 110–104. Portland set numerous rebounding records for its team, 59 (48 defensive, team record) in all which stood until 1985, 24 (20 defensive, another team record) of which belonged to Walton alone; his team record still stands.\nGame 6.\nPortland, now leading the series 3–2, arrived back home for Game 6 in the middle of the night to a crowd of 5,000 fans waiting at the airport. With just 48 minutes separating the Blazers from their first championship, \"Blazermania\" had gripped the city. Philadelphia kept the game close throughout the first quarter, but were down by 15 at halftime after the Blazers netted 40 points in the second quarter. Erving tried in vain to force a game 7 for his team, scoring 40 points, but Bill Walton's 20 points, 23 rebounds, 7 assists and 8 blocks kept the game in Portland's hands, as Philadelphia's George McGinnis missed the game-tying jump shot with 4 seconds left for a heart-stopping 109–107 Portland win. The crowd stormed onto the court in a frenzy.\nBill Walton was named finals MVP and was called \"an inspiration\" by the defeated Julius Erving. Maurice Lucas later said of Walton's post-game thrown jersey that was sent into the rushing crowd of fans, \"if I had caught the shirt, I would have eaten it. Bill's my hero.\"\nPortland was awarded two trophies for winning the NBA Championship: The Walter A. Brown Trophy, which was kept by the winning team for only a year until the next NBA Finals; and a newly designed trophy later to be known as the Larry O'Brien Trophy which was now to be kept by the winning team with a new one produced at every NBA Finals since. The Walter A. Brown Trophy was retired shortly after this game.\nNotes.\nGame 6 in Portland was originally scheduled to start at 10:30a.m. PT (1:30p.m. ET) on Sunday morning, because CBS wanted to accommodate a golf telecast of the Kemper Open—such scheduling had been used in the 1976 NBA Finals, for Game 3 played in Phoenix. However, the NBA refused and CBS agreed to a noon start.\nDespite the fact that this was the Finals' clinching game, CBS cut away from their NBA coverage very quickly after the game ended, skipping the trophy presentation in the Portland locker room to instead televise the golf tournament. The only known footage of the trophy presentation was of Blazers head coach Jack Ramsay voicing his opinion about Bill Walton's performance in the NBA Finals."

        "text": "The England cricket team toured Pakistan from October to December 2005. England were looking to maintain the form that had taken them to second place in the ICC Test Championship, and to victory in the 2005 Ashes series at home to Australia, but they suffered a sharp reversal of fortune, losing the Test series 2–0 to Pakistan. Pakistan also won the one day series by 3–2. This would be England's last tour of Pakistan until 2022.\nSquads.\nEngland.\nThe England squad for the tour was as follows:\nTests.\nMichael Vaughan (Yorkshire); James Anderson (Lancashire); Ian Bell (Warwickshire); Paul Collingwood (Durham); Andrew Flintoff (Lancashire); Ashley Giles (Warwickshire); Steve Harmison (Durham); Matthew Hoggard (Yorkshire); Geraint Jones (Kent); Alex Loudon (Warwickshire); Kevin Pietersen (Hampshire); Liam Plunkett (Durham); Matt Prior (Sussex); Andrew Strauss (Middlesex); Marcus Trescothick (captain) (Somerset); Shaun Udal (Hampshire)\nMichael Vaughan suffered an injury in the second warm-up match against Pakistan A in Bagh-e-Jinnah, Lahore. He was replaced by Marcus Trescothick as captain for the 1st Test at Multan. Simon Jones of Glamorgan and Chris Tremlett of Hampshire were originally selected but withdrew due to injury on 4 October and 13 October respectively. Liam Plunkett of Durham was announced as a replacement for Jones on 11 October.

Chris Tremlett was named in the squad and withdrew through injury on 13 October. Udal and Ali were named as replacements. Ashley Giles (hip surgery) and Michael Vaughan (knee surgery) flew home before the ODI series started, with Bell staying in Pakistan and Blackwell coming in as a replacement. Kevin Pietersen played the first two ODIs, but withdrew with a rib injury on 13 December, and was not replaced.\nPakistan.\nFirst and Second Test:\nInzamam-ul-Haq (captain); Salman Butt; Shoaib Malik; Younis Khan; Mohammad Yousuf; Hasan Raza; Kamran Akmal; Danish Kaneria; Mohammad Sami; Naved-ul-Hasan; Shabbir Ahmed; Shoaib Akhtar; Mushtaq Ahmed; Asim Kamal; Shahid Afridi; Arshad Khan\nThird Test:\nInzamam-ul-Haq (captain); Salman Butt; Shoaib Malik; Younis Khan; Mohammad Yousuf; Hasan Raza; Kamran Akmal; Danish Kaneria; Mohammad Sami; Naved-ul-Hasan; Shoaib Akhtar; Mushtaq Ahmed; Asim Kamal; Mohammad Asif; Arshad Khan\nODIs.\nInzamam-ul-Haq (captain); Salman Butt; Shoaib Malik; Younis Khan; Mohammad Yousuf; Yasir Hameed; Kamran Akmal; Danish Kaneria; Mohammad Sami; Naved-ul-Hasan; Shoaib Akhtar; Mohammad Asif; Yasir Arafat; Shahid Afridi*; Arshad Khan; Abdul Razzaq\nSchedule.\nThe England team arrived in Pakistan on 26 October and left on 22 December. The schedule was as follows:\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nEngland failed to chase a target of under 200 runs for the first time since the fourth Test of the 1998-99 Ashes, as Danish Kaneria and Shoaib Akhtar shared seven wickets to bowl England out in three spurts at Multan. Pakistan took their first victory over England at home since 1987-88, despite surrendering a first-innings lead of 144 and setting a target of 198 - and England were even 64/1 chasing that target. However, Kaneria removed Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell in the same over, before Paul Collingwood was lbw to Mohammad Sami in the next. England had gone from 64/1 to 67/4 - Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen added 26, before Kaneria struck again, as Flintoff swept him to Younis Khan. Eventually, they were 117/7, before Shaun Udal came in and added 49 with Geraint Jones - and then, Shoaib Akhtar bowled Jones for 33, leaving England to hit 33 for the last two wickets. Udal and Steve Harmison went in quick succession, and England finished on 175. Despite the efforts of the bowlers, it was Salman Butt who became Man of the Match, as his 122 in the second innings enabled Pakistan to set a target.\n2nd Test.\nPakistan won the toss and batted first, and scored heavily on the first day - with Shahid Afridi in particular punishing England's bowlers. After the first day, Pakistan had reached 300/4. The second day of the test contains a few dramatic incidents. Inzamam-ul-Haq was run out in controversial circumstances - he was adjudged to have his foot in the air while avoiding a direct shy at the stumps by Stephen Harmison. The laws of cricket state a player should not be given out if he is taking evasive action to avoid injury.\nAfter Pakistan were bowled out for 462, England began their reply. The next incident occurred when a gas canister exploded within the ground, damaging the boundary hoarding and some spectators nearby. Play was halted for around 15 minutes until authorities determined it was safe to continue. However, television footage subsequently showed that Shahid Afridi had deliberately scuffed up the wicket during this distraction - an action for which he was subsequently fined, and banned for one Test match and two One Day Internationals.\nAfter this distraction, England lost 2 quick wickets to end the day of 113/3. They recovered on day 3 through the efforts of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who both scored centuries. England were eventually bowled out for 446, and their bowlers made an improved effort in Pakistan's second innings, reducing them to 183/6 by the end of day 4. They could think about a possible victory, but Inzamam-ul-Haq was still at the wicket going into day 5.\nPakistan declared after Inzamam got his century, shortly before lunch on the fifth day, and in the sixth over England fell to 20/4. However, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff added 80 in 22 overs for the fifth wicket, and Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles held on for the draw.\n3rd Test.\nThe third and final test match at Lahore saw Pakistan enforcing their authority on the series off the back of the momentum they had built up by winning the first test and dominating most of the second one.\nEngland won the toss and chose to bat – and after a useful start where the openers put on 101, they were then regularly pegged back by Pakistan to end the day on 248/6. Criticism was levelled at the English batsmen for getting out to some injudicious shots. The use of the sweep shot came in for particular attention, as 5 batsmen lost their wicket attempting such a shot. Despite a battling 96 by Paul Collingwood, England were bowled out for 288.\nPakistan initially struggled in their reply, losing two very early wickets to be 12/2 at lunch on day 2, and they lost their 3rd wicket before the score reached 100. However, Inzamam-ul-Haq continued his dominance over England's attack, and only left the crease due to a hand injury. Mohammad Yousuf also built on his good form, and profited from being dropped on 16. In fact, he would eventually bat through the entire third day, which was an awful one for England where their only success was the wicket of the nightwatchman, Shoaib Akhtar, and that was only after he had made a score of 38.\nMohammad Yousuf and Kamran Akmal put on 269 runs for the fifth wicket, with Yousuf scoring a career best 223. Akmal scored 154 which was also a career best. England then faced the daunting prospect of the return of Inzamam after his injury, returning to resume his innings nearly 2 days after he had left the crease. Inzamam returned to play some expansive strokes with the lower order, and accelerate the scoring to an extent that it would be impossible for England to win the game. He was eventually run out on 97 just before lunch on the 4th day, and he immediately declared his side's innings on an enormous 636/8.\nEngland by this point were shattered, withdrawn and dispirited. Although Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell produced a determined rearguard effort in the second innings, putting on 175 for the third wicket, England would not be able to bat out the match. They slumped from 205/3 to 248 all out, to lose the match by an innings and 100 runs. Danish Kaneria and Shoaib Akhtar were the stand out bowlers involved in the collapse, recording figures of 4/52 and 5/71 respectively.\nPakistan and their supporters were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to ask of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes was by no means the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nEngland recorded their second win on tour, and their first over Pakistan, after winning the toss and batting to set a target that was eventually too big for Pakistan to chase down. England's openers, Marcus Trescothick and Matt Prior (who played his second ODI), added 43 before Trescothick lobbed a catch to Danish Kaneria, but Prior went on to make a career-best 45 before Mohammad Sami had him out lbw. After 25 overs, England had made 131/2, but Strauss and Pietersen then added 50 in four overs before Pietersen was stumped off a wide ball from Shoaib Malik. His 56 off 39 balls, however, had brought the average English run rate above 6, and it never fell below 5.75 from then on. Though Strauss was eventually caught off Kaneria's bowling - six short of his third ODI century - Flintoff added 90 with Paul Collingwood in the last 11 overs, and England had totalled 327/4, Flintoff hitting three sixes on his way to an unbeaten 72.\nHowever, his bowling leaked runs at a rate quicker than the target rate, with the first four overs costing 41 runs after he had come on as first change bowler for James Anderson, who had dismissed Kamran Akmal with the eleventh ball of the match. Salman Butt and Younis Khan shared a stand of 117 runs at a rate of 6.75 per over, but mid-innings England's slowest bowlers came to the fore. Ian Blackwell bowled ten overs without conceding a boundary, ending without a wicket but conceding 45 runs, while Paul Collingwood dismissed Inzamam-ul-Haq as the latter mistimed a guide to third man into the gloves of Geraint Jones who held the catch on the second attempt. With ten overs remaining, Pakistan needed 88 with six wickets in hand, with Harmison, Flintoff and ODI debutant Liam Plunkett bowling. Plunkett was the first to get a wicket, dismissing Mohammad Yousuf after an 83-run stand (off 96 balls) with Shoaib Malik, but Abdul Razzaq hit Flintoff for 11 off the four balls he faced in the next over, and with five overs remaining Pakistan needed 51. However, both the recognised batsmen were out in the next over to Plunkett, as the debutant finished with 3/51 (all caught), and Shoaib Akhtar was run out on the final ball of the over. Flintoff got two wickets in the 47th over to end the chase, but Strauss was named Man of the Match for his innings of 94, which included partnerships with every batsman except Trescothick and Collingwood. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n2nd ODI.\nPakistan levelled the series after their wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal hit his second ODI century - indeed, his second score above 50. However, it was Shoaib Akhtar who became Man of the Match, after removing Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss in the same over and coming back to take three more wickets while bowling. England had won the toss and batted first, and after an opening stand of 30 between Trescothick and Matt Prior Shoaib took two wickets in an over. Another stand of 44 took England to 74 after 13 overs, but Rana Naved-ul-Hasan repeated Shoaib's feat, and a full ball from Abdul Razzaq took care of Prior for 32.\nShoaib returned for two more wickets, and when Paul Collingwood chipped a return catch to Danish Kaneria England were 130/8 with 20 overs still to bat. They had little option but to put on their Super Sub Vikram Solanki, a specialist batsman, for bowler James Anderson - Solanki joined in with Liam Plunkett, who hit a maiden fifty in his second ODI for England, as the two shared a 100-run partnership. However, Plunkett and Steve Harmison were out in successive balls in the penultimate over, and England set a target of 230 on a pitch that had been described as \"flat and perfect for batting\". As it turned out, it wasn't enough - Flintoff, Harmison and Collingwood got a wicket each, but the Pakistani batsmen hit 34 boundaries in total - 138 of 231 runs - with Akmal sharing two 70+ stands, the opening with Salman Butt, and a third-wicket one with Mohammad Yousuf (who hit 28 off 68 balls) to carry Pakistan to 187/3 before he pulled a Harmison short ball to Solanki for 102. By that time, though, Pakistan needed 44 in 13.3 overs, and Inzamam-ul-Haq hit six fours in an unbeaten 31 as Pakistan made it to the target with six overs to spare. (Cricinfo scorecard)\n3rd ODI.\nKamran Akmal made his second century in three days to help Pakistan take a 2–1 lead in the series with two games to play, and their highest ODI victory by runs since their group match with Hong Kong at the 2004 Asia Cup. It was also their highest ODI win against a Full Member nation of the ICC since a 182-run win over South Africa in December 2002. England equalled their heaviest defeat ever with this loss. Pakistan were put in to bat after Marcus Trescothick won the toss, but England's bowlers did not back up the faith Trescothick had in them, not taking a wicket in the first 15 overs, before Liam Plunkett took two wickets in three balls, dismissing Younis Khan for the lowest score of the match, with 0. However, Plunkett was taken for 61 in his seven overs, and though he got the most wickets he was the least economical. Neither he nor Steve Harmison could stop the Pakistani pair of Akmal and Mohammad Yousuf, as the two added 104 in 16.2 overs before Kamran was caught off Paul Collingwood for 109. Mohammad Yousuf, who batted well for 68 off 65, was then responsible for two run-outs – his own, and that of the big-hitting Shahid Afridi, who creamed 31 off 14 balls. However, this was surpassed by Abdul Razzaq, who battered five fours and three sixes in a blazing 51 off 22 balls. At one stage, Razzaq looked poised to get the fastest ODI fifty, but some good death-over bowling from Andrew Flintoff, who was the best of the English bowlers, ensured that this at least would not happen. The Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq provided Razzaq with good support as he made 45 off 35.\nWhen England batted, no partnership lasted more than ten overs, and after a run out and two wickets from Rana Naved-ul-Hasan in the eighth over, they failed to chase the target. England were ahead of Pakistan by runs at the 15-over mark, having made 72/3 compared to Pakistan's 71/0, but Andrew Strauss was then lbw to an inswinging ball from Mohammad Sami, and Andrew Flintoff departed three overs later, bowled by Yasir Arafat, whom he had earlier hit for three fours in an over. With two more wickets falling, England brought on Ian Bell as a substitute, and though he made an unbeaten 37, the highest score of the innings, his batting partners could not pass 20, and England were bowled out for 188 eight overs before the end.\n4th ODI.\nDespite restricting Pakistan to a below par 210 on a difficult pitch to bat on, England fell 13 runs short against an efficient Pakistan bowling attack.\n5th ODI.\nEngland successfully defended an average total of 206 to win a close game by 6 runs."

A 6'8\" forward/center from Alcorn State University, Smith spent 13 seasons (1980–1993) in the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing for the Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets, and San Antonio Spurs. Smith, nicknamed \"Mr. Mean\", received NBA All-Rookie Team Honors in 1981, and would become one of the best rebounders of the 1980s. He had career averages of 9.2 rebounds and 25.9 minutes per game.\nSmith was affectionally nicknamed and known as \"Mr. Mean\" throughout his career, especially during his time with the Warriors, due to the stark contrast between him being nice and soft-spoken off the court but always with a serious demeanor and angry scowl on the court while grabbing a rebound. Smith's popularity in Golden State and Houston led to local fan clubs who would attend games wearing hard hats holding up a sign saying \"Larry's Local 13\". At the end of his career, Smith earned praise from the Houston Rockets coaching staff and fanbase for adequately covering for an injured Hakeem Olajuwon.\nHe worked as an assistant coach for Rudy Tomjanovich with the Rockets from 1993 until 2002, helping them capture their back-to-back NBA titles in 1993-94 and 1994-95. After ten years with the Rockets, Smith was hired as the assistant coach for the Atlanta Hawks in 2003. In 2004, he was hired by the Los Angeles Lakers to be the assistant coach for Tomjanovich. However, Tomjanovich resigned after 41 games into the 2004–05 season. Smith remained as an assistant coach for interim head coach Frank Hamblen until the end of the season.\nAfter serving as an assistant coach of the Albuquerque Thunderbirds, as the head coach of the Anaheim Arsenal, and as an assistant coach for the Austin Toros in the NBA D-League, Smith was hired to be an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) for the 2008 season.\nOn May 8, 2008, officials made the announcement during a news conference in Vicksburg, Mississippi that Smith has been named as the head basketball coach for Alcorn State University. In 2011, Smith was moved from this position to become director of athletic development for the school."

        "title": "Mark Davis (basketball, born 1960)",
        "text": "Mark Davis (born December 23, 1960) is an American-Australian former professional basketball player. He most notably played in the National Basketball League for the Adelaide 36ers between 1985 and 2001, gaining the nickname of \"The Chairman of the Boards\" for his record-breaking rebounding achievements.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Davis became an Australian citizen in 1992.\nCollege career.\nDavis spent two seasons with the St. Augustine's Falcons. In his senior season in 1982–83, he averaged 20.5 points per game.\nProfessional career.\nDavis' first professional gig came in 1984, playing for Hamilton in the New Zealand NBL. There, he was named rebounding champion. He then spent the 1984–85 season playing in Mexico for Dorados de Chihuahua where he helped the team win the championship.\nIn 1985, Davis moved to Adelaide where he joined both the South Adelaide Panthers of the SA State League. According to long time 36ers and Panthers teammate Scott Ninnis, Davis was actually the Panthers 2nd choice and was only recruited to the club after 6'9\" (205 cm) American centre Bill Coon left after just 4 days in Adelaide.\nDavis then came to the attention of 36ers' coach Ken Cole after dominating performances for the Panthers. Davis was signed by the 36ers five games into the 1985 NBL season and made an immediate impact, forming the league's leading front-court combination with Peter Ali and fellow import Bill Jones. Davis made his NBL debut for Adelaide on 4 May 1985 in a Round 4 clash with the Bankstown Bruins at the Apollo Stadium in Adelaide. He showed he would be a player to be reckoned with by top scoring for the home side with 32 points while grabbing 14 rebounds in a 117–110 Adelaide win. Davis won the club's MVP award after averaging 27.9 points, 17.6 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game. He scored a season-high 42 points (which would remain the 36ers single game record until beaten by Darryl Pearce with a 48-point game in 1988) in Adelaide's 144–112 win over St Kilda in Melbourne, while his season-high rebound game was again at home against the Canberra Cannons when he pulled down 29 boards, just two shy of the 36ers record of 31 held by Dan Clausen. The 36ers, including guards Al Green, Darryl Pearce and Mike McKay, made its first Grand Final appearance that season against the Brisbane Bullets but did not win.\nBy the start of the 1986 NBL season, Davis was already regarded as the premier power forward in the country, and with a team leading 25.3 points and 16.1 rebounds per game, led the 36ers to their second straight Grand Final in 1986 on a back of a 24–2 record (including going 13–0 at the Apollo Stadium). Davis went on to lead the 36ers to the championship in three games over the Bullets in the NBL's inaugural Grand Final series, winning the NBL's inaugural Grand Final MVP award in the process. Although he was a power forward, Davis was named at centre in the All-NBL First Team for 1986 – the first of 5 times he was named to the All NBL team.\nFollowing the 36ers championship win over Brisbane, Davis spent the off-season playing for the Long Island Knights in the United States Basketball League (USBL) before returning to Adelaide for the start of the 1987 NBL season. Davis' great form continued in 1987 and he was rewarded when he was named joint NBL Most Valuable Player with Brisbane's Leroy Loggins, while also gaining All-NBL First Team honours. Davis averaged 26.1 points and 17.5 rebounds in his MVP season and 1987 saw the 36ers finish the regular season in first place, but the defending champions were upset in a three-game semi-final series against the emerging Perth Wildcats. The season was also the first year that Davis led the league in total rebounding – an achievement he would repeat in 1992 and would lead to his nickname \"Chairman of the Boards\".\nIn 1990, Davis was named captain of the 36ers by new coach (and long time 36ers assistant coach) Don Shipway. 1990 would also be the first time since 1983 that the 36ers would miss the NBL Finals. With Davis leading the way, along with new point guard Butch Hays, 6'10\" (208 cm) centres Mark Bradtke and Brett Wheeler and guards Darryl Pearce and Mike McKay, the 36ers returned to the playoffs in 1991 but were bundled out in the Semi-finals by the Perth Wildcats.\nThe 36ers won a place in the 1994 Grand Final series against the North Melbourne Giants, though Davis' impact was limited after suffering a dislocated shoulder in Game 1 of Adelaide's Semi-finals series sweep of the reigning NBL champion Melbourne Tigers. In the 3rd period of the game, Davis had grabbed a defensive rebound and as he prepared to throw a long pass for a fast break, Tigers forward Dave Simmons attempted to swat the ball away but collected his right arm instead, instantly dislocating his shoulder. With the team missing his scoring and rebounding (he averaged 21.7 points and 12.9 rebounds in the regular season and had averaged 16.5 points and 11.3 rebounds in the playoffs), the 36ers produced a hard-fought win in Game 2 in Melbourne. Davis underwent intense physio treatment in order to be ready for the Grand Final series against the Giants and did return to the side for the series, but ultimately the 36ers were swept in two games. 1994 would also be the first time that the name Mark Davis would not appear on the club's MVP award as new recruit (and the reigning NBL MVP from 1993) Robert Rose won the award. To that point Davis had won every 36ers Club MVP award since 1985.\nDavis remained captain of the 36ers until the end of 1996 when he was replaced by Australian Boomers representative Brett Maher. He went on to win two more NBL championships (now as a sixth man) in 1998 and 1998–99. On 13 December 1999, in a 90–74 win over the Brisbane Bullets, Davis grabbed his 5,000th NBL rebound, becoming the first NBL player to reach the mark. Davis' rebounding record of 5,200 was broken by former 36ers teammate Mark Bradtke on 21 November 2003 in Adelaide, with Davis on hand to present Bradtke with the match ball.\nDavis is the 36ers' all-time leader in free throws made (2,037), free throws attempted (2,888), rebounds (5,200), and blocked shots (301).\nDavis also continued to play for the South Adelaide Panthers during his time with the 36ers. He won five championships with the Panthers and a record five Woollacott Medals.\nNational team career.\nAfter becoming an Australian citizen in 1992 and serving the FIBA required 3-year residency period, Davis was selected to play for the Australian Boomers in 1995, playing in the opening three games of a five-game series against the Magic Johnson All-Stars. Davis made his Boomers debut at home in Adelaide against the All-Stars on 7 March 1995.\nRetirement and basketball camp.\nDavis continues to call Adelaide home following his retirement and started up the \"Mark Davis Basketball Camp\" in 2004. Davis himself gives expert coaching with help from various past and present NBL/NBA players including Willie Simmons and Butch Hays, as well as personnel from the Adelaide Lightning and various Paralympians.\nHonours and Accolades.\nDavis is honoured as one of only four players to have their number retired by the Adelaide 36ers. His #33 jersey hangs in the rafters of Adelaide Arena, alongside #4 Darryl Pearce, #5 Brett Maher and #15 Al Green. Maher, who replaced Davis as 36ers captain in 1997 when Davis' career was winding down and his role changed from being a starter to the team's sixth man, also played his entire NBL career with the Adelaide 36ers. Just inside the main entrance to the Adelaide Arena, a bronze bust of Davis sits in place underneath a plaque giving a bio of Davis' achievements with the 36ers (\"pictured right)\".\nThe Adelaide 36ers club MVP award is named the \"Mark Davis Trophy\" in his honour. Davis was the first winner of the award in 1985 and won the award nine times conclusively up to and including 1993. Davis is also the only 36ers player to have won the NBL's MVP award. Davis (1986, 1998 and 1999), Brett Maher, Paul Rees, Rupert Sapwell and Jason Williams (all 1998, 1999 and 2002) are the only players to have won three or more NBL championships with the 36ers, while Davis (1986), Kevin Brooks (1998) and Brett Maher (1999 and 2002) are the only 36ers to win the Grand Final MVP award. Davis was also named in the NBL's 20th Anniversary Team in 1998 and its 25th Anniversary Team in 2003.\nDavis was inducted into the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 for his services to the NBL.\nIn March 2015, Davis' #33 was also retired by his local Adelaide club, the South Adelaide Panthers who he joined in 1985 and with whom he won the SA State League championship in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1995 and 1997 as winning a record 5 Woollacott Medals as the fairest and most brilliant player in South Australia. His number was retired along with the #8 of fellow Australian Basketball Hall of Fame member Michael Ah Matt, and the #9 of long time 36ers and Panthers championship winning teammate Scott Ninnis.\nIn November 2015 in an online poll conducted by Adelaide's daily newspaper \"The Advertiser\", Davis was selected at Power forward in the fans choice for the Adelaide 36ers best ever team. Davis polled the most votes from the fans (83.28%) for any position. The fans choice team was Mark Bradtke (centre), Davis (PF), Robert Rose (Small forward), Brett Maher (shooting guard) and Darnell Mee (Point guard), Phil Smyth (coach)."

        "title": "Ulf Nilsson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Ulf Gösta Nilsson (born 11 May 1950) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player who played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) for the Winnipeg Jets and in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New York Rangers. Nilsson won 2 Avco World Trophies as WHA champions with the Winnipeg Jets.\nCareer in North America.\nIn the early 1970s Nilsson was part of a group of hockey players who was tested on by Jerry Wilson, a Canadian former hockey player who was studying the physiology of hockey players, specifically their heart and lung conditioning. Wilson had been asked by the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association (WHA) to watch out for any notable Swedish hockey players, and he recommended both Nilsson and Anders Hedberg, who was one of Wilson's interns. Both would join the Jets in 1974. At the time the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League owned Nilsson's NHL rights, but by going to the WHA there was no compensation required.\nPart of the first major wave of Europeans to star in North American hockey, Nilsson was a major star in the World Hockey Association from 1974 to 1978. He scored at least 114 points in each of his four seasons in the upstart league, finishing third or fourth among overall scorers every time. He led the WHA with 85 assists in 1976–77, and tied Marc Tardif for the lead the next season with 89. Along with countryman Anders Hedberg and established superstar Bobby Hull, he played a starring role as the Jets won Avco Cup titles in 1976 and 1978. In the 1976 playoffs, he scored 26 points in 13 games and was named WHA Playoff MVP.\nBy this time both Hedberg and Nilsson were looking to join the NHL, as they had nothing left to prove in the WHA. They were also looking for a massive increase in salary: both had earned around $125,000 in the 1976–77 season. With their high salary demands, the only NHL team capable of signing them was the New York Rangers. While the Jets stated they wanted to re-sign both players, the team did not have the financial backing to do so.\nIn the summer of 1978, Nilsson and Hedberg signed with the Rangers. Each signed contracts $600,000 per season for two years. Their signings further weakened the struggling WHA which would cease operations after just one more season. Nilsson's NHL career was marred by two significant injuries. The first was a broken ankle suffered when his skate blade got caught in a crevice in the Madison Square Garden ice as he was hit by Denis Potvin of the New York Islanders, which resulted in Nilsson bearing the entire force of the hit on only one leg. Although Nilsson has never characterized the hit as dirty and, in 2009, said, \"He [Potvin] was always fair. But the ice was never great in the Garden, because they had basketball and other events. My foot got caught. It was a freak thing,\" the incident is nevertheless commemorated by the \"Potvin Sucks\" chant that takes place during every Rangers home game.\nAs a player of NHL All-Stars team, Nilsson took part in the 1979 Challenge Cup, where they played against the Soviet Union national team.\nNilsson's second serious injury was to his knee while representing Sweden at the 1981 Canada Cup which caused him to miss the entire 1981–82 season. Nilsson was limited to 160 games in his three full seasons with the Rangers, though he scored an impressive 163 points in that time. He scored 8 goals and 16 points in the 1980–81 playoffs as the Rangers advanced to the semi-finals before being eliminated by their local rivals, the defending champion Islanders. After missing the previous season, he returned to the Rangers lineup for ten games early in the 1982–83 season.\nUse of banned substances.\nNilsson tested positive for ephedrine after Sweden's 4–1 victory over Poland on 6 April 1974, at the 1974 World Ice Hockey Championships. As a result, Sweden's win was vacated, and Poland was awarded a 5–0 walkover win. Nilsson was suspended for the remainder of the tournament.\nPost-playing career.\nNilsson was one of five plaintiffs along with Dave Forbes, Rick Middleton, Brad Park and Doug Smail in \"Forbes v. Eagleson\", a class action lawsuit filed in 1995 on behalf of about 1,000 NHL players who were employed by NHL teams between 1972 and 1991 against Alan Eagleson, the league and its member clubs. The players alleged that the NHL and its teams violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by colluding with Eagleson to enable him to embezzle from the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and that the four-year statute of limitations in civil racketeering cases began when Eagleson was indicted in 1994. The lawsuit was dismissed on August 27, 1998 in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by Thomas Newman O'Neill Jr. who ruled that the statute of limitations expired because it had begun in 1991 when the players were made aware of the allegations against Eagleson. O'Neill's decision was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on October 17, 2000."

        "text": "The Netherlands men's national basketball team () represents the Netherlands in international basketball matches. The national team is governed by Basketball Nederland.\nThe Dutch have reached the European Basketball Championship on 16 occasions. Their best results at the event came in 1983, where they finished in fourth place. They have also qualified for the FIBA World Cup once, in 1986. However, in recent years the national team has struggled to maintain consistency to reach major international tournaments.\nThe team represents itself as the Orange Lions.\nHistory.\n1946–1991: Early years.\nThe Netherlands were one of the teams that played in the 1946, 1947, 1949 and 1951 EuroBasket tournaments. During this period, the 5th place finish in 1949 was the best performance by the national team.\n1961–1991: EuroBasket success &amp; World Cup debut.\nThe \"Oranje\" qualified for three European Basketball Championships in the 1960s (1961, 1963, 1967). After three consecutive missed tournaments, the Netherlands had another three EuroBasket appearance stretch from 1975, 1977, and 1979. During the 1977 EuroBasket, the Netherlands' star player Kees Akerboom shined during the tournament. He finished the competition as the top scorer, and earned a spot on the All-Tournament Team.\nAt EuroBasket 1983, the Dutch had its biggest success in history under head coach Vladimir Heger. The national team achieved fourth place at the tournament. The Dutch wound up reaching the semi-finals, but eventually fell to Italy. In the third-place game they would lose again, this time to the Soviet Union.\nThree years after achieving success at the continental level, the Netherlands qualified to the World Cup for the first time in 1986. The national team ultimately did not make it out of the group stage though, finishing the tournament with an (2–3) record to place 14th overall.\n1991–2012: Long mediocre period.\nFrom 1991 until 2012, the Netherlands did not qualify for a EuroBasket tournament. Star player Francisco Elson, former NBA-champion, represented the team on several occasions but the team never came close to qualifying. During this period, notable Dutch players like Dan Gadzuric were not willing to play for the national team. Home games were usually played at the Topsportcentrum in Almere and usually had little to no media attention or fan support in the Netherlands.\nRising from the ashes (2012–2015).\nIn December 2012, it was announced that the Netherlands national team would be dissolved for 2 years, because the national federation NBB {Netherlands Basketball Bond} was not willing to invest money in to it. After a campaign by Dutch players who played in the Dutch Basketball League, the national team was eventually saved. Sports broadcaster Sport1 became the main sponsor and DBL-teams invested in the team, which started playing again.\nDuring August 2013, the Netherlands was on its way to qualification for EuroBasket 2015, but lost two games 20–0 because the team played with two players – Mohamed Kherrazi and Sean Cunningham – who were identified as foreign players by FIBA. The NBB believed that both were eligible players, and was upset that the attention came up after the Netherlands already won 2 games.\n\"Miracle of 2014\".\nAt the start of the second 2015-qualification round, things looked bad for the \"Oranje\". The DBL-teams didn't have any more money to invest in the team and the NBB wasn't ready to take the team back. Head coach Toon van Helfteren, who worked as a volunteer, still did prepare for the qualifying games. He invited 42 players to play for the national team, but after most (notable) players rejected the offer, he started his first training camp with 7 players. The team eventually shocked the world, by beating heavy favorite Montenegro to get the second place in their group. On 27 August 2014, the Dutch national team qualified for EuroBasket for the first time in 25 years.\nReturn to EuroBasket (2015–present).\nThe national team left the NBB and FEB, from 2015 the team was run by the NMT. Coach Van Helfteren then had his contract with the national team extended. In contrast to the summer of 2014, big name players from foreign leagues applied to play for the national team.\nIn the first game at EuroBasket 2015, the Dutch beat Georgia 73–72 behind Charlon Kloof's 22 and Worthy de Jong's 16 points. The Netherlands remaining four games though were all loses, but only by single digits to power houses such as Croatia and Greece.\nOn 22 July 2019, Italian coach Maurizio Buscaglia signed on to become head coach of the Netherlands, replacing Toon van Helfteren who stepped down. After a disappointing EuroBasket 2022, in which the Netherlands went winless, Buscaglia was sacked. On 6 October 2022, Radenko Varagić was appointed as interim head coach for the remaining World Cup qualifying campaign.\nOn 23 May 2023, the Netherlands named Israeli coach Arik Shivek, as head coach of the national team. He previously led at national team level for five years with Israel from 2009 to 2014.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Great Britain and Greece.\nPast rosters.\n1946 EuroBasket: finished 6th among 10 teams\n3 Chris van Laar, 4 Joop Koper, 5 Henk Mik, 6 Wim van Someren, 7 Freek Brandt, 8 Jan Aldenberg, 9 Henk Koper, 13 Chris Kugelein, 14 Wim Kunnen, 15 Ben Gerritsma (Coach: Dick Schmüll)\n1947 EuroBasket: finished 11th among 14 teams\n3 Joop Koper, 4 Chris van Laar, 5 Freek Brandt, 6 Jaap van Veen, 7 Wim van Someren, 8 B Winkel, 9 Tan Eng Hau, 10 Henk Koper, 20 Visser (Coach: Dick Schmüll)\n1949 EuroBasket: finished 5th among 7 teams\n3 Jaap van Veen, 4 Jaap van Veen, 5 Tom Losekoot, 6 Tan Eng Hau, 7 Henk Koper, 8 Joop Koper, 9 Wim van Someren, 10 Henk van de Broek, 11 Jan Hille, 20 Freek Brandt (Coach: Dick Schmüll)\n1951 EuroBasket: finished 10th among 17 teams\n3 Tim de Jong, 4 Johan de Hoop, 5 Bob van der Valk, 6 Ab Gootjes, 7 Jaap van Veen, 8 Henk van de Broek, 9 Vok Alberda, 10 Kees van der Schuijt, 11 Jan Hille, 12 Piet Ouderland, 13 Ton Koemans, 14 Rinus van Eijkeren (Coach: Dick Schmüll)\n1961 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 19 teams\n4 Henny Braun, 5 Antonie Boot, 6 Jan Bruin, 7 Jan Driehuis, 8 Dolf Pouw, 9 Wim Franke, 10 Maarten Sleeswijk, 11 Gerrit Kok, 12 Peter de Jong, 13 Gunter van de Berg, 14 Franciscus de Haan, 15 Hans Perrier (Coach: Jan Janbroers)\n1963 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\n4 Jos Pelk, 5 Antonie Boot, 6 Jan Bruin, 7 Jan Driehuis, 8 Simon Schagen, 9 Bob Grosmann, 10 Wim Franke, 11 Gerrit Kok, 12 Roelof Tuinstra, 13 Jan Schappert, 14 Franciscus de Haan, 15 Frederik Witte (Coach: Jan Janbroers) \n1967 EuroBasket: finished 16th among 16 teams\n4 Petrus Rijsewik, 5 Antonie Boot, 6 Jan Bruin, 7 Frank Kales, 8 Antonius van der Kroon, 9 Karel Pastor, 10 Karel Vrolijk, 11 Erik Jager, 12 Roelof Tuinstra, 13 Erik van Woerkom, 14 Franciscus de Haan, 15 Frederik Witte (Coach: Egon Steuer)\n1975 EuroBasket: finished 10th among 12 teams\n4 Jan Dekker, 5 Antonie Boot, 6 Jan Sikking, 7 Hugo Harrewijn, 8 Herman Pluim, 9 Walter Ombre, 10 John van Vliet, 11 Kees Akerboom, 12 Dan Cramer, 13 Toon van Helfteren, 14 Pieter van Tuyll, 15 Harry Kip (Coach: Bill Sheridan)\n1977 EuroBasket: finished 7th among 12 teams\n4 Al Faber, 5 Jan Dekker, 6 Jimmy Woudstra, 7 Cees Limmen, 8 Emill Hagens, 9 Bert Kragtwijk, 10 Cock van de Lagemaat, 11 Dan Cramer, 12 Kees Akerboom, 13 Jan Loorbach, 14 Renso Zwiers, 15 Harry Kip (Coach: Jan Janbroers)\n1979 EuroBasket: finished 10th among 12 teams\n4 Bert Kragtwijk, 5 Jan Dekker, 6 Dan Cramer, 7 Mitchell Plaat, 8 Emill Hagens, 9 Al Faber, 10 Sid Bruinsma, 11 Jimmy Woudstra, 12 Kees Akerboom, 13 Toon van Helfteren, 14 Pieter van Tuyll, 15 Harry Kip (Coach: Tom Quinn)\n1983 EuroBasket: finished 4th among 12 teams\n4 René Ridderhof, 5 Ronald Schilp, 6 Randy Wiel, 7 Mitchell Plaat, 8 Jelle Esveldt, 9 Al Faber, 10 Jos Kuipers, 11 Dan Cramer, 12 Cock van de Lagemaat, 13 Henk Pieterse, 14 Roland van den Bergh, 15 Rob van Essen (Coach: Vladimír Heger) \n1985 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 12 teams\n4 Martin Esajas, 5 Ronald Schilp, 6 Martin de Vries, 7 Marco de Waard, 8 Jelle Esveldt, 9 Ron van der Schaaf, 10 John Franken, 11 Cock van de Lagemaat, 12 Jos Kuipers, 13 Peter van Noord, 14 Hans Heijdeman, 15 Rob van Essen (Coach: Vladimír Heger)\n1986 FIBA World Cup: finished 14th among 24 teams\n4 Rik Smits, 5 Jelle Esveldt, 6 Ronald Schilp, 7 Cock van de Lagemaat, 8 Raymond Bottse, 9 Rene Ebeltjes, 10 Chris van Dinten, 11 Hans Heijdeman, 12 Erik Griekspoor, 13 Emill Hagens, 14 Marco de Waard, 15 Peter van Noord (Coach: Ruud Harrewijn)\n1987 EuroBasket: finished 10th among 12 teams\n4 John Emanuels, 5 Ronald Schilp, 6 Marco de Waard, 7 Cees van Rootselaar, 8 Jelle Esveldt, 9 Okke te Velde, 10 Rik Smits, 11 Chris van Dinten, 12 Peter van Noord, 13 Toon van Helfteren, 14 Henk Pieterse, 15 Jos Kuipers (Coach: Ruud Harrewijn)\n1989 EuroBasket: finished 8th among 8 teams\n4 Raymond Bottse, 5 John Emanuels, 6 Marco de Waard, 7 Cees van Rootselaar, 8 Rolf Franke, 9 Okke te Velde, 10 Richard van Poelgeest, 11 Frans Houben, 12 Milko Lieverst, 13 Paul Vrind, 14 Peter Dam, 15 Jos Kuipers (Coach: Ruud Harrewijn)\n2015 EuroBasket: finished 21st among 24 teams\n0 Yannick Franke, 5 Leon Williams, 6 Worthy de Jong, 7 Charlon Kloof, 9 Mohamed Kherrazi, 10 Ralf de Pagter, 12 Kees Akerboom, Jr., 13 Roeland Schaftenaar, 18 Nicolas de Jong, 21 Robin Smeulders, 23 Henk Norel, 44 Arvin Slagter (C) (Coach: Toon van Helfteren)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 22nd among 24 teams\n0 Yannick Franke, 1 Keye van der Vuurst de Vries, 5 Leon Williams, 6 Worthy de Jong (C), 9 Mohamed Kherrazi, 11 Shane Hammink,&lt;br&gt;13 Roeland Schaftenaar, 14 Jesse Edwards, 30 Olaf Schaftenaar, 32 Matt Haarms, 33 Jito Kok, 90 Charlon Kloof&lt;br&gt;(Coach: Maurizio Buscaglia)"

        "text": "The Luxembourg men's national basketball team (, , ) represents Luxembourg in international basketball tournaments. They are controlled by the Luxembourg Basketball Federation.\nLuxembourg has competed at the EuroBasket three times, in 1946, 1951, and 1955. Their best result was an eighth place finish at their first appearance at the competition in 1946. However, the national team has yet to qualify to compete at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nEuroBasket 1946.\nLuxembourg appeared in their first international event at EuroBasket 1946 in Geneva. After being placed in Group A for the preliminary round, the national team would play in their first ever match against Poland, where the team would lose 45–28. Following the defeat, Luxembourg went on to lose their next two matches against Hungary and Italy, which ultimately dropped the team into the classification phase of the tournament. There, Luxembourg captured their first ever victory against England 27–50. With only one game remaining for Luxembourg, the team would finish out the competition with a loss against Belgium, to end the tournament eighth out of the ten teams overall.\nEuroBasket 1951.\nAfter not entering the competition in 1947 and 1949, Luxembourg made their way back to the continental stage at EuroBasket 1951 in Paris. Luxembourg's first match of the tournament was against the host France, which resulted in a demoralising defeat for the national team 72–26. Ensuing the tough loss for Luxembourg, were four straight defeats for the team, to relegate them into a must win elimination game for the right to advance into the classification rounds. Luxembourg, however, would lose in a tightly contested match 45–46 against Denmark to be eliminated.\nEuroBasket 1955.\nFollowing Luxembourg's dismal performance at the EuroBasket in 1951, the national team declined to enter the event in 1953, instead looked toward EuroBasket 1955 in Budapest to make amends. After a disastrous first game in the preliminary round, which saw Luxembourg completely dominated by the Soviet Union, the team was narrowly defeated in their second match against Sweden 54–53. However, in Luxembourg's final two matches of the preliminary phase, the team struggled to build upon their game against Sweden; and were relegated toward the classification rounds at a record of (0–5).\nEntering the classification round, Luxembourg dropped their first match against Turkey, before earning their first win of the tournament against Denmark 46–31. Luxembourg would eventually go on to pickup two more victories, both against Sweden to end the tournament 15th out of the 18 teams at the event.\nSubsequent years.\nAfter Luxembourg's last appearance at the EuroBasket in 1951, the national team endured numerous failed qualifying cycles in order to make it back to the EuroBasket. However, Luxembourg eventually achieved success competing at smaller competitions such as the European Championship for Small Countries and the Games of the Small States of Europe.\nEntering qualification for Luxembourg to reach EuroBasket 2017, the team struggled toward a (1–5) record during the process to being eliminated. After Luxembourg's missed opportunity to qualify for the 2017 tournament, the team was tasked with going through Pre-Qualifiers with a chance to qualify for EuroBasket 2022. Luxembourg would get off to a slow start during the first round of pre-qualifiers, losing their first three matches before picking up a needed win on the road against Cyprus 89–76. With a record of (1–3), Luxembourg's path of advancing took a detour, as the team was relegated to the third and final phase of pre-qualifiers. There, Luxembourg would only win one game during that qualifying window (1–3), at home against Kosovo 88–80 and failing to advance.\nFor Luxembourg's process to qualify for the 2023 FIBA World Cup, the national team took part in European Pre-Qualifiers, where they went (2–4) in the first round; and were initially eliminated. Although due to Austria withdrawing from qualification, Luxembourg were next inline to replace them. Entering the second and final phase of World Cup European pre-qualifiers, Luxembourg's qualification campaign officially came to a close, after posting an (0–4) record during the round.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Romania and Norway.\nPast rosters.\n1946 EuroBasket: finished 8th among 10 teams\n3 Alfred Achen, 4 René Bicheler, 5 René Colling, 6 Henri Heyart, 7 Pierre Kelsen, 8 Eugene Kohn, 9 Léon Konsbruck, 10 Joseph Linck, 11 Gaston Poncin, 12 Roger Scheuren (Coach: Henri Heyart)\n1951 EuroBasket: finished 17th among 18 teams\n3 Guy Neumann, 4 Mathias Steffen, 5 Xander Frantz, 6 Fernand Schmalen, 7 Roger Dentzer, 8 Joseph Eyschen, 9 Marcel Gales, 10 Mathias Birel, 11 Jean Guillen, 12 Pierre Steinmetz, 13 Léon Konsbruck, 14 René Haas, 15 Ley, 25 Paul Linster (Coach: Pierrot Conter)\n1955 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 18 teams\n3 Pierre Steinmetz, 4 Mathias Birel, 5 Fernand Wolter, 6 Joseph Lettal, 7 Paul Kemp, 8 Fernand Schmalen, 9 John Kieffer, 10 Marcel Simon, 11 Florent Lickes, 12 Gust Scharle, 13 Albert Meyers, 14 Jean Christophory (Coach: Pierre Kelsen)"

        "text": "The England national basketball team is organised by Basketball England, the sport's governing body in England. England's direct membership of FIBA ended in September 2016, when its national teams were merged into Great Britain teams, so England no longer play in FIBA competitions. England competed in the 2018 Commonwealth Games, finishing in fifth place.\nEngland's biggest success were its four qualifications to EuroBasket, the European championship in basketball. The team won the bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.\nHistory.\nEurobasket 1946.\nEngland's first European championship appearance was at Eurobasket 1946. They lost all four of the games that they played, and subsequently finished last in the field of ten teams.\nEurobasket 1955.\nA few years later, England qualified for the Eurobasket 1955 in Budapest, where the English Team had a couple of strong showings. After losing their preliminary round games they beat Switzerland, a major player at the global stage until the mid-50s. The victory marked England's first victory at a major international basketball event. Later, England outscored Austria as well. Eventually, the team placed second in the five teams of the classification group, moving to the 9–12 classification semifinals. There, however, England could not take advantage of the gained self-confidence and lost the next two games. Overall, England finished in 12th place out of the 18 teams, a considerable improvement from its last eurobasket appearance in 1946.\nEurobasket 1961 and 1981.\nDespite the improvements in the preceding years, Team England did not do well at the Eurobasket 1961 or the Eurobasket 1981 and lost most games. Its lone victory, however, came in 1981 when they beat the elite team of Greece. This victory still stands as one of the major surprises in the history of the tournament.\nCommonwealth Games.\nMelbourne 2006.\nThe men's and women's teams were competing for the first time as England in a major multi-sport event, and it was the first Commonwealth Games in which basketball was featured.\nThe men's team included Steve Bucknall, the second Englishman to play in the NBA. John Amaechi, who played 284 games in the NBA, came out of retirement to participate in Melbourne. Having lost to Australia in the semi-finals, they faced Nigeria in the Bronze medal match. The teams were tied at 15 points to end the first quarter. Robert Reed and Andrew Bridge led the way as England found their stride in the second phase, and they pulled away in the second half of play. Reed played like a snake possessed and was the top scorer for England with 16 points and dominating the Nigerians who had no answer to his all action style. Michael Martin also contributed with 13 points.

        "title": "NES Open Tournament Golf",
        "text": "NES Open Tournament Golf, known in Japan as is a sports video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. \"NES Open Tournament Golf\" is the second Nintendo published golf-based video game released for the NES, the first game being \"Golf\". In addition to the Famicom version of \"Golf\", there were two other Nintendo published golf-based video games released in Japan. These games were released in disk format on the Family Computer Disk System in 1987. These two games were Family Computer Golf: Japan Course and Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course.\nGameplay.\n\"NES Open Tournament Golf\" featured three different courses. Those courses were the US Course, Japan Course, and the UK Course. Although the Japan Course and UK Course are also playable courses in \"Mario Open Golf\" they do not contain the same holes. There are some holes in each course that are identical or nearly identical to holes found in \"NES Open Tournament Golf\". For example, hole number one in the Australia Course is hole number nine in the US Course. \"Mario Open Golf\" featured five different courses. Those courses were the Japan Course, the Australia Course, the France Course, the Hawaii Course, and the UK Course. In addition to those five courses an Extra Course is also available. The Extra Course contains a mix of holes from the other five courses.\nLike most \"Mario\" games released around the time, the first player played as Mario, and the second player played as Luigi. At certain points during gameplay, the Mario Bros. are offered advice by their caddies, Princess Toadstool (Peach) and Princess Daisy. Another non-playable character was Mario's old nemesis Donkey Kong, who now works as an accountant securing the prize money for Mario and Luigi. \"NES Open Tournament Golf\" is often thought to be nearly identical to the Famicom version \"Mario Open Golf\" based on the fact that they both feature identical graphics and gameplay. However, there are many differences between the two games. For starters, \"Mario Open Golf\" featured five playable courses whereas \"NES Open Tournament Golf\" only featured three. The background music between both games also differed, with the exception of a few tracks that were used in both games.\nThe Famicom version, \"Mario Open Golf\" is significantly more difficult than the NES version. Most of the holes seen in \"Mario Open Golf\" are not found in \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", though there are a few holes that exist in both versions without any modifications. If someone plays \"Mario Open Golf\" they will notice a handful of holes that look nearly identical to the holes in \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", but with more obstacles. It is likely that some of these obstacles were removed from the western release of the game to make it less difficult.\nRelease.\nThis game was released for the Disk System on February 21, 1987. \"Family Computer Golf: Japan Course\" is very similar to the original \"Golf\" which was released for the Famicom in 1984. In this version of the game you can consistently see the bird's eye view of the course on the right-side of the screen, while the left side of the screen consistently showed a third-person view. Two modes of play are available in the game, stroke play and match play. Though the course designs are similar to those found in \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", the controls are slightly different. You can choose between three different speeds at which you hit the ball, and you can also cycle between golf clubs. In this version however, the default club will always be a 1W, whereas in later games an appropriate club would be pre-selected for you. The scorecard in this game is nearly identical to the one found in \"NES Open Tournament Golf\".\nThis game came on a blue disk card, when most disks at the time were yellow. The blue disk indicated that it could be used in machines called a Disk Fax as part of a contest in Japan. Players' high scores were saved on the disk, and by using the name entry feature in the game to enter their personal data, players could send the data to Nintendo using the Disk Fax. The winners of the contest received a golden disk containing a more difficult version of the game.\nThis game was released for the Disk System on June 14, 1987. \"Family Computer Golf: U.S Course\" is similar to the original \"Golf\" and \"Mario Open Golf\". In this version of the game a bird's eye view of the course is shown on the center of the screen, while the right side of the screen shows a third-person view. Once you were ready to hit the ball the bird's eye view transitioned to a screen with just the third-person view. This concept was slightly modified and used in \"Mario Open Golf\" which was released in September 1991.\n\"Mario Open Golf\" was one of the first titles released on Nintendo's arcade machine, the PlayChoice-10. Each machine had a mix of ten different NES games to choose from. For each token, players would be given a fixed amount of time to play any of the ten games on the PlayChoice-10. The dual-screen cabinet gave instructions on the top-screen, while the lower screen was used to show the actual game. The typical amount of time per token was 300 seconds, of which the player could switch in and out of different games if they so desired. The arcade machine's main circuit board had the ability to plug-in 10 different games, similar to the circuit board of an NES cartridge. PlayChoice games varied slightly from their original NES counterparts, as additional circuitry was needed to allow the game to run on the arcade machine.\n\"Mario Open Golf\" for the PlayChoice-10 was most similar to that of \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", more so than \"Mario Open Golf\" for the Famicom. There were some differences from \"NES Open Tournament Golf\", however, such as no tournament mode in \"Mario Open Golf\". The PlayChoice-10 also featured the original \"Golf\" video game for the NES as one of the games in its library. It was also released for the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on July 5, 2012, and the Nintendo Switch Online service on October 10, 2018.\nOther media.\n\"Mario Open Golf\" is one of the video games featuring in the manga titled \"Cyber Boy\", by Nagai Noriaki, Published by Coro Coro Comic and Shogakukan, from 1991 to 1993. Mario's outfit from this game is an alternate costume for the character in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\", as well as in \"Super Mario Odyssey\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\". \"\" and \"Mario Kart Tour\" also included Luigi's outfit in addition to Mario's.\nReception.\n\"NES Open Tournament Golf\" received positive reception, and when the Nintendo 64 came out, another game was added to the series, \"Mario Golf\"."

        "text": "Nicholas Anthony Green (born September 10, 1978) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played eight seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 2004 and 2013 for the Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, New York Yankees, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, and Miami Marlins. He played in the International Baseball League of Australia before his MLB debut in 2004. Since 2015, he has worked as an analyst on the Braves Live! post-game show, which follows Atlanta Braves games on Bally Sports South and Bally Sports Southeast.\nCareer.\nGreen attended Duluth High School in Duluth, Georgia, and Georgia Perimeter College.\nAtlanta Braves.\nThe Atlanta Braves selected Green in the 32nd round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. After spending four and a half seasons in the minors, he made his Major League debut on May 15, against the Milwaukee Brewers. His first hit came in his third at-bat of the game, in the top of the fifth inning against Brooks Kieschnick, which was an RBI single to center. He batted .273 with the Braves. On July 2, 2004, Green hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 12th inning to lead the Braves to victory over the Boston Red Sox. He played in two games for the Braves in the 2004 National League Division Series, but had no at-bats.\nTampa Bay Devil Rays.\nPrior to the season, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays received Green in a trade with the Braves in return for right-handed pitcher Jorge Sosa. He batted .239 in 111 games for the Devil Rays in 2005, and then after appearing in only 17 games with them in 2006, he was designated for assignment on May 17.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn May 24, 2006, the New York Yankees acquired him for cash considerations. They assigned him to their Triple-A squad, the Columbus Clippers.\nOn July 2, , Green made his first start for the Yankees, at second base. He contributed at the plate and in the field, hitting his first Yankee home run and throwing out a runner at the plate on a strong relay throw. He elected to become a free agent on October 17, 2006.\nSeattle Mariners.\nAfter starting the season with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 2007, Green was traded to the Seattle Mariners on June 20, , and assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers. On September 4, Green was called up to the Major League club. He appeared in six games for the Mariners and had seven at-bats, without recording a hit.\nBoston Red Sox.\nAfter spending the 2008 season back in the Yankees minor league system, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Boston Red Sox, and won a spot on the opening day roster. After teammates Julio Lugo and Jed Lowrie were both placed on the disabled list early in the season, Green became the Red Sox's starting shortstop. After Lugo returned from the DL, he and Green were on a day-to-day playing rotation.\nOn June 21, 2009, Green hit a first pitch walk-off home run to lead the Boston Red Sox to a 6-5 victory over the Braves. Green's only other career walk-off home run was coincidentally against the Red Sox while he was playing for the Braves.\nOn August 27, 2009, Green made his Major League pitching debut against the Chicago White Sox. After starter Junichi Tazawa struggled in early innings, Red Sox manager Terry Francona told Green that he would pitch the eighth inning. Green went into the dugout cages and pitched to outfielder Rocco Baldelli, who reported that Green had a full repertoire of pitches, including a two-seam fastball, and surprisingly enough a slider. Green was confused at first as to why he was pitching the eighth, and who would be pitching the ninth. With the Red Sox not scoring enough runs to warrant a new pitcher, Francona made the decision to have Green pitch in the ninth inning as well. During his two innings of scoreless relief, Green walked 3 batters and allowed no hits and no runs on 35 pitches. He topped out at 90 mph on his fastball. He also threw one slider in the game. Green was the first Red Sox position player to go at least two innings of relief and not give up a hit since 1944. Green was also the first Red Sox position player to pitch multiple innings in a game since David McCarty did it in 2004.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nOn January 11, 2010, Green signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nOn April 4, 2010, he was the last man cut from the Major League roster out of spring training, and accepted his assignment to the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Dodgers' Triple-A franchise. He was promoted to the Dodgers on May 4, when Rafael Furcal was placed on the disabled list. On May 28, he was designated for assignment, and returned to the Isotopes. He was released by the Dodgers on June 16.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn June 18, 2010, he signed a major league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Mike McCoy was sent down to make room for him. On July 17, 2010, he was designated for assignment to make room for pitcher Shaun Marcum, and refused minor league assignment, electing to be a free agent.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn July 23, 2010, Green signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He played in 40 games for the Triple-A Portland Beavers, batting .264.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn December 10, 2010, Green was widely reported to have signed a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training with the Baltimore Orioles. However, subsequent reports clarified that he and the team had never reached a formal agreement. On January 28, 2011, he did formally agree to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn July 19, 2011, Green, along with cash, was traded to the Texas Rangers for minor league pitcher Zachary Phillips.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn December 13, 2011, Green signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins, with an invitation to spring training. He spent the bulk of the season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs before getting called up on August 4, 2012, when Emilio Bonifacio was placed on the DL with a sprained left thumb. However, after going 3-for-21 in six games, Green sprained his left thumb as well and was placed on the disabled list on August 16, 2012. He was outrighted off the Marlins' roster on October 17, 2012, and elected free agency.\nGreen signed a minor league contract on January 15, 2013, with an invitation to spring training. He started the season with the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. His contract was selected by the Marlins on April 18 when Adeiny Hechavarria was placed on the disabled list. He was designated for assignment on May 2, and assigned outright to the Zephyrs on May 5. Green was once more designated for assignment on May 29, and his contract was assigned to the Zephyrs on May 30. He declared free agency on October 2, 2013."

        "title": "Health issues in American football",
        "text": "Health issues in American football comprise a large number of health risks associated with participating in the sport. Injuries are relatively common in American football, due to its nature as a full-contact game. Injuries occur during both practice and games. Several factors can affect the frequency of injuries: epidemiological studies have shown older players can be at a greater risk, while equipment and experienced coaches can reduce the risk of injury. Common injuries include strains, sprains, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Concussions have become a concern, as they increase the risk of mental illnesses like dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In individual leagues like the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), a public injury report is published containing all injured players on a team, their injury and the game-day status of each player.\nCatastrophic injuries—defined as serious injury to the spine, spinal cord, or brain—and fatalities are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although a small number of them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.\nIn many cases, injuries sustained while playing can cause long-term damage. In addition to neurological damage caused by hits to the head, injuries to the mid and lower body can force players to retire or lead to nagging ailments in later life. Various methods have been used to reduce injuries in football, including rule changes such as the abolition of large wedge formations; a sharp decline in cervical spine injuries since the 1970s has been attributed to rule changes that altered blocking and tackling techniques. More recently, rule changes to protect players from head injuries have been instituted. Equipment like the football helmet and pads are used to give players a level of protection from injuries, while other factors such as cleat size are used to minimize the risk of injuries due to field condition.\nInjuries.\nBecause American football is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, and there are an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. 50% of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.\nThe most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. According to the NFL Physicians Society, the most common injuries in football are \"concussions, blunt injuries to the chest such as cardiac contusions, pulmonary contusions, broken ribs, abdominal injuries, splenic lacerations and kidney injuries.\" Orthopedic injuries to the knee, foot, ankle, shoulder, neck and back are also common, as are muscle strains to the hamstrings, quads, calves and the abdomen.\nConcussions are particularly concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.\nPerformance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) are an issue in both high-school and professional-level football. Steroid use has been linked to an increased risk for musculoskeletal injuries among players. Human growth hormone (HGH) is used by some players to improve performance, recover from injuries, decrease aging, and to lose weight. Although none of these uses are scientifically proven or legal, HGH places users at risk for adverse side effects such as onset of diabetes and negatively impacting joints and organs such as the heart. However, there have been no studies of HGH use or the baseline levels of the hormone in NFL athletes. NFL players are routinely subject to drug tests in accordance with the NFL's two substance policies. Players found using performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, can face suspension and other penalties. As of 2014, the league does not test for HGH use among players.\nNational Football League.\nAn injury report section is common in the sports sections of American newspapers, detailing injuries for each team and the amount of time each injured player is expected to be out. The injury report was created to prevent gamblers from gaining inside information about injuries from players, and as a result, NFL teams must report on the status of injured players on a set schedule during the season. The standard severity descriptions are \"out\" (will not play in the upcoming game); \"doubtful\" (25% chance of playing); \"questionable\" (50% chance of playing); or \"probable\" (75% chance of playing). Teams have been known to downplay, exaggerate or overly detail their teams' injuries in an attempt to confuse or mislead upcoming opponents. Injured players may be placed on one of several injured lists, including the Physically Unable to Perform (PUP) list. If a player is injured in an event outside of a game or team practice, or during collegiate practice prior to being drafted, he is eligible for the Nonfootball Injury list. Players who have sustained major injuries and are not expected to play for the rest of the season may be placed on the Injured Reserve (IR) list. These players do not count towards the teams' roster limit.\nAside from concussions, orthopedic injuries are among the most common in the National Football League. These injuries consist of trauma such as tears in the achilles, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and patellar tendon. A study was done but the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern University, where they studied the \"return to play rate\" (RTP) for given orthopedic procedures done based on a given injury. They found that out of 559 NFL players, the most difficult injuries for NFL players to return to play in were patellar tendon tears (50.0 %) and achilles tears (72.5%). \nCollege and high school football.\nAccording to the College Football Assistance Fund, over 20,000 injuries occur from college football each year. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) maintains an injury list similar to that used by the NFL – injured players are listed as \"Out\", \"Doubtful\", \"Questionable\", or \"Probable\", but suspended players are also included on the list. College players are limited to four years of eligibility, but can receive a medical redshirt that lets them play another year if they have suffered a season-ending injury and have not played in more than 30% of the season's games.\nBrain injury.\nIn 1994, the NFL established the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later replaced by the Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating that there is not enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because he did not have a background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, an NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed by the study, including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012, at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.\nConcussions are also an issue outside of professional football. In a 2010 study by Purdue University and Indiana University, an estimated 43,000 to 67,000 football players suffer a concussion every season. However, because many injuries go unreported, the true number may exceed 100,000. The study, \"Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion\", was published in 2013 in the \"Journal of Neurotrauma\" and observed 21 high school players throughout a season; it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate. A 2013 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that concussion rates in college football exceed those in any other sport, and that high school players have twice the risk of sustaining a concussion as collegiate players. The study found that, as reported by athletic trainers, college football players sustain 6.3 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures (meaning an individual practice or game), and the rate for high school football players is 11.2. The high school concussion figure is nearly double that of the next-highest sport, lacrosse. The study, funded by a $75,000 donation from the NFL to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation, also found that there is no evidence that newer helmet technology decreases the risk for concussions.\nAccording to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of CTE.\nCatastrophic injuries and fatalities.\nCatastrophic injuries are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all high school sports in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic injuries are rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since the introduction of the modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher at the high school level than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. 56% of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.\nThe medical costs for catastrophic injuries can be extremely high—a 2011 estimate from the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center notes that first-year costs of someone who has high tetraplegia, an injury that causes partial or full loss of use in all limbs, is USD $1,044,097, with subsequent years costing $181,328. Many high schools across the United States require students to have an insurance policy, while others offer supplementary insurance to help offset the cost; some schools also request that boosters help families pay for these policies.\nCatastrophic injuries have been on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.\nFatalities in football are rare. A 2013 study of high school and college football players split fatalities into two types: direct fatalities, defined as those caused by \"trauma from participation in a sport resulting in a brain injury, cervical fracture, or intra-abdominal injury\" and indirect fatalities, defined as those resulting from external factors such as \"cardiac failure, heat illness, sickle cell trait [SCT], asthma, or pulmonary embolism\". The study found that, on average, there are 4 direct fatalities and 8.2 indirect fatalities among high school and college players per year, making indirect fatalities more than twice as common as direct fatalities.\nEffects on post-career life.\nIn addition to immediate health effects, some injuries sustained during a player's career can have effects that extend to their post-career life. A cohort mortality study by researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) examined 3,349 NFL players who played at least five full seasons from 1959 to 1988. The findings from this study suggest that, in comparison to the typical American male, NFL players live longer on average but have around three times the risk of death associated with neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the risk of death from Alzheimer's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was roughly four times higher among former players than the average American male. The study also compared mortality risks from speed players (quarterbacks, running backs, fullbacks, wide receivers, tight ends, linebackers, cornerbacks, and safeties) and nonspeed players (offensive and defensive linemen), with findings indicating that a greater number of deaths were attributable to neurodegenerative disorders in speed players than nonspeed players. This may be due to the increased momentum of collisions from speed players.\nOutside of neurodegenerative disorders, physical injuries sustained during a career can have an adverse effect on post-career life. A 1990 survey conducted jointly between the NFLPA and Ball State University found that 65% of surveyed players had suffered a major injury (defined as one that caused them to miss at least eight games): among players that played before 1959 this number was 42%, but it jumps to 72% among those who played in the 1980s. Additionally, roughly 50% of players who had played in the 1970s and 1980s reported that they retired due to injury, compared to only 32% among those who played prior to 1959. Two-thirds of players reported that injuries they had sustained limited their ability to engage in recreational activity and sports in retirement, while half said their injuries decreased their ability to perform manual labor. A follow-up survey in 1994 found that 47% of recipients reported having arthritis. These reports have been attributed to several factors, including the increase in the use of artificial turf as well as the increasing size and speed of players. Dr. James Andrews, a noted orthopedic surgeon, said that \"athletes are bigger, stronger and running faster, and they're tearing up knees from cutting, changing direction on a dime\". Andrews also noted the increase in the number of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, which he attributed to the size of modern players.\nPrevention.\nInjuries have always been a part of football, and various methods have been used historically and in modern times to prevent or minimize them. One method that has been used to prevent injuries is changing the rules of the sport. An early example of this was the elimination of mass formations like the flying wedge in the early 1900s, due to the large number of severe injuries the formations caused. Smaller wedges consisting of three, four, or five players were frequently used on kickoff returns before wedges were limited to two or fewer players in 2009 by the NFL; a similar rule was adopted by the NCAA a year later. The sharp decrease in the number of catastrophic cervical spine injuries since the mid-1970s has been partially credited to rule changes that modified tackling and blocking techniques. With the increasing awareness of the long-term effects of concussions, the NFL has passed rules prohibiting the targeting of \"defenseless\" players over-the-shoulder, requiring plays to be blown dead when the runner loses his helmet, and placing more stringent limits to the ability of players who have sustained a concussion to return to play.\nSimilarly, modern equipment was developed to reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s to protect themselves from head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – players prefer a shorter cleat when playing on artificial turf to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players."

        "text": "David Cárdenas Cortés (born October 15, 1973) is a Mexican former professional baseball pitcher. He has played in Major League Baseball for the Atlanta Braves (), Cleveland Indians (), and Colorado Rockies (–).\nCortés was a member of the Mexicali, Mexico, team who were the runners-up of the 1985 Little League World Series. As a teenager, he left his family to attend high school and play baseball in El Centro, California. He was undrafted out of high school and next played college baseball at Imperial Valley College where he did not attract any attention from scouts.

His other notable accomplishments include being a three-time World Cup Champion in 2007, 2008 and 2010, a singles silver medalist at the 2004 Summer Olympics, 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In January 2010, he was replaced by Ma Long as the #1 rank on the official ITTF world rankings. He was previously ranked #1 on the official ITTF world rankings for 27 consecutive months, from October 2007 to December 2009. In April 2011, he was again the top ranked male player in the world. He is known to execute the Reverse Penhold Backhand (RPB) with exceptional skill.\nDuring his career, he has appeared twelve times in major world competition finals, which is a record. In men's singles, he has won the Asian Championship, Asian Cup, Asian Games, and Chinese National Games at least once.\nWang Hao retired from the national team at the end of 2014.

He is representative of a new wave of penhold players, having good attacking and defensive skills off both wings of the table. The greater freedom of the wrist involved in a penhold grip allows Wang Hao to generate large amounts of spin on the forehand side. \nCompared to most pen-hold players on the professional circuit, Wang Hao uses the reverse-side for almost all shots on the backhand side, with the small exception of balls placed very slow and short within the table during serves. This style of using the reverse-side exclusively for the backhand was considered to be improper, and when he first joined the national team most players did not think highly of him.\nPersonal life.\nWang Hao and Yan Boya met in 2010 and they married in 2013. The same year, they had a son, Wang Ruiting. Wang Hao stated he would prefer his son to not pursue table tennis."

He also played with the Nankai Hawks in Japan in 1977. However, Pierce is better known for his exploits in minor league baseball. As of 1998, he ranked ninth all-time in minor league home runs with 395.\nEarly years.\nPierce was born in Laurel, Mississippi, in 1948. He attended San Jose High School in San Jose, California, and San Jose City College.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues.\nPierce was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the third round of the 1969 Major League January Draft-Secondary Phase. He began his professional baseball career in 1970 with the Braves' rookie league team in Mission Valley, Idaho, the Magic Valley Cowboys, where he hit 16 doubles and nine home runs in 281 at bats.\nIn 1971, Pierce next played with the Single A Kinston Eagles of the Carolina League, where he compiled a .292 batting average, tied for the Carolina League lead with 29 doubles and ranked second with 20 home runs.\nIn 1972, he played with the Double A Savannah Braves of the Southern League where he hit .292 with 29 doubles, 23 home runs, and 103 RBIs.\nAtlanta Braves.\nPierce began the 1973 season with the Triple A Richmond Braves of the International League. After 11 games, he was batting .343 with two home runs and 11 RBIs when he was called up by the Atlanta Braves. Pierce made his major league debut on April 27 and tallied only one hit for a .050 batting average in his brief 11 game call-up before being sent back to Richmond.\nIn 1974, Pierce told the Braves he did not want to return to Richmond and was sent instead to the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican Pacific League. He compiled a .306 batting average and ranked second in the Mexican League with 28 home runs, earning himself another call-up to Atlanta, where he again managed only a single hit in nine at bats for a .111 batting average.\nDetroit Tigers.\nIn early 1975, Pierce asked the Braves to trade him. He was traded in March to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Reggie Sanders. Pierce began the 1975 season with Detroit's Double A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, where he hit .282 with nine home runs and 25 RBIs in 36 games.\nDetroit's first baseman Nate Colbert struggled early in the 1975 season, and Pierce was called up at the end of May. Pierce said at the time: \"I think I'm as good a first baseman as most anyone. But I've never had a chance to prove it.\" On June 15, 1975, the Tigers sold Colbert to the Montreal Expos, and Pierce became the team's starting first baseman. He appeared in 53 games for the 1975 Tigers, 47 of them as the Tigers' starting first baseman. In his short time with the Tigers, he committed 13 errors at first base, ranking third among American League first basemen for the entire 1975 season. At the plate, he hit .235 with eight home runs in 170 at bats.\nIn early August 1975, Pierce lost the job as Detroit's starting first baseman to Danny Meyer. Pierce appeared in his last major league game on September 12. In late September, Pierce acknowledge that his fielding had been subpar: \"I know I made some mistakes in the field . . . Dumb mistakes . . . mistakes that I never made before in my life. I messed up -- I know that.\"\nMinor leagues, Mexico and Japan.\nPierce returned to Mexico, where he homered 36 times, winning the first of three homer crowns. He hit .331/~.410/.599 for Puebla in 1976 and also topped the Liga with 109 RBI.\nThe next season, Pierce once again found himself in another country, this time Japan, where he signed with the Nankai Hawks for the 1977 season. He hit .227/.302/.399 with 13 homers in 291 at-bats. Right before opening day the next year, the Hawks let Pierce go.\nPierce returned to America in 1978, signing a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. In 1978, he played for the San Jose Missions, and in 1979 for the Spokane Indians, both Triple-A farm clubs of the Mariners, without getting to the majors.\nPierce returned to his old haunts in Mexico, but struggled in his third trip to the Liga, hitting just .198 in 32 games. Jack returned to form somewhat in 1980; while his average was low and he slugged under .500, he did hit a league-best 17 homers in the strike-shortened season, taking his second home run crown.\nIn 1984 the Mexican League began using the lively Commando ball and Pierce took advantage better than most – he raised his average 118 points to .364 with an OBP around .438 and a slugging of .659. He was second to Antonio Lora in RBI (117) and third in homers. A year later he cranked out 40 in his second season for the Bravos de León, with 104 runs and 118 RBI, slugging .620. He was third in RBI and second in homers, one behind league leader Andrés Mora.\n1986 saw Pierce set a Mexican League record with 54 home runs for the Braves. The old mark had been 46 by Héctor Espino – in addition to Pierce, Nick Castaneda (53) and Willie Aikens (46) at least matched the old record. Pierce hit .381, scored 111, drove in 148, slugged .783 and had an OBP around .464. Pierce also spent some time as Leon's player-manager that year.\nAfter slipping to .277/~.372/.516 with 24 homers in 1987, Pierce retired. As of 2000, his 294 homers in the Liga were 8th in league history, the best by a U.S. native. Pierce had hit .300 and slugged .553 in his 11 years in Mexico.\nLater years.\nPierce was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001. He was the batting coach of the Sultanes de Monterrey team.\nPierce died from a pulmonary embolism in Monterrey, Mexico at the age of 64."

        "text": "Gregory Lee Walker (born October 6, 1959) is an American former professional baseball first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1982 to 1990. He is the former hitting coach of the Chicago White Sox, the team for which he played all but the last 14 games of his career, until leaving the White Sox to become the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves, a position he held from 2012 until 2014.\nCareer.\nPlaying career.\nWalker was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 20th round (511th overall) of the 1977 Major League Baseball draft. He was selected by the White Sox in the Rule 5 draft in 1979. He was called up to the major leagues in 1982 and spent almost his entire MLB playing career with the White Sox. In 1988, Walker had a seizure on the field at Comiskey Park during fielding practice. He was released by Chicago early in the 1990 season and subsequently signed with the Baltimore Orioles. Baltimore released him shortly thereafter.\nOver his career, Walker hit 113 home runs and drove in 444 runs while scoring 368 times in 855 career games.\nCoaching career.\nWhen he began his coaching career, he did so with the White Sox Triple-A club in Charlotte. In 2003, he joined the parent club as hitting coach.\nAfter nine seasons serving as the hitting coach of the Chicago White Sox, including their victory in the 2005 World Series, it was announced on October 21, 2011, that Walker was hired by the Atlanta Braves to serve as their hitting coach for the 2012 season. Walker filled the role vacated by the firing of Larry Parrish. Walker resigned in September 2014, as the team compiled a .241 batting average, 573 runs, 123 home runs, and 1,369 strikeouts, struggling mightily in the final month of the season. He returned to the Braves as a special assistant of baseball operations in February 2015.\nPersonal.\nWalker is a cousin of Harry Spilman, a former MLB player."

        "title": "Wimbledon High School",
        "text": "Wimbledon High School is an independent girls' day school in Wimbledon, South West London. It is a Girls' Day School Trust school and is a member of the Girls' Schools Association.\nHistory.\nWimbledon High School was founded by the Girls' Public Day School Trust (now known as the Girls' Day School Trust or GDST). It opened on 9 November 1880 at No. 74 (now No. 78) Wimbledon Hill Road with 12 students and Miss Edith Hastings as Headmistress, aged just 29. Over the next decade, the school roll grew to over 200 girls. The first lesson taught was on the subject of the apple. Soon after, the fruit was used as the emblem of the school. Every year on the school's birthday in November, pupils and staff eat apple-green cupcakes in memory of this. \nEthel Gavin became the head in 1908. During World War I, the school endured a difficult time, the head was in Germany at the time and was detained for some weeks. The timetable was suspended for older students as girls and teachers joined the war effort and made respirators for the troops. A fire broke out in 1917 and gutted the main building. The head, Ethel Gavin, who organised the recovery died in early 1918 from cancer. The girls were moved to a temporary location to resume their activities.\nThe new building was formally opened by old girl, the Duchess of Atholl, in October 1920 and it included a gymnasium and two new laboratories. The facilities have now been much expanded upon. \nThe school's currents sports fields, at Nursery Road (off Worple Road) were until 1922 the site of the All England Club, before it moved the Wimbledon Tennis Championship to its present location on Church Road. The acquisition of the playing fields was made possible by a successful fundraising campaign that raised £6000 from parents and alumnae. \nThe school was greatly affected by the Second World War. Pupil numbers fell as London was bombarded during the Battle of Britain. Under the Education Act 1944, the school applied for and was granted \"direct grant\" status. It chose to become private when the scheme was abolished during the 1970s.\nA new junior school building was opened in 2000. New buildings were added such as a design and technology centre, new science labs and the Rutherford Centre for the Performing Arts, named after the actress Margaret Rutherford, an alumna of the school.\nIn 2022 a 3-year building project completed, known as Project Ex-Humilibus, from the school motto. The development included: \nAcademic Results.\nWimbledon High School is highly academic. \nIt usually achieves excellent results in A-level and GCSE exams and it's regularly listed extremely high in the league tables.\nThe school is the recipient of several Times Educational Supplement (TES) independent school awards (known as the Oscars of Education) and nominations, including ones for Best Use of Technology, Inclusive School of the Year and Senior School of the Year.\nSports.\nWimbledon High School has a longstanding relationship with the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the organisers of the Wimbledon Tennis Championship. The school's present sporting grounds at the nearby Nursery Road were the original home of the Wimbledon Championship and the site of the 1908 London Olympics tennis matches. Each year, multiple Wimbledon High School students are selected as ballgirls at the Championship. \nTennis.\nIn 2023 student Hannah Klugman was the youngest ever player to qualify for a W100 tennis event at age 15 years 1 month and 22 days. \nRowing.\nRowing is a very popular sport at Wimbledon High School. The school's Boat Club (WHSBC) is headed by British world champion and Olympic silver medalist Gillan Lindsay. They can boast of numerous trophies and prestigious placements, including winning the National Schools' Regatta and qualifying for the Henley Royal Regatta.\nHouse System.\nOriginally there was no house system, but now girls are placed in one of the four houses upon entry. There are inter-house competitions and activities held throughout the year notably: The Big Draw, House Music, Junior Drama, Inter-house sports, Sports Day, Off-Timetable Day, House University Challenge, and House Debating.\nJunior School.\nThe junior houses were named after famous women.\nSenior School.\nThe houses were named after four of the twelve first students to attend Wimbledon High School: May and Margaret Arnold, Mildred Hastings, Violet Scott-Moncrieff and Sophie Meredith. Each house has its own house committee consisting of a house captain and deputy house captain chosen by staff after an application process, and then Music, Art, Sports and Drama captains and a secretary selected by the house captain. House points are awarded for victory in house competitions and also by teachers in recognition for academic excellence and good conduct, following the PBS system."

They are the only Australian team in any sport to receive medals at six straight Summer Olympic Games (1992–2012). The Kookaburras placed in the top four in every Olympics between 1980 and 2012; in 2016, the Kookaburras placed sixth. They also won the Hockey World Cup in 1986, 2010 and 2014.\nThe Kookaburras' inability to win an Olympic gold medal despite their perennial competitiveness, led many in the Australian hockey community to speak of a \"curse\" afflicting the team, finally broken in 2004 with the win in Athens. However, they failed to win Gold after that after losses in subsequent Olympics including a loss to Belgium in the Gold Medal Match of 2020 Tokyo Olympics - the Kookaburras instead won the silver medal.\nHistory.\nAustralia's first men's team competed in an international match in 1922.\nThe first major competition won by the national team was the 1983 World Championships held in Karachi.\nParticipations.\nAustralia's first men's team competed at the Olympics in field hockey at the 1956 Summer Olympics.\nAustralia did not medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics or the 1988 Summer Olympics.

        "title": "Tom Prince (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Albert Prince (born August 13, 1964) is an American former professional baseball player, and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1987 to 2003. Although Prince didn't produce impressive offensive statistics, he excelled defensively as a catcher which enabled him to sustain a seventeen-year playing career with several major league teams.\nAfter his playing career, he served as a coach and manager in the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Detroit Tigers minor league organizations.\nBaseball career.\nPrimarily a catcher during his playing career, Prince batted and threw with his right hand. He was listed as tall and 185 lbs. After a successful career at Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School, Prince was drafted twice by the Atlanta Braves; with the 195th pick of the 1983 January draft, as part of that draft's 8th round, and with the 76th overall pick of that same year's June draft, as part of that draft's 4th round. He elected not to sign both times, instead attending Kankakee Community College. There, he attracted the attention of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who selected him with the 64th overall pick of the 1984 January draft. This time, he signed the deal, and that summer began play with the Pirates' farm club in the Gulf Coast League.\nPrince enjoyed a strong defensive reputation as a prospect, but his offensive production fluctuated wildly as he advanced through the system. With the Macon Pirates of the South Atlantic League, he put up an unusually low .208 batting average, but hit for moderate power and drew 96 base on balls in only 360 at bats. Two years later at AA, he put up a .307 batting average with the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League.\nAfter a promotion to the AAA Buffalo Bisons of the American Association the next year, his batting average dropped back down to .260 and his walk rate collapsed, but he started hitting for substantially more power, putting up a .451 slugging percentage. He was generally well regarded as a prospect, but talent evaluators weren't sure exactly which skills he would display after promotion to the majors.\nPrince ultimately settled in as a backup catcher, relying on solid defense to compensate for a weak bat. He would never total even 200 at-bats in a single major league season, but he spent parts of seventeen years in the big leagues with the Pirates, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, Minnesota Twins, and Kansas City Royals. During that time, he caught for some of the best pitchers in baseball, including Cy Young winners Doug Drabek and Johan Santana, and six-time All-Star Curt Schilling.\nCareer statistics.\nIn a seventeen-year major league career, Prince played in 519 games, accumulating 248 hits in 1,190 at bats for a .208 career batting average along with 24 home runs, 140 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .286. He ended his career with a .992 fielding percentage.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter retiring as a player, Prince retained his connection with professional baseball. In , he became the manager of the Williamsport Crosscutters in the New York–Penn League and in his first year, led them to the playoffs. After one more year in Williamsport, Prince became the manager of the Pirates' Gulf Coast League team in Bradenton, Florida in 2007. In 2014, he took the helm as the fourth manager of the Pirates' Advanced-A Bradenton Marauders in Bradenton, Florida. In January 2015, Prince was named as the manager for the Pirates' Double-A affiliate, the Altoona Curve. He spent 2016 as the Pirates' minor league field coordinator and on October 29, 2016, he was named bench coach for the major league team for the 2017 season.\nToledo Mud Hens.\nOn December 3, 2019, Prince was named the manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A affiliate. After leading the Mud Hens to a first place in the division in 2021, Prince was released by the Tigers organization on October 6, 2021."

        "text": "Michael Richards (born February 11, 1985) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. Richards played 11 National Hockey League (NHL) seasons, spending time with the Philadelphia Flyers, Los Angeles Kings, and Washington Capitals. \nRichards was drafted in the first round of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Flyers, 24th overall, and made his NHL debut in 2005. He was named captain of the Flyers in 2008 at just 23 years old, leading Philadelphia to a Stanley Cup finals appearance in 2010. In 2011, the Flyers traded Richards to the Los Angeles Kings, where he was a member of two Stanley Cup-winning teams with Los Angeles in 2012 and 2014. The Kings terminated his contract in 2015 after Richards was arrested for possession of oxycodone, a controlled substance, without a prescription.\nIn addition to his two Stanley Cups, Richards won an Olympic gold medal with Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Richards' career also included championships in the Memorial Cup (Kitchener Rangers of the OHL), World Juniors (Canada), and Calder Cup (Philadelphia Phantoms of the AHL).\nPlaying career.\nEarly years.\nRichards grew up playing minor league hockey in his hometown of Kenora, Ontario. He played level A rep hockey for the Kenora Thistles until being drafted fourth overall in the 2001 OHL Priority Selection by the Kitchener Rangers. Richards was not a noted prospect prior to the selection. After receiving a tip from a friend in Kenora, Rangers general manager Jamie MacDonald traveled to see Richards play on two occasions.\nRichards began his major junior career with the Rangers in 2001–02. He was a member of a dominant 2003 Kitchener team that captured the Memorial Cup and led the team in scoring during the regular season, with 87 points. Following the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) championship victory, Richards was chosen as team captain. That summer, the Philadelphia Flyers selected him 24th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft with the second of the team's two first round picks that season.\nUpon being drafted, Richards returned to the Rangers for two more seasons. In his last season of junior, 2004–05, he embarked on another Memorial Cup run with Kitchener, but despite a remarkable 28-point performance from Richards in just 15 playoff games, the Rangers were eliminated by the London Knights in the OHL semi-finals. As soon as Kitchener was eliminated, the Flyers assigned Richards to the Philadelphia Phantoms, their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, for their playoff run. Averaging over a point per game, he became a key part of the Phantoms' 2005 Calder Cup championship.\nPhiladelphia Flyers.\nRichards made his NHL debut with the Flyers the following season, 2005–06, and scored a goal in his first game on October 5, 2005, against the New York Rangers. Later in the season, he scored his first career NHL hat-trick, which included two short-handed goals, against the New York Islanders on February 8, 2006. His hat-trick was the first by a Flyer rookie since Mikael Renberg on February 15, 1994. Richards finished his NHL rookie season with 34 points in 79 games, third among Flyers rookies, behind Jeff Carter (drafted the same year as Richards, 11th overall) and R. J. Umberger, respectively.\nFollowing an injury-shortened sophomore season – Richards was kept to 32 points in 59 games due to stomach surgery – Richards emerged as a star with the Flyers in 2007–08 and topped the team in scoring with 75 points. Recognizing his ascent as a leader on the team, Richards was named one of the Flyers' alternate captains at the outset of the season and was signed to a lengthy 12-year contract extension worth $69 million on December 13, 2007. Shortly after signing the deal, Richards was selected to represent the Eastern Conference at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta. In the first NHL All-Star Game of his career, Richards registered an assist.\nAs the Flyers entered the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs against the third-seeded Washington Capitals, Richards scored his first playoff goal on a penalty shot against Washington goaltender Cristobal Huet in Game 3. In doing so, he became just the second player in NHL history to score his first playoff goal on a penalty shot (the first was Wayne Connolly who did so with the Minnesota North Stars in 1968). The Flyers defeated the Capitals in seven games and then upset the Montreal Canadiens before falling to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Finals. Richards finished his 2008 playoff run with 14 points in 17 games.\nBefore the start of the 2008–09 season, on September 17, 2008, Richards was named the 17th captain in Flyers history, succeeding previous captain Jason Smith, who had signed with the Ottawa Senators in the off-season. On February 15, 2009, Richards became the first player in NHL history to score three career three-on-five short-handed goals when he beat New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist in a 5–2 win. Six days later, on February 21, Richards became the first Flyer in team history to score a short-handed goal in three consecutive games and the first NHL player to do so since Joe Sakic in 1998. He finished the season second in team scoring to Jeff Carter with 80 points to go with a League-leading seven shorthanded goals.\nFacing the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second consecutive year in the 2009 playoffs, Richards added five points in six games, but could not help the Flyers from being eliminated. After Richards' season ended, he was announced as a finalist for the Frank J. Selke Trophy, awarded to the NHL's top defensive forward, along with Pavel Datsyuk of the Detroit Red Wings and Ryan Kesler of the Vancouver Canucks. The next day, on April 29, 2009, it was revealed that Richards required surgery on both shoulders. He had reportedly felt discomfort since training camp and was on anti-inflammatory medication throughout the season. Richards narrowly missed out on the Selke, which would have been Philadelphia's first individual player trophy since Eric Lindros won the Hart Memorial Trophy in 1995. Datsyuk won the vote 945 to 942 in the closest Selke Trophy race since its inception.\nThe 2009–10 season started successfully for Richards, who scored five goals in his first three games, including his second career hat-trick in the second period of the Flyers' home opener against the Washington Capitals on October 6, 2009. Against the Florida Panthers on October 24, Richards delivered a shoulder hit to David Booth's head. Knocked unconscious, Booth fell awkwardly on his head and neck and had to be carried of the ice on a stretcher. Richards was given a game misconduct, but was not suspended by the NHL.\nFrom the outset of the season, Richards was involved in an ongoing feud with the Philadelphia media. He issued a verbal boycott against the media in October 2009 after he was asked if the trade of forward Joffrey Lupul to the Anaheim Ducks was the result of a partying lifestyle that many players on the team were accused of sharing. Accusations of team players drinking and partying excessively continued throughout the season, specifically with Richards and Jeff Carter. As the team began to lose, Richards criticized the local media in an interview with \"The Hockey News\" for \"throwing the team under the bus.\" He also told the \"Philadelphia Daily News\" that the drinking accusations were fabricated. Following a loss to the Washington Capitals on January 17, 2010, Richards reportedly engaged in a verbal exchange with reporters outside the Flyers' locker room, telling them he was unhappy with how the team was being covered in the media. On February 1, 2010, Richards scored his 100th career NHL goal. The Flyers barely scraped into the playoffs, winning in a shootout in their last game of the season to secure their place. However, they then embarked on a remarkable run to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, a run in which Richards cemented his captaincy and scored some important goals leading to renewed comparisons to Bobby Clarke, which eventually ended in the Stanley Cup Finals when the Flyers lost 4–3 in overtime of Game 6 to the Chicago Blackhawks.\nRichards scored 23 goals to go along with 43 assists during the 2010–11 season as the Flyers earned the second seed in the Eastern Conference, and played the Buffalo Sabres in the first round of the 2011 playoffs. After eliminating the Sabres in seven games, Richards and the Flyers were eliminated by the Boston Bruins in a four-game sweep. Richards recorded one goal and six assists during the playoffs.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nRichards and Flyers prospect Rob Bordson were traded to the Los Angeles Kings on June 23, 2011. In return, the Flyers received Wayne Simmonds, Brayden Schenn, and Los Angeles' 2012 second-round draft pick. Richards reacted to the major deal by saying, \"I was very shocked. At first I was shocked and then excited – I’m excited to move out to L.A. and be a part of a team that has a ton of great players. I’m just looking forward to helping them out.\" A Dan Gross article suggested that Richards' \"hard-partying ways\" influenced the Flyers' decision to trade Richards. However, Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren stated that it was \"preposterous\" that partying had anything to do with the trade. Jeff Carter was also traded, being sent to the Columbus Blue Jackets. Richards and Carter were reportedly traded due to their long contracts and to clear up cap space for Ilya Bryzgalov.\nOn October 15, 2011, Richards returned to Philadelphia and received a standing ovation from the crowd. He would assist on the winning goal, as the Kings won the game 3–2. Richards suffered a concussion and missed eight games during the season. He was later reunited with Carter on February 23, 2012, upon Carter's trade to the Kings from the Columbus Blue Jackets. On May 3, 2012, during Game 3 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Richards recorded his first career Gordie Howe hat trick when he got into a fight with Jamie Langenbrunner of the St. Louis Blues at 14:00 of the first period, scored a goal at 9:31 of the second, and recorded an assist at 11:48 of the third. On June 11, Richards won the Stanley Cup with the Kings, recording four goals and 11 assists in 20 playoff games. The following campaign, he recorded 32 points in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season as the Kings would fail in their bid to repeat as Cup champions, losing to the eventual champion Chicago Blackhawks in the 2013 playoffs.\nOn June 13, 2014, Richards became a Stanley Cup champion for the second time when the Kings defeated the New York Rangers 3–2 in double overtime in Game 5.\nOn January 26, 2015, Richards was placed on waivers by the Kings. The next day, on January 27, Richards cleared waivers and joined the Kings' AHL affiliate, the Manchester Monarchs, and after tallying 14 points in 16 games with the Monarchs, he was recalled by the Kings on March 22.\nOn June 29, 2015, Kings general manager Dean Lombardi announced that the club had terminated Richards' contract, which had five years remaining, for \"a material breach of his Standard Player's Contract.\" The termination resulted from an incident at the US-Canada border in which Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Richards for possession of oxycodone, a controlled substance, without a prescription. Richards' 12-year, $69-million contract, which he had signed in 2008 while captain of the Philadelphia Flyers, had $22 million remaining on it when it was terminated. On August 10, it was announced that the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) had filed a grievance on behalf of Richards to contest the termination. On October 9, 2015, the Kings announced a settlement with Richards, thus making him a free agent. On February 24, 2016, the drug charges against Richards were stayed by a Manitoba court.\nWashington Capitals.\nOn January 6, 2016, the Washington Capitals and Richards announced they had agreed to a one-year contract worth US$1 million. This came after Richards was cleared by the league to sign an NHL contract.\nInternational play.\nRichards made his international debut with Canada at the 2004 World Junior Championships in Finland. Despite a third period lead in the gold medal game, Canada lost to the United States 4–3.\nThe following year, Richards returned to the World Juniors as team captain and led Canada to its first gold medal at the tournament since 1997. Richards tallied five points in six games.\nAfter Richards' rookie season with the Philadelphia Flyers, he was chosen to his first senior tournament with Canada at the 2006 World Championships. Richards scored five points in nine games, but Canada was defeated by Finland in the bronze medal game, failing to medal.\nOn December 30, 2009, Richards was selected to play as a member of Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. Richards helped lead Team Canada to an 8–0 victory over Norway in the first game of the tournament by scoring one goal on February 17, 2010. He would go on to score a total of two goals and three assists in seven games, along with a +5 rating. This included an important assist on the first goal by the Canadians in the gold medal game where he forced a turnover and fired a shot on goal; the rebound was scored by Jonathan Toews. The Canadians would ultimately win the game 3–2 in overtime, giving Richards an Olympic gold medal.\nPersonal life.\nRichards was born in Kenora, Ontario, to parents Norm and Irene. He has two brothers, Mark and Matt.\nGrowing up, Mike Richards attended Beaver Brae Secondary School in Kenora, until being drafted to the Kitchener Rangers, at which point he attended Eastwood Collegiate Institute in Kitchener.\nIn March of 2019, Richards became engaged to Cate Chant. The pair eventually married on July 4, 2020.\nRichards is an avid fisherman and began to compete in fishing tournaments after his retirement from professional hockey.\nAwards.\nJunior\nProfessional\nInternational"

        "text": "Water basketball is a water sport, which mixes the rules of basketball and water polo, played in a swimming pool. Teams of five players each must shoot at the goal with a ball within a certain time after gaining possession.\nHistory.\nIn the Netherlands, people have been playing water basketball (known there as waterbasketbal) since the 1970s. In the Netherlands it was played by people with a handicap. Besides regular tournaments, they also organize a national championship where the best teams compete for the official Dutch Waterbasketbal championship title.\nIn Slovenia a version of water basketball developed in 1997. Till that time there were played two versions of water basketball. In first one there was a classical basket fixed at edge of the swimming pool. This was not very convenient because player were kicked on the wall of swimming pool and basket was to high for realization of some attractive actions. The second version was using a floating basket, making it very difficult to throw the ball in the basket.\nTomaž Slavec and Matjaž Kodek from Kranj, Slovenia developed a special basket (long pillar sunk in the water, with basket on the end at one meter over water level), the ball, and made new playing rules. All disadvantages of the previously described version of water basketball were removed. There is no wall and floating basket problem, the game became very dynamic (as with hockey) because it could be played behind the basket. This game is also played in Hungary. In Pécs since 2003 the PVKK team and in Budapest since 2007 the Budapesti Medúzák team.\nIn Tasmania, Water Basketball first started in September 2003 with a demonstration game between two teams made up of Hobart Chargers, Hobart Hurricanes, Tassie Devils football team and the Tassie Tigers cricket team. The sport has been further developed by The Hobart Aquatic Centre to allow for a more recreational and mixed approach to the game. It involves two teams of six players (of which at least three are female) on field (with a maximum of four additional substitutes), who pass the ball down the pool to their goal end, which is a hoop similar to basketball.\nIn 2005, the Italian Federation of Basketball recognized it as a form of basketball."

        "text": "The European Handball Federation (EHF) is the umbrella organisation for European handball. Founded on 17 November 1991, it is made of 50 member federations and two associated federations (England and Scotland), and is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.\nHistory.\nEHF was founded on 17 November 1991 in Berlin, Germany, although the first EHF Congress convened on 5 June 1992 and assigned EHF's headquarters to Vienna, Austria from 1 September that year.\nIn 2012, the EHF Office celebrated 20 years since it first opened its doors. In the subsequent years, the number of member countries has expanded from the initial 29 to its current number of 50, after Kosovo was granted full membership at the EHF Congress in Dublin, Ireland in September 2014. The EHF represents its members in the development of the sport both in terms of grassroots talent, as well as commercial growth. EHF-organised events such as the Men's and Women's European Handball Championships and the EHF Champions League represent major revenue contributors, while initiatives such as beach handball and handball at school expand the attraction of the sport.\nAfter-effects of Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nAfter Russia launched the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Handball Federation in February 2022 suspended Russia and Belarus both in competitions for national teams and on club level. It suspended the national teams of Russia and Belarus as well as Russian and Belarusian clubs competing in European handball competitions. Referees, officials, and commission members from Russia and Belarus will not be called upon for future activities. And new organisers will be sought for the YAC 16 EHF Beach Handball EURO and the Qualifier Tournaments for the Beach Handball EURO 2023, which were to be held in Moscow. In addition, it refused to allow competitions to be held in Russia or Belarus. The Russian Handball Federation failed in its appeal against the decision to exclude Russia's teams from continental competition, which was rejected by the European Handball Federation Court of Handball.\nEHF Executive Committee.\nFollowing is the EHF Executive Committee for the term 2021 – 2025.\nCompetitions.\nResults History:\nMedals.\nLast Update:15 August 2023\nAffiliated Members.\nAssociated federations\nEHF European Championships.\nThe European Men's Handball Championship and European Women's Handball Championship are the flagship national team events of the European Handball Federation and rank amongst the leading indoor sports events on the international sports market. First played in 1994, the EHF EUROs have taken place in host nations across the continent on a biennial basis, with the men's event held in January and the women's in December.\nThe Men's EHF EURO 2012, held in Serbia, attracted a cumulative global TV audience of 1.47 billion, and was transmitted by 75 broadcasters in more than 200 territories. A record 302,688 spectators also followed the event live in five venues across the countries.\nThe Men's EHF EURO 2014 in Denmark has set a new attendance record with 316,000 spectators.\nIn 2020, the first Men's EHF EURO with 24 participating teams was held in Sweden, Austria and Norway. This championship broke a variety of records, including the attendance record with 500,000 fans following the matches live in the different venues. It was also the first time that a Men's EHF European Championship was organised by three hosts.\nThe Women's EHF EURO 2014 in Hungary and Croatia achieved a cumulative audience of 723 million, which is the highest ever result for the championship. The result marks not only a 90 per cent increase on the 2012 edition (380 million), but also significantly tops the previous record set in 2006 (461 million). In terms of broadcast hours, the results were equally remarkable. With 1,919 broadcast hours, the tournament further confirmed its upward trend through a 65 per cent climb of 758 hours compared to 2012. Overall, the tournament was aired in 145 countries.\nFollowing the extension to 24 teams for the Men's EHF EURO, the Women's EHF EURO will be played for the first time with 24 participants in December 2024. The 2024 championship will be played in Austria, Hungary and Switzerland.\nEHF Champions League.\nThe EHF Champions League was launched in the 1993–94 season for both men's and women's teams. The competition has developed considerably over the years, with the introduction of a distinctive blue lagoon and black floor in the 2007–08 season, the creation of an 'EHF Champions League' ball as well as changes to the format of the competition, which saw the introduction of a new 'Last 16' and the VELUX EHF FINAL4 in the 2009–10 season. From the start of the 2011–12 season, the VELUX Group added their name to the men's competition as title sponsor, and the competition became the VELUX EHF Champions League. The 20th jubilee season (2012–13) saw the launch of a brand new corporate identity and logo.\nThe women's competition also introduced the final tournament for the first time in the 2013–14 season and added the quarter-final stage in the following edition.\nA new playing system was introduced for the EHF Champions League, for both the men's and the women's competition, with the beginning of the 2020/21 season. In both events, 16 teams are registered, divided into two groups of eight in the group phase. The first six teams of each group qualify for the knockout rounds, the last four eventually qualify for the EHF FINAL4 events which are played in Cologne (men) and Budapest (women).\nFor the men's competition, a new title sponsor was presented with the beginning of the 2022/23 season. The EHF Champions League was subsequently renamed to Machineseeker EHF Champions League.\nEHF European Cup competitions.\nOver 250 clubs take part in the EHF European Cup competitions, which include EHF European League and EHF European Cup. The 2012–13 season saw a change to the men's European Cup competitions with the amalgamation of the EHF Cup and the Cup Winners' Cup to become simply the 'EHF Cup'. The change was introduced in order to create a three-tier competition system with the VELUX EHF Champions League at the top, followed by the EHF Cup and then the Challenge Cup. The same merging is planned for the 2016–17 season in the women's competitions. The EHF administers over 730 European club matches each year, which take place in all corners of the continent.\nBeach handball.\nBeach handball originated on the beaches of Italy in the 1990s and has established itself as a sport in its own right within the EHF with the organisation of the European Beach Tour and European Championships for men, women and younger age categories. The first European Beach Handball Championships were held in 2000 in Gaeta (Italy) and the most recent was held in Lloret de Mar (Spain) in the summer of 2015. Beach handball is a World Games sport, making its debut in 2009. It will also have its premiere at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires.\nDevelopment.\nThe EHF has a number of projects and initiatives through which it supports the development of the sport generally and also in its member federations. These include:\nDress code rules.\nOn 19 July 2021, at the Beach Handball EURO 2021 tournament, the EHF Disciplinary Commission imposed a fine of per player, for a total fine of for wearing shorts instead of wearing bikini bottoms. This has led to claims of sexism within the organization from several people, including Norwegian Member of Parliament Lene Westgaard-Halle. The EHF released a statement saying that \"The EHF is committed to bring this topic forward in the interest of its member federations, however it must also be said that a change of the rules can only happen at IHF level\". \nIn October 2021, the International Handball Federation announced an update to its clothing regulations, with the new regulations for women’s uniforms allowing female players the wearing of shorts."

        "title": "Phil Gould (rugby league)",
        "text": "Phillip Ronald Gould (born 24 January 1958), also nicknamed \"Gus\", is an Australian rugby league broadcaster, journalist, administrator and formerly a player and coach. He works as the General Manager of Football for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in the National Rugby League (NRL).\nBackground.\nGould was born in Sydney, New South Wales in January 1958. He played junior rugby league with Wentworthville Magpies.\nPlaying career.\nGraded by Penrith in 1976, he spent two years in the lower grades, before becoming a regular first-grader in 1979. Following the retirement of Penrith's British import star Mike Stephenson, Gould was selected as captain of the Panthers at the age of 20, becoming the youngest New South Wales Rugby League premiership captain since Dave Brown led Easts in the 1930s. The 1979 season marked the beginning of injury troubles for Gould which ultimately kept him on the sidelines for most of 1980 and which recurred later in his career. Specifically Gould suffered an eye injury which posed a risk of separation of the retina.\nGould moved to Newtown in 1981, where Warren Ryan was still honing his innovative coaching approach that transformed the way that top-grade rugby league was played in Australia throughout the next decade. After being also-rans for many years, a turnaround was achieved when Newtown made the 1981 Grand Final against Parramatta, though losing 20–11.\nGould signed with Canterbury in 1983 under Ted Glossop, losing in the final to Parramatta 18–4. By now Gould had become regarded as an astute ball-playing forward. Years of playing \"smart\" to avoid further eye damage had tuned his ball distribution and organising skills. In 1984, under Warren Ryan at Canterbury, Gould was expected to be selected for City Firsts. However, he broke his ankle the afternoon before the selections were announced and didn't get back to first grade before season's end, taking no part in the club's 6–4 Grand Final win over Parramatta.\nInjuries also took a toll on Gould's 1985 season with Canterbury. He played only 14 first-grade games that year and captained the reserve-grade side into the semi-finals.\nAfter leaving Canterbury at the end of that season, Gould played the final year of his career with South Sydney in 1986, taking the field in 23 first-grade games. It was a springboard to his coaching career as Souths coach George Piggins – himself in his inaugural coaching year – welcomed Gould's opinion and insight on tactics and encouraged Gould to take a leadership role. Souths finished as runner-up in the minor premiership and Piggins was awarded Dally M coach of the year.\nOverall, in his playing career, Gould made 103 first-grade appearances across four clubs.\nPost-retirement weight gain led to the nickname 'Gus' due to the resemblance to the Mr Squiggle character.\nCoaching career.\nA successful coaching career followed for Gould. His first five coaching seasons brought two premierships (with Canterbury in 1988 and Penrith in 1991) and a loss in a Grand Final (with Penrith in 1990). Following their 1991 grand final victory, Gould travelled with the Panthers to England for the 1991 World Club Challenge which was lost to Wigan.\nIn 1992, Gould took over as coach of New South Wales in the State of Origin series. The Blues were victorious for the next three series. In 1995, at the start of the Super League war, Gould's NSW side lost 3–0 to the Paul Vautin-coached team of relative unknowns patched together from the ranks of Queenlanders loyal to the ARL. The following year, NSW completed a series whitewash of its own with the Brad Fittler-captained Blues becoming the first and only team to go through a series with the same unchanged squad of 17 players. Gould then stood down, having inspired four NSW series wins in five years.\nWhile coach of the Panthers, during a 1994 match Gould was sent from his seat on the sideline to the dressing room by referee Bill Harrigan. Gould left Penrith for the Sydney City Roosters in 1995 (actually officially coaching the Roosters for the final game of the 1994 season after having departed Penrith mid-season), at a stage when the once high-flying Roosters club was continually dwelling at the bottom of the ladder. Before joining Easts, the Roosters had made the finals only once since 1983. A long rebuilding phase followed under Gould, enabling them to make some quality signings, one of the most important being Brad Fittler, the champion five-eighth/centre who had a close association with Gould at Penrith and with the NSW Blues. The Roosters were consistent semi-finalists from 1996 to 2004, though no Grand Final appearances came until 2000, the year after Gould had stepped down as coach and had been replaced in the top job by Graham Murray. Further Grand Final appearances followed in 2002, 2003 and 2004 under Ricky Stuart, who won a premiership in 2002, the Roosters' first since 1975.\nGould returned to State of Origin coaching New South Wales from 2002 to 2004, winning two series and drawing the third. To date, he has been the most successful New South Wales coach.\nCoaching director.\nDuring Ricky Stuart's tenure as coach at the Sydney Roosters Gould filled a role as Coaching Director at the club.\nIn May 2011, it was announced that Gould would take up the role of General Manager with the Penrith Panthers. The role was said by club chairman Don Feltis to include direct involvement in all aspects of the football club management particularly the coaching and team support operation. He left the club in 2019.\nOn 6 September 2019 it was announced that Phil Gould had joined the St. George Illawarra club as part of the end of season review and would take up a permanent spot at the club in 2020 He would not end up fulfilling this role.\nIn August 2020, Gould was announced to be joining the New Zealand Warriors as a club-wide consultant.\nIt was announced on July 16, 2021, that Phil Gould had been released from his official role with the Warriors to become the General Manager of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs., Gould would continue to have a link with the Warriors to provide assistance to their pathways staff.\nCommentary.\nGould currently works as an expert for Channel 9 and Triple M radio during rugby league telecasts, including NRL, State of Origin and International football contests. He also does a weekly podcast called ‘Six Tackles with Gus’ co-hosted by Mathew Thompson. He also writes for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\". He is considered controversial within rugby league fan circles for his blunt opinions about the playing and administration of the game. Many of his repetitious commentary catchphrases are used to criticise refereeing decisions: they include \"dear oh dear oh dear\", \"no no no no no\" and let the ball bounce, you invite disappointment into your life.\nHonours.\nIn the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours List, Gould was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia (AM), for \"significant service to rugby league football as an administrator, commentator, coach and player, and to the community\".\nGambling.\nIn 2011 Gould spoke at a rally in favour of poker machines in which he called Julia Gillard \"the worst prime minister in Australia's history\" in part because of her proposed gambling reforms. The same year while commenting on a game for Channel Nine Gould announced \"the proposed mandatory pre-commitment that they’ve put forward is rubbish policy. It won’t work, it won’t solve the problem they say they’re going to target, and it will do irreparable damage to the hospitality industry. It won’t work, and it will hurt. You’re 100 per cent right. I’ve never seen a more stupid policy in my life.” This comment was the subject of a complaint to the ACMA who ruled it was not political comment."

        "text": "Jason Williams (born August 11, 1980) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger.\nWilliams has played in the NHL with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Atlanta Thrashers, Columbus Blue Jackets, Dallas Stars, and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nHe was a member of the 2002 Stanley Cup championship Red Wings team.\nHe is currently the head coach of the Strathroy Rockets of the GOJHL.\nPlaying career.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nAs a youth, he played in the 1994 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from London, Ontario.\nWilliams was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Detroit Red Wings on September 18, 2000. He played the first few seasons with Detroit's minor league affiliates in the American Hockey League, the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks and the Grand Rapids Griffins. In 2001–02, he played 25 games with the Red Wings and scored his first career NHL goal. Williams would also suit up for the Red Wings in nine playoff games en route to a Stanley Cup championship.\nWhen NHL play was halted due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Williams played overseas in the SM-liiga with Porin Ässät. Returning to the Wings in 2005–06 under new head coach Mike Babcock, Williams broke out with 21 goals and 58 points, frequently playing on a line with Steve Yzerman and Robert Lang. On October 22, 2005, Williams notched his first career hat trick in a 6–0 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets. All three goals came in the first period of that game; it was the first time Red Wings player scored three times in a single period since Darren McCarty's hat trick in the third period of game one against the Colorado Avalanche in the 2002 Western Conference Finals.\nFollowing Williams' breakout season, he re-signed with Detroit on a new two-year deal worth $3.2 million. On November 8, 2006, during a game against the Edmonton Oilers, Williams was injured when he was checked from behind the net by Raffi Torres, causing his head to hit the ice.

        "text": "Dennis Eugene Scott Jr. (born September 5, 1968) is an American former professional basketball player. A small forward from Georgia Tech, and the 1990 ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year, Scott was selected by the Orlando Magic with the fourth pick of the 1990 NBA draft after being the leading scorer on a Yellow Jackets team that made the Final Four, and comprising one portion of Georgia Tech's \"Lethal Weapon 3\" attack featuring Scott, Kenny Anderson and Brian Oliver.\nBasketball career.\nHigh school.\nScott played for Coach Stu Vetter at Flint Hill in Oakton, Virginia. Flint Hill Prep finished ranked first in the nation Scott's senior year (1987) as ranked by \"USA Today\". In his junior year at Flint Hill Prep, his team finished ranked second in the nation by \"USA Today\" and first as ranked by Blue Ribbon yearbook. Given his size, strength, shooting ability, and quickness Scott played every position at one time or another during his high school career.\nCollege career.\nScott had an excellent college career for the Yellow Jackets, leading them to the NCAA Tournament each year that he played. During his junior season, 1989–90, he led the Yellow Jackets on to win the ACC Tournament Championship. He was named ACC Player of the Year. He also led the team to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament that season, falling to eventual champion, UNLV. He entered the NBA Draft after his junior season, foregoing his senior year. In 2002, Scott was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC History.\nNBA career.\nOrlando Magic.\nScott spent the majority of his career with the Magic, earning the nickname 3-D for his ability to consistently make long three-point field goal attempts. Until the drafting of Shaquille O'Neal in 1992, Scott and Nick Anderson were the leading scorers for the Magic. In 1995–96 Scott set an NBA single-season three-point field goal tally with 267 (which was broken ten years later by Ray Allen). He also set the then NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single game, with 11 on April 18, 1996. On his record-breaking shot, the assist came from teammate and the holder of the record, Brian Shaw (he made 10 three-pointers on April 8, 1993). This record has also since been broken by Kobe Bryant who made 12 three-pointers on January 7, 2003, Donyell Marshall who made 12 three-pointers on March 12, 2005, and Stephen Curry who made 12 three-pointers on February 27, 2016. Curry's teammate Klay Thompson now owns the record after making 14 baskets from behind the arc against the Chicago Bulls on October 29, 2018.\nScott was involved in a controversy after an incident at a Virginia summer camp in which he ranted and played explicit rap music in front of a crowd of bewildered children in 1997.\nScott was honored by the Magic on March 26, 2006 as part of their \"Remember the Past Nights\" program, where the Magic remembers past players for their accomplishments. Other players to be honored so far were Nick Anderson and Scott Skiles. In 2008, Jay Bilas ranked his personal shooters in NCAA history and Scott was #1 on his list.\nRest of career.\nIn addition to his seven-year career with Orlando, Scott also spent short stints with other teams. On September 24, 1997, he was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Derek Harper and Ed O'Bannon. Scott had been traded to the Mavericks after a tumultuous off-season where Scott, frustrated over playing for the Magic as well as with the Magic organization, had a meltdown at a Summer camp event he was a guest at for children, blaring music with explicit lyrics and throwing thinly-veiled insults at the Magic organization. Midway through the 1997–98 season, the Mavericks traded Scott to the Phoenix Suns for Cedric Ceballos. He also played for the New York Knicks, Minnesota Timberwolves (1998–99) and the Vancouver Grizzlies (1999–2000). Scott did not play in the 2000–01 NBA season after being cut by the Washington Wizards in training camp. In 2001, he attempted an NBA comeback with the Los Angeles Lakers (with ex-Orlando teammates Shaquille O'Neal and Brian Shaw) but due to the abundance of veteran talent already on the roster, the Lakers decided to go with another player and cut Scott after training camp.\nPost-playing career.\nCurrently Scott serves as a commentator for Turner Sports.\nScott has also served as general manager of the Atlanta Vision of the American Basketball Association.\nNBA career statistics.\nA list of Scott's career statistics:"

Each team consisted of eight swimmers (chosen from a total team of ten). The competition included two events, the technical routine program and the free routine program.\nThe technical routine required entries to perform a series of required elements in prescribed order. It had a time limit of two minutes and 50 seconds. Music selection and choreography was up to the discretion of each team. In the free routine, there were no specifications for the routine other than the five-minute time limit. In both the technical and free routines, a panel of 10 judges (five giving scores for technical merit and five awarding scores for artistic impression) awarded points from 0 to 10 in one tenth point increments.\nWhen the technical merit and artistic impression scores were calculated for a total score, the technical routine score was weighted to 35 percent and the free routine to 65 percent. These two scores were then combined to determine overall medal placement."

        "title": "4D Sports Boxing",
        "text": "4D Sports Boxing is a 3D boxing video game, with motion capture animation, developed by Distinctive Software and released for MS-DOS, Amiga, and Macintosh. It is part of the \"4D Sports\" series along with \"4D Sports Driving\" and \"4D Sports Tennis\". An updated version was published by Electronic Arts in 1992, including an FM Towns Marty port.\nGameplay.\nThe game features stylized boxers in polygon-based graphics, composed of triangles, some with names suggestive of non-fictional people. All opponent boxers have different fighting styles: some prefer to attack, some to counter-attack. Some (like Smokin' Joe Blow) have great punching power, some have amazing speed; The Champ has nearly perfect attributes. The game is regarded as one of earliest, and possibly first, 3D head-to-head fighting games. The player can choose which attributes of the playable boxer's attributes to improve: speed, power or stamina. While fighting, different tactics and strategies can be used, like all-out attacks, counter-attacks, dodging, etc. Sometimes fights end in a unanimous decision, even 15 round fights. Draws and disqualifications are also possibilities.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was published by Mindscape in June 1991 for IBM PC compatibles, Macintosh, Amiga, and FM Towns Marty. The Macintosh version has slightly better graphics with a smaller screen size.\nAn improved version was published in February 1992 by Electronic Arts. It has different music, introductions, and adds pupils to the boxers' eyes. The FM Towns Marty version is based on this version, but with higher quality sound.\nReception.\n\"Computer Gaming World\" wrote that the polygon graphics were strange-looking but very accurately modeled boxers' bodies and punches. The magazine concluded that \"\"4D Boxing\" is an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable game with an effective representation of boxing skills ... a welcome and often-played addition to any sports game library\". That year the magazine named it one of the year's best sports games.\nIn 1994, \"PC Gamer US\" named \"4D Boxing\" the 47th best computer game ever."

        "title": "Félix Mantilla (baseball)",
        "text": "Félix Mantilla Lamela (born July 29, 1934) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball utility player, who appeared mostly as an infielder. In his 11-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, Mantilla played for the Milwaukee Braves (1956–61), New York Mets (1962), Boston Red Sox (1963–65), and Houston Astros (1966). He played second base the majority of his big league career (326 games), but also adeptly played shortstop (180), third base (143), outfield (156) and (in the latter part of his career), first base (16). Mantilla batted and threw right-handed.\nIn 1953, Mantilla (along with Hank Aaron and career minor league outfielder Horace Garner) joined the Class-A Minor League Baseball (MiLB) Jacksonville Braves, of the South Atlantic League — which was (at that time) one of the first two integrated baseball teams in the Southern United States. (Mantilla and Aaron were roommates. In 1954, Aaron became the MLB Braves’ left fielder when Bobby Thomson broke his ankle. Mantilla joined the major league club two seasons later.) Both Mantilla and Aaron were vital contributors to Milwaukee winning the 1957 World Series title over the New York Yankees.\nMantilla was selected by the New York Mets in the expansion draft and became their regular third baseman (95 games — 88 as a starter) in , while establishing career statistical highs in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) (.275/11/59). During the 1962 Winter Meetings, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Pumpsie Green, Tracy Stallard, and Al Moran.\nMantilla's numbers improved dramatically in the hitter-friendly Fenway Park: batting average of .315 in 66 games (); .289 with 30 home runs () (five fewer than he had hit in his career prior to that season); a career-high with 92 RBI (). That season, he was also named to the American League (AL) All-Star team for the only time in his career. As the starting second baseman, he went hitless in two at-bats before being replaced by Bobby Richardson.\nPrior to the start of the season, the Red Sox traded Mantilla to the Houston Astros for Eddie Kasko. Mantilla spent that year as a utility player before being released on November 28, 1966.\nThe Chicago Cubs signed Mantilla as a free agent before the start of the season; however, during spring training he suffered an Achilles tendon injury that required surgery. Mantilla never played a game for them and was released on July 6. He went to spring training with the Cubs in 1968 as a non-roster player; at the end of camp the Cubs signed him to a minor league contract, but he never appeared in another professional game.\nLooking upon Mantilla‘s major league career stat line, he posed solid numbers, including a lifetime batting average of .261, with 89 home runs, and 330 RBI.\nOn May 26, 1959, in the 13th inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Milwaukee County Stadium, Mantilla ruined Harvey Haddix's bid for a perfect game. Leading off the inning, he hit a ground ball to third baseman Don Hoak, whose throw to first pulled Rocky Nelson off the bag for an error. (Mantilla had not even been in the starting lineup; he entered the game in the 11th after Del Rice had pinch-hit for Johnny O'Brien.) Mantilla was sacrificed to second by Eddie Mathews, followed by an intentional walk to Hank Aaron. The following batter, Joe Adcock, hit one over the right-center field wall, just beyond the reach of right fielder Joe Christopher (who was making his Major League debut), for an apparent 3–0 victory. Mantilla scored the winning run, but Aaron, thinking the ball was still in play and that the game ended when Mantilla scored the winning run, rounded second and then headed for the dugout. Adcock, running out his home run, passed Aaron on the bases; as a result, the ruling from National League (NL) president Warren Giles was that Adcock's hit was a double (not a home run), only Mantilla's run counted and the final score was 1–0.\nMantilla's Topps 1962 baseball card was featured in the 2000 film \"Skipped Parts\" as the top card in a stack being thrown into a fire as part of a right of passage/growing up event between a stern grandfather (R. Lee Ermey) and his grandson (Bug Hall)."

        "title": "Jimmy Walker (basketball, born 1944)",
        "text": "James Walker (April 8, 1944 – July 2, 2007) was an American professional basketball player. A 6'3\" (1.91 m) guard, he played nine seasons (1967–1976) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Detroit Pistons, Houston Rockets, and Kansas City-Omaha / Kansas City Kings. Walker was a two-time All-Star who scored 11,655 points in his career. He was also the father of former NBA player Jalen Rose, though he left Rose's mother prior to his birth and took no part in his child's upbringing. Walker died on July 2, 2007, at the age of 63, from complications related to lung cancer.\nEarly life.\nWalker grew up in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.\nWalker attended Laurinburg Institute, a black preparatory school in North Carolina and later earned a scholarship to play at Providence College.\nCollege career.\nWalker attended Providence College, where he played under head coach Joe Mullaney.\nAt Providence, Walker's game (much as that of Michigan star Cazzie Russell) was compared to that of the premier player of the era, Cincinnati Royals superstar Oscar Robertson. Walker averaged 23 points as a junior, and led the nation with 30 points per game as a senior. His career high of 50 points came in the 1965 Madison Square Garden Holiday Basketball Festival title game, when Providence defeated Bob Cousy's Boston College Eagles team 91-86 to win the tournament. For his efforts, Walker was named MVP of the tournament. Walker was also named MVP of the 1966 Holiday Festival when Providence defeated Saint Joseph's University and Cliff Anderson in the title game. With the two awards, Walker was the first player to be named MVP in the Holiday Festival two years in a row. He was considered to be the first college player to use the between-the-legs dribble as a cross-over move.\nWalker led the nation in scoring in his senior year of 1966–67, averaging 30.4 points a game. He caught and passed UCLA's Lew Alcindor in the final weeks of the season. Walker's 2,000-plus career points led Providence for four decades, until his all-time scoring record was broken in 2005 by Ryan Gomes. Walker was able to accomplish this in only three seasons; at the time, freshmen were not allowed to play varsity basketball. Jimmy Walker ended his college career in the quarterfinals of the 1967 NIT in the last basketball tournament held at the third Madison Square Garden, when he scored 36 points but missed a jump shot at the end of the game as Providence bowed to Marquette 81-80 in overtime. Walker later said that the missed shot was the only thing that went wrong for him in Madison Square Garden.\nOverall, Walker averaged 25.2 points, 6.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in his three seasons (81 games) at Providence.\nNBA career.\nWalker was selected #1 overall pick in the 1967 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He was also drafted #1 overall in the first American Basketball Association Draft by the Indiana Pacers. 1967 was the first year the NBA had abandoned its territorial draft (under the old draft, which granted an extra first-round pick to be used on collegians within 100 miles of their professional team, Walker might have been selected by the Celtics and teamed with his mentor Sam Jones). Walker was also the final pick in the 1967 NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints (the pick now known as Mr. Irrelevant), despite never having played college football; this makes Walker the only athlete drafted first by one pro league (two in his case) and last by another.\nDespite playing in two NBA All-Star games, Walker never reached his full potential as a pro, partly due to his weight gain. His game had been predicated on quickness. Nonetheless, he averaged 20.9 ppg in 1969–70, 21.3 in 1971–72, and 19.8 in 1973–74, averaging almost 17 per game over a 9-year career. The numbers are all the more impressive when one considers that Walker teamed with star guards such as Dave Bing in Detroit, and Nate Archibald in Kansas City-Omaha.\nOverall in 698 games with the Detroit Pistons (1967–1972), Houston Rockets (1972–1973), and Kansas City Kings (1973–1976), Walker averaged 16.7 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 3.5 assists in his NBA career.\nPersonal life.\n\"I was hurt, saddened, and selfishly disappointed that we never got a chance to meet,\" said Jalen Rose, at his father's funeral in 2007. \"You want to know something? We were supposed to meet this month, we were supposed to meet this month.\" The two had spoken on the phone several times before Walker's death.\nHonors.\nThe basketball award at Providence is called the Jimmy Walker Most Valuable Player Award.\nIn 2008, Providence honored Walker's number with The Friar Legends Forever Tradition.\nJalen Rose hosted the Providence Late Night Event in 2014."
